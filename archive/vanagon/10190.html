&gt;I'll be happy provide a copy of the parts catalog to anyone.  I will
&gt;demand something in return &gt;;^} My own bus prefs lie south of 1972, so I
&gt;wouldn't be interested in any lit later than '71.  No offense.... 
&gt;
&gt;I hereby promise to go make copies this weekend (hey, I have no time -- 
&gt;can't read mail and news at work like you guys :-).
&gt;
&gt;Looks like no more than 10 are needed...
&gt;
&gt;..that's about 150 pages each, black print and line drawings on slightly 
&gt;yellowed (and real cool smelling) paper.  I don't even remember the going 
&gt;rate for copies, but this is a college town.  _We_ have 24-hour-a-day 
&gt;copy centers.
I just made copies of my '70 Westy manual tonight.  150 pages!?  Wow!  I got
off easy with only 20 counting covers and all.  It fits on 10 8.5x11 pages
because it's about &quot;owner's manual&quot; sized.  The only pain was the &quot;flipping
around, folding, what page is next?&quot; part of combining two pages to one.  I
saved a &quot;master copy&quot; on 8.5x11 so future copies should be a snap.  Joe,
Michael or anyone else that would like a copy, email me at my address listed
below and I'll send you one, probably this weekend.  BTW, here's my list
of who has what and is willing to share/trade:

Michael Heron     - 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)
Joe Clark         - 68'-72' Super-duper Westy Parts Manual
Pat Walsh         - 1970 Westy Manual (same used in '71?) &amp; 1971 Owner's Manual
Dave Kautz        - 1974 Westy Manual
Sami Dakhlia      - 1975 Westy Manual
Martha Rubin      - 1981 Westy Manual &amp; Owner's Manual
