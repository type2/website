&gt;I've got a 79 bus with a metal sliding roof that I just rebuilt so that it is

&gt;hangers, to no avail.  
&gt;
&gt;Any advice or tips on how to clean out these pipes would be appreciated.

This may seem too obvious, but what the heck - here goes.
Whatever junk is clogging the drain pipes came in through the top.
Have you tried clearing the pipes from the bottom up?  You might push
whatever is stuck, up and out of the drain pipes.  
I've never had a sunroof, so I might be out-to-lunch on this topic.  ;-)


&gt;Also, just this evening, my turn signal started acting up.  It blinks a few
&gt;times, then stops.  The little green indicator on the dash stays lit, but the
&gt;lights outside do nothing (not lit).  
&gt;
&gt;How should I troubleshoot this problem....better yet, does anyone know what
&gt;the problem is?

It sounds like a sticky relay.  You should get a wiring diagram and a continuity
tester and check through the circuit for the turn signals.  If you do this first
you'll narrow the problem down and save some bread.

TESTAMONIAL
I lost the use of my hi-beam headlamps recently.  I got prices for a replacement 
hi-beam relay ($20) and a replacement switch for the steering column ($90).  
These two items were suspect.  Once I traced the hi-beam headlamp circuit with 
my continuity tester I found that a ground connection was broken.  I replaced 
the broken spade connector ($0.05) and re-connected the brown wire to ground.  
The hi-beams work again!
