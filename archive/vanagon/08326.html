Subject: Re: towing the vanagon


	I don't know about Vanagon rear wheel bearings, but
you can count on trashing front-wheel drive VW bearings if you
roll the car even a short distance without the outer axle stub
in place- the bearing shell can't take the mechanical strain.
	So I'd be a little suspicious of removing the rear axles
from a van and then towing it. Perhaps you could get two old
outer-ends from FLASC (Friendly Local Auto Service Center) and
install them in place of the 'real' axles.
