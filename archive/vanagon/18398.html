&gt; The Loctite p/n for Klean n' Prime is 2556.  It comes in a 6-oz spray-can.
&gt;  Rather pricey but one can lasts for years.  The cleaning is via
&gt; trichloroethane, so don't use it in an unventilated area.  The priming is in
&gt; the form of accelerants that cause the Loctite adhesive to harden more
&gt; quickly.
&gt; 
Actually, I have used good quality trichloroethane brake cleaner
as a locktite primer as well with perfect results and it was rather
cheap, $2.50 a can but is unfortunately getting quite rare, stockpile
it now before we aren't allowed to kill the world with our spray
cans anymore while industries dump billions of tons of crap each
day.
