&gt; Hello again gang,
&gt; the sound has gone away.  So I can't experiment to find conditions to make
&gt; it come again ... but now here's a real stumper ...
&gt; Although I'm not the kind who takes drugs I'd swear that when I drive my
&gt; vanagon through snow (which is falling rapidly) that around 25-30 mph,
&gt; the world takes on a different sence.  Instead of me driving on the road,
&gt; the road is going under me while I am standing still.  This same 
&gt; sensation hits my wife also ... and almost at the same speed.
&gt; Has anyone else noticed this ?  It is not something I have ever noticed with
&gt; another vehicle.  For those that have noticed this, what do you do to
&gt; return your concentration to reality?
&gt; Perhaps it is just that the vanagon runs so smoothly at 30 mph.  Perhaps
&gt; it's too much propane.  Who knows?

DO NOT ATTEMPT THE FOLLOWING IN TRAFFIC.
Your observation is correct (Author's opinion). Now just use the park
lights (assuming you have the ones with the bulbs in the headlight
housing) on a dark night in a &quot;big flake&quot; snowstorm.  I have taken few
fine tours on backroads using this technique. Spin off advantage: No 
eyestrain with reflected light off the snow.
