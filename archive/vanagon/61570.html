I had a fire in my '75 Westy two summers ago, and the pop-top canvas had
to be replaced.  After pricing new (and used) ones, I decided to have
one made.  A shop here in Toronto that makes boat covers made one for me
for $500 Cdn (about $350 U.S.) with double stitching, extra side
windows, removable velcro bug screens, etc, etc..  They made it out of
the same heavy-duty canvas that they make boat covers out of, and not
only is it waterproof, but they tell me it's mould-proof as well.  I
thought about having the cover made out of tent fabric (more
lightweight), but thought the canvas would stand up better over the long
haul.   Just wanted to highlight this as an attractive option (and a
low-cost one at that!)

&gt;A buddy of mine is in the market for a new (not vintage) canvas awning to
&gt;fit his '77 Westy.  Any feedback on brands, distributors, etc. is welcome.
&gt;
&gt;Help me help this man ...
