Subject: RE:Introductions, Garcia, and School Bus

There must be more than one school bus  with a VW bus welded to the top out
there.  I saw one in Bar Harbor, Maine.  It's owner was a college student I 
think.  It was not on the road at the time (a couple of years ago).  I didn't
know much of the VW history at the time so I can't tell you the age of the bus,
but I think the bus/bus combination was dark green.
