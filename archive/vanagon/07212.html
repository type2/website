Subject: Re: holiday travel sights...

Quickly.
My holiday travel sights included a Westy upside down in a incline about 50
feet from the raod along Route 9 also called the airline route in Maine.It
looked like It may also have burned.
 I was on my way home from Boston and New York. I had traveled with two
friends who insisted that we rent a car. It made me itchy and I hate to
admit it, but it was more comfortable driving it in the rotten weather
conditions we encountered.
The handling on this beast was terrible. 
Good trip overall. No camping.
Glad to be home with my own little beast.
