&gt;Does someone have the 'specs' on compression for a 2.1L  per VW?  I know the
real 
&gt;world ones run around 110psi (low end) on up but I'm curious as to 
&gt;what the actual spec is.




Dan,

Compression Specs for 2.1L


145 psi -189 psi nominal
116 psi minimum

These number taken from Bently Manual

My 87' Syncro has compression around 140 on all cylinders, and has approximately
68,000 miles on it.
