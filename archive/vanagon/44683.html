&gt; Well, I've postponed my trip cross country for a couple of days, since I've
&gt; been really thinking hard about a secondary oil cooler for the long haul.
&gt; 
&gt;         I contacted the local VW shop and they said they would install a
&gt; cooler, with an electric fan, with a manual switch etc...for about 325$.
&gt; Said the parts are about 165$. Is this reasonable?
&gt; 
&gt;         Also they said they mount it inside the engine compartment, over in
&gt; the left side, where a spare battery would go. Is this a good place for an
&gt; electric fan cooler? Or should I have them mount it somewhere else? I don't
&gt; want to mount it on the side of the bus, but maybe underneath, near the
&gt; tranny?
&gt; 
&gt;         Any and all advice appreciated, the quicker I get this done, the
&gt; sooner I leave! : )     Thanks, Tom
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;So you're going to take us for a ride eh?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Yeah, come on&quot;
&gt; &quot;Well I don't have a sister!&quot;
&gt; &quot;That's ok we no gotta car!&quot;


If you put it inside the engine compartment, all you do is pre-heat your 
cooling air. NOT a good idea. :&gt;)

If you put it under the van, it will get wiped off the first time 
you go over something in the road.

I read a lot of posts about temps. These things were made to run in the 
Sahara desert! Kind'a like the SW as I remember it! :&gt;) If your 
timing is set correct, cooling system is intact, and you run good oil you 
sould be fine.

Remember, people will sell you anything. Even if it doesn't work.

Can anyone in the group find a referance to what a *HIGH* oil temp is?
