Subject: Bodywork Book? (try this)

On 22 Aug, Chris asked

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Can someone please recommend a good book (this dummy needs
&gt;lots of pretty pictures) for someone doing bodywork for the
&gt;first time? I promise not to post any dumb questions re:
&gt;bodywork if you can (not this week anyway). Thanks in
&gt;advance.

The text for the community college autobody courses I took
is titled _Autobody Repairing and Repainting_ by Bill
Toboldt.  The publisher is The Goodheart-Willcox Company,
Inc., of South Holland, Illinois.  Mine is a 1979 edition,
but I know there have been newer editions released.

The book's chapter titles include:
How to Use Hand Tools
Simplified Metal Straightening
Using Pull Rods
Cutting Sheet Metal
How to Shrink Sheet Metal
Replacing Panels and Fenders
Filling Dents with Solder, Plastic or Fiber Glass
How to Adjust Doors
...
Paint Removal
Steps in Masking
Painting Materials
Preparing Surface for Paint
How to Spray Paint
...
Custom Painting

and more.

I think the book would be helpful, but I'm not sure how easy
it would be to find.

Good luck.
