&gt; &gt; having to pay high rates for gas, especially outside the US, with the exchange

Very good questions, Martha!  Let's get the list to give us a sense of 
current gas prices enroute!  Add your area and the avg. gas price below.  
Use the reg. unleaded price (87 octane) so we have basis for comparison.

BC/lower mainland: 60 cents/litre (CDN$)
BC/S interior:     41 - 55 cents/litre
WA/Bellingham/Seattle:  $1.15/US gal?

For our westy, I'd figure 19 mpg flat hwy, 17 mpg in the mountains (which 
is most of the way), anywhere from 12 - 16 mpg off pavement, depending on 
road condition, washboard, necessary speed variations from minute to 
minute, power loss due to incomplete traction, increased grades, etc.

&gt; Shelley and I spent $572 on gas on our 7,800 mile GNATT trip.  We had
&gt; pretty good conditions though - i.e. highway miles and cheap gas, most
&gt; of the time.  I would set aside a minimum of $800 for the Alaska trip.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone want to suggest how much money to save ahead for food?  I

[snip!]
&gt; I think food will cost considerably less than gas on this trip.  Still,
&gt; I would set aside at least $500 for food (or around $20/day). &gt; 

Yeah, prob'ly...  but remember, food well get quite a bit more expensive 
the further north we get.  You're not going to find romaine lettuce at 29 
cents a head in Inuvik! (Iceberg will be cheaper, though!  :)  :) )

Christa and I are semi-veggies: no land or air faces.  We do plan on 
fishing as much as possible both there and back.  Trout, Dolly Varden, 
Char, Pike!  Yum!
