Subject: friday poem /f




taking my cue from joel who last week broke down and posted someone 
else's poetry, here is something from W.H. Auden.

A Curse

Dark was that day when Diesel
conceived his grim engine that
begot you, vile invention,
more vicious, more criminal
than the camera even,
metallic monstrosity,
bale and bane of our Culture,
chief woe of our Commonweal.

How dare the Law prohibit
hashish and heroin yet
license your use, who inflate
all weak inferior egos?
Their addicts only do harm
to their own lives: you poison
the lungs of the innocent,
your din dithers the peaceful,
and on choked roads hundreds must
daily die by chance-medley.

Nimble technicians, surely
you should hang your heads in shame.
Your wit works mighty wonders,
has landed men on the Moon,
replaced brains by computers,
and can smithy a &quot;smart&quot; bomb.
Its a crying scandal
that you cannot take the time
or be bothered to build us,
what sanity knows we need,
an odourless and noiseless
staid little electric brougham.
