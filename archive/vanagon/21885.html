Subject: radio location in early bus

has anybody sucessfully installed a newer radio in a pre 67 bus that 
ended up being hidden?  i am resoring a crew cab that will be completely 
stock.  i want to put a tape deck in it but do not want it to be seen 
real easy in the bus.  i want to keep the stock aperance.  if anyone has 
done this or has any ideas, please email me with anything.
thanks and Gos Bless
matt
