Subject: Re: Possible soundproofing alternative? (was: Seek and Ye Sh

     I have been looking through some of my design magazines trying to locate 
     the source for sound deadening material.  I've seen what looks like black 
     foam rubber with an adhesive backing that one cuts to shape and applies to 
     the sheet metal.
     
     The particular article that I remember was discussing sound deadening in 
     trucks, big rigs, or tractors, as in tractor trailer.  Anyway, this 
     material was used along with an adhesive which was used between the sheet 
     metal panels and the frame of the vehicle.  This combination was said to 
     reduce vibration and noise considerably.
     
     The foam was available in different thicknesses from, as I recall, a thin 
     sheet, maybe 1/16&quot; to 1/2-5/8&quot; or thicker.
     
     I'll keep looking for a source.

&gt;Background:  I want to spray a 1&quot; layer of rigid urethane foam on Grendel's 
&gt;ceiling, possibly other surfaces as well.
&gt;
&gt;Problem:  I couldn't find any spray foam in consumer-sized quantities.
   &lt;snip out some very useful stuff about spray foam&gt;
     
I once got some &quot;Spray Undercoating&quot; (don't remember the exact name, 
sorry)-- some rubberized spray gunk designed to go on the bottom of your 
car to rustproof it. I've heard mixed reviews-- it works, it doesn't work, 
you can't get it off, it comes off too easily, it traps moisture, etc.
     
But-- once I sprayed it on the car in question (wasn't a VW), boy did that 
car quiet down. Cheap, too-- two cans did the whole underside, total cost 
around $10. It took a while to harden, but never dripped, never expanded, 
just sat there.
     
I wonder if this stuff would work on the inside of the car? You know, 
remove inside trim panels, spray the sheet metal you find there, let dry 
a few days, replace the panels. Would it deaden the sound like my 
application did to that car so many years ago? Would it release/continue 
to release noxious fumes that would kill you dead, or explode when you 
turned on the radio or whatever?
     
Anyone ever tried this? Any words of wisdom/warning/woe/wow?
