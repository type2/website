Subject: Re: Factory Fuel Injection

I think The relay is located on the firewall? Im not sure of this.
as far as carbs, My 75 bus had an engine fire and some of the plastic stuff
melted, I decided it would be cheaper to switch to a Carb, Its not a dual
just a two barrel weber progressive carb. I got it running yesterday, and it
seems ok, though I havent had a chance to test it much. I would of rather
stayed with F.I. But like I said, It was simpler and cheaper to go with a
carb. If I remember correctly a BOSCH relay cost around one hundred dollars.
Good Luck! :)

&gt;Anybody out there Know about factory fuel injection on my 1800cc
&gt;Type IV engine?
&gt;
&gt;The car is not getting fuel.  Could this be the fuel pump relay?
&gt;Where is it located?
&gt;Also, should I just trash the injection system and buy carbs?
 Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks
&gt;
&gt;See ya
