Subject: vanagon waterboxer leaks and leaks

So Robb Lightfoot says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a sister-in-law who is struggling to survive financially. She
&gt; bought an 83 or 84 wasserboxer, new. And she has has to have the engine
&gt; pulled TWICE to fix leaks or a failed pump. The thing still is quick to
&gt; heat, she says.
&gt; 
&gt; I had heard that Volkswagen of America was admitting to some sort of
&gt; defect in these things. Is this true? Is there any chance she could get
&gt; an adjustment? She paid $800 for the first fix. It sat for a year or two
&gt; while she saved her money (she is a waitress, and she and her husband
&gt; are raising seven young kids (from two marriages). Her husband works in
&gt; construction and hurt his back and was out of work for  a LONG time. In
&gt; short, they need a break.
&gt; 

Alright, which one of you Steve's was it that I was exchanging info. with
yesterday.  Well, one of ya I talked and questioned (at length ;) ) about
BarsLeak, which I went out and bought two 5.5 oz bottles of for just-in-
case, and convinced me that it was some good stuff to have on hand.

So maybe a bottle of this goop in her coolant system may fix it right up.
Now if it's the water pump failing, never mind.
