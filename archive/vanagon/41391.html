Yes, the locks can be &quot;re-keyed&quot;, all that is needed is a box of 
&quot;tumblers&quot;...those pieces inside of the lock which correspond to the notches 
cut into the keys. My dealer has been able to re-key lots of locks...and any 
competent locksmith can do the same. Its just a matter of popping out the 
lock cylinder and then reconfiguring...about 10 minutes worth of work 
(assuming the lock is already out).
