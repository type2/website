&gt;Yep...those vehicles don't seem to have that certain je ne sais quoi
&gt;that VW Vans. Now that those shitboxes have been around for 10 years
&gt;or more, its funny that we don't see the older ones trotting around
&gt;with Grateful Dead stickers, camping stuff, surfboards that 10
&gt;year old VW vans end up with!

which made me think of something i stayed up waaaay to late this morning to
watch on ESPN: the Great American Roadrace. a bunch of really old antique
cars running from california to pennsylvania, sponsored mostly by Interstate
batteries. they had some 1920's and 30's and 40's cars. i don't recall how
old it had to be, but i think it was 25 years ... but that would allow 1960's
cars, wouldn't it? hmmm. maybe it was 50 years.

anway, they are gonna do something similar next summer, from Ottawa, Canada
through the u.s., down to Mexico City, Mexico. hmmmmm. reckon any vw's would
be able to run? :)  be prepared for wallet-shock: the entry fee is $5,000. :)

it was really neat watching them ... two really old bmw's were running, one
with two germans driving. all they talked about was how long, long, long the
roads in the american west were. :)  and several cars had water pumps break
... but they always found someone to fabricate a new part for them. one fellow
drove his open speedster 1930's looking Something Special 46 miles with a
busted pump. they took the pump belt off and would drive about five miles,
let it sit til it cooled, then drive again. and cost down the hills with the
engine off. a Real Race, by gum.

wouldn't that be a helluva note to enter a 1950 bus and 1950 beetle! :)
