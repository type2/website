Subject: Re: Pad over engine &amp; Fire extinguisher

I too find it hard to believe that ANYONE could own a Westy and not KNOW what
kind of engine lid they have! I have opened the compartment just to study or
check the engine enough times to KNOW that the '91 has a plastic lid, while my
'80 had the heavy metal one. I personally thought that the metal one was safer-
in the case of a fire, etc. 

Of course my engine fire totally destroyed the plastic one - allowing much more
damage to occur to the engine!

&gt; &gt; &gt;Concerning the engine lid though, all later models (87+) I've seen came wth
&gt; &gt; &gt;the plastic lid, while and 82 diesel's I saw came with the heavy metal lid.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think VW changed over sometime between 82 &amp; 86 from metal to plastic on
&gt; &gt; &gt;all the lids.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Does anyone know when this change was made?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm fairly sure that my '90 has a metal lid.
