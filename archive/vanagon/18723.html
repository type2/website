&gt; Ok this isn't the most tasteful of subjects but has anyone got any good
&gt; suggestions for  portable toilets for my '82 Vanagon Camper?  I've got a
&gt; wife and two little kids that want to go camping in the bus but aren't
&gt; trilled about using the &quot;o-naturale&quot; latrine facilities.  Any real world
&gt; experiences along with manufacture and model information would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Please keep the bathroom humor to a minimum ........Thanks
Not a Chance around here Stratis.... Sorry!

Get one of those kiddy pools, fill it with kitty litter...
When you've finished your business, you can play around scratching
at it keeping everyone awake at night just like a cat.
