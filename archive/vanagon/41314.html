Subject: Excellent Used Car Checklist

Vanagonoids,
Regarding our conversation(s) sometime last year concerned with a used 
car check list for newbies, etc. I've found an excellent one at:

http://lyre.mit_dot_edu/~powell/sherman/files/used_car.html

I don't remember the exact scope of the thread right now, but as I recall 
we were trying to give pointers to those whose mechanical and car 
buying experience was limited.

Jack
