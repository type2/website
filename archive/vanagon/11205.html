&gt;Isn't acetone bad for your liver? You can inhale and absorb 
&gt;significant amounts through your skin. Nasty stuff.  :-P

Yes, yes it is.  I use it for my fiberglass stuff, but it gets to me
after a while.

You know its getting into your system 'cause it feels real cold
when you touch it.

Its the only thing that'll clean up resin, though.

There is this stuff called Replacetone, which is s'posed to be a safer
alternative to acetone.  It doesn't work fer squat - its essentially
pink soapy water, and they charge MORE for it than acetone!
