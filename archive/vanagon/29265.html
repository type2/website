Subject: RE: Metrinch Wrenches

&gt;&gt;Has anybody tried those Metrinch Wrenches they advertise on TV? It's
&gt;&gt;supposed to be one set of sockets and wrenches that would fit just about
&gt;&gt;any kind of nut/bolt known to man... even rounded off ones. How do they
&gt;&gt;fare on our good ol' VW's?
&gt;
I got the set a few weeks ago - they look to be of good quality, but I
havn't had anything go wrong to try them out. (lucky me :-) ) My shade-tree
mechanic friend didn't see much use for them, said the idea was a rip-off
of a wrench designed by Snap-on a few years back (they didn't have much
success with the project)
