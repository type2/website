Subject: Re: Wood Westie Interiors (T2)

&gt;My Question/offer- It wouldn't be much more work to make a template for 
&gt; cutting out the kick panels, headliner and trim versus making a one 
&gt; off set, does any one else wish to install plywood instead of laminate 
&gt; and vinyl? If I can get enough interest I would gladly reproduce these 
&gt; for the masses for a minimum of labor cost and price of wood. If not 
&gt; then I will make one for me and never bring the subject up again.
&gt;
&gt;Also- since I am chief designer of the cabinets I am looking for 
&gt; suggestions on the ultimate layout and configuration. I would gladly 
&gt; listen to any advice about what you would add / subtract from your 
&gt; current setup.

I've been making new panels for a 66 westy.   I bought an 8'x4' sheet of 1/8'
birch venner plywood, and out of it cut panels for the cargo doors, left rear
corner, bit by the icebox (i had to do this with the grain running the wrong
way) and the front doors (yes, i know they came with grey hardboard
originally)  Cutting the panels was done with a jigsaw, after carefully
measuring and drwing pencil lines on the wood.  I measured several times.
  Cutting made little broken bits on the edges, (which were not exactly
straight anyway, so i sanded with a  piece of 2x4 wrapped in sandpaper).
  This happened whether i had the wood good side up or good side down, so go
fiure.  Id cut it a little bigger, and sand it down next time.. takes more
time, but will look nicer.   When crossing the grain at an angle, cut away
from the panel into the leftovers.  I put the old panel over the new and
drilled the holes that way (good side up), so i dont have to guess or drill
new holes in the bus.  the panels are drying- theyll get three coats of
varnish.  The front door panels got Thompson's water seal on the backside
too.

I reused the long panel, just cleaned it up.  If i replaced it I'd want the
grain to go up and down, but they dont make it like that, and that panel
didnt look too bad.
