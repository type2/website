&gt;in the new, November 1995 issue of Automobile magazine, they have an
&gt;article about some snow tires ... and one particularly interesting
&gt;tire is the Bridgestone Blizzak WS-15. here's some test results:

One of the TV stations in either Minneapolis or St. Paul (KARE, KSTP or WCCO)
did a story on the Blizark WS-15.  This is important around here since we've
already had snow (last week)!  They said that the reason these tires are so
good is the very soft compound they're made off.  The soft compound also
means that they don't last too long.  They also said 10,000 miles would be
about the most you could get on them.  You do not want to use them on dry
pavement!

No personal experience, I still have the Aqua-treads that were on the Syncro
when I got it.
