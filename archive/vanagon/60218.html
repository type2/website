&lt;&lt; &gt;My newly-purchased '91 Carat has a digital dash clock, which is fine,
 &gt;but which is set to the wrong time, which is less fine.  Unfortunately,
 &gt;the two little buttons on either side of it do nothing. 
 &gt;
 &gt;Alternatively, has anyone observed and fixed this problem before? &gt;&gt;

Had a similar problem with an after-market radio....

On your luch hour go out to the bus.  At exactly 11:59 disconnect the
battery.  At exactly 12:00 reconnect the battery.  Most clocks &quot;start&quot; at
12:00 when power is applied so now your time should be correct  8-)

BTW, this works on some VCR's too!
