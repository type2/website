Chris, I think I am interested in your insert unit. Do you know of the 
dimensions? I've got an '82 vanagon westie with the ice-box (non-powered) unit,
and what you've got there just might do the trick for me. No, I don't expect 
miracles. But anything would be a help. 

I live in Granville, Ohio, which is about 30 miles from Columbus. Will wait to 
hear from you. BTW, does the thing have a good sealing, not-too-bad looking 
door?

 My experience with those electronic Koolatron units is that  thet suck.  The
&gt; problem is that the maximum Temp difference is too low.  ( -40 F)  So when
&gt; its 103F outside and I would really like some ice cold water, I get bath temp
&gt; instead.
&gt; If anyone really wants to try this, I have a Koolatron B42 insert module for
&gt; $50.  Fits into existing cabinet.  Draws 6 amps.
&gt; What the concept really needs is a two stage thermoelectric module but such a
&gt; unit would pull 15 Amps.
&gt; Can you say BIG battery?
