&lt;&lt; Hi Volks,
   I had an idea that I thought I might share with you.  I noticed VW put
 in a water sprayer on the Eurovan/Winnabago conversion at the rear of
 the van when you open the hatch. I guess you could use it for a shower
 of to wash the mud off you boots or water the dog who knows.  I got to
 thinking.  Wouldn't this be a neat idea for older buses. However, the &gt;&gt;

Doormobile beat Winnies to this idea.  I've seen a '83 RHD UK model Vanagon
Doormobile ( Dual carbed, yet! )  with the shower that folded out from the
rear hatch. 
Best yet, the camper is for sale here in SE Pa, but the guy cant sell it
because of hassles w/ DMV about emissions and the RHD and other red tape b.s.
