&gt;An alert has been posted by IBM regarding a possible e-mail virus on the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;The virus is being transmitted using an e-mail message titled &quot;PENPAL GREETINGS!&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;If you receive such a message, DO NOT OPEN!
&gt;
&gt;The text of the message asks if you are interested in being a penpal.  While you are 
reading 
&gt;the message, a &quot;trojan horse&quot; virus will be infecting your hard drive's boot sector.  Also, 

&gt;once the message is opened, it will automatically forward itself the anyone listed in your 
&gt;e-mail.
&gt;
&gt;Again, if you receive a message titled PENPAL GREETINGS!, delete this message without 
&gt;opening it.

&gt;COMMENT:  I have received this information through my wife's company's
&gt;          corporate IMS department.  This information is 3rd or 4th
&gt;          hand, so I do not know how valid it is.  This is simply
&gt;          meant to be a word of caution and not to create a panic.  I
&gt;          have no idea how transmitting viruses via e-mail would work,
&gt;          or if it would work.
