Subject: Re: In-line Water Filters

Mick &quot;Quags&quot; Forstag sez:

&gt;        Howdy :
&gt;I want to get our sink in proper working condition. While cleaning out our
&gt;tank and the copper line which feeds the sink, I found an in-line water
&gt;filter, by the make &quot;EverPure&quot;. The old filter was about the size of a 22
&gt;oz. vegetable can, constructed of dark blue plastic. Anyone know where I
&gt;can find the # of EverPure, or of other such applicable filters? Thanks!
&gt;

Camping World sells several models of RV sized EverPure units, so they
probably have the replacement cartridge you seek.

800.626.5944

I've actually been thinking of installing one in my bus.
