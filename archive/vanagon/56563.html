Hi Sean,=20

yes in the beginning of the Vanangon in the early =B480 (to 82), VW
produced the engine with the Motorcode CT. Its the same block like the
Type I with some diffrents, there are extra three holes infront of the
engine near by the oli-pump to fit the crossbeam (right word ?) for
holding the Motor/gearbox. And there is an Olifilter fitting in the
case. (Thats interesting for beetle etc. driver when they build a new
engine) Then there is the pancake fan housing, speciall mufflers and
heater boxes.=20

I took some infos out the book &quot;RANDOLF UNRUH BUS &amp; TRANSPORTER, ISBN
3-613-01411-4&quot; (text in german, but the complete history about all T1 to
T4 busses &amp; Vanagons &amp; EV.... very good pic=B4s)

They write that this engine is a compromise because VW had no other
small engine to fit the Vanagon in the beginning of the construktion in
the year 1975. The 1,6 rabbit 4cyl. inline dosent work, because VW wants
to build that &quot;Flachmotor Boxer Bauweise&quot;

But this engine is not what the most drivers want. Top speed is 110
Km/h. No power at all.

Here in germany you cant sell Vanagons with the CT or CU Aircooled
engines, no CAT - nobady wants it....
