michael, i got a chance to dig through one of my books and this is what it
say's.  The intermediate &quot;bastard&quot; motor was introduced in May 1959 on
bus's with chasis #'s after 4 694 47.  this was engine # 3403348.  This
motor was continued until more modifications were done in June 1960.  This
is chasis # 614 456.  

It looks like your bus did indeed have the &quot;bastard&quot; motor.  look's like
you will have to go about building one.  What i have found is the best way
to go is to use a stock 40HP motor and then put all the &quot;special&quot; parts
onto that.  this way you can drive the bus.  the special parts that i have
been able to identify are:

valve covers                  (only if you use &quot;bastard&quot; heads)
28PCI carb.                   (manual chock)
intake manifold               (only if you use &quot;bastard heads)
distributor.  VJR 4 BR25      (cast iron body, centrifugal advanced)
cylender head tin             (has a raised section right by the head ID#)
fuel pump               (the feul out line is straight up, not at a angle)


that is all you rreally need to make it look like the motor.  if you can
get ahold of a case, then there a alot of other parts you will need.  I
know where you can get most of these parts if you are going to try and
build one.

My bood has alot of specific charicteristics of this motor.  if you need
any other info, let me know.

take care and God Bless
matt



ps.  Not wanting to rehash a old subject, but does this sound correct to
     you clara?
