Subject: Re: O2 sensor

The oem part has two feet of wire and the correct plug to fit into the harness.

The generic part does not and you will have to cut the wires from the old plug
and splice it on.

Both are three wire and heated.

Save yourself the 70 bones and buy the generic.  From my recent posts of this
exact same question, it will work fine.  Mine did.

There is a procedure for testing the O2 sensor in the archives located at:

http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html

You will have to search for it.  I think it was posted in 96.

Also in the Files archive is a section titled Bosch Fuel Injection for you
particular van that will provide the Bosch part number with the harness and a
cross reference to a generic Bosch part from a Ford that will work.

You can double check the part number if the generic sensor is a Bosch.

Good luck and hope you have to use a lot less anti-seize than I did to get that
darned thing out.

&gt; Subject: O2 sensor
&gt; hi all
&gt;
&gt; i had a quick question about how i loose power on my 86 vanagon(terrorist
&gt; van). and was told i loose power after warm up due to a bad O2 sensor. so i
&gt; decided to call up my local supplier for the part and he says 140.00 for a
&gt; new one. i told him id let him know. then icalled my second option and they
&gt; said for 70.00 they would show me how to wire a &quot;generic O2 sensor&quot; in place
&gt; of the oem part. my question is what is so special about this oem sensor? is
&gt; it a 3 wire heated unit or just something with a fancy plug and price tag?
&gt;
&gt; any info is greatly appreciated thanks, Jonce
