&gt; 	The '91 Westfalia I just acquired has an ignition kill device 
&gt; 	installed which requires pulling up on the directional signal
&gt; 	wand while starting... a bit funky, but effective even if the 
&gt; 	key is in the ignition.
&gt; 
Not too effective as any thief or even quick lube worker will know about
this feature.

A variety of cars that come into the garage where I work have this feature.
 Chevrolet Blazer, Subaru Legacy, etc etc.  

I'd say this is one of those anti-theft features that was probably once
useful but now that everybody does it, the theives all know about it and it
becomes useless.

&gt; 	Several of my my long gone VWs and Volvos had a separate switch 
&gt; 	under the dash as part of my highenergy ignition mods which made
&gt; 	starting...interesting...by anyone unfamiliar with the procedure
&gt; 	of 1/switch on, 2/crank.
