Yes, on T-2's you can keep your radio antenna extended to full length,
approx. 29 feet long. When entering a parking garage, it bangs on the ceiling
reminding you not to park in parking garages.

OR

lower the antenna to a few inches above the height of the van, when it
scrapes, you know trouble lurks close ahead if you don't retreat.

best o' luck
