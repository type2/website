Subject: no start/road trip--finis

Thanks to all who replied to wife trying to get husband home after his 89 
westie broke down on a road trip.  It wouldn't start although it was 
cranking. 

It appears to have been caused by a loose distributor and a timing gone 
out of wack.

Me, my husband (who is on his way home) and our daughter thanks all.

Phil, Carol, and Tatiana
