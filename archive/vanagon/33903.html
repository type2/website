Subject: Automatic trans

Adam,

By now you've had your test drive and formed your own opinion of the
automatic. When I went looking for a camper it never crossed my mind that an
automatic would be acceptable. Then I test drove a 77 and was really taken
with the intown performance. I came around to the notion that the motors are
so underpowered that a stick really has no advantage other than a lot of
exercise shifting. 

I bought the Brooklands collection of road tests on the 70's era bus and they
had severalreports on the auto. They were fairly ecstatic about it. As it
turns out it is no slower than the stick as a result of different rear ratios
and some other techno differences. Incidentally, one of the strong selling
points was how much more attractive the auto made the bus to wives! If you'd
like copies of those I'd be happy to send them---just let me know.

On the downside, the auto is not a home mechanics project. In addition, most
VW shops don't actually work on them either. You have to do a little legwork
to find some one who actually &quot;works&quot; on them as opposed to just swapping it
out if there is any problem at all. In my case the PO had seriously boogered
it up attempting home repair and it took me a while to find a bona fide
german in a Mercedes transmission shop that could take it apart. Now I've got
a rebuilt transmission with a two year warranty which along with some serious
engine work and other expensive odds and ends ran $2,200. BTW the vanagon had
103k which is about the same range where my old chevy's trans. gave up albeit
for only $600.

Good luck,

Weston
