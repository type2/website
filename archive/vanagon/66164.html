Subject:      Vanagon- Chev 2.8 V6 swap

I'm thinking of possibly swapping a chev 2.8 V6 for my 2liter VW engine (
it broke a piston and rod). I have the chev engine allready from a wreck
belonging to my brother. I've heard of Ford(2600) engines being swapped in
with few problems. My brother is a machinist and does not think an adapter
plate to mate engine and trans together will be a big deal. I'm concerned
about  cooling and the strength of the auto trans axle.Any help or
experience you may have on something  like this would be appreicated.
  My choice  of Chev V6 is its availability,it's compactness, and
relatively high horsepower(Approx 135 in X11trim).
Once again any help or advice would be welcomed.

Sincerly
