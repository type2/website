Hey yeah, this remindes me!  I think I mentioned it
about a year ago, but let me mention it again.

The snow's finally starting to melt here in northern Vermont,
and every day as I pass through the tiny hamlet of North
Wolcott I pass a &quot;retired vehicle and parts dealer&quot; where sits a breadloaf
rescue candidate painted in the Ben &amp; Jerry
theme - much as you describe.  Not too too surprising; B &amp; J
is located in Waterbury, VT, about 25 miles down the road
(go down to 15, then south on 100).

&gt; Ah, heck. For the longest time I threatened to paint the recently sold
&gt; &quot;Rusty VanBondo&quot; '57 pseudo Euro Single cab in a Ben and Jerry's theme.
&gt; 
&gt; A few years back Cherry and I spotted a BroncoII on Cape Cod, Mass which
&gt; reflected the lime green bottom in the shape of rolling hills with a sky
&gt; blue background with white puffy cartoonish clouds. Black and white
Gernsey
&gt; cows were all along the length of the vehicle. The rear most 1/4 - 1/3 of
&gt; the vehicle and the rear end had the B&amp;J corporate typography within a
&gt; rounded corner rectangle. &quot;Ben and Jerry's&quot; on the top line and
&quot;Vermont's
&gt; Finest Ice Cream&quot; on the lower line. I had planned to contact B&amp;J, Inc.
&gt; regarding and corporate under writing for the body and paint
&gt; work-negotiating that the vehicle would remain in the paint scheme for X
&gt; years and attend X number of shows each season.
&gt; The licence plate would read &quot;NO BGH&quot; &lt;Bovine Growth Hormones&gt; which is a
&gt; big B&amp;J concern. I also had occasional flashbacks of the Snapple lady
&gt; invading the &quot;Rusty Ranch.&quot;
&gt; These plans were DOA about the same time that the beloved truck ambled
down
&gt; the road with the new owner behind the wheel.
&gt; 
&gt; Y'all lemme know if you have a dry and straight pre '64 panel splittie
for
&gt; sale. I might just reserrect the concept &lt;Moo!&gt;

&gt; BTW: Can you imagine what kinda crud that the truckers would give me on
the
&gt; freeways! Hahahahah
