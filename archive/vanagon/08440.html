Subject: Freebie&gt;EMPI oil thermostat

Hiya, Gang

Say, does anyone out there want a 3/8&quot; oil cooler thermostat?
The official EMPI description is as follows:

PN  33-5010-0
&quot;OIL STAT 3/8&quot; W/HDR.&quot;

This was left over from the days when I had my Rabid, and I never 
bothered to (re)insert the thermostat into the line.
The thermostat has never been used and still sits tightly packaged
in the original shrink wrap, with instructions.

If you want it, drop me a line and I'll snail mail it to ya.
