Subject: Re: Splittie Roof 'Grafting'


&gt; I've been looking for someone that has done this first hand.  I've got a 
&gt; '66 Westy, and I've got a '65 deluxe roof that I want to mate to my westy.
&gt; 
The bad new is that on the dlx snrf's you should really had a 
re-inforced, double floor.

thanks Jon - please, sunroof buses must have sub floors.  It's like bread and
butter.  You CAN get repro panels
