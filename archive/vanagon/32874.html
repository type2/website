Subject: Quarter Window Glass?

I went out to my Van this afternoon and discovered that it had been broken
into.  The front right Quarter window had been smashed.  It must have been
kids.  They took the ornament hanging from my rear view mirror but left the
tools, radio, and everything else of value in the car.  They just messed up
the contents of the interior and left.  I've got a new quarter window on the
way from a junk yard.  Sifting though the trash they left (McDonalds), I
found the lock latch for the window.  

Does anyone know how to remove this from the broken pane of glass.  I didn't
see any set screws.  Bentley didn't show any more than how to remove the
glass from the frame.  I've already got that part done.

Its only fun doing repairs on the van when I break it!
