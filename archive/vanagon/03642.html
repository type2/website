    Car alarms etc.
    
    I remember one night the first time I came across one of those 
    talking alarms,&quot;You are too close the car, step back, step 
    back...&quot;  Well of course the last thing I wanted to do was step 
    back, so I stood there. Soon, much to my delight, the car went 
    absolutly ape-sh*t. I was in awe, waited about five minutes, and 
    stood too close again.
    
    As I was walking down the street I heard someone else stand too 
    close.  Hope the owner's battery died.
    
    Eric
