Subject: Re: Alternative engine swaps

There was an '81 Vanagon with the V-6 conversion in it for sale a while 
back ($1000, bad clutch).  The guy did a respectible job of converting 
it.  Used the radiator from the donor Chevy and the grill from a diesel 
Vanagon.  Also had the heater from a Volvo under the back seat.  Said he 
drove it to Colorado and back (from Springfield, MO) without any 
overheating.  Not a bad setup IMHO.

&gt; To All:
&gt; 
&gt; The saddest swap I've ever seen is a 2 liter 32 valve DOHC Alpha stuffed into
&gt; the back of a late model Westphalia.  The work was reasonably well done and
&gt; the thing could get on down the road but it  was living proof that combining
&gt; a good chassis with a good engine can ruin both.
&gt; 
&gt; My personal choice would be to install one of General Motors fuel injected
&gt; 3.3 L V6's in a late-model wasserboxer.  The torque curve and output of the
&gt; little V6 looks like they had a bus in mind.
