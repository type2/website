So Marlin Bates, IV says:
&gt; 
&gt; All of the replies I got very not only nice but very favorable which made
&gt; them doubly nice.  There seems to be a much nicer 'tone' if you will on
&gt; this list than on some other non-VW lists I am on.
&gt; 

WhaT!!!  We were nice to someone new on this list!!  What the H*LL.  This
used to be such a respectable bunch of obnoxious dirt mouths!  What
happened to us all??  Are we loosing our self respect!?!  Well ARE we!?!

    .... oh ....

Ahem...  I thought I was on a different list  ....

  ...sorry... 

     ;)
