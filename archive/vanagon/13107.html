Subject: Re: Vanagon paintjob

&gt;We are dedicated to having a paint job done. Even though the Van cam from
&gt;CA and we were able to cut through most of the faded paint a paint job
&gt;serves other purposes, namely protecting all surfaces from rust and
&gt;corrosion wcih can be quite a problem up here (especially if we plan to
&gt;drive in Winter). Yes I have gone the rubbing compound route, then the
&gt;touch up paint and then the spray bomb all of which help...still a paint
&gt;job is better for

A good paint job requires FULL stripping, FULL sanding down, followed by 
FULL primer application, another full sanding, plus a final skimming of 
bondo on the inevitible blemishes, followed by spot priming / sanding. Most 
average car paint places won't do this. Ideally you need a restorers care 
and attention, and $$$$, yes over $1K. A body shop that lightly sands down 
your paint to remove the oxide layer is also sanding the oven baked factory 
paint off the high 'rough' spots in the metal. All surfaces are 'rough' even 
if you and I can't feel it. If you don't fully primer these over, then the 
topcoat goes onto bare metal spots, albeit tiny, but all over your vehicle. 
The durable factory finish is disrupted, and you will get rust again, 2-5 
years later. Gimme a 15 year old original VW paint vehicle over one that is 
within 2 years of a new paint job. Have you checked about clearcoating the 
van? Newer cars are painted that way, but I have zero knowledge of pros and 
cons. 



&gt;other reasons. We are not however dedicated to MR Scheib or MAACO so if
&gt;anyone has any ideas on that account...
&gt;

I've never heard a good word about MAACO, ever. A smaller shop may let you 
do some prep work, stripping handles, grills, all lights, mirrors, bumpers, 
water inlets, antenna, and masking the poptop and the door seals. Tell'em 
you'll bring it in naked, needing only paint prep and the windows masking, 
see what price you get. Just don't get rear ended on the way there!
         Ask to see a finished car, look for orange peel, runs, thin spots 
etc. I had a guy paint one van without bending his knees, you could see 
through the paint down low by the rockers. He redid it under protest.
        You should lift the windshield seal rubber edges by packing 1/8&quot; 
yellow nylon rope underneath it to allow sanding/painting around the seal 
areas. Remove this carefully after the paint is hard. Works/looks way 
better. Mask off as little as you possibly can, body shops do it because it 
is way quicker/safer than strip down. It's a sure giveaway of the quality of 
the work.




&gt;My wife is determined to have the roof painted in the same ivory colour.
&gt;This I guess would be better than  a dark colour (if it must be painted);
&gt;although I am partial to the original white. The big concern is peeling
&gt;since paint does not stick as well to fibreglass.....
&gt;

Find a place that does Corvettes, they're FG, and come in any colour you want.


&gt;As for wallpaper Martha, we will keep my eyes open. My first choice would
&gt;be to cover over the existing paper rather than remove it....
&gt;

Don't know if this applies to Vanagons, but older Westys had a printed 
'woodgrain' surface that could be sanded down to a real (ply) surface of 
good quality, then refinished, with say Flecto Varathane Elite, clear or in 
a tint/shade of your choice.    tim s.
