&gt; &gt;&gt; So far, it has been the equal of all tasks and power demands

&gt; &gt;&gt; small hot plate/warmer, a light set, a CD player, and extension cords ... 
&gt; &gt;&gt; all at the same time).

&gt; &gt;&gt; We have tried alternative means to get the &quot;younger&quot; members to join us. 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Having sufficient electrical power for the &quot;toys&quot; seems to be the condition 
&gt; &gt;&gt; for us to keep the peace and get maximum participation. So now we just call 
&gt; &gt;&gt; it ...

&gt; &gt;Nothing ruins the peace and quiet of camping more often than generators. 
&gt; &gt;Noise that would be acceptable IMO in a city is unacceptable out in the 
&gt; &gt;woods.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Pete, I noticed that almost everything (except the microwave) that you 
&gt; &gt;used with the generator would be adaptable to 12 volts (without an 
&gt; &gt;inverter) or propane. A much friendlier alternative.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that almost everything could be left at home and not missed. Isn't 
&gt; that the idea of camping?

Come on, give the guy a break; he's explained that it's the only way he
can get his grandchildren to join along. Who ya gonna blame for that, 
generation X?
