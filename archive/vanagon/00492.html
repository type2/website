Subject:      vanagon towing capabilities

my owners manual (88 vanagon) says:

A trailer for your vehicle is limited to a typical class I trailer.
The maximum gross trailer weight and the tongue load must not exceed
the specifications listed in the Technical Information/Data section
of this manual.

Do not exceed the gross vehicle weight which is the weight of the
driver, passenger, luggage, trailer hitch and tongue weight of the
loaded trailer.
..............................................
Technical Information/Data - Specifications and Capacities
Weights
  ... are listed on the Safety Compliance Sticker on the left doorjamb.
The gross vehicle weight rating includes
the weight of the basic vehicle plus full fuel tank, oil and coolants,
plus max. load which combines passenger (150 pounds/68 kg per designated
seating position) and luggage weight.

Maximum permissible trailer weights
Braked trailer .................. 900 kg  2,000 lb
Unbraked trailer ................ 600 kg  1,320 lb
Tongue load .....................  75 kg    165 lb
...........................................................................

hmmmm. that's a lot higher than i had thought. i had 100 lb tongue weight and
600 lb trailer as the limits. maybe i was thinking of 600 lb trailer weight
without the luggage/load. must have been when i was pulling a motorcycle and
trailer (enduro racing) behind a 1971 bus. :)

hope it helps.
