Subject: Joel change the stats!

Hi Joel! I'm the proud owner for the first time in my life of a 1985go
Vanagon GL that is in mint conditions. The van was brought from
Massachusetts 5 years ago to Puerto Rico. The engine has only 6k miles
since the last rebuilt. The previous owner installed brand new heads
on it and I hope it will be trouble free for long time. I have heard
horrible stories of wasserboxers but I could'nt be free of the temptation
of buying it. So now I have a 1978 Westfalia (like new!!) and a 1985
Vanagon. Please include this one in your list and in addition include
a 1985 Panel Delivery Vanagon and a 1984 Vanagon GL with sunroof that
belongs to my friend Pucho (Puerto Rico's Vanagon guru). I'm very happy
with my new adquisition.

Saludos!
