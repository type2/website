Subject: Re: Installing Engine in 78 westie

Clay,

A few months ago I replaced the 2.0 liter engine and transmission in my '79
Transporter.  This engine is virtually identical to yours.

The engine and transmission went together effortlessly.  I tightened the
four engine mounting bolts while the engine &amp; tranny were still on the
wooden pallet. All the engine tin, intake manifold, injectors and heater
boxes were installed with the engine still on the pallet.

I removed and installed the engine and tranny as a single unit, which
simplified everything.  I had the rear wheels up on ramps and used a large,
orange 2.5 ton floor jack for the operation.  (The jack was on sale at Chief
Auto Parts for about $60.)  The balance point for the engine/tranny combo
was about at the junction between the two.  We used a small piece of soft
two-by-six to pad the jack from the engine/tranny.  I needed a helper for
about an hour each way to discuss stategy, help balance the engine/tranny
combo, line stuff up, hand me tools, etc.  When the engine/tranny were up
high enough, I screwed in the two long tranny bolts to the transmission
bearer and then put the engine bearer in place and its bolts.  Let the jack
down, task accomplished!

BTW, your buying a rebuilt long block from Mark Stephens was a good move.
That's where I got mine.  It was a stock rebuild, except for their &quot;zero
deck height&quot; technology, where they &quot;unshroud&quot; the combustion chambers for
more efficient burning of fuel.  Each rod/piston component/assembly was
balanced to within less than one gram of the others.  The volume of both
heads' combustion chambers was balanced as well.  They installed new
hydraulic lifters and a new cam.  The compression ratio was set at a low
8.0:1 so that I can run it on as low as 85 octane fuel (using their
unshrouding technology).  They included a new German clutch and pressure
plate, already installed.  They included a video of the new engine running
on a test stand, connected to oil pressure and temperature gauges.  My name
(misspelled) was displayed on a small chalkboard in the background.  A guy
talked throughout the procedure, telling about how they rebuilt the engine,
pointed to the oil pressure guage, which read a steady 60? psi at running
temperature.  He then removed all the spark plugs and ran a compression
check on all cylinders: 130 lbs on each.  He checked for oil leaks and
drained the oil (30w).  He then discussed how to break in the engine and
when to change the oil (at 300 miles), what kind (20w-50w) and so on.  I'm
saving the old engine (still running okay) to rebuild and keep as a spare
when I have the time.

The rebuilt tranny came from Transform, in CA.  The old tranny was still
fine, though.  I think that, given reasonable care and oil changes/topoffs,
Type II trannies have a service life of 250k miles or more.  Anyway, I'm
saving the old tranny as a spare.  They also sold me four &quot;racing&quot; CV
joints, German boots, etc.  The tranny came with a higher-geared fourth gear
for highway cruising.  It reduces RPMs by about 300 at 60 mph.

A local shop rebuilt the alternator and starter.  Actually, they just
cleaned them up, replaced the bushings and brushes and the solenoid.  Total
cost: $105. As it turned out, the alternator bushings were beginning to make
noise and weren't long for this world anyway.

The shifter ball socket had half an inch of solid, built-up dirt/grease
sludge in the bottom of it, which took scraping with a small screwdriver and
lots of solvent and steel wool to remove.  The nylon shift rod bushing was
gone and the shift rod connector at the junction of the shift rod and the
tranny got replaced, too.

I replaced all the fuel lines and the fuel filter.  For a final touch, I
replaced the points and condensor with a Pertronix Ignitor (Hall cell
technology).  Dwell is now a constant 59 degrees.  I should never even have
to think about timing or dwell again.  The rotor and distributor cap will
need replacing occasionally, though.  I think that I'm going to install
BOSCH platinum plugs before long; they're supposed to last 50k miles, or
something like that, before needing replacing.

I think that by spending some extra money and getting the job done right the
first time, you'll save yourself a lot of grief and hassle later.  A
properly-rebuilt and maintained Type IV engine should last 150k miles, minimum.

Have fun,

Cheese
