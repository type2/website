&gt; To answer the above questions, I offer the following:
&gt; 1)  Do not replace the sensor with the wrong type.  The heater is needed both
&gt; for quick warm up, and during extended idling.  Not having the heated sesor
&gt; can cause all sorts of wierdness during engine warm up.
Is there any easy way to test if the heater element is working? I 
assume it's like a glow plug which can be checked with a meter &lt;?&gt;
My '88 has recently started stalling when pushing clutch in during 
first few minutes of driving cold. Runs great otherwise. I expect 
it's that pesky throttle switch again, but with all this talk of O2 
sensors, I wanted to check mine...
