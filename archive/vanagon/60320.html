Subject: &quot;Eurovan Can't Get Hitched&quot;

We have a friend that needs a bike rack for a 1997 Eurovan for a cross
country trip.  He was told in Phoenix that his Eurovan could not have a
trailer hitch attached to it, so therefore they could not mount a bike rack.
 He is not a Vanagon list member, so we thought we would help him out.  Any
suggestions.  Thanks.
