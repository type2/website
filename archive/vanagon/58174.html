&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Just back from a weekend in Monterey.  Managed to miss the CCCs at Kelley
&gt; Park show in San Jose.
&gt; 
&gt; Returned to a lot of email, and somewhere along the line, spotted on one of
&gt; several classified lists of VWs and parts for sale on the web, a listing of
&gt; an aluminum running board, along with a name I thought might be familiar
&gt; from this list.  The ad specified ease of attachment thru jack mounts, etc.
&gt; i failed to bookmark it, and was unable to find it again despite hours of
&gt; searching.
&gt; 
&gt; is there someone here who has such a running board for sale?  if so, please
&gt; post me, as i could find it quite helpful, depending on cost.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; Gail

That would be me, and I still have it. The problem is that I haven't had
any time to figure out how much this thing costs. It is a high quality
part, aluminum. Does anyone else have one of these? Is it a VW part?
(looks &quot;official&quot;)
The reason I don't want it for my Westie is because it limits clearance
if I am in a off-road/camping situation. Also, at 32, I am still able to
get into the vehicle without the need of an extra step... :)
I will appreciate any suggestions as far as price for this. I do have a
couple of pictures of the running board that I would like to put in the
net, but have no idea how to do it. (I guess I need a scanner?)
Thank you.
Cris.
