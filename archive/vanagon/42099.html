&gt;&gt;  Hello volks, and the usual to the point. My question is about Vanagon front
&gt;&gt; spoilers. Will a spoiler from later Vanagon fit an 82 model? Would major
&gt;&gt; modifications need to be made to install the part? Thanks!

&gt;But does your vanagon really have good enough aerodynamics

 Of course not! That's the reason for wanting to install the part.

&gt; and go fast enough to cause lift?

 Yep, I put a Porsche 6 cyl engine and cruise at 110mph.  ;-)


 It is not a pleasant feeling when a strong gust hits the front and the
vehicle sways. I don't like this at all. Even the engineers at VW thought
about it and installed these suckers in later models. For looks? I don't
think so!

 MY VANAGON, sits higher in the front and I disagree about the box effect
due to the fact that above the grill it is quite sloped. The part I feel
that is missing is the spoiler. I wish to have better control of the vehicle
at higher speeds, 65mph and hopefully the spoiler will help in this matter.
If a gust hits the vehicle at the indicated speed, my hopes are that the
vehicle will lower and the drag will increase thus reducing the swaying.
Since I'm told that all I need is to drill a few holes, there wouldn't be
any real permanent damage to the vehicle which was another concern.

 I appreciate the answers and sent a message to one of you about selling me
the part. If anyone else wants to get rid of one of these animals, just send
me $19.98 and the spoiler. I will definitely appreciate it very much!   ;-)
