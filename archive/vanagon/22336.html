Subject: Noises off

There are two noises that I will try to relate to the list. Both have been
present in other VWs we have owned, so my concern relates mostly to
figuring out their cause. The engine is a 2litre Vanagon air-cooled; and I
suspect the noises relate to the air-cooled part.

The first noise sounds like bells being shaken very quickly and comes on
when the foot is taken from the accelerator and disappears when
accelerating. It is present at all speeds but especially going from high
revs to low revs (ie 3rd to 2nd). Any takers?

The second is a drone of a certain pitch, audible at a very specific rpm.
It is rpm related and not speed related but is most noticeable almost
exactly between the speeds of 56 and 58mph. It is not present below or
above these speeds. It is noticeable only if you listen for it and it
seems that this is the engine speed where a variety of things - exhaust,
firing etc - are in harmony with another. Any guesses?

I am sure if others with air-cooled engines listened they too would find
something similar to the above.

Thanks for any ideas.
David Carment
