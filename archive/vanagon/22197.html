Maniacs,

How are we supposed to be our usual helpful, kind, generous, sick, shot in
the dark VW experts if y'all don't state the YEAR?  

Like this exhaust manifold business, I assume this is a '71+ device, but if
it's not, I could help, sort of.  Sounds like the cylinders were shimmed out
to drop the compression, the whole long-block could be maybe .2&quot; wider than
stock.  Maybe it's stroked.

Like this &quot;oil sensor&quot; business, do you mean the 7 psi pressure switch on
all pre-'71 busses?  Or some other thingy?

Eug,
'71
