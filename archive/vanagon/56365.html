John,

I use the Thule 901(?) system.  It mounts on the gutters and clears the pop
top with on problem.  I carry 2 canoe's on top along with my bikes!!

When I get back home I will email the exact part numbers and the email
address of the list member I puchased it from. He was great to work with.

Thanks,

&gt; I own a 1984 Westfalia. It has the fiberglass pop-up top. I would like
&gt; to carry a canoe on the roof. Problem: I can't find any clamp-on roof
&gt; racks for this model. Anybody know where this item is available? Any
&gt; other ideas about how to carry a canoe on the roof?
&gt; 
&gt; 						   All comments will be appreciated,
