A belated Happy Holidays to all!!!

May the new year bring many safe and 
trouble free miles in your Type II.

Now, about this add from Joel dated 22 Dec 95:

&gt; 1985 Transporter, white, 2wd, 4spd, Audi rims, stereo, very clean, solid and
&gt;      original, can deliver anywhere, no collect calls.
&gt;      Peter (705) 673-5168
&gt;      &lt;picture shows a really clean-looking single-cab pickup truck, with Audi
&gt;      spoked rims

I was under the impression that only the Vanagon alloy wheels and
Mercedez alloys will fit the Vanagon. Does any one on the list have
Audi rims on their Vanagon?
