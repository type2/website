Subject: Paulchen rack... again

Well summer is coming and I still haven't found one of these at a price my
wife will approve of or for that matter any price (except the new ones that
is). Is there anyone who is willing to part with theirs for my best friend
Wally, the '84 Westy? I really like the one Ron Lussier has on his Westy,
the old style rack.

PS to Joel Walker, this is my new address. Formerly branard49_at_aol_dot_com.
Augusta, GA.
