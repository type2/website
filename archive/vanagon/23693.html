Subject: Alt. &amp; EGR lights

Back from travels, part 2.  The Vanagon is *wonderful* :) but has a
?problem? ?quirk? that's got me stumped.

The alternator &amp; EGR lights come on seemingly at will, sometimes for just a
flash, sometimes for a minute or more, and then they'll go out and stay out
for a couple of days.  This happens at highway speeds, low speeds, and in
between.  The alt. belt is new and doesn't appear to be slipping (it's tight
enuff) and any time I've started to try and check the elec. system the
lights are out, and stay out.  I put new points in it as part of a tune-up,
and the lights started to pop on about 400 miles later.

A related question: why, in the owner's manual does it tell you that running
the vehicle with the alt. belt slipping or off will &quot;seriously damage the
vehicle&quot;? In Die Frau I know that belt's for cooling, but in the '79 and the
air-cooled Vanagon what function does it have besides powering the alternator?

Thanx.
