&gt;canvas, etc. If anyone is interested the name of the place is Southlawn Auto
&gt;Recyclers, 15101 Southlawn Lane, Rockville, Md (310) 294-3322. The usual

You wouldn't consider pickup and delivery of this to somewhere say 800 miles 
east of you. I didn't think so. I'm go to move, I swear it. There is nothing 
near me, nothing! A world without VW parts yards is too cruel for me, so long..
