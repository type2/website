Hi All,

July 19 - Bug Blitz '97 - A VW affair on the Independence Square - 
Independence, Missouri (just outside Kansas City)

HotVW's will be providing magazine coverage.  Do you own the next feature
car?

This years Bug Blitz will be held at the historic Independence Square in
Independence, Missouri.  This is a GREAT site and the store owners are going
all out for us!  The new site has restrooms with running water (yeah!), lots
of antique stores for bored spouses, four restaurants, two ice cream parlors,
two ATM machines for those unexpected swap meet purchases, LOTS of parking,
trees for shade, and much more.  Camping sites with a huge pool less than two
miles away.  Several Bed and Breakfasts' within walking distance.

As always spectator admission is FREE and all models of VW's are welcome. 

For more information contact ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com or smokey_at_midusa_dot_net
or call 816-254-6815 or 913-384-1138 for details.
