Anyone have recommendations about a replacement tire jack?  The jack
that came with my bus is BUS-TED, errrr, broken.

One person recommended &quot;the hydraulic jack from Sears&quot;, but then, can
I use the original jack points?  If not, where would I place the jack?

Do all of you use the stock tire jack, or does anyone use a different
type?  What review would you give the various jacks?

On a related note, how can you tell (without jacking) whether the
original jack points are solid/usable?

Thanks,
Rodney
