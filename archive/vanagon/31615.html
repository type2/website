Subject: RE: My VW New Years Resolutions

10. Look at a VW van before buying it! (Bought two sight unseen in
1995). 

9. Keep from tipping the Syncro Westie onto its side (per last night's
dream - really!).

8. Write an engine transplant section for the FAQ/Archives.

7. Thank Bob Hoover for helping the rest of us keep our perspective.

6. Flame anyone who posts a possum joke. 

5. Organize event at Range Rover Test area for ALL buses, so everyone 
can explore off pavement limits with lots of friends around to pull 
errant listmembers out of any (vehicular) compromising situations.

4. Post Wannabus for Syncro Crewcab Tow Truck.

3. Compute total annual savings of subscribing to the list: 
do-it-yourself maintenance tips, midnight calls to Joel,
good deals from vendors, etc. 

2. Compute total annual cost of subscribing to the list: purchase of 
vehicles, activation of idle daydreams, dollars spent on &quot;once in a 
lifetime&quot; opportunities I would have been otherwise unaware of.

1. Ask Gerry to shift entire listmembership to digest mode,
to increase productivity of US workplace by 5%.


Happy New Year
