So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; The first noise sounds like bells being shaken very quickly and comes on
&gt; when the foot is taken from the accelerator and disappears when
&gt; accelerating. It is present at all speeds but especially going from high
&gt; revs to low revs (ie 3rd to 2nd). Any takers?

My guess is that it's probably the throw-out bearing (T.O.) and it's the
loose bearings you hear rattling as you release the accelerator.

&gt; 
&gt; The second is a drone of a certain pitch, audible at a very specific rpm.
&gt; It is rpm related and not speed related but is most noticeable almost
&gt; exactly between the speeds of 56 and 58mph. It is not present below or
&gt; above these speeds. It is noticeable only if you listen for it and it
&gt; seems that this is the engine speed where a variety of things - exhaust,
&gt; firing etc - are in harmony with another. Any guesses?

I'd suspect a sypathetic vibration being picked up by part of the exhaust
system.  You can check for slightly loose parts or parts that might rub
a little.  You can do the 'Click &amp; Clack' trick of running a hose down in
different areas and listening while you drive to find exactly where it's
coming from, but it's a little extreme.
