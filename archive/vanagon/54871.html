The black smoke is carbon particles.

This is the large particulate that everyone complains about with regards to diesel engines.

You might want to note that in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and many countries 
in Africa and South America, the majority of vehicles are diesel powered.  This is because 
these governments have regulations that help keep the price of diesel fuel down to 50%-60% 
of gas prices.

I, myself, firmly believe that if GM had not produced that crappy diesel V8 engine for cars, 
there would still be a good diesel market here.  Just look at VW's new direct injection 
engine.
