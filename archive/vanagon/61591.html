Subject: 95/97 Euro Winnies?
From: barto3_at_juno_dot_com (Bart F.I. Cannon)

	I am thinking of replacing my 87 Westy with a 95 or 97 Eurovan
Winnie.  I would appreciate any feedback on the merits of the
engines--the 5 cyl (95) or 6 cyl (97), of the Winnie components, of the
bad karma I'll engender by abandoning my 87 for a big buck rig, or
anything else I should consider before shelling out the big moolah

Thanks,

Bart.
