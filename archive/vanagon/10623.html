Gone Fishing - Answering the call of the wild
               with a roving studio apartment
by Dave Black
Road &amp; Track, July 1984

As the swift waters of the Trinity closed icily over my trashing form,
and even more chilling thought soaked in: I was nearly a thousand miles
from home, entirely alone, and no one on earth knew my exact location.
This was far from the most bouyant moment of my camping test of the
Waterboxer Vanagon.  It is well known, of course, that this lovely river
is perfect rainbow habitat, but at the moment I was not prone to linger.

With a mightly surge, I hoisted self, rod, saturated fishing vest and
sundries up and out of the stream, scrambled onto a rock and paused a
moment to drain while I contemplated (a) a few of my more recent sins,
(b) my good fortune at being unassailed by raucous hoots and howls of
laughter, and (c) the immediate implications of my plight.

Unfortunately, the last was not entirely laughable.  It included the
ominous signs of a rousing left-shin hematoma, which was already coming
up in several patriotic colors.  But far more emotionally agonizing at
the moment were the shattered remains of my treasured ultralight trout
wand, whose slim graphite fibers had snapped just above the cork.

That was the bad news.  The good news was that no more than 70 ft up the
bank stood a haven of blessed relief: Volkswagen's tried-and-true
moveable hospice, the Vanagon Wasserboxer mit Westfalia conversion.  It
radiated warmth and good cheer, and within an hour I was dry, bandaged,
composed, and even up to feeling out the modulus of my spare rod.  I
was truly at home in the wilderness.

The beginning of this affair had been rooted in purest logic.  The
Editor said let's just put one of those water-cooled, higher-powered
Vanagon camping rigs through a rigorous back-country examination. Let's
take it out where Mother Nature is in charge, out where the West begins,
where the brown bears amble and where the cougars are reputed to slink.
(Editors are known to talk that way during fifth-Wednesdays and on the
cusp of abrupt atmospheric changes.)

Fair enough: that's why Vanagons were born. To camp.  They aren't
widely applicable vehicles, you know. There isn't a Best-Van category
in most Concours d'Elegance, and you probably won't see a whole lot of
them hammering down the back straight at Riverside or slithering
sideways through Laguna Seca's Corkscrew.  No; these machines are for
living-in and for traveling-on ... and, of course, those became our
formal parameters.

Eventually the trip turned out to be a solo fishing/sightseeing/Vanagon-
driving jaunt that began in Orange County, deep in the southern end of
California, and wound all the way up to the top of this long, vertical
state.  It ran north along the eastern edge of the spectacular Sierra
range, edged over into a bit of Nevada, continued to within a few miles
of the Oregon border, and then headed home via the fast lanes.

One personal goal for the trip was to check out a couple of approaches
to the Trinity Alps Primitive Area and the marble Mountain Wilderness
for future backpacking reference.  The whole thing took almost a week
and a half, stretched about 2000 miles over hill, dale and dirt road,
and provided a lot of memories of streamside excitements and vast
scenic panoramas, plus a powerful desire to go right back and do the
whole thing again.  And we may as well record right here that we
gradually developed a lot of appreciation and respect for the Vanagon.

It was a delightful trip, and, of course, the performance of the camper
... both while traveling and while nestled among the pines ... was
central to the whole thing. First of all, it contributed by being
utterly dependable.  The mechanical parts, from tappets to top hardware,
from sliding-door latch to rear-hatch hydraulics, worked every time,
with smooth consistency. And its traveling manners were equally
impeccable; I administered a libation of 10W30 about halfway, but the
works needed no further attention during a route that started at sea
level, quickly climbed to and cruised around 5000-ft elevations for
much of the time, and cleared several 8500-ft summits.

The most extreme contrasts came on the first day. It began hot, along
the edge of the Mojave Desert in 95-plus temperatures, and ended that
night in a frosty campground at 8000 ft, where I spent most of the
night piling on every bit of fabric in the van, including the thick
window curtains.  From city streets to 6-lane freeways, then into
forests to dive into mud ruts and brush, and still it carried on.  The
water-cooled engine started up every time it got a chance and ran
smoothly all the way ... except for a couple of times on downgrades in
the big mountains when I, perhaps bemused by the gorgeous surroundings,
overran 2nd gear and the engine produced a polite shudder and cough by
way of remonstrance.

The ratios of the manual 4-speed were well suited to my varied demands,
with a range available for just about every purpose; from inching along
in 1st up some cleat marks where only a great Cat had gone before, to
zooming thriftily down the high road in 4th.  I did occasionally find
the gates stiff to enter, with a rubbery feel ... certainly a function
of the long reach back to the transaxle.  Mountain driving demands
considerable gear-changing, of course, to maintain the most productive
application of a modest torque peak (106 lb-ft at 2600 for the Wasser-
boxer right now, but watch this space) to the road grade of the moment.
It is frustrating indeed to find one of those gates barred, even
temporarily, between you and that one perfect ratio.

The driver's position in upright vehicles can perhaps be best
characterized as Van Vertical (as contrasted with Sportscar Supine),
and the position itself dictates a certain mental and physical approach
to the controls.  The steering wheel is gripped in a different style,
something like that of a bus driver; the shift lever is stirred from
above rather than being pushed and pulled, and the foot controls are
stomped downward rather than being toed (or heeled) forward.  This
approach can produce some pretty cavalier clutchwork, often to the
distress of the occupants and the embarrassment of those operators who
pride themselves on smooth-as-silk vehicle control.

Over a long haul even the modest faults of your conveyance, like those
of your traveling companions, come into hard focus, and the Vanagon has
a couple.  For one thing, I never quite fitted into the driver's seat
... especially way down there where it counts.  One of those little
sacroiliac pillows would have helped.  And though vision was superb to
the front, rear and sides, the location of the air conditioner (on the
ceiling above the rear deck) shortened my view out the back to about
200 ft.  The outside mirrors helped, but the center windshield mirror
should be relocated during AC installation to improve its rearward
range.

The power assisted front discs and rear drums gave smooth, consistent
braking, an absolute must in the mountains.  I did have a little trouble
with the parking brake, though.  The handbrake lever is located out of
sight and mind down on the floor between the seats, and unfortunately
the red brake-on light is hidden behind the thick rim of the steering
wheel.  I disgraced myself twice by leaving the handbrake on while
getting under way, and recommend the installation of a pop-out flag,
siren, or boatwhistle to prevent the problem.

There was some clutch grab, particularly when entering 3rd and 4th.
Careful pedal coordination smoothed it out to a degree, but never to
my full satisfaction.  Third and 4th gear are plenty long in the tooth,
so to speak, and are solid contributors to the Vanagon's respectable
EPA ratings of 19 urban mpg and 27 on the highway.  The gear ratios are
1.26:1 and 0.85:1 respectively, making 4th a solid overdrive range
nicely suited to the Wasserboxer's 22-percent power gain over its
windblown predecessor. The van takes comfortably to highway surfaces,
running quietly and easily, and I scored very near the EPA's figures
there.  Isolated mountain runs with plenty of grades and curves
averaged 21 mpg; not bad at all, considering the conditions.

The steering and the suspension of the Vanagon complement one another
nicely in most circumstances. Steering is rack and pinion, unassisted,
providing taut directional control together with the kind of surface
feedback that helps a serious driver feel his way smoothly down the
road.  The suspension is 4-wheel-independent, a matter of considerable
pride to VW as a design improvement over the Vanagon's forebears, which,
as legend has it, exhibited attention-riveting characteristics under
quartering headwind buffets and head-on truck blasts.

Fair enough. This trip convinced me that the Vanagon is a solid
traveling vehicle that can get you and your goods into the woods in
economical comfort.  But a lot of rigs can do that; what about its
specialty ... how is the Vanagon in the campground?  In a word, it is
superb.  The Westfalia camping setup is a combination of efficiency,
logical arrangement and designed-in comfort that provides continuing
pleasure to its inhabitants.  This is admittedly a judgement call,
slanted by the fact that I had all the facilities of a 4-sleeper to
myself, but other group trips have simply strengthened my opinion that
the Vanagon Westfalia is an outstanding choice for the traveling camper
who wants to stay this side of the maundering behemoths for reasons of
economy or maneuverability.  At just 179.9 in. long, the Vanagon can
handle the shortest camping space, and it is narrow enough to let even
a novice back up into that space with some style, grace and alacrity.

And what is so exceptional about this mountain marvel? Well, for
openers, just about everything is in exactly the right place. The pop-
up top, with its cot for two, is right there when you need it and out
of the way when you don't. The cabinets and all their odd-size chambers
and cubbies are superbly useful for everything from jackets and muddy
boots to pots and pans.

The kitchen unit is only about 6 by 3 ft in width and height, running
along the driver's side, but within that space it contains a 2-burner
propane stove; plenty of work surface; a stainless steel sink with
running water (via an electric pump); a refrigerator than can cool
itself with propane, 110-volt AC, or 12-volt DC out of the battery; and
enough cabinetry to carry the utensils, staples and special condiments
required for some fairly ambititous culinary productions.

The two front seats can be spun around to face the rear and are
provided with their own swingaway table, with another on board for the
rear bench seat. The Westfalia top can be popped before dining to give
walk-around head room over the center parlor ... or perhaps to permit
a bit of apres-dinner slow-dancing, if such is your pleasure.

Preparation for bed rest involves the following. Above: Top up, slide
bed support forward with foam mattress, put down bedclothes or sleeping
bags; sleep.  Below: Rock bench seat bottom up and back to unlock hatch,
lay seat flat, dress bed; retire. The heavy-cloth curtains are always
close at hand under the rear seat, are installed easily by a system of
snaps and hook rings, and effectively cover every window in the van.
Altogether it's a good system; the beds are quickly available when
needed, and repose comes early and deep in the great forests.

The trip's eeriest section was a made ride through velvet pitch-
darkness over the roller coaster highway of Lassen National Park:
35 miles without meeting a single car.  These things happen when you're
traveling alone. You lay out a nice, logical route ... Lassen was right
where I needed it to be, and besides I think the place is wonderful ...
but then you see some nice water, get involved with a few trout; and
suddenly you're three hours late. &quot;Mind-boggling&quot; is a cheaped-out
phrase these days ... everybody's doint it ... but there's no better
description of that run.

Think of this: You slip guiltily through a deserted guard station, then
suddenly all your senses are filled to bursting.  The van is surrounded
by gusts of hot steam and sulphurous billowings: you stop, open the
window for some fresh air, and hear the frothing of superheated waters
together with dire subterranean mutterings; the headlights slashing
around every curve pick out sets of bright eyes deep in the trees.
Finally you are forced to stop: A sleek doe is walking her dappled fawn
across the highway ahea. She glances up once into your headlights, then
both are gone.  And you understand something very important: this is
their time and place ... you are the intruder.

It was a weird and wonderful run: I wouldn't have missed it for the
world. And I can't think of a better vehicle for it than the Vanagon,
with that wide-open visibility, quiet rear-engine running, quick
steering and stable handling for its size, and the facilities to let me
just pull over at any time and sleep out the night in safety and
comfort. Come to think of it, that's a fair description of the van's
performance during the whole trip.

And how are my snapped trout stick and savaged shin coming along?
Just fine, thanks. A few nights of innovative epoxying handled the rod,
and X-rays showed that the hematoma's signs of violence were far more
graphic than vital. Both problems will soon slip into the old memory
bag to join all my other recollections of that long, solitary journey
through the mountains; a trip made delightful ... perhaps even made
possible ... by the Vanagon Wasserboxer.
