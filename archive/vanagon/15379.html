Subject:       Re: Temperature sensor II in '77



&gt; Has anyone had similar symptoms with a faulty sensor or is there something I
&gt; am overlooking?

I had problems with the sensor in my '78 several years back. The 
engine would be running ok for a while and then would not idle at a 
constant rpm at all. I put my multimeter on the lead from the sensor 
when it was doing this, and the voltage was jumping all over, 
indicating that the sensor was intermittent. Replacing the sensor 
fixed the problem. 

My sensor was in a hole in the tin so I could get a deep socket on 
it. Unfortunately, when I removed the old one, it took some of the 
aluminum threads with it. I had to clean up the threads with a tap 
and put the new sensor in gently with some loctite. Worked good.
