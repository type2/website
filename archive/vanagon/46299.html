Subject: 91 Vanagon starting problem

My 91 GL has had a starting problem I'm wondering if any of you can solve.
This has gone on in varying degrees for the last three years.  It seems to
happen after the engine has been turned off for a short time.  Then when I
turn the key to start it there is either:

1. Nothing, just a click when I turn the key.  After three or four tries it
will start fine.

2. Turns over slowly like the battery is bad.  After a couple of tries it
will start fine.

The battery is new and the starter is new.  All connections have been
checked and appear to be OK.  Any thoughts?????

Thanks.  I will be signing off the list for a couple weeks starting 7/11
while I'm away.  Feel free to e-mail me directly at:
