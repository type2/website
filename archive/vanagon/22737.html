&gt;
&gt;I think I've stared at the bus long enough.  I think I can see it now, the
&gt;way she will be when I'm finished with her.
&gt;I'm about to embark upon a ground-up restoration of a 1977 Westfalia that
&gt;will be extremely comprehensive including an engine overhaul, some body
&gt;work, surface rust removal (and whatever lurks beneath the window rubber),
&gt;and perhaps even paint, which brings me to the one last decision to make
&gt;before I dive in.  Citibank (heh heh- the fools) just sent me, as planned,
&gt;a nice new VISA card with a healthy  limit, which is yet more evidence of
&gt;the benefits of marrying a woman with good credit.  So:  should I invest
&gt;the $600-$700 for a decent compressor and air tools?

&gt;Thus my first appeal to the list.  For those who have air, do you like it?
&gt;Is there anyone out there who invested in air and later wished that they
&gt;hadn't?  Is there anything out there I should avoid?  Thanks in advance for
&gt;your feedback.
&gt;Peter.

Peter, look for a used compressor, 3-5 hp, 20-25 gal tank, this would be
minimum. In finding one used, you might get some used tools with it. The air
tools are a lot less expensive that electric, they don't weigh as much and
folks don't tend to steal them as often. You can use air for lots of
different things, blowing out the shop, filling up tires, powering air tools,
etc. I've got an air drill, air rachet, die grinders (2), impact wrench and a
few other specialty tools. Changing tires is great with the impact wrench. I
picked up a few hundred feet on air hose and I can sandblast outside (did my
house/foundation this summer) and when I do my roof, I will rent an air
nailer. Just having compressed air to blow/clean things is worth the price of
the compressor.
