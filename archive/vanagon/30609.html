Subject: RE: /f Top speed


&gt;Then there are the Steve Mahers of the world who can replace the FPS with
&gt;MPH and still have some pedal left.


The V6anagon is built for maneuverability (fore-and-aft as well as
side-to-side), not for speed, Joe. Nicest thing is, not having to
worry about whether I'm pushing it too hard, as I constantly worry
about with my '71.

Fact is, it's no faster than a typical V6 minivan. Slower, in fact,
since the tranny is geared fairly low for the original engine. But
when you say &quot;go&quot;, it says &quot;How fast?&quot;, instead of &quot;Who, me?&quot;. A nice
change.   :^)
