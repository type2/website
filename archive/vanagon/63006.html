&lt;&lt; I just got another set of VW Vanagon alloy wheels for sale.  If anyone is
 interested let me know.  The price is $650 plus shipping for a set of four
 which includes the small hub caps in the center and the special lugs and
 nuts. the wheels are located in Los Angeles but UPS can ship anywhere and I
 can deliver them to San Francisco
  &gt;&gt;

for that price, you should throw in the 5th one (the spare)....
don't you think?
