&gt; sounds like it is a good deal assuming the &quot;no rust&quot; part is 
&gt; true, you might bear in mind that this is the last year for

I've owned both years. The '71 is definitely a quicker stopper, but the 
'70 has it's advantages too, including a little simpler wiring scheme, 
and a simpler (though perhaps not as feature laden) carb. I'd quickly 
choose a '70 with no rust over my '71 with cancer...as I'm sure most list 
members would. But then, all things being equal, I agree with many others 
that '71 was the best year for the VW bus. ...just an opinion; not 
flamebait! 8) Joe
