&gt;Tim Smith was nice enough to recommend the Yokohama Y370G D rated tires.
Says that he has good luck with them on his '87 Syncro. He also mentioned
that they are a 195/70/14 size. I checked with the various local tire
dealers and with the Yokohama 1-800-366-TIRE (8473) number and was told that
the above described tire DOES NOT EXIST! The Y370g is only available in
195/70/13 or 205/70/14. Will the 205s be too much? Harry Yates,
hyates_at_bcit.bc_dot_ca, mentions the Yokos Y370 LT but didn't give vitals on
specific size (eg 195 vs 185 etc.)
Now the dealer is trying to shove me into a Yoko Y356 tire which is &quot;C&quot;
rated passenger tire.
Is this the hassle factor that Sami D was eluding to earlier in his search
of the Michellin XZX 185/70 SR 14&quot;s?  Weird, huh? Sheesh, all I want is some
danged tires!!! AAARRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!
