Subject: Re: Anyone Install a Drain Plug on a Vanagon Auto-Tranny

I can't imagine why you would want to install the drain plug.  You don't
need to change the fluid that often.  When you change the fluid, it is a
good idea to change the filter.  You may introduce metal particles into the
transmission in this operation.  Dropping the pan is not that hard
considering you only have to do it every 60k miles.

&gt;ATF pan looks it was designed for a drain plug on some other
&gt;application. I wish to know if there is enough metal there to accept the
&gt;threads necessary for a drain plug. Anyone done this? Anyone have a any
&gt;data on the thickness of the boss on the ATF pan? Any data and feedback
&gt;appreciated.
