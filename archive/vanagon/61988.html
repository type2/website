Subject: Block Heaters and other stuff

Does anyone have any experience ($$$ or other) installing a block
heater in a vanagon?  I'm interested in expense and difficulty.  Is
there some sort of kit available?

Also, I saw a solar panel attached to the top of a vanagon the 
other day.  Would this be used for battery charging or maybe just
aux power for toys?  Any thoughts on uses, $$$ for solar panels?

And then a random question, does anyone know of a good product for
cleaning / protecting canvas?

Thanks,
Stephen Jones
