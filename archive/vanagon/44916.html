Subject: Noisy Lifters on new Heads (86Westy)?

Hi, I'm still fiddling (probably out of paranoia) with worries on my 
new engine wasserboxer. AFTER replacing the '86 Westy's 2.1 engine last 
year, the local Dallas dealership needed to replace both heads last 
month because of water leaks. The new head work was under warrenty, but 
now I'm hearing a ticking noise at idle. It's loudest when first 
starting up, after sitting a little while. The dealership looked at it 
and then readjusted the lifters and replaced the ones on the driver's 
side. The noise is still there. Should I be concerned?? It runs great 
except for this noise. I don't beleive it used to make this noise 
before the heads were replaced.

Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. Not only the cause, 
but what you think I should tell the dealer (if necessary).

 Thanks!  Vance
