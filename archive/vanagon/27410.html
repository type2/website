 &gt;We have a 1973 trasnsmission in one of our vans and a VDO tach
&gt;
&gt;80 mph = 4,000 rpm.
&gt;75 mph = 3,750 rpm.
&gt;70 mph = 3,500 rpm.
&gt;65 mph = 3,250 rpm.
&gt;etc.
&gt;
&gt;As you can see, the tach reading is 50 times the mph.

Off the topic of baywindows for a sec and onto vanagons for just a second,
when doing like 70 mph, my tach reads around 4000 rpm.  I noticed that when
i do that same speed in another car i used to drive it was around 2500, this
difference is due to the differences in the transmissions, correct?  So then
im thinking (buzz, crackle..) hmmm my vanagon 4 cylinder is rotating twice
as fast as my car's 6 cyl. engine, and therefore it will get twice the wear,
and half the life, all else equal.  So, the vanagon transmission is
&quot;killing&quot; our engines??  There was a 5 speed offered in germany i believe
the archive road and track thingie said... hmmm.. maybe if i won the lottery. :)
