&gt; Peter Egan's changed a lot, too. He had to grow up like all of us. He used
&gt; to write for Cycle World, back when they were owned by the same folks that
&gt; owned R&amp;T. I used to read that magazine religiously, too, until I got out
&gt; of bikes. It was good to see Egan come over to R&amp;T. I think he's one of the
&gt; best writers around.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;        Maybe there should be term limits for autmotive journalists?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I don't know. R&amp;T used to have a bunch of good writers--Rob Walker on
&gt; F1, Henry Manny III (who was funny on just about anything) are the first
&gt; that come to mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Peter Egan is still writing for Cycle World, but I tend to agree Bill about
 Peter's changes over the years - he's been writing lately about the ZX-11 he   
 bought and how he never rides his Norton or BMW anymore because they don't 
 deliver the adrenoline rush of the ZX-11. Sounds to me like a guy whose 
 middle age has got him worried about getting it up. Hard to believe it's the
 same guy who used to drive a Lotus Super Seven.

 Kevin Cameron is writing for Cycle World now and he just gets better and 
 better. Great article in this months issue on the 250cc six cylinder Honda
 GP bike that Mike Hailwood rode in the mid-sixties.

 Henry Manney III is my favorite automotive writer of all time. What a  
 fantastic sense of humor. His account of driving across the United States
 in a Porsche 904 was priceless - I don't think you could find a journalist
 today with the huevos to even try that - and Manney took his wife! (or maybe
 she took him?)
