Well, I spoke too soon.  Soon after I sent out the &quot;where are the Friday
sillies?&quot; mail I was dragged into a whole bunch of stuff, only to manage
to read my mail now...  Looks like the list was pretty much its usual self
after all, and my apologies to Joel for not contributing to the silliness...

But, as my wife often says, who'd want silliness from a boring engineer
anyway???? 


Have a nice weekend volks...
your (only slightly) imaginationally challenged engineer,
Cetin,
