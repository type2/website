Subject: Re: EV Transmission Preference

Hi Matt:

I have a 1995 EV-Winnebago with the 5-speed.  For my money,
it's the best choice by far.  It has more pep, and better
fuel economy.  The broad torque range of the Audi engine
means very little &quot;rowing&quot; - I often drive around town in
5th without lugging.

(And I have 16 gears on my Moulton ;{&gt;   )
