Subject: Owner's Manual from J.C.Whitney


Can someone tell me if the Vanagon owner's manual they
have in the J.C.Whitney catalog is good? It's $70 and
I have to pay a bundle in shipping charges, so I don't
want to be dissapointed.

Please e-mail me directly (as well as post to the list if
you want) because I've had to unsubscribe due to lack
of time.

Thanks.
