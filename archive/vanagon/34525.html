With apologies to Neil Young:
	I've been lookin' for a bus
	but I haven't found her yet
	She'll be nothing like I picture her to be
	In the cabin I'll discover another reason why
	I want to live and get the best bus that I see...

	Anyway, went to look at a '79 westy today, priced fairly and in
	overall pretty darn good shape.  If I had gotten there when I
	said I would be then today I would have a bus but, I had to dig
	my car out of the snow which took more time than I expected, I
	arrived an hour late and there were already other people
	crawling around it.  Turns out these other people were also
	serious about buying so we did the silent bid thing and they
	outbid me by about $125.  Oh well.  I guess I'm still looking...

	Anybody got a bus they don't want no more????

	David Finet, you still got one?  I don't have to wait until
	summer any more.

	Wanting a bus,
	Sean
