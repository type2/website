Subject:       Congratulate me on my score!

Well friends,

Monday a friend and I discovered a '65 Kombi in a field south of my 
home about 1/2 hour.  We tracked down the owner, and guess what?

I'm the proud owner of a '65 Kombi!

Price:  $150

Has a 1500 single in it!  Wow.  The body is in fair condition.  Usual 
rot out on the rocker panels.  It's a walk-though and has the seats!  
Cool, eh.

Problem:  Tranny is locked up!

Hehe.  If the frame is really bad (I've not been able to get under it 
yet) I'll just part it out.  There's easy more than $150 of parts in 
it.  The seats alone are worth more than that out here!

So now I am:

'57 23-Window Deluxe 1776cc
'65 Kombi
