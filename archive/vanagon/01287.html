Subject: Re: loose wipers

I had the same problem with loose wiper arms on my 71 bus. I took the wiper
assembly out of the bus and replaced the worn shaft with a good used one I
pulled out of the wrecking yard. It now works great! 
It is not a difficult job and the entire procedure is covered pretty well in
the Bentley manual. A new shaft may even be still available from VW, though I
didn't check that possibility out when I fixed mine.
