Subject: Re: Foglight Wiring &amp; Aux Bat...

&gt;1.1 So where did you install your RV battery?

Mine is behind the rear driver's. Some Vanagons show a little reserve battery
installed to the left of the engine compartment.

&gt;1.2 And of course where did you install the isolator and just how is the
net.wisdom.best
   way to wire the critter.                

DO NOT USE A DUAL BATTERY ISOLATOR ON A VW BUS! Sorry to shout but 
this point seems like it needs repeating as the isolator thing keeps rearing
its head
up. The reason is that a VW alternator doesn't put out as much voltage as an 
American alternator and you therefore shouldn't make it fight its way through

the voltage drop that an dual battery isolator entails (typically 1 volt).
You can do it, 
but it will take a long time to recharge your batteries. It is much smarter
and cleaner 
to use high current 12 volt operated relays instead.

&gt;1.3 Where to break the wiring to the rear interior light and the Dometic so
as to 
    run the accessories off the RV battery rather than the main starting
battery.
    Physically, not electricaldiagrammarly.

Behind/Under the front drivers seat.

&gt;1.4 Did you need a remote Voltage Regulator Sensing device?

Huh?

&gt;1.5 Any other hints, kinks, tips, catastrophy avoidances, horror stories
related to 
    the aux pwr system.

I suggest people buy their heavy duty wiring supplies from Wrangler Power
Products as soon as they get their new catalog printed. They are at PO Box
12109 Prescott, AZ 86304 800-962-2616/602-717-1771. Their catalog was one of
the greatest things for this this but they have been out of print for almost
a year!

&gt;I have a Coleman LPG portable 4000btu Catalytic heater.  Nice unit, holds two
 bottles
&gt;of 16.4oz LPG has flameout protection and is free standing.  I can post the
model if
&gt;you like but I'm not sure they're still available.  Mine was a GS item for
$25.

I use a similar coleman.

&gt;Anyone own a MSDS Carrera six conversion?  How'd you heat your &quot;cab&quot;  Oil
cooler
&gt;ducting or ??

MSDS people all freezing to death! 

MSDS dude himself uses 12 volt heater. Hah! 

Still freeze to death, and fry alternator. Hah!
