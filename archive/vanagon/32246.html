&gt;
&gt;In addition, I don't think the news of the higher limits has filtered 
&gt;down to all drivers yet, even though the new signs are up and the news 
&gt;stations run a story on it just about every night.  This seems
&gt;to be most prevalent with the, shall we say, &quot;older generation&quot;
&gt;of driver's, the ones who still think you're lungs will collapse
&gt;at speeds above 50mph (people really use to think that!)
&gt;

    A historical note: Speedlimits in California are *now* being restored 
    to what they used to be prior to the enactment of the NMSL in 1974. 

    There are plenty of us &quot;older generation&quot; folks who were used to blasting 
    up and down I-5 at ~100 or more in the old days until the NMSL made this 
    a financiAlly disasterous practice.

    California's basic speed limit was max 65 except where  otherwise posted.

    Those of us with VW buses were used to 70mph on the freeways in those days.
    The Type IV 1.7L pancake in my '73 camper was a Godsend, unfortunately
    the NMSL cut down on our range by extending the amount of time it took 
    to get places in the West.

    Old enough to remember the GoodOldDays.
