Dan:
Check the idle position switch. It is located under the throttle body.
Test can be done several ways with engine off. I have found them to be
bad  if they don't t click when activated. Have someone slowly depress
accelerator pedal while you listening engine compartment. As the linkage
starts to move you should hear the switch click. If you really want to be
sure use a VOM. I'll bethca a doughnut that's the problem!
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely
