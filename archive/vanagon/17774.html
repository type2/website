&gt; We were discussing this one over on the corrado list and after
&gt; a few calls to Crutchfield and one guy who bought it, the concensus
&gt; seemed to be you just can't get sufficient bass from such a small
&gt; driver, though it is a real slick idea for a small hatch, but since
&gt; you still got to mount the amp somewhere and the displaced jack in
&gt; a Corrado, didn't seem much better than getting a small (6.5&quot;) bazooka
&gt; with a built in amp, plus on a Bus who cares anyway? Plenty o room
&gt; for anything.

You would think there is plenty of room for anything, huh?  But I'll be
durned if I can't think of a good place to put a subwoofer in my bus.
It won't fit behind the seats, and there is nowhere underneath the
seats to put it either.  The only place I can think of would be up
under the dash, but I don't think it would fit well either.  Has anyone
actually installed one of those small tube subwoofers in a breadloaf?
Where did you put it?

Thanks,
