Subject: Re: optimal warmup time?

&gt;
&gt;I think we started this thread once, but I can't remember the
&gt;concensus, due to my alzheimers-senility, or whatever that disease
&gt;was I had.  Anyway, how long should I warm up my car?
&gt;
&gt;........................................................................

Muir suggested that a VW should be warmed up the length of time that it
takes you to roll a cigarette of your favorite tobacco! (Really). I prefer
to warm it up the length of time that it might take someone else to roll a
cigarette of THEIR favorite tobacco. ;)
