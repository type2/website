Subject: CONVERTING GERMAN DRIVER'S LICENCE

This is somewhat Bus-related, in that it will allow my wife to legally
drive a vanagon (we're still looking for one, BTW).

The Problem:  The province of Ontario doesn't recognise German driver's
licences, so my wife (who recently moved here) will have to go through a
series of tests and then STILL only have a probationary licence for two
years in spite of 8 years driving experience on German roads and the
Autobahn.

The Solution?: Ontario WILL automatically &quot;convert&quot; any other Canadian
province's or US state's driver's licence.  Soooo, if we just found another
province or state that'll convert her licence automatically, we can get
that licence and then convert IT into the Ontario licence we ultimately
need.

It might seem like a lot of running around, but we're planning a roaming
vacation this spring (destination not yet determined), so it could be an
easy solution.  So please email us any details and relevant phone
numbers/addresses if your state/province will convert her licence.

Vielen Dank!
