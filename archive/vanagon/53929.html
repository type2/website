Subject: Re: JCWhipme where are you?

Larry,

J.C. Whitney is an automotive mail order business based out of Chicago.  They
can be reached by phone at 312-431-6200. They'll send a catalog to you for free.
  I have been ordering parts from them since my early mispent youth with MG's
and Austin Healys, except I find their quality level is inconsistent. You place
your order and you takes your chances. 

Good luck,

Charles
