on the 80 vanagon, i was able to just put the dual sender down into the hole
in the sheet metal where the old sender had been. but i do recall that it was
a real pain. we had to heat-bend (with a torch) a cheap wrench to get it to

&gt;looks a LITTLE weird because it is too deep to fit flush.  Other ideas?

i had a little two-gauge holder that i mounted right over the ashtray hole
(since i never used the ashtray) and ran the wires up to the gauges through
there. kept it from moving around with velcro strips.
