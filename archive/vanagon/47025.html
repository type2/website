Subject: brakes again

Hi everyone,

I hate to be a pain with this brake problem, but I can't afford to take my
westy to a shop nor do I want to buy parts that I may not need (master
cylinder??) Let me describe the problem with my 83 WB Westy.(a more
detailed description than yesterday) When I step on the brakes and hold it
the pedal sinks to the floor. It happens both with the engine running and
with it off. I can stop but usually it requires a double pump. The pedal
feels mushy. When I give it a good pump it feels firm and then gets soft
and the pedal sinks. About a month ago I changed the master and slave
cylinder on the clutch, but I did NOT bleed the brakes.
  I am wondering if anyone can tell from this description if it is air in
the lines or do I need a master cylinder. I asked yesterday and some people
were good enough to reply with suggestions. From the advice that I got it
could be the master cylinder, the booster, or just air in the lines. I
would like to replace the master cylinder before bleeding if it is suspect.
Although, if this sounds like a classic case of air in the lines that would
save me a bunch of dollars. I don't have a clue so any info would be
greatly appreciated. Should I just replace the master cylinder and bleed?
or just bleed? I suppose that the master cylinder wouldn't be that much $
but I suspect that the booster will be tons of cash ( I hope its not
that!). Thanks again.

dave
