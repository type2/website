Subject: Re: 'roo bars? 

Dworkin,

A very good quality 'roo bar is made here in Orange. A ball park figure 
for a Vanagon (called a Caravelle in Australia) is $A750.

I realise that your VW is a '60s model but it would cost about the same I 
think. Of course, lower quality bar equals lower prices. I think the bar 
I got a price on would be top of the range

I concede your point about the city traffic, psychological-warfare 
aspects of a 'roo bar. Most 4WDs sold in Australia have them and most 
4WDs sold in the city don't get dirty, therefore the bars must be to 
protect the vehicle.
