&gt; Why do I persist in playing with a
&gt; nearly 25 year old hulk while others zip around in their trouble-free
&gt; Geos or Datsuns?  Because I secretly love to work on my Bus and it is
&gt; the coolest form of transportation known.  OK, I know, I'm one sick puppy.

Haha!  So true.  Even if it is off topic a bit, a friend and I are 
involved in a serious debate about the reliability of some generic 
little japanese box, or the ultimate coolness of a transporter.  He 
has a '64 and keeps whining about having to fix it.  I tell him he's 
not worthy of it... ;-P
