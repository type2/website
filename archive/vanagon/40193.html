Subject: more missing

 
	Alright, thanks to everyone who gave me
the advice with my missingness.
 
	I figured out the cause of the missing as severly fouled
plugs. I replaced the oil and plugs and the problem went away for
exactly the amount of time it took for the engine to foul
them again.
 
	HEre is my thinking on the whole deal.
1) There is gas in the oil, therefor they are gas fouled.
2) The gas has to be coming from my fuel rejection system.
3) Its either my cold start valve or my injectors.
4) Becuase all 4 foul out, its probably my cold start valve.
5) I am going to bypass the valve, which is easier than pulling
it to check it, and see what happens
6) I don't need this hassle 2 weeks before finals.
 
	Can anyone think og anything I missed?

Many thanks,
MAtt
