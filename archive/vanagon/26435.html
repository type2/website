Subject:       Re: Need r. bumper splash pans for '67 Bus

&gt; The typical response was from M. White in Utah (the Humor state). Mike's
&gt; response was the old ROTFL. Mike was too much of a gentleman to include the &quot;AO&quot;

You know that state obscenity commission would be _RIGHT_ON_MY_... 
well, you know.

&gt; BTW: Does anyone need (want to buy) a perfectly good set of powder coated
&gt; (60% gloss black) early splash pans? =)

You said they are for the early fluted bumpers?  Were they Westphalia 
only parts?

BTW!  Your floor mat is just waiting for me to figure out what to 
ship it in!  I'll have to find a big box.  Was there anything else 
you wanted besides that and a big kiss?
