&gt; Rob,
&gt;  I hope I am not experiencing the same problem you are.  Bus Depot
&gt; double shipped me an order of which I had to pay for because it was
&gt; COD.  One potable water pump and starter solenoid cost me over $120.   I
&gt; was promised a refund check, but I have yet to receive it.  I will say
&gt; that this has jaded my opinion of the Bus Depot. I got &quot;the check is in
&gt; the mail&quot; response when I called in.     Waiting to see.

Below is a copy of my response to Ken, with his mailing address deleted for
privacy reasons:

Ken,
I sent the refund check when I said I did.  However it just arrived back in
my mailbox on Friday, labeled &quot;return to sender, no such street address.&quot; 
Odd, because I sent it to exactly the same address that I sent the
merchandise to (xxxx xxxxxxxx Rd. Tazewell TN 37879).  Do you have a
different address that you would like it sent to?  I will send the whole
envelope, &quot;return to sender&quot; label, postmark, and all, to the address that
you specify.
