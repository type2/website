Provided the bearing doesn't come into contact with solvents or gasoline
and the contact surface is still nice and smooth, they usually last a
long, long time.  In over 35 years, I've seen 'em last as long as over
100 to 150K.  However, the rule of experienced thumb is to replace it
when replacing that worn-out clutch.  Nothing frustrates a person more
than to go through the whole process of replacing the clutch and not the
TO bearing only to have it make noise the next day while driving.  Even
more so with what you have to go thru to pulling the engine on any 72-91
Bus/Vanagon.  Do it right the FIRST time.

And always use a genuine F&amp;S TO Bearing - stay away from the Brazilian
variety.

my two cents worth  :-)
