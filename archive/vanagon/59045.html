&lt;&lt; I'm sort of toying with this idea too.  Although I don't have any fears
 about driving my '91 around the US and Canada, I'd prefer an air-cooled
 beater for Mexico.  This is mostly because in Mexico, I wouldn't want
 to have to deal with any kind of cooling system mishap.  There air
 cooled systems are pretty self reliant and you don't have to carry
 extra coolant for them.  The worst scenario for the water-cooled 
 vans is loosing all of your coolant.  That would mean having to
 carry at least 3 jugs extra gallon jugs just for that possibility.
 That's too much extra weight and bulk for me.

get a '68-'71 Westy.  The 2 liter FI type4 engined Vanagons can be as much of
a nightmare as the wasserboxers when you break down in the middle of nowhere
in Central/South America. Parts are easy to get and plentiful for the
'68-'71's in Mexico.
