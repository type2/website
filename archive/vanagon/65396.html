Subject:      Re: Insuring a Camper

Wow! This is really odd! I just got back from a 5 hr. meeting with my
insurance broker trying to insure my '90 Westy (wound up not getting it
done - had to get back to work!). We were having trouble because the
vehicle is a conversion camper and therefore they had no way of assessing
the vehicle worth.

Has anyone else had this problem in Calif? Any recommendations for
insurance carries in the San Francisco Bay Area?

Thanks!

Chris

&gt;I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be insured
&gt;as an RV (at least with State Farm).  My insurance on the '84 Westy is
&gt;about half of what it is for my '86 Jetta.  Many years ago, in
&gt;California, the requirements for RV insurance were that it had to have a
&gt;bed, a sink, and a stove.  Here in North Carolina, the agent just
&gt;processed the RV application without telling me the details.
