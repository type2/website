&gt; Hi all:   Has anyone had a problem with power locks as follows? If I
&gt; unlock the drivers door with a key, the lock opens then quickly relocks.
&gt; If I get the door open while unlocked the lock will just go up and down 
&gt; until I close the door then it locks and stays. If I pull both front
&gt; door locks up at the same time, they will stay unlocked (and unlock the
&gt; rear doors as well) until one of them gets pushed down then they all
&gt; lock and it acts as I first described. The locks worked well until all
&gt; at once they started acting this way. I havn't a clue. Thought I'd ask
&gt; the list before I started pulling my hair out trying to figure out what
&gt; It's doing. Thanks

Hi Todd,

This exact scenerio happened to my father-in-laws van.  It turned out to be a 
buggered power lock motor on the driver door.  He needed a new one.  One 
question, does this same behavior happen when you open the passenger door 
first???  If it doesn't, then it is the motor for sure.  This is the third time 
I have heard of this happening so I wonder if there was a bad run on motors!!!

Good Luck
Tony
