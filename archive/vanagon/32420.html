&gt; Looks like I'll need to replace the struts which looks easy enough on paper,
&gt; Haynes manual. The local bug/bus man wants &quot;just under $100&quot; for the job and
&gt; suggests not doing it myself for fear of having the coil spring knock the
&gt; breath outta me. Is this a legitamate concern or should I go rent a compressor

  My best advice is not do it yourself.  The amount of energy stored in
those springs is massive and it can be a quite traumatic experience to
have a tool fail.  Struts are expensive but repairs to your body are much
more expensive.  My father in law was a GM mechanic and do it yourselfer
extrordinaire for 20 years and HE takes his struts to a shop to have them
replaced.
