SNIP

&gt;Mid-life crisis? How rude! Why is it... that... just when you figure
&gt;out that it's OK to do something that pleases you, and you just so
&gt;happen to be 46... that some people think you're going through some
&gt;sort of crisis? I believe that creating &quot;Her Majesty&quot; was a
&gt;celebration... not a crisis!

Hey Kathy... You Go Girl!

(No political incorrectness intended - for clarity watch the TV comedy &quot;Martin&quot;)

Is &quot;Her Majesty&quot; on a web site for the rest of us to get worked up over?

A great pox on all those superfluous naysayers you have encountered for
whom the life ran out before the years did.

Jim
