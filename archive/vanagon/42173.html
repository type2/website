Subject: Minnesota VW Show

The Twin Cities Volkswagen Club presents the 10th Annual Bug-In, Minnesota's
largest Volkswagen event.  It will be at West Side VW at Highway 100 and
Cedar Lake Road in Saint Louis Park, MN.  It will be 9 June from 9:00 am to
3:00 pm (had to suppress the urge to put 0900 to 1500).  All VW's are welcome
(the Syncro will be there), dash plaques for the first 250 cars, huge swap
meet, dealer booths, used car corral, trophies by people's choice, food &amp;
beverages, and prizes &amp; games.  Hope the ones in the area can make it!  I
should be one of the ones at the gate.

Brad
'72 Westy
'87 Syncro GL

P.S.
This is going to the Vanagon list and the AOL VW Underground so some may get
this twice.
