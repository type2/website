Subject: Battery Removal - '87 Camper

.... there must be an easier way!!!!   Because the base for the captain's
seat is so far back, the only way I was able to get enough room to remove
the battery was by taking pliers &amp; bending up the metal on the rear rim of
the battery compartment.  Tell me this isn't something I'll have to do
every time I remove the battery !!!!!  I did move the seat as far forward
as possible, &amp; swivel it to the side, which gained a couple millimeters
more clearance.  But the whole base of the seat covers the first inch or so
of the battery compartment &amp; I couldn't figure out how to actually move the
base.

Help!

Thanks!
Kathy
