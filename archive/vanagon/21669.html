Well, the horn on the old ones are real easy.  The horn is outside under 
the van on the drivers side.  A positive wire runs to it.  The a ground 
wire runs up through the middle of the steering column and attaches to 
the horn button.

That's it. the horn makes a ground, and goes BEEP.

Simple things to check:

Do you have a horn?
Two wires attached to it?
Wire attached at button?
