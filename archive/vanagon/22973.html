Big Joe

It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled like a love-sick
dog, as the rain beat a nervous staccato on the windshield.
The tires on the road made an angry hissing sound, trying to keep
my little bus securely on the asphalt. The wipers strained and moaned
against the flood, pushing the flood one way and then another.
The road could barely be seen in the dim glow of my headlights.
I hadn't seen it this bad in many years.

As I rounded a curve, my headlights reflected off the back of an
18-wheeler driving slowly ahead of me. I slowed down and kept back
from his trailer, wishing to avoid the spray from his wheels. I could
see the lights clearly and the large letters on one rear door, spelling
&quot;Big Joe&quot; with a cartoon character underneath. The sight of this
cheered me up considerably.

Driving behind the truck was much easier, as his big tires moved
most of the water out of the way. And I soon learned to
trust his instincts as he braked for curves or swung wide for large
puddles or fallen rocks.  We drove on for what seemed like several
hours, until the rain began to slacken and the wind died to just a
steady breeze.  The truck began to pick up a little speed, so I
tagged right along behind.

We hadn't seen any other traffic in either direction since I met up
with the truck. And pretty soon, I could see the lights of a truck
stop up ahead. I decided a cup of coffee would be just about perfect
right now, so I pulled into the parking lot. &quot;Big Joe&quot; hit a couple
of blasts on his air horns and kept rolling down the road. I guess he
had known I was back there, after all.

It was still drizzling as I made my way into the coffee shop, so I got
a little wet. The smell of the food brightened my spirits considerably.
The folks sitting around inside looked at me a bit curiously, however,
and I asked the waitress about it when she came over.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, as she poured my cup of coffee, &quot;They're just surprised
that you made it through in this weather. Highway 41 has been closed
now since three o'clock.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I smiled, &quot;I'd have never made it if it hadn't been for that
trucker, Big Joe.&quot;

And with that, she dropped the coffee pot, smashing the glass on the
floor, spraying hot coffee all over her legs and my feet. Her face was
the color of the napkins, and her eyes were the size of half-dollars.

&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said, trying to wipe as much of the coffee off my shoes
as I could. I looked around at the other folks in the coffee shop and
they looked pretty much the same as she did.

&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I repeated, &quot;Did I say something wrong?&quot;

By this time, another waitress had recovered and brought a broom and
a mop to clean up the mess. &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;It's just that we haven't
heard anything about Big Joe in a long time. He's dead, you see. Years
ago, he was leading some cars down the road, in a storm just about like
this one, when a rock slide carried him and his truck over the edge and
down to river at the bottom.&quot;

This time, I was the one who dropped the coffee.
