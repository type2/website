hey there all,
	well, i don't know if he wants our help in this way but life
is meant to be new and fun and i think that driving a knowledgeable
and intresting stranger would be both.  anyway assuming that it could
be on a weekend (and hopefully not labor day as i will already be far
away from here) i could go visit friends in seattle and pick up bob
and take him to salem or eugene,  oregon, or is there someone who
could take hime from seattle to my home in portland and i could go a
little farther than eugene.  i've seen others say they will take him
from SF to salis and LA to home(?).  anyway, anyone else intrested?
it seems he has helped more than one or two people on this list and
that a good number of us here like him and his postings so what do you
say we try and make the net a little less anonymous and a little more
personable?  

anyway, i'm feeling happy and feel like helping out.  hope others will
too.  take care all, i'll be asking questions again soon...

p.s.
i guess i could do this now also... HEY EVERYONE!  i'm brandy smith, a
24 yr old silly guy in portland oregon working for THE MAN (aka Intel
or other big buisness type place).  just left grad school not to long
ago and drove from south carolina to oregon in my 1973 blue camper
bus, taking time to KAYAK (my other love besides my bus), mountain
bike and hike along the way.   i am new to this mechanic thing but got
the bus to learn how, and fell in love with the big blue beast along
the way.  any other bus lovers in portland?  if so, any &quot;vw clubs&quot;
here that are worth checking out.  i really don't know any other bus
mechanics (even though there are millions of them in this city) and
would love to meet one or two.  anyway hope everyone has a good day...
