&gt; Judging from the tone of some six recent posts on the subject, 
&gt; I take it that I am not the only 95-96 EV owner
&gt; who would like to add some stripes or decal to the
&gt; all-white exterior look.

	I don't know about stripes and decals, but that big blank panel on
the driver's side is crying out for a mural!  Something witty, something VW.
