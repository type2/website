Subject:       Synthetic Gear Oil

Just got Kyra home last night, dealer replaced an oil seal &amp; tested 
cooling system (ok) as part of the deal. Engine's nice &amp; clean &amp; no 
oil spots now!

Also as part of the deal was getting (and checking) all the papers 
since new - the engine, trans, muffler, and cat ($1480!!!) were all 
replaced at 166k, for a total of $11,500 before taxes... Ouch. :-) A 
quick check through the rest of it showed at least another $6-8K 
over the last 5 years or so, including regular oil changes (albeit at 
the rather long VW interval of 12,000 km). I also got the log book 
showing more details, and *every* manual that came with, even the 
little fridge &amp; stove one :-))

Since we're due to leave for Calif in 6 weeks or so, I'd like to 
change engine &amp; trans oil to synthetic - I've got some 5w50 already 
(&amp; VW filters...), but have yet to find synthetic trans oil around 
here (Victoria). I got some for my Jetta a few years back at the 
dealer (they just pumped a few litres from a drum), but there must a 
better source!

BTW, has anyone experienced changes in compression readings? I tested 
127-130-140-125 (I think, from memory), but a check three months ago 
at the dealer showed all 140-145, and previous checks indicated 
ranges from 130 up to 165 at different times over the past two years.
Is this just a case of inaccurate gauges?

All in all, we're thrilled with our new family member, and having all 
papers &amp; manuals makes it even better (kind of like a new car without 
the sticker shock... :-)
