Subject:      Third Steering rack!

I think my power steering problems will be put to death.

The third power steering rack has been put in today, after being told that
it was my power steering pump giving too much pressure to the rack, thus
blowing the input shaft seal, I said-----let me check it out first, after a
bunch of calls and no one who services vans telling me it was a common
problem(over pressure) I called back to the shop replacing the rack.
contact at the chop came to the same conclusion, the rack rebuilder also
just happened to admit that they had had a problem with a few seals. My
shop said it came from west coast metrix, any one else had the same
experience?

Is this a new world record or do I have to blow a few more racks to make it
to the top of the list?

The only reason that I have them continue is that I paid for the original
rack and that has been it, the repair shop has been quite good about it
all.
