Subject: '87 Vanagon (No engine, for sale in Atlanta)

I read the classifieds in the Atlanta Constitution and I came across this on
Friday.  I drove my '85 down to Newnan to look at it and sure enough, the
engine is gone, the exhaust system, alterantor, and some of the fuel
injection stuff is laying on the engine lid.  I'm pretty sure the rest of
the stuff is still in the engine compartment.  The body is in pretty good
shape, needs new bumpers front and rear, the rest of the defects are mostly
just dirt.  The vehicle itself only has 80,000 miles on it.

The question is this: Considering that I may have to put a new engine in my
'85 model (with 140,000 miles) within the next year, what do you think my
prospects for buying this one and putting a factory rebuild in.  My mechanic
says the engine costs around $2,500 and with labor and new parts that he
says VW will insist on to honor the warranty on it total out around $3,500.
Will this price be significantly higher considering the '87 has a 2.1?

I think I can get the trashed '87 for about $1,000, maybe less--it's been
sitting for a while.

Consensus of the group?
