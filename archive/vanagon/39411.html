Subject: problems with bosch platinum spark plugs

hey now,

i put in bosch platinums this sunday....and am having some problems now.
seems i back fire a little when i first start the engine. i push down on the
gas , the engine revs, then it wants to cut off when the engine is starting
to idle. i understand the platinums tend to run a little richer..what should
i do, go  back to regular bosch plugs...adjust the carb? what?

i don't really feel a difference with the platinums, any suggestions?

jonathan
