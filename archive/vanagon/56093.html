Subject: Any last words?

The water pump in my '86 GL has got to go.  I've got a new pump on the way,
I've printed out the FAQ, got the Bentley warmed up, I *think* I'm ready.

 I plan to remove and replace the pump.  Since I've got the system open
anyway, I will drain, refill and bleed the cooling system.

 Am I missing anything?  Does anyone have any last words of advice before I
begin?
