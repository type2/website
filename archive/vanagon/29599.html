Subject: Vanagon mudflaps

Hi Everyone.  Just in time for the Christmas Season, I have assembled 
some pictures, and a parts list for the mudflaps I made up for my 
Syncro Westy.  For those of you with web browsers, I invite you to go 
check it out at: http://www.bcit.bc_dot_ca/~hyates

It is on my VW page, naturally.  Those of you with Vanagons that are 
planning to go up the the Great White North (Inuvik), might find 
these pictures interesting... those flaps will help you!!  I also 
invite you to read our experience, and check out the pictures that my 
wife and I took on that same trip we did in 1989. There is also a 
brochure from Arctic Canada that has a Vanagon with a wire guard on 
the front end.  This is in my &quot;travelling&quot; section of my home page.

Enjoy, and I'm open to comments.

Harry.
