Subject: Re: Bus drivers and waving.

Wow, all this talk of vanagon owners not waving... hear the S.E. part of PA, 
where I might see a splity once a year (I'm not kidding) it's rare for a 
Vanagon owner NOT to wave.  I even get waves from  Eurovans.  What I'm 
surprised at is how few bug owners wave.
