&gt; Sometime ago, I inquired about antitheft devices for the vanagon (diesels).
&gt; Amazingly, I saw this in the newsgroup alt.revenge.  It seems that this same

     I own a diesel and I keep a pair of roller skates on the side of my
house just in case of such an emergency.
I tested this theory with my significant other and nine times out of ten I
beat her to the stop sign down the street.
