Subject: RE: Flywheel removal question


&gt;        I was just wondering if there is any other way to remove that
&gt;36mm gland nut (I think that's what it's called) which holds onto my
&gt;flywheel besides using an impact driver.  What does everyone else use?


I got a 5-foot length of mild steel pipe, 3&quot;diameter, 1/4&quot; thick walls,
and welded a 3/4&quot; drive socket onto one end at right angles. Then
any 3/4&quot; 36mm socket (46 mm for bus axle nut), and she either comes off
or breaks off.  :)

To hold the flywheel/entire engine still, I got a 5' length of 1-1/2&quot; angle 
iron,
and drilled holes near one end to match two of the bolts that hold the
clutch on. Bolt the angle iron to the flywheel, put the socket and persuader 
bar
onto the gland nut, pull them together scissors-style.

I've encountered exactly one nut this persuader bar couldn't loosen:
an axle nut on a 66 bus, aout ten years ago. I was eventually chinning
myself on the bar, slamming the entire bus violently up and down...
no dice. The end of the bar is now slightly bent, at about a 15-degree
angle. When people ask me why, I just smile enigmatically...

Yes, I DID remove the cotter pin from the axle nut before trying to
loosen it.  :)  And used WD-40, Liquid Wrench (the kind that actually
worked, before they improved it and made it environmentally safe), tap
hammer, and a propane torch. Shoulda called Bob, I guess.
