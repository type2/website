Subject: Power &amp; Heat


Hello all,

On our way back from our weekly pilgrimage from Rhode Island to New
Hampshire in our '84 Westy,  we saw a most interesting sight.  We were
traveling down 128 (really 95 south), when my girl friend said look at that,
pointing to a enormous 30+ foot motor home trailer that we were approaching.
Never having seen such a large trailer on this road we both stared as we
passed it, what we saw next almost knocked me out of my seat.  This huge
motor home trailer was being towed by a ~89 VW Vanagon!   The Vanagon was
even keeled and travailing down the road at 65 mph.  This came as quite a
shock to me especially since I just spent the last 2 hours in NH trying to
get my unloaded Westy to go up the slightest of hills!   Anyway, is the 2.1
that much more powerful then the 1.9??  What gives here, I've never seen
anything like this and don't know if it's normal.
Next issue, heat.  I can't turn the heat completely off in my van.  I've
turned the control to the 'cold' setting and made sure the vents are closed,
but the center heating unit under the dash in the middle still heats up and
pushes hot air out around the closed vents.   This also happens with the
rear heater, even when the switch is turned to 'no heat' hot air still leaks
out.  Is this the price I must pay for heat during the winter, or is there a
way to turn the heat off completely? 

Thanks,
Mike D.
