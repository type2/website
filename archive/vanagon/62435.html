&gt;  Do the dealers still stock masks for Vanagons?


I doubt many dealers do, but I have them for $99.95, which is less than the
dealers charged anyway.  
These are the genuine O.E.M. Volkswagen bras, with &quot;Vanagon&quot; embroidered
into them, and yes they do have a hole for the antenna.  They're pretty
nice; I've sold a number of them. One thing is they're designed
specifically for square-headlight Vanagons ('86-up), which is nice if you
have an '86 up but kinda sucks if you have an older one.  (Pre-'86 genuine
VW bras can no longer be had from any source I can find.) 
I also have Eurovan bras for $17 more.
