Subject: the FEAR


	I mistakenly posted this on the Vintage VW list so those of you
that are on that it is the same.

Ralf wrote about the great fear I also had once as I think most people
once had.  I use to be afraid to check the valves, points, or anything
else.  Since I am only 23 and have only been a VWuber since I was 16
I don't have the wealth of knowledge that some of the others on the net
have.  However I think I, and I hope most of you do as well, have the
desire to LEARN about the great creation we all own or hope to own.
I went from being afraid of touching my first beetle to rebuilding
my bus engine and attempting to master fuel injection.  I don't
think twice about taking my engine out and ripping it down if it
is necessary.
        Now when the beast is running well I an almost bored because
I don't have anything to fix on it, accept inprovements beyond the
engine.
        When I was little I had mud to play in and now I have grease
and oil.

        Just my thoughts
	Brent
