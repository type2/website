So dean c aukes says:
&gt; 
&gt; Question - What is the trade off in engine life for higher rpm vs time, i.e. 
&gt; if I drive 70 miles _at_ 70mph it takes me 1 hour (theoretical).  If I drive 
&gt; the same 70 miles at 55mph, it takes me 1 hr 15 min (theoretical).  Assuming 
&gt; proper maintenance, what is the cost of speed in terms of engine life?  Will 
&gt; an engine run at slower speeds have a 10% longer life?  Or is it like 
&gt; someone on this list once said - that your engine is given a certain number 
&gt; of rpms in its life.  You use them fast or slow (within reason).

I have to admit that my first knee-jerk reaction was to drive faster, but
as I thought about the extra load on the engine every day and a hint  
from Joel, I decided to back off and drive 60mph again.  The main reason 
is that I want to maintain the engine as long as I possibly can.  Now this 
is a 5mph decrease in speed and I'm not really sure if it makes much dent 
in the saving of engine life at all.  Especially with freeway driving.  
Steady freeway driving at 55, 60, 65 and 70 miles per hour are not going 
to have that much effect on my engine.  Now an air-cooled engine in the 
middle of a hot summer day?  I think I'd back off some on the speed because 
of the extra heat.  My best guess is that you might be taking about 5k to
10k miles off of the engine life at most, but I'm not really sure on this
one.  It's the starts and stop and go of city driving that really wear
an engine out.


&gt; 
&gt; How many of you drive 70mph?
&gt;
Only if I'm in a real hurry.  And I'm usually not.
