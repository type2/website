Subject: '86 Vanagon

I saw a beautiful Vanagon for sale in a parking lot today.  Get this -- I 
could FEEL that it was out there!  I didn't know for sure, but I came out 
of Popcorn Packers, looked around, and there it was.

No rust, beautiful interior, no price tag.  I have a call in to the guy 
who owns it -- my kids said he was a &quot;computer hacker looking type -- 
looks like the guy in StarGate.  Nice looking.&quot;  

The mileage looked to be 150,000+.  If that's on the original engine, I 
suppose we'd have to consider the price of an engine job sometime soon?

What price should I be looking at for something like this?  The inside 
and the outside beat our '83 hands down, yet I'm not discontent with 
ours.

Nancy
