&gt; attach it when we stop. Would this work? What sort of coupling could I 
&gt; use on the outside? Do they make a kit for this?
&gt;

Got a gas BBQ and a 20# tank? If so you're almost done.  The fittings in a
Westy are flared type, and my (CDN?) BBQ hose screws right into them.  I can
connect directly to fridge or stove, or bypass my regular tank.  Do your
installation with proper copper piping, with flare fittings, and bring it
through the floor somewhere away from road spray. Just behind a front
jackpost would be good.  Then screw in the bottle after you park.  The
regulator on your BBQ will work fine. 

        Once again! Use hard lines inside the bus, and flared couplings.
Last thing you want is rubber hose that rots away slowly or tears apart in a
crash, and crimp connectors or band clamps will both let go far more easily
than flared type.  You can also buy adapters that screw the small 1# tanks
into a flared connector, for one night stands.  Tim
