&gt; From: &quot;Dan Houg&quot; &lt;fairwind_at_northernnet_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Subject:       oil drain plug repair
&gt; 
&gt; i thought i'd relate a repair i just did...  the hole in the case of
&gt; this '87 i have stripped out this weekend, again a victim of dealer
&gt; servicing.  after calling many people and talking to the dealer here
&gt; (not the one that stripped it) i had quite a plethora of
&gt; possibilities for repair ranging from one of those cheapo rubber
&gt; plugs you insert with a 'needle' to tapping the hole with a spark
&gt; plug insert and brazing up a 14mm spark plug for an oil plug.
&gt; 
&gt; the most expensive repair was to install a heli-coil (dealer did not
&gt; have the 'kit' to do this) so i choose that route :)  let me say that
&gt; after completeing this, it is absolutely the best way to go.  i
&gt; bought a new drain plug to go with the new stainless steel threads of
&gt; the heli-coil and that ol' plug just threads in so fine until it hits
&gt; the gasket.  the only resistance is the film of oil... we're talking
&gt; smoooth, folks!
&gt; 
&gt; costs:
&gt; heli-coil kit for 14 mm X 1.5 mm  $77.00 comes with 6 inserts
&gt; 9/16 drill bit $16
&gt; new drain plug $5
&gt; 
&gt; a couple comments-- the heli-coil comes about 1 inch long, the casing
&gt; is about 3/8&quot; thick so they need to be cut down.  this is easily
&gt; accomplished by snipping one coil at a time with a diagonal side
&gt; cutter.  when drilling out the casing and tapping it i was paranoid
&gt; about filings.  i stuck an air hose in the dip-stick tube and had air
&gt; flowing all the while i was drilling and tapping.  this really kept
&gt; the hole clean and the chips shot out of the hole as they were
&gt; released.  break off the heli-coil 'tang' not by punching it like the
&gt; instructions but just wiggle it back and forth with a needle-nose--
&gt; it snaps right off and stays in the needle-nose.
&gt; 
&gt; now here's the best part... the VW service manager said he'd buy the
&gt; heli-coil kit from me when i was done as they run into stripped
&gt; threads quite a bit!!!  sometimes it pays to get out of bed.
