Subject: FS 4x4 chassis

I recently wrecked my 93 Isu** LS Trooper and am going to sell it as is or
part it out.
Has 42000 mi. 5 speed manual trans with HI and Lo range transfer case.  The
body is totally wrinkled but the box I beam frame, 195 hp 6 cyl engine,
transmission, drive train, electronics, instruments, and alloy wheels all
appear to be in good working order. Can hear engine run.  I would perfer to
sell as is - you take away. This may be the opportunity that some Vanagon
owner/ customizer is looking for --&gt; the ultimate 4x4.  Don't hesitate - I
will have to settle this in the next two weeks. 

Also, does anyone know of an Isu** list where I could post this message.
