&gt;Well, this is 'sorta' having to do with VWs in general, but more
&gt;specifically to our '86 Westy.  Does anyone have the German translation
&gt;for &quot;Turtle&quot;?? We are trying to work on a name.

well, the proper word, as has been said, is Schildkro:te, which seems to be
the same for turtle or tortoise, and literally means &quot;shielded toad&quot;. :(

but rooting around, and reading between the lines, gives up Turtel as a
possible translation. want to call it a snail/slug? :)  that's Schnecke.
you could paint a big letter 'S' on the side ... then you'd really be an
S-car-go. :) &lt;old joke&gt;

what about the latin scientific name for turtle/tortoise? Tartarus. with a
little big of zoological checking round, you could even pick the particular
color/shape/variety turtle/tortoise you wanted. or make up your own name
from german words: Kubeltier (bucket animal)? Schnellschneke (quick-snail)?

or the german word for armadillo ... Gu:rteltier (Girdle-animal)?? could
call her Gerty? :) or use the scientific name: Daisy, for Dasypodidae.
