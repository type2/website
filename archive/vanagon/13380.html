Subject: Re: Rust Question



I've just finished going over the van &quot;repairing&quot; superficial rust spots,
(you know, the little dings on the edges of doors, esp. the leading
edge of the sliding door), with a product from &quot;plasti-Cote&quot;.

I can't remember the trade name, but it is a milky-white, almost latex
looking liquid which you paint onto the affected area (after removing any
loose rust, but not sanding down to bare metal), and as it dries, it turns
the rust a black colour and leaves a slightly amber plastic coating. I did
it purely as a stop-gap remedy until I can do the proper touch-up paint
routine. The resulting coating seems, so far, to be quite tough.
