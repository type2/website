Subject: Re: Help: Broken Cylinder Head bolt

I'd have to agree with other respondant who says &quot;take it to a pro&quot;.

Having lived through a number of broken or stripped exhaust studs (which I
have repressed the exact number, near four or five), I have learned to pull
the motor, pull the head, and take it to the man. 

If you pay $100 to have the studs drilled out and reset you will rest easy
knowing that it won't happen again soon.

BTW...all of the little hangers that support the exhaust system's weight are
ABSOLUTELY necesary. without them, the weight of the exhaust is pullin on
your exhaust studs. BAD.
