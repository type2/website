Allright Volks, 

The '87s engine finally gave up the ghost -- Blowing black smoke,
missing power on at least one cylinder, etc... (I just had it towed
home -- I'll look at it once we get to temperatures which, at least
will be better than freezing inside the garage).  I guess I cannot
complain, with 142,000+ miles on it, the poor thing lasted a lot
longer than traditional for a VW van engine.

Time to get the '82 diesel westy back on the road.  I need to buy a
front wheel bearing for it (driver's side, if it matters).  I checked
the archives and tried a couple of the places listed as parts
suppliers.  They tried to help, but said they did not have a part
number, and did not know how to get it.  (volks motorsports and volks
cafe did not have anyone to answer the phone -- wake up west
coast!!!).  I hate to go to the local VW dealer and beg them to order
this part for me.

Any ideas for where/how I can order this will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Cetin
