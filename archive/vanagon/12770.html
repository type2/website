I have been told that in the US a &quot;clean air act&quot; forces all car-manufactures
to provide all their technical information at reasonable cost to
everyone interested. SAE-2008 is a standard related to this.
I don't know if the law is already operational, but of course,
it is at least a very good idea for the future.

In Germany, VW provides technical documentation to all their 
official VAG repair shops. For other repair shops their exists some
grey literature (all in German). (My support system is also in German,
I have only translated 2 pages for papers in English)
I guess that an official VW-distributor should have the docu in english?
The advice to exchange the Digifant without any further testing is
really strange. Maybe you should look for another repair shop?

Of course the Digifant-MMS can be the source of every trouble, but it
is only one part: sensors, actuators, connectors and cables can also
be faulty. (In many cases the single fault assumption is valid:
the trouble is caused by only one problem) As far as I know, the
Digifant itself is relatively robust.

Digifant has a fault-memory. With help of a VAG-1551 it can be read out.
In all standard cases, the fault-memory will be able to locate the fault.

Thank you Martin, for your quick response.

I never heard of this law.

1. Yes, this is what I want to buy--the grey literature for Digifant system
used in a VW Van with Digifant (1986-1991). Do you know of where I can
purchase this or can you help me obtain this? I prefer english of course but
if I have to I will settle for German.

2. I am very interested to hear you translated two pages of Digifat data to
english. Is it easy to send by e-mail?

&gt;I guess that an official VW-distributor should have the docu in english?

There is a document in english but I would like to see a fuller or
alternative treatment of the subject. 

&gt;The advice to exchange the Digifant without any further testing is
&gt;really strange. Maybe you should look for another repair shop?

Well, I have to admit that this is not the official advice. But it is the
*universal* practice. Mechanics in USA are not encouraged to do any
testing--just replace parts one after the other.  The official VW dealers
are *worse* at this than the independent shops because they simply don't care. 

The best service comes from small shops as far away from a big city as possible.

&gt;Of course the Digifant-MMS can be the source of every trouble, but it
&gt;is only one part: sensors, actuators, connectors and cables can also
&gt;be faulty. (In many cases the single fault assumption is valid:

There is no information about the VAG 1551 in any USA manual on Digifant for
VW Vans. Our manuals refer only to a VAG 1367 tester, which does not have
fault-memory so far as I know. I have purchased a used 1367 tester but I
have yet to try it to see if it works.

I have never heard that Digifant as implemented in VW vans has fault-memory.
There is no documentation of this in the USA. I know this because have every
manual and factory microfiche and technical docuemnt for USA Digifant and
none of them mention this. This is why I want to buy a manual from Europe
which might have more information.

 Are you sure the original Digifant has fault memory or is this only with
Digifant II or some later version of Digifant?

If you knew of how to spend the money, Martin, perhaps I could send you some
so you could send me a manual from Europe?

Thank you in anticipation,  

Derek Drew
