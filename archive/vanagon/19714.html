Subject: Re: 82 rebuild advice sought

So Roy Jared Michael says:
&gt; 
&gt; I live in Boulder CO. I have been talking to Verners VW and Wolfgang's VW 
&gt; repair. Both have quoted me around $2200 - $2500 for the rebuild. Or I 
&gt; can get one from GEX for around $1600 plus $400 core charge plus either 
&gt; place will put the GEX one in for $400. What should I do? All the places 
&gt; offer 12 months 12,000 miles.

I think I'd go with the local guy.  That way if anything goes wrong, you
can complain to them directly.  GEX is in the mags, but I rather (if I
had to) be able to get in the persons face if something goes wrong and
they're not willing to fix it.

&gt; 2nd question. I really only need a valve job and new rings, one of the 
&gt; places I talked to said he would do a top-end rebuild for $1500 and the 
&gt; other guy said you are crazy to just do the top-end because the bottom 
&gt; end is going to go soon after. The van has 100,000 on it. 

I wouldn't do the top end because you have too many miles on the engine
IMO.  Unless you plan to sell it soon.


&gt;  Can you please 
&gt; give me some advice before I blow my piggy bank.

Ooooo, pretty kinky!  ;)
