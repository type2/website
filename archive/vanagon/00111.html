Subject: Re: 5-cyls in a Vanagon? Which ones?
Date: Wed, 6 Apr 94 15:42:55 GMT

 Hi,

&gt; A recent post mentioned something about a 5-cylinder engine in a later
&gt; vanagon.  Is this a stock engine for the later models?

 The newer, front engined, vans can have a five cylinder diesel engine
fitted. I wouldn't expect there to be any backward compatibility with
the waterboxer engines. Is there a five cylinder petrol engine available
in the US?

&gt;							... I always felt 
&gt; that my 77 bus with the 2.0l 4 was pretty underpowered...

 Hmm, the 2.0 litre vans that I drove were plenty powerful enough for me.
They would easily manage over 80mph in UK trim, maybe they were much worse
when kitted out for the US market?

&gt; 				      ...  I think a vanagon with the Audi
&gt; 5, especially the turbo version with ~165 bhp would be pretty reasonable.

 Hmm, maybe you should look at the custom conversions that put 911 flat sixes
into vanagons, I suspect that VW don't have plans to put anything that powerful
into their vans but then what do I know? :-)

 Maybe VW will try to compete with the Renault Espace, I can see the
advertising already...

 &lt; Camera pans across rugged mountain landscape, an incredibly twisty road
devoid of traffic is being negotiated by a short-wheelbase front-engined
transporter with a windsurfer strapped to the roof, a stunningly beautiful
woman and an impossibly cute child in the passenger seat and a group of
exquisitely tailored businessmen chatting in the rear.&gt;

 *fade up ethereal music, reminiscent of Clannad being played on Didgeridoos*

 &quot;A *new* concept in sports-recreation, an executive vehicle with *space* for
a boardroom or a family car with *exciting* performance...The new
Transporter GTI from Volkswagen is all of these and more! With it's close
ratio gearbox and VR6 engine the Transporter GTI features mindblowing
acceleration, it's lowered and stiffened suspension promises spirited
handling and the 16&quot; alloy wheels with low-profile tyres offer tenacious
grip!

 &quot;Open your mind to the versatility of the Transporter GTI, the new sportsvan
from Volkswagen!&quot;

 &lt; Camera pans out from van arriving at luxury hotel, windsurfers are visible
pulling barrel rolls in the background despite total absence of wind in the
plam trees. &gt;

 *fade out*

 Actually, I rather like the idea, maybe Porsche could contribute to a
Transporter RS2? A transporter Quattro turbo? A transporter coupe?

 Nah!

Cheers,
        W.
