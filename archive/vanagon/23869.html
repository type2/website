My Mother-in-Law just called the wife. She said that an old man had recently
passed away. He had lived in a house a long time after inheriting it from
his mother. (OK, so what!) The house was all over grown. (Tell me more!) The
backyard has a lot of overgrowth (Yes!, Yes!, and...?) The neighbors were
upset about the house. (Yeah, and?). Miscellaneous cats devalued the
property. (So?, I can hang drywall and paint). She was talking about a
killer bargain (steal) on a house in a bitchen neighborhood (into which we
could never afford to move otherwise) where we could possibly make a great
deal and eliminate my hour long each way commute and no one knows about it
yet, and I thought it was important. I thought she had a line a an old bus
or something.  Sheesh! She's talking Real Estate as if it was free Netscape
stock two days before it went public and I had visions of a salmon and ivory
barndoor deluxe. I thought it was really important! Jeez, that whacky spouse
of mine... Am I headed for the 1907 &quot;House Resto From Hell&quot;?  ;)
