Subject: Wasserboxer Head Gasket

After doing the head gasket replacement job on my daughter's '91 I wrote up
the steps in fairly complete detail. Rather than posting it to the entire
list, I would like to hear from anyone who has done the job and is willing
to review my write-up.

After some others have reviewed it, I plan to incorporate the suggestions
and the put it in the archives where others can use it.

Thanks,

Herb
