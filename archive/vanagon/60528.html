Subject: Compression test

Hey guys,

Over the weekend I had a minute to finally do a compression test.  The
engine has 130K and the factory rebuilt heads have 70-80K on them. The
results are:
	#1 = 125 lbs
	#2 = 150 lbs
	#3 = 125 lbs
	#4 = 150 lbs
I see a pattern here, the front cylinders seem to have aged faster than
the rears.  Also, when I double checked #3 after checking #4, #3 read
even lower, 90 lbs.

The engine runs fine, idles a little rough, does not eat water or oil.
Should I be concerned, should I start saving now for a valve job?.  Any
ideas would be appreciated.
