I'm responding to this topic for a couple of reasons;

  I've had H-4's in All of my VW's for the last 3 years!
  
  They work quite well.  I've never had any problems with the law due to
their brightness, but when the slower driver is in front of you and you
flash him/her with your high beams becareful not to sunburn their necks!

  I paid $26.00 for my H-4's and their still that price today.  

  I know many people with late model Vanagons have discussed changing to
early model grills and installing these bulbs, this works great to as
some of us know.

  I have some early model grills if anyone is interested.
