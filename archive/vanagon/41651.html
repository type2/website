Subject: Re: EV awning tips?

Hello Jeff.  Norseman make a bracket kit for the EuroVan, and an 
awning called the Apollo.  I have a 10' Apollo box awning on my '90, 
with the Vanagon kit (although I made new brackets for it!).  The 
Norseman kit involves permanently drilling holes into the van's sheet 
metal :(.  The Vanagon kit requires NO holes to be drilled in the 
body.  If you are still interested, I can post Norseman information.  
They are in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Hope this helps,
Harry.

&gt; Has anyone added and awning to their EV that they'd recommend to others? My
&gt; wife really wants to put one on and I'm not sure where to begin looking. The
&gt; VW dealers sell awnings made for the EV Winnie that, I'm told, won't fit on
&gt; my EV MV Weekender.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
