Subject: Litchfield VW Show

This past Sunday I took my &quot;new&quot; '91 Westy to the Litchfield Bug Inn. This is
touted as the largest/best show in the Northeast, or so I am told. It certainly
drew a large crowd!

Having never been to a show, I really didn't know just what to expect. After 
getting parked in amidst lots of other &quot;Transporters '80 and up&quot; class vans,
we asked a few questions and managed to get registered. I figured for $6 I
could at least findout what someone else (who knew what they were doing) 
thought about my Westy.

The best part of the day was meeting all of the other Westy owners - especially
in my class. We exchanged information and ideas about our vehicles and some
of the different things we had done to/with them. I got to see the mudflaps I
was about to purchase - and get an order number to insure that the ones I 
ordered were what I wanted, etc. I also learned that you needed to have your
engine open! And I thought mine was a bit dirty to show to anyone else - 
although it wasn't too bad. The guy in front of me had an engine so clean you
could have eaten right off of it! I could not figure out how he drove to the
show and kept it so clean! Speaking of which, there was one really old Westy
that had 8100 miles on it - but the owners truck it everywhere . . . What fun
is that?

In the final analysis, we took 3rd place in our class! We met lots of very nice
people and had a GREAT day. I would highly recommend VW shows to anyone looking
for a good time in the sun!
