Bad groundings at the radiator heat sensors? The voltage across the
headlight grounds and 'real' ground may cause the fan switch on.
Check the wiring at the fan relay and the ground point below the
relay. What year is your Vanagon?

Just noticed this yesterday - the front cooling fan runs when the lights
are on, engine off, even when cold. ?
