Subject:  re: Moose 

If you are in Moose country, avoid at all costs
running into one.  They are much bigger and heavier
than a deer and all that weight is a whole lot
higher off the ground, on pretty spindly legs.
A half ton of meat centered 5-6 feet off the
pavement is *not* something you want to plow
into.

This is no joke.

My comments below:

Try 1 ton of meat! I've seen full size mid sixties cars with the V8 
engine in the back seat after they hit a moose. They even make a fair
mess of the front steps etc of a train engine!
Being the biggest thing in the bush, their reaction to an intruder is
to get a good solid stance, and put their heads down to challenge the 
intruder;-0
