&gt; will self said:
&gt; &gt;...I drove about 65 mph and got 22 mpg.  Coming back, I drove between 65
&gt; &gt;and 80, mostly 80, and got 21 mpg.
&gt; &gt;Are these numbers reasonable--what I can expect? ...
&gt; 
&gt; well, you guys are really getting me worried!  i have 73,000 miles on my
&gt; 88 vanagon, and have averaged 19.4 mpg over the six years. now, the BEST
&gt; i ever got was 23 mpg. i can get 22-23 mpg if i hold it down to 55-60 mph,
&gt; and don't have too many hills. but that's as good as i can get. the sticker
&gt; said 17 city, 19 highway. &lt;city for me is about 17.5 summer, 15-16 winter&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; i did a bunch of 'testing' after i put my driving computer in the bus, and
&gt; when i get up about 4000 rpm (67 mph), i'm only gonna get 18-19 mpg. and it
&gt; drops rather steeply after that.
&gt; 
&gt; i really really don't think those tools and spare parts and emergency
&gt; equipment weight THAT much. my bus weighed in (at the local truck stop) at
&gt; 3640 lbs, with full fuel tank and no people. what do the rest of you carry
&gt; around?

I wouldn't worry to much Joel (or is it joel? ;) ).  Your typical milage sound
pretty much like mine.  I would assume that the original poster (forgot the name
sorry) was speaking in general terms of speed.  It didn't sound to much different
than my beasties performance.  No biggie.
