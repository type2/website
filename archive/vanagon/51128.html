Excuuuuuuuuusssseeeeee MMMMMMEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeee!!! Lawyers and VW Karma 
don't mix??? Pardon me while I vomit a bit..... WWWWRRRRREEEEETTTTCCCHHHH!!!

Yep I'm a lawyer (amongst other things in my list of &quot;professions&quot;), 
I've been driving VWs since high school (summer of 69)....still do...tell me 
how many lawyers are still drivin' a beetle...especially a 40 year old one 
that has been owned by said lawyer for 21 years...HUH...HUH????

Ok...so I couldn't get myself back into a &quot;splittie&quot; ...had a ton of them 
back there in the 70s....so I settled for the next best thing...a 
EuroVan...yep its got A/C....yep its got POWER....but it also sits at home 
most of the time when I drive my 56...


So if you want to make snide comments about lawyers...Karma and VWs...
Step out side....if I'm not there in 15 minutes, please start without me!!


Ric  ;-)  &quot;A lawyer WITH VW Karma&quot;...or was it Karma Ghia??....or was it 
send lawyers, guns and money?&quot;
