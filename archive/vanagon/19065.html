Have you ever had the little brass tube come out of your fuel pump?
 Howzabout outta the carb?  Messy, eh?

Heres a reasonalbly good fix:

Using a mill-cut file (one row of teeth, crossing the file at an angle),
place the cleaned brass tube on a piece of wood and ROLL it back and forth
using the file and lots of pressure.  Do it slow.  And only put the file on
the portion of the tube you want to ENLARGE.

What you're doing is KNURLING the brass tube.  Knurling will increase the
diameter of the tube by a small amount due to the displacement of the brass
by the hardened steel teeth of the file. (Which is why you roll it on wood
instead of metal; metal flattens the knurls.  [No wood?  Try the sole of your
boot.])

Now clean the hole in the fuel pump or carb; get it really clean.  

Obtain some high-strength loc-tite (the green stuff, often called 'sleeve
retainer') and a can of loc-tite primer.  Prime both the hole and the brass
tube.  Put a drop of green loc-tite on the end of the tube, making sure it
spreads all the way around the tube.  Now tap that puppy into the hole.

(In theory, you should wait 24 hours.  If someone is shooting at you, give it
fifteen minutes.)

The moral of this story?  Modify your fuel pump and carb to use threaded
aircraft-type flex lines.  Push-ons are fine for a low-cost, high-volume
production line, and they'll usually get you there.  But AN-type fittings
will ALWAYS get you there.  Alive.
