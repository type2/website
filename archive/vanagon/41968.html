Subject: Re:Good deal for '86 Synchro?

I have the opportunity to purchase an '86 Vanagon Synchro.I finally crawled
out of my beer after missing out on a MINT diesel westy 'bout a month
ago.It has a
factory reman. engine w/ 10k and 120k on the chassis.A few minor dents and
no rust for $3500. The current owner has owned it for 3 yrs. w/ no
problems.Also,
he's quite sure it has locking diffs.It's hard for me to figure out the
value of this. I enlist the opinion of you synchro people out there.PLEASE
!! Does it seem worth it? Any replies or info would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.  RINALDO
