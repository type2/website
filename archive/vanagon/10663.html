&gt;
&gt;One drawback to the full Westy vs the Weekender is the lack of 
&gt;seating.  Does anyone have the single accessory seat that mounted 
&gt;behind the front passenger seat for Vanagon Westys?
&gt;
Agreed.  You can get a center seat row (short one) out of a Vanagon and
mount in the area between the rear and front seats.  The short center seat
mounts on rails and can be removed when not in use.  One think to note is
that children sitting in the seat have gas valves for the stove at eye level
so you may want to take them off.

I'd like to get a center seat for my westy too, but I just haven't had the
time yet.

Hope this helps.

Bo
