Subject: Re: 5-seater Westy?


My '76 Camper has three belts in the back, so technically, I can carry 5 
folks.  The bench IS a little narrow for three, so I dunno if I'd 
volunteer to sit back there on a longer trip, but it should be ok for a 
run to the store, etc.  The distance from the front to back would make 
fore-aft conversation difficult, but, hey, three people, might have 
something to talk about among themselves!  

Does the greater width of the Vanagon translate to a wider rear seat 
than the bus?  Narrow width wouldn't be such a problem if you have kids 
to throw back there, and you get the added plus that they can get beat 
on each other a little more loudly than if they were right behind the 
driver/passenger.  I like sitting back there myself sometimes, as my 
legs along are over 3 1/2 feet long, so it's about the only car I can 
feel comfortable in the back seat!  

As far as I can tell, the anchors for all 3 belts look original, factory 
installed.
