&gt; I do exactly the same thing as Jim on my '82. The worst thing you can do is 
&gt; over-fill the crankcase, because excess could blow out the tailpipe and gum up 
&gt; your catalytic converter. I've had heard this is the most common cause of 
&gt; cat-death (of the non-feline variety....).
On my 82, which is a diesel, if I overfilled the oil, it would blow out the
dipstick.  With my new (Ha!Ha!) engine which seems to have less blow-by, I
normally like to keep the oil 1/2 quart overfilled since these things can
suddenly lose their oil in nasty ways.  But, then again it is a diesel.
