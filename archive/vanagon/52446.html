Subject: air bags redux

one more thought about air bags and all the rhetoric regarding the govt
&quot;shoving them down our throat.&quot; Recent statistics I've seen indicate that
approx 1500 lives were saved due to air bags (I don't recall the period of
time involved.) How many were killed as a result? Several, but not
approaching that number! And they have probably reduced injury in many
other cases as well. The most recent tragedy sounds, from the initial
report, as if the parent did not have the safety seat properly fastened.

I realize that we're catering to the least common denominator here, and its
getting old. I don't know how to solve that problem. But that doesn't mean
that air bags are necessarily bad.  (but it does mean that engineering the
damn things for the average sized male is *not* the correct design!)

I'm not sure who's leading the charge *for* air bags, but I do notice that
Consumer Reports always complains when they're not an option.
(Yes I know VW owners don't like CR because they always get dissed so bad,
but a  lot of people *do* read/respect CR's opinion!)

Also, what do you think the liability of the manufacturer would be if they
allowed you to turn them off, you had an accident and could prove injury
because it was switched off? I'm not saying its right, but you know they'd
end up in court.

That said, I personally don't consider air bags a high priority. I don't
have them. I do wear seat belts (and they are required in Washington
state.)

ah well, happy holiday.
