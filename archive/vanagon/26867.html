Subject: Ltd. slip rear diff.

I was recently discussing winter vanagon experiences with a buddy of mine,
and he mentioned that a limited slip rear differential was a factory option
for two-wheel drive models.  I know a locking differential was a syncro
option, but was a similar rear diff available for two-wheelies?

Can anyone put this argument to rest???????
