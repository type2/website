Subject: My front axle...

Hi y'all...

I know you don't usuallt go begging for things on the list, but I, well...

You might remember I was going to drive my '71 Westy to MN for Christmas. 
Well, I was a-gonna, but my mechanic type, although confident in the rest of 
the brick, was a bit leery of the front axle. We took a look together, and I 
think he's right - I don't want to have the whole danged front end fall off on 
me. Thanks for all the support from those along Route 80 - I'll be sure to ask 
again in the summer when I manage to go!

What was my point? Oh yeah - anyone have a decent front axle assembly for a 
'71? I can't seem to find one out here in New York - called the yards, call 
Bus Heaven and the Parts Place... If you got one, I'm ready to pay you and 
kiss you and come get the thing... I want to go to Florida in March and an 
axle would help a lot :)

Oh - if anyone needs it, I pulled out the sink unit (I'm sorry purists, but I 
play music and needed the room for the band junk). It's in really great shape, 
and I'm tellin' ya, it looks just GREAT in the corner of the living room - I 
know my girlfriend thinks so...

Like any of this matters - the Westy and the '64 wreck are both behind an 
8-foot wall of snow... I wish I could get them out to show everyone how great 
they handle in the snow!
