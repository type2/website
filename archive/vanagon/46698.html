Subject: '74 Bus

I have recently inherited a bus and know nothing about them.  I cannot find a
repair manual for it either.  First question is do I need to take the axle
nut off to replace the drum and shoes on the rear of the bus?  Second
question is, what is the plug gap and points gap suppose to be for a stock
1785cc type two engine?  Also, the bus backfires and has extremely poor
acceleration,  What can be done?I would also like to know what the correct
wiring order, is it like my '73 beelte?  Help is greatly appreciated.  E-mail
