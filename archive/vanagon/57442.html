&gt;Dave, 
&gt;I have the same prolblem with my 87 Vanagon.  It one of those things
&gt;that I never get around to fixing.  I have started making dash light for
&gt;my van.  The high cost of $4 a bulb and the fact that the dealer told me
&gt;I could not make one, only drove me to prove him wrong.  HE WAS!


So, Kenneth, are you gonna share your strategy?

I still have dash lights, such as they are, but want to be prepared.  On my
very first x-country drive, alone, from LA to Hartford CT starting on ol'
Hwy 66 in 1963, I cracked the block on my '53 Ford station wagon somewhere
between Barstow and Needles, driving in the dark w/no dashlights, oblivious
to overheating.  Made for a really challenging trip!

Happy Spring, all.  Can't wait for my first camping trip in my new-to-me Westi.
