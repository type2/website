Subject: Re: a  really cool VW

You guyz are out to lunch with this &quot;cool VW&quot; concept.  May your realities
be limited ONLY by your dreams - why stop at one car stacked atop another?
Why not weld a golf to the left side, a jetta to the right, a 'vert
on top, a ghia on the back, and a passat on the front. 

Face it.  Is there such a thing as TOO much VW?
