Well,

Move into your bus and climb the world!

Summer before last I spent over six months living out of my Westy.  Four months
of it were on the road, mostly in Colorado, Wyoming, and California.  I was
rock-climbing full time.

Bird-bathed in creeks (no soap, don't need it).  Occasionally got hot soapy
showers from KOA type campgrounds.  Solar bag showers available from most
outdoor stores are nice, but I didn't have one.  Most of the places I stay have
porta-a-potties, but a good backpacking trowel is wonderful for digging
cat-holes.  Keep it in a zip-lock baggie.

I use an MSR Alpine cook-set supplemented with a teflon coated small frying pan
with the handle removed for smaller packing.  I think a great spice kit is
essential for survival.  Don't forget a french press for coffee.

I also have logged some pretty serious &quot;urban&quot; camping time.  I lived out of my
fan for about three months here in Raleigh, NC this fall and about two months
last fall after returning from the four month climbing trip out west.  I am in
graduate school in Raleigh, NC (graduating in three weeks!!!!  WHOOOPEEEEEEE!)

I think urban camping in the south (well east coast) in general is pretty
scary. I'm real careful about where I park.  Always have all the curtains drawn
and try to be as low profile as possible.  I only cook after dark.  I usually
cook enough for a couple of meals and keep extra in the fridge.  If anyone is
interested I can give some good hints on how ot select a &quot;camp&quot; site in the
city.  In general, you need to look like just another car parked, in a safe
neighborhood.  Usually, though it is inevitable that you make friends and find
a cool situation.  Things always work out, they have no other choice.

I concur with Martin's posts.  Essentially what you are doing is an
expeditionary style back packing trip.  There are some very good books on
back-packing available from outdoor outfitters.  They can give you an excellent
idea on how to pack.  How much clothes to bring.  How to wash the clothes you
do have.  How to be as low-impact as possible.  Excellent cooking ideas, and
ways to minimize clean up.  Ways to vary the day-to-day monotany of the
experience.  I don't have a problem with this one.

I love being on the road.

There's a great quote.  I can't remember who said it, I have it written down at
home, but here it is anyway:

&quot;All who wander are not lost.&quot;

Happy bussin (vanagonning)!
