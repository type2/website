Subject: Window Screen R or R in 86 Westy

Hi all. Quick question. I need to repair or replace the screen on the
passenger side window of my 86 Westy(summer's Coming). Should I (can I) buy
a replacement or do I (can I) repair the one there now. The screen is
ripped at the bottom front corner and now is held in with duck tape. Thanks
