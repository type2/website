&gt;I was talking to the FLAP guy recently about the hardware on my pop-top (is
&gt;it VW hardware or standard hardware?). He asked me whether it was a Westfalia
&gt;or was the conversion done aftermarket. Well, I had always assumed there was
&gt;no difference. A brief check of the old paperwork reveals the conversion was
&gt;done by Country Home Campeer Co. of Oakland, Ca. I tried contacting them,
&gt;they appear to be out of business.
&gt;So, I have two questions....
&gt; 1) If I don't have a Westfalia, what do I have?
&gt; 2) Has anyone else a conversion by this company? (if so, I have further
&gt;questions about wiring up an auxilliary battery and so on)
&gt;
&gt;puzzled,

&gt;'76 Westfalia?

I - regarding to the sticker on the pop top - have a 1980 Vanagon camper
conversion done by County Home, California, and thats exactly what I call it.
