Subject: Re: Sticky Steering-'85 Westy

&gt; When steering to the right the wheels sticks slightly coming back when 
&gt; straightening out.  Sometimes I hear a little squeek or rubbing noise.  
&gt; Is this serious or maybe just cured with well placed grease?  I can't 
&gt; tell if it's the wheel or steering rack.

Mine did this also. I lubed the the U joints leading to the rack &amp; 
the problem went away. I also flushed the power steering system, but 
don't think this was the problem. Try raising the front end and 
turning wheels with engine on &amp; off. Mine had the problem even when 
off, which lead to the U joints being suspect.
