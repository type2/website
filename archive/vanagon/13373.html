So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; Steve: I don't have a diesel and don't have an auxiliary gas heater
&gt; either, but on both counts they would be on my $30,000 wish list. I figure
&gt; to buy a gas heater for our 82 right now would cost about the same as the
&gt; amount we paid for the van...
&gt; 
&gt; There are plenty o'Canadians with the gas heater system in their vans;
&gt; they should be able to shed some light on this....  
&gt; 

I though for sure you had a diesel.  Oh well, my mistake, sorry about that.
All the more reason for you to be able to answer the query. ;)

Cheers!
