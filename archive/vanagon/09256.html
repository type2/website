Tom,

Just a couple of quick thoughts:

1)  $21k for a '93 EV GL is waaaaay too much to ask, nevermind pay, especially
    if it's got 18k miles on it.  Heck, I almost paid less than that for a
    fully optioned MV (but without Weekender poptop, auto.) brand new.
    Me?  I'd start at &lt;$15k and be ready to walk...

2)  If you must deal with Lewis VW, I hear Steve Lewis is a good guy; my own
    experiences with them have been rather negative, as have those of friends
    of mine that bought a '90 Vanagon Carat from them.

3)  I don't want to tell you how to spend your money, but from what I've read
    on this list so far from other EV owners, I don't/haven't see/heard any
    solid evidence that the EV is going to be a high cost/maintenance vehicle.
    Of course, YMMV....

4)  I like your idea of getting a '90 (or '91?) Vanagon w/Weekender; personally
    I think that's the best way to go, although you're probably not going to
    catch much of a price break on that  :(  (compared w/ the EV, that is).
    Plus, if you get one, you still have the tech. sppt. of the list here  :)
    Another thing you could do is buy a regular Vanagon and add the poptop via
    Country Homes, or something like that.  I think it'd *only* cost ~$4k for
    the poptop, or ~$8k for a full camper conversion (better than Westfalia,
    IMHO)

5)  F-O-R-D  Well, Tom, if you wait long enough, your next NEW VW bus WILL be
    a Ford!  :O

Well, so much for my quick thoughts...  Do the right thing, Tom.
