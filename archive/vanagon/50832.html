Subject: FS:  '85 Westfalia GL, $4250 (Pa.) (avail. again)

A couple of weeks ago I said I'd let the list know if this camper was still 
available, having agreed to hold it for the first person who'd responded. 
Well, car problems have prevented him from even coming to look at it, so it 
is still available.  Below is the info from the original post.

	            -------------------------------------

This camper was bought in Germany and brought to the US by the original 
owner.  It is sort of a metallic brown/copper color with a light brown 
poptop, and is in excellent running condition.

Runs &amp; drives great!  4 speed. 109,000 miles. Recently rebuilt power 
steering rack, recent alignment, newer water pump, newer exhaust.  Have all 
repair records since the van was in Germany.  Trailer hitch. Power 
steering/brakes. No A/C.  Mechanically needs nothing that I know of.

Interior is very nice. (This camper has the upgraded interior, with plusher 
valour seats, armrests, etc..)  Full camping package: Sink, stove, fridge 
(AC/DC/propane), sofabed, table in rear, etc.  (Missing small front table, 
as usual.)  Poptop canvas is perfect.

Body is decent. Looks nice, and has no dents.  However, there is the 
typical surface rust along the seams, and along one seam the rust has 
spread out about 3&quot; wide.  Also some surface rust next to the drivers door 
handle, and on the lip of two wheel wells. However, this is all surface 
rust - no holes.  Also, there was rust around the 3 camper inlets on the 
drivers side (the jacks for AC plug, city water, and water tank fill). The 
previous owner, reasoning that these inlets are not needed (you can fill 
the sink tank or run the fridge without them) simply riveted a metal plate 
over them rather than fix them.  This and a cracked windshield are the only 
real flaws with the camper.

The camper currently has 5-spoke 15&quot; aftermarket Vanagon mags that the 
previous owner purchased in Germany.  The asking price of $4250 includes 
the stock wheels and hubcaps; I'd want a little extra for the chrome 
wheels, or would sell them separately.

I am in Pa., between Philadelphia and Allentown.  Email or (610) 754-8989 
for more info.
