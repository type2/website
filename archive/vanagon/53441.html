Subject: Re: lighting questions

I recently repaired a poor wiring job done on my 87 syncro. The previous
owner drille a hole in the dash by the passenger's side (poor
ergonomics), I believe he did this only because he ran out of wire. Well
I bought a three way fog/driving switch from the local Portland VW
dealeship and installed it. The only problem I had was getting the diode
on the switch to light up. The switch came with no directions and I'm no
electrical wizard. Any advice ?

Thanks

&gt; I agree with Joel.  One of the first things I did to my van was install a fog
&gt; light on the back bumper and wire it to one of the back-up lights.  It is very
&gt; easy to do.  The wires go in the pull down license plate area. One goes to
&gt; ground and the positive right to the harness junction for the back-up light. I
&gt; have had this set-up for 6-7 months now with no problems in the wiring. Now I
&gt; can see things behind me at nite and people definetly know when I am
&gt; backing-up.
&gt; 
&gt; I also installed fog lights on the front that I use full time to supplement
&gt; the poor excuse stock headlights as well as baja lights for off-road and bad
&gt; storms.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,

&gt; To: Multiple recipients of list
&gt; 
&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I have a quick question about lighting.  I've got an '81 Vanagon but I'm
&gt; posting to both lists because there are probably some Type2er's who can
&gt; help me out.
&gt; 
&gt; What I want is brighter lights for the brake light (which is a separate
&gt; bulb from the tail light in a Vanagon) and the back-up lights.  VW calls
&gt; for 21 watt bulbs for each of these applications.  I noticed in RMMW's
&gt; Cabriolet catalog that they sell an adaptor that will allow you to use a
&gt; 20-watt quartz halogen high intensity bulb in place of the stock 21-watt
&gt; incandescent bulb.  They advertise it for use in brake lights and back-up
&gt; lights.  I was wondering how hot these halogen bulbs get.  Would they melt
&gt; the lens or what?  Also, RMMW wants $24.95 for a set of two adaptors (I
&gt; think the bulbs are included).  That seems kind of pricey.  Has anyone seen
&gt; this type of adaptor before in a FLAPS?  I haven't.
&gt; 
&gt; I currently have 35-watt incandescent bulbs in place of the stock 21-watt
&gt; bulbs for brake lights and back-up lights.  They are brighter than the
&gt; 21-watt bulbs but not as bright as I was expecting.  How much brighter
&gt; would a 20-watt quartz halogen bulb be than the stock 21-watt bulb.
&gt; Basically the idea here is to be able to see behind the van when backing up
&gt; (Joel would say &quot;Put a fog light on the back and wire it up&quot; -- I don't
&gt; know if I want to do that) and to have brake lights that say &quot;I'm stopping
&gt; NOW, dammit!&quot;  Should I go for these halogen dealies?  Anyone have them on
&gt; their van?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Sean
