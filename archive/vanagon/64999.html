Subject:      Re: AMC spain??

&gt; &gt; I hear of good success repairing heads, but AMC of Spain also makes
&gt; &gt; replacement heads that are good, and a lot cheaper than VW original.
&gt;
&gt; So who is AMC of Spain? How to get in touch?
&gt; What does AMC mean, American motor company? Searched the net for a while
&gt; but no hits in Spain
&gt; --

Once again, AMC heads are in fact the only new heads currently
available, they are produced with the factory tooling which AMC
purchased and are of a superior alloy, but lose their seats faster.
For rebuild go with Mark Stephens and save yourself money.  AVP maybe
but I currently am a bit annoyed at them we will see how it works
out.
