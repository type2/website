Subject:      FS: '84 Westy - Ottawa

I've come accross an '84 Westy with a motor (leaking head gaskets I think)
problem.  The owner is looking for offers.  It is green, has 130 k on the
clock, and has never been driven in the winter she tells me it's like new
in and out.  I have not seen it yet and just spoke on the phone to the
owner.  If anyone is interested I can check into this further.

Cheers

Frank
