[pared down]
Today I'm THRILLED to report that I was able to replace the coolant temperature
sensor and that ALL of the above symptoms disappeared.  Starts right up and runs
right, no surging, no stalling and accelerates smoothly.  AND I got all this for
the $11.32 the dealer charged me for the sensor (and a $1.68 for the new o-ring
seal).
[other stuff gone too]
