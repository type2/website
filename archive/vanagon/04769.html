&gt;All the tires on the van ('84 GL) are BF Goodrich LT 195/75 R14 M+S, and
&gt;not the 185 R14 C7 PR that are called for.
&gt;Now for my questions:
&gt;  Would anyone recommend replacing the one damaged tire?

depends on how worn it was. if over 'half', it might be better to get two
new ones. maybe get a spare wheel from a junkyard and mount the remaining
undamaged old tire on it (for an additional 'spare'). if less than 'half',
it probably wouldn't make much difference as long as it was the same size
and type (radial, etc.) and tread pattern.

&gt;  If I replace two, should I put on 185/75 or get what's on there

since the tires you have on there are light truck tires, check if they are
load range C. if so, that's what is recommended. see what the price is on
the same size. i don't have a good reason, but i'd feel 'funny' about
putting two different widths on a car. yeah, i know that porsche and the
sports car folks do it all the time, but we're talking vanagons here.

&gt;  Lastly, should I put the new ones on the front or back?

if you want to better stopping, put the new ones on the front.
if you want better traction, especially with snowy winter coming up, put
the new ones on the rear.

another alternative: get THREE spare wheels from a junkyard, save the three
remaining undamaged tires as 'spares' and buy four brand new tires of which-
ever size you want. :)  well, you didn't SAY anything about money!
