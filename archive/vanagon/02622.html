&gt; 
&gt; Try NTW or Tires America, they are the same company and that is where 
&gt; I get mine. BTW I'm in eastern PA
&gt; 
&gt; Leo

Unfortunately, none of the phone books I have access to list either NTW
or Tires America.  I'm getting curious about the $60 price, since I called
Sears last night, and they have them for $81.69.  You guys wouldn't have
bought these tires during a &quot;buy 3, get 1 free&quot; sale, did you?
