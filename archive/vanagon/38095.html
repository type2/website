MEGAN,
	I might be a bit rough on the EV because I have and several
problems with camper conversion wiring. I do LOVE my EV. I'll probally
always have a vehical that contains the functions covered by the VW
Camper concept. For the next couple of years my 95 EV-Camper is it.

Just some of my common hints about looking at and dealing with the
VW salesman when you really go to buy it. I hope you do.
1. Make him show you how to do the following:
	a. Start the LP furnace
	b. Start the fridge on LP/Battery/Shoreline
	c. Test the sink...I mean run it for 5 minutes and check plumbing
		for leaks. Mine has one still.
	d. Pop the top and check for holes in canvas. One on the lot
		had been eaten over the winter when I was looking.
	e. Fold down the bed
	f. Have the salesman show you how to put the extra rear seat in.
	g. How to fill the propane tank. Some jerk overfilled mine once and
		I didn't know any better at the time and rode around for
		a week with a 100% full tank. it's only suppost to be 80% full.
	h. Check the cabin battery to make sure it is fully capabile of
		holding a charge.
	i. Test the burners. If you have the Fridge LP gas control knob set
		to the start position then all of your LP gas supply is
		turned off, even to the stove. That one got me.

2. Check the settling joints around 2/3 the way up the windshield on the
	drivers and passengers side for cracks. Most EV's have them. Obligate
	them to make sure it is never a problem to fix in writing.
3. Ask about the Anti-Lock brakes. Check out the replacement parts for these.
	 The control valve that does the anti-locking is like $1000 to replace.
4. Test the sterio for sound. Mine crackles now and again.

Well that is about all for now. If you need any more input I can send you
some of my more drawn out complainst and complements on the EV.

&gt; Megan &quot;the sniveling lurker&quot; : ) said:
&gt; the V-4 seemed OK. (Though rumor has it that a V-6 is in the offing for later
&gt; this year.)
&gt;
&gt; I say:
&gt; Any input Rob??  ; )
