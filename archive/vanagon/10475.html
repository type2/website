Subject: Re: [Q] Decreasing gear ratio
Date: Mon, 23 Jan 95 9:46:32 PST

&gt; 
&gt; I don't remember seeing this discussed anywhere, so does anyone know
&gt; if replacement gears are available for my tranny to lower the revs at 
&gt; 60 mph?  It seems criminal to make that poor engine turn 4000 rpm at 60 
&gt; when the torque at 3000 rpm is probably sufficient for the job.  It's 
&gt; nice to have the real low first gear for jeep roads in the mountains, 
&gt; but in the flats I wind through the gears pretty fast.  The ultimate 
&gt; solution would be a five-speed tranny.  Are there any possibilities 
&gt; here?  Or were the German engineers pretty smart when they designed the
&gt; factory gearing?

  Heres a copy of the now infamous wear index which includes the ratio in 4th
  and the final drive ratio for the gearboxes you might be interested in. 
  Unfortuneatly, the &quot;mountain gears&quot; mentioned in Haynes are not included
  in the wear index.
