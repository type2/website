&gt;there's a graphic on the new &quot;Sharan&quot; at the following location:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.vw-audi.co.at
&gt;
&gt;it sort of looks mainstream, with F-O-R-D written all over it
&gt;(well, I guess it was a VW-Ford collaboration), with touches
&gt;of Honda Oddity tossed in (it's shown w/ a 4-door + hatch setup).
&gt;It's too bad they didn't go w/ the dual sliding rear doors ala
&gt;Chrysler, but, oh well....
&gt;
&gt;On the up side, I hear it's supposed to be available w/ the VR6  :-)
&gt;

Oh my. How are they going to turn this thing into a camper? Wish they gave
the dimensions. Unless the perspective is throwing the dimensions off,
judging by the size of the doors its more of a station wagon than a van. It
looks like they've succumbed to traditional &quot;minivan&quot; marketing. Has anyone
ever seen the &quot;European delivery truck&quot; version of this? (That's what they
supposedly made the EV camper out of.) I did note that they were offering a
diesel engine option as well as a 5 cyl and the VR6. Can anyone translate
the German?
