&gt; &gt;shouldn't run more than $40 new. Early to mid-70's Ford cars have t
his
&gt; &gt;carb, like pinto's, bobcat's mustang and capri. The rebuild kits ar
e about
&gt; &gt;$10, and easy to do. You will need a few new jets though. I'll look

Nope, they used the version manufactured under license by Holley.
The genuine Weber is a much better carb. I ran both versions on Opels, and I
had a Weber on my MGA. The Weber used to cost around $130. That was a
while ago. The Holley was a little cheaper.

&gt; Some problems: The Bus requres a large vacuum port for the power brakes.
&gt; I have seen some plumbing fixtures I may be able to tap the manifold
&gt; and insert. 
That should work fine. 

&gt; The carb has no choke. It was torn out to make a race vehicle. Do I
&gt; need it? Can I find a gummed up or broken weber prog. that had a choke?

Butchers! :-) You won't find one in a yard unless you're really
lucky. You will find Holleys and everything will be different. They
just look the same. You will have to try to buy new parts.

After you have found a source of parts, add up what you need and
decide whether you want to buy parts or a whole new carb all set up
for your application.

Yes, you need a choke. Sounds like you need both the butterfly
and linkage. To operate it, you can get a really long cable or you can
get one that uses coolant (oops no coolant) or an electric one. I'd go
for the electric; my wife prefers a knob on the dash. 

&gt; with single QP extractor? How much do jets cost? I need lots of torque
&gt; for the Bus.

The jets are $5-$8 or so apiece. I used to order stuff from Bayless
Racing, Inc. in uh? Atlanta? I forget. Look for their ad in Road&amp;Track
or ask a FIAT buff. They specialize in FIAT and Alfa parts. Also try
PAECO. I can try to find addresses for you when I get home. There are
probably VW houses that carry the parts, but I've only owned my VW
for a few weeks.

The progressive Weber is a great carb; I would be tempted to use one
but it would violate smog regs here.

&gt; Overhead clearance is an issue for the Bus. I have only about 4 inch

You can get cute little chrome aircleaners for the Weber that are
low profile. 4&quot; is plenty.
