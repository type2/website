&gt; Martha...here's another one for the trip....sort of appropriate,
&gt; depending on the route...
&gt; 
&gt; Movin' to Montana   ... the late, great, Frank Zappa
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Is that a real pancho...or is that a Sears pancho?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Would a pre-1980s VW Van be considered &quot;liquidly challenged&quot;?

Hey Ric,

Why don't you suggest Dinah Mo Humm too.  I'm sure Martha would
really like that one.  ;)
