Subject: Diesel Vanagon conversion project update.

Well, I got the gas engine out of the donor car (86 Golf) on Sunday.
Only took about 3 hours from start to finish. Liberal use of a hammer and
pry-bar helped. :)

I have updated my website as well. Be warned though, I have not compressed
the images! A few are approx 100k! Look at:
