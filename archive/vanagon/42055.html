&gt; Has anyone else had this problem (or ideas/comments)? Shouldn't the             
&gt; compressor make a bit of noise? Should I wait until the compressor fails?       

the compressors on my '85 and on the '87 are both loud.  also seem to 
absorb too much energy IMHO.  i thought i was going to have to 
replace the '85's (it was really loud) but it kept on cooling and 
never failed.

i have a compressor from an '84 that Gerry Skerbitz gave me and that 
one is loud too 'cause it's still rolling around in the trunk of my 
car.   :)
