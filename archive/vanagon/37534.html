Hello All,

It looks like we've got the ball rolling for a camping trip on the East 
Coast, at French Creek State Park in Pennsylvania (just west of Pottstown 
in the eastern half of the state).
The date so far is the weekend of April 19, 20, and 21.

I know there are nine of us on the list in eastern PA, and many more in 
the surrounding areas. Please email me and let me know your interest, 
suggestions, etc.

Man, it's about time this winter ended and we got outdoors for some 
camping activity!

Thanks,
Dave
