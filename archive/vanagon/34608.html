&gt; *Plus* bottom right corner of the windshield :) You wanna see the
&gt; affiliation both ways, when passing *and* when coming from the opposite
&gt; direction. (This would also generate extra demand for the stickers and
&gt; please Richard, right?)

Bottom right won't work here in Colorado unless that's from the driver's 
seat.  That's where the smog sticker goes.  The cops would probably 
think I was trying to cover up an expired sticker and pull me every 
chance they got.

I'm voting for front window, top dead center and lower left rear window.
