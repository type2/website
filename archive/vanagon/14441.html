Subject: Re: Canadian '78 Muffler Prices?

&gt;Does anyone know of any sources for reasonably priced exhaust/mufflers 
&gt;for the 78 Vans? 



I've bought real cheapos: Thunderbird! $75, burnt out &lt; 2 years, tried a 
Monza 4 tip system $150, good quality, 3 years old when I sold the beast. 
Tried JC Whitless? Most speed 'n custom shops carry catalogues and will 
order. Isn't there a place called Ron's (VW) Parts in Vancouver that 
advertises in HVW etc?  A lifetime warranty from Midas may be worth it, 
IMHO, since replacing every 4 years gets costly.  tim s.
