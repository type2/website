&gt; I beleave that you need water in the tank for it to work...at least that
&gt; is how my '83 works,  and boy did it have me scared the first time that 
&gt; happened.  There should be no problem finding a summersible water 
&gt; pump in any camping store
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;          or even in a Walmart.
