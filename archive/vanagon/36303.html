&gt; What is  a reasonable price to pay for a '65 split window, good body
&gt; condition - no rust, no interior, good rebuilt motor?

What model?  Panel? Kombi? Standard? Deluxe? Ambulance? SIngle Cab? Double
Cab? Wide Body Single cab? Fire Bus?

The model makes a big difference.

Where are you?  Location is important, too.  Rust free kombi's in California
are a dime a dozen.  In Minnesota they're unheard of.  

Deluxe's and standard's get a premium.  Panels go up or down.  An ambulance
would be _the_ticket_!
