Subject: Weber setup on a '73 bus...

Hi all,

It took my about two months to  realize that the Weber &amp; 009 distr.
setup requires totally different timing settings as the values per
Muir's and that had been the cause of my '73 bus misfiring and
suffering... (yeah... a novice learning the hard way...). Now, my bus
is not misfiring anymore, but it seems that my Weber setup is not
behaving too well... when i try to accelerate, the engine has a lot of
trouble picking up rpms, specially when the engine is cold. The
symptom is very much like Muirs diagnosis of a clugged heat riser:
&quot;... a period of hesitation after you've pushed down on the
accelerator to speed up the car...&quot;. The only thing is that, as far as
i know, the '73 1700cc engine doesn't have a heat riser... I did make
sure that the engine had been tuned and the accelerator pump was
working. Any hints on this?? I've heard of a device that could be
attached to the carburator to provide additional heating... can anyone 
expand on this as to where to obtain it and how helpful it is??

Thanks in advance!

-Jose A.
