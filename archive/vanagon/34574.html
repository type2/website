Subject: shift box for syncro


When my local 'ASE' certified mech. replaced my tranny on my 87 syncro, he 
had to replace a piece of the shift linkage in an attempt to get the shift 
pattern to work (reverse was way left, hitting my gas pedal knee and very 
hard to get into first).  The new piece of linkage helped some:  the pattern 
is tighter, but still way left and first is not quite as difficult to 
engage.  The mech. said the shift box also needs replaced.  Problem is he 
cannot locate one.  Tischer VW in Laurel, MD said that the units are MFG. in 
Germany and are out of production.  Does anybody have any experience with 
this part?  Also,  what would alternate sources of a fairly low mi. box be 
to go with the new tranny/linkage?

Thanks,
Fred Porter
