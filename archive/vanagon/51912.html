Subject: Cupholders and Walmart

To the list,

	Sorry I wasn't specific as to my posting about OEM style cupholders and
Wal-Mart. A few listmembers keyed in to the fact that I was joking,
which is primaraly true. But actually there was a hidden issue that I
don't think anyone touched on.

	On friday news reports announced that Wal-Mart has forced the music
industry to censor their products, edit for content and edit cover art
that Wal-Mart management feels offensive. They think can do this due to
the volume of music they sell in their stores. The figure I saw was
around 8.5% of the industry sales. Wal-Mart banned the sale of Alanis
Morresette's (sp.) new CD because of lyrics that said people buy guns
over the counter at Wal-Mart, without restrictions, and commit crimes.
(Also a company spokesperson claimed during that situtation that
Wal-Mart didn't sell guns in their retail stores, only by mail order...
not true!)

	I'm not very political but when I started to see the postings about
cupholders on the list I suddenly lost control and went nuts. Sorry for
the non-VW content. I'm not even going to go into what I think of the
above situtation, I just wanted to explain my orginal posting.

Erik
