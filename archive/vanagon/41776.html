Subject:  Value of Spec 76 Type II? 

I've seen a lot of van for sale postings lately, and am wondering what mine
is worth. I'd like to get it insured for more than the $12.95 that
the insurance company thinks a 20 year old VW is worth;-) 
It is a 1976 2litre FI Type II. Not a westie, but a 7 passenger 
version. Regarding condition, it is stock, basically at factory spec, with
50K easy miles.* Original paint except passenger door was
repainted when it was scraped in a parking lot in 1978. Original tires!!!! 
No rust except a few stone chips on the nose with what a friend calls 'Rain 
Rust'. It was only driven in the summer, on holiday trips for 11 of its first
17 years, and then on blocks for 6 years. I've put about 3K summer miles on it
a year. It has been oil sprayed, and may have originally been undercoated. 
Has gas heater that works fine. My mechanic's view of its condition is
&quot;perfect, just perfect&quot;.

Engine repairs done to date: New exhaust parts. New fuel injectors.

Any estimates? Anyone know where I could get it appraised for insurance
purposes? Please e-mail as well, as I only see first 30K of the digest.

Thanks Bill Crick
