Subject: Re: Here's Netscape Source!

Christian asked where to get Netscape so that he could look at the
*VOLKSWAGEN* related web pages. (Sorry but I had to make it VW related).
This source also has plenty of graphics and webtools from everything from
Mac to Xservers. Even the Computer-Techie-Vwfolks need to check this one
out. Now back to VW talk...

original search keyword: &lt; modem software &gt;
Web Address:   http:/www.valdosta.peachnet_dot_edu/vsu/download/vwppp/

Good luck!

&gt;Help, I need to get either Netscape or Mosaic.  Where do I find netscape?
&gt;Can I ftp this?  TIA
