The primary difference in around town driving and freeway driving is air flow
through the radiator.  At freeway speeds there is plenty of &quot;free&quot; airflow.
 Around town the fan must function properly to flow enough air through the
radiator to cool the coolant.  It sounds to me like the problem lies with
your radiator fan not functioing properly.

Good luck,
