They're really annoying, actually, as all you get is odors from the
engine compartment, but no useful heat.

It's a '66 bus, with a '71 engine.  The muffler is weird, in that the
flexible part of the heat riser tube is on the right instead of the
left.  The damper pipe is a simple L -- I didn't see an option for any
other type in the RMMW catalog, which is where I ordered my exhaust
system from.  It can't be pointed down, because it's completely inside
the body of the bumper (see side view below).

I don't have the tailpipe connected, as it would have to go through
the bumper mount.  I proved to myself last night that the exhaust I'm
smelling is definitely fresh exhaust being routed around to the air
intakes by the curve of the bumper.

For now, my plan is to live without a bumper.  For the longer term, I
plan on finding pictures appropriate to my model year, and figuring
out what the exhaust and bumper should look like.  I have no reason to
believe that the bumper is correct, either.

Cut-away view from the left, looking right, down the inside of the
bumper:
