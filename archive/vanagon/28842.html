Subject: Re: Trans Fluid Change questions

I did it snake-style on the ground. Good workout!
&gt;     Weather has turned to winter here, and I have no garage and will
&gt;     be working on the ground outside, and want to be as prepared
&gt;     as possible. So inquiring minds want to know:
&gt;
&gt;     What weight did you use?
I used Red Line MTL 75W/80W
&gt;     Did you need a pump to get the fluid up in there?
I bought a cheapie pump for about $6
&gt;
&gt;     The Bentley diagram may be mislabled: is there a fill
&gt;     point up high on one end, and the drain on the other?
The fill plug is on the passenger side--you can easily see it from the side
of the van by peering through the wheel well. The drain plug is at the
bottom back end of the tranny and is obscured by some of the syncro's skid
plate. Use a big pan to catch the used oil as it drains via the skid plate.
&gt;
&gt;     What did you use to open them up, a 17mm allen wrench, or
&gt;     did you use the 17mm bolt trick, in which case, how long a bolt?
For the fill plug, I used a 17mm allen 'socket' for a 1/4&quot; drive ratchet
(small one). For the drain plug I used the same allen 'socket', but had to
use a 17 mm open-end wrench to turn it. No room for a ratchet. I couldn't
have removed either plug without the 17mm allen thing.

Next step is to do the front differential...
