Subject: deep-cycle batteries for Vanagon

My Vanagon came with a deep-cycle gelled electrolyte battery that actually
fits nicely in the unmodified battery comparment. Unfortunately, I think
the battery is no longer manufactured in this size. The batterly was
manufactured by Sonnenschein (German import) and is model Prevailer DF75. I
did some research and learned that Sonnenschein was purchased by a US
company, East Penn Manufacturing Company Inc. Apparently, East Penn
discontinued manufacture of the European-sized batteries. If anyone wants
to research this further with East Penn, their phone number is
610.682.6361.
