Subject: Anyone have a Eurovan Diesel?
Date: Mon, 20 Feb 95 11:43:00 EST


I'm interested in hearing from anyone who owns or has driven one of these. 
 I'm considering the diesel over the gas version, mainly because of its fuel 
economy (I realize air isn't available in the diesels).  How reliable is the 
2.4 5-cylinder?  (my '92 Turbo Diesel Jetta has been wonderful, but I only 
have 96k on it).  I couldn't care less about HP, as long as I can 
*eventually* get up to highway speed limit.  Anyone driven one of these 
through the Rockies?
