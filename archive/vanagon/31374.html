     I am slowly transplanting my engine for a newer one, and I was 
     wondering if it would be good to paint the heater boxes so they don't 
     rust out.  Mine are in pretty good shape now and I'd like to keep them 
     that way.
     
     Would painting with POR-15 be a good idea ?

I tried the cheap fix which consisted of wrapping aluminum tape around the 
boxes. This didn't last too long (4 days/2,000 miles). A better fix is to 
take them to a welder, who will charge you perhaps between $10 and $40 
depending on how hard it is to reach into the corners and how hard it is 
to build up on the rust. Afterwards paint the tin with POR-15 
paint-over-rust paint. In my case, it was worth it, because even junk yard 
quality, badly rusted and perforated &quot;type 4&quot; boxes go for $150 a pair 
here in the rust belt.
