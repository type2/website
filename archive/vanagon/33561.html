Subject: Re: Engine Plug

Let me wax poetic about a &quot;plug&quot; in the 2.0L engine casing that can fall/wiggle
out for no apparent reason, thereby causing oil to spew out on the ground and
threaten to fry one's engine in no time flat if one does not instantly shut off
one's engine, which fortunately I did. 

Ahem...

#$_at_*&amp;%#$_at_*&amp;%#$_at_*&amp;%#$_at_*&amp;%!!!!!

Thank you for your time. 

If someone can give me the reason for the existance of this time-bomb, I'd be
forever grateful.
