&lt;&lt; Also mysterious to me is in the dash, just under the glove compartment, is
 a plug which looks like a stereo input jack - the big kind - except it's
not.
 1/2 inch silver rim. Also connected to some wires which get lost in the
tangle.
 Any ideas on this one? &gt;&gt;

This thread will never die, will it?  What, 2, 3 years now?

Katherine - this is a 12 Volt power socket that Westfalia installed for
goodies/accessories using this type of plug.  Amost every Westy 76-91 I've
seen has one.  Just finding the accessories with the plug is another
mysterious matter.  You can get the replacement socket (and the male ends) at
a place in Arizona called The Trim Shop (specializes in Type 181 Thing parts,
which also used &quot;The Silver Socket&quot;)

PS:  Oh - the little button on the Handbrake activates the Brake Warning
Light when the Handbrake is in use - push the button (which happens when
releasing the Handbrake) and the light goes out.
