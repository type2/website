Subject: '78 Westy questions (Newbie)


Hello all!

First, I would like to say thanks to all of you and the priceless
information you have already given me while looking for my bus.  I have been
subscribing for a while now, and all the tips helped.  

I have wanted a Westy for a couple of years (a college buddy had a cool one)
and have been actively pursuing one for a couple of months now.  Last night,
I finally found the right bus (even though it was more cash than I was going
to spend).  A puke eggnog light brown Westy in great shape.  No rust, no
major structural, my local shop inspected it and said it just needed an air
filter, and it was only on its second owner.  For only a hair over $3000, it
seemd like a fair deal (at least here in Western Washington).  

BUT, even though I have another VW (it's newer) and I used to know people
with buses, I have some incredibly DUMB QUESTIONS...

1. How do I light the pilot for the icebox? (yeah, start laughin')

2. The PO had a propane aux. heater in the bus, but he took it.  Should I
replace it with a like one, or is a gasoline heater better/worse?  (I have
seen these mentioned here on the digest...)

3. Lastly, (awaiting a roar of laughter) can I put unleaded fuel in this
thing?  Back in the '70s, I was under the impression that nearly everything
ran on leaded, and it's tough to find around here.  *Some Mechanic Guy* told
me that if I did not put leaded gas through it, the valves would suffer.  Is
that true, or is it solely actane related?

Anyways, Thanks in advance.
