Subject: need advice on aux. circuit, '87 Vanagon



Well,
now that the winter's here, the 87 is keeping me busy.  This Friday, I
lost power to all Aux. circuit, including the defroster fan.  I traced
the harness and teh wiring (without a manual) and the aux. wire that
leaves from the back of the fuse box to the fan, radio, etc.. is good.
The fuse itself is good.  I supposed it's one of the relays on the
fuse box assembly that's gone bad -- or maybe the internal connection
ibn the fuse box assembly that carries power from the fuse to the
aux. circuit wire.  I'd appreciate it if someone (assuming there is
such a thing) could fax me the fuse box assembly circuit drawings
(gif/jpeg images are fine, too).

For now, I've got the aux. circuit hot wired :-(

Thanks,
Cetin
