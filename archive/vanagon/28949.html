Didn't Pink Floyd write a song about us EuroVan drivers called
&quot;Comfortably Warm&quot;? 


Do you know the difference between a EuroVan driver and a BayWindow
driver....

A Bay Window driver has to keep the windows closed to keep the
heat in....A EuroVan driver has to open the windows to let the
heat out!!


Warmly yours (and loving it.....)    8-)
