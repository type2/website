Mark,
I've want to talk with you about your putting the M-codes that
appeared in OBR on your web page. A lot of effort was spent in finding
all those numbers, translating from the original German, proofreading,
double-checking, etc. Everything that is published in NEATO is
copyrighted, unless the author says it's OK to reprint somewhere else.

We send copies of the newsletter as free samples to anyone who asks, and,
in fact, I have a fair number of copies of the issue that has the
M-mumbers article in it. I would like it you you did not post on your web
page any further material from the Old Bus Review newsletter. Club
members devote much time to make this organization work. The same
reasoning here is in effect when non-members are not allowed to use the
Transporter Tourist &amp; Traveler Directory. No one is paid for any of this,
yet it does take money, effort, and a sense of community to make all of
this happen.It feels unfair that the material is offered to non-members
who give nothing back to the community.

I would be happy to discuss this further with you.
