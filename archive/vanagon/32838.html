Subject: RE: Much mail


&gt;I would like to second Dan's comments, I am finding the amount of
&gt; traffic a little overwhelming.
&gt;
&gt;I am more than a little overwhelmed with the amount of mail I am recieving
&gt;from the vanagon list - 140 pieces this morning.

That's why God made subject lines and Delete keys, and gave you
thumbs to use them.


&gt;Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to 
a
&gt;couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
&gt;windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?

Great idea! List admin is a real pain (just ask Gerry), but now that you've
volunteered.... let me know when you have it ready, and I'll be the first to
sign on!
