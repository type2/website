Subject: Wear Index

The other day someone suggested that a Vanagon Diesel could deliver 200,000
miles or more between overhauls. I have yet to meet anyone who has squeezed
even 100,000 out of one of these hard working units. This started me thinking
about compiling a wear index -  Engine revolutions per mile in top gear x stroke
of the engine - giving the linear distance travelled by a piston and rings per
mile. I agree this is very crude and probably not an accurate predictor of
engine life, but it would give us something to talk about for a day or two...

I have the top gear ratios, final drive ratios and engine strokes for the 
'68 - 79 buses in my Bentley manual. What I would need is similar information
on Vanagons of all flavors, the EV and microbuses. On the microbus, I would also
need the axle reduction gearbox ratio. I'll do the arithmetic and post the
results if some of you could provide the above info.

Thanks!
