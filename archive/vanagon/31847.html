Subject: Where can I get one? (was Hookup for vacuum advance)

&gt;I have a 34PICT3 carb and 009 distributor. I want to trade out for the
&gt;vacuum advanced distributor that was intended for the '71/34pict setup.
&gt;Can someone please inform me regarding the setup for the vacuum lines?
&gt;There are four vacuum (two with tubes; two without) outlets on the carb and
&gt;only one on the distributor.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe
&gt;

I have recently rebuilt my 34pict3 and need a vacuum advanced distributor,
as it has been suggested that a 009 doesn't really work well with the
34pict3 in the bus... where can you pick one up these days, and what type
am I looking for?

Very anxious here,

J89...
