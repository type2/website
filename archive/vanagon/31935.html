------- start of forwarded message (RFC 934 encapsulation) -------

&gt; &gt;Click and Clack (the Car Talk guys) railed on a woman about the dangers
&gt; &gt;of driving her '76 Westy (tippy, no side impact protection -- suggested
&gt; &gt;she wear a footbal helmet).  Anyway, I've heard that the Vanagons are quite
&gt; &gt;safe.  Does anyone have real stats on this?  Vehicle deaths per mile?
&gt; &gt;Or Insurance company type of data?

&gt; Interesting,  I once heard them advise a young kid to get an old bus 
&gt; because: A) last forever B) so cheap to fix, and if it broke, C) you 
&gt; could just throw it away and get another, and lastly D) girls like 
&gt; it

I listened to that show.  They said that the guy would never get it
completely fixed, but that was O.K., 'cause they are never completely
broken, either -- they're always in between...
