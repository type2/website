I think it's Somebody's Theory that if you make a chain from person
X to person Y in the USA by FOAFOAFOAFOAF...  then actually you can
always connect any two people by a chain no longer than:
FOAFOAFOAF

The nice thing about this theory is that there's no proving it (or
disproving it) so you can believe it as part of the growing VW
True Faith and Mystic Revelation Cult that seems to be springing up....
