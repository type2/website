Subject: Passing It On...

 1974 Bus for sale
~~MUST GO!!!~~
NO rust
Green/White top
Has Bug engine and adapter&lt;--needs to be installed.
$300 OBO

Kid's going off to California (shoulda brought his Bus, in my opinion...)
but...he wants to sell it, and his parents are buggin' him to get it out of
their driveway. The guy's name is Troy, and his phone # is: (508) 995-7775
 That's in Dartmouth, Mass.

That's all I know! He saw me settin' in my camper the other day and give me
the info. I said I'd pass it along and he's cool with me posting his # on the
ole InfoHighway!!!
