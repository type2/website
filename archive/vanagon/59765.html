Subject: Re: '87 has noisy lifter

Kathy,

You might want to change to synthetic oil.  It flows better than dino
and tends to quiet lifters.  The only time I hear my lifters is on the
startup after an oil change.

&gt; Mark,
&gt;         I'm a fairly new owner of an '87 Westy.  The first time it did that
&gt; to me, I started driving it immediately to my mechanic.  Then it stopped,
&gt; so I turned around, went home and called them instead.  They told me that
&gt; this was not uncommon when it sits for awhile and to basically not worry
&gt; about it.  It hurts my ears, though, and I have to wonder if its not so
&gt; good for the engine.
&gt; If anyone else has comments about this, WE would appreciate hearing them.

&gt; &gt;The 2.1l in my 87 syncro has a noisy lifter. When the vehicle sits for a few
&gt; &gt;days (I drive it about every 3 days or so) the lifter ticks for a couple of
&gt; &gt;minutes and then quiets down. Today the lifter ticked loudly until the oil
&gt; &gt;got up to operating temperature (~180F), then it quieted down like always.
&gt; &gt;I'm using Mobil 1 synthetic15W50 oil (and have been for over a year now).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What should/can I do about this?
