        You might try working on (or replaceing) the switch first.  I got
tired of the heater fan not running reliably also, so last friday night (in
a parking lot)I removed the switch, took it apart and cleaned and adjusted
the contacts.

        To get the switch out I first removed the dash ashtray (I don't
remember why except that you can see the switch with it removed).  Then I
slid the heater controls most of the way to the left.  I then pulled out the
fan controll selector (it's a T shaped piece of plastis, it just pulls
straight out).  And then carefully pried on the right side of the heater
control face.  There is a spring clip on the right side of the now exposed
switch pot(now I remember about the ashtray, I was at this point able to
push on the back of the switch to get it out.  It then just unplugs.

        If you are of the mind to disassemble the switch, there are a couple
of plastic tabs on the side that when pressed will allow the switch to be
taken apart.  After takeing it apart clean all the contacts with alcohol and
a green pad(3M scotchbrite or equivilant) then try the switch.  If it works,
good, if not...  take it apart again (you may break it durring this step,
but it needed replacement anyways, so nothing is lost by trying).  I noticed
that post was worn so I bent the ears back just a little so that the ears
would not hold the post away from it's contact point.  I had to chip away at
the plastic inside the switch a little so the the now adjusted ears could
move freely.

        My heater fan works again!
