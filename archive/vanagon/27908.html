It was a dark and stormy night......

Well, not really stormy but it did rain most of the day here.
Four people driving four busses showed up:

Richard Palmer	'67 Standard
Gary Clayton	'76 Camper
John Rottet	'78 Camper
David Most	'79 Camper

I got my Tshirt from Richard.  I understand the praise I read here for them
- can't wait to wear it!
David showed us the EPA/US Gov. paperwork he had to get to register his bus
in the US after buying it in Canada.
It has a gas heater that he hopes to get running.
I showed off the 3/4 inch pvc pipe I cut to hold a tarp on the rain gutter
of the bus.  I ran with this idea after it came up here on the mailing list
and have worked out a good system - I hope to do a WWW page with pics on how
to make one.
John showed us his tie-dyed ceiling panels - he sprayed adhesive, then
attached dyed fabric to them - very cool.
Richard gave us the history of the 6 or so busses he has owned.

In the vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu tradition we shared pizza and beer at
Satisfaction Restaurant.  On the wall beside our table was the rear (from
the top of the rear window back) of a VW beetle.  We guessed that is was
parts from several different years.  They also have the front ends of 2
beetles.

I imagine the weather had something to do with more of you NC people showing
up.  We'll shoot for another get-together in early Dec. when
the 2nd edition Tshirts are ready.
