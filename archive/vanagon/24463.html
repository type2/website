Subject: '80 Vanagon for sale or parts, bay area (CA)

Well... I didn't think I'd see the day that I'd own a late model vehicle, 
but I do now.  There was a '72 and '77 bus that someone had that looked 
nice, and so I made a bulk deal that included an '80 Vanagon.  I'd like 
to get rid of it so I can score some more prunes.  Also, I'm not really 
a type IV engine kinda person, nor FI.  $700 obo, read on if ya want.  :)

It's running, but the body is kinda beat up.  It has an unknown pop-top 
that is 3/4 length, and pops straight up, has yellow rain coat looking 
fabric that is shreded in a corner.  Interior is ratty, icebox (ice only, 
no power), 2 burner stove (tank is rusted), and a fold out bed.  The 
exterior has a home paint job (runs), left front corner by headlight is 
mashed, so drivers door is not so good.  And the rear hatch has a dent in it.

That's most of the bad stuff (I like starting off positive).  The good 
stuff is... it has two nice front seats (brown), and the passenger has 
the rotating base.  All the glass is good, and Tranny is good.  The 
engine runs, but it's real weak feeling.  It smells rich, but with no oil 
smell, so might be something simple (I don't know FI).

It has current registration until September 20, '95.  I would like to 
sell it as a whole parts vehicle in the next couple days.  Otherwise I 
will part it out.  So if anyone wants to drive it Email me ASAP.  
Otherwise I'll part it out (most of the parts have been 
requested by people).  I don't think the body is very good... so I prefer 
selling it for parts.  If I cut it up all body panels are free.

That guy that told me about his '68 never came back...but I'll tell y'all 
if he does.
