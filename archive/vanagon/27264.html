Subject: Phone number for VW dealer

Someone posted the 800 number for a deal that they said had good prices 
and a deal for internet folks.  But I seem to have deleted it.  

I need it so I can check their price on the rubber filler thing.  One 
dealer here said $15 for 211 201 119.  Another dealer parts guy knew the 
part number by heart, and said 211 201 119 A with the duck bill inside, 
and was $54.  And they both said they need to order it.
