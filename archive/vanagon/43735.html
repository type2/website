&gt;Hi all,
&gt;	Where is a good place to put the jack stands, besides right
&gt;next to where the jack goes?  I played around a little bit with it
&gt;this weekend, placed them in one spot that made a bad sound while
&gt;SLOWLY lowering the bottle jack.
&gt;
I put mine under the axle beam and torsion tubes.  I figure these areas
are &quot;used&quot; to holding up the bus.  :-)
