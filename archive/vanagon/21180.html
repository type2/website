Subject: Re: Parts/Service in Minneapolis?

  You can try J.A.C. Auto Repair &amp; Sales in Ramsey, MN, just NW of
Minneapolis.  The number is (612) 421-2705.  The owner is in the Twin Cities
Volkswagen Club.

  You can also try Metric Auto Parts.  There are about three stores in the
Twin Cities area.

  Hope these help.
