I've seen it happen, at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Southern Cal.  One
night FreeFall (the ride where you drop straight down for like 20 stories)
lost power when four people were up at the top of the tower.  They were up
there ready to drop with only two small metal pins waiting to be released
for their car to drop.  Took them close to 10 minutes to get the power back
on.  I could hear the people at the top of the tower screaming for help
near the end - I was at the front of the line.  Good thing they were locked
in a cage - would have been bad if they panicked and jumped or something.
*whew*  :)  I still love that ride, though...
