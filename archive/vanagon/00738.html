Subject: Re: 2nd antenna

Actually, the 2nd antenna I bought at the VW dealer. Then I sent it in to
STICO and told them to make sure it could handle 100 watts output at my car
alarm frequency of 27.195. They did the mod, so now if someone breaks into my
car in manhattan, my beeper goes off in my apartment and I can run down to
the street in my night gown and a stick. 

Then, when I run up to the van and 15 ugly guys are ripping it off I...I...

...what do I do then?
