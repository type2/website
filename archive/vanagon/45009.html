&lt;&lt; Hi, I'm still fiddling (probably out of paranoia) with worries on my 
 new engine wasserboxer. AFTER replacing the '86 Westy's 2.1 engine last 
 year, the local Dallas dealership needed to replace both heads last 
 month because of water leaks. The new head work was under warrenty, but 
 now I'm hearing a ticking noise at idle. It's loudest when first 
 starting up, after sitting a little while. The dealership looked at it 
 and then readjusted the lifters and replaced the ones on the driver's 
 side. The noise is still there. Should I be concerned?? It runs great 
 except for this noise. I don't beleive it used to make this noise 
 before the heads were replaced.
 
 Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. Not only the cause, 
 but what you think I should tell the dealer (if necessary).
 
  Thanks!  Vance

Are you sure the ticking noise is not an exhaust leak?  Check all connections
carefully.
