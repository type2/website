Subject: Re: Please help with carb, timing, &amp; idle!

&gt;Martin,
&gt;
&gt;I want to thank you for all your help with getting this timing stuff right.
&gt;I was able to time the engine correctly and now need to tweak a few
&gt;things...
&gt;
&gt;I rebuilt the carb and it seems to be a little better...I will be testing
&gt;for leasks today...I sent another SOS to the groups, as I have now a &quot;flat&quot;
&gt;spot in my acceleration...if you have any insight, please let me know...
&gt;
&gt;Hope you have a great New Year,
&gt;
&gt;Johnny
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Yes, I know about the flat spot...I had a 009 dist. and it had the same
 problem.  Some guys love them, and I understand that on a bug they are
 great but on a bus my experience has been that the stock gives a much
 smoother power curve with no flat spot off the line.  I tried every kind
 of timing, carb adj. but I never could take off at a start with the 009
 without a bit of nose dive unless I really reved her up and popped the 
 clutch (not good).
