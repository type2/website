Subject: Re: rec.autos.vw call for votes

We should discuss this....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi folks -
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to butt in, but if there is anyone out there that reads rec.autos.vw  
&gt;(the Usenet news group) on a regular basis, I thought you'd want to know that  
&gt;the &quot;CFV&quot; (call for votes) for the proposed re-organization of that group will  
&gt;officially start on or near June 27.
&gt;
&gt;If passed, the re-org will split the group into two groups, one for aircooled  
&gt;VW's and one for watercooled VW's.  That's right, a news group dedicated to  
&gt;aircooled VW's!  If you are interested in supporting this, keep your eyes out  
&gt;for the CFV which will be posted to this mailing list as well as rec.autos.vw  
&gt;and the VINTAGVW list, and be sure to vote.  Instructions for voting will be  
&gt;included in the CFV.

It seems to me that the van/bus owners have much more in common than their
motors. For us vanagon types it will mean having to make cross-postings to
both AC &amp; WC in rec.autos. 

A division similar to that used for repair manuals i.e.&quot;VW Vanagon
1980-1991&quot; would work as well and allow for the AC &amp; WC types to live in
the same space - thereby preserving continuity of VW lore, expertise, and
evolution.

&gt;If you have any questions, please send me mail directly at randy_at_id_dot_com
&gt;

What think you all? There is probably enough people on this list to have a
significant swing vote.
