Subject: Re: About synthetic coils


&gt;I don't think these are a good idea.  In fact, I doubt they'll even work.
&gt; Find yourself halfway to La Paz and your synthentic coil goes out and
&gt;whatcha going to do?

I agree wholeheartedly. The natural-grown ones, without preservatives,
are much more reliable, less filling, taste great.
