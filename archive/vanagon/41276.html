Subject: RE: Governors (i.e.-rev limiters)



i don't know the last year that rev limiters were offered but i _guess_ it was 
67' these doodads sit right below the carb. i dunno much of how they work other 
than they were designed to prevent you from overrevving the engine. i get the 
feeling that back in the 60's or 70's  that nobody payed  much heed to 
overrevving the engine and simply removed the governor and pitched them

as i recall thom fitzpatrick was rebuilding a governpr to put on his 56'? thom 
care to share any light?
