Subject: Help!: Aux A/C evaporator &amp; R-134a conversion?

Sometime last year someone posted a note describing the addition of an
auxiliary  AC evaporator unit behind the glove box of a Vanagon,
replacement of the AC compressor with a larger capacity compressor, and the
conversion to R-134a refrigerant.  I remember the details but I just can't
remember their name and I can't find the post in the archives.  My AC
compressor leaks, some of my refrigerant hoses leak, and it gets awfully
hot in the front of the van so now would be an opportune time to make this
modification.

I would like to discuss some of the details of the aux evaporator
installation with the person that wrote the note so if the author would
e-mail me directly (to save bandwidth) I would be thankful.

Thanks,
Ed McLean
