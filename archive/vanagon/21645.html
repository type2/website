Subject: Grumpy update to '81 Westy project


Here it is. My GRUMPY update to the '81 Westy project. This has been a
real exercise in frustration. The rebuilt engine is here from 
California. The new 1 piece muffler is here. But the heat exchangers, 
_at_#^%^% heat exchangers. We tried to get used ones. The people from CA 
we got the rebuilt from UPSed a pair of used ones. UPS lost them. So 
the folks at AVP were nice enough to scrounge up another pair. They 
sent them next day air. UPS screwed me again. Supposed to be here on 
saturday, didn't get here till monday. Horray! Heat exchangers at last
:-). OH _at_#^&amp;. Wrong heat exchangers. Seems CA cars use different ones 
and AVP forgot about that fact. They could only find 1 that would 
work. So now I have to get new ones. None available locally. Well, 
time to let my fingers do the walking through the 800 numbers. Locate 
a pair. Pay the extra $35 for 2nd day air. They get here today. Horray
again! _at_#^&amp; again. Only one in the box and it's slightly damaged. &quot;The
other one is coming from our warehouse in NJ&quot; he says. You should be 
able to bend it back into shape very easily, he says. Rats... Well I 
hope he's right. Bob's gonna look at it as soon as he gets home. Hope 
the other one gets here soon. Boy am I frustrated. We want to drop the
engine in this weekend to go on vacation next week. Say a prayer to 
the god of VW parts that we get the stuff soon. And that we can 
survive the 95+ degree heat and humidity this weekend and get the job 
done. Will keep ya posted on the results.
