Subject:      moving west - advice?

Well after literally years of problems in my attempts to move west, I'm
finally planning on leaving the 2nd week of September! I'll be traveling
with my girlfriend and dog in my 82 diesel westy.
I was wondering if anyone had any advice as far as things to see, do,
stay, etc... along the way.  We'll be leaving Cape Cod, traveling south  to
Tennessee to visit her parents and then from there its still up in the
air.  Our final destination is even ambiguous, probably the southwest,
but perhaps CA.
I've never been on such a long road trip before, in fact the farhest Ive
driven has been southern CT!! The van should be in good running shape
when we leave, but it would be good to know the names of any reputable VW
shops along the way, as well as any generous listees who could possibly
lend a hand, in case the unthinkable should happen! :)
We're in no rush to get wherever we land so anything is an option...
thanks
