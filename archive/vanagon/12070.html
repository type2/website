Subject:       receiver/dryers

David Kao asks:
&gt; Is there a way to dry it instead of replacing it? What's the material
&gt; inside the dryer? How about bake it (low heat of course) in an oven?

Another function of the receiver/dryer to accumulate and hold 
impurities.  Unless the cost is outrageous, replacing it isn't a bad 
thing to do.  A generic one would be fine if the fittings matched 
up...  Anyone have experience with these?

I don't know about slow-baking them.  The dry heat does re-charge 
most dessicants but with the cost of freon/AC service, is it worth 
the gamble?  If the drier ISN'T rejuvenated, you're looking at a hefty 
re-charge bill... might've paid for the new receiver/drier!

oh, BTW.  A nice trick in examining the sight glass on the '85 
(mounted in the drivers front wheel-well) is to use a small mirror 
and a flashlight.  Hold the mirror above the sight glass and shine 
the flashlight at the *mirror*.  The light will illuminate the sight 
glass and then you can see if the bubbles are still there when 
recharging.
