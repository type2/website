As they say on the Red Green show.

            &quot;Remember, any tool can be the right tool&quot;

Yes, per request, I will summarize all responses to my earlier post about
&quot;Uncomfortable Weekender Package&quot;.  Also included will be all the responses I
got concerning the screen for the window question.  I'll wait till early next
week when the volumn of responses dies down, and cover a summary then.

'89 Syncro
Ch

p.s.   For Syncro owners.  I just paid $3 apiece for front wheel seals.  Even
Bill at Bus Boys wanted to know where I got them so inexpensive.  If you want
to know, e-mail me and I'll send the info.  I haven't checked to see if they
are correct yet, but as soon as the front comes apart in a week or two, I'll
double check to make sure.
