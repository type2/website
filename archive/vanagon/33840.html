&gt;&gt; I won't have any truck with a Type IV

&gt; The Type IV engine, used in 1972-1983 VW vans, is air-cooled

Yes. Mea culpa.

&gt; and a much sturdier,
&gt; more powerful and longer-lasting engine than the pre-1972 VW engines.

Down, boy! I don't want your honor. ;)

Hooper's Industrial Economy Postulate is thus:

With respect to tools, you pay not for performance but for capacity to
perform. Buy more capacity than you'll utilize, and you'll pay for it in
maintenance costs for the entire life of the tool. Such extra capacity is
utterly wasted.

If I couldn't bear summer without air conditioning, or if I lived three
mountains away from work, or if I handled the van pool for Weight Watchers
it might be different. But I find Type II power to be adequate, components
to be cheap, and the truck is surpassingly easy to work on.

Your mileage may vary, and that's cool. Don't let's quarrel over subjective
evaluations--it's nuts. I didn't insult your van.
