Subject: RE: 81 engine swap ?


&gt;within
&gt;two weeks i will be swapping motors in my 81(california version), due to
&gt;an as-yet unidentified intermittent-but-mostly-present tweedling/chirping
&gt;sound (on revving/acceleration, and sometimes a constant slow chirp at
&gt;idle) and the availability of a low-cost replacement motor.


Isn't anyone going to tease me for not suggesting that Matt put a V6 in it?

My feelings are hurt.  :-(
