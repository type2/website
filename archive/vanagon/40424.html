&gt; One of the guys in the math dept hauled out a can of WD-40
&gt; and we sprayed down all the electrical parts in the engine
&gt; compartment, including the wires, and the _inside_ of the
&gt; distributor cap, let it sit for 5 minutes, and it fired
&gt; right up and ran fairly smoothly! Give it a try next time
&gt; the van decides to get balky.  Good Luck.

Had similar problem on '84 Vanagon GL, even when I just drove
through puddles with no rain around.  Sprayed wires and all
to no avail.  The only mechanic I let work on my VWs finally
found the problem.  Of the wire to the O2 sensor only a few
strands were left and the water on the wire was enough to
give strange readings and cause the misfiring.  Replaced
the sensor.  No more problem.  That's why he is the only
mechanic I go to.
