Subject: Propane Auto-Stop Valve

I replaced the propane auto-stop valve in my '86 Westy 18 months ago, and now
its frozen up again (2nd time in 3 years). The RV shop wants $115 for a rebuilt
valve, and $56 to install it. I read in the archives about rebuild kits- will
one of these fix a frozen valve? Where do I find one? The RV shop said I
probably have moisture in the tank that's causing the valve to rust. How do I
confirm/correct this? Should I just replace the whole tank assembly?

I never had this problem with my '83.
