Subject: Towing a bus

I have towed buses 2 ways.
I have a S-10 Blazer as well as my 70 westy and once I rented a car trailer
from Crofts rental in SAn Jose  (408)377-4802  They have a trailer that you
can winch the bus on and then drive with no problems but you have to have a
tow vehicle rated fot &gt;5,000 lbs. The other way is to use a towing attachmwnt
that fits onto the front cross-tube. This will not let you back up but tows
great. I have not used the dealy where you put the towee cars wheel on a
dolly.

The bracket that fits to the front cross tube is the easiest and most
practical way to do it.

PS I am sorry I forgot I have a towing hitch.
