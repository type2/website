Subject: (fwd) FS: OLD BUS TOYS
From: bustoys_at_laurel_dot_com

Hello All...

Is this the place to post a URL to my collection of old barndoor bus toys that I
am ready to sell?

I have a total of 8 barndoor &quot;Techno&quot; brand 3&quot; buses, and the sought-after 4&quot;
firetruck bus pickup WITH the fire ladder trailer!

If you'd like me to post the URL to pictures, please let me know.  Post to this
newsgroup, but please copy to my e-mail as well.

Thanks.

Jim
