I have a '76 Camper with a poptop and made a move that might piss off some
people on the list...but....I bought a '97 FORD E250 extended body XL
package (carpet, captains chairs and headliner) and converted it to 4WD and
now want to fix up the van like the '76 old girl, with the same type or
better pop top and inside layout. I know about Sportsmobile and I am a good
screw-it-up yourselfer. So far FORD and Quigley(4WD converter in PA) did a
great job. It is my turn. a few questions for the experts.....

1) Is there a new pop top for this van or should I try what Richard did?

2) Any new ideas on other plans for the interior (I have read the VW plans
threads)?

3) Are there any generic or FORD specific 4WD VAN lists?

4) Anyone wanna buy my old camper...she still runs and looks pretty good?
