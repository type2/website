Keep in mind the 6V starter will spin twice as fast when juiced up with 12V. 
Never had a problem with my '66 Deluxe when I converted (until it got 
stolen, but that's probably not the starters fault). If you have the 
original clock in the dash, I hooked up a resistor (sorry, can't remember 
what resistence... get adjustable and mess with it til it keeps time) and 
the thing worked like nice. I think I did an adjustable resistor on the 
wipers... and you could probably get some sort of aftermarket wiper delay 
switch to do it all for you.
