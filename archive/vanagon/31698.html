This should make some of you guys feel a bit better,  stopped
at SAM'S CLUB and lo a late 80's Syncro setting there, looked impeccable
on the outside so I thought I'd leave a note expressing interest for the
parents (always do) look at the dash, 246,873 miles on the clock, geezz.
I decided to wait about for the owner who came out about 15 minutes
later, we chatted briefly, the van was of course not for sale as it was
the guys love, although on its 2nd Wasserboxer (origional had expired at
about 110k, head gaskets) he had never touched a bit of the drivetrain
save for repacking all the cv's and replacing all the boots himself at
about 150k.  It was an '87 he had driven it coast to coast multiple
times, but it was just amazing how clean it looked, frankly looked new,
not a spot of rust or corrosion even down to the alloys.  Just showed
what a good owner can do, he claimed he was keeping it till the viscous
coupling blew sky high (and maybe even past then) or until VW imported a
4wd EV with a price tag under $20k.  I told him to start looking for a
spare drivetrain.
