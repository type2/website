Subject: Need any Kombi parts?

Hi all, 
I picked up a '64 Kombi this past weekend, (I bought it for the rear
bumper,not an easy piece to find around here...)
and will be parting it out asap. It's a Pa rust bucket so forget about
the body!
Here's a run down of what's there, email me if anything intrests ya, 

Complete interior, front bench, folding middle, rear bench.
All exterior lights/ no cracked lenses.
All glass.
Washer bottle with cap.
Am radio/ all switches/gauges/interior lights.
4 decent wheels
Transaxle
Front beam
And all the other little things I can't think of right now.

Thanks already.
