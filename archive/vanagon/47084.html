Subject: Temperature Gauge Going Crazy...

I imagine that most of you have experienced this wild flashing of the 
temp. gauge for no apparent reason...the van is NOT overheating, nothing 
is wrong, it just goes nuts.

My '83 van does it, my friend's '88 does it...the mechanic doesn't know 
what causes it, Volkswagon charged my friend $1,100 to NOT fix it...

It's not the thermostat, the radiator, the hoses, or the instrument 
panel.  

The only 'sure fix' I can think of is black tape across the front of the 
instrument panel so we don't see it!  :)

Any help would be most appreciated.
