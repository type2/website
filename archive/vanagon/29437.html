To do a bird of reasonable size follow the defrost instructions on the bird.

Then immerse the bird (w/o the innards, feet, head and feathers) in a cauldron.
Fill the cauldron with water until quite full.  Remove the bird, refrigerate
if you have a slow stove, and heat the water to boiling.  Immerse the bird
once more, bring back to a boil and shut off the heat.  Cover the pot and let 
stand for ~1-1.5 hours or until the water temp is ~150F.  The bird will be 
almost completely cooked requiring only minimal work in the oven or charcoal
cooker ( I use a Kamado and alderwood).  This avoids the problem of dry 
overcooked outers and raw wiggly inners and keeps the little rascal juicy.

Don't salt the water or you'll toughen the bird.

Do start with a defrosted bird or if you're lucky and you got your order in
early Distel Ranch Sonora Pride does the best hand raised turkeys about and
they're shipped fresh.
