&gt; Bill and Diane Killian don't like somebody's email signature bumper sticker.

Okay I admit I did have the .sig file in the replay but it was not JUST 
the .sig that was political.  It is political opinion that the 'GUMMINT' 
is too big and out to get us.  This is what I was pointing out.  The .sig 
confirms that current neo-conservative anti-government point of view.  I 
would not object to silly comments about pets in a joking manner THAT 
applied to volkswagen transporters.  Remember the cats and ferrets in the 
air duct threads of a few months ago.  That was '/F' level related to VW 
vans.  The 'GUMMINT&quot; out to cheat you and take everything you own is not 
related to VW vans.  But this too is diverging from VW vans so any other 
comments ought to be private as well.

&gt; I think you GOTTA let that stuff go by.  It's not like the opinions are
&gt; catching.  I've always found it interesting:  You read someone's perfectly
&gt; rational posts for months and then suddenly discover that in some non-
&gt; Vanagon part of their lives they have opinions you think are ... wrong.
&gt; Happens with home pages, too -- You're looking at a list of pointers
&gt; someone thinks useful, and among the good ones you find the pointer to
&gt; Bungee Jumping Your Pet.

But is it rational to put a chevy V6 into a VW van?  (Joke honest not 
serious)

&gt; Anyway I'm comfortable ignoring in bumper stickers what neither I nor
&gt; our honored Listmeister seem to tolerate as threads, and I demand that you
&gt; feel exactly the same way I do.  It's the American way.

'demanding' I feel exactly the same as you do is the American way?
