&gt;The bottom line here is that we must unite to fight these lobbying

&gt;arms.  What we do need to do is pick up a pen and paper and write to our
&gt;congressmen, our city council people, our county commissioners.  Let them
&gt;know we understand what is going on and we won't stand for it.  If people
&gt;don't wake up and take immediate action against this lobby, we will indeed
&gt;lose our beloved old VW's--and they will not have been sacrificed for the
&gt;cause of &quot;Clean Air.&quot;

Would you be willing to sacrifice your old VW's for the right of children to
breathe easily?  How about for the right of your children to have a
reasonably cool climate and polar ice caps?

Your father fought to protect people, which is fine and good.  But there are
many people in this world who are only interested in their short-term
pleasure.  This is why we need government regulation.  People (in general)
don't care about long-term dangers.  They don't worry about the collapse of
the ecosystems if it occurs five generations in the future.  And many don't
care at all as long as they're getting personal pleasure in the short term.
