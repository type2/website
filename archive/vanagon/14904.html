 Subject: Re: WANTED: VW BUS

  If you really want a VW camper, I have one.  It's a 1976, dayglo green,
  hideously ugly thing.  It needs some body wrk......engine runs good.....no
  heat....ever try to find a heater relay for one of those things?  Oh
  yeah....some idiot before me grounded the ignition system, so you have to
  roll start it.  I haven't had time to fix that yet.  I have plenty of
  books........if you can read the schematics.  They're fun...I just don't
  have the time for it.
