Subject: Re: Brake Fluid Bleed Questions/cup holders 

I've looked all over the calipers on our '90 Carat and there is only 
one bleed screw per side.  I think the thing is that VW used at least 
three different suppliers of front calipers for the vanagons .  The 
ones on mine don't look like ANY of the ones pictured in Bentley.

The only source of OEM cup holders I've found is the VW dealer($35!!).  
I bought my replacements at Camping World($4).  They're not quite OEM, 
but I don't feel so bad when the kids/dogs snap them off.
