Ta da!

I have a cot that is in good shape that I mistakenly thought was for a pre
'68 bus. I'm sure it is for a 68-74. I'll double check the condition. We can
talk in the neighborhood of $30-40 plus shipping if it is in good shape. The
cot has two stamped aluminum poles (kind of upside down U shape) with a
Khaki colored canvas. A tent is available locally for your year ('68 and
later). It supposedly is in good shape and is complete except for the gusset
peice that goes between the tent and bus for $400-450. plus shipping.  My
advice is to locate a tent with the rails that attach to the rain gutters,
the proper clips to attach the rails to the bus, gusset, tent all of the
poles etc. I bought a tent for my '67 without the rails and clips. It was
nuts trying to find &quot;just&quot; the parts I needed.
