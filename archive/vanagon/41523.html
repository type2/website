Subject: doghouse shroud vent pipe


To all,

Many thanks to all who answered my question about the 1/2 inch pipe
on the top of my doghouse shroud!  Apparently it is part of a
emmision control system on later model VWs and in that application
a pipe would go from this fitting to a charcoal cannister.

Thanks to Thomas Johnson, William R. Kennedy, Scott Allred, Bob Hoover,
Sean Bartnik, Joseph F. Fournier II, Leonard Jones, and Jim Ellis for
emailing me answers!

 Cheers,

  -Dyer
