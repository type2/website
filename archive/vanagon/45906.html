So Craig Standley says:

&gt; 
&gt; Any advice is appreciated.  One thing I have gotten out of this is a ton

Sometimes, it's better to throw in the towel on certain things when
the amount of time invested is returning very little.  I took my '74
in to get the carbs adjusted and $90 later my van was happy, I was 
happy and my wife was happy.  Not a bad investment for $90.  I had
previously spent many hours fiddling with the setup with no change
in performance.

So don't feel bad about chosing this option Craig.....

Cheers!
