&gt;I'm sorry the kid gave up on the engine overhaul but I don't
&gt;think it was my fault.  I think a lot of people nowadays just
&gt;don't have the balls to get back on the horse when it throws
&gt;them.  And that's kind of sad because in a lot of ways, hanging
&gt;in there when the going gets rough really is the mark of a man.

My second Commandment is (loosely stated):

You cannot, never were, and never will be, responsible for the 
behavior/wellbeing of another person.


Bob, your advice is welcomed by me, but I don't hold you responsible for 
anything I do to my car. Or with my life, for that matter. That's my 
responsibility.

BTW, thanks for your advice and inspiration on the list. I've used it 
with great benefit, and I appreciate it without any strings attached.

--Dave

PS--My second commandment doesn't apply to children.
