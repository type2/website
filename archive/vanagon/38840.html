Subject: Re: Help..............won't stop


I'm not versed in brakes on a '72, but I've just been told
that a similar problem on my vanagon is probably due to the
front brakes locking up and heating up. Once they've heated
up, it takes a long time to stop the van. I've been told they
are most likely locking because of a problem with the hoses
that are attached to the calipers and not because of the
calipers themselves. I will be changing the hoses tonight
to confirm this fact.
Hope the input is useful.

&gt; My new lodger has a problem with his 1972 camper. Basically the brakes are awful.
&gt; It stops but not quick enough to feel safe in. He's fitted new drums, shoes, pads,
&gt; master cylinder, slave cylinders, etc...basically the lot, but it still slowly
&gt; grinds to a hault.
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently the brakes on a '72 are unique to that year and it is a '72 specific
&gt; problem with it's own individual cures......_dot_can anyone help????
