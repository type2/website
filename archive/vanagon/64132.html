Subject: fridge repair

I pulled the fridge in my Vanagon once - it took all of about 15 minutes.
non-Westfalia but still they couldn't have made it that hard to get out.
So assuming 1 hour labor for r&amp;r of the fridge another hour (and I'm being
generous) to test for leaks everywhere, what did they do the remaining 6
hours? Bill you for the time it takes to get cold?

Unfortunately mechanic's estimates are at the state level. WA state, for
example, has you sign a statement allowing the mechanic to spend XXX amount
of $, and requiring them to contact you before doing any more.
I don't know what it is in PA.

On a related note, when I first got the Vanagon I took it in to have all
that stuff cleaned up and checked out at a local RV shop (I didn't know
much about working propane then.) They managed to get the old furnace out,
hot-tank the combustion chamber, reassemble it, and check the entire system
for leaks. They charged approx $60. Oh, and they let me watch (and help in
a few instances) so I got to see how to do it myself.

&gt;
&gt;I asked for a dometic estimate and (naturally) could not be told one
&gt;until it was pulled out and looked at.  They test and soaped it up and
&gt;found no leak.  They did lubricate a reset button just outside of the
&gt;fill valvue.  Good work, no problem here.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well a _good_  and _thorough_ cleaning was what it took to fix the
&gt;propane dometic and I picked up the unit today and I was presented with a
&gt;bill for $380!  No parts were included.
&gt;
&gt;This represents 8 hours at $45 per hour.  They never called me with an
&gt;estimate and never in my wildest dreams did I think it would get this
&gt;high without any phone call or any parts.  Seems like he put on the
&gt;blinders, fixed it and billed me without any regard for my wallet. I
&gt;would not have had him go beyond $200 though I did not tell him that.  I
&gt;cannot imagine ever valuing this refrigerator on propane to the tune of
&gt;over $300.  I was told that $380 was typical for this work after it was
&gt;done but never beforehand.
&gt;
&gt;I would like some list opinions on this mechanics bill and lack of any
&gt;estimate (as a matter of fact he never, ever called me in the four days
&gt;he had my daily driver).
&gt;
&gt;What do you think?
&gt;
&gt;Does this seem exhorbitant?
&gt;
&gt;Does it seem like business as usual in the RV repair business not to get
&gt;an estimate?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have any idea how many hours were spent on the leak check? If 1-2
&gt;of the 8 were spent, it would leave 6-7 for the stove?
