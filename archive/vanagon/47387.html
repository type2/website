Subject: Re: upgrading 86-up headlights

In a message dated 96-07-24 10:57:24 EDT, you write:

&gt;&gt;&gt; The low beams on my 87 Westfalia are really terrible
&gt;
&gt;Really?  I had been thinking of replacing the headlights on my '85 
&gt;with the headlights from the '87 parts bus I just bought, because 
&gt;my '85's headlights are so dim.  I had been told that the '86-on 
&gt;headlights are significantly brighter.  Is that correct?

I think we need to stage a &quot;light-off&quot; and determine which has the poorest
headlights. I'd rate my 87's lights as POOR and my 88's (supposedly
identical?) lights as ADEQUATE.  I'd sure like to find an easy upgrade that'd
bring them both to GOOD or GREAT status.
