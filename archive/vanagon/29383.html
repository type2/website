JOhn sez:
&gt;Kim wants to &quot;consult the pros&quot; and trusts us more than Bentley?
&gt;
&gt;Since when did we become PROS, Hell PRO What?
&gt;
&gt;Anyway Happy Thanksgiving to all the PRO VW mechanics out there.
&gt;I know some day I'll figure out how to use that wrench thingy,
&gt;then maybe I'll be a pro.
        I suppose when you take all of our cumulative knowledge, it equals
1 or 2 pros. OTOH, it could also equal several hundred clueless types. So
what's this CV gadget, and how am I supposed to get it on with the steering
wheel in the way?   ;-)

Peace,
