&gt;Joel, you know everything, what do you think?

duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, sure, george, whatever you say. :)
actually, i only THINK i know SOMEthing, and i'm not really sure of that!

but as to the addition of a cat:
it's my belief (only belief, mind you) that the california engines of that
era WERE different (had different timing, and different engine codes ...
so there MIGHT have been some sort of internal cam differences).

i'm of the opinon that it would NOT be a good idea to simply add a converter
to an engine that is not designed for it, BUT! having an engine WITH a cat
would be a good idea. so if you really really wanted to do this, i'd find
someone with a good engine that already had a cat and swap engines. but
even that might prove to be more than you bargained for.

my guess is that some of those sand-rail dune buggy folks would love to
get a non-cat engine (and wouldn't be tooo adverse to swapping a cat engine)
... but you'd run the risk of getting a worn-out engine in the trade. :(
