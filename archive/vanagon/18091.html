&gt;&gt;Tim:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Have you had the repair done by the Antonio Volkswagon? How does it come out?
&gt;&gt;Did they do a good job on the head/gasket repair? I am considering a VW
&gt;&gt;dealer in the bay area for the same repair on the head/gasket too. I am 
&gt;&gt;wondering if The dealer you went to did a good job or not. Did you get the
&gt;&gt;VWoA to pay the bill for you (base on the FTC settlement VWoA agreed upon)?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't remember seeing any follow on posts from you. Please let us know
&gt;&gt;what happened. Thanks.

Well, Apparentlt James Cook is the owner of this 85 Westy who sent the camper
for head/gasket repair. This mail should go to Mr. Cook. Sorry Tim.
