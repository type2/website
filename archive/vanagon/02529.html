Subject: 4x4 Locking Front Diff Query

I did it!

I read Joel's post last week about the front differentail for the syncro with
the factory locker in it and I called up and bought it. It is on its way to
me by truck. 

Here is my question: VW in Germany told me that I cannot install this diff
into my van because the axels or CV Joints don't match. There was something
about the axels being different or of different length or the CVs not mating
to the unit.

Does anybody know the answer to this one?
