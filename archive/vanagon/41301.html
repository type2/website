Subject: Tale of morbidity based on fact

 Recent poem and a few words from the guy From Pittsburg set off
synapsis and neurons and suddenly there are new path-ways to areas
of my brain long dis-used. Or - &quot;I remember this time&quot; - - - - 
 Between Grants Pass, Ore., and the coast there is a very inviting 
road directly to the coast. Looks good on the map. From Gold Beach
to Galice is about 50 miles. The major highways take about 150 miles
to get the same place. About half way is a place called Agness.
 Two winters ago, in the fall still but first snow in the mountains,
a car salesman was transporting a motor home from somewhere down south
to some where else, like Portland. He of course never showed up. They
didn't miss him but they were on the look-out for the motor-home.
 In March, when they were opening the road up between Agness and Silver
Creek, guess who they found? He lasted about a month they think. He sat
there and waited for the snow plows I suppose. Nowhere
does it say that road is closed all winter.
 He didn't even have propane in the shiny new bottles. No food or water. The
van lived with no apparent damage. 
 If you're ever up this way you should try that road, it moseys thru 
the Kalmiopsis Wilderness Area and is really a nice scenic drive.
 The Kalmiopsis has native carnivorous plants, I thought that was kind
of neat. The whole thing is named after some little flower or such and
the zillion acres are set aside so it may live forever. 
 You know those twisty roads that beetles and cafe racers were built for?
That's what it is.
 You might check the weather before you go.
