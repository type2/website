Date: Mon, 18 Apr 94 11:27:48 CDT

Markus,

&gt;just got my 67 camper on the road and it tweeks pretty bad at 55 miles per hour
&gt;... i was wondering if i can stick an overdrive gear or later tranny into the 
&gt;bus so that i can go a little faster on the highway??? has anyone done this???
&gt;since i will drive the bus from ohio all the way to new Foundland and back down
&gt;to south carolina this summer i would really like to be able to go faster!
&gt;any help would be appreciated.
&gt;thanks in advance

I think the Bus Boys sell a late tranny conversion that eliminates the
reduction boxes, which effectively raises you ratios considerably, but you
better have a motor capable of delivering the horses necessary to pull that
much weight! If you're running a stock 1600, I doubt if you'd get more than
20-30000 miles on a *good* rebuild, and less if *I* rebuilt it! :-)

VW engineers may have been a lot of things, but they weren't patently stupid
(most of the time)

Peace,
