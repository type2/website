There is a method to the VW part numbering system. The first 3 digits
indicate the vehicle or engine originally designed for, 251=Vanagon 211=Bus
068=Diesel engine 025=Vanagon engine. The next 3 are group and sub group.
800 is body parts. 100=engine parts 200=exhaust parts 300=transmission
parts 400=front end 500=rear axle 600=brakes 700=cables and shifter 900
electrical. 829 indicates a body part and rear hatch. A 98 sub group, 898
is a body repair kit. The last three with letter and color code if needed
is the part identifier. Generally if the last numeric digit is odd it is a
left side part, even is a right side parts. Parts that don't care what side
they go on are usually odd. For the most part a 251 829 331 B part will
replace a 251 829 331 and a 251 829 331 A. And most times it is backwards
compatible although you don't get any internal improvements if there were
any, and that's usually why the number changes.
