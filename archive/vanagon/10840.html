Subject: Re: What Size Socket?

Ray,

A 3/4 inch wrench will do fine.  I have both metric and English 
equipmetn, and above 19mm, inch and metric are so close as to be no 
matter for any use I've found.  The execption is 130mm, which is 1 3/16 
if I remember right, a weird wrench size in English.

At 19mm &amp; below, sometimes a wrench works and sometimes it doesn't.  1/2 
is close to 13mm, but depending on the application sometimes its OK and 
sometimes not.

&gt; &quot;proper&quot; tool.
