Subject: Dr. Death's Ride (was stigma, was Garcia

Wow ! According to Tom Czerniak, Dr. Jack Kevorkian drives a Baywindow... I 
was 
pleasantly amused by the Deadheads/drugs/sterotypes thread of late but THIS 
news...well... the possibilities are mindblowing !! (no pun intended :)  
What year ?  What color? What size engine? Is 
there an aftermarket CO2 recirculation system installed?  
Really, does anyone know ?
Jody :)
