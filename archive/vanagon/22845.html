From: Owens_at_uh_dot_edu (MICK OWENS)
Subject: Another Be-lated Introduction

I'm Mick Owens from Houston,Texas and work in the Space Vacuum Epitaxy
Center (NASA-sponsored research center) at the University of Houston. I own
two VW's which I bought new: '73 KG Vert (90K miles) and '81 Vanagon Westy
(83K miles). I perform all of the routine maintenance on both, and some not
so routine, e.g., replace push rod tube seals ~every 10K on the Westy,
brake caliper overhaul, gas tank replacement on the Westy. If I can be of
any assistance to anyone on the net, please feel free to contact me -
work:(713)743-3626; FAX (713)747-7724; home (713) 438-8674. I have the
following manuals for both of my VW's: Muir, Haynes, Chilton, and Bentley,
and can look things up for y'all. My most pressing problem right now is
replacement of the entire exhaust system on the Westy, as it seems to be
for many out there. I'm waiting for the state legislature here to decide if
my county (Fort Bend) will be included in new stricter emission testing in
Texas.  It would be really nice if all of you out there could do an
introduction page. Thanks to Lisa for the idea.
Mick
