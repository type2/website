Gerry,

It may be different over there where you are...but in the great
state of Massahtwoshits, collision pays when you are at fault...
and if the other driver is at fault, then his insurance pays
for your damages. Then again, I guess the driver of the tank
didn't have collision...the vanagon owner could always
sue his estate...he did get shot didn't he?
