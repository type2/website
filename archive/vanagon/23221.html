I asked the question on behalf of someone who is not on the list. He lost
his valve seats at 25,000 miles and his friend at 15,000. Both were
rebuilt engines. The question would be: what causes premature breakdown of
the valve seats? It is understandable that valve seats would go on a
engine with a fair number of miles but under 50,000 seems a bit low. Is it
simply luck of the draw? Are those with high mileage type IV engines doing
anything special? It was mentioned earlier that the engine should not be
&quot;lugged&quot; -perhaps that is one answer.....
