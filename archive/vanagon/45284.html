&gt;Parts Place (Recycled Bugs)
&gt;The price was:
&gt;US$49.95 for the luggage rack seal - part# 8-231-831-709
&gt;US$109.95 for the pop top seal - part# 8-231-831-710

YYYYYOOOOOUUUUUCCCCHHHHH!

I must be giving them away - Luggage Seal $25.00  Poptop Seal 69.00.  I've
been making 'em since 1986 and then incorporated them into Bus Boys' line-up
in late '93 when I came to Redding.  I'm sure we sell to them as well as Wolf
West, WCM, RMMW, Delta Six, Whipme, etc.. and hundreds of retail &quot;volks&quot; too.

Should I raise my price? ;)  BTW -  US $440 at the VW Dealer for a Poptop
Seal :(
