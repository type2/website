&gt; Heres my question.  Whats the best way to hook my spare battery into the 
&gt; charging system?  Via isolator or just do like the marine applications 
&gt; do and install a A/B/C switch so only one battery is getting charged at 
&gt; a time? 

Don't use the isolator - too much voltage drop.  Use a high power relay
like they sell at camping world.  It's a small silver canister, about
$12.

&gt; Also, how about running multiple batteries in parallel.  Can the 
&gt; alternator handle recharging upwards of 3 batteries after a rather 
&gt; lengthy drain down period?  

1.  Try to avoid it
2.  If you drive long enough.  I have 3 batteries and my alternator
	is still going strong.  Try not to drain your batteries more than
	50%.

These questions have been answered in detail before.  I am too tired to
rewrite a long answer at the moment, but plenty of info should be
available by searching the list archive.  Someday I'm going to write up
a FAQ on this stuff (or has someone already done it?)
