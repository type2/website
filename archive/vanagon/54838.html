Subject: Pad over engine &amp; Fire extinguisher


I was looking for new pad that covers the engine and completes the lower 
bed in my Camper.  Any suggestions?

Also, I wanted to find a fire extinguisher that would fit in the holder 
next to the sliding door.  Mine wasn't there when I bought the van.
I would appriciate any help.

thanks,

kyle
