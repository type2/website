Subject: Re: VW part number interpretation, or more engine ID

 the part number you listed, 113 101 375 A, with either
61 or 71 on the next line (61 on the right head, 71 on the left).
is not listed in my 1972 type 1 parts list, so it was not available from the
dealer at that time.   Hm..  Probably some kind of 1600 dual port,  but take
it to a shop to make sure ( is there one in your town?)   You would know if
you had a 36hp or a 40 horse by the case number. 

   I personally like the stock bus mufflers the best for my bus.  Headers
tend to leak, as well as be noisier, but whatever floats your boat....
