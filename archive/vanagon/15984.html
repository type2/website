&gt; By the way folks, after a great deal of research I determined that the Exide
&gt; combination trolling/starting deep cycle marine battery size group 27 will
&gt; just barely fit in the place under the drivers seat as an auxiliary battery.
&gt; It has 160 mins reserve capacity and something like 700 marine caranking
&gt; amps. The &quot;Gold&quot; version of this group 27 size battery will not fit. Also,
&gt; group 27 sizes from other manufacturers usually won't fit although some might.

Just thought I would add that I looked for quite a while to find the
deep-cycle group 27 battery with the highest rated reserve capacity.  It
turned out to be the Die Hard Gold, which is rated 210 minutes reserve
capacity.  I also bought a Motocraft deep cycle, rated at 150 mins.  That
one I bought cause it was cheap, at $49.  Both of them together have
served me fairly well, compared to other deep cycles I have owned.  They
are getting near two years old now, and starting to weaken (they ran down
a little faster at Red Rock than they used to).
