&gt; &gt;And I guess that back to the military spending question, why did this 
&gt; &gt;congress try to give the military more money than they had even asked for 
&gt; &gt;while advocating cutting social programs?
&gt; =========================
&gt; 1)  It is called Civilian control of the military
Huh?  Non-sequitor.
&gt; 2)  It has to do with politics and pork barrel legislation
This is exactly correct.
&gt; 3)  Please note that the Congress and Executive branch now have a majority of
&gt; members (and in particular, a &quot;Commander-In-Chief) that have NO experience in
&gt; the military, yet are responsible for setting the responsibilities of the
&gt; military and committing them to action.  Yet they have NO personal experience
&gt; of what this involves.  They have yet to specify exactly what in Bosnia is in
&gt; the vital interest of the United States that is worth the committment of US
&gt; forces, what the rules of engagement will be so our people can protect
&gt; themselves, and to what extent (how many casualties) are they willing to keep
&gt; our forces committed.
This is irrelevant to the congress bugetting more than the pentagon 
through Clinton asked for.

But I'm quite sure no Eurovans or old Vanagons were requested in either 
budget B^)&gt;
