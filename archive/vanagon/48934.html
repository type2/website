Subject: Ford V6 inside Vanagons Rep.


For the 'powerhungry':

I got to know of Dirk on the 'VW Bus Page Germany'
and I asked him about his experiences and a short
description of his engine conversion to a Ford V6
with 114 PS. I do not know his kind of former
engine or gearbox.


Dirk Mikosch wrote, and I try to translate:

I converted the engine by myself on an own design.
The flywheel was maschined by DS-Tuning (flywheel
and gearbox adaptor 650.00 DM). TUV approval costs
app. 400.00 DM. A new engine support (200.00 DM)
and other smaller parts (400.00 DM) and engine.
Because of the conversion the decklid raised by
4 in. I worked one week on this conversion and
welded engine support, exhaust system and fitted
coolant pipes.

The Vanagon is used as a Camper and  I have only
experiences on long distance drivings. After
conversion I drove 8,000 miles and the Vanagon covers
15-17 miles/gal by towing a 5,500 lb trailer on
55 mph, and 20 miles/gal by running 75 mph without
towing load. The weight is 400 lb more than before
conversion and in total 9,000 lb. The regular cooling
system is supported by an oil heat radiator and also
in high mountain the oil temp do not raise across
220 F with and without towing load.
