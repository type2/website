&gt; I have a CA State Park map right in front of me and it doesn't specify

&gt; However, the phone number for Pfeifer BS State Park is (408)667-2315 
&gt; and I'm sure they can tell you whether or not you can be clean or go 
&gt; stinky. ;)  To reserve sites you need to call the Mistix number for 
&gt; reservations: 1(800)444-7275.  
&gt; 
&gt; The Park is 26 miles south of Carmel on Hwy 1.  821 acres. 215' 
&gt; elevation.  Motel-type cabins for rent.  217 developed sites; 
&gt; trailers 24', campers 27'.

I camp in the Big Sur area often ... maybe once or twice per month. 

This is just one of about three or four very nice places there. There is 
also Ventana private campgrounds with showers, and some others I forget 
their names. If there is a room or shower problem, there are certainly 
several alternatives.

Group dining for 15 or 20 or whatever could be arranged at the River Inn  
or even up at one or two other restaurants with seaside views from the 
mountain/shore.

There are two or three decent small grocery stores there .... everything 
within 10 minutes.

On most Saturday nights, they've got some good live music at the River 
Inn, and twice per month a dance show that is great by the Big Sur 
Natives.... african/native/drums/island type 'o thing.
