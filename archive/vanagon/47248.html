&gt; On July 16 Bruce Norton asks:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I had an 82 Country Homes camper for a few years.  The van was possessed
&gt; (as in needing an exorcism) but the camping stuff worked out OK.  I never
&gt; had a Westy but think the Westy stuff is a little better made.  One
&gt; advantage that County homes advertised was that all the camp gear was
&gt; removable.
Yea, I contacted Country Homes, now located in San Jose, CA, they confirmed
that the camping stuff is removable, although they couldn't seem to tell
me what made it better or different from the westy, other than it cost
$1000 more.
  
&gt; The only funky thing I didn't like about the camp set up was the bed which
&gt; was thin plywood with a foam pad over it.  it was comfortable enough but
&gt; still cheesy. Can't help on worth of an 84.

I assume you are refering to the bed in the poptop, not the rear bed?
The one I looked at had a vinyl covered wood, i guess, section that
was part of the bed, or could be moved to provide additional headroom
in the kitchen area.

Thanks for the comments, I think I'm going to have someone check out
the mechanical condition of it and make an offer. With any luck I'll
officially join the ranks of the vw crowd, have to look for the next
west coast campout!
