Hello all


I was just wondering, doea anyone out there worry about the fact that there is 
not a lot of stuff between the driver and the outside world in a bus??


I have not, until I recently got hit from behind..  I think that one can see and 
avoid any oncomming traffic, so, is this a factor??  I am still gonna buy 
another Vanagon!!!  Is it proper to calll a Vanagon a bus?? Or is this reserved 
fotr the older VW??
