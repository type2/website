&gt; Problem: the Duckmobile is at 92.5 k, the exhaust system needs replacing,
and 
&gt; it has developed the &quot;head leak.&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  Symptoms: oil on left two spark plugs (right ones always black)
&gt;  	-decreased gas mileage
&gt;  	-engine uses about 1 qt oil every 500 mi
&gt;  	-oil on the underside of the engine block, where the two halves meet
&gt;  	-THICK blue smoke (like in the cartoons, when the bad guy gets away)

While you may have &quot;A head leak&quot;, the symptoms you describe are not
consistant with &quot;THE head leak&quot;  &quot;THE&quot; head leak is when COOLANT leaks out
past the head/case coolant gasket and onto the ground.  There is no oil
invloved with &quot;THE&quot; head gasket leak.

Good luck,
