Yep, the new muffler and recharged AC make my 84 Vanagon much nicer to drive 
now.
 But the sr. mechanic who road tested my van before they told me it was done 
wrote &quot;needs trans work, carrier bearings bad. $750-$1,000&quot;.  My van makes a 
grinding noise when I let up on the gas pedal.

Can anyone provide some insight on this?  How serious could this be?  How 
likely is it that a non-gear head could fix it?  How do I explain to my wife 
that we may have to spend more on the Vanagon? etc.
