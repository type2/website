Subject: Very Cool Shirt!

	I too got my tee shirt in the mail and its very, very, cool!
Glad to see that the bay-window / bubble-bus depected had the
early style low-mounted turn signals- like all three in my life so far :)

	Didn't get a chance to look at the parts book last night about
disk-brake conversions, maybe tonight.

	Cheers!
	Bill
