Subject: Re: Vanagon shocks...keep it coming!

I've been installing KYB shocks on all VW's that come thru our shop 
for the last5 years.  We've had nothing but great results from these 
shocks.  On 68-79 type 2 we use the white gas shocks in the rear and the 
slightly softer silver ones inthe front.  Due to the fact that the 
weight is mostly in the rear, putting a softer shock in the front makes 
the ride very pleasant.

  Kyb has a lifetime guarantee and 8 years ago I installed a set on my 2 
wd toyota p\u and they are as good today as the day I installed them.

  The Monroe and other companys shocks don't seem to hold up as well to 
the use (abuse) that the VW owners due to there cars.  I do live in an 
area were there is saltair and mountains to deal with so there is just 
reason for some of the things I see on a daily basis.

  Just my 2 cents on the shock issue.
