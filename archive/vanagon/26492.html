Euro-American/Delta 7 (N Hollywood) shows a &quot;Water Spout, DS3400 Chrome 
single faucet&quot; for the &quot;Water System (early models)&quot;  for $18.90 on my 
wholesale price list.  Call 818/760-4214 to order, and if the retail price 
is excessive, e-mail me and I'll order and drop-ship it to you, or 
something.....

  The faucet on my '73 Westfalia started leaking at the
base of the spout.  It has been weakened over the years
by slamming the sink cover down on it.  The spout has
recently fallen out of the pump housing.
  Does anyone have any advice on repairing/replacing this
busted faucet?
 
TIA,
