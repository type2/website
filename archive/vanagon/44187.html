Rodney asks if anyone can punch holes in his theory of depreciating
restoration costs as a way of rationalizing absurd expenditures.

As one who has given up hope of containing the costs to a double on my $3900
original purchase, I submit the true test is asking if you would do it again
knowing what you know at the end. The answer for all except the true nut
ought to be &quot;No, I'd rather pick off the other poor schmuck who doubled his
cost and is now selling for half.&quot;

Rodney is correct that once you're at the back end of your project you have
no other way to justify your poor decision except a multiyear depreciation
schedule.

BTW, I saw a 74 Thing in the paper tonight in need of &quot;minor repair&quot; for only
$1,200...Hmmmmmmmm
