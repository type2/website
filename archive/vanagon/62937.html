Subject: '85 Westy cutting out in high temp

Hi All,

My '85 Westy has been running good, but lately with the 100 + degree
temperatures here (in New Mexico) it has been cutting out.  I'll be
driving along under miscellaneous conditions, say, 70 mph on the freeway
or 30 in city, with or without the A/C, and it just dies.  Usually it
starts right back up within one to three seconds, but once it didn't and I
had to pull over.  After waiting a couple minutes it started back up as if
nothing had happened.  Any ideas?  It only seems to happen when the
temperatures get into the mid 90's.  Also, there are no other symptoms
like over heating indicated on the temp gauge.

Thanks, as usual, to the  best list serve I've been on...

Ivan
