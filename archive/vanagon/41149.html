Subject: Re:  New vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu Bumper Stickers

To All,

I just finished making some cool bumper stickers for list members.  I 
bought Richard Palmer's window stickers, and I think they're cool, but 
here's something a little different:

They're black on white with good line drawings of a Splittie, then the 
VW-in-a-circle symbol and a Late Bus ('72-'79) to the right.  Under this 
it says _vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu_ in large type that's legible from a 
little distance.  If I can find good line drawings of a Vanagon and EV, 
I can scan them at hi-res and make similar bumper stickers for 
Vanagon/EV owners.  Maybe a Splittie and a Vanagon for one, and a 
Splittie and an EV for another.

These are printed on adhesive-backed sticker material at 1200 x 1200 dpi 
and sprayed with fixative to make them weather-resistant.

To get these, send $5 for three stickers, or $10 for seven stickers, to:

Vanagon Stickers
c/o Paramount Publishing / RDR
Box 3730
Amarillo TX  79116-3730

I'll send them by return mail within a couple of days or so.
