&lt;&lt;    1. Was there ever any factory or dealer option to put an additional 
      single seat in the Westfalia in proximity to the sliding door?  I can 
      see how it might be done with an extra front seet, swivel plate, and a 
      purpose-made pedestal.
       &gt;&gt;

I met a guy at the Carlisle import show, weekend before last, who had a '85
westy GL, with the cargo floor tracks.

He said he had a optional middle seat that slid in on the tracks in the
floor.
I'm thinking &quot;two person middle seat out of a 7 pass&quot; 'cause that fill fit.
but that's not the one he had.
He had a SINGLE captains chair (front seat) mounted on 2 small runners that
slid into the tracks in the floor. 

Anyone heard of this before??  
he said it was original. I've heard of a single captains seat on a swivel
base BOLTED to the floor directly behind the front pass, but never a single
that slid into the tracks.

odd.
