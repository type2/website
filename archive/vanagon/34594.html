Subject: RE: placement of stickers


&gt;Ugh - what about people with tinted glass?  Also, going fast
&gt;on the freeway, you'd only finally realize this was a fellow
&gt;listmember by th time you saw it in the rear view mirror, and THEN
&gt;it would be too late to wave!  :(


Sticker goes on the outside of the window, remember?

Maybe two stickers should be standard (thus increasing sticker sales  :)
one on the botton left of the rear, one on the windshield directly in
front of the rear view mirror? Then you can peg fellow listmembers
coming OR going!
