Subject: Re: Vanagon airconditioning hoses

&gt;Just a tip (OK a story) to share about vanagon A/C hoses.
&gt;
&gt;A few years ago I had problems keeping A/C refrigerant in my 84 Vanagon.
&gt;Checked all the connections over and over, and found no problem.  Borrowed
&gt;an electronic leak detector, and found nothing around the connections.
&gt;Laying under the van, I started to study the long rubber hoses that stretch
&gt;from engine to condensor (way up front).  Hoses were kind of oily (slick).
&gt;Lo and behold, the electronic leak detector beeps along the entire length
&gt;of the hoses!  Apparently the hoses had deteriorated with age, and R12 was
&gt;just oozing through the hoses, taking trace amounts of oil with it.
&gt;
&gt;Dealer wanted space shuttle prices for hoses (they're really long).  None
&gt;of the FLAPS could order them either - the compressor connections used on
&gt;the vanagon are rare.  My solution:  Found a place that carries A/C hose in
&gt;bulk (made by Goodyear).  I bought about 30 feet, and got some special
&gt;clamps.  The clamps look like regular hose clamps, but they're a bit
&gt;sturdier and have a small metal hook tack-welded to the band.  The hook is
&gt;used to make sure the clamps are installed at exactly the right position on
&gt;the hose end.  I went home and cut off the OEM crimp clamps (they cut off
&gt;very easily with a hacksaw, but be careful not to damage the metal
&gt;connector pipe underneath the hose.)
&gt;
&gt;The Goodyear hose has thicker walls than OEM hoses, but the inside
&gt;diameters are a teeny bit smaller.  I had to work hard pushing the old
&gt;metal connectors into the new hose.  But once I finished, I was really
&gt;pleased.  Kept A/C in the car for about two years...
&gt;
&gt;I've lost the charge again, but this is due to the compressor connectors
&gt;coming loose.  I haven't figured out a way to keep those connections tight.
&gt;Over time, engine vibration and motion seems to loose the connections.
&gt;Then the O-rings get beat up, and the gas escapes.  With today's R12
&gt;prices, I'll probably just go without.  So I've got nice hoses with no
&gt;freon ... sigh.

John,

This is a great idea, and I'm about to take a similar approach in fixing
three hoses on my van.  VW dealer wants about $300 to $500 each for these
hoses.  I talked with a couple of local A/C shops who said I should bring
in the old hose and they will make a copy.  They will also try to reuse the
old fittings.

Where did you find the Goodyear hose, was it available in different metric
sizes?  I guess its very important to use the correct size diameter hose so
that the fittings don't loosen up as you described.
