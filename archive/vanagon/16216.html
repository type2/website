Subject: my access provider messed up

Hi Folks,

My access provider has screwed things up.  I cannot even send mail out
to unsubscribe (from my domain) so you will not get the nasty bounced
messages ( I suspect this has not started yet ).

Gerry, would you please change my address to:

cetin_at_seas.bellcore_dot_com

for the time being?  At least, this way I'll keep in touch until they
fix the things.  

Thanks...
Cetin Seren
