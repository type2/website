I know of at least one other person with this problem so I thought I 
would post about it.  On my '71 bus the drivers side door would not 
lock or unlock from the outside.  I got out the Bentley's and pulled 
the handle mechanism out.  Not that difficult if you have the manual 
but watch those sharp edges on the sheet metal.  It got me a good one.
I was thinking I might just need to lube up the mechanism but I found 
instead one broken spring.  I pulled the two pieces of the spring out 
of there and put the whole thing back together.  I didn't have another
spring nor did I have the time to go find one.  Now, the lock will 
unlock and lock from the outside as long as I give the key a few turns
in the direction it needs.  Better than it was before.  I will replace
the spring someday but it works for now.
