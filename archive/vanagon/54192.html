 F.Y.I.-FS Early Vanagon (aircooled) N Ca.

Saw this one (two town brown) at a used car lot (Automatic Caution Warning
here!) in San Jose Ca. at the corner of Race Street and San Carlos.

It has been there a while because I don't go past that intersection very
often at all, and I saw it yesterday and remembered it from the last time I
went by, at least weeks ago.

Don't know anything about it other than it appears physically intact from
the outside, color, and the fact that it is an air cooled engine.

Standard disclaimer:  I have no connection with the seller, etc etc etc.
Harvey
