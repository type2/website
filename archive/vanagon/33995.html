Subject: Parting out '72 Westy
Date: Mon, 29 Jan 1996 10:04:46 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	Due to the stupid California DMV and some other unforseen problems,
Jeff Schneiter and I have decided that it would be best for him to find
another bus, and since it will cost a lot of money to register the bus I
think I am going to part it out.  The Westy interior is in good shape.
Other parts up for grabs are the rear bumper, front end, side louver
windows and other glass, and steering column.  If you need something
drop me an e-mail.  I suppose the 1.8 engine is for sale too although I
may keep it for a spare.

-David
