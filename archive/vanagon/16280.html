Subject: Re: Replacing Propane Regulator

Keep in mind: 

1. It is really easy
2. The metal is really, really soft, so don't overtighten or it will break
suddenly
3. Be sure to test your connections with soapy water
4. You can still get the 290s from Delta Six, it turns out, if you don't
want to trim the plastic box
5. Some of the connections on the regulator are backwards threads so turn
these the *other* way to loosen
6. No special tools are needed but you need various wrenches 
7. While you are under there, note how the skid plate is attached. If you
were to bash this skid plate hard enough on a rock or a curb it could break
loose and tear the hardware off your propane tank and the propane would come
out and make your van look like some Federal office buildings I've been
hearing about. Think about starting a project later to reinforce this skid
plate by bolting some L brackets onto it that go up to the floor of the van.
8. Any authority will always tell you *not* to work on any part of the
propane system yourself  but to take the job to a qualified specialist. I
heard the advice and it bears pondering but I never saw anything about
working on the system that was that hard. Just test your connections with
soapy water. 
9. If you want to get ambitious, add a Gasglow propane pressure gage
(Camping World) at the same time you are chanigng the regulator. This
requires drilling a new hole in the skid plate for the gasses to escape
downward out of the plastic box and is a somewhat aggrivating job.
10. I expect to be changing my *own* regulator within the next three weeks
cause it went bad and I have a spare 290.
11. The worst part about changnig the regulator is when you see how much
rust there is down there and you have to remove everything, including the
tank, wire brush, sand, remove flaking rustproofing, paint, rustproof and
reinstall.

Driveway Time Estimates:

1:30 remove skid plate and regulator, replace regulator, 
        reinstall skid plate
2:00 add Gasglow gague (drill new holes in skid plate)
5:00 remove all rust from skidplate, regulator, vehicle underside, 
          paint, rustproof, reinstall (thorough version)
1:30 (quick and dirty version of above)
0:30 The time it takes for your van to turn into a junk heap if the 
         tank rusts a hole and the propane explodes or if you smash
         the skid plate off and it knocks off the regulator and things ignite

&gt;I need to replace the propane regulator on my '87 Westy.
&gt;
&gt;I already know the deal about getting the Marshall 290 (cuz they don't make
&gt;the 260 no more) and trimming the plastic shield.
&gt;
&gt;What I don't know is whether or not I should undertake this job myself.
&gt;Looking at it, it appears to be a simple task, but I don't want to screw up
&gt;and wind up with a propane gusher - either during the install or after.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone done this themselves? If so, what's the blow by blow, and what -
&gt;if any - special tools or precautions are required?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
