Subject: Re: sliding door vent window
Date: Sat, 10 Feb 1996 12:26:45 GMT

&gt;OK, this is a '78 bus and the lower pivot for the sliding door vent
&gt;window has rotted away and is now nonexistent.  This means that I must
&gt;replace something.  Bentley says how to get it out and in so that's 
&gt;not the problem.  I'm wondering if I have to buy a whole new frame
&gt;or if the frame is in pieces and I could buy the bottom piece
&gt;separately?

If it's a rectangular one, like in my '71, the frame is (was)
effectively one piece (there's a C shape around the front of the
window made of channel section riveted to the profiled upright that
the main window seals against).I ended up fabricating a new frame, as
there was only the window rubber holding the rust together. I didn't
even bother checking if the frame was available, because I didn't have
any money to spend if it was. The fabrication job wasn't quite right -
the window is slightly twisted in its frame which means you need to
have the door open and use both hands to close it! At least it blocked
the hole. Bottom pivot now rides in a nylon 'P' clip intended for
holding wires etc. (Still adjustable for tension).

&gt;
&gt;if I can find one in good shape.  Also, has anyone else had to
&gt;remove that window?  Is it as easy as it looks? (I know, it's
&gt;never as easy as it looks, but just checking.) 

Again, assuming this is the same as my '71, you need to take the main
window out to remove the vent window frame - it has its own rubber &amp;
is straightforward to remove/re-fit. The separate vent window frame
then pulls back slightly and can be released from the main window
frame through two special cut-outs. The complicated rubber that goes
all round the frame can't be removed until the frame is out of the
main window.

&gt;Hints, suggestions, ideas???

I had to do something because I had sheared the bottom pivot pin off
the glass carrier trying to force the window open.

hint #1 don't force these vents.

hint #2 If you're very quick, and very lucky, you can weld (mig) the
pivot pin back onto the glass carrier with the glass in place
(couldn't get it out - last resort!)

hint #3 Try your hardest to get hold of a decent frame before you
touch anything - if yours disintegrates as you remove it, the main
window can't be re-fitted properly.

hint #4 Don't expect to be able to undo screws which have been sitting
inside damp rubber for 20 years

hint #5 The flange where the main window sits may need cleaning up /
minor repair.

And finally, hint #6 If you do find a decent frame, clean it up and
give it a good coat of paint before you fit it.
