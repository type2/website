Subject: Re: CV Joints

  I have put several CV joint on to axles with out a press. After
  breaking several tool on the last axil/CV joint I said Naver again,
  It just isn't worth the money to replace the tools.

&gt; A  little local shopping has yielded the following prices on CV

&gt; VW Dealer - Axle complete, new parts, $747 each side (yikes)
&gt; (and they wonder why we don't go there!)
&gt; Brands refer to CV's not axles.
&gt; 
&gt; New Moog $99.99 ea per side whole axle exchange
&gt; New MPR $99.75 ea per side whole axle exchange
&gt; 
&gt; New Lobro $69.95 ea CV plus $15 boot kit
&gt; 
&gt; One FLAPS says that CV mfg sells axles cheap to keep 
&gt; people from taking apart CV joints.
&gt; So the question is, anyone have experience with these brands?
&gt; I can put CV's on my own axles but at twice the price of a 
&gt; whole, already assembled axle, WHY SHOULD I? (other than the Muir 
&gt; philosophy of getting close to one's transportation . . . )
