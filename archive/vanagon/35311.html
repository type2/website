Subject: New brass raceway for horn

Hello,

You guys know the brass raceway that is on the back of the
steering wheel that completes the circuit for the horn.  Mine
had become defective (bent), can you get replacements for 
these?  After ripping  mine out, it looks like they are
easy to slide new ones in.

On a lighter note, someone may have tried to steal my van 
tonight. We can only hope that the thief had a passion for
Vanagons like we do, other wise he may of not taken care of
it or ended up driving it off a cliff in frustration.

Which reminds me of a story, two weeks ago I went to the 
store parked on the edge of steep cliff which lead down
to another parking lot below,  I went into the store to
pick up some stools.  I was putting one in the back hatch
when the Van started to roll, I had forgotten to put the
van in gear.  The first thing that goes through my mind is
should I let it go or give it a bigger push?  I have been
having problems with the Van lately.  Anyhow, I started 
thinking about how I would feel about it crashing and 
burning,  It was not a good thought, anyhow it might land 
on someone or hit someone.  So I grabbed the trailer hitch
and waited for someone to come by and help me.  How
embarrassing, boy Vanagons sure do build character or
maybe just humility.
