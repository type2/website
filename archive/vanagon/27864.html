&gt; Reminds me of some of my mispent youth reading my dad's old Mechanix
&gt; Illustrated magazines.  I remember articles about people installing surplus
&gt; WWII airplane engines in various vehicles.  I think these were immense
&gt; Allison engines, but I could be mistaken.  Its been over twenty five years
&gt; since we threw these out. :(

Don't they use those engines in those tractor pullin type vehicles?  Three
or four of them even?  One for each wheel?  Wonder if you could fit
four of them in a breadloaf?
