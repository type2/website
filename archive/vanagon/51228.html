Subject: Johnny Lightning Split Busses found!!!

All,

Well the Johnny Lightning Split Busses are here....in a nice two tone Red &amp;
Black.  There is supposed to be a Blue one comin out too, haven'y found it
yet.  According to the packaging there is only 4800 of these to be had.  A
small run considering Hot Wheels Limited Editions are run in quantities of
7,000 - 10,000.

There were only 10 at my local store..($14.99 each!) if anyone is interested
in one please E-mail me direct.
