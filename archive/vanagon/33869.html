Subject: Case Mating Rite...

In 1980 I was living in Palo Alto at the corner of Palo Alto Avenue and 
Homer, for those of you in the know.  Four bedrooms, two baths and a full 
basement, all for $450 a month.  I think the house goes for $2000 now.  

I had the pleasure of having my 66 camper with the 1300 in it suck a valve
for the third time in the seven years I'd owned it.  The fellow I bought
it from redlined it at every shift, up and down, and I got in the habit. 
It sure sounded nice with the extractor muffler.  Plus, I was driving a
six speed diesel school bus (Yes, Mr. Kautz, bus #21) and that's how you
drove diesels.  Double clutching up and down, scaring old ladies, making
teenagers turn their heads and dogs cringe.  But smooth, oh so smooth...

At any rate, I was a pro at dropping, rebuilding, and reinstalling my
engine.  The Idiot Book was suitably and properly soiled with grease,
coffee and beer.  This time I dropped that puppy by myself, using my Sears
2 ton hydraulic $40 jack, got it up a curb and to the basement door.  I
stripped off the tin and waited for my roommate to get home from building
kitchen cabinets in a five million dollar home in Woodside to help me
&quot;manhandle&quot; the thing down the stairs onto the work bench. 

I dismantled the engine, all business, knowing what the #3 piston would
look like, and it did.  It had a nice hole in it.  I kept the piston with
my Baccarat bunny and family pictures on the knick-knack shelf for years. 
I don't remember what happened to it.  Too many moves. 

I took a couple weeks finding cheap heads, finally buying two from a 
fellow who did machining in his garage.  I got the crank polished, a 
new camshaft, rods, pistons and cylinders, the works.  All for $300 
or so.  I cleaned all the parts, and painted the tin a nice deep red.  

My girlfriend at the time was my boss, 14 years older than me.  You know
what they say.  Halve your age and add seven years.  That's the youngest
person you should go out with.  She was 42 so it worked out.  At any rate,
as part of her broadening her horizons she was taking an active part in
helping me with my engine, getting greasy and cleaning and learning what
parts were what, what they did, and why.  After being in a deadening
marriage for 19 years hanging with a &quot;younger man&quot; was pretty fun for her. 
But what really got her going was splitting the case and then, when ready,
&quot;mating the case halves&quot;.  She kept asking when we were going to &quot;mate the
case&quot;.  Invariably saying this phrase brought on cascading laughter and
lascivious looks.  She was pretty rollicky to be with. 

I'd put the rods on the crank and the bearings in the case.  Everything
was ready to go.  I'd been playing this up as a very crucial and serious
thing, this putting the case halves together.  She'd ask, &quot;when are we
mating the case&quot; and break out laughing and I'd stand there, a slight
frown on my face, waiting for her laughter to subside, and admonish her
that mating the case was a very critical step in rebuilding the engine. 
It wasn't something to joke about.  I'd start to tell her for the tenth
time about the first time I rebuilt an engine and how we put in the wrong
size rod bearings and how I didn't want anything like that to happen again
and she'd roll her eyes and groan. 

At any rate, we agreed to mate the case after work one day.  She was all 
excited and acting mysterious.  I'd been playing the serious role so long 
I had no idea what was going on in reality.  Couples get like that over 
routine things when they're working well together.  The fantasy gets 
woven into the fabric of mundanity and play and work and love all jumble 
together.  Too bad it's not a permanent core of the human condition.  

I had the yellow glue (I can't remember the name) all ready to go, the 
right size sockets and torque wrench and everything I needed.  We were in 
high spirits, although I was nervous too.  I really didn't want to have 
to do it again.  We laughed our way down the stairs into the basement.  I 
turned on the lights and she told me to turn them off.  &quot;What&quot; I said.  
&quot;Just turn them off she said&quot;.  I did as I was told.  

She had apparently stashed a paper bag behind the wood lathe and brought 
it out.  She put it on the work bench next to the two halves.  Out of it 
she pulled four candles and holders.  She lit the candles and placed two 
on either side of the case halves, and two behind the halves, 
backlighting them.  I must admit, what with the pegboard filled with 
woodworking tools above the bench, the clean newspaper under the case 
halves, the halves themselves lightly resting on their head bolts, making 
a V, that it was a awe inspiring scene.  

She took me by the hand and we stood for half a minute or so drinking in the 
display.  She leaned over and stood on tiptoe and kissed me on the cheek 
and said, &quot;Come over here&quot;.  I started to ask what was going on, and she 
shushed me.  

She backed me up against the workbench and case halves, and we made love.

Afterwards, lights on, coveralls back up, with loving care we mated the
engine halves.  Two days later the engine went back in the bus.  You know,
I don't remember how starting it went.  I must have gone ok because I
drove it for another three years before it sucked another valve and I sold
it for $75. 

My friend and I went our separate ways a year later.  I've often wondered 
what she's doing, and if she ever got a bus...
