Subject: Re: corrections on capacitor fix air flow box (22MFD vs 10MFD?)

Scott:

The polarity should not matter with a tantalum capacitor. By definition
they are un-polarized. Only with regular electrolytic capacitors do you
have to watch
 the + and -.
The higher the voltage rating, above the voltage that you are applying to
it,  the better. 
 As far as 22 vs 10 that depends on what your are trying to filter .

Good Luck
