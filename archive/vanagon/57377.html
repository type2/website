I am no longer a 'Lurking Sniveling Unknown' or a Wannabus!!  I just 
purchased an 86 Westy GL w/ auto trans and I live in KY.  That would make 
our grand total '2'!!  After looking around for about a year and getting 
serious about it in the last couple of months, I feel that I got lucky.  
Of course I have only had a chance to drive it a few miles and spend 
about 1/2 hr total w/it (not yet named).  After picking it up from 
seller, I took it immediately to the doctor to have a post physical (I 
had that done before the purchase) treatments (full tune up, 60K service) 
 I am looking forward to spending my vacation week with it though (I have 
vacation from one of my jobs next week).
'Thank you' to all
Many of you have generously offered your comments and suggestions.  Your 
collective experience is invaluable.  Thanks!
Gretchen and Lee
