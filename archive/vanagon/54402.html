Subject: Color Codes for 86 Westy Syncro. HELP!

I'm still in need of some help in finding the proper paint codes for my van.
Is there a sticker or plate somewhere on the van? I tried to search the
archives , but came up empty handed , my body man is attempting to assure me
that if I only bring in the van he can make a pretty good match !{I'd love
to trust him though it's my brother in-laws dealership and this could make
for some rather ugly family get togethers}

Kris Weber      HELP!!!
