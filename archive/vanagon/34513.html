Subject: Re: need exhaust system for 87 syncro

&gt;The exhaust system on my 87 syncro has just about rotted out.  I've taken it
&gt;to a local muffler shop and the guy refuses to put a blow torch to it.  The
&gt;dealer advises that it wil cost many $$$$$$$ to replace the exhaust pipes.
 I
&gt;am unaware of any after-market manufacturers who make exhaust parts for
&gt;syncros.  All the local salvage yards are devoid of a single syncro.  
&gt;
&gt;Any Ideas Here????  I am completely frustrated at the prosptect of paying
big
&gt;bucks for exhaust piping but as things stand I don't seem to have much
&gt;choice.   

there are only two major exhaust pipes that are unique to the Synchro.  The
fron engine pipe and the pipe leading into the CAT.  Although the tailpipe is
different, a standard pipe will work fine.  All the non-synchro pieces are
available aftermarket at about 40% off dealer price.  Beware the quality and
fitt are inferior but they will work. Same with the muffler.  I can get you
these pieces if needed.  I would try to negotiate with the dealer to give you
wholesale prices ~20% on large purchase.  If you plan to keep vehicle for a
while, this is best way to go.  
Dennis.
