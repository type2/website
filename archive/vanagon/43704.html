Subject: Guages/Parts...etc...

Greetings all....

I have a question about guages....I would like to install the following on my 
'81 Westy.._dot_can you pass along advice as to price, whereabouts, accuracy, etc?

1)  Independent head temp. (Right/Left)
2)  Oil pressure
3)  Oil temp

Secondly:  Michele's dad just kicked down with the majority of the parts for a 
1.7 liter bus engine.....it would need to be built from the ground up....I think 
the only thing missing is one Solex of the pair.  Now...the question:  What am I 
supposed to do with this stuff?  Too small for Edward....don't have the space 
for a buggy or 'rail....or anything else, for that matter!  There are 
details....the case looks perfect, but one could expect to rebuild the heads, 
install new rings...some bearings/bushings are present...all the 
tin/distributor/alternator/nuts/bolts,etc...seem to be around....no exhaust.
Well?   Is it worth trying to sell as one heap?  Or are there people around who 
need individual parts?  Or.....is this case I have sitting here strong/big 
enough to start building a 2100cc-2250cc motor for Edward?   I am in 
California..north  SF Bay area (Russian River, specifically)

'preciate it...
