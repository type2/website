An important point with driving with propane turned on... what would be
left of you, the VAN, and your family should an accident occur and propane
lines are cut?  This situation is really setting all persons concerned
up for a major explosion.  Propane is not forgiving once she explodes.  It
expands 250 times when exposd to air, and is highly flammable.  It is not
a pretty site to see parts of bodies thrown from such an explosion.  Why
invite disaster for sheer convenience?

Thx.

 I vote with Derek on this one. It has never been demonstrated that using
 the fridge on propane while driving is dangerous. Many current
 refrigerators are only 120V and propane with no 12V at all. If the pilot
 should blow out, the gas will automatically be turned off.

 Exception: when fueling up all flames should be out for safety.
