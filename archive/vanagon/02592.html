With the discussion of of Y'all and English 101-South, I thought
I'd pass the following along:

&quot;So You Don't Know Jack Schitt?&quot;

&quot;He's the only son of Awh Schitt and Oh Schitt. Aw Schitt, the
fertilizer magnate, married Oh Schitt, the owner of the Kneedeep
Schitt Inn. Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. They produced six
children. Holy Schitt, their first, passed on shortly after birty.
Next came twin sons, Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt, two daughters,
Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, and another son, Bull Schitt. Deep
Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. Dip Schitt 
married Lotta Schitt and they have a son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla
Schitta and Giva Schitt married the Happens brothers. The
Schitt-Happens children are Dawg Schitt, Byrd Schitt, and Horace
Schitt. Bull Schitt just married a spicy number, Pisa Schitt, and 
they are awaiting the arrival of baby Schitt.

NOW, you know Jack Schitt!&quot;


Hey, its only Wednesday...and I've only had one mug of Iced
Coffee!!


One other question....&quot;Will Martha be wearing her VW T&amp;A Thong
Bikini while showing off her new solar shower?&quot;
