 Hi all, 
 I have an 82 vanagon, AC I must admit but still a vanagon.  I have a
 question about the gas powered heater in the vanagons.  This is the one
 that operates by the green switch on the dash with TEMP on it.   I think
 they were intended to supplement the heat while the engine warmed??  
 I have owned the van for 1.5 years now and fired it up once.  Black
 smoke and soot poured into the passenger compartment, it wasn't warm
 and cozy but smelly and dangerous. I have never used it since.
 
 My question is how good are these for heat?  Are they reliable?, fire
 hazards? , what maintenance do they require? Are they repairable?
 Should I disect mine to check it out?  Do people use them for heat?  Is
 there hope for this one?  Any insight or other info you may have would
 be appreciated.  Are these the same as the BN4 or BN6s I see talked
 about on the type II list?
 
 Thanks for your help in advance

Looks to me that your heat exchnger is rotted out.  The fumes should never
enter the van.  Normally, these heaters work quite well and can be used to
preheat the van before driving and supplemental heat while drinving if
needed.  Usually the engine will heat the van on it's own except for
extremely cold weater or if driven at low speeds.
