&gt;Subject: F.S. '71 VW Bus (not camper)

&gt;
&gt;I have a '71 regular Bus for sale.  It is in need of restoration, but is
&gt;VERY solid.  I bought it from a guy that had it just sitting in his garage
&gt;for the past 10 years.  So that is why it is so solid.  The engine is out
&gt;right now.  The guy that I bought it from told me that the motor ran when
&gt;he parked it, it just had an oil leak.
&gt;
&gt;It has some dings, but nothing bad.  Some surface rust, but no cancer.  It
&gt;does need a paint job.  It is currently blue on bottom and white on top.
&gt;
&gt;It has brand new tires with NO miles on them.  I took the wheels off and
&gt;carried them to the tire store.
&gt;
&gt;My plan was to do a full restoration on this van, but I just don't have to
&gt;time to mess with it.  Also, my daily driver needs a little bit of work
&gt;right now.
&gt;
&gt;I am asking $500, negitiable.  I am located in Richmond Virginia.  If
&gt;interrested, please e-mail me.
