Eric's comment about his about-to-be-two-year-old-son demanding
to ride in the van is not uncommon overhere....Alex has had his
choice of &quot;herbie&quot; (his name for my '56), &quot;New Bug&quot; (our recently
smooshed convert), and Vokswagin (he cant get the &quot;L&quot; sound yet)
VAN for our Eurovan....

It seems at times that Alex dictates which car WE take when we
go out!
