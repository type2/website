From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

This was in the Richmond, VA Trading Post:

86 Vanagon, 2.1 eng., AT, dual ac, needs heads rebuilt , $1200.00  
804-492-9025.


I called the seller and he said it is a 7 seater and his mechanic said
the pushrods were bent. It is grey with a blue interior. If any listers
are interested I would be happy to check it out for you. It just came
out in the paper today so act fast.
