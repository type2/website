~~wher might one look for a &quot;new&quot; 34 pict carb. i didn't know they were still
_at__at_being manufactured i assumed that the &quot;new&quot; carbs were actually (factory?)
%%rebuilds.

Check your FLARS/FLAPS.  They should have one, and mine double-checked my 
settings to make sure it was okey-dokey.  I've also seen them advertised 
in DB&amp;HWs (&amp;T&amp;A) for about $125-150US.  Mine is made in Mexico by BOCAR 
and runs like a (efficient) champ!
