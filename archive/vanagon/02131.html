Paul,

Looking in the SF Chronicle, I see two:

'89 Westfalia Syncro GL
707-584-1199
Hoch Motors

'87 Westfalia Syncro GL
new engine/tranny
$14.5K
(forgot the phone #)

The '89 is bound to be pricey.  A '90 Vanagon GL (non-syncro) sells for
about $18-20K at the dealer.

Let me know if you're interested in the '87 (I know you're looking for a
newer one).

-Jim
