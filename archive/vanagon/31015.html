FS: Used VW parts for Bugs, Busses, and Ghias
    ---------------
Due to another cold Colorado winter, and lack of
adequate storage, I have decided to sell extra VW parts
from past restoration projects. They include parts from
Bugs, Busses, and Ghias ('56-74) . If I can be of any
assistance wth your project ,please respond via E-mail or
call Josh or Brian at (303) 868-8313, 333-3249. All of the
parts are good, used, German parts fairly priced.
Thanks,
Brian
