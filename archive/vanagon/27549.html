&gt; 1) The adjusters on one of the rear hubs are absolutely solid. I bent my
&gt; screwdriver trying to shift 'em. I guessed it might be a bit rash to
&gt; squirt penetrating oil all over the place :) but how else do I sort it out?

Ok, I don't own a split window bus, but I've seen them on T.V.  Correct 
me, anyone, but what it seems you've gotta do is pull off the brake drum 
and get to the guts of the brakes.  You'll see the little adjusters there 
on the backing plate, so tap them out of there holders, totally clean 
them up, smear 'em with copper grease or whatnot, and reassemble.  Should 
work fine then.  Good luck!
