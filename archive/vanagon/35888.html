Good news!   Thanks Joel and Cheese!

I replaced my CV joints on the right rear side.  It went really smooth.  =
Details follow.

Ordered two joints from Trans Form  ($49 ea......thanks Cheese for the =
info).  They arrived within the week.  Went to FLAPS and bought 6mm =
allen wrench socket and a can of Liquid wrench.

Removal of old joint went smoothly.  I was concerned about rounding out =
the bolt heads, so I waited almost an hour after Liquid wrench =
application b4 attempting removal.  NO Problems!  They came right out.

After removing circlips and old joints, I cleaned the shaft and bolts =
retainer clips until they looked new.=20

I installed the new joints onto the shaft and repacked with moly grease. =
 The hardest part was the reinstallation.  After almost an hour I got =
the joint to align inside the wheel hub shroud. That's a really confined =
space in which to work.

I torqued the bolts to specification and tightened the boots down.  =
That's it.

Cost    2 Joints       $98.00
           tools               3.00
           labor               4 hours....
           six pack   Ranier

I think the two most important parts of project had to be waiting for =
the Liquid Wrench to work and  repacking the assembly in a clean area.

Good Luck and Thanks for everyones input....

Those list stickers are really cool......
