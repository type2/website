Subject: 2d Battery.
Date: Thu, 16 Nov 95 16:20:39 PST

Some wagonmeister mentioned he didn't see any use for a second battery.  I 
installed DC jacks connected to the second battery to power reading lights,
fans, martha's hairdrier, and the chili lights, and the 110vac converter.  They
all run off the second battery.  In addition you can re route the aux power
bus at the fuse box so it too runs off the second battery, isolating the 
radio, ciglighter, and other nonsense such as interior lights from the 
starting battery.

BTW who on the net has put a door light switch in the sliding door on a 
84 and on Westie?
