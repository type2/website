Subject:      (long)Importing Westys for Canadian Citizens

I received a good number of requests for clarification, so I thought I'd
post to the list.  Here goes.

EPA- Two scenarios, and I'll quote from the EPA info packet:

&quot;B. Individuals changing permanent residence from Canada.

All persons (of any nationality, including US citizens) that are changing
their permanent residence from Canada to the U.S. are eligible for an
exemption to import their Canadian vehicles.  EPA considers that a change
of residence is permanent if the importer intends to reside in the U.S. for
at least three years.  The importer must have proof that the vehicle is a
Canadian version and that he or she owned the vehicle prior to changing
residence.  Adequate proof may be a copy of the Canadian title or
registration, or vehicle insurance information in the name of the importer.

Importations for resale are not permitted under this exemption.

No customs bond or approval is required by the EPA.

The importer must file with U.S. Customs, upon entry, an EPA Form 3520-1,
declare code &quot;M&quot; in block 8 of that form, attach proof that the vehicle is
a Canadian version and that the importer owned the vehicle prior to
importation(such as a copy of the vehicle registration or title in the name
of the importer).

C. Sale, gift, or inheritance among family members.

A U.S. resident is eligible for an EPA exemption if an immediate family
member living in Canada gives or sells the U.S. resident a Canadian vehicle
for personal use.  Immediate family members by blood or marriage includes
spouse, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, sister, aunt,
uncle, niece, nephew, or first cousin.  Vehicles purchased specifically for
the gift or sale are not eligible for this exemption.

No customs bond or approval is required by the EPA. The importer must file
with U.S. Customs, upon entry, an EPA Form 3520-1, declare code &quot;M&quot; in
block 8 of that form, and attach a copy of two documents.  The first
document must prove that the vehicle is owned by the Canadian resident,
such as a copy of the vehicle registration or title in the name of the
Canadian resident.  The second document must be a signed letter, invoice,
or other evidence that the Canadian resident is selling or giving the
vehicle to an immediate family member.&quot;

DOT-A little less clear, but VSA-81(a) basically states that all vehicles
under 10,000 lbs GVW less than 25 years old but built before Sept 1, 1991
are eligible, and all vehicle manufactured after that date are eligible if
they comply with FMVSS No 202, 208, and 216.  I didn't research this
because it didn't apply to me.

EPA has an excellent fax-back system to get the proper forms and
procedures, it's slow but I'm local so I didn't mind.  I can snail mail any
documents to interested parties if you e-mail me.  The EPA fax-back number
is 202-233-9660.

DOT has a toll free info number 800-424-9393.

Hope this helps, if we can convince the gov't that we on the list are one
big happy family we'd be set.

Cheers!
