Subject: Turbo Kits for VW 1.9 and 2.1 Engines

I just received this fax from ALPINE Developments in South 
Africa.  Text follows:
------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry for the delay in coming back to you but we habve been
checking the breakers yards for 2.6 engine/transmission
assemblies, so far without success.

Our turbo conversion is currently limited to the fuel
injected engine only and comprises:
   * decompressiong engine (extend depends up9on fuel octane
       level).
   * turbo manifold which connects to the standard (as used 
       in S.A.) header system.
   * Mitsubishi TD84 turbo.
   * All interconnecting piping for air, water, and oil.
   * Free flow silencer.
   * Fuel mixtures, boost pressures etc. are set up on a
       rolling road dynamometer.
   
Parts which we could supply from here are:
   * Turbo manifold.
   * Turbo.
   * Microfueller system and silencer.
Cost would be approximately U.S. $1,824.00 (R7605.00) FOB
Johannesburg Airport.

The fitment and parts modification could be done by an 
experienced mechanic but he would need to understand turbo's 
and how the system worked.

Complete engines are not readily available except on exchange.
--------------------------------------------------------------
   
If anyone is interested, let's get together and discuss.
