Subject: Curtains for me

        Well, today I installed the curtains that my wife made for the
curtain rail kit that I got from Bus Boys.  I had previously installed the
rails so the job only took about two hours.  They look OK (my wife just
said,&quot;better than OK&quot;).  She says to add apx. three hours to cut the
curtains and about fifteen hours to sew them.

        Other than that, the rear bench now unfolds into a bed like platform
(it needs a mattress).  The van came with a incorrectly installed Z-bed kit,
the PO never even mentioned it.  I doubt that he even knew that it was
there.  When unfolded it just barely clears the cabinet that I put in, and I
can still open the cooler that I put behind the passenger seat.  Other than
a small sink (apx. 9&quot;x11&quot; if I can find one) and a stove top for the cabinet
that encloses the cooler I am almost finished with this rendition (second
try) of my camper conversion.
