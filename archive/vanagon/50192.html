Subject: Lost all E-mail........again.

For those of you who have been trying to e-mail me the last few days, please try
again, as I have lost all incoming mail since Saturday.  Just got back from the
Englishtown, NJ show at Raceway Park, late last night. Did not sell the alloy
wheels yet, but gave my number to a bunch of interested people.  Weren't alot of
Vanagon people there, but did talk to a few listmembers.  Breathed in my fair
share of burned rubber from the drag bugs and assorted other makes screaming
down the dragstrip. Two listmembers were going to actually drag race their
Vanagons, a grey '86 or '87 and a brown '85? I spoke with the listmember who had
the '86/'87 but did not get his name.  I wonder who won.
