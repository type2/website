Subject: PNW camping

&gt;I won't be able to make the January trip, but I'd like to go in Feb(on
&gt;Pres. day), so let me know if it's going to happen.  I even bought a new
&gt;sleeping bag for the occasion(REI had a sale:)).  I think Deception Pass
&gt;sounds good, unless the weather is nice.  There is nothing more boring
&gt;than the Washington coast if it's raining.  Hopefully there will be
&gt;electrical outlets, since some of us are still without heaters...

Looks like everyone is bowing out that weekend. Oh well, maybe Deception
Pass in February. As far as I know, they do not have electrical hookups in
Deception Pass, but I don't know for sure - haven't been out there since
mid'80's and I was tent-camping at the time.  There is electric available
out on the coast, at least the spot I was thinking of. Not on the beach
though!

You don't like the coast in the winter? Just need a rainsuit and some duck
shoes. Seriously, there is some good hiking if you can deal with the
weather.
Not much else to do though I must admit. Just have to make/bring your own fun.
