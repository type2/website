&gt; &gt; some types of vehicles have.  For instance, has anyone ever noticed
&gt; &gt; that a VW bus has a short nose?  How do you compensate for this when you
&gt; &gt; drive?  Or do you?  Should the driver/buyer of a vehicle be aware of
&gt; &gt; the shortcomings of the vehicle when they buy it and adjust their
&gt; &gt; behavior accordingly? (i.e. not drive their Van like it was a Porsche)
&gt; 
&gt;     The most dangerous part of any car is the nut behind the
&gt;     wheel... so what if a Thing wouldn't have flipped if the
&gt;     CG was an inch lower? That doesn't sound like glaring
&gt;     design stupidity on VW's part... life ain't Disneyland,
&gt;     things hurt, accidents happen, it hurts, there's blood,
&gt;     it's miserable... try and be safe, that's about the best
&gt;     you can do and reasonably expect...
&gt; 

People refusing to take responsibility for their own actions (the war cry
of the american consumer).  For instance a European maker of chainsaws was
forced to print 2 manuals for their product (even tho both were in
english) one had specific directions &quot;Not to attempt stopping blade with
your hand&quot; and one didn't.  The one without the admonishment was intended
for distribution in Europe, the other for the US market.  No European
would admit in court that he had been so stupid and apparently would be
insulted if you thought he would.  It appears that Americans will sue
anyone for anything at the drop of a hat (watch it it might damage your
toes). Product liability is responsible for completely shutting down the 
manufacture of planes for civil aviation in this country.
