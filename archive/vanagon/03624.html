Subject: RE: '71 T2 VIN

&gt; There is something curious about the VIN on my newly acquired bus.  The vin on 
&gt; the bus matched the one on the title, but don't cross reference with a couple 
&gt; of sources, namely Muirs book, and the Bus Stop (RMMW).  My vin starts out 
&gt; 2212XXXXXX.  There is a date of manufacture sticker on the door jamb which says 
&gt; 6/71.  Well, the vin is well past the last numbers on the reference list.  

Those lists always plug in &quot;1&quot; for the second digit, even though 
that number is variable (can be 1 through 8 for a bus, I 
believe).  So, pretend it's &quot;2112xxxxxx.&quot;

The best I can figure from several sources (not all of which are
complete or consistent, and may be somewhat wrong), Model 21 is
the delivery van (including high roof), 22 is Kombi (3 side
windows, no interior trim), 23 is Micro Bus (3 side windows,
interior trim), 24 is Micro Bus De Luxe (4 side windows, grills
on windows around luggage compartment, chrome VW emblem, clock,
aluminum trim), 25--I don't know (camper?), 26 are the various
pick-ups, 27 is the ambulance, and 28--I don't know. 

According to a recent column in Hot VWs, you could get the 
sunroof on models 22, 23, and 24.

I'd like to see more precise info on this, if anyone knows.
