Subject: best manual for my '78?


Hi everyone -

What's the best manual for my '78 Bus?  I have the Bentley's one
but I'd love one that only covers my year (or at least just the
2000cc fuel injected years) and/or one with better coverage of
fuel injection (more pictures and diagrams needed!!).

Any ideas?

Thanks,
  Tim Burnett ('Janet Martinson' of the header is my wife :) )
