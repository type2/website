Subject: hatch struts: INSTALLED!
Date: Thu, 2 Jan 97 11:50:22 -0600

i just installed the struts over lunch break.  here's the results:

what was *on* the van were 2 high pressure struts!  only one had blown but
it was enough to not keep the hatch open at all.

what i put on was the XXX-332 (low pressure) on the right and the XXX-331 B
(high pressure) on the left.  it works.  the hatch does not raise on its own
but it does stay put pretty much where ever you position it.  when fully
lifted, it takes a light pressure to bring it down.  definately lighter than
what it was before with the 2 high pressure struts (before one blew out).

which is better?  with a high/low pressure strut mix, it is easier to lower
the hatch (my wife will like that) but it subjectively 'feels' like there is
little margin for weakening of the struts before the hatch begins to sag.  i
dunno.  i have one good, used high pressure that i'll keep as a spare if
that happens.

either way is okay but i DEFINATELY wouldn't put 2 low pressure ones on.  i
think the hatch would sag.
