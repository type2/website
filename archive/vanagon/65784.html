Tom is not currently subscribed to the Vanagon List, so I  post this for
him:

Subject:Wash, DC 87 GL Auto trans w/Alloys for auction Thursday

At Goodwill Industries at 11:00 AM on Thursday. Located at 2200 South
Dakota Ave, NE., Washington DC. Inspection is 10:00 AM, sale starts at
11:00. $100 cash deposit req'd for bidding. (202) 636-4225 for directions.

I do the computer support work over at Goodwill, and I noticed this van in
the auction lot yesterday. Gold color, no dents or rust. Interior looks to
be very good to excellent. These vehicles are donated to Goodwill (charity)
for their auction. The reason donors give the cars away is for the tax
write-off, and usually because the car needs repair. I did not see any
leaks or white crust  on the heads, so maybe this has a trans problem. I
would expect the selling price to be less than $1000.
