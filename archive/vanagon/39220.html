Subject: Stickers removed - thanks!

Thanks to all for the advice...I gently warmed the glass with hot water on
cloth (afraid of cracking it with direct heat) then used the razor blade and
patience. But it worked real well and even got the gunk off as well.
So..sparkling clean glass pop out now awaits a suitable sticker of our choice)
Thanks again    Dave
