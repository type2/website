Gregg, there is a small black box underneath the van near the driver's wheel 
well. It is basically under the speedometer and you can see the cable coming 
out of it (when you are lying underneath the van). On the front side is a 
small button you depress into the box to reset the O2 counter. There is no 
intelligent connection to the O2 sensor or fuel/ox control system.

&gt; I guess if I have to ask this question then I am one of those people
&gt; who need
&gt; the light. My O2 sensor idiot light in the dash of my 85 Vanagon
&gt; came on. I
&gt; replaced the O2 sensor in the exhaust but can't figure out how to
&gt; reset the
&gt; idiot light. Can anyone tell me how to reset this indicator?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, with a new O2 sensor and not resetting the idiot light, could
&gt; this have
&gt; an affect on my problem of running too rich a fuel mixture?
