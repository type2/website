&gt;It's much better for the ignition system if you wire the stereo to a
&gt;fuse that has power when the key is off.  There is a circut that you can
&gt;use and that is the door buzzer, there only has to be a key in the
&gt;ignition switch, this is a little harder than finding a live circut and
&gt;wireing to that one!


How about mounting an extra switch on the dash, maybe with an itty bitty
LED next to it to remind you when it's on? Flasher-type LED for reduced
current, do your battery a favor.

If that's too normal for you, try this one on for size:

Get one of those timer-type switches from a bus, type-4, or Thing that
has/had a gas heater, and mount it in your dash. Want to play the radio
while your engine is stopped, but don't want to risk forgetting to turn
it off and walking home the next day? A hefty twist on the timer knob,
and you get 30 minutes of music, or whatever the max is for those
rotary-timer switches.


Personally, though, I like the door-buzzer idea better. Not only do you
guarantee shutting it off when you remove the key, but you get rid of
that MISERABLE buzzer to boot. A win-win situation!
