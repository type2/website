Subject: Best Value Auto Clubs?

Hi,

Still planning our trip from New Mexico to California and I'm wondering
what opinions ya'll may have on auto clubs like AAA?   Recently, Chevron
has been calling trying to get me to join as well.  I've never been a
member of any but have been thinking that towing, overnight lodging, etc.
might be nice to have w/o having to worry about claiming on my regular
insurance policy.

Thanks,
Ivan  '85 Westy
