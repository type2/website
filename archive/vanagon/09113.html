Great story, Todd! (I tried mailing this directly to you, but it bounced
back)

I have/drive/maintain/love a '71 Superbeetle that my wife bought from
her sister in '76--her first car!  Her sister bought it new off the lot
in '71.  It's now approaching 200kmi, and runs better than any other
car I now have (excepting the Bus)!

I've had my '71 Westfalia for about 4 years now, and drive it daily to
work; from Sedona to Flagstaff and back.  I work in a rather remote area,
and I really enjoy having my lunch in it, and taking in the spectacular
scenery.  I've also been able to sneak in a nap or to on the folded down
bed--it makes the rest of the day very pleasant!  

I always carry some spare parts, lots of tools, tire chains, extra gasoline,
camping equipment, freeze-dried food, a backpack stove w/fuel, water, 
sleeping bag, extra clothes, etc, etc, etc....I could stay on the road for
several days, if I needed to (hopefully, I won't)!

What advantage is there to having AZ vintage vehicle plates?  I've been 
considering this myself for some time (I still have CA plates on my cars,
even though I've been here several months).

Hope you enjoy the list as much as I do!
