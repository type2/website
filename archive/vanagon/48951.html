Subject: Will Start

Thank uou Joel Walker,Steve Johnson,Eric Zeno,Malcomb, David Carmet &amp; 
others for responding to &quot;no start&quot;  Trouble was rusty water in 25 pin 
computer connection.  Dried &amp; cleaned pins &amp;sockets,but #'s 12,13,&amp;25 
are rusty &amp; weak. Van now runs with bad(?) O2 sensor.Can't buy 
connectors only.  Volkswagen sells whole harness for $700,and Bosch 
doesent list.Any thoughts welcomb.   seems water follows wires in 
harnessinto computer in cars and in my garaged Vanagon.  Maybe in others 
that won't start. Rawson Murdock
