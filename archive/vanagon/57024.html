Subject: What do you keep in your bus?

Howdy,

Along the lines of the great &quot;What do you have in your Powerbook?&quot; ads, I'm
starting a &quot;What do you have in your bus?&quot; web page.  Send in your
submissions!  I'm going to illustrate this page with as many pictures as I
can find of the folks on the page, so if you have a picture of yourself
online, let me know where I can get it!

Ron
