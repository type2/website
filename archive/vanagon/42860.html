Subject: Re: engine seal/tin holes

Terry Tan asks my favorite question -- how'd you put that six in that Vgon,
Bill?  Terry is in NJ, I gather, so he can come look.  For others, the
following sequence is pretty generic no matter what non-stock engine is 
used:
1.  Acquire non-stock engine.
2.  Acquire adapter flywheel (and adapter plate if needed); mount on engine.
3.  Strip exhaust and induction systems off engine.
4.  Mount engine to transmission and jack into position.
5.  Figure out how to hold up back end of engine.  (My careful measurements
before the engine was actually up in the car were only of conceptual value.
Once the engine is there, you really see what needs to be done.)
6.  Figure out how to solve each of the other linkages (e.g. throttle, oil
tank, ignition, space for induction system, heater ducts, exhaust, engine
compartment air seal, vacuum for power brakes, fuel line and return)

The main value of examples like mine I think is to demonstrate that there are
no show-stopper problems.
