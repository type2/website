very true. but that's the problem in the south: limited public transportation.
nobody has any decent buses or schedules or routes.

and riding a bicycle or even a motorbike in this town with these students
and other idiots driving on the road ... no way, Jose! that's sheer suicide!
just on campus, there are at least two accidents each week involving bikes
and cars ... i'll let you guess which one is in worse shape afterward.

that's really the problem with all of america, i guess: the city government
sucks up to business, especially real estate, and everything is built with
more roads and houses and malls and stores ... all depending on automobiles.

and we all get lazy as we get older ...wanting more conveniences and luxuries.
and mostly to stay warm and dry. ;)

even in chicago, when i lived only 300 yards from work, it was impossible to
walk in the winter ... way too much chance of frostbite. so i had to drive
my beetle about a mile on the streets to get there. that sometimes 45 minutes
if i left too late. :(

sometimes, i think you just can't win.

joel
fat and lazy, not really crazy. ;)
