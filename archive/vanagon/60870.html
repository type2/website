Subject: Power Mirrors

Recently I have been tracking a thread on Kelly Bauman's power mirror 
woes.  This thread got me thinking (danger ahead!!! look out!! ) why 
can't I have power mirrors on my 84 ? My Granpappy taught me to use 
two sets of mirrors and I my arms arn't long enough to adjust the 
right one from the drivers' seat.  So I ask you, has any one done 
this mod? or will I be the first?
