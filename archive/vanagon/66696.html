Subject:      Used parts sale - Bus and Vanagon

Hi all:

Last March I posted about Bud's Bugs, a VW-only wreaking yard in Concord,
CA, that was having a &quot;$20 Sale.&quot;  I offered to find and ship parts while
the sale was on, and several people got some parts they were needing.

I wandered back into Bud's Bugs today, and they're having their &quot;$20
Sale&quot; again; their flyer for the sale says &quot;$20 For-Just-About-Anything
In-The-Yard SALE.  (excludes complete engines, cars and 1985 and newer
parts.)&quot;

Unlike last time, I'm not going back out that way anytime soon (didn't
find anything I need) but I was told they have a web site
(www.budsbugs_dot_com) so you can email them with any requests.  (I was also
told they will ship smaller parts UPS.)

They didn't seem to have a ton of Bus and Vanagon stuff, but they had
some, including what looked to be a complete '71 camper with pop-top, so
you might get lucky.

Usual disclaimers: I have no association, affiliation, relationship,
kinship, or any other sort of tie-in to Bud's Bugs; I've bought stuff
there a few times and that's it.  Maybe if you mention my name in your
emails I can get a parts discount!!! :-)

(I'm guessing that the $20 price is also limited to a &quot;you pull-it&quot;
situation, but who knows?)
