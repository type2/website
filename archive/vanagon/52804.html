 Although I haven't pulled the trans on my Vanagon, I've removed the engine
 many times.  In reading my manual before each &quot;pull&quot; I'm reminded that the
 engine/trans can be removed as a unit; it doesn't seem very complicated or
 very hard.  (A lot of this, however, depends on your own mechanical
 experience and your willingness/ability to read and follow directions in a
 manual. &gt;&gt;


Transmission is easier to remove thna engine.  In Vanagons, engine can remain
in place.  I use a bar across the top to support the front of the engine
while the trans is out.
