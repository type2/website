We wouldn't have had to heard about last night's tragedy if our so-called 
elected representatives in Washington DC had some minimum amount of 
testicular fortitude and did what the rest of the industrialized countries 
do and that is mandate the use of seatbelts.

Instead, we have to spend an additional $1,500 per car for something that 
was not propely thought out, obviously is deadly to kids (as well as those 
adults of below-average height), and is only in our cars because most 
drivers are stupid enough NOT to wear seat belts. All in the name of &quot;personal 
choice&quot;...bullshit...
