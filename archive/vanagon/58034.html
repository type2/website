Subject: Late night on the backroads of Georgia....

Well, it finally happened.  I got lost while attempting to drive home 
after dark with my 3 girls.  I have a pretty poor sense of direction 
anyway, and I took a wrong turn in the outskirts of Columbus, GA. 
I couldn't believe I was so dumb as to start out at 9:30 pm to make 
the 65 mile drive back to Thomaston after I found myself in the 
backwoods on Hwy 80 with less gas in the tank than I would have 
liked.  I had no idea where we were headed and figured we would 
either end up in Alabama, or the extreme southern end of our lovely 
state. 

I just said a prayer and told my daughter to get out the map (and the 
trusty flashlight) to navigate us home.  I keep maps of all the 
neighboring states in the glove compartment but at first glance, 
Michelle couldn't find the Georiga map! : 0   Of course, it was in 
there under the Callaway gardens map, the Six Flags map, and the 
Macon city map.

I wouldn't have been quite as anxious if my VW hadn't been skipping 
and hopping lately while I am idling.  I have been intending to 
change out the fuel filter since I have already changed the 
transmission fluid &amp; gaskets, tuned it up and replaced the rotor, 
distributor cap and other parts.  I haven't been traveling  very far 
for the past month.  After all the talk recently about gas tank 
corrosion, I am beginning to think that might be my problem as this 
Vanagon had been sitting for a couple of years when I bought it.

Still it is amazing how comforting it is to know that if you indeed 
HAD to spend the night on the side of the road, you would have all 
the comforts of &quot;home&quot;. The fridge was well-stocked with sandwiches, 
deviled eggs from the picnic (Easter eggs, of course)  and cold iced 
tea.    (By the way, do any others on the list keep 
their fridge fired with the propane all the time?)  I had even loaded back up
the portapotty PLUS I was able to dial up the folks at home that 
might be missing us on the cellular phone (yes, Joel, I talked and 
drove at the same time...but I WAS on the backroads!).  Even the 
sleeping bags are kept loaded and it has been chilly here the last 
few nights in the 40's.

Old &quot;Happy&quot; made it home an hour behind schedule with sleeping 
chil'uns in the backseat!  I have made a new rule to only drive home 
long distances if I have plenty of daylight.  I wish I could be more 
trusting of people, but it's mighty scary to be lost on a dark, 
country road when you have little ones to consider the safety of!
