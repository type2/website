Subject: Clicking Odometer, 85GL

all this talk of odometers...
mine clicks as the cable spins.

other vehicles i've always just lubed the cable at the top and presto.
Bentley says don't do this on the vanagon.

maybe i'm off base in thinking of cable first.  just that clicking's always
been cable caused in my (limited) experience.

anyone had this, had any success fixing it?
