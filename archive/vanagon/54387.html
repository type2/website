&gt; So what if someone is making money with this list.

As a trained economist, I have learned to welcome free trade and as a
corollary I also welcome the presence on the list of those who offer
parts and services for money; consumers can take it or leave it and
only engage in those transactions voluntarily. In fact,
run-o'-the-mill economists would probably predict that if *everyone*
on this list behaved mercantilistically, charged what they could and
paid what they had to, we might all generally be better off (this
counter-intuitive proposition has always been hard to teach to
undergraduates).

However, most people on the list play by a different set of rules,
offer their help and services, photocopies of manuals, and even
parts(!) for *free* and only expect the same in return. They hope,
that over time, checks and balances pretty much even out.
Understandably, tempers flare when some are perceived to
systematically take more than they give in return...

I don't see a miracle solution, but wish list members would clearly
signal by which set of rules they play. For instance, don't tell me
you're selling a bus because your wife wants to clear the driveway,
when in fact, you're advertising a new bus FS every month or two. 

I have adapted to the situation by charging people what I think they
would charge me.

My 2 cents,

-Sami
