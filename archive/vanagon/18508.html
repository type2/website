Ben (and the List)

Just to keep the record straight, it was Danang, the work was done on the
transmission on an itty bitty Pratt Whitney turbine in a Helio Courier (the
CIA's version of a Piper Cub) and it was Poker Night at the Chief's Club at
Camp Tien Sha.  (War is hell... if you miss your poker night :-)
