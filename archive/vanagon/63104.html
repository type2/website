Subject:      Radio static in 84 GL

When our radio gave up the ghost in our '84 GL some years ago, we installed a
new cassette/radio combination.  Whenever I turn on the heater fan it
interferes with all the AM stations.  (The FM stations are fine.)  Has any
one else had this problem?  Could it be our amateur installation (performed
by a member of this family who wishes to remain anonymous).
 We are about to purchase a new cassette/radio combination for our other
Vanagon ('86 GL).  Is there anything we can do to prevent this from happening
again?  (Yes, we are considering a professional installation.)  :-}
