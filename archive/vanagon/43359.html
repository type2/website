Subject: Cleaning drums.

Hello all, what would you reccommend I use to clean the inside surface of
my front drums ('66) after unsticking them from the old brake shoes?
Don't worry, I've got new shoes to put on.  I'm thinking of a fine grade
sandpaper but I don't want to gouge the drums.
Thanks
-Erik.
