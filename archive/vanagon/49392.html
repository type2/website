In regards to taking the belt off the compressor.  I've heard that it is
unwise to take your belt off completely.  Apparently the seals in the A/C
system are lubricated by the Freon itself.  This helps them stay soft and
retain their sealing qualities.  If you don't use your A/C or take the belt
off, the seals dry out and the Freon leaks out and no A/C.  I run my A/C on
my '89 Jetta once a week all year and it still works like the day I got it. 
Never been recharged.  Perhaps its unrelated....any ideas on this theory?

Thanks
