&gt; &gt;&gt;Also- since I am chief designer of the cabinets I am looking for
&gt; &gt;&gt; suggestions on the ultimate layout and configuration. I would gladly
&gt; &gt;&gt; listen to any advice about what you would add / subtract from your
&gt; &gt;&gt; current setup.

I disliked having a built in stove.  I also prefer to sit across a table
from my dining partner.  My first bus, a 67 Camper of USA I believe it
was, had the icebox/sink right behind the passenger seat.  I installed a
plywood wall from sink unit to ceiling.  Good for hanging things.  Behind
the driver's seat was a seat with storage under it.  The clothes cabinet
was on the passenger side behind the swing out doors.  The bed/couch was
up against the driver's side.  The table swung up between the two facing
seats.  Inside cooking involved putting a stove on the table or sink
behind the passenger seat.  I liked the option of taking the propane stove
outdoors and having easy access to the icebox from outside.  I also liked
the &quot;cozy&quot; feeling of having the cabinets on the passenger side.  This
setup felt like I could integrate indoor and outdoor living more
effectively.

I also owned an 82 diesel in which I installed the westphalia interior.
It felt awkward and an inefficient use of space.  I didn't like the swing
out table.  I found I prefered being able to cook outside.  This setup
also felt &quot;exposed&quot; more than the 67's setup.  Definitely an opinion
here...
