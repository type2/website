Subject: Re: 84 VVanagon GL: Coolant stays in Round Coolant Reservoir

&gt;I have a strange occurrence wherein the coolant, after the engine has cooled
&gt;down won't go into the 2ndary coolant reservoir (the square-ish one next to
&gt;the oil dipstick).  
&gt;
&gt;Rather, the coolant stays in the main coolant reservoir (the more-spherical,
&gt;less squarish-one on the corner of the engine compartment near the left rear
&gt;blinkers).
  
When the coolant gets hot it expands into the expansion tank. When it cools
down after the engine is shut off, the coolant is sucked out of the
expansion tank and back into the main reservoir. Whether hot or cold, the
expansion tank should never be empty.
