Subject: RE: window seals?

I've just replaced ALL the seals for all the fixed windows on my 21 window
deluxe.  Let's see... thats 12 windows - opps, I didn't do the rear that
look v.g.  I bought the seals  through RMMW - the Bus Stop. I hope these
will perform well....

minimally researched,
christian
