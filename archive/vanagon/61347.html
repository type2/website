Subject: More Friday maintenance humor

The following is allegedly an ACTUAL ALERT to Unisys field engineers
that was sent out recently.  It pertains to a certain computer
accessory part replacement.  It went out to some Unisys branch
offices.  The person who wrote it was quite serious and evidently
didn't see the humor in it!!!

 ********************************************

Mouse balls are now available as replacement parts.  Therefore, if a
mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a
ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of this procedure,
replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by trained
personnel.

Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the
underside of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and harder than
foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ depending on the
manufacturer of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be replaced using the
pop-off method.  Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist-off
method.  Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive.  However,
excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.  Upon completion of
ball replacement the mouse may be used immediately.

It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for
maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any customer
missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these
necessary items.

To reorder, specify one of the following:

  P/N 33F8462--domestic balls
  P/N 33F8461--foreign balls
