Subject: Just how purple is &quot;Her Majesty?&quot; (was Something Positive...)
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

Just HOW purple is yer bus?

Let's see... 

&gt;From the rain gutter down, &quot;Her Majesty&quot;  is deep - midnight - royal - 
sparkly - twinkly - pearl PURPLE! Kinda like the color of deep purple 
satin - or velvet... the way you'd expect Merlin's robe to look. At 
night she looks pearl black - in direct sunlight she looks bright 
purple - magenta... and in low light, she's the deepest royal purple 
you've ever seen. Almost like jewels... not flat or brazen...or 
powdery...

&gt;From the rain gutter up, she is &quot;Kozmic Blue&quot; to quote the paint 
manufacturer... which is to say, midnight pearl turquoise... I think 
some people would refer to it as electric blue, but it's pearl, not 
metalic.

Both colors are covered with 7 coats of clear urathane... and that give 
it a depth that defies description.

She represents the surfing sunsets of my life as a surfer chick... 
Before I had a car, starting when I was about 12, after school - I 
would  ride my bike to the beach - pulling my board on a rikshaw - and 
surf the glass off till it was dark... it was at that time  I fell in 
love with the deep purple and turquoise of  surfing sunsets. The only 
thing &quot;Her Majesty&quot; is missing is the electric 
orange/golden/silver/pink streak  between the water and the sky... and 
since I'm not into pin-striping - that small detail remains my secret. 

I had a custom surfboard built those colors when I was 16 - and have 
always thought they would look beautiful on just the perfect car. 

Well, after going through a few not-so-perfect cars, I landed the bus 
of my dreams 10 years ago.  With 28,000 original miles, she had been in 
storage since 1972, and was so clean, her original window sticker was 
in the glove box - along with the original owner's manual, and the 
funny  little rolled up tool kit - that accompanied her all the way 
from Wolfsberg  across the big pond. Once in the US, she was shipped  
to Aero Volkswagen in Inglewood, CA - where she was purchased and 
driven immediately to the eastern sierra. This place is a veritable 
desert... the rain shadow to beat all rain shadows... and  although we 
get plenty of precip, in the form of snow... it rarely passes through 
its liquid state, so... rust just doesn't exsist here... thus the 
success of our local ghost town / state park - Bodie. The buzz word 
there is that everything is in a state of &quot;arrested decay&quot;... meaning, 
the metal never rusts, and every 25 years, or so,  they have to fix up 
the wood a little. (Imagine what this climate is doing to my skin! 
Besides Volkwagen parts, my biggest expense is Lancome skin care 
products!  :-) )

So... she ain't got much rust... that's for sure.

Funny thing happened one day - actually the day she was finished. I had 
to go to the local high school to meet our food co-op group - and pick 
our order up from the 18 wheeler. As soon as I pulled in, everybody 
started aplauding and cheering... one friend yelled... 

&quot;I didn't know you meant PURPLE - PURPLE! KILLER, DUDE!&quot;

Then, out of the crowd hurried a darling guy, complete stranger... and 
he dashed to the bus, got down on his back, and slithered underneath 
her. He just kept saying, over and over:

&quot;Look at this under carriage... will you look at this under carriage!&quot;

I'm thinking... 

&quot;Dude, I put almost 5 times her original sticker price into fixing her 
up, and all you can do is look at the under carriage?&quot;  Go figure!

Well, in Zion, on her first road trip... 3 other people, all at 
different times, came into our campsite and did the same thing... I was 
dumbfounded! So, when Blanchard finished his 3 day wall climb, I asked 
him what these guys were looking at. He proceeded to take me under the 
bus and show me... and, in his words, he told me that they were all 
looking to see if I really had a clean bus, or if I had only put a 
band-aid on it.  :-)

We've done a professional photo shoot of her, and I have a query letter 
in to HotVWs and VW Trends about selling them an article about her... 
haven't heard anything yet. If they don't accept an article, then I'll 
scan a couple of the images, and post a gif or two. Do you guys allow 
that? Just a thought.

Well, off to the deck, we're getting so much snow, I have to shovel 
about every hour.

P.S. You know, &quot;Her Majesty&quot; isn't her real name... I've been sorting 
though all kinds of names - and really haven't come up with one... 
until I started writing to you guys about her. Is &quot;Her Majesty&quot; a 
little weird? I kinda like it. What - a - ya - think? I'm certainly 
open to suggestions. I thought about calling her a foreign translation 
of purple - but so far Tsi - chinese - and the Japanese...which was 
misamura - or something like that  - haven't set well with me... The 
upholsterer who did the Victorian Italian tapestry interior said 
sitting in her was like being in the Ritz - so he thought of Ritzy. And 
Carlton is a guy's name! And Blanchard, who albiet younger than I, the 
only true hippie in the family,  thought of Purple Haze... A little too 
obvious! Then there came the suggestion of Violet....  &quot;Her Majesty&quot; 
surfaced only a couple days ago - and I'm starting to like it. Whatever
