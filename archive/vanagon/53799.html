 ----------
Happy New Year!

'91 Vanagon GL, 79,000 miles, 4 speed, 7 passenger, AC, red, 14&quot; wheels,   
power mirrors.
I took a look at it and it looked clean in and out.  I would have driven   
it but I am somewhat disabled and stick-shifting is very difficult for   
me.  The heads have been already done and the guy, who also happens to be   
my VW mechanic, is asking 5995.  Please contact him at:

Hackel's VW Service
1347 Central Avenue
Albany, NY
518-458-2897
