Subject: How do I DIGEST this stuff???

OK, I've tried to do it and I keep getting messages about unkown 
commands. I've been told to send a note to the above address, leave 
blanks in the subjext line and enter a one line note which says:	

set vanagon mail digest

Is this right? Does it have to be in caps?	

Thanks in advance,
