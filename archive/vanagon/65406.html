Subject:      Opinion Submitted (Re: Request for opinions)

i'd personally get a 91-92 Westphalia Synchro (if i could find one) but a
91-92 Westphalia is a great choice (my friend has one and has had no
major(engine, tranny.) problems.  also, he speaks highly of the
Westphalia package for its useability and practicality.

but you don't have to take my word for it....

good luck.

&gt; Confirmation? Arguments?  Recommendations?
