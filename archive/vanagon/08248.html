Subject: fog lights



&gt;	   P.S.  If you are worried about power, my '78 powers all lights
&gt;		 and a cd player with two amps just fine.
&gt;
That must be one hell of a cd player to draw 2 amps _at_ 12 Volts...  You could
also use it as a hand warmer in a pinch  (seriously, my crude soldering
iron uses a 30W coil)!!!

Or, is it one of them CD changer units?  I've been thinking of getting one
for the EV -- the EV came with a CD-changer ready stereo, with the
changer controls, etc.. I would like to find out if anyone out there has 
fitted a non-dealer priced CD changer in their EVs...
