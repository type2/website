Subject: ECU Recall?
Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1997 10:03:01 -0500

Hi All,

I have yet to turn up definitive proof that VW actually recalled the
digifant ECU's.

I've confirmed that VW did revise the digifant several times throughout
each production year and that all Vanagon Digifant ECU's are
interchangeable. The difference being that each later model is presumably
better.

So, if anybody actually has a VW recall number, PLEASE POST IT!

I've searched the archives and found lots of info, lots of numbers, but no
official VW recall number.

Thanks for the time and help!

tony

btw - I ended up buying a used ECU from a '90 for $200, haven't gotten it
in the mail yet.
