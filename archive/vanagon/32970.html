Subject: next CA campout


Ok, that does it.  Five people have now asked me for the next campout
time/location, so I guess it's &quot;that time again.&quot;  We have interest from
the crazy bay area as usual, plus more than usual interest from southern
CA, so I'm going to suggest something at the midway point between the
two locations. 

We've camped where it's been hot, medium, and cool, but we've not yet camped
where it's been REALLY cold, aka in the snow.  I'm game if all of you are, but
I suspect we'd do well to get a place with some AC for heaters for those
of us who do not have Dave Garth's lovely heater setup.  

So, what I'm thinking is maybe an area as east as Yosemite, but more
south, like Sequoia?  Kautzes  - you were there recently, is there
any place that you think would tolerate...er let us in?  :)  All
other suggestions welcome, too, just so long as the recordkeeping on this
doesn't start to grow hair.

Also needed are date suggestions.  How about I make a few, and you all
can respond in a democratic fashion?  Here's for starters:

Feb 16-18
Feb 23-25
Mar 1-3
Mar 8-10

Lemme know - I'll crunch the incoming data as best as I can...

Yes, I still am lusting after a DC/12v coffee-grinder and daily hot showers!
