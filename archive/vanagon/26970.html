Subject: I need a camper

All,

I was looking for a camper a while ago, and now my wife says we need a
camper, in good running condition before May 1996. She wants to go to
Disney World, and we do not want to fly, we want to drive, and camp. Why
drive my chevy with a coleman popup trailer, when I could drive and camp
in a VW Westy, camper or some such vehicle.  Soooooo, what I need is
this:
Westy or camper conversion(poptop) year unimportant - canvas important!
As long as it is repairable

Interior - all present, and working, don't care what it looks like, as
long as it is there, and the stove, sink, cooler work, or are in easily
repairable condition.

Exterior - minimal rust(I realize it will be there, just no big holes,
or structural weaknesses), door dings are understandable, major dents -
depends

Engine - would be nice, but unimportant

Trans - please? working condition

Suspension - as long as it is not about to call it quits, I can replace
bushings, etc.

Electrics - I can fix most, but not all systems

Glass - present(cracks I can deal with, breakage depends on what type of
preventative measures have been taken to keep the weather out.

Distance from Austin -Albequrque, NM to the west, Memphis TN to the
north, Jackson MS to the east. Will travel farther if the
price/condition is right.

Price - can't spend alot, but will consider any, and all offers.

Feel free to email me at goldberg_david_at_isd.tandem_dot_com, or call
512/219-6614 mornings, 512/432-8770 evenings.

Regards,

David
