&gt;&gt; If, on the other hand, you want to make VW suffer for their mistakes you

&gt;&gt; with VWoA and deal with the arbitration of the class action settlement
&gt;&gt; business. 

To make VW suffer? Maybe, but remember as a vanagon owner we are the ones
that suffer from their mistake in the first place.

I strongly feel that they are obligated to fix this westy for me as the FTC
order stated. Yes, my westy is 13 years old. But it had the problem way
back when it was as young as 46k miles. It is only 61k miles young today.
The reason it is this young is because of the problem it has been mostly
parked fearing further damage if continuing to drive it.

Believe it or not this westy's propane tank has been filled only once in 13
years and it still has propane in it. The frige has been used, well should say 
tested, when the westy was new and then has never been fired (for 10 years). 
The popup top was opened perhaps only a dozen times. 

I bought it from a very close friend of mine who had to leave the country 
and left me to deal with the engine problem. I bought my 84 vanagon and he
bought this westy at about the same time. I watched him suffering from 
it for a long time until he unloaded it to me. I parked it since I bought
it 3 years ago. Until I learned the fact that it has the head gasket problem
and the FTC thing from this list then I eventually have the faith that it can
be fixed (I thought there is no cure for it) and in fact I can ask VW to
fix it for me.

So I am going after VWoA to fix it for me and pay at least 80% of the bill.
Hope this is clear to you now. At the time I am writing this up my 84 vanagon
is dripping coolant too. About nearly a quart a week...
