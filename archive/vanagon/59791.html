&lt;&lt; The XT6 engine is not considered to be a prime candidate for a Vanagon
 swap. It only makes about 145 horses and does not have a counterbalanced
 crank. The Legacy 4/2.2L puts out 130HP or 160HP in turbo form. Kennedy
 now has a full kit for this conversion. If your heart is set on a six,
 hunt around for the 3.3L out of the SVX, hard to find, but puts out
 230HP and 229Ft/Lbs.

Actually, Subaru's 1996 and newer 2.5L 4 cyl makes 155 HP-no turbo.  Seems
the perfect candidate to me.
