Drove the van today  it felt and ran great   it was our first 70 degree day
of the year   
Man I luv my van   the new mechanic Hendriks in Middletown  adjusted
everything
correctly   I never had everything right before    What a difference
   anyway  2 things came up   
1}  with the windows open a crack  rollin at 70mph om I 84 we got a strong
smell of coolant   all levels were fine and temp was perfect    had to close
windows   what causes this ?
2]  saw a small puddle under engine after Iparked for a while   thiught new
head was leakin  but it was fine , seems to be from water pump   but it
was'nt coolant  leakin   it was like dirty water     again all levels were
fine   temp oil and coolant level perfect     what am i leakin   also if it's
the pump going why no knocking sound like american car pumps make when there
shot
