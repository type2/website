Subject: aux oil cooler as heater core?

Here's a silly idea I just had, knowing nothing about these issues: If
a watercooled engine pumps coolant through a heater core, could the
same be done to provide heat from an auxilliary oil cooler on an
aircooled engine?  Why or why not?  Is it simply because no-one ever
engineered such a beast, so they don't exist?  Or is there some
fundamental problem, like this setup would cool the oil too much, or
you could never run a pump strong enough to force the oil through the
heater core?  Or would it be such a high-pressure hydraulic system
that a small pinhole leak would turn into a Sawsall and destroy
anything in its path?

It seems to me that the 4 cylinders of an engine must produce
(roughly) the same amount of heat, regardless of whether that heat is
carried away via air or water.  Then the problem of heating an
aircooled vehicle must be one of heat exchange, not heat availability.
Am I right or wrong?

Just kickin' it around...
Rodney
