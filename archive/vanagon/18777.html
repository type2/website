Hi Mike-

I appreciate your open VW mind.  My pocket book isn't as open as I'd like it
to be (no lottery win...) but I'd love to know more about the 17k Syncro in
case it's my perfect wish.

I am concerned with rust, mechanical problems- and cost, etc., but I know I
must look a lot.

Your wish should be easier.  I'll try to help.

Thanks     ;-)
