Subject: More on leaky head gasket (wasserboxer)

I picked up my '91 Vanagon after having it's 60,000 mile service and
a few other things. I had a good chat with the &quot;service advisor&quot;. When
I asked him how he knew the head gasket was leaking, he said that there
was coolant leaking out/dripping from around the head. So, it turns out
that is *not* oil and coolant mixing, so now it really sounds like the
classic head gasket leak problem. (The service advisor admitted that he
wasn't too clear on the phone when he explained the whole thing.)

I asked him what could cause this to happen at such low mileage. He
looked pretty embarrassed and said that if he was an engineer he could
probably explain it, but he kinda sorta hinted that it should not have
happened particularly given the extra care I have taken on the cooling
system. He recommended contacting VWoA and pleading my case. He said he
wouldn't be surprised if they paid for something like half of the repair.

As for the repair, here's what he said. The right head gasket is leaking
and the left is ok. The gasket kit is $190 per side. When the mechanic
pulls the head, he'll know if the head needs replacing due to pitting,
but he said that almost always it will need replacing ($560 for the head).
(He sounded like he's seen this before!) He very strongly recommended
replacing the left side gasket since I'd probably be back in six months
to have that one done anyway. The left side head may be ok, but he wouldn't
know until it's off. Labor for the whole job is 13 hours _at_ $52/hr. Total
cost with two gasket kits, two heads, and labor: $2200. Ouch, ouch, ouch!

You know, the whole time I talked with him, I got the feeling he was
drawing on a significant pool of cases like this, i.e., he'd seen it
before and not just once or twice.

So, now to write a letter to VWoA. If anyone has any advice on influencing
VWoA on this, I'd appreciate it...
