Subject: Hummer (syncro)


saw a privately owned Hummer in the grocery store parking lot 
yesterday....  they are so cool!

it was battleship grey with a full hardshell cab.  4 doors plus a 
swing open rear door.  windows, fold-up seats, gobs of ground 
clearance.  i have to say that it looked VERY well built with tight 
fitting, heavy duty doors.  also had trick aftermarket wheels and 
tinted glass.  it was sharp.  Oregon plates.

maybe THIS is a replacement for those of us with Syncro lust and $40K 
burning a hole in our banker's pockets.  get a high-top ambulance 
model, gut the interior and put some Westy stuff in there.  who here 
has ridden in one that can quench my burning desire for one?  they 
are really just a piece of crap, right?    :)

Westummer?  Humfalia?    Hmmmmm.........
