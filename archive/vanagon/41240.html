Subject:  Re: EV Oil Filter Removal - wrench

filter wrench...
i mean, you could tighten an oil filter with that wrench if you WANTED to...
not that you would, heh heh heh,
acctually, i did use it to tighten an oil filter, on my CRX, i could not
reach the filter to tighten it hand tight (this filter said to tighten
a whole turn after contact), so i used the filter wrench just to
turn it the full turn, it wasn't that tight, it was just awkward for my
non contortionist body to get to...

(i guess you vanapeople don't want to know how to convert a pnuematic impact
 wrench into an oil filter installer, eh?)

just kidding.
