  Vanagoners....


      The problem with my EV turned out to be the total collapse of the
distributor. Have any of you - EV'ers or Vanagoners ever had this problem
and at what mileage. I seems to have been pretty darn lucky to have had it
conk out in the take-out line at Wendy's rather than on the interstate with
a semi tailgating us.

     Anyhow, does this distributor loss impoly anything about our van and its
future?  BTW our mileage is 42.5k

       Thanks in advance...
