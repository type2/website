Subject: lighter plug.

Ed.

The PO added one below the dash, on the far left. Inboard enough so that
a rechargable flashlight(small) could fit in without the door hitting
it.  He also used a 12 volt outlet, rather than a cigarette lighter, not
that you could reach a cigarette lighter placed there, or anything else
placed there for that matter.

Cheers,

David

I have heard many of you talking about pluging things into the
cigarret lighter sockets in your buses.  I am either really blind or
I just dont have one in my '72.  Are they an aftermarket
only accessory?  if so, where would be the best place to install one
with out drilling any visible holes?
thanks for any advice.
Ed.
