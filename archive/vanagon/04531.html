no doubt the road salt is resp. for the lack of older cars in upstate NY
of any makke/model. But things in rust prevention are 10X better 
nowadays dont you think?

Im running 2 1983's (a Quantum and a diesel Vanagon) and both of the bodies
are just showing the first signs - can still drive the cars to a job
interview (and not park up the block- been there!)

I credit VW for half, and four applications of Nufinish per year for this
(waxing a Vanagon would be a great torture for kids - goes on and on .....)
