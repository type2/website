&gt;A friend of mine also has the 87 Wolfsburg van with power door locks and he
&gt;removed the driver side lock motor because something went wrong with it and
&gt;caused all of the other locks to continuously cycle up and down. Of course,
&gt;this was 1 hour before we were taking his van on a road trip.
&gt;
&gt;The replacement motor is around $115 and he is still in a holding pattern
&gt;hoping to be able to diagnose the motor problem and fix it.

I was going to respond to this message saying that the exact same thing
happened to me, until I realized Brian was talking about my Vanagon :)
