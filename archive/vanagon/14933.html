So Alistair Bell says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of weeks ago someone (Jack?) enquired about replacement screw
&gt; caps for the water tank and sink external drains. I said that I had
&gt; found an aftermarket drain tube that screws onto the sink drain plug - the
&gt; threads are just plain &quot;garden hose&quot; threads. The water tank drain plug is
&gt; a different matter. I've tried as many caps (from the lab) as I could
&gt; find, and the one that comes closest, but doesn't really work, is a cap
&gt; from a 50ml Falcon tube (mo-bi people know). I'll continue my search for a
&gt; cheap substitute.
&gt; 

Funny, I was sorta doing the same kind of search for the flue vent cover.
I've looked at all types of plastic bowls and tupperware.  I think VW (or
was it Delta Six?) really did their homework to come up with such a unique
sized cover so that nothing else will fit.  At least this recent RV place
deal is pretty reasonable.
