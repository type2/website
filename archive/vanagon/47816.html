&gt; Last night I dreamed I was pursuing a '69 red van in MINT condition -- it 
&gt; kept slipping away down alleys, the wrong way, and I couldn't get near 
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Then the owner painted the whole thing, windshield, windows and all, 
&gt; battleship grey to throw me off.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I have bus lust.  Is there something to do about it???
