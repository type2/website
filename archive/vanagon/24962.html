Subject: too many cylinders, was: Waving Vanagon drivers (again)

When I went to Allstate to insure the '62, our agent called up
VW, 1962 on the screen, and there was a little entry, &quot;Kombi&quot;
(I was thrilled), and the next, more particular screen, described
it as a &quot;6 cylinder.&quot;  Wow.  Those 1200 cc engine cylinders
were REALLY small.
