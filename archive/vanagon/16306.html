 William Kennedy asked why the heater flapper valve don't actually shut off
 the flow over the heat exchangers, but divert it outside instead. My guess
 is to prevent corrosion of the heat exchangers. By circulating air through
 the exchangers, whether or not the heat is on, condensation of water inside
 the exchangers will be reduced by the forced ventilation.
