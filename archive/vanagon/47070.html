Dennis,
  You said &quot;I change the neded pieces to use the 2.1 cooling system as it 
works better.&quot;  Could you expand on the cooling system differences just a 
little?  Apparently my experience with early water cooled gas and diesel 
VW motors is not typical of later generation versions.  What things did 
they do to improve them and how much of those improvements can be 
retrofitted to the earlier motors?  My first experiences were with what I 
think were 1.7 liter motors, so that's getting back there.
  Thanks,
  John Wakefield
