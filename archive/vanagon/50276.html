Subject: Rebuilt Engine 84 Westy

My 84 camper engine (water-cooled) has the following label on it:

   _______________________      
  |exchange               |
  |piece remise a neuf    |
  |025 100 031AX          |

  |Remanufacturing        |
  |Engine # 78897         |
  |_______________________|

Is there some way I can find out when/at what mileage it was rebuilt, so I know
how many miles I've got on my engine?
Any advice appreciated...
