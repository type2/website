Subject:      FS: Eurovan VW Camper(s) for sale (KC, MO)

i talked to Pete Sellers tonight and he said the dealer in Kansas City,
MO had two (2) VW Eurovan Campers which had been on their lot for over
a year. the sales people were trying HARD to unload them: list is over
$32,000 and the sale prices was given as $25,000 BEFORE negotiating even
started.  these are the VW version, not the Winnebago.

VERY low mileage, 94-95 model year.

call Cunningham VW, Kansas City, (816) 941-0555. the sales person mentioned
was Ed Fisher.
