Subject: Fwd: Looking for roof rack clamps

I have a roofrack originally installed on my old '67 split that I now use on
my Vanagon.  I measured the distance between the rain gutters on each side of
the roof at the places where the rack sits.  I put the rack on the garage
floor and marked the distance that I needed to stretch the rack legs.  I used
the torch to heat up each leg and pulled it out half the distance on each
side.  The split 1/2 length rack looks great sitting on the roof of my
Vanagon.

For any interested parties with Split Westy Pop-top...

	I have a Full length metal Roof rack with all 6 hold down clamps that
was modified by PO to fit over Pop-top ( he cut out the center section
of the rack so you have front and rear 1/3 roof storage areas)

	as this will not fit my '73 westy pop-top I am willing to let this go
for $150...or best reasonable offer

	I'm located in Nashua NH, on the MA/NH border

	This will also fit Bay window Hard-top Busses as well as as splittie
Hard-tops and sunroofs...
