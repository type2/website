Subject: Re: 911-Drivetrain in 66 Micro??

I know a mid 70 bus with this setup, in Puyallup, WA.  Plus I've seen a mid
60 double cab at the shows with a porsche-6 in it but am unsure on the
tranny.  It has 'porsche wagen' written accross the back.

&gt;I was thinking about putting a Porsche-6 and maybe trans in my Micro. I know
&gt;that it can be done in a vanagon, but I'm not sure if it would work in my
&gt;bus.  Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
