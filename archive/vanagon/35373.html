Subject: VW on PBS!


Howdy all,

        Mark J. just phoned me up (hey, almost past bedtime!!!) to tell me that
one of the local PBS stations is airing a show on the history of VW in the
U.S.  I set the VCR rolling (think I missed the first few minutes).
Anyway, the program is called &quot;Wheels.&quot;  Keep your eyes peeled for it!  I
had a quick peek at it... lots of great video footage from the '50s &amp; '60s.
:)

Nite-nite,
-Greg
