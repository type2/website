Subject: Re: Air-cooled to Water-cooled


I'm doing an air-cooled to AUDI 5 cyl. conversion. Not very difficult.
A garage will do that for about $ 2000.00 without engine.

As an add to the other previous mails, you have to drop the tank. A
heater will be nice inside. To change this I worked three days. I
just shot pictures about the cooling system and they will be added
to my web site at http://www.relitech_dot_com/helmut/index.htm soon.
