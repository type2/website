Subject: Re[2]: Back on heating

     A,
     
     &gt;I like the rad idea Lee, I guess it is stating the bleeding obvious 
     &gt;to say be carefull not to impede the flow.
     &gt;
     &gt;What about the &quot;oil-cooler inside the van with a fan&quot; idea. It would 
     &gt;be easier, but would it cool the engine too much?
     
     Good comments,
     
     I thought about it impedeing the flow, but figured it probabley 
     wouldn't if I used a radiator with a big flow area or big holes.
     
     I've heard of the oil-cooler idea before but it would have to be a 
     secondary oil-cooler, beacuse you still need the oil cooled in summer, 
     but don't want the heat -  but I guess you realize that.
     
     I suppose then if you fitted a second oil cooler you may need to 
     modifiy the oil pump because of the length of the pipes need to take 
     the hot oil up to the front of the bus. Then as you stated it most 
     likely cool the enging oil too much - these engine are supposed to run 
     hot.
     
     Which comes back to the water filled heater boxes being the &quot;safest&quot; 
     and simplest option.
     
     Lee.
