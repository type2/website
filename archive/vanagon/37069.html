Subject: power steering bleed/refill

Hi all,
        I have studied Bently concerning bleeding the power brake system,
but I'm not quite sure of the best outlet from which to collect old fluid. I
presume to try blocking the return inlet of the fluid reservoir and then
collecting the old fluid from the return line as it is pumped out by the
engine. Does this sound reasonable? I welcome anyone's thoughts and
suggestions. TIA.
