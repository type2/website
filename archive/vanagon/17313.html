Subject: Re: Vanagon with Porsche power.

Al Knoll reminds us that miscegenation (aircooled engine in watercooled body
or vice versa) means you get no heat.  I like the idea of a six-cylinder
Synchro, but I think aircooled upgrades to aircooled bodies, waterpumper
upgrades to waterpumper bodies, is a good rule of thumb.  In this connection
note that the Porsche engine, with good heater boxes, makes *great* heat.
Maybe bus and early Vgon people could use this in justifying the conversion
to skeptical spouses.

East Coasters: my 2.2l 911T engine, experienced in pulling a Vanagon, is
still for sale at $1500.  See it at the Zone 1 Porsche swap, May 20/21 in
Parsippany NJ.
