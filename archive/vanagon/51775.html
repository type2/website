&gt;these roads so I am now looking for the ultimate front end
&gt;protection - the ultimate bra.

here's all the bra info i have:

BRAS for Buses

Your Mama's Bra Company           74301.2203_at_Compuserve_dot_com
(206) 783-1779                    Custom Bras for 1950-67 Type IIs

VW Dealer                         custom bras for 1980-1991 Vanagons.
                                  Eurovans?  about $90.

Rocky Mountain Motorworks         1973-79 Buses - about $80
(800) 258-1996                    1969-72 Buses - about $80

West Coast Metric                 Covercraft bras for most years
(800) 247-3202                    except Eurovans.

&gt;round headlights.  I am also wondering if anyone knows of, or
&gt;has seen a brush guard for a vanagon, something suitable for
&gt;pushing those old land rovers out of the way ;-).

MSDS in california has one for $150. but i've seen it mounted on an 87
camper and it didn't look like much of a &quot;guard&quot;. :( and the bus owner
said he was a bit miffed that the shipping cost nearly as much as the
piece itself (!?). you might do better to have one fabricated locally.
