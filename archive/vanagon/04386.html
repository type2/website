&gt;I'd appreciate any leads.

you might try some local exhaust specialty shop that can make up pipes.
jim macklow said his father lived near some guy that did that. also you
might call the Borla folks (who advertise in the car magazines). when i
called them (about a year or so ago), the fellow i talked to owned a vanagon
and said they were thinking about starting up to make exhaust pipes and
mufflers for them (vanagons).  i haven't called back (bought a muffler some-
where else).
