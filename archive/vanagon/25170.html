Subject: air filter sizes
Date: Wed, 20 Sep 1995 11:20:40 -0600
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


The Wombat ('58) has a 1970 or so engine in it.  The air cleaner
that's on it now is a round paper type, with netting over (presumably
to keep the paper in place).  I have the original '58 air cleaner.
The question of the moment is, can I use the original air cleaner with
a '70 engine, or is it way too small?  It's certainly noticeably
smaller than the '66 oil-based air cleaner I've got in the Gerbil.

Assuming that I can use the original air cleaner, does it take the
same half quart that the later cleaners do?

The reason I'm asking all this is that the paper filter doesn't sit
real well on carb.  As a result, it interferes with the choke and does
not necessarily seal well (i.e., air might get in around the filter,
instead of through it).

Thanks!
