Subject: Re: Choosing a VW mechanic

Good story.

This points out a growing trend in all areas of consumption of professional
services.  As incompetence grows it is becoming increasingly important to
Interview potential service providors.  I make it a point to conduct several
&quot;interviews&quot; with anyone who will perform services for me: Realtor, furniture
refinisher, mechanic, etc.

I treat the interview for what it is.  A consideration for employment.  I
start with a background check.  I ask around for references (this list has
even helped me here).  I ask potential &quot;employee&quot; for their credentials.
 Then I ask very specific questions.  I even test them with questions I know
the answer to (where is the reset for the engine light on my Vanagon?)

This has worked very well for me so far, although as anyone in the hiring
business will attest, some people just slip through.

Good luck finding a mechanic.
