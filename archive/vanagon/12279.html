Subject: Busted ignition lock

I've got a key tumbler with a little (cheap pot metal) shaft that
broke off.  It won't engage the plastic electrical connector switch


I took the steering wheel off and removed the metal housing that
contains the lock tumbler assy and the electrical connector.
I'm having a hard time removing the old busted tumbler from the
metal housing.  There's a spring loaded 'keeper' in the new lock
tumbler.  I can't access the spring on the old tumbler to eject
it from the housing.  This is a major PITA.

Obviously the key lock assy is hard to access.  This is the major
security feature on the vehicle and retards theft.  Next time
I'll just install a toggle switch (ignition) and pushbutton
switch (starter) and use a Club.  grrrrrr
