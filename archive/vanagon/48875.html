Subject: we're touring the U.S. with our 83 Westy


Hiya folks,  

I really missed you all.  It's Ric Sherrod (formerly VdubDude_at_aol_dot_com) typin'
at ya.  We traded our computer off after we sold our house and we finally got
us a modem for our PowerMac so's we could newsgroup with the beloved vanlist
again.  It's been about two months now since we were online, and I,
personally, have been going through withdrawal from not having the vanlist.
 I have mostly completed restoration/ upgrading our '83  Westy for the
upcoming trip including; overhaul of the wasserboxer motor, installation of a
five-speed tranny with a special low final drive for towing our utility
trailer up mountains, a new windshield, new tires (low profile for lower
effective gear ratio), new ball joints, new front shocks, new rear air shocks
(to keep the vehicle level while towing), new shifter parts, new rear heater
and valve, new propane regulator, front and rear wheel bearings, new front
brake rotors and pads, new rear brake drums, specially fabricated towing
package including a trailer hitch receiver, replacing the driver's door and
repairing the sliding door and roller cover.
 Whew!!   It took a while to do all of that.

Well, we're on the road now and we're finally seeing the nation that we call
home.  We've never really been anywhere, and we felt as if we were really
missing something.  Why join the rat-race and work your youth away just so
you can have a vacation once a year and try to cram in seeing the country in
that time that you're supposed to spend relaxing?  Doesn't make sense to me.
 

So here we are on the road.  In Charlotte, right now.  We're visiting some
friends of ours that moved here from where we used to live in South Carolina.
 They have a small apartment and are nice enough to let us stay with them
until we get our computer together. :-)

We were in Atlanta last week and missed the opportunity to look up Joel
Walker because we were so busy getting everything together.  Sorry, Joel (if
you care).  I really want to say hey and look over your Vanagon.  Bob
Hufford, where do you live?  Steve, do you still own the V6anagon?   I
really want to see that one.  And Pat Eagan's really cool crew-cab is a must
see.  I'm dying to see them.  I just hope that my enthusiasm for special
Volkswagens doesn't make anyone think that I'm weird.

Anyway, I'm keeping a daily journal of our trip, if anyone is interested, and
I will publish it eventually if it's any good.  By the way, does anyone have
a fuel computer, a green 251 *** *** Digital Idle Stabilizer, or some really
nice gold velour seats &amp; door panels and curtains &amp; such for an '83 - '85
watercooled vanagon?  I could really use the fuel computer and the DIS right
away.  My computer doesn't seem to be listening to the temp sensor (which is
brand new), and our DIS was cutting out violently going up mountains so we
had to take it out.  Anyone have a good used bolt on turbo system laying
around?  (it couldn't hurt to ask)

Y'all write and tell us where you are and we'll try to get by and play some
cards &amp; maybe drink some beer or detail our vans or something!  See ya!
