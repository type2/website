I did this swap myself last year. Also into a 1985. You can use the exhaust
from the 2.1(if it has it).
You need to replace the 2.1 distributor  with the one from the 1.9 (no
wiring changes).
If you can get the coolant distributor(on passenger side in the 2.1). The
1985 van has the holes
already in the firewall so you can just bolt it in. Use the water hose setup
from the 2.1, it 
works much better than the 1.9 setup. I have heard that the combination of
the 1.9 computer 
system and the 2.1 injector system has some minor incompatabilities(the 2.1
injects more fuel per
cycle than the 1.9). This may cause a bit lower gas mileage, but I have not
noticed any.
I went from a 120,000 mile 1.9 to a 48,000 mile 2.1 and it is a world of
difference.
If you need any more info don't hesitate to ask.
