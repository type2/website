&gt;I yet another question, this one regarding 
&gt;the diesel coolant tank.
&gt; I have an '82.  The part # for the tank is 068-121-405B.  Does anyone 
&gt;know where one can be located?  The '83 has TWO part #'s, one is 
&gt;068-121-405D, Will this work in my van?

Hi Paul -
068-121-405D expansion tank is used in 83 to Early 84 Models (To VIN
25-E-070000) and is not compatabile for 81-82 diesels which uses the 405B
tank.  Since I do the E-Mail thing here at home I can't look at the shelf for
the moment to see the differences (I know I have both in stock), but I
vaguely remember talking to my buddy who is an authorized VOA Mechanic here
in Redding (There's no dealer between Sacramento and Medford) who informed me
that due to a lot of changes in the cooling systems on the 83, the 405D tank
has connections that are not compatabile with the 82's system.

None of the major importing warehouses carries neither one of these tanks
(not enough of 'em on the market to justify doing it, they say), so we
usually have to bite the bullet and import them in direct from Germany and
even then they cost serious bucks.  Alas, the markup is so s****y we have to
charge the same as the dealer (but at least ya don't have to wait a week or
so for the local dealer get one for ya).  We sell a decent amount of these to
justify carrying them, most to the Great White Northern neighbors (Canada),
because we keep hearing how blasted hard it is to find 'em.

V_at_L list members get 10% off the prices shown above and it's the best I can
do for now. :(
