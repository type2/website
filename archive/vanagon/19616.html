DON'T install it up front!  There is no reason to do this.  You want that
puppy as close to the engine as possible to avoid oil pressure problems and
minimize the chance of leaks.  You can mount it inside the engine
compartment and install a thermostat-controlled electric fan to force air
through it.  Best would be to route the heated air to the outside, but I
know a lot of people that don't.  Even better would be to route the heated
air into the interior as a source of heat!  Mounting it over the tranny is
a good choice as well - another listmember has done that with good results.
