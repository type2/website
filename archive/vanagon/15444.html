David S. David Kao (?), Sami Dahklia, myself and a few others have
installed oil pressure gauges. There
was lengthy discussion on this last fall. Generally speaking  a 50 dollar
vdo gauge with a dual sender (so you can keep your idiot light) seems to
be the way to go. Max pressure need not go beyond 90 psi. Trouble is the
dual sender is a bugger to install, necessitating some snippage of the tin
and a deft hand in threading the sender. While you are at it an oil
temp gauge is not a bad idea (though perhaps less crucial for a wasserboxer).
