&gt;Hi, geek here, speeking mechanical/corrosion engineer speek at you......
&gt;
&gt;I don't think the number of reports of coolant into the cyls. or comb. 
&gt;gasses into coolant is anywhere near as high as leaks past the thick rubber 
&gt;head gasket to the outside.  The cyl barrel is tightly clamped down by the 
&gt;head and a thin hard gasket.  This is a 'good' joint as far as resisting 
&gt;corrosion.  The long head bolts, the head and the block effectively make a 
&gt;vice that clamps the barrels under considerable load. Seepage is minimal, 
&gt;and the preloading is quite high, this prevents cyclic fatigue from cracking

&gt;the head bolts and is why proper assembly and retorqueing is good practice. 
&gt;Prevents thread fatigue.
&gt;
&gt;The aluminium water jacket is not clamped tightly however!!  The fat rubber 
&gt;gasket is there to allow different (ie. greater) expansion of the jacket 
&gt;when the engine heats up, the growth of alum. being near 4 times that of 
&gt;steel over the same length and temperature change. 
&gt;
&gt;When cold the jacket contracts, unloading the sealing force on the rubber 
&gt;gaskets.  Wasserboxer owners have reported spontaneous leaks with no prior 
&gt;history when temps. dropped to say -25F.  Old hardened gaskets simply can't 
&gt;expand enough to maintain tight sealing as the engine cools.
&gt;
&gt;The presence of thick soft gaskets in a system subject to a corrosive 
&gt;environment is a definate NO-GO in corrosion engineering.  It leads to a 
&gt;unique form of (high-speed) corrosion know as &quot;crevice corrosion&quot;  Small 
&gt;crevices are created by the pressure of the coolant in forcing itself UNDER 
&gt;the edges of the soft gasket, and being trapped in small pockets.  These 
&gt;trapped pockets exhibit accelerated corrosion due to variation in 
&gt;electrolyte ion concentrations within the pocket, thus the stagnant coolant 
&gt;sets up a miniature corrosion cell whose electrical driving force is due to 
&gt;the change in ion concentration, not to the presence of a second metal. Also

&gt;O2 gradients get set up, with the dissolved O2 near the metal surface being 
&gt;at a lower concentration than up by the rubber side. Yup we're talking 
&gt;microscopic action here.  The outcome is the pitting of the heads which is 
&gt;when all this corrosion becomes noticeable.
&gt;
&gt;The reason for our wasserboxers leaky head probs is that the engine was 
&gt;built as an aircooled engine with water jackets added. It was not built from

&gt;its inception to be a water cooled engine. The logic in the design is good 
&gt;from a mechanical engineering designers position, likely who VAG had doing 
&gt;the work, but they didn't consult with a corrosion engineer.  They obviously

&gt;have since the problems came up as the newest replacement heads are cadmium 
&gt;plated (gold-bronzish) which is a surface treatment that will SLOW the rate 
&gt;of corrosion.  Crevice corrosion mechanism will still exist.  Frequent 
&gt;changing of the coolant will put fresh corrosion inhibitors into the system,

&gt;slowing the process also.
&gt;
&gt;The bottom line here is that the corrosion is not due to dissimilar metals 
&gt;but to the geometry and components of the design.  Switching to a nickel or 
&gt;chrome plated aluminium cylinder barrel with the same coefficient of thermal

&gt;expansion as the water jackets may help by allowing the use of stiff 
&gt;uncompressible gaskets under high compression loads. But engine assembly, 
&gt;deck heights and head bolt torques would become more critical/fiddly.
&gt;
&gt;Another option was that a slip joint should have been designed, exactly like

&gt;the pushrod tubes in the pancake motors. Here the different thermal growth 
&gt;rates are accommodated by the end of the O-ringed tube sliding against the 
&gt;smooth bores in the block or head. Hey they don't leak do they?:) Same idea 
&gt;could be applied to the vanagons, but would've meant major head retooling 
&gt;and a wierd shaped &quot;O-ring&quot; to wrap around the outside of the jackets and 
&gt;slide withing a deep grove in the heads.  May not provide good enough seal 
&gt;to prevent seepage of 15psi water however.  So... Live with it is the 
&gt;solution, or go alternative engine. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So... you could get rid of the problem by 'aluminizing' the Cylinders on
&gt;&gt;the outside and using an aluminum gasket material??? or maybe just a
&gt;&gt;coat of paint would do it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Nope, wrong problem.

Sir Geek,  Dennis H here. Believe it or not, Leakage past the cylinders is
more of a problem than you think.  It is the cause of many unexplained
overheating problems.  Whenever there is trouble keeping the cooling system
bleed, this is the cause.  The combustion gasses pressurizing the cooling
system also cause many hose, radiator and heater core failures.  This is the
area that often requires head replacement to fix.  A good sealer will seal
off the channels on the flat part of the head.  Cooling system stop leak will
usually fix the small drips without dissasembly.
Dennis.
