Hey Mark,

The easiest way to test the A/C Refrigerant High Pressure Switch is to
unplug the connector and jumper across the connector terminals. This
should energize the Radiator Cooling Fan Relay, 2nd Stage (Position 5 on
the fuse block). The contacts in this relay send 12V from Fuse S1 to the
Radiator Cooling Fan Resistor, terminal #1. This will cause the Radiator
Cooling Fan to operate at its second speed.

It sounds like your Radiator Cooling Fan isn't coming on at all when you
turn on the A/C like it should. When you turn on the A/C, the A/C Relay
should energize and send 12V from terminal 5/6 to the Radiator Cooling
Fan Resistor, terminal #2, and cause the Radiator Cooling Fan to operate
at its lowest speed.   

If the Radiator Cooling Fan doesn't operate when the A/C is turned on,
the most likely cause is the Radiator Cooling Fan Resistor. It costs
between $35 &amp; $40 at a VW Dealer. Before you run out and buy one, make
sure that you are getting 12 volts on terminal 5/6 of the A/C relay when
the system is operating. That 12V also supplys one side of the A/C
Refrigerant High Pressure Switch.

Has the Vanagon been running hotter than it normally does? This problem
could also be caused by a bad Radiator Cooling Fan Resistor.

Good luck and happy hunting.
