&gt; i say late May 64, now i actually looked it up.

...and that coincides (kinda) with the &quot;0-5&quot; build date, at 
least the May part! Maybe it was &quot;20-5&quot; and I misread it.

This confirms the color data. I'm ready to believe its a '64!
Thirty five people have looked at it on the Web. Any other opinions?
