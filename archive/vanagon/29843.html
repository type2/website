OK Mario Sznaier gets definitely the Heidelberg IV manaul and the entire
set for being first caller unless some legit needy '86 owner speaks up
before tomorrow morn.  Mario however owns a '87 syncro 
and many others who &quot;collect&quot; them (should I keep this myself for my
collection?) wanted them.  Anyway to the rest of you who responded,
sorry to any '86ers out there you got dibs till tomorrow.
