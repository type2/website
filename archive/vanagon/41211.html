&gt;Any advice on rebuilding/replacing Vanagon automatics?  There may be a 
&gt;few in the local boneyards if mine is beyond repair.  What kind of costs 
&gt;can I expect??  Any input welcome.  Thanks.

I'm assuming that the differential section is ok and the tranny section has
bled to death.  I want you to know that the vanagon shared the same basic
automatic tranny with the Rabbit, Golf, Jetta, Later Bus, Audis 4000 (both
turbo and non-turbo) and Audis 5000 (both turbo and non-turbo.  The major
difference is the differentials that they tacked onto them to make them fit
the different cars.  The minor difference is the size of the clutches and
other controlling parts inside.  The lightest duty of the trannys is the
Rabbit.  The most bulletproof is out of the Audi 5000 turbo.  It is the
strongest longest lasting tranny available for all of these cars.  I would
suggest finding one in a junkyard and getting a guarrantee on it.  I would
not consider rebuilding one myself, and I am a VW Audi mechanic.  It's just
too much trouble to risk the kind of failure that can cost you bunches of
money and time.  My advice is to simply buy a known-good unit and swap it
yourself.  Just make sure that your differential hasn't crapped out on you
first.  You'll be reusing it if you cross-breed.
