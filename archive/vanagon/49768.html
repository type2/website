Subject: TIRES FOR '91 WESTY SYNCHRO

I'm the ecstatic new owner of a primo condition white '91 Westy Synchro with
47k miles.  It's my first synchro after having owned three Westies (two '72s
and one '84 Wolfsburg) and a '62 Bug. Will need to put new tires on it and
would appreciate suggestions for a good on and off-road tire that can get me
out of the Colo. rockies, down to southern Mexico (Oaxaca) and around steep
dirt roads, sometimes muddy.  Good gas mileage might be a consideration,
too. if that's a factor in tire selection.
