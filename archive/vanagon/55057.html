Subject: diesel coolant tank busted!!!!

HI VOLKS,,,

I have bonded with my 82 diesel vanagon....BUT the coolant tank (plastic tank
with the radiator cap has a leak!!!!)  I have patched it 2 times...not good 

I called the Volkswagen dealer today  ...They say its different tank from the 
gas Vannagons????  They want $92.95  plus shipping!!!!!!

The gas vanagon tank is only $42.....

CAN I GET THIS TANK ANYWHERE ELSE OR WILL ANY THING OTHER TANK FIT????

					Thanks AGAIN  Brian
