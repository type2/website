Subject: Re: Head Gasket help?

Ajax asks:
&gt; While having this replaced my mechanic advised me  that my head gaskets were
&gt; leaking slightly.  He suggests a complete repair...(.maybe $1500)!  Should I
&gt; wait untill the problem is major?  Are there any economical fixes?  I'll
&gt; probably get another quote but I'm bummed.  I've got 90,000 miles on the 87'
&gt; Vanagon Westy...

there will be as many opinions as owners... here's mine FWIW.

head gaskets can drip for years without undue alarm.  if you keep
the coolant levels up (CHECK THEM often) and don't experience
overheating or 'no heat' symptoms from the interior heater, i would
(and do) run with it until the problem worsens to the point where it
is unreliable.   THEN i would (and will) buy a VW factory rebuilt
engine instead of just fixing the heads alone.

one qualifier:  if you have a low mileage or newer vanagon, check out 
the VW arbitration and make them fix it!
