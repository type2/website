Subject: Another one with an anti-freeze leak.

Fellow Vanamaniacs (especially H2Oers),

Just noticed this morning a few drips of coolant on the bracing under the
engine of the '87 Syncro GL.  This was after a -10 night (-54 wind chill).
  We may be getting to -15 tonight.  Is the leak something to worry about or
just something to watch with the temperature drops?  It wasn't much of a
leak(hadn't done it before) and while the coolant level was at the minimum it
did come up to normal when the engine temp was up.

Just wanting to know.

Later, 
Brad
'72 Westy
