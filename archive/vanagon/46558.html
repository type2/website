Subject: Need Phone # for ARC (Gas Heater repair in NJ)

A friend needs the phone number for ARC (the gas heater specialist 
in northern NJ - I think his name is Arc Mervis, or something like 
that?)  I used to have the number, but now can't find it.  Can 
anyone help, or suggest other sources for parts for Eberspacher gas 
heaters?
