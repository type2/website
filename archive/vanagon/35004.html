&gt; &gt;Ok..Ok...I know this might be heresy...but I just took a look at a new
&gt; &gt;car (brand/model to remain secret for now...), and I'm considering
&gt; &gt;getting rid of the EV. Ok..ok..I might be a bit more level headed about
&gt; &gt;this in a day or so...but..strike while the iron's hot...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;NEVER abused...

&gt; hahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahaahhahahahaha ... oh yeah?? then why
&gt; the leather bra and panties and whip, eh?? what DO you do out there in the
&gt; garage, all alone with the poor defenseless EV??? EV? Evie??  hmmmmm ...
