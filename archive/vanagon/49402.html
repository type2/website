Subject: A/C compressor cutoff switch

Thanks to all who responded to the  A/C hp loss post.  Most of you just
reaffirmed that the A/C system in the Vanagons leaves alot to be desired.  A few
of you stated something about an A/C compressor override/cutoff switch designed
to temporarily shutoff the compressor during hard acceleration ( passing or
gaining speed after on ramps) or when there is a heavy load on the engine  (
hills, towing,etc. ) like the ones used on police cars.   

Where can you get those switches, and anybody had any experience with them?

Hmmm.... all this and I still don't know which van I'm going to keep!
