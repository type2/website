I've got one though it came from the passengers side, check because they may
be reversible. Its a sliding window complete.At 08:51 PM 10/24/96 -0500, you

&gt;I shut my driver's door on my 83 Westy today and the side window shattered

is 
&gt;I need a new side window.  It's the one behind the drivers seat.  If this was 

&gt;a regular Vanagon I could go to my junkyard and get one but it's one of those 

&gt;ones that slide and has the screen.  If someone has one to sell me, please 
let 
&gt;me know as I need it ASAP!

&gt;Hey, how hard is this to replace?  Anyone have instructions?
