Subject: varmit update

Well I had yet another experience with van varmits. This time I observed two
of them (mice) from the top bunk. They were pilfering large chunks of ramen
and escaping through the front of the van, up under the dash. I think I've
figured out two places where they may be gaining entry:

1. Through the fresh air intake behind the front grille. There is a plastic
screen covering the intake, but there's enough space there for a mouse to
squeeze through.

2. Through the hole where the wiper washer fluid tube enters the van.
There's a rubber grommet here, but mine has deteriorated leaving a nice 1&quot; hole.

I'm in the process of sealing the fresh air intake with wire mesh and
replacing the rubber grommet on the washer tube. I'll let the list know if
this does the trick.
