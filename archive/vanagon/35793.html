&gt; Rusty VanBondo feels like he has been going through the middle aged crazies
&gt; since about age 28. It was age 28 when I finally &quot;grew up.&quot; I think the
&gt; later fourties and fifties are going to be more docile. Either that or I
&gt; will just percieve them that way.  Kinda like a psychadelic Ronny Reagan

&gt; BTW: (content = vw)

I try not to worry about the middle-aged crap too much, at least until I
reach &quot;Mental Pause&quot; at which point I will take a moment and think about
it...

I'll just roll up the windows in the EV (no I don't have power windows!),
nurse another Dr. Pepper, crank up my old King Crimson tapes, and stake a
claim to my favorite lane on the I-5 in rush hour traffic on my way to
work! (Actually saw TWO other EVs today!  That's more than I've seen in the
last month! In LA, for Rice Cake!).
