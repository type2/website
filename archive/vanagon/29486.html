Subject: Type Two? 2? or what?

&gt;Subject: Type Two? 2? or what?

&gt;Within type 2's (Transporters 1950 - 1995) there were four generations:
&gt;T1 1950 - 67
&gt;T2 1967 - 79
&gt;T3 1979 - 90 (&quot;syncro&quot; - 92?)
&gt;T4 1990 -
&gt;Simple eh?&quot;
&gt;Well I thought it was till I got this! So am I a type 2/type 1 with my Split?
&gt;Oh well it's all type 2 to me .....love and peace...Dave and Cee and SSVC

No, actually, you end up a Type 2/T1, or maybe a Type II/T1.
Or is that a TII/T1?  If you retrofit fuel injection you
become a TII/T1/FI.  If you add enough Italian parts, you
could be a GT/TII/T1/FI.  And, if you update your engine,
you could be a 1600 GT/TII/T1/FI, or a BMW, whichever comes
first.
