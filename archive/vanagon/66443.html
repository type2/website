Subject:      Water for anti-freeze!

   I was in Kmart, tonight and in the automotive section
   they were selling Water! Yes,, prestone had 99.9%
   pure water for sale, to use in your cooling system. Now I wander
   why??????    Forget the expensive phosfate free anti-frezee
   stuff. It's the water!
