Subject: Re: Anyone need '53? parts

ah HA! So you admit that you don't read the weakly stats! Because if you did, 
you'd see that the oldest bus on the list is a '56.

Very interesting, though, if it really is as old as '53. These things are about 
as rare as a Mazda MPV owner on a Vanagon list. Too bad all the dash stuff is 
gone...I'm assuming bumpers, too. All that stuff is worth $$$ now. Cool find, 
John!

&gt; The local bug guy just took in an ancient bus, I'm guessing
&gt; a '53, it is/was a panel (now has a big round window in the
&gt; side) nothing inside it, barndoor hatch gone, engine long
&gt; gone, GAS TANK AND CAP still hanging there in the engine
&gt; compartment and look quite OK for their age, nothing inside
&gt; the rear of the bus, front seat frames present, 3-spoke banjo
&gt; style steering wheel present (black) and in OK condition,
&gt; gauge panel gone, most knobs gone from that funny early style
&gt; dash, steering box and column still attached to that old
&gt; wheel, front axle present, all 4 16&quot; wheels present, there
&gt; is a tranny hanging in it, as to it's origionality who knows?
&gt; Whole thing is mucho rough and probably not near rebuildable
&gt; at any cost, I didn't check to see if any lights/signals were
&gt; present, didn't think about it, if anyone has any needs, mail
&gt; me with specifics and I'll go check it out.
