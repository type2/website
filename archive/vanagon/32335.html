Subject: replacing strut assembly

Well I had to crank up the Jack, the '77 westy this frosty morn to get to work
because my daily driver, a '71 super beetle, was making a racket up front. 
Looks like I'll need to replace the struts which looks easy enough on paper,
Haynes manual. The local bug/bus man wants &quot;just under $100&quot; for the job and
suggests not doing it myself for fear of having the coil spring knock the
breath outta me. Is this a legitamate concern or should I go rent a compressor
from the rental store and try it so as to save a few clams? I searched the
archives but didn't find anything so I'd appreciate any suggestions from the
collective volks out there. I am grateful to have such an excellant resource
at the touch of a button! This is a great list to be a part of...
