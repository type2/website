I'm looking for a oil temperature sensor and gauge.  I've been 
told the type that replaces the dipstick is better than the one that 
senses at the sump.  Any comments? I've been told the opposite also.
Has anybody run BOTH and compared the readings, and how does one
tell which is more accurate, without a 3rd temperature reading IN the 
oil without touching the metal case thus changing the temp reading?

I've been told the VDO part numbers are:
310-012 gauge
323-081 sender to replace the dipstick

Just in case this has been covered in the gopher archives, 
my (at work) server won't let me get there!
