So jackr_at_starfleet.scs.ag_dot_gov says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rounded?  Tall?  Short nose?  Sounds like Stimpy!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -David
&gt; 
&gt; Uh uh.  Sounds more like like a whale to me.  A &quot;Willy-wagon&quot; maybe? &quot;Jawsagon&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; 

Davids email address (starfleet) made me think of Star Trek, which made me 
think of a &quot;shuttle craft&quot; and thats what a Eurovan looks like to me.
