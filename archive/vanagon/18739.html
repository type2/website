&gt; 6 months or so.  I need a set of spark plug wires that are good
&gt; performers, stand the heat, priced decently (unlike those $100 or so
&gt; sets), and are readily avaiable (no need to special order).  Thanks
&gt; for the help.

I have always had the best luck with the Bosch wire sets. And they
come with a lifetime guarantee.
