Subject: motor swapping


Hey Lee, thanks for the info:

&gt;Well now, you could go two ways here. Either stick in a big-bore (1835cc) Type I
&gt;motor with dual-port heads, twin carbs, a mild cam, a larger oil pump, a 
&gt;external supplement oil cooler, a lightened flywheel, and a CrMoly balanced 
&gt;crank. That's give you about 100bhp...

Do you mean that the mounts for an 1835 are essentially the same as my 1600?  I've
been slowly renewing my bus and have until now ignored the engine aside from an
occasional touch of oil :) and periodic tuneups.

I have no experience with buying used/rebuilt engines without a car attached,
and would love to hear juicy details about how much that might cost and if anyone
has had good or bad results from particular suppliers in Mass or New Hamster.
