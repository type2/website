Subject: Re: Weddle Engineering, Locking Differentials Update and Parts Plea

Perhaps a bit overdue, but thought I should give an update 
on Weddle Engineering.  I removed my transmission back in 
August (16th) for some warrenty work by German Transaxle and 
the installation of a Weddle Locker.  Within 24 hours German 
Transaxle had the unit repaired, the Weddle Locker installed, 
and the assembly ready to ship.  Then they received a call 
from John Weddle regarding a bad batch of gears.  As luck 
would have it - I ended up with the bad gears.  The good news 
is that it wasn't shipped to Fairbanks and installed in my 
vehicle.  The bad news is that my transaxle is still in Bend, 
Oregon waiting for a Weddle Locker.

The latest news from Weddle Engineering is that it will be at 
least 30 days before they can supply a locker.  In my case 
that was the main reason I elected to send the transmission 
out, as the warrenty problem - slipping out of first gear on 
hard deceleration was something I could live with.  I made sure 
that German Transaxle had the Locker in stock before I sent out
my transaxle - but sometimes things go wrong.

I have nothing but praise for both companies.  German Transaxle 
offered to modify my transmission for the same price as the 
Weddle Locker and install a VW syncro locker.  I have decided 
against this as my wife is the primary driver and is not excited
about needing to slow to 5 miles per hour to engage the locking
differential.  Additionally, I would need to secure, purchase, 
and install the vacuum control system.

My plea is simple - if anyone has an older Weddle locker that is
not currently being used, I could sure use one to get my vehicle
back on the road.  the Van is jacked up outside (as my garage is
not tall enough to allow the transmission replacement.  Last night
we had our first snow.  The way the weather goes, in 30 days, I'll
be installing the transmission in a blizzard.

Thanks,
Fred
