Subject: The $900. '92 VW Bus (lucky/tall tale?)

Ok.Ok.... The one I've been telling lately (w/o questioning its authenticity)
goes like this....
	I was just a wanna bus last year looking to replace the '74 westy non-
pop-up I had sold my dad sans engine.  I was checking out a '74 camper (non-
westy) pop up in N.H.  It looked good but I was partial to the westfalia setup.
Anyway, the guy shows me around - He's got a 23 window deluxe he's restoring.
A few out back for parts.  3 or 4 bay windows, and then he leads me into the 
garage where there's this &quot;bug&quot; covered up under canvas.  He peels back the 
canvas and here's this Hebmuller (sorry, about the spelling) and not really
knowing much about these then I don't remember the year.  It was either the
first year or 2nd that that guy in N.Y. was importing them from Germany in the 
early 50's.  It's mint.  Fully gone over.  The story goes- His buddy was in 
Boston at Mass General recovering from an operation of some sort.  Looking over
the classified ads in the Boston Globe he spies a VW Beetle (195?) for sale 
for $500.  Sends another buddy to check it out.  The lady's filin' for divorce,
soon to be divorced hubby's out of town, wants $500 for the &quot;bug&quot; by the 
weekend......etc..
