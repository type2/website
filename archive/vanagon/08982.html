&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know a good place to get a new skylight? This one is cracked.
&gt; I tried WCM but no luck. They recommended Bus Boys (never heard of them)
&gt; but they're closed until Jan 2. I'm hoping to avoid the dealer :(
&gt; 

May I first suggest that if you have future questions, that you be sure
to read the FAQ's for vanagons.  Sources for this are:

      ftp site
        lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:/pub/vanagon
      gopher site
        halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:/Miscellaneous/Vanagon
      URL: gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

This will answer many of your questions.  Don't worry, you can still pester
the list.  I always do.  ;)

Regarding companies that have Vanagon supplies try:


        Euro-American RV Products (you may know them as Delta-Six Industries- 
        but this is the retail wing). 

        Phone: (818) 760-4214 
        FAX is (818) 760-4216

            Who also bought a skylight from them for around $30.00???


        Vantastics
        A Division of Liggett Enterprises
        829 Norwalk Street
        Greensboro, NC 27407

        In NC Call 1-800-VANAGON
        or 1-910-547-0144
