If there was a trend at work wrt stats it might be this:

a) we represent a fairly even distribution of vandom in the real world
(sample size is accurate);

b) the Vanagon sample  is biased toward because of our special concern,
knowldege and expertise;

c) there is a bias towards early year models for reason b) above.

In any event assuming we are a representative sample there are a lot of
possibilities:

a) those years which constitute a culmination in technological
development (VW got the bugs out) should be overrrepresented in the
sample: namely the final production years of the four variations a) 67?; b)
79; c) 82: d) 90 and e) 9?. Not supported.

b) those years in which the model was priced competitively against the
competition should be overrepresented; partially supported for the 70's
and Eurovan (reverse the two);

c) those years in which the colour scheme appealed to buyers;
partially supported for the late 80's?.

d) those years in which the quality of metal and other components was
least prone to breakdown; partially supported for the 1980's;

e) those years in which there fewest catastrophic events leading to
inadvertent collisions etc on the highway; supported for CA only;

f)  insert outrageous proposition here......:)
