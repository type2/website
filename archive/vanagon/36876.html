I was wondering.....why drop a '78 in there.  If you use an '80 thru '83 you
would have all the sheet metal to seal it properly.  Secondly, sealing the
top of the engine (cool side) from the bottom (hot side) is critical to all
air cooled VWs.  What was this guy (mechanic) thinking?  Lastly, what are you
doing for heat?  Does the '84 have a gas aux heater or did you do some
creative plumbing?
