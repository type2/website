&gt; Dave Black reports:

 It appears that the crank no longer turns the cam.  Broken cam gear?
&gt; Broken cam?  I don't know.  Maybe I don't even want to know.  For the
&gt; right price, I could easily be persuaded to join the ranks of the 
&gt; bus wanna-be's!
&gt; 
  Could this be a result of a line bore done off center creating an incorrect
  &lt;like overtight&gt; mesh between the timing gears?

  Another possibility: I've been reading &quot;How to Rebuild your Air-cooled VW
  Engine&quot; since my engine is in pieces in the garage and there is some 
  discussion of potential parts mis-matches between cams &lt; 3 rivet and 
  4 rivet&gt;, oil pumps &lt;different gear widths&gt; and cases &lt;different sizes of
  oil galleries and studs  Would you like me to xerox that section
  send it to you so you can check it against the parts that you have &lt;had?&gt;?

  Sorry to hear the bad news - don't sell your bus, IMHO, get a different 
  motor or a new case and use with the remaining good parts you have.

  Dave
