Kelly,

You were kind enough to respond several weeks ago when I had questions
about my Dometic, which now is working!  I did take mine out per the
instructions in the Bentley manual.  The removal process was not that hard.
 The only part that was not clear is that you must disconnect the entire
vent to the outside (from the outside) and then gently pull the beast out. 
Once mine was out, it was relatively easy to open up the combustion chamber
and verify that the 'sparker' was working.  In doing the checkout, I
realized that it would be very easy for bugs to get into the works, which
is why I have an 'outside flue cover' on order, but it really is a simple
beast.  Good luck.
