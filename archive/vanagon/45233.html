Subject: Re: Martha's roof coating (Kool Seal price/availability)

I have about five gallons of Kool Seal waiting to be applied to the tin 
roof of our soon-to-be &quot;country estate&quot; (a.k.a &quot;The Dump&quot;).  Looks like I 
will be saving a half-gallon for the Westy.  It's good stuff:  expands 
and contracts without cracking and is a lovely shade of plain ol' white.

BTW, Kool Seal goes for about 14 dollars a gallon at your local building 
supplies store (in my case, Lowes).
