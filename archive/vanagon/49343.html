Subject: Help, 85 shifting problems

My wife was coming home from a long trip, when she started to have problems
getting the van into gear.  I found that with the clutch pedal to the floor
it would grind into reverse.  With the clutch pedal to the floor you could
shift into 1st-4th, but it would grap within the first inch of pedal
movement.  The fellow who works on my van has looked at this problem before
and said the &quot;shift guides&quot; are worn.  The problem went away, but now is
back.  Any help would be appreciated. Van has 140K on it.

Sincerely,

Bill Lund
