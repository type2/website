Subject: Spare Fuel tank advice needed

Hey volks,
I used to have a vehicle with a second fuel tank.  It was great to have the
extended range for trips.  My 85 Westy only holds enough for about 250-275
miles.  Can anyone offer advice on installing a secondary tank?  Supplies
(junkyard, new....), location to mount, etc...

I'll be doing the work myself and cost is a factor.  Anyone had experience
installing an auxillary tank?
