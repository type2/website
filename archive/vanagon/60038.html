In my experience of making windows seals for 20 years, I have found that
in the beetles that the plastic variety trim  is much thickerand is &quot;T&quot;
shaped to allow it to stay in the groove better.  Depending on the
&quot;window flange&quot; area and depth this can make the rubber force itself to
the body in a more positive way which has lead me to believe that it
offers better sealing qualities at the base of the rubber lip to the
body.  Some Buses I've seen with the trim removed have shown the seal
base to shrink slightly, which gives me pause to wonder if the Windshield
leaks in the rain.  Vanagon rubber is shaped different (in the
cross-section/profile) than their earlier cousins, a little &quot;beefier&quot; so
this may not present a problem.

I know my 62 Bug seals leaked like a seive when I did that.  Had to put
&quot;Cal&quot; Rubber all around

I did take the one out of my Vanagon Windshield, but had no ill effects
for about two years.  Then somebody decided to punch a hole in the glass
and I replaced it with a &quot;Cal&quot; Type Seal (OE-German).

I know personally that WCM does not yet make the window seals, that
they're brought in from Germany or if they're in a bind, they buy them
from the local Dealership (so do we, I'll admit it).  But I'm working on
having them made on dies I'm having constructed right now here in the
good ole USA - hope to have them ready by the end of summer at prices
that are not so stratospheric.  Does  around $49.95 for a &quot;Cal&quot;
Windshield Seal sound good as opposed to the Dealer's/WCM's price?

I know WCM and RMMW have shown some serious interest towards my way on
these, so let's see what happens.
