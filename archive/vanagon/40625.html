So Barry Grimes says:

----- description of heater hose fix deleted-------

&gt; You can help me convince VW of this defect. If, upon inspection, you find
&gt; that your hoses have been incorrectly joined,  please notify me as I am
&gt; coordinating an effort to inform VW- and attempt to recover my loss.

It's helpful information like this that should be rewarded.  I think you
EV owners owe this gentleman a huge debt of gratitude for giving you
this information.  Not only should you use it to your benefit, but I
think a monetary thanks is in order or a some equivelant.....

I know other folks on the list have helped me tremendously and I'll
do what I can to repay them.  Some expect nothing, but I don't think
that's always fair and try to do them, at least, a favor when they
need one.

Good luck to you EV folks!!

Cheers!
