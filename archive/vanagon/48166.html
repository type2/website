Two things I dont like about the 79 Bus is 1: The catalytic conv. is 
right next to the left cylinder head(that is if yours has one-All 
Califonia &amp; some Federal)which tends to make the head run hotter.Bad idea!
2: The 79 is the first year with square port exhaust in the heads.They 
are much more expensive! -Mike
