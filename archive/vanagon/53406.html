84 GL with factory sunroof: what regular maintenance is needed for the
sunroof? Greasing, if so which bits?
Do the 'drains' need cleaning out? If so where are they and what should you
do to them? I thought it would be better to use the damp weather for this
rather than waiting until everything's dried out and baked hard in summer.
