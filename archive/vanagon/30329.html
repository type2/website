Well,
I did my part (Gerry, please don't jettison me for this :-)
I wore the (in)Famous Vanagon list T-shirt while strolling the theme
parks in Florida (It does attract quite a bit of attention, I
noticed, alas, no - what was it? - HOT VW bikini babes :-( )

 &gt; To All:
 &gt; 
 &gt; Whereas, all Type II owners are known to be brave, loyal, trusting and true,
 &gt; as well as intelligent, kindly and thoughtful, it seems a mite odd that the
 &gt; list remains so small.  And while we are but a small and happy band, there is
 &gt; strength in numbers.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I suggest that when any of us attend any gathering of Volkswagen owners that
 &gt; we carry with us and display in some prominent place, a placard or sign
 &gt; telling of the existance of the Vanagon list with easy instructions on how to
 &gt; join, how to buy a computer, how to rebuild the 3/4 clutch hub of a late
 &gt; model tranny, and other useful tidbits other Type II owners have been lusting
 &gt; for.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Submitted for your consideration.
