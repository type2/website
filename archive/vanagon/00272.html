Subject: List down

Please accept my apologies for the list being unavailable during the day 
today.  I don't know what kinds of messages you got from the list, but I 
hope it wasn't too distressing.  There was a power outage last night 
(planned) which I had forgotten about.  In addition, the startup of the 
list is not automated with the startup of the machine.  I will make sure 
that is so from now on.  So I just finally realized the list wasn't 
running when I logged on this afternoon to find NO messages in my vanagon 
inbox.  I was dismayed by the lack of discussion and then horrified to 
realize it was MY fault.  I'll try to keep this to a minimum.
