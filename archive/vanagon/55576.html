Subject: RE: Yes another stupid question:) 

It's easy.

You'll find a plug at the bottom of the case.  Open it and the transmission fluid will drain 
out.  Clean the plug.  Put the plug back in.

You'll find a simular plug half way up the side of the case, about half way between the 
front of the transmission and the axle. Open it.  Fill the transmission with hypoid gear 
oil, see owner's manual for specifications or go to your local auto parts store and ask them 
what you should use.  Fill transmission until the fluid starts flowing out the hole.  Clean 
the plug and put it back in.

The biggest challenge will be - how to put the transmission fluid into the fill hole?  I use 
a large funnel and a plastic hose.  Place the funnel in the front of the engine compartment. 
 Stick the hose in the end of the funnel and run the other end over and down to the fill 
hole on the transmission.  Poor the fluid in slowly.  Its easier to do during warm weather.

Cover the ground with something, you WILL spill.  I use cardboard from an old box.

That's it!
