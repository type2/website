Subject: Re: O2 Sensor rust!

&gt;   	Anyway, my new problem is that I cannot get the O2 sensor out of my 
&gt; cat. conv. it has rusted into place.  I went by Midas and they could not 
&gt; get it out.  They said that they could heat it up, but that it would melt 
&gt; the threads and I would have to get a new cat., which would be $300 or 
&gt; something.  I have sprayed the bee-jesus out of it with Liquid Wrench but 
&gt; it still will not move. 

Here is a thought.  I've had some trouble w/ the replacement cat I 
put on my BMW.  The O2 sensor was riding way too close to the 
driveshaft.  The muffler shop that I use offered to weld that hole 
closed and put a new hold in w/ a nut that fit the sensor.  Perhaps 
your local muffler shop can just cut a new hole and weld in a nut to 
hold the new sensor which  of course will be coated heavily w/ 
anti-seize.
