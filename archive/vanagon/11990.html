Subject: UK Bug Freeze - update

     Hi all,
     
     I just thought I'd tell you what I did at Bug Freeze last Sunday.
     
     Well, I managed to sell 3 sets of Split bus US spec. rear towel rail 
     tubes which paid for the stuff I bought there. 
     
     I found a guy selling some interor panels, they were in pretty poor 
     shape (he thought) but after I pulled off the vinyl pieces, scrubbed 
     them with some Flash bath cleaner and stuck them onto new hardboard, I 
     had a new set of interior panels for my bus - cool, they have that 
     straight look about them now, not all warped and saggy.
     
     I got a roll of black carpet from that Middletons place for 5 quid. 
     I'm gonne edge the carpet with green vinyl strip, and it'll go well 
     with the interior theme.
     
     I got an extra cool, 21-window, in green and white, key fob for 1.50
     
     This was my first major VW event that I took the Samba too and it 
     cruzed really well down the M6 at 60mph! The sun was out and the skies 
     were blue. I even took my coat off about 30 miles into the trip, so it 
     must have been warm.
     
     Danny, (my mate), got a Splittie door top to match his other door top 
     which are to be sent off to the Chromers. He also got some NOS, vent 
     wing latches, door window latches and popout catches.
     
     Next meeting for me is the VW Enthusiasts meeting near Coventry on 
     March 5th.
     
     cya,
     
     Lee.
     
     '64 Samba.
