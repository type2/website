Subject: Re: Cold Start


	Jack's point about connecting negative cables last is valid and
worth consideration. I've never seen or heard of a hydrogen exposion
associated with a jump-start, but it is a possibility. In which case
the order he suggests, and locations, make the most sense. Positive terminals
connected first, then the negative of the recipiant car, finally the negative
cable to the BODY, AWAY FROM THE BATTERY of the donor car. This keeps any 
sparks well away from either battery. I'll try it this way next time.

	I'm going to politely disagree with him on when to start the donor
vehicle- Since we both assume the donor is warmed up, I assume the
donor battery is fully charged (13-14V indicated) and a typical VW
battery is going to have 250 CCA MINIMUM. My recollection of my brother's
diesel is that the &quot;heavy duty&quot; alternator is 65 A, and its probably going
to putting out a steady 14V. 
	So the spark on connecton is either at 13 to 14 V, with 250+ A or
more behind it, or at a solid 14 V, with 315+ A. I can't say I've noticed
a difference in sparks upon connection, but I have had cold-morning problems
starting the donor car, and so I don't fool around with it anymore.
	My own paranoia, perhaps.

	Has anyone here had damage to their computer control box(s) from
a jump start or other obvious cause?

	Cheers!
	Bill
