Subject: Re: New Heads/Coolant Pressure

I'm sure you had something else in mind [or expected a more
technical answer] but, basically a somewhat
pressurized system with cracks pressure is lost first from the 
crack requiring the least work , once that is patched it
will take slightly more pressure to push coolant out the
next easiest place. 
  if you have a cracked radiator [say near the top] it wont leak there
until there's enough pressure to keep the radiator mostly filled.
  by the way, if the heads are not pitted, so all you need isnew
gaskets you might come out for under 1000$.
