Subject: Vanagon 86-91 o2 sensor

I have seen a lot of messages posted concerning failed o2 sensors, as I 
am getting ready to get a Vanagon, (a move from 71 Type II) I am 
wondering if the o2 sensors on Vanagons are more problematic than for 
instance on Chev/Fords. As a rule, all o2 sensors burn up, but 
approximately how long does this veedub one last. I also saw someone 
mention that a generic or unbranded (USA?) one can be releatively easily 
made to work on the Vanagon. Any feedback appreciated.
