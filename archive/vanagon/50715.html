 I have now owned this 86 GL for 10 months, including a fair amount of
maintenance
 (head replacement etc.) but a problem which someone may have experienced
before now 
 needs to be addressed.  When I fill the gas tank, I am getting major
spillage coming out
 of what seems to be an overflow somewhere.  I have had it into the local
dealer; their
 comment was that they would have to drop the gas tank to investigate
(apparently a 4 hour
 task at $55 per hour) and only then would they be able to determine the
cause.
 
 This seems to be quite a bit of money just to determine a problem - has
anyone experienced
 this before - any suggestions would be much appreciated !
 
 Thanks in advance

One of the plastic hose connections at the top of the tank has cracked or
there is a hole at the top of the tank.  Have VW oreder the hose kit.  The
microfilm shows it.  The tank should be drained before removing.  4 hours
seems long as the tank is held in by 2 straps, but with changing the hoses
and stuff, is probably realistic.
