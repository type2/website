Subject:      campmore Eureka tent



Still think I would prefer a side attachment to a rearend hookup (for those of
us to far from the Baja to get good adobe tents). I have looked at that style
of Eureka tent to fashion one that would attach to the side, since it does not
have poles in the way like some other popular styles.
