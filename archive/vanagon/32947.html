Subject: What do ya think? Eurovan Problem Tracking Database

  Owning a EV, I know they follow in the Vanagons footsteps for being 
EXTREMELY expensive to repair and service.

  I was thinking that if you fellow EVers would be inerested in sending all 
the stats about your Eurovans, VIN, Costs, Repairs (mileage at occurance), 
everything but gas and oil.

  I would be willing to set up a database to track all the problems we
have and identify trends such as piston slap, coolant leaks, anything that
we could argue to VWoA as a design flaw or shoddy workmanship. 

  I have very little time to do this so I couldn't promise instant 
implementation and maintenance of the data.  But, I really think the data 
could save us all money in the long run.
