Subject:       Snow... :( (non-vw)

Sorry folks,

Just had to vent a little... It's now been over a month that we've 
had SNOW on the ground here, even though it hasn't snowed since Dec 
29 or so. Now they're calling for more, and we had a dusting this 
morning. This is NOT normal!

Since I don't have either a Syncro or a Propex, I am desparate for 
spring to come...

arg.
