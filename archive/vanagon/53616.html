If you've only been on the list a short time, then you got a welcome message
which you were supposed to read and keep.  I've half a mind to remove everyone
who claims they've only been on t

thanks  ive got ?s on the different
&gt; years and pluses and minuses between when looking at the diff ones. at
&gt; this time i have a 86 gl 2100cc digifant set up and ive played with this
&gt; and know what it has.but i would like to find out about the 80-83
&gt; aircooled ones with the 2.0 liter . is it hyd and what kind of carb or fi
&gt; set up does it have?  or is it best for me to look at type 4s up to 79
&gt; from 73. i know the 72 stuff and dont want one. my favorite is the 68-71
&gt; upright motor carbed motors that ive known loved and built for many years.
&gt; problem is i live in michigan  and do not wish to subject a bus of that
&gt; age to the elements. or am i just being a geek? the 67 and earlier are out
&gt; of the ? for winter due to top end speeds and my personnal reasons. i
&gt; already own a 56 sinlgle cab and love it to death and it would break my
&gt; heart to see it rust away on the salt covered roads. 
&gt; the freeways also have been bumped up to 70 and top speed on the early
&gt; ones is only 58mph at 4100rpm stocker 1600cc. 
&gt; sorry for my rambling its new years day and im bored already. and every
&gt; thing is closed 
&gt; Later Jonce
&gt; 56 single cab
&gt; 66 sunroof bug 
&gt; 66 squareback
&gt; 86 vanagon
