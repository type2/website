Win some lose some.

Those cool panels I mad for my bus, with the hip blue plaid covering,
are all shot to hell after 2 days of rain.  Seems they weren't waterproof
after all.  They've buckled up like you wouldn't believe; Slavador Dali
would love my interior!

Well, looks like I'll be gettin' the repro panels sometime in the future...
