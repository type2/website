Subject: Re: brake fl leak

&gt;I have what is now a big leak between the two brake fluid reseviors(?) on 
&gt;my 71 westy.  It is coming from the connection between the upper res (in 
&gt;the bus) and the one on top of the master cylinder, it seems the little 
&gt;rubber gasket gave up. I have looked around but have had luck in locating 
&gt;one. Does anyone know if they are available or an alternative solution.  
&gt;Thanks.

The rubber seals that fit on either end of the tube that connects the brake
fluid resevoirs on the 71 is no longer available from the dealer and I
haven't found an aftermarket source.  I bought a set of NOS from VW Bus
Heaven in Kingston, Massachusetts 3 months ago for around $3-$4.  I believe
their toll free # is 1-800-VWTYPE2.  It would be a good idea to replace
these seals (especially if the upper seal is leaking) as soon as possible
since brake fluid eats paint and putting it off will increase your work
later. Not to mention the fact that brake fluid can be useful...

While on this subject, I thought I'd mention for all you 68-72 bus people
out there:  The plastic resevoir that sits on the master cylinder is no
longer available from the dealer (but the master cylinder is, go figure) and
no aftermarket parts source that I'm aware of makes one.  The only
alternative you have if you break/puncture yours on removal (really easy to
do on a 20 year old piece of brittle plastic) is to find a used one if you
are replacing your master cylinder with a stock one.  The rubber grommets
that fit on the top of the master cyl are still available.   So be really
careful when you are removing that old resevoir.

If you do break it though, all is not lost.  I believe the 71-72 bussers can
use the 73-79 master cylinder but you will need the plastic resevoir for it
(there is a wider spacing between the inlet holes on the top of the master
cylinder).  This is still available from the dealer (for ~$25 from the
dealer and from RMMW).  Also, you'll probably have to coax your metal brake
lines to a new orientation to line up with the new master cylinder.  I'm not
sure if this solution will work for the people with 68-70 nonpower type
master cylinder.  The nonpower mast cyl. shares the same resevoir with the
71-72 people, though.

I guess the bottom line is, if you plan ahead for your next master cylinder
replacement you can save some $ by finding a used resevoir off a junk bus
and keeping it if yours breaks. 


Good luck!
