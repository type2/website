Subject: VW USA and Warranty Claims

Many thanks to those who responded to my &quot;Temperature Related Performance
Problems&quot; posting last week, and shared the information in Technical
Bulletin 24-92-01 which describes a decade long problem [fuel starvation
symptoms after extended constant speed driving] and the cure [either wiring
harness part number 025 906 302---$100 or a self installed capacitor] with
my 1986 Vanagon GL.  I complained to my dealer and wrote VW USA about this
problem (1987-89).  Needless to say the symptoms never could be replicated
in the shop but my dealer did replace a number of components under warranty
which, of course, did not solve the problem. Eventually I gave up and
decided to live with the annoyance--until I found this group and the
relevant 1992 technical bulletin last week.

Since last week I have contacted another dealer in my region [the one I
bought the car from and originally dealt with is out of business] and the
customer representative at VW USA.  I outlined the problem with reference to
the Technical Bulletin and some specifics of my particular case.  Both were
friendly and sympathetic but not helpful.  The dealer said he could not act
without authorization from VW.  The rep at VW USA said I should be happy
about getting 10 years and 110,000 miles out of a vehicle, but they couldn't
get into waranty claims that old.

Do you think I have much chance of getting the fix [part number 025 906 302]
from VW as a continuing warranty claim?  Most of the discussions with the
now defunct dealership were verbal, although I do have receipts for the
attempted fixes, and have kept copies of the correspondence with VW USA (my
letter of complaint with the symptoms and their referral back to the
dealership.)  If so, does anyone know who to write as the next step?  

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

                                           John Foster
