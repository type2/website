Subject: Yeehaaar. No road tax for me.


Todays papers reports that the UK goverment is planning
on scrapping road tax for vehicles over 25 years old `in
a move to help owners of classic cars'.

Well my bus was first registered in 1970, so by the time I
get it back on the road (any time this century would be nice)
it will no longer be liable for tax. About 130 pounds a year
that can go on, well petrol I suppose. 

Opponents of the scheme say this will create a `demand for 
old bangers' as people try to avoid paying the tax. Which
I imagine will boost the prices of the early bay windows a bit. 

cheers
