Subject: Five Year Dream Car Pick


Okay, everyone, I think we should have our own &quot;Five Year Dream Car Pick.&quot;
Same rules, which for your convenience I reproduce here:

...each was asked to pick the car, any car,
he wished. BUT! there's some gotchas!  (I think joel meant &quot;catches&quot;, but
I think maybe &quot;gotchas&quot; and &quot;catches&quot; are pronounced identically in
Alabamese.)

1. they had to live with the car they chose for five years.
2. it was to be their only automobile in those five years.
3. they had to drive it daily to work, to the 7-11, across the country, and
      through michigan winters.
4. after five years, they would give the car back, without depreciation
      affecting him in any way.
5. they would, however, have to foot the bill for maintenance, fuel, tires;
      all non-warranty upkeep would be dollars dragged from their personal
      savings.

So quit bothering with that work you're supposed to be doing and send in
your choice.  Now we'll find out if this really ought to be called the
Vanagon list!
