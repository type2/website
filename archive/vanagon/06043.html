Generators and such....

Looking over the postings of the last couple weeks an interesting irony appears:

One of the places where generators are never heard is at a KOA. People needing
electricity of the 120V alternating current variety are simply plugged in, 
leaving their annoying generators quiet. 

Pete Sellers kids might have fun in the pool or in the game room too. I'm no 
big fan of KOA type campgrounds but my kids prefer them to all other travel 
accomodations.
