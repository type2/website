Subject: Wanted Front Seats for 73 Van (Connecticut Area)

Hi folks,

I'm looking for front drivers and passenger seats out of a 73 van in the 
Connecticut area.  These would have the headrests or at least the proper 
seat back with slots to mount the headrests.

If you're around CT/MA area and you have these drop me an email.
