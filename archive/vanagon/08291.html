&gt; &gt; Well, gang,
&gt; &gt; Here's a fairly important question ... How does one tow an injured vanagon
&gt; &gt; say 1000 miles?  What special things will need to be removed?
&gt; &gt; Why, you might ask, would I ever ask such a silly question?  Well she
&gt; &gt; who must be obeyed and I are going to take the vanagon from montana to
&gt; &gt; virginia in a few days and if it dies, I'll come back to montana and pull
&gt; &gt; it back with my pickup.  Looking through the various books, I don't really
&gt; &gt; see any information about what to do if you need to tow the thing for more
&gt; &gt; than 50 miles.  I know that Mark towed his over 1000 miles once, but his
&gt; &gt; transmission was already dead at that point.  Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt; PS: I am taking my computer with me.  If we get stuck, I'll post ...

&gt; the front bumper give nothing to hang onto, have someone weld a good bracket,
&gt; I hadno problem towing mine behind a 84 Nissan 4x4,,,
&gt; 
Towed mine from Calif (Bay area) to Utah (750 miles). I bolted a bracket which
connected to the tow bar to the bumper brackets. I guess i was lucky that the
width was almost perfect. I had to rig some spacers to get the tow bar 
brackets square. Once done, I had no problems towing with my 4-cyl Cherokee.
Admittedly it was a little slow over Donner Pass.
