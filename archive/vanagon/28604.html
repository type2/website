Hey now

I was riding the subway into work this morning, flipping through the
11/6 New Yorker magazine.  On page 17, there's an ad for Transamerica
bank - the scene is a street in San Francisco at night with a swell
view of the Transamerica building.  Parked on the left side of the 
street is a blue &amp; white breadloaf!
