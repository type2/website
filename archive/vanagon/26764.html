Subject: Re: Cargo Hauls

Firewood, tightly packed and level with the head rests, 1 cord, 4' x 4' x 8' 
is the dimensions. Probably 1800lbs. Van sat on its rubber bump stops, went 
fine, slow on the brakes at 60mph&lt;g&gt;.

Concrete blocks, 40lbs each, 40 of them in the middle of the van. 4 ply 
front tires were almost flat, rear 6 ply looked normal. Dove real slow that 
time.

The '85 panel had a 900Kg rating, ie 1 ton, so I figure it wasn't really 
abusing it.  Tim Smith
