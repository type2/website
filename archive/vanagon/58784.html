Some esteemed vanagonut said he's found a store (Kirkams perhaps) in SLC that
will make a bag for his vanagon or at least one to fit the rack on top of said
vanagon.  $115 is a STEAL!  There's probably 75$ worth of canvas and zipper 
in there.  Drop by Kirkhams an price the good stuff.  Go for the 115$US custom
bag and have em keep the pattern so the other vanagoneers can make use of it
perhaps.
