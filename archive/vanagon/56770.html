&gt;Ron, the stuff you're referring to is probably called Aero-Kroil and is
&gt;made by Kano Laboratories.  I've always seen it in an orange colored
&gt;spray can.  I've used it for years as a super penetrating oil for just
&gt;the sort of situations that you describe.  Its every bit as good as you
&gt;say.  I used to have access to it through my work, but that is no longer
&gt;the case.  I've wondered what I'll do when my supply finally runs out! 
&gt;If you actually find a commercial source for this stuff, it would
&gt;probably be worth a post to the list.

Kano Labs, the supplier of Kroil, is listed on my Vendors page under 'Tools':

    Kano Laboratories, Inc.
    1000 South Thompson Lane
    Nashville, TN 37211-2627 

    1-615-833-4101
    1-615-833-5790 fax 

    Kroil (the oil that creeps) is a penetrating lubricant that is
    effective in loosening even the rustiest bolts. It costs about
    US $4 for an 8 ounce bottle, and $6 for the aerosol version.

As always, see
