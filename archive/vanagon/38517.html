Subject: Licence Plates (front)

What do you do to keep a licence plate on the front of a 70s bus? 

It seems that free-hanging plate gets scrunched by parking lot cement
blockers, hung up on campground logs, and generally becoming detached from
the vehicle. This morning as I was backing out from a parking spot I heard
a ping and saw a piece of the plasic bolt retainer go flying away across
the lot. I stopped, got out, and picked the bent plate out of the snow
bank. If I didn't have the spare mounted on the front, I'd simply mount
the plate by the bottom holes. 

John
