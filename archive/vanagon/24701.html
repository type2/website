Subject: alaska\yukon travel books.

...by far the best off-the-beaten-track travel guide is the &quot;ALASKA-YUKON-
HANDBOOK&quot;, originally by David Stanley (don't know who wrote the 2nd
edition...), Moon publ. i think. it's particularly good if you're the
outdoorsy type/travel on the cheap side. when i was hitchhiking up there a
couple of years back i found their tips to be right on ! fun to read, too,
compared to the Dan Rather-like style of the MILEPOST...
   my 0.02 $can worth...
