Yet another one of my pet peeves.  I prefer to diagnose the problem 
myself, and then instruct the shop to do the work I want.  If what I 
wanted would not fix the problem, then do it anyway, at least I will 
have a new part, and that will rule out that item as a problem maker.

If a shop refuses to do this, I go someplace else.  I've even told shops 
to not diagnose my problem because I have done it already.  Just do the 
work I want.  Some do it and some don't.  Bottom line:  Do It Youself (if 
at all possible....)
