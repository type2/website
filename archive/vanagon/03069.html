Attn Joel&gt; You were helping me with the problem the Vanagon was having
with hot starting. You suggested replacing the O2  sensor which I did
(the numbers you provided matched perfectly BTW). The idle is
definitely better and its still too early to tell but I think, mileage
might might  improve as  will acceleration. The old owner's receipts
from 1992 suggested that the O2 sensor be replaced but I guessed I
missed that... While I was at it I put in new slightly colder Bosch
plugs and moved the head tem gauge sensor from the head sensor
location to spark plug no. 3. The difference is quite noticeable
between the two locations. Whereas previosuly the head temp would not
budge above 220 it now sits at about 300F. Still both are below the
halfaway mark of 350F on the gauge.

My questions are twofold: a) will I have to reset the fuel mixture given
the new sensor or will the O2 sensor automatically compensate? and b) the
hot start problem is still there. It wants to run, and starts fine
cold but still takes three 8 second cranks of the key before it will
fire. You mentioned checking the thermo switch and the pressure valve.
The pump was replaced about 2 years ago. I guess I should check for
spark first eh? BTW the coil is made in ....wait for
it...Slovenia..that breakaway state of former Yugoslavia (it is less
than 6 months old_) but would be my guess if the problem is
electrical. The idle module is also new as is the high throttle switch.

Thanks in advance - DC
