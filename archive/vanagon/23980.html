My sentiments exactly.  In fact, I have a very nice sticker on my back 
window that says exactly that in big bold letters: 

MEAN
PEOPLE
SUCK!

I like it.

PS: About the sticker: I got mine from the Erotic Bakery in Seattle.  
They have an assortment of colours, too.  I also have the &quot;Darwin&quot; 
take-off of the born-again Christain fish (not phish!) thing you see 
everywhere.  The &quot;Darwin&quot; fish has little feet on it, and says &quot;DARWIN&quot; 
across the body.  I like that one, too!  :)
