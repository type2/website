This is ridiculous:

	Someone broke into my bus last night, by jimmying open the sliding
window on the driver or passenger side, I don't know which first 'cause
they were both open.  And they left them open!

	The horn button had been taken off, and was laying on the seat.  The
driver's door was ajar, but locked. Somehow they got it open even though it
was locked!

	Nothing was missing, but it looked like they were on a hunting 
expedition!

	This is getting old, fast!  I'm tempted to try the gas can trick again.

	I fear the day I decide to put the roof rack on - I don't think it
will last long!

	Sorry, just had to get this out.
