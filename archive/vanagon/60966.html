&lt;&lt; in your reply to my &quot;brave new world&quot; thoughts you mentioned a &quot;new
microbus&quot; 
 in connection with the &quot;new Beetle&quot;. This morning while queueing at the Audi

 shop I glanced through a late issue of &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; the german VW mag.
 
 They presented a design study called Concept 2 with lots of remenisences to 
 the T1 Microbus. Was that the one you were talking about ?
 
 The article said it had been drawn by an englishman and was published also
in 
 &quot;VW Speed&quot;.
 
 As soon as I have my scanner fixed again I will send a sample.
 
 Bye Tom N.
 
 PS. Anybody on the list who knows details about that Concept 2 ?
  &gt;&gt;


In Hot VW's a few issues back there were some concept van &quot;retro splittie&quot;
drawings by a man named Steve Stanford. Pretty cool renderings.

VW needs a good kick in the pants and start building this thing. People
wanted the Bug (Concept 1) and they're building it, so why not a concept bus?

p.s. - check out the new issue of &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine - the one w/ the &quot;new
Bug&quot; on the cover- there's a good article on it.  The &quot;new Bug&quot; is due out
late next year.
