&gt;How to get the listmembers to adopt this plan (this thread seems to 
&gt;rear its ugly head every 4-6 months) is the question.
&gt;
&gt;Based on past performance, I doubt it will happen.  Understand I'm 
&gt;not berating the idea.  I find it helpful to see the year of the 
&gt;vehicle in the subject header when I'm reading along, so I always 
&gt;post my year when approptiate.
&gt;
&gt;To each is own.   Unless we can get Stalin to moderate the list!  &lt;g&gt;

4-6 months?  Jeez, seems like someone has a plan like this every 4-6 DAYS!
:-)  Just put the year of your ride in the subject line (you'll get more
response that way anyhow) or a general description of what you're talking
about if it's something non-year-specific like stickers or camping.  No need
for complicated syntax, IMHO.
