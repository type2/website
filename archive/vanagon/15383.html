&gt; I need to redirect this question - I asked about what type of lubricant

&gt; One more time folks - what kind of lube works best to quiet the sliding 
&gt; door? One thought of rubber wheels was interesting, but I don't think 
&gt; anyone has made that work - have they? 
&gt; 
I should think wheel bearing grease would work.  Anyone know what would 
work better?

Also, cleaning the tracks and rollers really thoroughly would quiet a 
little of the rumble.
