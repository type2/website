&gt;i got this from the honda list:
&gt;gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com:2100/11/showroom/edmunds
&gt; --  OR  --
&gt;gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com:2100/11/showroom/edmunds/make
&gt;
&gt;This is the online Edmund's car price guide which has the invoice prices
&gt;for just about every car, including Honda and Acura.
&gt;
&gt;..
&gt;for those of you (like me) without all that fancy URL and WWW stuff,
&gt;try gophering to just
&gt;gopher.enews_dot_com
&gt;that got me a menu of a whole bunch of stuff. :)
