Thanks for all of the advice

Over the holiday I will take a look at the switch and try the
suggestions. My memory is poor, but the part number Joel mentioned
sounds about right; ZVW-123-251 

Have a great Holiday

Becks

BTW I had my van up in the snow for the second time with my new Nokia
Hakkappkdlksfdljsdf 10 snow tires, man they work great and the van rides
like a dream!
