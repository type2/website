Subject: 88 or newer camper Wanted

Hi Volks,
   I'm sending this note for a friend of mine who had an unforunate
accident with his 88 Westy GL.   He's looking for 88 or newer Westy to buy.
If anyone has or knows where one is FS please e-mail me or call ED at
(603) 778-0915.  He's quite bummed about this so finding  a new one to
replace it would be a big pick me up.  Thanks and Take care.
