Aside from the first guy asking (in English) about buying a bus in
England coz car inspections there are, shall we say, very liberal
(kinda like here in Texas...it runs, it passes), so that he can
experience Europe on the cheap, the rest of the posts (in German) were
about fine leathers (clothing, that is) for you motorcycle types out
there.  Now that does bring up a thought...instead of flannel flags
flying from the antenna, how about some nice little leather
thingies...?
