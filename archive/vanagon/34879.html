Subject: re: '75 in CV hell...

	Ruthie,
	Did you ever get that last bolt out? 
	Someone suggested sawing off the head, and I
haven't seen any comment on the subject since.

	I gotta agree with everything you said about working
on clean stuff- since I work on my cars in part for pleasure, I
make sure I have a clean car to work on. Makes all the difference.
Also and especially CV bolts- when I was taking mine appart, there were
three CV bolts (of 24) that I couldn't get loose. My brother showed up,
cleaned them thoroughly and got them removed in under 45 minutes. 
*I* figured I could take it apart and THEN clean it... Dumb.
	
	I'm a big believer in easy-outs, using mine at least once a year
for some old piece of equipment. I've only ever had one bolt fragment that
the easyout couldn't remove, and it was a steel bolt in an aluminum head.
It had been 8mm, I drilled and tapped it for 1/4&quot;-20 and replaced the
new bolt regularly :)

	I recently bought the Griot's Garage set of left-handed drills
and easyouts and while I can't claim the leftie drills have solved any
problem completely, I DO feel better about torquing the remains in
a direction I want them to go versus tightening something I want loosened.
Last thing i used them on were completely shot set-screws for my fiance's
closet door knobs. I was able to extract the set-screw from each, chaised
the threads with the correct tap (quarter-turn, back off a quarter turn,
half turn, back off a quarter, half forward, quarter back, that's progress)
and fit new set screws. I felt like Hephestis (who forged thunderbolts for
Zeus) and Jean doesn't have to use a screwdriver to get her coat to go out.

	Cheers!
	Bill
