&gt;We are painting the Westy because it is in excellent shape but has some
&gt;scratches and faded paint. We would like to return it to its original
&gt;condition.

Have you considered just polishing the paint. I used a rubbing compound on
the old 75 bus and uncovered some beautiful, new-looking, paint beneath
the oxidized layer. It's a somewhat tedious job by hand, though, but much
cheaper. 2 people can do it in a day.
