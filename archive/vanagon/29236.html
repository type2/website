Subject: '73 van, Water in Oil 

I was driving my van about on Saturday with no problems, however, 
on Sunday morning I went to start the engine but it would only do
a quarter(ish) turn before stopping dead.
Upon investigation I find that there is rather a lot of water in the
oil - more water than oil :( If this was a goodly water cooled van then
there might be some logical explanation that I could think of. As it
is I'm stumped.
The temperature at the time was around 0 degrees Centigrade and there
was a whitening of ice around both carburetors - is this normal?

Can anyone explain how any water can get in the oil, I noticed that the
rubber grommet type thing at the bottom of the dipstick tube was a bit
shot away, but this is a small hole for water to get in ? and there has
been no rain for the last day or so.

I have now drained all the yuk out of the engine and replaced the oil.
What else can I do to ensure that all the water has disappeared?

Could any replies be copied to my address as I'm on digest at the mo...

Baffled
