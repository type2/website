&gt; Hi all-
&gt; 
&gt; Martha's mention of a trip to Tierra del Fuego inspired a lot of us,
&gt; especially those who have read Tim Cahill's book Road Fever, about his trip
&gt; from the tip of South America to Alaska.  This reminded me of other great
&gt; books about wanderlust, which is probably what led all of us to drive VW
&gt; campers in the first place.  The first I can remember reading as a child
&gt; was John Steinbeck's &quot;Travels With Charley In Search of America&quot;.  Later I
&gt; particularly remember William Least Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways&quot; and
&gt; Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainence.&quot;  Anybody know any
&gt; similar books that I may have missed over the years?
