The 1989 has carryover features from 1988 including:
2 Black plastic front grills (common to 1986-1991)
Rectangular primary headlights, seperate square high beam lights

The 1989 GL Vanagons had black aero styled bumpers without matching 
rocker panels and black outside rearview mirrors. 
The Carat model included rocker panels to match the
aero styled bumpers. These bumpers and rocker panels 
are metalic grey.  Carat models came with body colored outside
rearview mirrors.
