I'm considering the trip, I'm in SLC, UT.  Anything that makes this more
doable is fine by me.

&gt;   it might be worth taking a
&gt; &gt; straw poll on:
&gt; &gt; what people are looking for in a site;

&gt; &gt; how long they're willing to travel to get there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My guess is that most people are coming from the I-5 corridor, between
&gt; &gt; Everett and Eugene (perhaps some B'ham folks), and would consider more
than
&gt; &gt; 1 day travel in each direction to be a bit too much, even for a 3-day
&gt; &gt; weekend!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps there is something in the Columbia Gorge area, maybe up near Mt
Hood?
&gt; &gt; That's probably 5+ hours from Seattle. Also, there are some funky spots
on
&gt; &gt; the Washington side of the Gorge I've driven by before - but the
&gt; &gt; windsurfing crowd may  have overrun them by now.
&gt; &gt; Another area may be near Mt Adams - Gifford Pinchot National Forest -
&gt; &gt; although that's still a long drive around from Seattle. You get about 3
&gt; &gt; miles from the Pacific Crest Trail there though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I still like the Mt St Helens area but if you go into the north section
you
&gt; &gt; have to pay $. On the south side, it s &quot;free-for-all&quot; camping. Just
find a
&gt; &gt; spot large and flat enough, and it's yours.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The key may be if people are looking for some funky out-of-the-way
place or
&gt; &gt; are willing to take over a section of a more mainstream campground, say
&gt; &gt; like Fort Canby.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; anyway, what do other folks think? I'm still likely to do it anyway but
I
&gt; &gt; wasn't aware of just how far east you were talking about until tonight!
&gt;
&gt; Rick's concern might be an issue, or not. Personally, I don't mind the
&gt; day long drive from Eugene (on the contrary, its a chance to enjoy my
&gt; Westie) but I see how this can affect others coming from BC, CA, or even
&gt; WA. THIS IS PRECISELY WHY WE NEED A LOT OF FEEDBACK ASAP!
&gt; Do we stick to the Cascades/I-5 corridor/coast (see some suggestions
&gt; above), or do we go for the more adventurous, unknown and sunny proposed
&gt; campsite in Eastern OR?
