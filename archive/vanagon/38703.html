&gt; hi y'all,
&gt; Couple of questions about vanagon paint jobs (on an 87 westy).
&gt; 
&gt; 1. were stock poptops ever painted to match body color? I saw one like this
&gt; (in red), but thought they were always white (w/black trim). Is this the sign
&gt; of a 2nd paint job, or did some have custom choice to match paint body and
&gt; pop?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. How much would it cost to get a reasonably good job (for both?)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for any help here... and if anyone happens to have
&gt; done the job themselves, or knows a great resource for such,
&gt; would love to know.  :)

The archives contain the answer to your first question. According to the 
information for Model-Years-1980-1991, this started in 1987.  I can't 
estimate the cost for the second.  I'm sure others on the list have had 
this done, or done it , and can address it.
