Subject: Re: Drivers Wanted Stickers

My next door neighbour is an Ad Rep for Arnold Advertising (VW's ad
agency).  His one and only client is VW.  I have left him a message to see
if he can get any surplus stickers or other promo items.  I'll post a
message if I come up with anything.

&gt;I still have several feelers out for some more of the elusive &quot;drivers 
&gt;wanted stickers&quot; that I recently gave away.  Just letting everyone know 
&gt;that I'm still looking, and haven't given up yet.  Called VW of US, no 
&gt;stickers, but they're sending me a catalog and a &quot;drivers wanted&quot; key 
&gt;chain.  The rep said he can send one-to-a-customer to whoever calls 
&gt;their 800 number (800) 822-8987.
