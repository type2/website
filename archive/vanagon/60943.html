Subject: Syncro Parts Page Update
Date: Thu, 5 Jun 1997 11:37:54 -0400

I fixed the broken link on the parts page, thanks for pointing it out Tim
S. and Mark M. Not too good for me when people don't know where to send the
money :-) It seems the server is a little too case sensitive. Also, I can't
figure out why the frames version isn't working with Netscape. 

Even if you're not interested in parts, go to the page to see the pictures
of the parts van. It's got a really silly paint job.
