Please pardon my surgery on the quoted message...I'll try to put [] every 
time I cut.

&gt; The goods are information and analysis that people can use to survive in this

I like that.

&gt; Put another way, I
&gt; think we can all agree that Joel delivers the goods when he posts internal VW
&gt; technical documents, types in a Trailer Life article, or much of the rest of
&gt; the time. 
Yeah right -- how about Robert Service style poetry?  Serious fun.

&gt; The idea of the /f indicator in the subject heading was a great idea somebody
it was [F] or [f] and it should be at the beginning of the subject 
because a lot of mailers don't display the end of long subjects.

&gt; Now, I wonder if my message will cause someone to accuse me of being a
&gt; Control Freak and cause them to have a public psychotic episode on the list
&gt; before unsubscribing. (That *was* weird, wasn't it?)

Yeah.  I'm going to accuse you of being a Control Freak and then

Don't pay too much attention to the numbers in the stats. They get quite 
skewed by people whose email adddresses change or who post from different 
addresses. It's a fun measure, and there's do doubt who the real 
loudmouth is, but I wouldn't do any true statistics based on that.

&gt; had sort of assumed that we all knew our vans were not practical vehicles and
&gt; that we employed this list to make them more so.

This is the sentence that made me respond. My response is Whoa!!!
&quot;not practical vehicle?&quot;  I've got one for sale if that's the case.  I 
bought the thing because I thought it was a practical vehicle.  There 
wasn't enough room in a minivan and a full sized van was too hard to 
drive around town.  I hope you'll retract or modify that statement.
