&gt; Crusing rec.autos.vw, there was a message about how the oil galley plugs would
&gt; -- pop out of someone's 82 vanagon during a cold start. Someone mentioned
&gt; this might be due to hot/cold cycles and/or overheating. So fill me in, I
&gt; have never heard of these plugs. Where are they? What do they look like?
&gt; and what happens if they pop out? Any experiences/information would be
&gt; helpful...TIA - DC

&gt; A guy who used to work with me, and who has an '82, called  to tell
  me about exactly the problem you described above. I wouldn't be
  surprised if it was the same person. If so, here's the rest of the
  story: Oil= 20W-50  Outside temperature=About 30 degrees F.
