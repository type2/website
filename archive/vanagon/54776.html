Subject:      Canceled trips, and Carpet for Itchi!

Hey all...

the trip to oregon has been cancled...kirs realized what kind of shape
the car is really in..:)

anhow, due to all kinds of things happenign this week, it looks like i'm
heading back home to Georgia tomoorow, maybe friday at th latest...

if i wasnt in such a rush, i'd stop in a few places and say hi....

oh well!

so, all you concerned, (you know who you are...) just letting you know...


Now.._dot_carpet!!

I went to work today, and got pisse when they told me they wernt going o
pay me for last weeks work (what? i go pissed? nah...) and told them
where to put it, and came home...

Pulled out the carpet i'd gotten out of the trash pile ofa 350thou$ house
a few days earlier, and started installing it..

The PO had put some cheapish carpet in it, and it was beggining to
show...dirty (now..) and gapping, and all that...

I pulled out the fridge and jump seat, and got to work...

as soon as i get my hands on a sharp pair fof scisors, it will even allow
air out the rear heater outlet...(sheepish grin..)

it loks fairly good, for my first carpet install...

i just wish i had my hands on a good industrial sewing machine so i could
stick some (the word just went to never never lnd...:( basscilly
reinforcment..) on the edges..

oh well...tomorrow, or so i'll have the machne to do it with...

anyow, just rambling on....


....david..
