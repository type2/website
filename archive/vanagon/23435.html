&gt; &gt;You think so?  I don't.  A multilayer fine mesh paper filter with lots
&gt; &gt;of surface area is hard to beat.

&gt; Well I didn't say they were perfect ;-], the one thing they do is
&gt; filter well but, they aren't cheap, they leak, they are a pain to
&gt; maintain, they.....  For ease of use, cost,  simplicity and airflow a
&gt; paper filter is better, but if the only thing you are looking at is
&gt; absolute filtering power the oil-bath airfilter is hard to beat.
&gt; Most miltary vehicles for example had oil-bath filters when paper has
&gt; been the standard for years, they do this to protect the engine, more
&gt; than concern for ease of use. I've had to change these things off and
&gt; on and I have allways been amazed at what they clean out of the air.
&gt; Mind you I also remember grumbling away at why they just didn't put a
&gt; bloody paper filter in the thing ;-], mind you military equipment tend
&gt; not to have much to do with normal day to day reality. All things
&gt; said I still wouldn't put one in my car if I could help it. ;-]

Come on guys! You have to do an oil change and valve adjustment every
3000 miles anyway. It takes 2.6 quarts or litres fo fill the
crankcase. You are already greasy and covered with oil, so why not
clean out the oil-bath air cleaner while you are at it, and dump the
remaining .4 litre of oil in the oil bath. Where I buy oil (Kragen),
the cost is about $.89 per quart, so replacing the oil in the oil bath is 
only $.38, tax included. That's a lot cheaper than a paper element,
and guaranteed not to rip, tear, or get oil fouled.
