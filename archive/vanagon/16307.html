&gt;Derek proclaims that he received a message from Germany...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think I sent it to the Bulli Cartel, which is some kind
&gt;&gt;of Germany VW bus mag.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to dissapoint you Derek, but the Bulli Cartel is a group of
&gt;fanatical followers of Theodore Roosevelt...  ;-)
