&gt; David &quot;Sherlock&quot; Carment enquires;

&gt; Several weeks ago, I posted a message about how the brake fluid reservoir
&gt; had dropped to a dangerously low level just below the take up tube to the
&gt; clutch master cylinder.Result? Clutch pedal goes to the floor with no
&gt; clutch action. Since then I had filled the reservoir 
&gt; and was able to &quot;pump  up&quot; the system to again have a working clutch. Now
&gt; today I went outside to do the weekly start-up (the Westy is in storage-no
&gt; point in ruining it with the salt on the roads). Guess what? The fluid is
&gt; down exactly at the point just below the clutch fluid tube. Normally I would
&gt; say &quot;ok there is definitely a leak somewhere&quot;. BUT, I can't find a leak
&gt; anywhere and since the van hasn't moved in all this time, you would think
&gt; a puddle would be reasonably easy to see. What gives? Are my eyes failing
&gt; me? Has the fluid vapourized?  Has it been transported to a distant
&gt; planet? 
&gt;

  Is the carpet under the dash damp? Maybe the clutch master cylinder or one
  or it's connections is leaking behind the dash and the drips are hiding
  &quot;under the rug&quot;.
