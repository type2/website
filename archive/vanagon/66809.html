&lt;&lt; Concerning the panel from an Audi fitting the vanagon I've looked at
 several in the junkyards over the couple of days and haven't seen one
 that would fit without some cutting.  these were out of Audis and Jettas
 ,did you take a bandsaw to the console or am I looking at the wrong
 models. The one that fits is out of an Audi 4000s correct?

this is the triple gauge bezel from the center console out of a '81-'84 audi
4000.  the gauges are tilted slightly towards the driver, and the sides of
the gauge panel are angled, which nicely conforms to the center console
heater plastic cover panel in the Vanagon.
yes, you have to cut an opening in your center console heater plastic cover
panel to accept the gauge panel cluster. also you may need to trim off the
plastic tabs on the back of the gauge panel.
