Subject: Florida Love-Bug-Off update

Over the last week I have responded to a bunch of posts from netfolk
interested in attending the Love-Bug-Off.

I responded to most of you (I hope) and at the time asked permission
to post your name as part of our &quot;attendees list&quot; so's other folk could
find out who'll be there (and in what!)

As it stands today about 30 people total from Vanagon,Rec.Arts, &amp; vintage
have responded to my reposts with approx half that committing to the trek.

Don't know how many non-net folk will attend from our local area as friends
in our local FLAPS spoke to volks customers...and well, you know the rest.

I'm still trying to get reservations from Oleno on one, possibly two of the
camping &quot;legs&quot; or areas where camping sites are near enough each other that
the cityfolk won't feel too displaced...

Those folk who would like to come, but don't or can't drive the distance
may be able to &quot;Buddy-up&quot; with someone else from a nearby area. Anybody who
would be willing and able to take a &quot;passenger&quot; or two please contact me so's
I can add you to our &quot;Buddy&quot; list.

I will post the confirmed attendees names in a day or so once I get the rest
of my info together.

REMINDER: This is a &quot;Bring Your Own event&quot; However we will have a sacrificial
alter complete with offerings baskets for those who wish to bring lite dishes
of chewables and grazing fodder to nibble.. The closest town (sic..food store)
is about 8 miles South and consists of a row or two of canned beans and a
cooler stocked with cheap beer... Buy early, stock well and remember paper
plates!
