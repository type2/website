Subject: Re: I finally installed my window A/C


&gt;Now tha summer session is almost over I had the time yesterday to install
&gt;my window A/C.  The unit is a Goldstar and it is 18&quot; long, 12&quot;tall, and
&gt;only 13&quot; deep.

Is this propane? What does it run on? Sheez, it sounds like a marriage-saver. ;)
