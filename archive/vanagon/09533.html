&gt;   In late March most of the passes over the Sierra to Hwy 395 are still closed.
&gt;  Access to 395 involves taking hwy 80 or 50 up around L. Tahoe or looping down
&gt;   underneath via Bakersfield. 

The latter is what I had in mind.  To get to Red Rock Canyon, take 99 South
to Bakersfield, then 58 East to Mojave, and up 395 about 20 miles.

After looking at Joshua Tree/Twentynine Palms, I see it is at least 500
miles from the Bay area.  I don't think anyone will want to drive those
kind of miles.  

&gt;   BTW, It's STILL raining!

It rained on me the entire trip back to San Diego, until about 40 miles
from home.  I think my bus experienced more rain in the last 3 days than
it had in its entire lifetime previously.  :/
