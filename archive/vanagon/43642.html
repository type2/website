Subject: rusting 65

Hello all:

        Thanks for the many replies so far.  The problem remains, however,
and here's why.  I said something about fixing the rust (around the front
jacking point) &quot;in a hurry.&quot;  What I meant by that was not can I do a quick
and easy fix on this, but rather what shoudl be done right away?  And for
that matter, what can I do to fix the damage done and prevent more damage
(Thanks Clara, I already got those seals...)?

Thanks again from me, my gf Anne, and her bus Gertie

Eric
