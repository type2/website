Subject: Old bus sighting, Value? and Rebuild

Hello Everyone, 
	I've seen a bus parked not to far from the U of W,  it is a 7 
door panel van.  From the bullet lights, I guess it is '57 to '60.  It 
also has small rear lights, and turn handle for the rear hatch.  It has 
no visible rust,  and it appears to be an operational van (gets moved).  
What is the value ($, not spiritual) of a vehicle like this?
	I can not buy some thing like this now anyway but this list has 
me interested, it doesn't hurt to look.  I have to get the '81 Westy out 
of my garage before I can do anything else.  If I can finish my rebuild 
I'll be able to go on the PNW camping trip!
	By the way my 2.0l heads are back from Mark Stephens, they are now 
going to warranty their rebuilds will not drop a seat in 200,000 miles, or 
5 years. In a moment of weakness I decided to upgrade the intake valves 
on my heads, $30 per head, was this a waste of money?  

	Thank You.
