Subject: RE: engine removal 71 bus


&gt;I am going to pull the engine on my 71 bus and am wondering if anyone
&gt;knows the most efficient way to remove the four bolts holding the engine
&gt;to the transmission.  Any help would be appreciated.

On my old '69 (which I *think* is similar), I put a jack under the
engine, unbolted and removed the rear engine hanger bar, then lowered
the engine about 4&quot;. It lets you reach the two upper bolts a LOT
easier. If you stick your head waaaaayyy in there, you can actually
see them! You can also undo the fuel hose from the metal line from
above this way instead of from below, thus avoiding a gasoline bath.

Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '71 VW Transporter, never pulled the engine
                              '80 V6anagon, hope I never have to
