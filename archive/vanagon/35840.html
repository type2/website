Subject: Re: My new Westy - '82 diesel at home

Hello Martin.  I would agree with engine temps being lower in the 
diesel versus gas engines.  My mother-in-law has 1.8 litre gas Golf, 
and we have the diesel Golf.  The gas engine bay is waaayy hotter than the 
diesel's engine bay.  Not sure on operating temperatures (internal), 
but my radiator fan has yet to come on for my diesel in 191000 km !!  
The temp gauge doesn't go past half way mark on my the diesel's 
gauge, and goes a little higher on the gas engine's.

In fact, to warm a diesel up you have to run it.  Idling, they don't 
even get warm.  After a long, fast run, and then idle for a few 
minutes they will actually cool off -- without the aid of the rad 
fan.  Experienced same phenomenon on a Toyota LandCruiser 3.4 litre 
diesel, Jeep Cherokee 2.1 Litre Turbo Diesel, and our Golf.

For extreme climates, a change in thermostat temperature ranges might 
be applicable along with a board in front of the radiator grille, 
etc.  I live on the &quot;wet&quot; coast, and it doesn't get cold enough to 
hinder warmup.

&gt; I would think that the vw diesel requires less cooling than the corresponding
&gt; gas engine. The 2.0 GTI gas engine has basically the same block and head
&gt; design as the 1.6 diesel, but the 2.0 GTI engine generates more than twice 
&gt; as much waste heat at full power compared to the 1.6 diesel. Don't the
&gt; VW gas engines do fine with the same oil cooler setup as the stock Vanagon
&gt; and the turbo diesel uses? (If I remember correctly the Rabbit/Jetta
&gt; non turbo 1.6 diesel came without an oil cooler at all)
&gt; 
&gt; With the winters we have here in Rochester NY I would appreciate some 
&gt; way of keeping the engine temperature UP. I can hardly use the heater
&gt; without having the temperature dip into the &quot;unfilled square&quot; first
&gt; part of the scale.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I completely wrong or?
&gt;
