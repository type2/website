Durby,

Seems like that place would make it a pain in the ---- to swap out your
CD's (especially while driving ;).  Have you considered placing it
behind the driver's seat on that little storage tray between the
driver's seat and the rear seat?  That spot is fairly inconspicuous if
your worried about theft, and I'm sure some camoflauge could be made to
make it even more inconspicuous.  And, if you get tired of the 10 (or
however many) CD's, you can easily pull over and swap them out or get a
passenger to do it for you.  We've got a trunk mounted one in a
different car, and the location makes it a major pain.  Especially when
travelling and we've got the trunk loaded with suitcases and such.
