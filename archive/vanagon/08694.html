&gt; why would jim want to 'wait for Joel's opinion'?? :) hell, you guys have
&gt; already told him what to look for, what to do, how to dress, and who's
&gt; coming to dinner!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; geez, i love this list!!
&gt; 
&gt; ok. calmly now. we have to set a goal for next year. in 1995, we have to
&gt; get ALLLLLL the buses in america on this list!!! Today, Internet! Tomorrow,
&gt; The World!!!
&gt; 
&gt; well,ok. maybe that's a bit ambitious. how bout: Today, Tuscaloosa! Tomorrow,
&gt; Amarillo?? ;)
&gt; 
&gt; there is a nagging thought in the back of my head about all this. do you guys
&gt; (and gals) realize that there is a Muir-like book in all this??  If everybody
&gt; 'published' what the problem was, what they did to fix it, etc., and we put
&gt; all that stuff together ... well, not to blaspheme or anything, but Muir was
&gt; just one guy, with a few chickens and goats for help. lookit how many buses
&gt; we've got to work with. admittedly, we're gonna have some disagreement ...
&gt; but then, not Everybody agrees with what Muir or even Bentley says.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, it's just a thought right now. lemme know what you think.

Yeah, but how do we divide the royalties? Or do we forego the royalties
and aim for a paperback version and flood the market?And who gets
the movie rights (possible title - The Life and Times of Joel
B.Walker- roadside mechanic on the
superinformation highway and his trusty sidekick Gerry &quot;oilcan&quot; Skerbitz-with
Newman and Redford in the starring roles of course).

 Seriously though a
book needn't be fancy - ie. it could be a q/a type format in which case we
already have ALL the questions and ALL the answers in the archive. Its
just a matter of  selecting the good questions and editing them along
with the answers.....DC
Subcategories could be created (ie cooling system, brakes etc, extras, etc).
and the answers divided accordingly ( ie most commonly asked questions
blah blah blah). Since there are not that many vanagons in NA, the real
appeal and market  would be based on the inclusion of buses and water-cooled
buses/eurovans....IMHO - I'll have my agent call your agent and we'll do
lunch - Hasta La Vista Baby - DC
