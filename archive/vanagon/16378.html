&gt;Derek says:
&gt;&gt;I was able to knock one of my labels off but I can't get the other label to
&gt;&gt;come off yet. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you think you can remove your label, by all means DO IT. I used a chisel
&gt;&gt;and a sledge hammer and a lot of bending back and forth once it started to
&gt;&gt;come off.

&gt;Also, I assume you had your residual propane vapors bled before you attempted
&gt;this procedure.

Actually, I didn't. 

I don't think it is that important so long as the main tank valve is sealed.
The only danger is actually puncturing the tank but I remember feeling at
the time that I wasn't near to doing that. 

Anyway, you can run into real problems trying to empty your tank as I found
out once before. That is, if you take the tank out and then let it exhaust
is contents away in preparation for this stuff, you could destroy your
regulator, as I did once doing this. I guess you could take the regulator
off first. 

I didn't bother emptying the tank the next time I used wirebrush and drill
to prepare it for painting. The reason this didn't worry me is athat I know
it is wrong but some people test leaks at a tank like this by putting a
match up to it. If a tiny flame ignites, they know there is a slow leak. You
are not supposed to do this, and I have never done it, but some people do.
So if a spark from my drill hit some tiny leak out of the tank I didn't feel
it meant instant death. And anyway, I don't think the main valve has tiny
leaks. It is the regulator that sometimes leaks. 

And by the way, you are right about the time to repaint. While I listed only
5 hours, it also took me a whole week as it did you cause I used Rustoleum
and you have to let the primer dry for, like, two days before applying the
top coat and other tings take time.
