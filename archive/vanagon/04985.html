How about collecting a list of recommended places? Especially
for the cases when you're on the road and forgot to take that
spare engine with you. Also a list of junkers with decent 
Bus parts selection to be thrown in your glove box together
with the Recycled catalogue could be helpful in case.

I've had good experiences with:
  Howard Cooper Imports, 
  2575 S. State St., Ann Arbor MI 48108
  (313)761-3200
They had reasonable repair rates, never ripped me off. I haven't
had any major work done by them, though.

Don't go to the VW/Volvo Dealer in Lebanon, NH. They dearly 
ripped me off with a clutch repair (20h labor) and still did
a shitty job (serious oil leak). (If it only hadn't been so
far from home and so bitterly cold, I'd done it myself.)

My local junker is Recycled in Auburn Hills, of course. They 
served me fine (and cheap) with an axle and a new rear window,
mail order and walk in. Jens.
