Subject: Re: New Top Seal - ' 71 Bus

&gt;&gt;Has anyone had any experience replacing the top camper seal on  a 
1971 Bus?
&gt;&gt;I just received the after market seal from Bus Boys (not a bad price 
either
&gt;&gt;- $69) for my Westy, and as soon as it stops raining, I plan to 
approach
&gt;&gt;this job in the proper Zen-like manner.  Ha!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;(BTW, If anyone knows what the proper Zen-Like manner is, please let 
me know.)
&gt;


I have done two of these seals, one on a 70 Westy and one on a 71.  I 
didn't get them from BusBoys however, but from J.C. Whitster (or 
whatever).  The main part had metal clips imbeded in the plastic, and I 
used contact cement for the seal that goes over the top of the shell.  
The main bottom seal was plenty long enough with a couple of inches to 
spare on each side.  This I easily trimmed with tin-snips.  Overall it 
was a pretty quick, simple job.  Just have to have a tall enough ladder 
:)

Hope this helps!!
