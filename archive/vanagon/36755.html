Subject: PNW camping trip location

Well, I took a little day trip up to Marrowstone Island yesterday and found
what I think is a better spot for the oft-putoff PNW camping trip. The
location is Fort Flagler State Park. Unlike Fort Worden there are a few
trees - it's not quite like camping in a big parking lot! There are 118
sites total, but 47 of them are closed until April. Of the remaining ones,
there are several right along the beach without hookups. There are a couple
of rows with hookups, but there were a lot of RVs there taking them up when
I went through on Saturday afternoon. Beach fires aren't allowed but there
are fire pits. There is a lot of old fort to explore on foot or bike,
(including a closed-off area which is well known to all the students who
attend summer camps on the other side of the park - apparently this is
where all the cool bunkers are.) Great views of Mt Baker and the Olympics
if its clear, Whidbey is right across the Sound. Restrooms with
coin-operated hot showers.

Get there by going across Hood Canal, taking the first right towards Port
Ludlow, driving up towards Port Hadlock, and taking the turnoff for Indian
Island that is a couple of miles south of there. This is about the same
distance, or even slightly closer than Fort Worden, but slightly further
away from Port Angeles which is where Victoria ferry crosses.

Question then is when?
