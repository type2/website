Subject: Installing Oil Temp and Pressure guages in an '81

Hello Everyone,
	Just last week I bought an oil temp sender and an oil pressure sender
from Rocky Mountain Motor Works.  I removed the sump plate on the bottom rear
of the engine and punched a 9/16th hole in it.  I highly recommend using a
punch to put a hole in this plate, it worked beautifully, much better than
drilling, if you can get access to a hole punch.  The oil pressure sender I
bought is the one with warning light provision.  I assumed that this unit
would replace the stock oil pressure sender, but I am having trouble
installing this sender.  I don't see how it is going to fit through the tin
on my '81. Has anyone else installed one of these units?  What did you do? Do
I need a short 1/8th in NPT nipple? What size worked for you? 

	I am quite surprised by the poor quality of instructions that came with 
these VDO senders and gauges, there are no instructions at all with the 
oil pressure sender.  These are not cheap accessories, I expected better.
It seems to me that RMMW could write something to include with these 
units as a custmer services. 

	Thank You.
