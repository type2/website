Subject: Clock for 71 bus

Hello,

I picked up a couple of clocks at the swap meet in Litchfield, CT.  I think 
one is for a bus and the other is for a Type III.  The part numbers are 
311 919 203 D and 311 919 203 B.  I would like to know which one is the 
&quot;correct&quot; one for my 71 westy.  They both fit, but I'm feeling picky.
Any other sticklers out there with the information?

Thanks
