Subject: Philly Gathering....it looks like a go!


We're about to head out for our &quot;mini-road-trip&quot; with the kids to
Nooo JOisey (Great Adventure...no, not being in Joisey, but the
amusement park!&lt;-obligitory Politically Incorrect comment), and
Sesame Place (my worst nightmare would be &quot;Barney Place&quot;)...


BUt I digress....

It looks like there will be 5 of us at this little gathering...
Cetin Seren, Pete Sellers, David Mancuso and John Sharpe.

If anyone else is so inclined here's the deal. We will be
meeting at the main entrance of Sesame Place, Langhorne PA, 
at 5:00pm on Saturday, 7/1, and then probably go across
the street to Oxford Valley Mall for dinner.

See you there!

Ric
