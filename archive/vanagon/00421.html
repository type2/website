	Regarding dual batteries...

	I used to have a notchback, with a huge, power-sucking
stereo system.  I used two Sears car batteries, I can't remember
the exact rating, and an isolator I got at a normal auto parts
store for about $30.  The generator charged up both batteries,
but only the stereo was hooked up to battery #2.  I could run the
stereo for hours until the thing croaked, and then start the car like 
nothing happend!  With this setup, it wouldn't matter if you used 
a deep cycle battery or normal battery, other that maybe for a 
deep cycle battery you might not want to me charging it up all 
the time...?

	Another way to do it is like my friend with a '59 kombi has it:
two 6V batteries in parallel.  This makes starting the car easier, 
and it might not apply to the scenario if you want to use the fridge
and stuff all weekend long without starting the car, but it does overcome
the weak starting problem that 6v's sometimes have...

	My '72 911 also has 2 12V batteries in parallel, in fact all 911's up 
thru '73 had this setup.

Just tryin' to help
