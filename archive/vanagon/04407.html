Now is probably a good time to check and change your windshield wipers. 
Here in Boulder it's snowing. I'm curious to know if anyone has 
recommendations concerning wipers and wiper blades. About two years ago I 
took off the old curved wipers and bought a pair of those winter wipers 
that have the entire assembly shrouded in rubber. They mostly work well 
but I notice they don't cover the extremes of the windshield.

That's definitely SNOW out there.
