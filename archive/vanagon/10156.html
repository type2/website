&gt; Joe's detailed parts manual.  Someone mentioned scanning, but mine's 17 pages
&gt; long and that seems kind of unwieldy:  too much disk space for all of them
&gt; on a server, too long to download, etc.  It's my suggestion we just stick to
&gt; &quot;old fashioned&quot; copies.  Maybe if we could get a list of who has what manual
&gt; for every year from, eg., '67-'79, we could put it in the FAQ?  That way
&gt; if people wanted a copy for their particular year they could just email the
&gt; appropriate person instead of one person being in charge of (and having to
&gt; deal with) all of it.  Just a suggestion.  What does everyone else think?
&gt; 


  I think we should xerox them and send them to Joel &quot;no shortage of shelf
  space here&quot; Walker. My guess is that he would actually read them and then
  regurgitate the pertinant facts contained within when questions come up.
