&gt;1) to the right of the spedo, there is a dummy gauge, was there a factory 
&gt;option gauge for this hole?

It's for the optional clock, but I intalled a tachometer instead. Rocky
Mountain Motorworks sells an adapter ring for that purpose (about $9).

&gt;2) Just under the said gauge hole, there is a red light thingy with a &quot;B&quot; on 
&gt;it.  Anyone know what this is?

That should be the brake warning light. It should go on if one of your 2
brake circuits fails. It will also light up when the ignition is turned on
and will go out after the engine has been started.
