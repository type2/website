&gt;&gt; Anyone have any weekend trips coming up?  We're looking for a weekend 
&gt;&gt; camp trip.  I haven't seen anything from the CCC types in awhile.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Well.... Martha mentioned one in April and I've heard rumors that it
&gt;was going to be possibly at Red Rock State Park, but I'm not sure.
&gt;I think when Martha gets back, she'll probably get the ball rolling
&gt;on it.  Although, she'd probably like someone else to do so.  But
&gt;I just don't think I could meet her high standards. ;)
&gt;

I'm planning on going to Red Rock Canyon State Park with or witout Martha.
 The date is April 26(Friday night) to April 29(Monday).  I expect to do some
Syncro four-wheeling whilst there.  Any joiners??

BTW, This site is located about 25 miles north of Mojave, CA along California

highway 14.
