Subject: Shall I use this type distributor?

List,
In a trade for parts, I got a distributor that I think is from a VW 411 type 
4 engine.  Stamped on the distributor it says the following 3 lines:

JFURX 4
0 231 172 007
022 905 205 E

It has a vacuum advance.  It also appears to have some additional 
connections on the bottom, like maybe points for the FI (?).

Is this OK to use on a type 1 engine?  Type 4 carb bus engine?  Or did it 
have some kind of different advance curve that wouldn't work on a bus?

TIA,
Dean
