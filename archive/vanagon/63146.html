Subject:      Re: Radio static in 84 GL

    You are getting noise, (voltage spikes) on the power line to the
    radio. You need to add a L/C filter. This can be found at your
    locate Radio Shack store. Before you go find out the power
    requirements of the radio.

&gt; We have exact same problem in our '85 Westy.  We too have a replacement

&gt; the heater fan is on you get static but what even more strange is if we
&gt; turn on our headlights ( we always drive with them on in the day too) it
&gt; stops the static.  Go figure!  I'm interested in seeing what the &quot;fix&quot; is
&gt; for this.
