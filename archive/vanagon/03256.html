Think of it this way, joel, those fold down armrests are actually giant,
mutant side bolsters that enable you to push the edge of the envelope
a la Hans Stuck, Derek Bell, et al.

Earlier, Ric and Dave made some interesting observations about various VW
products and it's pretty clear that Europeans *expect* certain things from
their vehicles (handling, ride, safety, stability at speed, etc) whereas
Americans *generally* opt for comfort and gadgets that cause them to be
dangerous (like cupholders...ever wonder why it took Euro
manufacturers so long to stick cupholders in their vehicles?).

I'm certain if all of us expected anything else from our Type IIs we'd be
sitting around reading posts from &quot;caravan_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;...
(juuuust kidding, Gerry!  :-)  )
