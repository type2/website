Subject: Octane ratings


&gt;&gt; 91 octane?!  I beg to differ!  VW engines were built to handle cheap 
&gt;&gt;low quality gas all around the world, like in places where they say 
&gt;&gt;&quot;octane?  what the hel
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;When the VW was designed, 93 octane fuel WAS cheap gas.
&gt;
&gt;The cover to my '68 TII fuel fill says &quot;91 Octane minium&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I feel that if the VW people tell me 91 is what I need, thats good enough 
&gt;for me.
&gt;
&gt;If you run cheap fuel, drop your timing back 2 or 3 degrees to keep from 
&gt;overheating.
&gt;

I guess this is one of those discussions that could have the subject heading
changed to reflect the new suject matter.

I understand octane and timing to be closely related to compression.  More
compression, less timing.  So the 1968 T2 was 7.7:1 and required 91 octane
to run cool at 7.5 deg. BTDC.  The extreme conditions manual states that if
a bus is going where there is questionable fuel, that dished pistons are to
be fitted.  VW lowered to CR several times since then, down to 7.0:1 in
1971, and I think they're down to 6.6:1 these days and aren't whining about
91 octane.  I run 12 deg BTDC on 87 octane with engine compression lowered
to 6.7 or 6.8:1.  

So, y'all should be careful when you ask for a rebuilt or new engine.  Make
sure the builder gets the compression set-up the way you want it.
