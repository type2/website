&gt;  Look at it this way, the real brainy people get jobs as physics
&gt;professors, the less endowed work as car mechanics.

Edmund,

I take exception to this broad generalization.  I did not become a mechanic
because I had nothing better to do, I became a mechanic because of a real
love for equipment and a determined interest in things mechanical.  I also
did not become a mechanic overnight.  It has taken years to grow my skills to
a level that I feel confidant to jump into a badly running vehicle, diagnose
the problem and stake my reputation on my diagnoses every day.  I do this
dependably.  I do not guess.  I do checks.  I do not merely replace parts
until the vehicles run better.  I work very hard for the little bit of money
that I take home every friday.  I offer an excellent value and I am proud to
do what I do for a living.

Yes, anyone with a minor inclination for mechanical things and a service
manual can disassemble and reassemble a Type1 motor.  But that book is not
going to tell you all of the little things that make a truly great motor.
 Cooling system quirks, the perfect sealer for the case halves, ect.   This
can be a costly failure for a first- time rebuilder when you could visit a
decent VW specialist shop and get a well- built type 1 motor with a good
reputation and warranty.

Any VW specialist shop worth it's salt would rebuild a Type 1 dual port motor
for a thousand dollars including installation.  If you can't find one, E-mail
me.  I'll be delighted to serve you all.
