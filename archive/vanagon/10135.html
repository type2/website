Subject: Cabriolets, fighting words, more Westy manual/curtains blather

Sorry for the form of this, but I get the list in digest format and 
replies are a PITA

&gt; 
&gt; first. :)) I ALWAYS stop to help all aircooled VW's, (still can't
&gt; tell the difference between a jetta and cabriolet.)

No problem, Eric: if it has a soft top, it's a Cabriolet (Kabriolett).  
Those Rabbit convertible thingies :-) are mere second-genration Cabbies; VW 
didn't label the bug ones as such after the early-mid fifties.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not exactly.  The steering wheel doesn't come straight up through your
&gt; &gt;knees on the Chrysler or the Honda; you don't have to hunch over to
&gt; &gt;shift gears; your arms aren't spread out wider than your chest when
&gt; &gt;you make a turn; you don't have to move the pedals at an arc opposite
&gt; &gt;the normal travel of your feet; the suspension has more travel than
&gt; &gt;the seat springs....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Are these fightin' words, or what?

What's the point?  All this guy is saying is that Chrysler and Honda 
screwed up a perfectly workable design. :-)  (Ever beaned the front seat 
passenger in the eye with your elbow while parallel parking?)

mine's a parts catalog, not an owner's manual (choost being precise!)

&gt; could help but agree wholeheartedly with your assessment of original old VW
&gt; curtains. Dig that checkered yellow and brown material. Right On!!!!!!
&gt; That stuff is hard to find in good shape. The sun rotted most of those
&gt; curtains out years ago!
&gt; 
More than once I saw a nice looking set of checkered curtains from a 
distance that crumbled in my hands once I got to the hulk.  I finally 
scrounged a pretty complete set, but the only one I used was the 
windshield one for camping.  A previous owner had made a decent set of 
replacements (they were tan :-(.

Tallahassee, Fla.                                      there's no feeling.
