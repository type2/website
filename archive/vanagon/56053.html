Subject: P/S Pump Diagnosis ?

 Our everyday car just packed it in yesterday so I'm in the middle of 
getting the Westy on the road here in the dead of winter :-(
 
 I'm not sure about the health of the p/s pump, however. I had a new 
water pump installed last summer but was still left with a funny sort of 
noise coming from the engine compartment. It's hard to pinpoint.
 
 Grabbing the pulley I can jiggle it straight in and out a fraction of an 
inch. I'm more or less a mechanical neophyte. Is this &quot;play&quot; in the 
pulley a sure sign that the bearing is gone? Hoping this is not the cause 
since it's such an expensive part ( over $500 ).
 
 Should the pulley be very rigid or is a little movement normal?
