&gt; Actually, there is little wrong with the engine, per se (except some

If you want this done, have a shop do it.  You got to pull and strip the 
engine to get to the flaps.  A major pain.  IMHO, this is a repair not 
worth doing, but if you want to or must, definitely shop work.

&gt; but the fuel lines need replacing ($375) 

Easy to do yourself. All the bits are right out in the open.  Lay the 
replacement parts on top of the old parts and unscrew clamps one at a 
time.  Use only new clamps, and rubber. See below for fuel manifold.

&gt; and the brake rotors need replacing (I'm not sure how much this is 
&gt; going to run us).

Also do this yourself.  New rotors (for a '78) were ~50.00 at my FLAPS.  
Yours shouldn't be much more.  Installation is easy, all you need that 
you don't have immediately at hand is the right socket for the calipers, 
and a 1/2&quot; drive bar (both under $25.00 at Sears).  While you are at it, 
do the pads and springs.  Your new rotors will thank you.

&gt; Plus we need a lot of other long term stuff done (front shocks, etc.)

Bad shocks (~$25.00) wear out good tires (~70.00) real fast.
 
&gt; He mentioned a few things that are just expensive because VW parts are such
&gt; a rip-off.  Does anyone think I would have much luck getting the following
&gt; things from a junkyard?
&gt; 
&gt; Driver's side window regulator

Yes, but a knuckle busting bear to get out or in.  Do-able, but ouch!

&gt; Sliding door locking mechanism

If you are very, very lucky.  These break way too often. and are among 
the first things stripped of a bus as it comes thru the gate.

&gt; replacment muffler (can we replace the muffer ourselves or is this a pro job?)

Don't bother, buy new.  You *can* do it, but remember all's fair in love 
and mufflers.  Use the WD-40, use the wrenches, use the hacksaw, use the 
angle grinder, after all it's only 6 nuts, right?   ;-)=

&gt; EGR box

Only VW can sell you one (by law).  I cut the ends off my old one when it 
rusted out and re-fastened the ends to the carb and muffler with a sheet of 
copper flashing sandwiched to seal each end.  No one has noticed yet.

&gt; windsheild (we have two small cracks in ours)

Junkyard for sure! I used to put them in myself (easy, but messy and 
nervous) until I found a local shop that would do it for 25.00.  If not 
found at a junkyard, buy an aftermarket one.  Not only are they cheaper, 
they leak less, IMHO.

&gt; engine cooling flaps

See above.

&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate advice from the wise ones on the net as to which if any
&gt; of these parts will be practical to get from junkyard dealers.
&gt; 

Well, until Joel posts, here's my uninformed opinion. On the cooling 
flaps, exhaust, and fuel manifold, what I did was look for a dead engine 
with all three systems in place, bought the engine, and stripped what I 
needed.  Consider doing the same.  My dead engine cost only $150. YMMV
