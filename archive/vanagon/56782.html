Subject: There is 1966 split window westy for sale near my place

Hi Gang(s),

I called the number on one of the list postings as the forsale vehicle
was listed in Pittsburgh, PA. ...   Alas, I cannot afford it... The
owner is asking $9,000 for it.  I have not asked him how firm this
price is... (I also forgot his pittsburgh, pa number at home, so I'll
have to post it from home tonight)...

As I am told (I have not seen this vehicle yet), it is:

1966 Westy 
original paint (white) no rust, in storage for many years.
(supposedly) no dents
engine in working condition, needs seals.
The owner claims it is in pristine condition....


I cannot afford this thing (darn, those kids cost you a lot on money!)
but if anyone wants me to be their eyes and ears (assuming the engine
still works) and hands (I am a mediocre mechanic), I'll go see it  for
you... 


This person apparently lives in Florida, but is here for the weekend,
so if you want me to see  it, let me know fast (send me a list of
things you want checked -- I do not have a compression tester, so,
assuming the engine works, it'll have to be checked by pulling spark
plug wires...)


usual disclaimers apply....
