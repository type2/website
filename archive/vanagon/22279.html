 &gt; I piddled around Sunday, replacing broken studs and soldering hokey wiring.

Am I the only one who thinks soldering wires in a vehicle is a bad idea?

At least the FAA agrees with me: in the document &quot;Acceptable Methods, 
Techniques and Practices: Aircraft Inspection, Repair and Alterations&quot; they 
say (of splicing wires) 

	&quot;Solder splices may be used; however they are particularly brittle and 
        not recommended&quot; (AC 43.13-1A par 445)

and
	&quot;The solder process has disadvantages that have been overcome by the use of
        solderless terminals.  A few of these disadvantages are listed as 
follows:
            (1) A more skilled operator is required.
            (2) A corrosive flux may be used causing the joint to deteriorate.
            (3) Maintenance is extremely difficult.
            (4) The wire strands are stiffened by the solder and become more 
                susceptible to breakage due to vibration.
            (5) the wire insulation may be charred during the soldering 
process.&quot;
         (AC 43.13-1A par 450a)

Furthermore, it seems that high vibration (like in an airplane or the engine 
bay of a van) can cause soldered wires to crack, developing areas of high 
resistance that can heat due to current flow and melt the solder, further 
exacerbating the problem.  In the worst case, aa fire can result.

Me, I always use aircraft-grade crimp splices both in my airplane and all my 
ground vehicles.

(this document, BTW, is a great source of info like how to size wires, the 
right way to wrap wire bundles, how to repair fuel tanks, and on and on.  You 
can get it from the Government Printing Office or most of the little pilot 
shops at your local airport)
