Subject: Heat exchangers

When I bought my Camper the heating system was totally dismantled.  
There was no blower or ducts leading to those two big torpedo shaped 
boxes in front of the engine on both sides.  I was told that you 
really don't want to have an exhaust leak anywhere near the place 
where the exchangers bolt to the heads.  My exchangers were scetchy 
so I removed them to see if there were any exhaust leaks(I am also 
rebuilding my engine). To make sure there were no holes I removed the 
tinware on the outside of the exchangers.  There were no holes! Since 
I have no heating system, do I need to put the tinware back on? Will 
the lack of tinware cause the engine compartment to be hotter than if 
it had tinware? Thanks in advance.

Aaron
