Subject:       83 Waterboxer for Sale

I have an 83 4 speed Waterboxer for Sale.  The Van has a new paint 
job - original colors - brown and tan.  The van was completely 
stripped, sanded, primed, and repainted.  We removed everything 
except the windows, and door handles for the painting.  We pinstriped 
the van along the tan paint lines/

The interior is original and is like new.  

Mechanical - has new brakes and muffler.  Clutch, pressure plate, 
throwout bearing and trans main seal replaced about 20K ago.

I've owned the van since new and have kept up the maintenance on it.  
The only work on the van was by VW dealers or by myself.  Van has 
suffered only minor scrapes and door dings.  Van has not been in an 
accident.

Van is in Starkville, Mississippi.  Work phone number is (601) 
325-1908.  Home is (601) 324-1739.
