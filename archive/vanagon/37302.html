&gt;Hi all,
&gt;	I would like to put a set of 27 x 8.5 14 BFG All-Terrain tires on 
&gt;my '86 Westy.  FLTS says this is completely ok, yet it has not been 
&gt;presented on the list(at least to my knowledge). Is there something that 
&gt;the FLTS is failing to consider?  Thanks to one and all...

They will fit with no problem.  Ride some what harsh and noisey due to
agressive tread patterns used on this size tire.  Why are you looking to use
this size?   I know people that use this tire on thier syncros with great
results for off road applications.  I would not choose this tire if most of
my driving is long high speed trips.  A good touring or performance tire
would be much better.  I run 215/70's.
