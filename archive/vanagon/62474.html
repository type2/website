&gt;Does anyone know where to get parts and info on the Auto Stop 80% fill
&gt;valve on Westy campers?  I think all I need is a diaphragm because when
&gt;it the tank was filled and the valve shut off I had a gas leak out of
&gt;the weep hole (vent hole) on the brass casing of the auto stop valve
&gt;that would not stop.  My van by the way is a 1989 if that makes a
&gt;difference.
&gt;
&gt;Are these things pretty reliable, or are they a constant headache?  If
&gt;Auto Stop parts are no longer available, I would appreciate any
&gt;alternatives to get the system up and operational again.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks as always to the members of the list that make this such a great
&gt;resource.

Peter,
About 7 years ago, I went through the same thing. I replaced it with a
generic 2 stage regulator. It's been fine ever since.
