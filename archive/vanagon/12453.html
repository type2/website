This one's for cheeseheads in Wisconsin......
BEERGUTNUGEN
Works for me. I made an exact replica of the static cling types that VW 
sent out about 5 years ago. I imaged them on a Gerber  Edge imager and 
replaced the steering wheel that dude is holding with a beer mug. Then I 
made a beergut on the guy. Gets the laughs around Milwaukee hey! :)
