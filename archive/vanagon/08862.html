other matters.....please bring--among all else--the following:

keys to your water tanks (so that you can open mine)
firewood
LOTS of quarters for the showers
your reservations/tickets to get in the campground
folding chairs
tarps/raingear
camera
ghost stories and sheet music
lanterns/flashlights
charcoal
matches
food, especially for our fishchowder gourmet dinner delux

MOST importantly = at the pizza gathering, we discovered that a lot of
list members are musically inclined, and there's rumor of a down-and-out
hootenany.  Bring your guitars, harmonicas, banjos, basses, grand pianos,
whatever (just please spare me beginning violin and any level saxophone  :).
Bring your vast knowledge of music from the summer of love, your screeching
vibratos, and let's recreate history!
