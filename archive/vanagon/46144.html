Subject: Sticky lifters don't help Vanagon sales! (f)

Sunday AM ran out to investigate the previously meantioned Syncro source. In
my absence an unexpected potential buyer for the '81 Vanagon came by. My
wife said that she could tell that it wasn't a great match when the fella
could hardly get out of the car in which he arrived. &quot;Orthoscopic surgery on
the knee,&quot; the guy said as he tried to hike himself up into the bus. Of
course, the bus had been sitting for two weeks on a slight sideways incline
w/o being started. The fella fired up the van. It started right up. VROOOM,
RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT etc. as white smoke momentarily poured out the back. Dang,
the lifter is sticking again. VROOOM, RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! Paula said that the
couple drove the van down the street and stopped. Went a little further and
stopped again. With two quick left turns, the folks came back, returned the
key and could hardly leave fast enough. &quot;It has a nice body.&quot; was the
comment over the shoulder as they just about screamed out of sight.
Somehow, when I tried to kid my wife straight faced about me spending money
(that we dont have) on a Syncro that morning didn't go over too well. I made
a deal with her that I woulnd buy a Synchro if she didnt go off on me about
selling the '81. Honestly I'm trying to sell this one. Good deal for someone
willing to put a clutch in it. Silly people just expect vehicles to work
like they were meant to. Hmmm...
