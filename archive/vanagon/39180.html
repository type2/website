Subject: Census concensus

 I've been told that Joel Walker is taking care of the census. I do want to
point out that the state is included (as per weekly statz), I wouldn't know
the location of the township of the listee nor the availability of parts or
the request for the same.

 In order to make a database that would be beneficial to all, as far as
travelling and knowing that there is someone &quot;familiar&quot; in the area, the
township would be needed, as well as the e-mail address and perhaps a phone.
Of course, the phone is optional at this point in time and basically only
needed at the time of travel.

 As far as the parts is concerned, I would need who has them and who needs
them. Having the area, one can already expect what to pay for all, parts and
s/h.

 And please, don't flame me for trying to do a service that would benefit
all. Mr. Walker is doing a great job which was not required but great for
stats and knowledge (various reasons). Obviously, some do feel that what I'm
trying to do is to their liking.

 I will rephrase the original content to: anyone that wants to be in a list
that I will compile for the purposes of knowing your geographical location,
e-mail address, parts needed, parts wanted, year and model of vehicle and a
probable need for a phone number, just send me e-mail with a subject of
&quot;census&quot; (no quotes) with your city, state, country and anything else that
you feel I need.

 As I compile the information, I will e-mail only to the ones that have sent
such messages in order to keep the list clutter free and save bandwidth.
Fair enough?
