Subject: Re: Vanagon needs new tires

Tires seem to be a HOT topic!

Just talked to the Tire Rack -

They have only ONE reinforced tire available in the 205/70 R14 size:

Michelin MXT for $91 each (even though these are not shown on their pages)

They also have some XCH4 tires available not the 205, but a 185 width at $84
They also have an MX 'reinforced' tire in the 185 width for $65.

Some of the LT tires look interesting. The LTX M/S in a P205/75 SR14 is $78,
but today's guy said that this is not a 'reinforced' tire and would not be
strong enough for the Vanagon. (My how the info remains confusing!)

Harvey - who told you that these were the replacement for the XCH4's? It does
seem that you think this tire is fine? Yet the TireRack guy says &quot;they aren't
strong enough for the Vanagon.&quot;

???????????????????????????????? mount and repeat themselves. 
Who really knows the truth!

&gt; Subject says it all -  currently runnin a set of  Michelin XCH4  LT195/75 R
&gt; 14 tires that have given really good service (in excess of 60 K miles). 
&gt; Find out that these are discontinued, the replacement by Michelin is called
&gt; LTX and $90 each!.  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Harvey
