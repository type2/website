Subject: Re: FS - Rear Mud Flaps

     Apologies in advance if I'm taking up too much bandwidth.  I'm a bit 
     embarassed to turn this into an &quot;auction&quot;, but I don't want anyone to 
     be goin', &quot;Oh, man!!&quot;
     
     I have an offer from a list member of $100 for the pair of new OEM 
     rear flaps.  If anyone has a mind to top this offer, let me know 
     before noon, Monday.
