&gt;I'm a Wanabuser, but don't want to be.  I'm not in any particular
&gt;hurry so I've been just keeping my eyes open for buses in that
&gt;narrow range (given my financial state) between too rusty and
&gt;too expensive.  Not much in that niche, here in Michigan.

want a 1978 bus camper for $2500? :)  but it has an automatic transmission.
anyway, it's in the papers right now. i've not gone and looked at it ...
but i can if anyone wants me to. go ahead: twist my arm. ;)

&gt;My question is, he says to check the differential and brakes
&gt;this way:  jack up one side of the car, block the
&gt;other wheels, and run the car through all gears (this is on page 25 of
&gt;my &quot;15th&quot; edition), is this possible?  Won't the other rear
&gt;wheel try to rotate too, with dangerous results?  Has anyone
&gt;done this test?

uhhhhhhhh ... well, from past experience in mud and snow, it WILL spin the
loose wheel. but i think it's a bad idea, from a safety point of view.
why not just take the thing out and drive it? that way you get to 'feel'
the suspension and steering as well.
