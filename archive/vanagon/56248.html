Subject: AFM Repair?

I took a look inside the AirFlow Box on my 84 Westy.  Indeed, the wiper arm was
dirty and the track was worn through.  I cleaned it up as best I could, but I
find myself wondering if there is anyway to restore the carbon track that the
wiper arm contacts.  I called a local electronic parts place, but they weren't
any help.  Anybody know of a paint-on carbon material that could be used to
renovate a variable resistor track?  Seems like it ought to be possible...
