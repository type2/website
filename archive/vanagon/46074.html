Subject: what's the extra battery for?

In the recently purchased '87 westy multivan wolfsburg edition, I 
discovered a VW battery with a white plastic case.  It has wires running 
to it, but I don't know where they go.  I know that some campers in some 
years had dual battery setups though I don't know specifically which 
appliances the second battery was designed to power other than the fridge 
and perhaps the light in the back.  But, my vanagon does not have these 
appliances, and I believe that it never did.  The previous owner told me 
that he understands that the first owner owned a VW dealership and 
special ordered the multivan from germany.  It is missing the seat behind 
the passenger seat, but there are 2 bolts sticking out of the floor.
Also, there's a cigarette lighter outlet below the passenger seat on the 
side.  Is this something that anyone's heard of before as an option?

If anyone has any insight into these questions, I'd appreciate it.  I'd 
like to be able to use one of those coolers that plugs into the cigarette 
lighter, and it would be espcially nice if I had extra juice to work 
with.  I'd still like to know what's going on.  

Thanks

david
