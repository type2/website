&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I went by the BMW and Mercedes dealerships and asked to see the 
&gt; antifreeze they sell.  Today I stopped by NAPA and it turns out it is 
&gt; the exact same product.  The rear label of the NAPA jug claims that the 
&gt; product is the same one as the _factory fill_ for Porsche, BMW, Mercedes 
&gt; and other cars(do not remember more brands).  A call to the 800 number in 
&gt; the back of the jug put me in touch with the Lab Director of Automotive 
&gt; Chemicals of Ashland Oil, a subsidiary of which is Valvoline which in 
&gt; turn produces this antifreeze.  The director assured me that the 
&gt; antifreeze is most definitely phosphate-free.  
&gt; 
&gt; At $5.40/gal at NAPA, the price is a third of what the Autobahn stuff goes 
&gt; for at VW/Porsche/Audi dealers or what Volvo charges for their version of 
&gt; phosphate-free antifreeze and still cheaper than what Mercedes/BMW charge 
&gt; for the exact same product.  As a result, the obvious question is: has 
&gt; anyone used this product and were the experiences good or bad?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much. I will summarize any responses which are not mailed to 
&gt; the list.
