Subject: gas milage on a 75 fuely

this new bus i have does not seem to be getting good gas milage.  what do 
the rest of you out there get with your?  mine is a stock fi 1800cc motor 
with a full auto trans.  it is a westy so i know that it weighs more, but 
8-10 mpg, something is wrong.  it is still stalling when cold, so this 
may be part of it, but right now i have no time to track it down.  how 
about the rest of you?  what kind of milage shoult i get?

thanks and God Bless
matt
