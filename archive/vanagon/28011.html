Howdy!

Finally picked up the two rebuilt 2 liter heads from the machine shop, as
well as the rehoned, painted barrels and cleaned pistons. Also bought a
gasket set, tin screws, sealant, and a new set of piston rings. Total
cost: about $580!

Also got the old, cracked, and non-rebuildable head back and checked the
casting number: 022 xxx xxx. So it, too, was a 2 liter head and that means
that this previously rebuilt (by VW of Canada) engine came with a 2 liter
block, 2 liter p/c and 2 liter heads; everything else (crank, rods,
camshaft, lifters) came out of a 1800.

Two problems so far and perhaps someone can help :-) 

(1) I thoroughly cleaned one of piston/barrel sets, installed the rings
(carefully following the procedures), oiled the inside of the barrels, the
pistons and the rings, compressed the rings and slid the piston into the
barrel, this last step being much more delicate and time consuming than
one would guess from reading the books. In short, I believe I did
everything correctly. Nevertheless, there seems to be much friction
between the cylinders and the pistons, *much* more than when I took them
apart three weeks ago. In fact, I have to stand up and push hard for there
to be any movement. Is this normal? 

(2) Neither head has the drilled/tapped hole for the FI head temperature
sensor, at least not one like the old head had. So I call the machine shop
and tell them they gave me two right heads, but he replies that on the
newer 2 liter heads (as opposed to the *older 2 liter* heads &lt;?!&gt;), this
hole is at a different location. In fact, the sensor goes where,
previously there was a tin screw, right by the intake manifold. Indeed,
one of those holes is larger; however, my old temp sensor still doesn't
fit. Question: is there a slightly smaller CHT sensor out there, perhaps
one that was designed to work at this different and probably slightly
cooler location? 

Merci!
