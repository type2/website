Subject: '78 bus for $100??

Ok, here's the deal.  I've had my '79 westy since July and it has been 
running fine (7000 kilometers so far).  A few weeks ago, I went to 
someone's house to check out a used clothes dryer which I didn't buy.  
However, a '78 bus with A.C. was parked out front without tags.  I asked 
the people in the house about it, and they told me that this guy left it 
there a couple of months before.  I won't go into the details of this 
story, but the guy who had it briefly insisted he was a mechanic and that 
he wasn't sure if the bus was a '73 or '75 or if it still runs.  I talked to 
this guy a 
couple of times on the phone, and he sounded as f***ed up as his previous 
housemates had described......pretty friendly though.  In the meantime, I 
took the horn off the '78 so my bus would pass inspection.  

Anyway, I don't think I've been on this list long enough to consider 
owning two busses simultaneously, but it seems like a '78 would make one 
great spare part.  I already own two cars, so I thought I should ask the 
list if I should seek help before I purchase a third.  The actual owner 
lives an hour away and hasn't seen the bus for 1 1/2 years.  She has the 
title and was wondering what had happened to it, but she only wants what 
she says the junkyard will give her - $100.  Sending it there seems like 
a sad ending.  Should I buy it and become personally responsible for a 
third vehicle?? Anybody want some parts if I get it??
