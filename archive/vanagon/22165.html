Subject: Fids



To All:

Got something that needs plugging but ain't got a cork handy?  Use a fid.

Properly, a fid is a cylindrical wedge.  You use them when you're splicing
line.  But since fids are nothing more than tapered hardwood cones (steel,
for steel cable), they come in handy for plugging holes, although softwood
generally makes a better plug, hardwood a better fid.

The point of a sharp pencil is a miniture fid.  Think big.  You can whittle
the things but if you've got a drill press, you can turn them; think of it as
a vertical lathe.  To turn a taper you simply hold the piece so the axis is a
little off center.  A nail in a board will do for the bottom center, a screw
or spade-bit in the chuck will serve as the upper center.  You need the screw
or spade because you've got to impart rotary motion to the wood.

Such an arrangement will only work for small stuff.  And don't try to make
them too long; six inches is plenty.  Start with a piece of 3/4&quot; square pine
or cedar, plan on making a taper from about 5/8&quot; to 1/4&quot;.  That is, the lower
center should be offset about 1/4&quot;.  Coarse sand paper -- #80 or worse --
will serve as your cutter.  Keep the speed low; just try it out.

If the lower center is nice and sturdy you won't have any trouble making an
even taper; the thing will look like a little carrot when you get done.  Make
a few of them then try a couple with a larger diameter.

If the taper is nice and long, the things make perfect plugs for hoses and
the like.  If you need a good seal, dip the things in hot wax to seal up the
wood, or give them a coat of paint.  Keep a couple of each size in your kit,
you'll be surprised at how handy they are.  Once you've got something plugged
you can cut off the surplus length and secure it with bailing wire for a
more-or-less permanent plug.

Wood is handy stuff.  If you turn a very slight taper, you can even thread
such a plug into a threaded hole and have the threads hold the thing, just
like a bolt.  The threads won't take much pressure, of course, but they will
make a tight seal.  And you can always rig something to provide pressue to
keep it in the hole.

I suppose such things are more common around boats but I've found them to
come in handy in the middle of a desert, when the only boat in sight said
'Volkswagen' on the hatch.
