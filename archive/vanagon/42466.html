&gt;My wife told me that the coolant level light would come on at odd times on
&gt;our 85 vanagon.  The level was OK but I changed out the tank sender anyway.
&gt;No improvement.  I asked around and a couple of VW places questioned if the
&gt;85 actually has a relay for the coolant level light.  &quot;Did'nt that start in
&gt;86?&quot;
&gt;they would say.  Also some thought it was the voltage requlator that was
bad.
&gt;I found a book which lists all the relays for 80-85 Vanagons and there was
&gt;the relay listing.  But where is the mounting location?  It was'nt right
&gt;above the fuse block.  i spent about 30 minutes paging through the Bentley
&gt;manual and came upon a picture an air duct hose which had a relay near it.
&gt;I reached under the dash board and put my hand on top of the driver side air
&gt;duct and felt two small boxes.  I wiggled one loose and it was the coolant
&gt;level relay.  I replaced it and the light only comes on a start up.

Light coming on at strange times could be indication of combustion gases
getting into cooling system.  When light comes on, check level without
shutting of engine.  Combustion gases in the system will push the coolant out
of expansion bottle,(hoses balloon to make room),  causing the sensor to
become uncovered turning the light on.
