&gt;I posted something in the last few days to the list about the cabinet lights
&gt;I installed in my '81 westy.  They were from Camping World, and one of our
&gt;list memebers in Switzerland, Darie Duclos (darie_at_hasler.ascom.ch) would like
&gt;the address, and their 800 number is not reachable from out of the country.  I
&gt;thought I could lay my hands on the address, but wasn't able to find it today.
&gt;Does anyone have their address handy?  I guess it should be the catalog
&gt;ordering address, so that a catalog can be requested.

Camping World                     mostly geared toward Winnebago-buses,
Three Springs Road                but lots of little 'stuff' that might
P. O. Box 90017                   be useful to mini-busers.
