&lt;&lt; They never brought Kombis
 or Panels to the US, &gt;&gt;

the '80 Vanagon that I took the front rubber Cab floor mat out of was:
solid in color-
had masonite sidepanels-
had a headliner only over the cab area-
had a &quot;deep dished&quot; steering wheel typical of all V-gon commercials-
had a open parcel tray instead of a glovebox-
had no clock-
had black steel bumpers w/ no trim strips-
had no dash blower fan-
had fixed side windows-

and it was a US model, badged as a &quot;Vanagon&quot; on the back hatch.

seemed like a Kombi to me....
