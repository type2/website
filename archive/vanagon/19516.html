Subject: Help me with this Vanagon

I am going to look at a Vanagon tomorrow night.  I need some advice from
some of you Vanagon owners.  It is a 1990 burgundy GL model with power
windows, power locks, cruise control and &quot;rear AC&quot;.  It is at a used car
dealer :(
The photo shows it to be one of the models that looks lowered, and it sits
on alloy wheels.  They said it was Burgundy, manual transmission (been
seeing a lot of automatics), and drives nice.  The price is $7999
I really appreciate the input I've gotten in such a short time since I
posted my inquiry to broken slider door handles.
What should this bus be worth?  What should I look for and prepare to use at
the bargaining table?  I'm going to dump both my rabbit 4 door and rabbit
convertible in their lap in part trade (If I like it that is).
Thanks in advance for any help...
