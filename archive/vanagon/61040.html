Actually, the flame sensor is not the problem.  Using either A/C or D/C before 
lighting the fridge helps by warming up the chimney which gets the draft 
started.  Lack of air is the real reason these things are hard to start.  That 
little hand air pump may also not be working. Check the little check valve for 
it,(have to remove fridge).  That little ball will often get stuck rendering 
the pump useless.

Here's a couple of things I've noticed.   If you want to start the critter
on gas you'll have to consider the thoughts going on with the flame sensor
that tells the propane valve not to shut off.  

If you pre-heat the system by running on DC for a little bit you may find
that the lighting goes a bit easier as the flame sensor gets a little 
advantage on his eternal question &quot;How hot is it?&quot;.  Try it, it might work
for you like it does for me.
