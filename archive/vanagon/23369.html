Subject: CHERRY '78 CAMPMOBILE DELUXE FOR SALE

Hi Gerry -- 

I'm new at this internet thing,  so forgive me if this isn't the right way to
go about posting this:

1978 VW Campmobile Deluxe:  90% MUSEUM-QUAILTY!  66K on original engine,
stored in heated garage.  Original paint in showroom condition!
 Refridgerator, stove and pop-up in like-new condition.  ONE-OF-A-KIND!!

Cosmetic deficiencies:  slight dent on sliding door &amp; headliner over driver
seat separating from panel.  That's it.  Other than that, it's PERFECT!

Asking $9500.
