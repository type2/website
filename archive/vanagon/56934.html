Subject: Ground Shut-off Switch Needed

Hi All:

I am looking for a simple but effective ground shut-off or disconnect
switch for my '83 Vanagon. There is not enough room in the battery
compartment for an available terminal post screw switch, plus I don't
want to be opening and closing the cover all the time. 

Does anybody know of a pull-plug key or other external disconnect? (I
seem to remember reading about a VW hot-rod modification for a
plastic/metal remote ground connection with a big key, but that was a
few years ago)

Please reply to the list

TIA
