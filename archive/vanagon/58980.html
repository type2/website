&gt; Regarding the sighting of a Vanagon in a Iomega ad in Newsweek, I was
&gt; wondering if the person who posted the info could tell me what the date of
&gt; that issue was, and what was on the cover.  I receive a subscription to
&gt; Newsweek and would like to see the ad myself.

Chris,
That was me who sighted it.  I forget the date but it was the most
recent issue with Colin Powell on the cover.  I think it was page 15 or
something.

In retrospect, I can see why they wanted a Vanagon for the ad, they
needed something where they could get right up close to the driver for a
photograph :-)
