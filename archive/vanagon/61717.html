Subject: Re: ac water got no exit!

The ac drain tubes getting 'sealed' at the bottom is quite common in
many types of cars.  They can be just 'clogged' or could have melted
shut.  The dealer snipped the ends off for me no charge (mines really a
good one), but you should be able to do it yourself if need be.
