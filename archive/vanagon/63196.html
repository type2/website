I once saw a set up that a fellow westi owner had on his roof for boats.

It was a custom made rack, but it allowed him to have his boats on the
rack, when it came time to pop the top, the rack allowed him to pivot the
sub rack 90 degrees to a vertical on the drivers side so he didn't have to
unload the water craft each night, I thought this was pretty cool but
didn't take a really good look at the details.

His front bar was attached to the rain gutters, ahead of the pop top, his
rear bar was almost at the end of the van, it was always high enough to
clear the pop top (when popped up)

I saw him with 2 kayaks on the rack and it just took a second to get them
out of the way, pretty slick!!!!

Regarding driving in the wind...... get good tires, the 4 ply side wall at
least, 6 ply if you want the van to be really solid, maybe a bit
noisier(tire noise) but well worth the stability, when I got my van the
tires were OK tread, but passenger tires when I got on the highway with a
cross wind it felt like I was driving on soggy donuts, unless you have the
extra ply sidewalls the tire will roll under, ask my wife she had a blowout
on her way to the lake last year, only to have a car pull over with a
fellow westi owner in it(near Banff Alberta), knowing all the tricks to
changing the tire, A big thanks to anyone out there if you have told this
story to your list buddies, it was my wife!
