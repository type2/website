Subject: Re: Starter Solonoid Blues


&gt;I finally broke down and installed a second relay for my '77 westy
&gt;starter.  The problem is, the windings on the magnet get hot, and the
&gt;resistance in the wires goes up enough that it won't fire.  The solution
&gt;is to circumvent the long resistance path of the wires to the key and
&gt;back using a small relay that juices the solinoid directly from the
&gt;battery.  This bizzare fix worked for me, I can now drive long distance
&gt;all day and she always starts.  Good luck.


One of the rare instances where Ford really did have a better idea--
all their cars are this way. Not bizarre at all, if you think about it.
It makes sense, and works!
