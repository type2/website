In a message dated 97-05-02 13:31:12 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; &gt;&lt;&lt; 72 VOLKSWAGEN WEST CELLER VAN, new paint, no rust, good cond,
 &gt; $1500. (718) 471-1216  Belle Harbor  &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;HA HA HA HA !!!!!!!!!!!  :&lt;)
 &gt;
 &gt;THAT'S THE BEST ONE YET!!!!!  :&lt;)
 
 Maybe it has a cellular phone installed--or perhaps they used it as a wine
 cellar--Or they used it to confine prisoners...
 
 Or the celler himself could just be a friggin moron... 
 
 &gt;&gt;

Hmmm.... I'll have to agree with the latter...  :&lt;)
Maybe he and the guy with the split window Vanagon are brothers???  :&lt;)
