I thought the same when I received the first one, but the floor of the
walkthru is on a slight incline (the bottom of it being at the rear), the
console's bottom itself is cut to take advantage of it.  I've never had one
slide all over the place forwards or backwards, even under hard braking or
acceleration.  However, I would agree to a point if one was in a extreme
situation of braking, it might move and in an accident, it would difinetly
move around.  I put one of these in a 73 Panel Bus (mounted on the OE Rubber
Pad) and currently have one in my 67 Deluxe 21 Window (mounted on Carpet).
