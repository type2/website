&gt; Jonny Miner writes, continuing the saga of dragging brakes:

&gt; I posted a few weeks ago about my brakes, recieved some tips, followed 
&gt; some advice, and they're still dragging! :-( I've replaced the master 
&gt; cylinder and both rear wheel cylinders with new brazillian parts and my 
&gt; rear brakes still drag. If I adjust the shoes (via the adjusting stars) 
&gt; away from the drums, they work fine for a few miles and then start 
&gt; dragging again. The return springs appear fine, although I have not 
&gt; replaced them (this would require endless scrounging through a junkyard). 
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas? 
&gt;

  Have the shoes been replaced? Are they contaminated with brake fluid or 
  reduction gear oil? If they are clean and dry, the next place I would
  look is for rusted/seized emergency brake cables and linkage. If that stuff
  is not working as it should it may give your bus a continuously variable 
  brake adjustment.

  Don't give up, there has to be an explanation somewhere....
