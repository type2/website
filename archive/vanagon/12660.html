Gerry,

For the most part there was apparently a redesign of the post '85 head/cylinder 
mating surface (I've heard through reliable sources) that significantly reduced 
the instance of head gasket failures.  Obviously, there are some careful owners 
such as yourself, who, through thoughtful care and routine preventative 
maintenance, have done much better (this is really a &quot;hats off&quot; to you) with 
their pre '86 engines....

What do you base this on?  Let's see an '86 beast is 9 years old. That 
makes an '85 the magic 10 years, doesn't it?  So, unless you have some 
real statistics for the '83-'85 motors... I'm curious what you base that 
on.  My '84 has over 155,000 miles and climbing ( I know, it's anecdotal).

Are there any good statistics on the life of a VW Water-cooled HO 4-bnager?
