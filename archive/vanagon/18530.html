&gt; Howcome the past day or so all of the vanagon posts are comming thru
&gt; to me without the usual &quot;vanagon&quot; address, but the addresses of the
&gt; original poster? Just curious...while sifting thru my list.

Pay attention, Ric. &lt;grin&gt; 

As I posted to the list in a message titled &quot;Administrative changes&quot;, I've
changed the list so the default for replies will be to the original
poster.  To send to the list, you'll need to reply to all. 

Quiz tomorrow.
