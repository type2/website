Subject: happy camper story


In response to John Huguenard's happy story about fixing
his FI system, I thought I'd relate a similar story.

The weekend before I was to take my '76 Bus to Charlotte
(850 miles round trip), it started running on 3 cylinders.
When it first happened, I pulled over and checked things
out.  I didn't see any loose hoses or wires.  I immediately
suspected the spark plug wires so I wiggled all of them.
The plug wire on #3 was a bit loose so I figured that was
my problem.  When I got home I went out and got a brand new
set of Bosch plug wires, and figured what the hell, and got
Bosch plugs, cap &amp; rotor at the same time.  In the dwindling
light at about 9PM I made the swaps.  I took it for a brief
test-drive and it ran great.  Problem solved.

Except... the next morning, it was acting just the same.
Running on 3 cylinders, though a few times it would return
to full power for a few seconds, as if there was a loose
wire somewhere.  I had to drive it to work so I thought
about what else it could be.  Obviously it was an electrical
problem of some kind.  It was running on 3 cylinders, but
there were no backfires or smell of gas anywhere, so it was
as if gas wasn't getting to the cylinder...

That night I un-plugged the connectors for all of the fuel
injectors and looked at them.  Sure enough, the plug for #2
injector was messed up.  There are two metal connectors
inside the plug, and somehow the little tab that held one
of them in place was flattened and the connector was
recessed in the plug.  I pushed it through, bent out the
little tab with my Swiss Army knife, plugged it back in,
and viola, problem solved.

The next day I drove to Charlotte at 72MPH at 20.2 MPG.
What's the moral of the story?  When your FI system acts
up, don't throw money at it, you can fix it yourself!
