By the same token, I woulnd't buy tires that do not inflate to the 
pressure recommended on the door frame.  I have a problem now, however, 
because the tires I just bought have a max of 50 lbs, and the recommended 
is 48.  Is that cutting it close, or is it ok?  With bicycle tires, I 
could always inflate to exactly the maximum pressure and it'd be fine. Is 
this true of Automobile tires also?
