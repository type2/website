&gt;I have a partially stripped drain plug in my 87 westy.  I had the local shop
&gt;install a helicoil but it still drips.  Apparantly a helicoil is something
&gt;that retreads the old drain plub but it didn't work in my case.  Anyway I've
&gt;heard talk of &quot;expansion bolts.&quot;  My mechanic doesn't like them, says I
&gt;should live with the drip.  Any ideas or sources for an expansion plug.  I
&gt;doubt I'm alone in this problem.
I went to the local FLAPS and bought a rubber plug, (1/2 inch if I 
remember).
I had to hacksaw the collar/head of the plug, since it didn't fit into 
the (slightly) recessed hole of the '87 Vanagon.
12K miles and no leaks (with Mobil One synthetic, no less).
I intend to call Helicoil and get that kit myself to put in a proper 
threaded hole.
I think it's about $70, not sure.
