Subject: Barndoor Page Update

        Ok,

        I've added some more cool pix to the barndoor page:

        A picture of Eric S's piano-hinge vent-wing- '52 and earlier-only
bit, something you don't see very often, if at all

        Pix of David Glass's 53 single cab, complete with smooth side gates
- later pickup side gates had the stamping in them
        
        Pic of Mike Parker's '53 standard

        The VW Bus Hall of Shame page is still on the way!
