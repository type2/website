Subject: Back and ready to go! (On GNATT)

I'm back from Bus-Heaven-O-Rama, AKA northern California.  I don't think
I've ever seen so many Busses in my life.  Some of them were even as ratty
as mine :)

Anyway, as some of you may recall, I'm planning a bunch of work on the Frau
this summer--paint, body repairs, etc.  One of the places needing repair
(again) is the metal around the windshield.  It's been looking rusty for
spell (OK, a long spell) but yesterday, while washing the windshield at the
gas station, I leaned on the rubber seal &amp; the metal (more accurately, the
former metal) buckled.  There's now a big hole.  I find this a bad sign.
Has anybody fiberglassed bad damage like this?  I'm probably going to have a
shop do the work (time is a factor, time and not having a garage or barn
anymore) but I'd be curious as to whether or not anybody's been in this boat
before and how they took care of such serious damage.  I had the seal/rust
fixed a few years ago (fiberglass) and haven't been pleased with the way it
lasted.  I've not seen any sheet-metal replacement inserts for the bottom of
the 'shield.  Advice?
