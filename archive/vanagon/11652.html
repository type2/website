By the way folks, for the side markers (red lenses near the rear) 
although the bulbs from blinkys (amber lenses on construction signs,
you know, the things you steal for your friends apartment when you're
wandering around drunk in the middle of the night.) will fit but can not
handle the amperage, you have to buy the right bulb.
But... considering that they are supposed to run on 6 V and the side marker
circuit is 12 V...  Couldn't you just wire them in series instead of 
parallel...
SStones is contemplating making too much work for himself...
Although it would be nice considering that every construction site
offers many of these bulbs for free.   :)
