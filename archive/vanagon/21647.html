Subject: (U)Windshield replacement

I recall years ago that San Bernadino Glass put out a very helpful write-up on
how to replace the bus/bug windshield. As I recall, after attacking the rubber
seal with a sharp instrument, the idea is to separate the glass from the
remaining rubber as carefully as possible. Use a piece of heavy duty string
poked through the seal next to the glass and with the help of an assistant in
or outside of the bus use a sawing motion to affect the &quot;careful separation of
glass from rubber&quot; all along the outside edge of the glass until the glass is
completely free. Of course, support of the glass is paramount toward the end of
this operation. The string comes in handy on the reverse operation of install-
ation of rubber/glass to cause the lip of the rubber seal to pop over the
metal frame. Of course this is all in the write-up which I saw several years
ago, maybe someone has a copy of it?
