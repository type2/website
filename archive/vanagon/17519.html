Subject: Double-Cab Pickup

Read an interesting one in the Sunday edition.  There is apparently a 
race between Ford and GM to be the first with a long-cab pickup boasting 
a third door for easy access to passenger and cargo space behind the 
front seat.  Both say those will go into production late this year...

Flashback to Volkswagen circa 1957... deja vu!  And Chrysler still claims 
to have invented the minivan.  Sheesh, even Subaru had 'em beat on that 
one.  We Volksfolks are sooo far ahead of our time. =)
