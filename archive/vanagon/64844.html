Subject:      VW  TENT FOR SALE

Came across a woman who still has the tent that came with her 83.5
Vanagon Westy.  Van is gone, tent remained behind.
Took it out of the bag for maybe the first time:  looks like it has
never been used.  Not even a blade of grass inside.
If interested, please email.
TBill
