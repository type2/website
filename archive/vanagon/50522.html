Let me share everything I know about this conversion.
=0D
First, the only conversions I have seen to date are replacements of diese=
l
engines in Vanagons with  Golf/Jetta GTI/GLI engines.  I have seen two,
talked with the owners, and both were very happy with the conversions.
Several items I noted from this conversion.  The transmission used with t=
he
diesel engine is too low geared for use with the gas engines, so the tran=
s
from a gas Vanagon should be used.  You need to retain the bell housing f=
rom
the diesel transmission though.  The oil pan, dip stick, oil pump,flywhee=
l,
clutch, exaust, must be moved from the diesel to the gas engine.  The fue=
l
injection system was taken (in one case) from an 82-84 Rabbit.  This is a=

relatively simple system with no computer.  Some fabrication work needs t=
o be
done to make the intake and fuel distributor/air cleaner hook up.  I beli=
eve
that in one case, pieces from a
Toyota were used.  One owner apparently had the cold start injector hooke=
d up
to be used normally.  The other has a switch on the dash that activated t=
he
injector when needed.  Both claimed that the vehicle would go faster that=
 was
considered safe, got excellant gas mileage (mid 20s and more), and was
extremely reliable.  Weight difference should be negligible.
=0D
The conversion I would like to do is move the parts listed above from the=

diesel engine, plus the motor mounts, splash pans, accelerator cable, fro=
m
the diesel Vanagon, over to a gas Vanagon.  I assume that all the parts w=
ill
fit.  Its just a matter of coming to terms with the differences between t=
he
diesel and gas Vanagons.  Some differences are location of the battery,
location of coolant tank, fuel tank connections and fuel pump/filter, etc=
=2E  I
have found a place I can buy the parts in California, but the cost is bey=
ond
my budget ($1200 used).  The guy that would sell them does diesel engine
upgrades.  He installs 1.9 liter diesel engines in diesel vanagons.  He a=
lso
does a turbocharged version.  He has not done the diesel to gas conversio=
n in
either a diesel or gas Vanagon, but would like to.  If anyone would like =
his
name and number, let me know.
=0D
Of the two diesel Vanagon to gas conversions that I have seen, one was do=
ne
by Elmar Kruza in Streetsboro, OH.  Streetsboro Foreign Auto (330) 626-24=
56.
The other was done by the owner who has his own VW repair business in
Tennessee.  I don't recall his name, but he was associated with the
Appalachain VW Club headquartered in or near Sevierville, TN, I think..  =
Both
Vanagons were at the German AirSucker Society show in July. I also saw on=
e of
them at the Bug Out in Manassas, Va. in May and at the Cincinnati VW Club=

meet in Sept.
=0D
I believe the conversion will work.  I just need a donor vehicle to make =
it
happen.  If anyone knows of one that is complete but has a blown diesel
engine, for example, let me know.
