Subject: EV VR6 non-camper sighting

Those of you who've noted my occasional postings might recall
we live in northern Vermont.  Fact is, we live about 9 miles
north of a fairly well known place called Stowe.  During this
time of year, Stowe is overrun by touroids &amp; ski people.  They
all look as if they've just stepped out of a New Yorker magazine,
an effect achieved, I think, with some effort.

Anyway, the reason I'm writing is to say that driving through
Stowe today in our EV on our way into Burlington for a friday night
Italian dinner at Papa Frank's (in Winooski), I spotted a brand
new EV VR6 coming the other way down Main street in Stowe.

It was outlandishly painted with a wild blue K2 paint scheme, and
was clearly some kind of VW-sponsered courtesy vehicle operating
around one of the resorts.  It also said, &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; on it.

But what was neat was that unlike every other VR6 I've seen so far,
this one was a stright van, not a camper conversion.

The guy was a ski resort courtesy van driver type, 
and didn't return my wave.
