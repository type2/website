&gt; Just got off the phone with Bill Baumann (?), the organizer of the
&gt; bi-annual Busses by the Arch event. He sounded very excited about the
&gt; prospect of having a *caravan* of out-of-state type 2s attend the event.
&gt; Unfortunately, BBTA will take place on Memorial Day weekend, May 26-28,
&gt; which is almost 2 weeks before our scheduled arrival in St.Louis (June
&gt; 12th). What are the chances that we change our plans accordingly? 

I for one would have no problem with it, as I have to take off work no
matter when we have the trip.  I do remember that a lot of people had
school/teaching commitments.  To make it to St. Louis by May 26-28, we
would need to start the trip around May 1st.

IF you are planning on participating and IF you cannot possibly do the
tour on May 1st (or a little later if you are joining along the way)
PLEASE EMAIL ME (schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil) and let me know so I can try to find
a way to make this work.

Another thought just came to mind... We could _start_ the tour in St. Louis
on May 26 and work our ways back Eastward/Westward to the coasts.  How
does THAT strike everyone?  Kind of keeps anyone from going all the way
across the country, but I don't think anyone was going to do that anyway...

If you are participating in the tour, please let me have your thoughts...
