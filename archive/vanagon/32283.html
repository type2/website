&gt; Isn't that the way it always goes, the really important
&gt; people stand behind the light while the one in front of
&gt; the light gets all the glory.

Geesh, I think I'm being stroked. It's not like I don't get enough of that
for the '89 Westy hiding in my garage.

&gt; Have I buttered you up enough?  No one on THIS list would
&gt; ask you to do anything untoward, but if they're handing
&gt; out free samples that have a V and a W in a circle, I'm
&gt; sure somebody here could find a use for it.

I don't know what we'll be giving out, except that we're likely to lean
towards a red glued-together &quot;ADP&quot; logo.
