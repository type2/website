Subject: Used Bentley Manual for Sale
Date: Tue, 10 Jun 1997 09:45:35 -0400

I have a spare Bentley manual for sale. It was purchased last year so it
is most likely the latest edition. It has a few greasy finger prints but
all of the pages are present and none are ripped. The cover is also in
good condition. I would like to sell it for $45 plus shipping. I live in
NJ.
