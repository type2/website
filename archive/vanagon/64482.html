Subject:      Re: Stereo / CD Issues

I have sunk a couple of bucks into the sound system of my early '83 Westy.
Nicer name brand cassette head unit w/ removable face. The sound still
stinks. Road noise and ill placement of the 4&quot; speakers in the lower front
doors by the install people. 8&quot; Blue Thunder for low end under the rear
bench in a box designed for placement behind a GM pick up truck seat, amp,
and cross overs, capacitors on the 4&quot;ers. Boston Accoustic 4&quot; in the rear
stock locations. Rear overhead does not have the A/C unit. It's the stock
storage cabinet. Front 4&quot; were placed lower than I would have prefered!
Anything heavier than elevator Kenny G cocktail jazz poop sounds horrid. No
A/C, so I have the windows down in the Arizona summers...

Can anyone tell me if there is a difference between the front door panels of
the early '80-early '83 Vanagons and the '83.5-'91's? An acquaintence of
mine has a later model and was able to install the speakers where the stock
ones were. The high dollar install clowns said that they couldn't find a
shallow enough 4&quot;-6&quot; to place them in the stock location. Installed to allow
for the catch-all tray on the drivers door. The existing Boston Acoustic 4&quot;
are overdriven by the time the sound is audible while driving.
Suggestions?
