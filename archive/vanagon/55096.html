&gt;| It's worth the $75 for the VW shop manual if you don't already have it.

	Is this the actual shop manual that sets out everything that VW
mechanics are supposed to know about your vanagon or the Bentley Factory
manual? I tried asking at a local dealer to see if I could buy the same manual
that VW mechanics use, the ones that give you time estimates, and they didn't
understand what I was asking for. I know there are Protraining manuals
refered to in a few discussions, is this the same manual?
