Hole drilled struts:

The problem is that while it works for you and the other's in your family 
who know about it, it doesn't work for the friendly neighbor who helps you 
one day by shutting the hatch.  Of course, if the cotter pin is small 
enough, it just shears, and no other damage is done, so you just keep a 
supply of spares.

For many years, I used an after market prop on the struts (mentioned 
elsewhere at about $5 each).  This worked fine even though many folks shut 
the hatch without knowing about the modification.  These things are 
designed to temporarily deform under stress and pop away from the strut.

However, I was finally able to find replacement struts at my FLAPS for 
about $40 each.  It is a real luxury to be able to close the hatch with one 
hand again!  Now someone posted that JCWhitney has the replacement struts 
for far less than the $40 that I paid.

Mike
