Subject: Vanagon rear wheel camber adjustment

Jeff:

        I have experienced excessive wear on the inside of the tread
on both rear wheels.  I had +40K miles on the tires. I tried to adjust
the camber to the correct values, but the adjustment 'bottomed out'
before the correct camber was achieved.

        I was led to believe the coil springs have weakened over time, 
and this produces an increasing negative camber to the rear wheels.
The pivot axis for the trailing rear wheels is not perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of  the vehicle, so when the coils begin to sag, the 
camber just becomes more negative with time.

        What I need to do, and probably you too, is to replace the coil
springs.  New ones will undoubtedly be a fortune from VW.  Is there
any point in looking for used ones at the auto wreckers, or is it very
likely, they will have as much sag as my current ones? Does any
one know of a manufacturer that has a generic coil spring that will
do the job?

I'm crying on the inside........(inside of the rear tires, that is........)
