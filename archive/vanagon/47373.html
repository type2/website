Subject: Re: Border Crossing 

Hey Now,
 I drove my 95 EV-Camper into Canada last year just after I bought it. That was
a breeze. Unfortunally getting back into the US was not so much fun. When I was
asked the typical questions I was forced to say yes to having weapons since
I brought my archery set with me across the boarder. At the time I had short
hair and had changed out of my tiedye just before the boarder. Well they
tore my van apart for about 20 minutes. The strange thing was they wouldn't
let me watch them do the search. I had to entertain some inquisitive
interigator. The questioning was hot and heavy until I mentioned that I
am a Computer Professional working for a Swiss Bank. It's funny how you can
say just the right things that will either get you deeper into trouble
or off the hook all together. Anyone close to the boarder guards know what
they are looking for in their interigations?

Apparently its best to have your answers ready. Giving specifics will keep
the guards in line. Ie, &quot;I will be in canada for 5 days traveling to town X.&quot;
The wrong way to say that is, &quot;I don't know how long I will be in canada
and we'll decied where were going when we get there.&quot; Let them know you
are employed, know where you are going, and have nothing restricted within
you car.
