Subject: VW rentals

Does any major rental company carry Volkswagens?

My wife is dragging us to a medical conference in Anaheim in mid-September
and it would be nice to rent a Eurovan (wouldn't it though?). We're
considering  buying one when they bring the new ones in, and a four-day
test drive (even on the old model) could help us make a better decision.

Also, we're looking for things to do in the Anaheim/LA area and it just
occurred to me that I might take time to visit VW places and people.
What's/who's in reach of Anaheim?

And what's the current adult and child one-day rate at Disneyland?
(our daughters are coming along)
