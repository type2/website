What?  There are actually manuals for the tents?  I guess that's why it

	So can you tell me what is the manual besides set up?  Perhaps 
care of the material? Maby I need a copy too, mine is a 71'.

&gt; Michael, you lucky dog! Where did you did get that tent??
&gt; I have the '75 Westy manual, and on the last couple pages is a description
&gt; of how the poles fit together. I'll try to scan it in and send you the
&gt; file. If that doesn't work, I'll just make a copy and send it to you per
&gt; snail-mail.
