&gt;      Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;      I agree there is a great deal of value in getting your vanagon back
&gt;      into stock shape.
&gt; 
&gt;      However, for people who are struggling financially, there is another
&gt;      hub cap option.
&gt; 
&gt;      For under 20$, KMart sells PVC hubcaps that look pretty darn good.  A
&gt;      nice option considering the dealer asks like 65$ each for the original
&gt;      hubcaps.
&gt; 
I was driving up thru MI a few years back and on route 27 / 127 north of
Lansing on the east side of the road was a hub cap shop.  Found wheel
cover for my '83 for $25.  They had an extensive inventory, looked very
professional.  If any of you live in the area, you might look them up,
post their number.
