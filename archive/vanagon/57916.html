Subject: is it a bad expansion tank cap?





I was looking at a 90 GL the other day that looked pretty good.  While
inspecting it, I noticed that the overflow tank was up to the max mark, but
that the expansion tank was only half full.  Is this the typical symptom of
a cap gone bad that will blow coolant out to the overflow tank, but won't
suck it back in when it's needed?

Also, this was an AT, why is it so hard to get it to kick down into passing
gear on the highway?  Is it a safety feature because the little wasserboxer
is already reved up so high?

Karl
