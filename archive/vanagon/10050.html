Subject:      window rubber: removing those unsightly plastic thingies

well ... your windows won't leak. i don't know if they'll fall out ...
i suspect they will NOT *Fall* out, but they might be easier (??) for some
drunken buds to push/kick out. ;)

it would certainly be a helluva lot cheaper than doing what i did ... which
was to buy the euro-normal/after 1989 window rubber and replacing them all.
:( &lt;well, dangit ... it SEEEMED like a good idea at the time!!&gt;

if you are worried about the remaining hole, what about filling it with
black silicone seal? shouldn't take more than about 3 tubes for the
windshield. :)
