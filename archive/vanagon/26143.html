Subject:       Bug Jam '95 - Land O' Lakes, Florida

Hi all,

Just received a flyer for the aforementioned show (Land O' Lakes is 
just north of Tampa).  I have no connection yada yada yada....

The show is Sunday, Nov 12, $1.00 donation for admission (can you 
say, &quot;Not at a drag strip&quot;?  Sure you can!).
Toy &amp; Model Contest
Bug Slam (oh, the humanity)
Hula Hoop and Big Hair Contests (at least it sounds more dignified 
than a bikini contest)
Engine Blow Contest (I can think of ten people on this list who could 
ace that one :)

I note that the event is held in conjunction with the Land O' Lakes 
Flapjack Festival, at the county park on US41 between SR52 and SR54; 
there will be a midway with rides and food (separate admission).  NO 
alcohol, pets, four wheelers, mini bikes, or golf carts.

Fortunately they forgot to mention drugs and firearms.

Plenty of show classes ($25 entry)
Used parts vendor space $15-$30

Accomodations at the Masters Inn, I-75 &amp; SR54, $28.95 for 1-4 people 
(tell 'em you're with the bug jam) 1-813-973-0155.
Also Quail Run Campground (&quot;clean &amp; friendly&quot;) 1-813-973-0999 mention 
bug jam for 10% off.
[nb - there should be some state parks in the area, too - I have a 
link to the state parks system at http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/ but it 
wasn't working last time I checked]

Several sponsors and presenters listed - one I've dealt with is 
Sundance Bug&amp;Buggy in Plant City (813-752-4207) - you might call them 
for more info.

Listed phones:
Vendors &amp; General: Jeannie Brumley (813) 996-6306 T-F 9-6, Sat 9-1
Judging &amp; Classes: David Evans (813) 231-2564 eves til 9pm

Had enough?

My fondest memory of this event is from about 5 years ago when I got 
the chance to start a guy's '58 pickup using the hand crank - way 
cool!

I'd love to go, but I'm getting married in Barbados on 10/30 and 
having the reception in Tally on 11/11 - maybe the bride can be 
convinced to leave her visiting relatives in town and make a five 
hour drive first thing the next am but I doubt it.  Unreasonable 
woman.
