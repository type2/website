Subject: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?


&gt;What I'm looking for is a roof-rack (it's not a pop-top) for
&gt;it, to handle the canoes, the kid, etc.  Anybody got one
                           ^^^^^^^
Yep.  I feel like tying them up there sometimes -- except they'd enjoy it...

Seriously, we use a pair of ($22.95) roof racks from Hechingers' -- a hardware
chain up her in the Notheast.  I use a pair of strong tie-down straps to
hold the canoe down.  It is a 17' aluminum one, and the racks ave held up
well so far.


Oh, Yes, you'll need a couple of Neon colored spray paint cans for color...

BTW, anybody know what I can do to get my bikes up there without paying
$300.00 + on the real roof racks for bikes?
