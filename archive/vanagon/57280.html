Subject: In Search Of Syncro-Westy

I am interested in purchasing a 1990-1991 Westy Syncro.  Will give it
lots-O-Love.  Want one that has been taken care of and in excellent
condition.  Distance is of no concern for the right Westy.  Please let me
know if you have one available.  Thank You

	Happy Boy
