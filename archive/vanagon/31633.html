Subject: California Syncro Off-Road Trip

Hi all,
I sent the following message out a while back and only got one response from
a Syncro. owner.  A couple non-Syncro vans/buses were interested and a
Trooper owner who once owned a Syncro responded.  So, for anyone who might be
interested here it is again:

Syncronauts,
Since my Syncro is now back in service, I'd like to propose a Syncro off-road
trip.  I'm thinking of timing in late January or early February and a
duration of just a weekend.  Location-wise, the high desert areas will likely
be nice this time of year.  Maybe someplace east like, near Barstow?  Maybe a
little bit further northeast like near Redrock Canyon (north of Mojave) would
attract someone from central or northern California?  Suggestions
appreciated.  Let me know if you're interested.
