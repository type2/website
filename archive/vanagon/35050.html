It's different.  It's a very small belt that goes only between the
compressor and the crankshaft.  You have to remove the fan hub to get at
the pulley as it is behind the fan housing.  You will probably have to
remove a little of the rear tin to get the fan hub out, but I'm not
sure.

p.s. I know probably nobody cares but I broke into the 13's today at the
track!  Woo hoo!!  No, not with the bus.  :)
