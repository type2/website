  Howdy all. Since you can now sleep putside without sweating to death,
or being eaten by bugs, I figured it's time again for all the willing
folks on the east coast to come out and sleep together! Er... wait,
well, you know what I mean.
Sooooooo, Let's camp out at my favorite place, William B. Umstead State
Park, in Raleigh NC, on the eve of Saturday, October 14. The gates open
at 8 am, and close at 6 pm. camping is $9.00 for 1 spot, which is good
for 2 buses, and 6 people. 
So come on!!!
If anyone is interested, please let me know. I will be there anyway, so
please come keep me company!
:)
Richard
