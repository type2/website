Hi everyone,

I'm writing about heat this time.  I was under my van and took all the 
advice I got from everyone and inspected my heater.  The hoses all are in 
fine condition, and everything else looks good.  My problem is that the 
valve that controls the amount of heat the inside gets is stuck.  The 
cable is stretched, but that isn't a problem, I was going to permanently 
open the heat until spring.  Is there an easy way to get that valve out?  
I didn't see any obvious way to do it.  Also, there is a valve on one 
side only-why?  There are two hoses off the engine, and the valve is in 
one only.  Does the other one supply heat always?  I tried WD40 on it, 
but5 that didn't do much at all.

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.

Craig

PS-Rick, how is the camping thing coming along.  I want to go in Feb, and 
where ever there is an electrical outlet sound good, as my heat situation 
is shaky right now.
