     Yes, they work, but they will not help you with the fridge.  They 
     fridges run poorly off of 12v, and the solar panel will only deliver 
     milliamps of current at 12v.  The fridge needs amps.
     
     
     They will only help you if you live in a sunny place.  I don't 
     remember the spec on mine, but it delivers a trickle current which 
     charges my secondary deep cycle battery.  I never run the fridge off 
     the battery, and I never run the lights when camping.  I have my 
     stereo wired to my second battery, and sparingly use it to quell the 
     demons in my head while camping for long periods of time.  Of course 
     if you only camp for short times and have the luxury of being able to 
     crank your engine once a day and have the alternator charge the 
     battery, the panel would not be cost effective for you.
     
     If you are considering buying one, search the archives.  There is a 
     lot of useful information on battery isolators, charge controllers, 
     and such for gaining maximum performance out of a second battery (and 
     therefore a solar panel to help maintain charge on it).
     
     It would be useless to wire the panel directly to the fridge if that 
     was what you were thinking.
     
     Hope this helps......

Howdy,
     
Do solar cells work?
I want one for an EV winnie style.
I want it to help run the fridge rather than using propane. 
How much do they cost?   Is one brand better than another?
     
Thanks
Chris
