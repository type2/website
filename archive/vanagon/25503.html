Subject: RE: Aluma-Seal Confessions


&gt;BUT Aluma-Seal has some other interesting properties!  it is
&gt;essentially just powdered aluminum, when mixed with 12N nitric acid
&gt;it causes a highly exothermic reaction!  WARNING: don't try it at
&gt;home or anywhere else (yeah, right).  i found this out the hard way
&gt;when making up a set of metals standards for some AA (atomic
&gt;absorption, not the booze thing) spectroscopy work.  the sight of
&gt;that  violently shaking, boiling, spewing volumetric flask scared me
&gt;more than any other Stupid Thing i've done in labs.
&gt;
&gt;also, powdered Al is what creates the white 'flash' in fire-crackers.


It's also one of the two ingredients in a thermite reaction. If you think
burning a VW case is fun, you ain't seen nothin yet. You use a strip of
magnesium as a fuse, just to get a thermite reaction STARTED.

And no, I'm not going to tell you what the rest of the reaction participants
are. Even I have limits. I will just point out, that thermite surpassed
even napalm as an antipersonnel weapon in 'Nam. 'nuff said.
