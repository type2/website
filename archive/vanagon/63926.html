David,
Just so happens I do have a recomendation. I would not scrap the old one.
Instead, just pull the back off the broken one and send/take it to an
absorption refrigeration repair place. When they give up the ghost on all
three circuits, usually means it's been run out of level for a while.
There's really nothing to complicated to absorption refrigeration,
generally speaking, that a recharge won't cure. It may cost about $125 to
do if you pull the unit and the back off yourself (that's what I paid in
So. Cal. about 3-4 yrs ago), maybe less where you live.
Once you get it fixed, find a nice level spot, as measured with a level in
the refridg itself. Then find a coresponding spot that you can see from the
driver's seat that you can mount a small circular level (I've used the
armrest next to the driver's seat). Glue it down and refer to it when
making decisions about where to park when the refridg is running.
Hope this helps,
Bob Bellanca
