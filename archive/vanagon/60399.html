Subject: pratiical joke played on my van



 The other week I happended to glance up athe the rear of my van and saw 
the word &quot;WORSTFALIA&quot; in black letters on the left hand side of the poptop.

A friend? of mine had got some black vinyl letters made by an outfit in 
Seattle and had snuck them on my van a week before.

Almost perfect match but for the lack of radiused corners at the bottom 
of the &quot;W&quot;.

So if you are in Victoria you'll know my van when you see it.
