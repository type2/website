Dan,
I don't know about the oil-pressure-and-choice-of-filters thing, but on
my 3 VWs (a 78 Scirocco, 88 Fox, and the 90 Vanagon) I switched to Mann
filters (same brand the dealers use, I think) because none of the other
brands (Fram, Deutsch, etc) ever provided a decent seal.  The Mann's are
more expensive, but they do feel like they have that Teutonic solidity.
Just my $0.02 worth,
Joachim
