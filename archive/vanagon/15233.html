&gt;
&gt;Well all you Roadtripping VW Van Nuts, If you don't live in Eastern
&gt;Canada or near New England, Sorry, this probably isn't for you.
&gt;But,  Christian, David Carment, Other Easterners...


Excellent idea, it's too early for me though!! The route from Kingston via 
Wolfe Island ferry (free) then across Wolfe Island to a short ferry to USA 
$7.00 US will save 1 hr driving/gas and is a great break. Customs is also 
low key. Driving across upstate New York can take you into some nice 
hill/lakeside areas, (need my map) then drop down through NH, VT towards 
Boston. Lots of pullover camping in Mt. Washington Valley, spring skiing in 
Tuckermans Ravine, 60 degree slopes! is a rare treat. We used to free camp 
near Boston Common, pick a handy side street, but I'd almost want to be 
bulletproof nowadays. Nahant Beach, about 15 min. north is ideal for 
lounging/breakfast but wasn't great for camping. Durgan Park and The NoName 
Fish restaurants must be visited, eat for two days in one sitting, Noname is 
a BYOB, unless puritan virtues have been bestowed on it lately.  sigh tim s.
