&gt;I have to agree with you entirely here.  We *do* need better public transit
&gt;systems, and we *should* start destroying old cars (or forcing them to
&gt;upgrade to new engines.)

Good thing that will never happen.  As the old saying goes, I'll stop
driving my bus when they pry my cold, dead hands from the steering wheel.
Part of the American ethic is the government not being able to force me to
give up my car  when I bought it and cared for it legally.  They can make
whatever regulations they want concerning yet-to-be-sold cars, but they
will never succeed in forcing an upgrade to (or disposal of) a car that has
been already sold. The average American will not tolerate it.  The same
applies to guns, btw.  Now if the government wants to subsidize an upgrade
(i.e. pay for a catalytic converter to be installed on my bus), I'll
listen.  Otherwise they can stay the hell out of my garage.  *grin*

Those that are truly concerned about pollution and are still driving their
vehicles around rather than walking or riding a bike need to re-evaluate
their beliefs, IMO.
