Subject: 2 vans 4 sale SF area


I don't know a thing about either of these vans for sale, other than
happening to notice them at the last minute this evening while driving
by them.  Both appear to be forsale by private parties, in the East Bay
area of the SF Bay area.  As it was dark, I couldn't obtain the mileage
from either, but here's what I could get

1.  '86 camper (appears to be a Country Homes Camper model), silver
    (or possibly silver-blue?).  $11,900 (wow!).  510.631.1785.  4-speed
    AC, one owner, records, new tires, appears to have a security system.
    Registration current thru 10/85.

2.  Air-cooled ('81-'83?) vanagon L, not a camper, 4 speed, puke
    cream-yellow colored.  Registration current thru 5/85. 510.376.5826

Of the two, No. 1 looks absolutely immaculate.  No. 2 looks &quot;ok,&quot; but
could use some sprucing up.  Hardly any info was posted on the latter,
only the phone number.
Sorry I couldn't come up with any more info, but it was dark!
