Subject: HELP LEAKING EXHAUST (DANSK)



I have just installed new Dansk pipes on my 84.  The two pipes I replaced are
the pipe from the rear (cyl 2&amp;4) of the engine, and the pipe from the 
catalytic converter to the engine. There is a leak at the junction between
the pipe to the Cat and the two pipes to the engine (its a three way 
connection) due to bad pipe geometry (dont buy Dansk pipes).  Does anyone
have any quick fix ideas?  I have tried high temp silicone (copper color)
but it lasted
about 50 miles.  I am thinking of doubling the gaskets up and trying again...
