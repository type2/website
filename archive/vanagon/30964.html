&gt; I'm a little reluctant to do this, because I can see it becoming a
&gt; major time sink.  The problem is that vehicles go on and off the
&gt; market relatively quickly, compared to obscure parts.  I am making the
&gt; assumption that most of the listings here are going to be for obscure
&gt; parts, since the common stuff is so easy to get.  However, we'll see
&gt; what happens.

There is a web site 

http://www.dsv.su.se/~fred-han/trade.html

which is for buying and selling vw cars and parts.  It seems
to be pretty busy.  Seems to be mostly whole cars.

Was your site to be primarily for list members to have a &quot;public&quot;
want list so that we could trade and/or look out for stuff for
each other?  Or do you want it to be more a general &quot;forsale/wanted&quot;
area.  I guess the difference would be in how willing I would be
to go out of my way if I ran across something I knew somebody
wanted, or how easily I would part with something I had.

Not that the fact of someone being on the list means they're an
angel and deserve free stuff, in fact we should probably all keep
the Grendel example in mind when transactions are made.  Then
again, the more people who know about this page and use it the
more parts we'll see.  Hmm.  

Just some more thoughts,
