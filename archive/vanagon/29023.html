They are almost exactly the same height.  On 14&quot; rims the following 
sizes are simmilar in height: 185, 195/75, 205/70.  I personally would 
go for the 205/70 on a Syncro Westy, more rolling resistance, but 
you'll get better traction in marginal situations.

Also... I like beefier looking tires on VW buses.  Those skinny little 
185 tires look wimpy.
