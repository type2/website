&gt; despise most are &quot;Hecho en Mexico) Also, when I pulled the joints from the

&gt; the other two just slid off by hand. Which is right?  Does it matter?


Just turn the axle round 180 degree and put as much grease in the joint 
as you can. That is all.

I tried this method 8K miles ago and I have no problems with it.
