  One interesting thing I noticed there was that about half of all
the VW's and Audi's had TDI on the back. The Passat that we rented had
the TDI engine and it felt like a V6. We got it up to 200 KPH (120
MPH) on the autobahn. I think that it would be a great upgrade for my
Vanagon Syncro over here. Now, if I can only find a passat TDI that
was rear ended and totaled...
