&gt;i got you ALLLLL beat:  1994 Chevy Suburban, limo tint, neon license plate,
&gt;12-inch offset wheels with teenie-tiny tires. brand new, no less. now ...
&gt;them big suckers ain't cheap. and he goes and does THAT kind of 'custom'
&gt;work to it??? ol' P.T.Barnum was right! :)

I think we're treading on pretty thin ice here with this thread.

To normal people, a mature adult that willingly spends their hard earned
money on any Volkswagen Bus/Van (and then proceeds to force spouses,
children, dogs, etc. to ride in it), is far more foolish than any kid who
chooses use money he makes from his after school job to trick out his ride
in the style du jour.

This is especially true when you tell them just how MUCH money you just
spent on your Westphalia Syncro, how MUCH time you just spent repacking
your CV joints, how MUCH space you have to set aside in your rig for the
spare engine when you go on trips, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I love my camper and went to great lengths to acquire
it. But at the same time, every time I catch myself in the bus' rear view
mirror I see a sucker who sold a rock-solid maintenance-free Toyota truck
to be there.

Paul
