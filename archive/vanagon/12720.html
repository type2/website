Subject: O2 Sensor Testing

Hello everyone-

This may be old hat, but i was able to find some old listings concerning
testing the O2 sensor with a VOM.  I don't remember all the details but the
message said somthing about dialing in your CO until you get a reading of
approximately 0.5 volts from the sensor.  Is this correct??  Also, how would
you connect the VOM.. ie. directly to the O2 sensor connectors in the engine
compartment??  I would like to see if my CO adjustment screw is working in my
87' Syncro.  The dealer says it's not.  


Thanks
