&gt;    As for car alarms I fine people tend to ignore them rather than 
&gt;    rush over for a look see.  Isn't human nature wonderful?  

I remember when car alarms first came out, everyone would stare, but then
everyone became immune because of that stupid thing called a motion detector,
whereby every single bird fart would send the car into a spastic fit.  After
a while, it became more of an annoyance than anything else. 

I think that the motion detectors should be outlawed.  Who cars if the car 
wiggles.

Its called crying &quot;wolf&quot; (Wolfsburg?)

And then the car alarms with the &quot;voice&quot;: 'You are too close to the vehicle...'
