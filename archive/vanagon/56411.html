Subject: mystery hose

While checking for the source of a fuel leak by gazing under the front wheel
wells, I noticed the existence of a grey, 1.75 inch corrugated hose sticking
down, open on the end, like a drain pipe.  It is longer on one side of the
vehicle than it is on the other side--both of them are open ended.
Question: Is this OK, or are they supposed to be connected to something
behind the wheels?
Thanks.
