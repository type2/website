I have a 1982 VW Vanagon with 106K miles.  This van is in great condition,
runs beautiful, looks beautiful and has a long life yet to go. It is two
tone, cream &amp; brown.    I have a bad leg and have problems getting in &amp; out,
otherwise I would never sell.  The van is located in NH and can be seen at
any time with appointment.  This is a 7 passenger van with a great sound
system.$3500   Will consider trade for a mini van in comparable condition.
  Emailyour interest.  Thanks, Betsy
