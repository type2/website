Those vans are quite common at flea markets, car shows, etc. They cost 
between $3 and $5 and have a number of different paint schemes and &quot;Pidgeon 
English&quot; sayings. Each of these vans have a friction motor, a sliding side 
door and a disclaimer about the use of VW's name on the bottom.

Wendy, if you are ever in New Bedford, Cove Discount has (or at least up 
until a couple of months ago) a ton of them.
