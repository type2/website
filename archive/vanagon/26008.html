&gt;&gt; didn't feel real good about the job because of the pounding it
&gt;&gt;took to get the races to seat. i'd used some heat from a profane
&gt;&gt;torch                                                    ^^^^^^^

Well, if your torch heated the hub, instead off just cussing at it,
it might have worked....  :)
