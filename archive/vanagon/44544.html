Subject: Re: These could be the tires (Retry)

Hi volks,
&gt; &gt; 	185/70R-14 are NOT the correct size for a Type II vehicle they
&gt; &gt; are almost an 1&quot; &amp; 1/2&quot; too small!!!
&gt; &gt; 	Price doesn't matter.. get the right size...  185R-14 or
&gt; &gt; 195/75R-14 or 205/70R-14....
&gt; hmmm, i'm getting different info from different folks...i was told 75
&gt; would be too big...what do you mean by 185r-14....would 185/80r14 work?
&gt; should i go to 195...now i'm getting confused.

 185/70R-14 are right for EVs, I think. Didn't later model vanagons use 
/70 profile tyres
as well? &quot;Price doesn't matter&quot; seems a bit sweeping to me...:-)
 185R14 is the standard size for most type IIs, from the transition to 
14&quot; wheels right
through 'till at least the mid-eighties.
 185R14 and 185/80R14 are the same thing (80% is the &quot;normal&quot; profile). 
195R14 is a
VW approved alternative. 185/75 is close enough to work fine.
195/75 and 205/70 will also fit, so will 205/75, of course, if anyone 
makes 'em.
 I would support the general approval of &quot;reinforced&quot; or similar 
heavier duty tyres
for busses: My '68 has 185R14 car tyres on it at the moment and it 
rolls noticeably
more than my '71 with 195R14 8-plys did!
  Incidentally, anyone have any thoughts on &quot;performance&quot; tyres for 
busses-My recent
experience with the dramatic difference in handling between my two 1600 campers
suggests that if &amp; when I get round to building myself a Porsche 
engined bus  it would
be absolutely essential to have appropriate tyres on it. What would work well?
I was thinking that something designed for a big car like a Mercedes or 
a Jaguar
might be good, since they are powerful &amp; heavy.

Cheers,
	W.
