Subject: Waht was that about lowering tire pressure on ice?
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 1996 14:54:37 GMT

With winter officially announcing its presence last night, I
am recalling a thread a few weeks ago about using lower tire
pressures to drive on ice.  Can anyone reiterate the details
of that for this &quot;snow &amp; ice newbie&quot;?  I already have some
Z-chains (they go on fast &amp; fit great!), but I'm curious
about the tire pressure technique.
