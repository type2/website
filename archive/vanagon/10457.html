Subject: Steering work advice?

Alright all you VW guru's, HELP!

My 64 has a very worn bushing on the center kingpin. Not to be confused
with the kingpins that the wheels are attached with. This is the one that
goes through the center of the top torsion bar. I would like to remove it
and replace the bushing without removing the entire front end. Is there 
an easy way to remove the ball joints from the tie rods? Any advice 
concerning these procedures would be greatly appreciated.

                                              Steve
