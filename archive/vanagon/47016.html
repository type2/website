Sent to me by a friend.


&gt;There was this male engineer, on a cruise ship in the Caribbean for the
&gt;first time in his life. It was the most wonderful experience of his life so
&gt;far. He was being waited on hand and foot. But it didn't last long. A
&gt;hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship sank almost instantly.
&gt;
&gt;The man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island.
&gt;There was nothing for miles around. No people, no supplies, nothing.
&gt;
&gt;The man gazed around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it.
&gt;He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of his present
&gt;situation. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice
&gt;and looked to the sea for a ship to come to his rescue.
&gt;
&gt;One day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a
&gt;ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true,
&gt;was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came a rowboat. In
&gt;it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen. She was tall, tanned, and
&gt;her blond hair flowing in the breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality.
&gt;She spotted him as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her
&gt;attention. She rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, &quot;Where
&gt;did you come from? How did you get here?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;She said, &quot;I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this
&gt;island when my cruise ship sank.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Amazing,&quot; he said, &quot;I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you
&gt;are there? Where did you get the rowboat? You must have been really lucky to
&gt;have a rowboat wash up with you!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;It is only me,&quot; she said, &quot;and the rowboat didn't wash up; nothing else 
&gt;did.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the man, &quot;how did you get the rowboat?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I made the rowboat out of raw material that I found on the island,&quot; she
&gt;replied. &quot;The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom
&gt;from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;But, but,&quot; asked the man, &quot;what about tools and hardware, how did you do 
&gt;that?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Oh, no problem,&quot; replied the woman. &quot;On the south side of the island there
&gt;is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that if I fired 
&gt;it to a certain
&gt;temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that
&gt;for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,&quot;
&gt;she said.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Where do you live?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the 
&gt;beach.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Well, let's row over to my place,&quot; she said. So they both got into the
&gt;rowboat and left for her side of island.
&gt;
&gt;The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to
&gt;her place. She tied up the rowboat with a beautifully-woven hemp rope. They 
&gt;walked
&gt;up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, and there stood an exquisite 
&gt;bungalow.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;It's not much,&quot; she said, &quot;but I call it home. Sit down, please. Would you
&gt;like to have a drink?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;No,&quot; said the man, &quot;one more coconut juice and I will puke.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;It won't be coconut juice,&quot; the woman replied. &quot;I have a still. How about a
&gt;Pina Colada?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down
&gt;on her couch to talk.
&gt;
&gt;After a while, having exchanged their stories, the woman asked, &quot;Have you
&gt;always had a beard?&quot; No,&quot; the man replied, &quot;I was clean shaven all of my
&gt;life, and even on the cruise ship.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Well, if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor in the cabinet in
&gt;the bathroom.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;So the man, no longer questioning anything, went to the bathroom.
&gt;
&gt;There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed
&gt;to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel
&gt;mechanism.
&gt;The man shaved, showered and went back downstairs.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;You look great,&quot; said the woman. &quot;I think I will slip into something more
&gt;comfortable.&quot; So she did.
&gt;
&gt;And the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman
&gt;returned wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of
&gt;gardenia.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Tell me,&quot; she asked, &quot;we have both been out here for a very long time with
&gt;no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely; is there
&gt;anything that you really miss? Something that all men and women need.
&gt;Something that it would be really nice to have right now.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Yes, there is,&quot; the man replied, as he moved closer to the woman while
&gt;fixing a winsome gaze upon her,
&gt;
&gt;&quot;TELL ME ... DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot; I HAVE TO CHECK MY E-MAIL FROM THE VANAGON LIST I'M 4 MONTHS BEHIND&quot;
