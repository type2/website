Subject: Re: Bus Repairs-Wash. State.

Can anyone recommend a good place to get repairs done on a '76 camper in
the Washington State vicinity?  I don't know the area very well yet.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Where in Washington State are you?  What kind of repairs do you need?
I've got a '72 Bus that I bought from the owner of Northwest Connecting
Rod, He's honest and straight forward but, he mostly just does rebuilds,
heads, race engines, etc.  I take our bus for routine work to Warner's
Auto.  He's in the Southpark (scary) area of Seattle, but, worth the trip.
Of course if your at Washington State University disregard all of this.
