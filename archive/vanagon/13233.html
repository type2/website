Speaking of Canuck Vanagon oddities; this morning I had to push the Westy
out from about 3 inches of water which had pooled around the wheels.
Underneath the ice was too slick to get a grip... but now that spring has
sprung, the grass is riz, I wonder where the birdies is? (apologies to
Ogden Nash).


Martha asks what an Ice Hog is - they are seven foot creatures that resemble
chipmunks on skates; they cruise the canal (world's longest skating rink)
during winter looking for handouts; They do not however eat poutine or
Beaver Tails (other Canauck oddities);

Is it Friday yet?
