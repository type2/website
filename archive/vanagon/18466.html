Subject: Loose bearing in my head!(f)

I spent the Memorial Day weekend tweeking the '57 single cab. I have to keep
it going as a daily wifey driver until we complete the '67 Westy Resto from
He**. Last week I participated in the eternal exhaust manifold 10mm clamp
loosening ritual. Found that I had the header shoved too far forward on the
heater box so I was trying to tighten it up on the narrow part closest to
the box. Backed it off and solved the leak. Cool!
Last Tuesday evening I drive up to the house and get a warm glowing feeling
inside as I approach the Singlecab thinking &quot; Boy I'm glad it's running
great. At least one honey do chore that I can scratch from the list.&quot; Maybe
it was just the 7-11 coffee. Just inside the door my beloved wife mentions
in her best Marge Simpson voice (as I heard it) &quot;Ya know Rusty, there's a
new knocking kinda noise coming from the truck.&quot; Grrrrrmph! So I fire up the
truck and hope that I didn't burn a valve or $omething major. Whew, &quot;only&quot;
sounds like the alternator is loosing a bearing or about to throw the
doghouse fan! Next step is to adapt the wife's short commute to the job.
Drop her off/pick her up until the holiday weekend.
Weekend comes and I spend part of Saturday yanking the, fuel pump, alterator
stand, alternator, backing plates and attached fan. A little end play so I
grab a UFO alternator off the shelf and check the watch. It's into the four
oclock hour so I begin a new episode of play &quot;beat the clock&quot; and drive it
20 miles to the parts joint. The guys are even looking like they are half
way out of the door as I arrive. Success in conning them into testing the
UFO and removing the huge nut on the rear of the &quot;bad&quot; alternator assembly.
Five oclock, door's locked, money is counted and I'm outta there. 20 miles
back home. 
Installation completed early Sunday morning. I stand silently feeling proud
of myself. Gene Berg's guardian Angel lays his hand on my shoulder. I hear
the royal trumpets from the scene in Ben-Hur when the chariots first entered
the Coliseum. Fire up the truck... Arrrrgghh! the same noise exists!!! Next
step logic. No wait, cigarette then logic. (I know, I know but get off my
back would ya?). OK logic. Isolate the noise. 
Laying down on the driveway I &quot;look&quot; for the noise. What do I see? Next step
stand up and bend the apron away from the header that it's banging against,
clean up the tools and have a nice day. Duh!  Mental note: add it to the
list and swear never to tell anybody.
