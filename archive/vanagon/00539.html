Subject: Re: The Suburban saga continues....Again

I may be a little late with my chime but I'm reading a few messages at a
ttime since I'm just returning to the 'net .... hope the preponderance of
opinion is not knocking the Eurovan.

I shopped extensively for a van between the '91 vanagon and the current
'93 Eurovan. I sinmply did not find ANYTHING out there that allowed me to
believe I had a similar value as the Eurovan for the price.

To 'configure' any other van to do what I wanted to do, would have totaled
to nearly three times the price of the Eurovan Westfalia.

Admittedly at first, I was concerning about what I was reading about the
'power' deficit but after driving the Eurovan for nearly 20K miles, it's
not the problem the experts reported it to be. You need to say a prayer
and eat your lunch before you jump out from the mearge lane, from a
dead-stop, otherwise, it can keep up with, if not lead, the higher-priced
brands.

Another factor important to me is the dealer response. My local (purhcasing
dealer) nearly drives me crazy checking and doing follow ups to assure our
satisfaction (I've even willinlyg taken it back in for the peridodic mileage
check ups ... yes its an expensee I could avoid) but I've learned that
keeping in touch with the staff at this dealer has paid dividends for
folks lke me who will get on the road with short notice. Once I had a bit
of hassle from another dealer while on the road, I mentioned it to my
local dealer and the remote dealer was contacted by my local dealer and
informed in no uncertain terms of the collective dissatisfaction. The
remote dealer subsequently contacted us with an apology and a rebate. I
don't have even the reomtest expectation of that happening with a dealer
or manufacturer of one of the other vans we were considering.

I realize many of you out there are do-it-yourselfers, and I tried that
for awhile, but I sure lke the extra insulation of knowing there's some
degree of reputation, reliability andd consistencyy behind my big-ticket
purhcase as well as getting some value up-front for what I thought I was
buying in the first place.

If this Eurovan did not serve my pupose or give me the value I expected,
I'd be willing to lead the charge against the manufacture, dealer or
whomever. Right now, I am very glad to publicly place my vote on keeping
and supporting an expanded Eurovan community.
