&gt;For the first couple of years of the EV you could get a Westie

The only Westfalia version of the EV that came to the US was the 
&quot;Weekender&quot;. The full-blown Westy was available in Canada until early 1994, 
and is still available everywhere else in the world in about 6 different 
versions starting with the &quot;weekender&quot; all the way to a LWB hightop version.
