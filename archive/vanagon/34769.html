Subject: RE: Fix or Dump?



&gt;In addition to an engine rebuild, I have a clicking sound that emanates
&gt;from the vicinity of the rear wheels.  I suspect CV joints, but haven't
&gt;fully diagnosed that as yet.
&gt;
&gt;Further, I know I need new brake cylinders in back and new linings.  I
&gt;don't know if I have to turn the drums or not, but I think not.

Comes with the territory-- any car 5 or more years old, will have these
problems. One of the great things about VWs, is how easy they are to
fix. At your shop, labor costs will greatly exceed parts costs for these
repairs (except the shop might jack up parts prices hugely on you too).

Have you done car work before? If not, you've got the best car in the
world to start on. My suggestion is that you invest in a repair manual
(I favor the one by John Muir, even though it doesn't really cover
Vanagons-- brakes and CVs are very similar from late '70s vans to
Vanagons), some tools, and maybe grab a VW-familiar friend and
bribe him with pizza and/or beer. You'll be surprised how easy these
repairs are to do.


&gt;Beyond this, I've been advised that with my mileage of 115,000, I can
&gt;expect transmission (4-speed manual) and power steering rack problems in
&gt;the next few years.

Well, if you've been really hammering on it, maybe. But VW trannies often
exceed twice that mileage. I'd take that &quot;advice&quot; with a grain of salt,
unless you are hearing strange sounds from the tranny, or it's leaking a LOT 

of oil from the trans.


&gt;but heated up badly and I've been advised I'm looking at significant
&gt;repair costs.  The diagnosis prior to tear-down is one and probably two
&gt;cracked heads and a scored or damaged piston.
&gt;
&gt;For planning purposes, I can afford to repair the vehicle, but would not
&gt;want to take on another car payment right now as I recently bought a
&gt;pickup.  So, if I buy another, I'm going to have to look at $5000 tops.
&gt;
&gt;The question is:  fix or dump it?

How passionately do you favor VW engines? You might consider doing
what the guy I bought my Vanagon from, did: put an American engine in
it. Takes a lot of work and some fabrication (which he did all of, not me,
so it's easy for me to talk), but the results are terrific IMHO. How would
you like to regularly take hills at 65 mph in fourth?
