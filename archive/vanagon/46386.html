Subject: Re: For David E Most, (was: Re: by the way Joel, change the stats)

&gt; Cool that you have a new van!
&gt; I'm intrigued at what your van is though.  VW did not make a &quot;87 Westy
&gt; Multivan Wolfsburg Edition&quot; - at least not for the US market.  If you don't
&gt; mind, please help me understand what you have.

You're the first person to recognize this, and maybe you can help me 
too.  The person I bought it from told me that it was special ordered by 
the first owner from Germany.  Apparently he owned a VW dealership.  I 
bought it from the second owner who had it for 1 year and put 3k on it.  
He didn't know much about it, and it didn't come with any manuals other 
than the ones the 2nd owner ordered so he could learn how to operate the 
heat. I'll start by answering your questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Does it have a pop-top?
&gt; Does it have the sink/refrigerator/stove?
&gt; Does it have swiveling front seats?
&gt; Does it have rear-facing seats behind the driver's &amp; front passenger's seats?
&gt; Does it have a table that folds up from the driver's side wall?
&gt; Does it have aero-style fiberglass bumpers or steel ones?
&gt; Does it say &quot;Multivan&quot; on the rear hatch?
&gt; Does it have &quot;Wolfsburg Edition&quot; emblems in front of the two front doors? -
&gt; If so, what solor are they?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other significant identifiers?
&gt; 
It has a pop-top, no sink/fridge/stove,one rear facing seat behind the 
passenger seat but none behind the drivers seat (but there are two bolts 
sticking out of the floor there where something might have been), front 
seats don't swivel, has fold-up table, steel bumpers, no multivan on rear 
hatch, has 2 wolfburg edition emblems and all woflsburg features 
according to wolfsburg 87 manual such as alloy wheels, lower body 
construction, power mirrors, locks, and windows etc.

So can you confirm that this is an odd bird??  Also, there's a second 
battery under the driver's seat, a VW battery with whit plastic casing 
that has cables going to it.  In addition, there's a second cigarette 
lighter plug under the passenger seat on the side.  

I had thought when I purchased the van that the second rear facing seat 
was missing, but now I'm wondering if those 2 bolts were attached a 
removable fridge that plugged into that cigarette ligher.  This might 
explain why it came with a second battery (though I understand that some 
of the campers didn't come with a second battery).  I'd like to know what 
the second battery is for and/or if such an option for a fridge existed.

I've called VOA, but I'm waiting to here what the option codes on my 
vehicle identification label correspond to.  

If you have any other questions, pass them along.  OH, there's also a sun 
roof in the poptop, but this may have been standard.
