Subject: Re: Wasserboxer ATF cooler replacement

  So my question (there
&gt;had to be one here somewhere) is: can I just remove the transmission
&gt;mount and let the whole thing down the necessary 2 inches without
&gt;detaching the transmission from the engine?  Would it be sufficient
&gt;to loosen the rear motor mounts to provide enough hinge effect?
&gt;Would lowering the tranny 2&quot; in place break or bend the shift linkage?
&gt;
&gt;If this apparently-minor job requires pulling the transmission all
&gt;the way out, I think I'll let the shop do it...  


I've dropped just the trans. in a manual, so I don't know what your linkage 
is like, but it's better to err on the safe side, disconnect it. I was able 
to drop the manual trans by simply supporting the engine on a hydraulic 
floor jack, with a big flat block of wood under the oil pan. Then remove the 
forward trans mounts and lower SLOWLY, looking for tightening starter wires 
/hoses/ linkages!!! You won't have to lower the engine much to tilt the 
trans down 2&quot; at the front. You MAY not need to disconnect the linkage, just 
keep checking to see if it is being load3ed up as the trans drops. Clean the 
trans thoroughly near the cooler before you re/re it. 
        BTW-&gt; Get familiar with the floor jacks hydraulic release valve, 
open it smoothly and gently, don't just crack the sucker open or you will 
surely break something when the engine drops. Practice while putting the van 
onto stands. Maybe put a spare jack stand with wood block under the trans. 
to 'catch' the engine/trans if things get out of hand. You won't need to 
remove the axles for this job if you have the van up on jack stands. A 
decent scissors jack would likely work as well, if you can get the height, 
just make sure things are well lined up/supported.   tim s.

:) good time to flush and change the coolant, or catch/reuse if it's newish.
