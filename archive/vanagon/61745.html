Hi,

This may be illegal!!  But the easiest way to do it is to get a British
listy to send you a bottle of the yellow headlight lacquer that is used
when on holiday in France.  Yellow main beams are mandatory there.  I've
used it often.  Stuff paints on easily, cleans off with methyl-alcohol. 
Easiest/cheapest way to go. Maybe you can find similar at good artists
supply store?  Yellow beams are way way better in fog/snow.

bye, Tim
