Subject: Fuel filters- diesel vs. gas.

Here's the deal:
        I had a real bad problem with the filter on my trusty 71.  I was 
thinking about the problem for a while.  I figured that a neat solution was 
to use a generic oil filter base and mount a spin-on fuel filter onto it.  
Here comes the problem:  There are no spin-on fuel filters made for gasoline 
applications.  They are all made for diesel applications.  I found one about 
the right size, and was thinking about mounting this on the fan housing.  
The only nagging question is what is inside that little canister?  Will it 
filter gas as well as diesel?  Is there a problem at the gasket?  All the 
rest is easy.  Does anyone have any ideas about this one?  Am I crazy?
