Subject: Re: Used wheels, are they OK?

Hi Drew.  I've often wondered the same thing about used wheels.  Try 
to get the wheel put on a spin balancer to make sure it's true.  I 
would hope that a reputable shop will &quot;prove&quot;  the wheel for you.

Take care,
Harry.

&gt; During this weekend's snow storm, my wife was going around a
&gt; corner and the rear end slid out and the wheel banged against
&gt; a curb. It bent the rim so the wheel needs to be replaced. 
&gt;  
&gt; I found one at a local junkyard for $35. 
&gt; 
&gt; Two questions: Is this a reasonable price? Are used wheels generally
&gt; &quot;safe&quot; to purchase?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, if anyone has an extra wheel they want to get rid of, let
&gt; me know.
