Subject: RE: Westy Mystery Bracket

I don't know (yet), but if you find a couple first, send me one... : ' )

My, my... the telepathy running wild on this list. I was JUST thinking
about sending a post in search of a used swivel table for my '77. That is
what the two braces are for, the ones left of the sink in Westies.

So who knows where to find a table??
