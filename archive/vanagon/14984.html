&gt; a buddy of mine is moving back out west (LA) and was interested in purchasing
&gt; a single - prefably double cab transporter.  anyone with any leads? u can
&gt; email me directly at 7039ckrah_at_umbsky.cc.umb_dot_edu.  What do these beasts go
&gt; for, and how available r they.  Anyone along the west coast (calif., oregon,
&gt; wash) is within range.   thanx in advance....

The San Jose Mercury News had one the other day, but I don't have the info
in front of me. I do remember that it was a '59 Single Cab and they want
$2500 for it...
