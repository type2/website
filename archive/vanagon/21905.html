Subject: VW T&amp;A Info Request

markus benne's info request reminded me of a info request i have.

I am trying to find someone that has the August 1995 issue of VW T&amp;A. (
joel walker already disposed of his issue)

Specifically I am trying to find the printed response that VW T&amp;A printed
to my letter that they publised. The letter i wrote (and that they
published in the AUg 95 issue) concerned  Eckel roofracks. Please e-mail me
privately if you have a copy of the mag and their response.

Thank you!
