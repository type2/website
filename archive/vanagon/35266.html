NEVER EVER SEND SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN!!!!

ASK WHO WANTS IT FIRST!!!!
THEN DO A SELECTIVE MAILING.

A MAP TO A PARK I LIVE MORE THAN 3000 MILES FROM MEANS DIDDLY SQUAT TO ME, 

THINK NEXT TIME, THIS LIST ISN'T JUST IN YOUR BACKYARD, 
TRY TO IMAGINE HOW MUCH TRAFFIC YOU GENERATED &gt;&gt;&gt; WORLDWIDE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

I GUESS THIS RETRY IS DUE TO THE NUMBER OF BOUNCES FROM PEOPLE
WHOSE MAILBOXS YOU OVERLOADED!!

Tim Smith, just a tad p*ssed this AM.
