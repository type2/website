So Joel Walker says:
&gt; are, but i have no idea where many of the others are.
&gt; 

Okay, I'll be nice.  But just this once! ;)

I'm in Sacramento.  As if you didn't know.

It's considered to be Northern California.  If Thom F. 
says it's in the south,  I'll track down his '56 bus and
ship it to LA.

BTW You would think with all the VW goings on (Buses at the Rock, 
Buses by the Bay, Buses in the Bay) on the New England etc. region
that they'd have more buses on this list.  Well at least from what
I used to read in the LIMBO newsletter.  I guess they like VW buses
but aren't too keen on computers.  ;)
