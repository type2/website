&gt; 
&gt; &gt;have y'all(s) done it in the past?  Someone before me put the wheel on
&gt; &gt;rotated by 180 degrees, which is fine except for the part about driving
&gt; &gt;thirty miles down the road with an uncancelled blinker going %-( ...
&gt; 
&gt; it's possible that someone screwed up the alignment underneath the car.
&gt; if they take all the ajustment out of one side, it'll move the wheel like
&gt; that. might want to get that checked first, then (with the alignment correct)
&gt; move the wheel to where you want it.
&gt; 

What I've done on previous buses I've owned is to rotate the steering
wheel 180 degrees so the horn works.  It seems the copper strip around
the steering wheel gets burned out, leaving a section that no longer
allows the horn to work when driving straight forward.  I'd rather have
a working horn than a cancelled turn signal.
