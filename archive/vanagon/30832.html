     what so you mean that '67 single cab that I am doing the 'barndoor'
     conversion on (really!) is a big no no ????
     
     I've got the bumpers, the roof section, semiphores, little lights 
     etc.. and an angle grinder ;)

uh, hate to pop your bubble, Lee,  but they didn't make single cabs in 1950.
  and they didn't have rear bumpers then.  are you sure you have '50
taillights?  What do they look like?  
If i sound anal, it's because i know what it's like to try to find this
stuff, and it's hard to know where to look to find out what to look for.
Cut up your truck if you like,  but why?  It's probably better now, nless a
tree fell on the front. ( nice picture of mushed bus from the storm in local
paper)

funny thing about barndoors is that (yes really)  people dont notice.  Its
just an old bus.  A guy i know whos been doing vws for 20+ years has a split
window bug (that's the back window),  and he said it really turns heads- just
a conservative green bug,  but split!  His barndoor micro,  no one looks.  

Actually, there is a guy who does the vw swap meets in the NW, who has a
yellow bus that looks like a split in the front, and a fishbowl bus in the
back.  Story was the bus got mashed in front,  and he had a parts bus witha
nice nose that was crunched in back.  Still had late suspension etc.  This
was salvage,  not cutting up a nice split.  (Unless he changed his story as
he was embarrassed)
