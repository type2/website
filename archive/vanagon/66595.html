Jim,

&gt; I don't intend to tow
&gt; the sailboat BUT I have an 18.5 ft. kevlar canoe that I'd like to be
&gt; able to mount on top.

I have an Old Town 17' Penobscot that I have hauled all over the U.S. on
my '85.

We adapted a Yakima mount, and had it permanently attached to the
poptop, then I throw the bars on it when I need them. With the extra
long bars, I can take the canoe and a couple of bikes.

I tie the canoe down in front and back, and I've never had a problem.
Before the Yakima, we used those little foam things that pop onto the
gunwales. Never had a problem with those either.

I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.&quot;
