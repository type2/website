Oh Oh? What is the prevailing opinion on what to do with gas
      during winter storage? Does the gas gum up and cause problems?
     I've been leaving the tank almost full to eliminate condensation,
    and potential rust problems? Is this the right thing to do?
   I'm quite paranoid about screwing the Fuel Injection system because
  I'm clueless about it, and suspect all the parts are Big Bucks!!!

What should I do with the gas situation before putting the van in an
unheated shed for the winter? Winter here is severe. -20F not uncommon.

Thanks for any info
