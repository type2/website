Scott:  I share your concerns as do many others, I'm sure.  Guess

&gt; My apologies for singling Ron out, and I do wish him luck in his
&gt; venture, it does take alot of courage to start a small business these
&gt; days-but honestly, some concerns of mine, and others (judging by the
&gt; response I've been getting) is the use of the list for commercial
&gt; purposes.  I will agree that mail order has its place for the informed
&gt; consumer.  A more immediate concern is the proper use of the list.
&gt; This is dependent on how this is handled in the future, but Ron has
&gt; already stated that he plans on letting us know when &quot;a specific
&gt; opportunity avails itself&quot;.  Shouldn't we offer the same courtesy to
&gt; any VW retailer/mail order company that wishes to use the purchasing
&gt; power of the list? If not, why special priviledges to the few?  Its
&gt; fantastic that we have the ability to purchase parts at a reduced rate,
&gt; but are't we opening up a door that best remains closed? Every list
&gt; I've been a member of actively stomps down on ANY commercial enterprise
&gt; trying to cash in on the purchasing power of the list. From what I've
&gt; seen, it's generally frowned upon in the on-line community.  Pointing
&gt; people in the right direction to obtain parts/service -sure.  Blatant
&gt; commmercial advertising-no thanks.  By opening up a business Ron has
&gt; put himself into a new category.  He is no longer a listmember trying
&gt; to get us a good deal and covering his expenses.  He is now up there
&gt; with Bus Boys, Parts Place, etc., and should be treated as they would
&gt; be if they were to try to advertise on the list.  Oh well, I've said my
&gt; piece, let the spamming begin.
