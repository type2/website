Subject: RE:  Alaskan Trip

Jonathan commented on his concern for headlights, windshields, etc.
for a forthcoming Alaskan trip.  I've replaced only two headlights
in over ten years of driving the Alcan,  with a Vanagon but I concur 
with his advice to bring a spare.  I'm on windshield #6 and I 
typically only change them when I have over a dozen starbursts 
(rock chips) or the cracks severly limit visibility.
I've never had a flat and doubt that two spares are needed if your 
tires are in good to excellent shape.  I would, hovever, recommend
a bra for the front of the vehicle, and change your deductable for
comprehensive to the minimum.

By the way, I'm tenatively scheduled to bring up the &quot;Viking Edition&quot;
on October 15 or 16th from Kansas City to Fairbanks if anyone is
interested (email me direct).
