Subject: Electrical problems are driving me mad!

 I have successfully been using my '66 camperwidget as a daily driver for
the last 2 weeks, then about 2 days ago, it just stopped charging!
Went back, pounded the regulator with a heavy screwdriver, and it worked
intermittently after that. (Charged the battery more often than not.) Fine.
got new regulator. Polarized generator. No charge. Light is on constantly
now. OK, here are the troubleshooting steps I've done: (BTW, it's a 12v
conversion that hasn't given me any trouble until now.)

1) All connectors that even are vaguely associated with the charging system
  are now shiny, clean, and tight.

2) Generator output is ~14 volts.(analog meter.)

3) Took a known good regulator, still didn't work.

4) generator/regulator are all remanufactured Bosch stuff.read: new

Is there something obvious that is inherent in these older busses that
I've missed? I mean, I've even degraphited the commutator today! Cleaned
the brushes! I hate electrical problems! ARRGH!
