&gt; 	Howdy :
&gt; Cn anyone here advise me as to how I can safely remove the metallic trim

This has come up a few times. I assume that you're talking about the plastic 
chrome strip that runs around the windshield (and side windows) inside the 
rubber seal. The consensus has been that for safety reasons it should be left 
in, although I don't think that anyone who removed it actually had their 
windshield blow in on them.  The other important point regarding this strip is 
that it's easy to pull out, but a bitch-ola to put back.

Recently I read about some stuff on another list (BMW?) called &quot;black again&quot; (I 
think) that after applying it chemically turns black and really stays on there. 
I seem to remember that there are a couple of different brands, one of which 
remains a little sticky.

Any experience with these esoteric goo's?
