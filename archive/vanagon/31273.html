&gt; I have a 93'MV weekender with the removable passenger side jump seat.  This

&gt; extensions that stick into the floor have to enter the floor behind (toward
&gt; the rear of the vehicle) the bar in the floor to allow the seat to click into
&gt; the passengers seat.  Looking at these extensions it looks as if they are
&gt; supposed to enter the floor in front of the bar (toward the front of vehicle)
&gt; this would allow the seat to be alot sturdier.  I have tried to move the
&gt; latch to allow for this.  But unfortunately there isn't that much adjustment.

I'm a bit confused by your description.  To latch my seats in I have to 
clean the crud the kids dropped into the slot (okay not every one will 
have that step...)

I lean the seat toward the rear of the van.  Set the legs into the 
slots.  When I raise the seat back to vertical the legs grab the 
horizontal bar tightly.  Just the way you seem to think.  Is this one 
seat and you have the cooler seat since its a weekender?  I've got two of 
these folding seats.  Possibly got something bent?  I'll have to look at 
my van itself and see what 'might' be wrong.
