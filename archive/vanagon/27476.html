Subject: vanagon heat

I have a 81 Westy Vanagon with the built in gasoline heater.
It appears to work under the following circumstances:

	1. Engine running, heat on full, switch rotated to on position.

	2. Engine off, switch pushed in and rotated to engage 10 minute
	   timer.

#1 works well when driving and #2 works well to preheat the van before
driving.  I would like to wire in a third option.  That is, I would like
to install a thermostat in parallel with the timer so that the heater would
kick in every once in a while when camping overnight.

Other than running out of gas, I can't see a problem with a functioning
heater.  I suppose a broken heater might vent exhaust gases into the
heater system, but that would be a problem while driving as well.
This would be no worse than an auxilliary propane heater, and a lot
cheaper.

Anybody done this?
