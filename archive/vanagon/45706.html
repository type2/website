Subject: Help in Madison,WISC!!

All,

Hey there.  I'm over in Barcelona (recently posted and got great responses re
: Buy in Germany?) and I'm looking for a Westie (ideally a Synchro), but the
high $$ are a problem.  Saw a post this morning for an 87 Synchro asking $6000
 in Madison, WI, which is in my $$ ball park) .   I would love to jump on this
opportunity if indeed it is an opportunity -  seems like a great price, what
kind of shape is it in? ( I'll be the first to admit that I don't know my ass
from my elbow when looking at an engine, but I'm looking forward to the
learning curve!).  Is there any kind and mechanically inclined soul out there
who knows Westies and  could possibly take a look at  this for me (I have the
phone#)?  I'll be back  in the US in August and could fly out and pick it up. 
I'm planing to love in this baby for a couple of years, so anyone who helped
me out would be doing me a big favor (and I'd be delighted to take you out for
a thank you dinner if it worked out!!).

Thanks very much in advance to anyone who gets back to me

Rich
