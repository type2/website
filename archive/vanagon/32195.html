Just call up VWoA and ask them, they sent me 2 8.5/11's and a VW key chain,
pretty nifty and totally free.

But I guess your in in the UK, maybe someone can call from stateside and
give them your adress abroad.

&gt;ps can anyone get me a copy of the Jerry Garcia / VW bus pic PLEASE? yeah
&gt;right, so some of us over here were into the Dead (!) ...and the Airplane, and
&gt;Quicksilver, Country Joe ...them were the days,,where have they gone!


My dad took our '66 Kombi up to a Country Joe concert in '95, at Beremerton, WA.
