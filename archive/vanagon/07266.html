&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to replace/repair the pop-top
&gt;&gt; screen for an '81 Westfalia?  Ours has numerous holes in it, but the canvas
&gt;&gt; of the top is intact, so I don't want to replace the entire thing.
&gt;
&gt;We had the same problem and killed two birds with one replacement screen.
&gt;We had an auto upholsterer do for us with real &quot;no-see-um&quot; screening that
&gt;we got at REI. It seems they have bigger budgs in Germany since the
&gt;screen is pretty course. Anyway, the upholsterer did it in one day (and
&gt;threw in double zipper pulls for the main window cover as well. I took
&gt;one look at all the screws which hold th canvas portion of the pop-top in
&gt;place and decided this was NOT an easy 'do-it-yourself' project.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, we also put the no-see-um screening in the side window screen frames
&gt;(just glued in a piece over the existing screen) so now we are no-see-um
&gt;protected all around except the back snap in. Of couse, now the flies and
&gt;all get in whenever we open the door and can't get OUT - Oh well.
&gt;
&gt;Hope that helps -Jack

Thanks for the advice.
How much did this process cost?
