Subject:      humming fuel pump

Except for one notable problem, our '84 Westy performed like a champ on our
2,500-mile trip to Louisville and back. We got 24.2 miles per gallon
driving right at 65 mph. Even the kids (5 and 3) got into the behaving act,
going to sleep without much commotion and passing the time playing games.

The only problem happened in Ohio on the way back and it was a nasty.
Driving along at 65 at 8:30 on a Sunday morning (of course), the fuel pump
went out. It felt like we snagged a parachute the way we slowed down. Yup,
nothing like being stranded along the interstate with two little ones and
then having to be towed. At least the kids enjoyed the wrecker ride to the
motel.

The nice folks at the local shop installed a new fuel pump the next day
($239 parts and labor) and we were back on the road by noon. We noticed
soon after we started up again, however, that the fuel pump was really
humming. We'd never heard it before, but it's hard to miss now. Also, the
fuel gauge now drops to half after 50 miles of driving, which was quite a
shock the first time we noticed it. Mileage after the new pump was
installed slipped to about 22.5.

Questions: 1. Is there a break-in period for the new pump or should we have
the humming checked out by our local German shop?; and 2. Could the gauge
problem be associated with the new pump?


*****
On the Vanagon-spotting front, in 2,500 miles from northern New England to
Louisville and back we spotted just four Westies and six other busses.
Amazingly, we saw three Rialtas, nearly as many as the Westies. It was
quite disappointing.
