&gt;   Lets use a little common sense here. Any Car That was 10 years old,
&gt;   with 100k miles would be selling for scrap pricing, if this were
&gt;   the 1960's. Because of autos lasting longer and better design, this
&gt;   deal can be reasonable. BUT in MY Opinion you are on the edge!

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I've found an 87 Synchro which is selling for $4200.  100K miles, nice
&gt; &gt; body, paint, etc.  Is this a good bargain or a sign of trouble ?  I've haven't
&gt; &gt; seen any 87's priced as low as this, and the fact that this is a Synchro (4WD)
&gt; &gt; makes me even more suspicious.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of having a Synchro
&gt; &gt; rather than the 2WD version ?  I assume that there will be more maintenance
&gt; &gt; problems and less MPG, and since I don't plan to live in snow country for the
&gt; &gt; next few winters I wonder if I'll really need the 4WD (although it would be
&gt; &gt; nice in places like Baja California).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Thanks in advance for any advice/comments/suggestions !
