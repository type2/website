Subject:      Re: VR6 in a Vanagon

Hi all,

A friend of mine brought back a VW magazine from Germany about
12 months ago and featured in it was a late model Vanagon
complete with VR6 in the engine bay.
It had a badge with VR6 on the back and had all the Zender or
Projekt Zwo body kit stuff as well.It was medium blue and looked
very cool.
So it must be possible but how easy it was I'm not sure.The text
was in German and my school boy Deutch isn't quite adequate.
I just gawked at the pictures.

I could probably get the mag from him and copy the feature.
Anybody out there got a fax no. and fluent in German who could
then inform the list for those interested?
