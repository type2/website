David, IMO this would a big waste of money.

If you don't have an auxillary battery, a 25 amp draw without the engine 
running will make sure you don't ever get going after an hour or so. 
Starting batteries' lives are drastically shortened by drawing them down 
this far, also.

With a 100 amp hour deep-cycle auxillary battery, you would have less than
4 hours of heat. And that's four hours of so little heat, why bother?
