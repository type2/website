The Bentley manual describes a procedure to increase the mirror's range.
It involves sawing of some tabs under the mirror. 
Good Luck

&gt;Definately not.  The passenger mirror on my '91 works fine but the 
&gt;drivers
&gt;side on has very limited range and gives me the clicking noise you
&gt;describe.  I too would be interested in hearing of possible fixes.
