I think that might be a very appropiate question..
the last posting about life in Inuvik said it could be very ot.
in 1962 I took a trip to the Arctic Circe in Norway Swededn &amp; Finland. It was
scorching hot, even hotter that the South of France on the Med.
I personally have decided to accept what quirks nature has to give me but
would not be surprised to see it very hot.
