&gt; Hey, I'm a coyote too!

OK, so that's at least two coyotes on the list...  so I might as well out 
myself now as well.  I'm a bear (Not the kind you're probably thinking 
of, Ron, I'm too skinny and hairless to count).  Actually, Christa is 
too.  We are of the ursine variety and spend a lot of time up in the 
mountains sunning ourselves, picking berries, and fishing for salmon in 
ice-cold mountain streams.  

I know there are at least two other bears on the list as well, but I'm 
unclear whether the bears are the vehicle, the driver/passengers, or 
both.  

Harry Yates drives the &quot;Polar Bear&quot;
Somebody else (can't remember who!) drives the &quot;Brown Bear&quot;.
We drive the &quot;Bearbox&quot;.

Any other bears, coyotes, or other animals?
