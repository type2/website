Is there really anything at any price that can compare with the Vanagon
(Westy or Weekender)? Even if you replaced the engine entirely (VW H2O,
Subaru or whatever) every 5 years you're still ahead of the cost of a
&quot;new&quot; van (especially a new EV). Besides with a Vanagon you get to meet
such great people.
