&gt;Hi Martha:
&gt;I've been in the CCC list for the last couple of months, hoping to some
&gt;day, when you guys decided to camp on the very north side of California,
&gt;I could join you. (I live in Eugene, OR.) The group sounds like fun, and
&gt;share two of my biggest hobbies, camping and VW's. However, reading
&gt;about your views about the plastic burning issue made me change my mind.
&gt;Without even considering the scientific data that puts plastic burning
&gt;as a bad idea for the environment, consider the following: If there is
&gt;even a small doubt that burning plastics in a campground will pollute
&gt;the environment and create unwanted odors, why do it? It can be THAT
&gt;much fun... I don't think I would enjoy being part of a group that
&gt;allows such irresponsible acts to happen, just for the fun(?) of it.
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Cris.


As opposed to quoting the entire e-mail messag to the extensive list with
no editing and wasting bandwidth.  Our last precious resource?
