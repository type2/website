Subject:       Re: oil level question

Hello Jared.  With all horizontally opposed engines, check the oil 
level when cold, and after it sits for at least 7 or 8 hours.  It 
takes time for the oil to drain into the sump from the cylinders, 
etc.  This is also pointed out in Muir, I believe.. it's been a while 
since I read it.

I use this method will all my vehicles, anyway.  I never fill the 
crankcase either.  I would rather have the crankcase 1/4 to 3/4 full 
than on min or max.  When the engine is hot, oil expands, and I like 
to leave room at the top (if you will).  When I top up, I only put in 
half a can of oil at time as well.  ... Sure like those oil jugs with 
reuseable screw on tops :)

I don't even bother checking the oil level unless it is cold.. it is 
a waste of time otherwise.

Hope this helps.
Harry.

&gt; I have an 82 Vanagon, just got it a month ago. When is the proper time to 
&gt; check the oil, when it is cold or after it has been running for awhile???
&gt; 
&gt; I have checked it both and I am getting conflicting results.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
