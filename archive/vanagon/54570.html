&gt; Well, you don't HAVE to remove the hub.  The hub and drum on the Vanagon 
&gt; are &quot;split&quot;, so you can remove the drum without removing the hub. 

True.  The drum and hub are seprable.

&gt;It's slightly harder to get at everything withoug removing the hub, but I'll

&gt; bet that's the way any brake shop in the world would go about replacing 
&gt; the lining.  

Slightly harder???  With the hub in place it would block most of your access.
 I would suspect this would make it MUCH more difficult.

&gt;Besides, that way you don't need a giant socket, a hub 
&gt; puller and a breaker bar capable of 360 ft-lbs.

Sorry.  Yes you do.  The drum can't come off without taking off the big 46mm
&quot;castle&quot; nut.  After you remove the nut, you could remove the two bolts that
hld the hub to the drum and then remove the drum without the hub, but I don't
see why anyone would want to do such a thing.

The best tool to get the &quot;big&quot; nut off is one that's made to be torqued on
with a 1/2&quot; breaker bar while also being hit with a hammer.  I don't know
what the name of these tools are, but they work well.

By the way, this is a bit fresh in my mind.  I just finished doing the rear
brakes on my wife's 88 Vanagon a few hours ago.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
