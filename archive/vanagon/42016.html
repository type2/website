Subject: Vanagon case breather hose...

Did anyone out there buy the 5-meter coil of hose that the VW dealer (at
least mine) tries to sell when you need to replace the breather between the
air intake and the case-thingy (where the generator stand went on upright
engines)?

I couldn't see spending $27US for 5 meters when I need less than 30cm (12&quot;).

Someone got some left over that I could purchase?

Or should I bite the bullet, buy the coil, and resell it to the rest of the
list a foot at a time?
