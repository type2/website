Subject: Syncro speedometers...

There has been a fellow on the typeII list asking about speedometers, and
this reminded me of one I wanted to ask.

He wants a speedometer with a trip odometer for his bus.  I would not mind
one for my syncro.  I have a regular Vanagon speedo, but the cable on the
Syncro turns at twice the  Vanagon rpm.  It there any way to modify this,
or does anybody know of a Syncro speedo about, or what one expect to pay
for one?  Are there syncros in junkyards?

My speedometer has no MPH markings (only KPH) and no trip odometer.
