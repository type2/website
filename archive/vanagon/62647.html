&gt; I want to thank everyone for the help on my problem (losing power climbing

&gt; Also I was told that I should be using distilled water with the non-phosphate

       I have been saying this all along! It's not the anti-freeze it's
       THE WATER!!!!!!! Hard water is the build up in the cooling 
       system. My 2 WD Vanagon has regular prestone in it. That was
       6 years ago! Runs great had, it in another state last month!.
