Tossing in a EV MV comment or two...

With the two rear facing seats removed and the bed down you can carry 4x8 
sheets of ply wood very easily.  We just did about 20 sheets along with 
16 boxes of floor tiles and a 12'x12' rug.  And a bunch of other assorted 
stuff.  This was on a snowy day and the boards didn't get wet.  Backed up 
to the front of the Home Depot and with the back opened on the EV right 
under the over hang from the store it was dry.  Dang I like that van...

Okay most of the plywood was 1/4&quot; so not that heavy.
