&gt; Why is Lite Beer like making love in a canoe?

&quot;Its f***ing close to water!&quot;

	Hey, I *like* Canada. And if I get to switch from Wannabusser to
proud owner of a single or double cab, it will probably be from Canada.

	I used to live in Washington state, and I noticed that its cold
there, but warm in Victoria B.C. I decided this was because Washington
(specificly Silverdale) was in the cold, northerly part of the USA, while
Victoria is in sunny southern Canada. (They grow peaches in Alberta, f'r
gosh sakes). In fact, taking the ferry boat from Port Angeles, in the
family 68 bay-window, you could look up and see where the marine
layer stopped about half way there!
	Anyone else notice similar phenomina near the border?

	Bill
