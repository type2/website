Subject: EV Camper Question, plus new EV site

I'm getting a lot of e-mail quetions from non-listmembers regarding the 
EV Westfalia pictures I put up on the Syncro Westie page.

Basically, they ask WHY the units are not available in the US. Does anyone know the real 
story?

A correspondent in Norway also pointed me to an Australian EV conversion, the Trakka. 
This looks great! On the short wheelbase chassis; page features a nice cut-away drawing 
converted into an image map which leads  you more details about specific parts of
the camper. Very nice site (also in Japanese). 

I put in a link from the non-syncro section of the Syncro Westie page at:
