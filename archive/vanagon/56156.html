No, the trim is cosmetic.

&gt;I went around the whole windsheild looking for places where the seal had

&gt;couldn't find anything obvious. I do have a couple 1&quot; long sections missing

&gt;and wait for a dry day (and then remember on the dry day instead of going
&gt;somewhere in the dry sunshine ;) )
