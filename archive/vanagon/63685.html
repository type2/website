Subject: RE: Vanagon temperature problem(new thremostat)

   My 1986 syncro runs hot only around town. On the highway it will
   finally cool where the gauge goes below the LED. After fixing or 
   replacing almost everything, I went to find a cooler thermostat.
   At the new Pep Boys Auto parts store in my area, I found a 
   Thermostat being marketed by Robetshaw. It's part number is
   910-180. It opens at 80 deg C. The original runs at 87 Deg C.
   It was only $12.
