Howdy Volks,

	I just lurk around here (hang out more on the vintagvw list)...
but I wonder if somebody would be so kind as to email me the URL of
the WWW site that has vanagon postings???  (Not the gopher site, but
the Web page.)  I had it once, but can't find it again for the life
of me.

	(I'll trade ya for the URL of my Type III WWW page.:)

Thanks!!!!!!!!
-Greg
