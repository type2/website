Subject:       alternator vs. generator for 71 camper

I have an oppurtunity to get a used 78 bug motor with an alternator (I 
will check engine number but i believe it is a 1600 dual port) and my 
plan is to put it in my 71 camper which is used to having a generator. 
 
Basically I'm looking for pros, cons, and considerations putting this 
motor (alternator vs. generator) in the 71 camper.

Is it desirable to put my generator on the motor currently using 
the alternator?

The guy will throw in the voltage regulator for a litle extra.  
I am assuming it has decent compression (this will be checked) and is 
inexpensive ($125 and i toss it in the back of my......we won't 
mention that vehicle name here ;)

I am sure i have seen discussion on this 
topic, but I don't have access to the archives at this time.

Thanks ahead of time.  

Mike 
71 camper
