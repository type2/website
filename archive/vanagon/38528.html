Subject: Vanagon ZO Alloys??

Hi All,

I was looking at a high-end sports-cars-for-sale magazine at the airport 
a few days ago and low and behold there was really neat 68 Dbl Cab for 
sale (16K--ouch!) that had a set of Vanagon 'ZO' wheels.  They look like 
what I call 'Carat' alloys, but had a couple of 'ribs' where the wheel 
center meets the rim--10 ribs per wheel.  Anyone know more about these 
critters?  I have not seen anything like them before.  BTW, it was a 415 
area code on the dark grey 68 Dbl cab with Porsche seats.
