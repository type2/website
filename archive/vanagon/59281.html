Subject: Corrado Bentley Manual at Cost / Corrado List Address??
Date: Fri, 2 May 1997 18:58:28 -0400


I know there used to be a Corrado mailing list, but I can't seem to find
any info on it.  If anyone has info, or could forward this post to it,
please let me know.

I have a Corrado Bentley manual that was slightly damaged in shipping. 
Some oily substance got on the edge of it, causing a discoloration on the
edges of a few pages that does NOT in any way obscure the printing.  The
damage is VERY minor, but it cannot be sold as new.  I would like to offer
it to a Corrado owner at my distributor cost, which is $71.50, plus
postage.  (Cover price is $130.) 

Thanks,
