&gt; &gt;John et al - many of us in the Bay Area prefer the Morro Bay option,
&gt; &gt;since it's a lot closer, but the southern CA site was selected
&gt; &gt;out of the possibility that people from AZ and NM would also attend.
&gt; &gt;Can we PLEEEEEZE hear from those people - whether they would
&gt; &gt;come to Red Rock?
&gt; 
&gt; Morro bay sounds better to _me_!  I think my bus can make it that
&gt; far - I don't know where it is but it sounds close!

Morrow bay is not _that_ close to Sacramento.  It looks to be right next
to San Luis Obispo on the map.  This is a little closer to me than big Sur,
but still a good long trip.  My reasons for preferring Red Rock Canyon
are that I am ready for some SUNSHINE and some WARM WEATHER :)  and I
would like to meet some of the folks from outside of California.  Let's
give this one a chance, folks, please?
