I contend that there's still no such thing as a Vanagon Westy Weekender, at
least by VW definition.  Please show me anywhere in VW's literature where
they refer to any Vanagon model with a pop-top as a &quot;Weekender&quot;.   I admit I
could be wrong, but I've read lots of VW literature and haven't seen this.
