&gt;I have a 91 Vanagon and now am getting a rattle (cyclic) sound from the
&gt;right front wheel at low speeds...Its very prevelant when I take a slow right
&gt;turn or after I hit the break and let up. Its kind of a tink-tink-tink sound...
&gt;Could it be my break calipers, CV joints or wheelbearings???
&gt;I had the rotors replaced within the last 5k miles...pads too....

well ... unless you have a syncro, we can rule out the cv-joints on the front.
since it seems to be related to low speeds and right turns/braking, and since
you had the rotors/pads replaced recently, i'd bet on a sticking pad or
piston in the brake caliper. that is, the pad is not being pulled back
completely out of the way of the rotor. so it's kinda scraping a little bit.

the only way to make sure is to jack it up and spin the wheel manually. see
if it will make the noise then. it would be better to jack up both front
wheels so you can turn them back and forth to check on the noise.

now ... having said that, it MIGHT be the cv-joints in the rear. if you have
about 20,000 - 25,000 miles on it, they MIGHT be making a noise ... which
you might be mistaking for the front of the car. but usually, the joints
make noises more during turns and under load (like hills) or backing up, and
especially so in colder weather.

another thing that can fool you is a rock in the tire tread. you'd be
surprised at the sounds it can make. check the front tires for any pebbles
or even nails or screws.
