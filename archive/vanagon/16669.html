Subject: Re: How do I stop this oil leak?
Date: Mon, 1 May 95 12:34:25 MDT

&gt; 
&gt; I've got a pretty steady oil leak dripping off the little nuts 
&gt; surrounding the oil drain plug on my '71. I've replaced the paper 
&gt; gaskets, the brass washers, the little nuts and even the entire round 
&gt; metal plate with no success. How the hell do I stop this thing?!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

Try Permatex Ultra blue or ultra copper in conjunction with the paper gasket.  Use Permatex teflon thread sealer on the threaded parts and wait 24 hours after application to put in the oil or start it up.
