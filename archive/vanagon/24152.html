Subject: '88 Syncro FS in BC

Saw this with a 'For Sale' sign down the street...

1988 syncro GL 7-passenger with (what looks like) 246,000km on odometer(!).
Looks to be in pretty good shape, several small spots of surface rust, is 
&quot;Phoenix charcoal/bronze&quot; (sticker on windshield).  Owner is asking 
$9,500 Canadian for it, but the ink used to write on the for sale sign in 
pretty faded from the sun, suggesting it's been on the market for quite a 
while....

Phone (604) 948-0710

All usual disclaimers and then some.  I didn't talk to the owner, only 
crawled around on the ground next to it for a minute or two!
