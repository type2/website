&gt;Gregory Mitch Daughtry wrote &quot; O1 would be ozone, the stuff that is created 
when fluorocarbons &gt;released from aerosol cans combine with O2.  Ozone is 
much lighter than O2, that's why it rises way up &gt;there and floats. Hence 
the much touted ozone layer.  So maybe in that sense it is not a condensed 
&gt;version, it's the run of the mill oxygen that we all enjoy so much.&quot;

Actually, O3 is ozone, and that makes it heavier than O2.  I'll stop 
here....
