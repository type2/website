Subject: leaky windshield or what ?

Hey now,
  it's raining cats and dogs IN my bus ! I was gonna wait out the problem,
seeing it was almost spring, but if you live in Oregon and wait for the rain
to stop you may wait a powerful long time...Here's the scoop: I have water
coming in at the front end of the bus (73 breadloaf westy). I figured it's a
leaky windshield, but the windshield seal looks good...okay, LOOKING good
may not amount to a hill of..., uh, anyways: Are there other possibilities?
Like, cold air duct or something ? It's particularly bad if I'm parked
pointing downhill. Water trickles down the front at a rate of a cup per 5
minutes, then pools under the floormats. Its favorite routes are just next to
the passenger door, and out
of the instrument panel, right out of the electrical thingies, yumm..., and
into my left shoe when I'm pressing the clutch...
  Any ideas on where to start looking ? Or should I try to seal the
windshield first anyways, see what happens?
  I know it's hard to lose sleep over this if you're living in Arizona.
Any pointers would be appreciated...
  Ciao,
            Gregor
