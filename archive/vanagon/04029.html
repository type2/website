&gt; 
&gt; Man!!! I did not even see my name on the list of bigmouths....
&gt; 
&gt; Well, anyway, taking heed of Joel's warnings, I thought I'd let you
&gt; guys in on how the &quot;Koolatron&quot;  turned out to be. Some of you will remember
&gt; that I posted a couple of articles asking questions about whether
&gt; the same technology would be applicable to Air-Conditioning, and there
&gt; was quite a few messages, and then the interest died (hey, how about
&gt; a virtual Corp. that produces plug-in A/C units for older vehicles???!???).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, back to the topic, I've had the Koolatron box for two weeks now, 
&gt; and I guess I cannot complain....  It does keep pretty cool even inside
&gt; the van out in the parking lot for over 8hrs., and does not seem to drain
&gt; the battery to any noticeable degree.  I got the 30-liter version, which
&gt; is quite spacious, but, to my dismay, DOES NOT FIT between the two
&gt; front seats of my '87 Weekender :-( ...
&gt; 
&gt; It is a nice thing to have for $99.00 plus shipping, but one thing
&gt; that really upset me is that they sent me the A/C adaptor and charged
&gt; me $49.00 extra for it, even though I specifically asked for it NOT sent
&gt; to me.  Even though a $10.00 radio shack adaptor will NOT work here, I can
&gt; get a transformer powerful enough for much less than that.  And 4 $1.00
&gt; Radio Shack power diodes should do the rest....
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I'll have to get on their case and send their adaptor back...
&gt; 
&gt; I have not had an occasion to try it in heating mode, but, I imagine
&gt; it'll do even better....
&gt; 
&gt;

Whoa!  How can I get more info on this contraption?  You say you
use it when the car is turned off and it keeps you cool?  With
out much battery drain.  Is it a water cooler or AC?  Help me
out here.

Thanks,

Steven
