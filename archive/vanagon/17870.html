Subject: Re: syncro diff fix

Hi, I sent this to Tom only, since it's a bit long. Here is a copy for all 
who care. Sorry   tim s.

An additional comment... The switch on my dash was partially broken, worked 
properly for several days but suddenly the diff wouldn't unlock. Pushing the 
knob in had pushed the (broken) housing back far enough that 'engage' was 
the only option. Fixed it by putting a nylon tie-wrap around the switch body 
between 2 of the vac pipes. This holds the snap-lock mechanism more tightly 
together. If this doesn't last I'll epoxy the sucker together.

&gt;Hi, 
&gt;
&gt;I've just done all this on the weekend.
&gt;
&gt;Those skinny bolts slip in/out from the top very easily, a good failsafe 
should the nuts come off somewhere along the way. Yours must have been 
removed at one time?
&gt;
&gt;        The entire mounting comes off with 2 10mm head bolts, you can 
easily reach the front one with an open ended wrench, not much room for 
movement. A 1/4&quot; drive socket wrench with extension and swivel drive MAY 
fit. I was able to pull the skinny bolts up and out on mine. Rear bolt head 
seemed inaccesible due to the starter. I would get two new skinny bolts and 
cut the old ones off about halfway. Your time is $$ and those bolts are cheap. 
&gt;        NB: You must remove the spring pin between the vacuum servo and the 
engagement shaft. Mine was easy to get at once the servo was pulled away 
from its mounts. The rubber boot over this stuff was very different from the 
illustration in my Bentley manual, impossible to get to the pin unless servo 
was moved away. Bentley shows a nice retractable accordian boot. There is a 
circlip holding the bracket to a fat bushing going into the diff. Remove it 
also to pull the bracket if you are going that way. Don't take the 
driveshaft or starter off! Don't damage any part of the servo, as it is only 
available as a unit from VW, it is made by VDO, they may be able to help for 
parts.
&gt;
&gt;        Test the servo by raising ONE side of your van completely. I use a 
cheapo jack stand to support the rear, bricks against the other sides 
wheels, and the car jack to hold up the front end. Start up your van and run 
it for a minute, the shut it off. This will build/store sufficient vacuum to 
actuate things 3~4 times. Or leave it running, in neutral etc etc, 
preferably pointed towards an open field in case there are problems!
&gt;        Turn the front wheel by hand, the back should go with it, unless 
your viscous coupling is shot! Pull out the Locking knob and keep rotating 
slowly, it may take a turn or so, but the wheels should lock up when the 
diff engages since the opposite wheels are fixed on the ground. Try the 
disengagement, you may have to jiggle the wheel to allow the system to 
disengage. An internal spring forces the system to disengage should the 
servo fail. You can hear a slight whistle each time the knob is moved.
&gt;
&gt;        Dirt etc on the engagement shaft was the problem on mine, so much 
so that the previous owner had disconnected and plugged the vac lines. Get 
everything off, blast with WD-40 and work back an forth by hand using a nail 
through the end of the shaft to grip. Movement is about 3/8&quot; if the locking 
bits aren't aligned internally, about 3/4&quot; when engaging fully. There should 
be VERY little resistance, it glides! If this doesn't work, remove the light 
switch, 23mm wrench, and spray/try again. I spent at least 1/2~3/4hr doing 
ONLY this to get things loose/smooth. The fat bushing will move out about 
1/2&quot; but will NOT come out! It will rotate however, which helped loosen 
things up. It must be rotated back into top position for the light switch to 
fit, use your little finger tip to feel for the hole. I also used fine 
carborundum paper on the shaft. It should disengage by itself or with a 
small pull to start it moving. Also had to clean/lube the light switch, it 
caused binding when reinstalled. The fat bushing is aluminium, don't grab 
onto it too tightly as you can crush it out of round!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;How do I get the diff vacum servo out? I have undone the two screws, 
&gt;&gt;but then I cannot get them out. They are too long and get stuck on
&gt;&gt; the drive shaft. Do I have to take that out too? How do I test the 
&gt;&gt;diff lock? What is the best way to get all the wheels off the ground 
&gt;&gt;so I can test the diff? I hope to get to know my SYNCRO a bit better 
&gt;&gt;so I dont have to ask too many questions, 
&gt;
&gt;Ask away, I've only had mine 4 mos. still getting the bugs out also. Derek 
Drew is very helpful, longterm experience with an '87 and '90, hairraising 
tales of vehicle abuse and adventure. Bye, Tim Smith
