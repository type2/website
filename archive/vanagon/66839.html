Subject:      O2 mixture questions

I have several questions when it comes to adjusting my mixture using the
oxygen sensor.
        1. Do I have to disconnect the sensor with the engine off?  The
           computer will have a memory if I don't.  Does it matter?  Can I
           leave the sensor connected to the computer to read the voltage?

        2. Can I use an analog volt meter to better see the voltage sweeps?
           I was afraid internal resistance of the volt meter would cause
           problems.

I realize I have asked a lot of questions, but I don't want to ruin
anything.  I have a digital meter, but it is very difficult to get a reading
because of the pulsing.  When the engine is running either rich, or lean,
the voltage reads steady.  As soon as I get out of the far reaches of the
scale the pulsing makes reading the voltage difficult.  Any suggestions
would be appreciated.

Thanks,
