Subject: Check Out My Webpage!

Howdy all. After a lot of messing around, I think my web page is ready to be
viewed by all. There is a separate bus page, as well as pictures of me and my
family, and a couple short stories I've written(If you want deep insights into
my psyche). There are also some other nifty links to other listmembers pages
which are even more impressive than mine.
There are also several shots of the list t-shirt, but I haven't gotten the
sticker on yet.
Anyway, the address is:
http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/
There's a spot to e-mail me if you have comments.
Anyway, I hope you like it!
