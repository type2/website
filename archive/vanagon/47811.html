  You mean the evaporator??? Yes there are 2 drains. 1 on each C-piller
  going to the engine compartment. Start there and make sure the drians 
  are clear.

&gt; time.  So, is there some tube through which this condensation is supposed 
&gt; to drain.  The AC on my '87 is in the back because of the pop top.  The 
&gt; water was dripping primarily out of the way back (by the speakers and 
&gt; rear hatch), but also out of the vents .  
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any solutions to this problem?  If I had any passengers, 
&gt; they oculd take a shower in the deluge.
