&gt;The other day I opened my spare gas tank after driving around and it had
&gt;become heated due to the passage of hot radiator air passed it. It sort of
&gt;exploded gasoline all over my shirt and pants. This is the round 1 gallon
&gt;tank I got from JC Whitney that goes in the spare tire up front.
&gt;I am worried that this is not safe and that we need to lay some kind of heat
&gt;barrier material over the spare tire to keep the heat away from the tank. Any
&gt;ideas?

i don't think the barrier stuff will help much. it's the sloshing that excites
the gas and produces the vapor pressure. we used to have the same problem
with those big 'jerry' cans in the army. and it gets worse if you fill them
up too much. admittedly, the heat and sunlight (in the army) didn't help any,
but i still don't think any reflective heat shield will help much for a
car-mounted spare fuel tank.
