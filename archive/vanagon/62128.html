&gt; &gt;      You're partly right: It DOES SEEM like a little too much.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      But it isn't.  3800-3900 in my automatic nets me 65 MPH and finds me
&gt; &gt;      wishing for an overdrive - but the torque probably isn't there.

	Which would be about 59rpm/mph or 592 rpm/10mph
&gt; 
&gt; That means I'm turning 5000+ rpm at 83 mph!  Yikes!

	Nope...it means that, barring slippage, you're turning &lt; 5000rpm
	(about 4900). 

	Regardless, I wouldn't make a habit of all-day travel with a fully 
	laden auto Westfalia at close to redline revs.
