Subject: For Sale:  '82 Diesel Vanagon

Stopped by Burnsville VW on the way home from work this afternoon to check on
a Vanagon Westfalia for the list (sold) but saw the above '82.  Salesman said
that it was traded for the Syncro that they sold last weekend.  It has a
rebuilt diesel with about 2,000 miles on it and only 75,750 on the Vanagon
itself.  Interior looks great, exterior is very good with very little rust.
 It's not in the paper yet but he said it would be in there for $3,400.  He
also said that they would take alot less, like maybe in the $2,600 to $2,800
range.  Their number is (612) 894-3500. I don't remember the salesman's name
and I left his card in the Syncro.  If you want it, let me know.

Usual disclaimers....
