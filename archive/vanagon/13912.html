&gt;About 7 years ago I attended the first SOTO meet down at Deer Park in San
&gt;Diego.  There were these 3 guys from Sacramento, everyone knew who they were
&gt;and knew that they were involved in stealing off of other's cars.  Soon
&gt;enough, parts that were being sold in their swap spot turned out to be
&gt;stolen parts. They were literally dragged and kicked out of the park.
&gt;Sacramento still has that reputation.

Unfortunately, I know _exactly_ who it is you are talking about!  I think
its the same guy that tried to take my bus, and took the one down the street.
Its actually a group of about 8 guys, with 2 guys as the &quot;ringleaders&quot;
and a bunch of others that grip parts for them.

They don't sell anything local, and I don't think anyone would buy
from them.  They do hit the farther away meets, like Pomona and Orange...

&gt;BTW - were you at the CDF station during the big Lexinton fires a few years
&gt;back?  

Nope, the year after.
