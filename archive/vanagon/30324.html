Subject: More on Snow tires: Nokia Hakappelitta 10

This is a Load Range D, 8 ply snow tire.   Our local Nokia dealer can get
them for 100$ per tire (includes mounting only, balancing is 8$ extra).
The size is 185R14.  They are stud-able (although this shop charges 24.95
per tire -- rip-off!).  They are &quot;directional&quot; with a little arrow on the
sidewall that shows direction of rotation  (so be careful when backing
up :-).  I've got these on my Jetta -- they're excellent in snow and,
in spite of the very aggressive tread, are relatively quiet and handle
well on dry roads.  I have no experience with them on a vanagon/bus.

My mechanic &quot;found&quot; these.  When I called this same tire shop a week ago,
they said Nokia doesn't make a reinforced tire in that size.  FWIW,
the shop is STS Tire House in Poughkeepsie, NY (914) 471-2515.  STS would
have to order them right from Nokia, so I imagine any Nokia dealer could do
the same.

Along with the Gislaved Nord Frost II (which I've already ordered), this
makes two reinforced snows (in the correct size) available.  Both of these
are reputed to be excellent tires.
