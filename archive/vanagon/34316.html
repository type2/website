Subject:       I need a vehicle.

My bus needs to much work to be a reliable daily driver any time soon 
and both my other cars are verry close if not already dead.  the time 
has come to break down and buy a reliable, practical, automobile.  I 
would really like to get another bus, vanagon, or beetle.  I need 
something in south east michigan and it can't be a project.  I would 
also concider other makes of cars if there's any out there and  am 
willing to spend up to $3000 if necessary.   Thanks for any leads.
  
  also, for sale.
  '84 chrystler stn wagon  runs 117kmi  $500 obo
  
  
  for sale maybe if i get really desparate and a good offer
  '76 cutlass, great 350 rocket engine, only about 50 miles 
   so far. everything else needs work or is missing
   
both cars would be concidered in excellent shape in the eyes of 
grendel's previous owner.   

thanks.
Ed.
