RE: VW MECHANICS SCHOOL

Michael,

Sorry to post this here on the list...but when I replied to your =
account, the message got bounced back.

You and your friend are welcome to &quot;attend&quot; the mechanics school (even =
after all the grief I gave you last week - you still want to come, eh?). =
I'll send out directions to everyone the beginning of next week.

See you then,.

Ric
