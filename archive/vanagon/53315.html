Subject: Re: 97 EV's

According to Winnebago, (who for some reason seems more willing to give out
information than VW), the automatic transmission version is the only one
that was EPA certified for the US market for 97.  Five-speeds are available
in Canada, but not the US for this reason.  This may apply to the turbo
diesel as well.

There may be another way to get an EV besides as a Winnebago conversion,
however.  Only a few months ago, Country Homes Campers in San Jose, CA told
me that they will still build a conversion vehicle (camper or van) from a
Eurovan chassis.  According to them, they don't do many EV conversions
because the EV chassis is so much more expensive than US minivans.  They
use a shorter version of the EV than Winnebago does.
