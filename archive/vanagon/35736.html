Subject: Re: Which tires?185 or 205

Ken Bowen wonders the inevitable:

&gt;I thought that the 185 or 205 refered to the PROFILE of the tire. I'm not
&gt;sure. I have 195's, I thought they were taller than 185's not wider. What
&gt;do all those numbers mean? r75/195/14??? Now I'm confused.


The large number (185,195,205,etc) refers to the tread width
The middle number (60,65,70,75,etc) refers to the height of the sidewall
as a percentage of the width.
The letter (r,s,z,etc) are speed ratings(how fast can you go before the tire
begins to fly apart)
the small number (13,14,15,etc) refers to the rim size in inches(13&quot;,14&quot;,etc)

In your example above 195/75r 14 your tires have a 195mm wide tread, with the
height(profile) of the tire being 75% of the width or 146.25mm. You can drive
approx 85mph before your tire is suseptable to flying apart, and it is mounted
on 14&quot; rims.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
