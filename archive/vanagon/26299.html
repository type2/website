Subject:       '72 engine questions

While getting more intimate with my engine I found two more 
perplexing thingies.  One seems to be an air outlet on the upper left 
rear of the engine.  it points straight to the left and is not 
connected to anything.  The other is a thin black bar directally above 
the fan housing.  It is spring loaded and actuated by a cable that 
goes straight down. It is resemblent of the accelerator hookup.  If 
any one could tell me what these systems are and how to properly hook 
them up I would apreciate it.
    Thanks.
