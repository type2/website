dealer serviced, records available 
7 seater, clean in and out, ~rust-free
rock dimples on hood, sidelight lense and windshield
good new lowprofile Michelins, drove/handled fine
too much brake fade in quick stops (hey, never driven one before ;&gt;)

strange pat-pat-pat noise from engine?, heard only inside when idling
too high idle, 1500+. both cooling fans on despite mid gauge temps
Bpunk Heidelberg, no A/C, no PW, no PM, no tach.

$11,900 with 3 yr power train
$10,900 without

and sooo willing to deal....
&quot;I got a price in my mind I'd sell it for right now..&quot;
Yeah, and yer mother too.

But probably could be had &lt;$9500CDN range, this is about $6800US.
Not many EVs around, most people here who do buy them buy new.

FYI, and bye,  Tim Smith
