&gt; HI Dave. California Import Parts is a company out of Vancouver, B.C. 
&gt; Their the main supplier of all my parts for my westy. I've had no 
&gt; problems since I've been buying from them. Everyone that works there are 
&gt; vw enthsiasts so they know what their talking about.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 	I am trying to order some heat exchangers for a '79 bus and since 
&gt; &gt; they appear to be a one year only, I am having a hard time finding them.  
&gt; &gt; One place has a &quot;type4 heat exchanger for '79&quot; but it is for the 
&gt; &gt; 411/412.  Will this work on a bus?  (I'm guessing that it won't, but I 
&gt; &gt; wanted to check to see before counting it out.) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	A place called CA Import Parts LTD has the correct exchangers but 
&gt; &gt; they are $40 more apiece than the ones above. If I need to go here has 
&gt; &gt; anyone dealt with them and what do you think about them?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	I am hoping to order these today so that I will have them by the 
&gt; &gt; middle of next week so I can get this bus back together and back on the 
&gt; &gt; road. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any help.
&gt; &gt; dave.
