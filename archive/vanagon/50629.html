*yawn*

In line with the policy of presenting the possibly interested with the
cheaper and rarer (hopefully combined) VWs for sale around the place (how
can I be so full of it so early in the morning?) we present (first time
advertised today)

65 European Ghia Type 3 very nice $1750 OBO (206) 204-9323

That's Seattle...........
