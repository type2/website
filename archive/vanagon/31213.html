Tom,
I do not believe that the recall covered any part of the evaporator housing -
just the duct that runs down the center of the van.  

Your 1987 has 3 bolts on each side that are more-or-less horizontal and mate
with nuts welded in behind the sheetmetal.  Beginning with the 1988 model
year VW changed the mounting arangement on this unit.  These later models
have 3 bolts on each side that are more-or-less vertical and mate with
threads in a bracket.  This newer arangement is much more secure, since the
90 degree bend to fasten to the sheet metal is now part of the metal bracket,
not part of the plastic housing.

I HAD the cracks you mention in my van as well.  While I had my '87's
evaporator down for A/C work, I made a pair of metal brackets and fastened
them to the sheet metal.  Then I cut off the 90 bend in the plastic housing
and re-inforced the plastic with some fiberglass.  Next, I drilled 3 vertical
holes in the housing to fasten it to the bracket that I'd made.  It was a lot
of work, but I figured it was better than having that thing fall down on its
own!

If you're seriously considering this, I could provide more details.
