Subject: '67 Rear Bumper Splash Pans/ Tips

Rusty asks:
Do you still have a good pair of (rust free &amp; relatively straight) splash
pans off of a '67 non-euro bladed rear bumper? I was trying to assemble my
freshly painted and powder coated rear bumper and splash pans over the
weekend. I found that the hole in the splash pans (closest to the center of
the bus/side to side width) don't want to match up to holes in the bumper
brackets.
These two holes are about one to one and one half inches off when I align or
attach the splash pans starting with the inside curved area of the bumper
corners. The splash pans seem to be too far toward the center of the bumper
when aligned as described.
It seems that I may have selected the wrong splash pans for the bumper. I
think that they may be off of a Euro blade or a slightly later model bumper
(eg 68). I know I took them off of one of my misc. thrashed rear bumpers so
I don't know what the difficulty is!

Footnote: Here are a couple of tips if you are planning to redo your earlier
style bumpers.

General:
Unless you are very lucky, you will have to have your bumper blade and the
various over rider pieces straightened (corrected to OEM shape) to some
degree or replaced with aftermarket pieces. Check the fit the pieces to each
other and the bus during or after the &quot;straightening&quot; process and prior to
the priming and painting! This is also is recommended even if using
aftermarket replacement pieces. Make sure that you remove all of the bolts
from the holes prior to the application of the paint or powder coating.
Check for broken bolts. Resign your self to the old tap and die routine if
necessary. Disassemble the bumper pieces prior to primering and painting. Of
course every bumper will need it's own level of attention. Every bus owner
will have their own limits to budget, time, and desire. 

Rear:
Check the fit of your aftermarket over rider uprights. Make sure that you
dry fit the pieces or completely assemble the bumper prior to painting them.
The point is make sure that you have plenty of room to insert the bent
tubing over rider into the hole in the upright. Allow for a build up of
primer and paint. I had to carefully open the holes with a grinding stone on
a drill. It would have been much neater if I didnt have to go back and touch
up the paint.
