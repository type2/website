Subject: front seat armrest fix- ?

help, please...

My driver seat armrest has collapsed.  It appears to have two threaded
bolts(?), &amp; the lower pivot one still works.  The upper one is loosely
attached to the armrest, but I can't remove either pin so I can replace/fix
the problem.  It must be a simple solution- 'guess I'm just dumb.

Also-  is the Transporter/LiMBO the cheapest place to buy a Bentley manuel?
 Would it have helped me figure out my armrest fix?  

Hints appreciated!  I'm the happy recent owner of a '90 Syncro Westy!

Tally-ho  :-)
