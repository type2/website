Subject: Bad Gas for Vanagons

&gt;From time to time, there has been a lot of conversation on various gas 
brands not working well in Vanagons. For those of you that LOVE to keep 
lists, why not keep a record of everyone's experiences with different 
brands that don't seem to work well.
I thought I remembered someone saying that anything with an alcohol blend 
doesn't work well - is that true? If so what brands routinely blend alcohol?
(Apart from Jim Beam :-)
