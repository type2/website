Subject: Re: Eurovan/Winnebago - just

&gt; Does anyone know why VW didn't just have Westphalia do the camper
&gt; thing, like they always have?... (instead of just the pop-top)
&gt; Norman
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

A dealer told me that VW was not going to distribute the Westfalia
version of the full camper in the states because it would cost 35-40K.
The story then was that Winnebago was going to do a pop-top model.
But it sounds now like the VW distributed model is made by Westfalia.
Is that true?  Does anyone know what they are asking for this??
