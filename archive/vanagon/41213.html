Subject: Re: Bay Window Shocks

Well since the Vanagon discussion is going, how about suggestions
for handling improvements on a late bay window.  I have always gone
with OEM Brazil COFAB from Whitney for $12 or so (cheaper than RMMW
BTW for COFAB) but am seeking to improve the '77 handling for the folks.
Are the KYB's worth it as all the mags would have you believe?
How about addition of a rear anti-roll bar (Whitney curse the thought?)
or a full Sway-a-Way heavy duty front and rear roll bar set?

The '77 handles about as well as a bus ever did, recent German BOGE
shocks, new ball joints, and center bushing, and only 88k on it besides,
with C load range tires.  I simply strive to make it handle better
before
turning mom and dad who have been spoiled by years of FWD VW's loose
this summer.  Truly I figure it is more an aerodynamic issue at this
point
than handling but body roll is still fairly excessive in modern terms,
I guess
basically I'd like to make the '77 handle as well as my worn '85 does.
Anybody running any of these mods, I would greatly appreciate feedback.
