 Hi Vanagon Gang,
 We're thinking about going to the Oregon Coast over Thanksgiving (provided
 my vanagon is not still being powered by a Chevy Pickup) and we'd like to
 know if the campgrounds there are still open this time of the year.  Anyone
 know?  Of course, all of this depends upon getting a $49 pulley in the mail.
 It gets tiring waiting for these parts to come in sometimes.
