Subject: Re: My power locks in 95/EV have gone crazy

Robert:

I reported to the list recently an identical experience
with my 95 EV-Winnebago.  The problem was intermittent,
and more common when the weather was wet.

When I took it to the dealer, they could not reproduce
the problem (of course).  They took pity on me, however,
and replaced a microswitch in the driver's door.  (This
is contrary to VW policy - to offer a service or part
under warranty when the problem cannot be observed).

So far, the problem has not recurred. YMMV.
