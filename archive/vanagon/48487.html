Subject: 1984 VW Camper

I'm new to this list, and have a couple of questions that I hope readers will 
be honest with me about.

I have a 1984 VW Camper with about 102,000 miles. It's in great shape, looks 
very nice, no rust at all, and has had the oil changed every 3,000 miles with 
synthetic oil, either Mobil 1 or Castrol Syntec. I could go on and on....I 
really like this vehicle, BUT.......I've heard some real negatives about it 
that I hope someone can give me honest, solid, non-prejudiced advice about. ( 
ha ha...this is even hard for me to do!). 

One friend of mine buys and sells used cars, and has been doing this for 
years. He advises me to sell it ASAP because of all the poor engine qualities 
of this Vanagon based vehicle. such as heads that tend to crack, water cooling 
problems, etc. He mentioned that once the problems start, they are very 
expensive and constant.

I've heard this before from others but have no one personally who has had 
these problems. Could anyone out there comment. I think I can get at least 
$6,500 to $7,500 for this considering the shape it's in. From what I'm 
hearing....selling sounds like the right thing to do.
