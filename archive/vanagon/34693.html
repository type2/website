Subject: diesel starters, Bently question.

Well it looks like I fried the starter in the diesel vanagon.  It was only
the second time I had driven the vehicle.  It was making an &quot;extra&quot; noise
when I cranked it up.  It sounded like a belt rubbing or something.  So of
course I let it run while I attempted to figure out what it was.  That only
occured when I went to move it around the block, and I noticed the wipers
weren't working.  I've owned VW's long enough to suspect the ignition switch
first, especially when faced with mulitple healight/wiper failures.  The
switch was of course stuck in the &quot;start&quot; position, running it the whole time.

Doh!  

Anyway, it turns over but not fast enough to catch (even freshly charged and
throwing on a jump to boot), and it sounds gritty.  So here's my question(s):

1)  It sure looks like there is enough room to get that puppy out of there
without dumping the tranny out first.  For people with the Bently manual (or
for those who've done it already), am I right?  It just looks like two
rather oversize bolts holding it on there, and enough room to snake it out
to the right side.

2)  I am curious as to what the solenoid looking dingus attached to a
bracket under the left side bolt is.  Will it just sit there and behave
while I do the rest?

3)  Once the bolts are out can I really get it out of there without learning
some new German swear words?

A local place can rebuild my starter for $99 with a 5 year warranty.  That
sure sounds like a good deal to me given the uncomfortable &quot;Bosch&quot; position
I've been it before (I usually expect dinner and a movie with such treatment).

I've got to drop the transaxle anyway to do the clutch, but I was hoping to
drive it the two blocks around my house to get to my garage.  It's raining
and cold, and quite a bit of water is flowing under the Vanagon.
