&gt;I wonder if anyone has replaced their ignition switch.  I checked the 
&gt;Bentley, but the informaqtion is somewhat vague:  &quot;to remove&quot;, it notes 
&gt;&quot;first remove steering column lock, then unscrew clamping bolt.&quot;  My 
&gt;question:  what is the steering column lock - is this the lock cylinder 
&gt;or the steering lock housing?
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps the newer Bentley's have a clearer description, my manual is the 
&gt;same year as the van - '84.  Any assistance is appreciated.

Fred,
I recalll doing this in my '87 and after a while of trying to get the switch
out of the housing, discovered that I needed to remove the entire unit from
the steering column.  I'm sorry that I can't be more specific, but I hope
this helps.
