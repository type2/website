Right on about that ear problem.  I don't know how many times I've stopped
at rest stops with ringing in my ears.  A gram of cotton is worth a pound
of cure.  With respect to inside noise, I rigged up a nifty plexiglas wall
just behind the front seats with a hinged door in it.  It cuts out a LOT
of engine/air noise.
