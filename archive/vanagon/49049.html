Subject: useful airline URL


Someone privately e-mailed me asking me to repost the URL for researching
flight info/fares/etc.  My mail bounced back from him, so I'll repost
in the hopes he can somehow receive this.  Thought the rest of you
who missed seeing it the first time might be interested, too.  

There's not much VW content, execpt that this service should allow
you to fly to exciting places and see more cars.  :)
