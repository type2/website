Subject:       urgent propane fill question!

Right.  New Van.  First Big Trip.  need to to fill the propane and 
run into troubles.

After futzing around i finally forced the 3 gals propane into the 
belly tank.  BUT i had to hold that red reset in all the time.  after 
the fill a stream of propane shoots back out the tiny (safety 
relief??) port inside the fill plug.  I panic.  Move the kids out of 
the van (they were along for the ride), push the van to to back of 
the lot, open the 80% valve to bleed of my new 3 gals of propane 
cause the darn stuff keeps squirting out that tiny port.

My question is this:  why did the propane come back out that port???  
it finally stopped flowing after the tank iced up and the pressure 
was reduced.  I closed the 80% valve and now there is some propane 
left cause everything works nice and no leaks.

I know i filled it wrong 'cause i read the damn instructions after my 
near melt-down.  It says to open that 80% FULLY before starting the 
propane.  I didn't do that cause the thought of all that propane 
hissing out scared me.  I assume the propane will flow better with 
that valve all the way open.

Will this happening again (propane spraying out after fuel nozzle 
removed) if I fill it the right way or is there something wrong?

thanks,
dan (can you say FAH-WHOOMP?) houg
