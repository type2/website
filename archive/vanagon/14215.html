Subject: Re: '66 steering

I just went through the &gt;pleasure&lt; of looking for k&amp;l pins,spindles for my
wife's '67. Please let me know if you find source for these buggers. They
are getting (ARE) hard to find. We had to cobble a couple of front ends and
use one Brazilian rebuild kit that my mechanic guru had stashed. The center
pin is a no brainer to find but need to be done properly with the correct
tools etc. Bus Boys advertise rebuilt spindles etc in the catalog.
Availability is another question. Keep me posted on your progress.
&gt;............................................................................
&gt;Went for safety this morn and we failed on a few small items (already fixed)
&gt;and one potentially bigger item: loose king pins.
&gt;Haven't played with them yet (which means they may be tightenable?),
&gt;but what are my options re replacement?  New? Remanufactured? ???
&gt;What can I expect to pay for these animals under the various options?
&gt;Thanks for the help:  I'm almost there:-)
