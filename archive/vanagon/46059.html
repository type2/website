Subject: Phila. area VW pros?
Date: Sun, 7 Jul 1996 18:04:05 -0400 (EDT)

We are (we hope) about to buy a 1965 Bus which will
be in need of some body work and a new paint job.  This
is not work we are prepared to do ourselves - so we'd like 
to know if anyone out there is aware of any professionals
in the Philadelphia area who specialize in such restorative
work. We've not owned a VW since we've lived in this area
so we don't know of anyone.

So.... if anyone knows of a good shop within a few hours from 
Philadelphia - please let us know.

Thanks.


Stephanie
