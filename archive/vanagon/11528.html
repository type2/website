Subject: Re: Bleeding clutch??

&gt;Anyone care to decribe how &quot;easy&quot; it is to bleed the clutch lines
&gt;in an '84 Vanagon?  Bently says to pressurize the system (from the

I've done it on an '85 van and again yesterday on an '87 Syncro. If memory 
serves, the regular van had to be bled from underneath, since the bleed 
screw is high up on the slave cyl. near the body. The Syncro was 2&quot; lower 
due to the subframe, and was a real snap to do from the engine ompartment. 
        Either way...  get a 7 mm. box wrench, WD-40/penetrating oil, some 
plastic tubing to slip over the bleed screw and a small pop bottle. Soak the 
screw, scrape the rust aside, and put the box wrench on. Wriggle it all the 
way on, then open the screw, maybe a 1/4 turn. Force the plastic tubing over 
the bleed screw, (keep the wrench in place), and put the other end deep into 
the pop bottle, wedged somewhere secure. Go up front and pump away smoothly 
etc. This is a one person deal BTW!
        Having the bleed screw only slightly open stops the system from 
sucking back air, since it's easier to pull in fresh fluid from the 
reservoir. When the fluid level hits low, then start topping up. You'll get 
about 3/4 bottle (400cc) of brown fluid before it starts clearing. It won't 
get crystal clear unless you push another bottle of fluid through. Pressure 
purging probably works better, but this works fine. My clutch feels way 
better, and doesn't 'stiffen up' due to the H2O in the fluid freezing up in 
the cold weather, going to -28C tonight.  Brrr.  bye tim s.
