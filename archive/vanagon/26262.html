&gt;Opal helped me find a leak i never knew existed. somewhere on the
&gt;front left
&gt;site..prolly the seal. i'm looking into replacing the seal but what
&gt;can i do

Funny

We had some drenching rain the past couple of days here in Connecticut.  I
have a similiar leak on the left side of my 87' Syncro.  I replaced the
rubber seal approximately 6 months ago.  It seemed to work for a while but
its beginning to leak again.  Can water enter the inside of the van through
the fresh air vent??  Anyone else experience a similiar problem to ours??  I
don't think its coming from the windshield seal.
