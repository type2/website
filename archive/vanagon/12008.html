&gt;So is there any remedy for that? Or is this normal and nothing I should
&gt;worry about? I'm still on the steep part of my learning curve regarding

what i used to do on my 71 and 73 bus was to clean the cover really good, and
smear some thick axle/bearing grease around the cover where the gasket fits.
this would hold the gasket in place while i positioned the cover on the head.
i also would coat the gasket-head surface of the gasket with the same grease.
i'm not sure where i got the idea, but the theory is that the grease keeps
things in place and keeps the oil from leaking out long enough for the gasket
to heat up and swell up to its 'normal' size. it always worked for me.

&gt;I'm also in the process installing an ammeter and I am wondering what the
&gt;best way is to run cables from the engine compartment all the way to the
&gt;dashboard and back. Under the carpet? Behind the cabinets?

i would run the big mutha wires under the bus, with the bundle of other wires
already running there. you can come up into the dash area through the floor of
the bus, near the heater tube. in fact, as i recall ... there is enough room
in the floor behind those front kick-panels for some wires. i remember running
something up through there, and i don't think i had to drill a hole. i DID
have to take that big skid-plate off the bottom of the bus to run the wires
through there, though. :)
