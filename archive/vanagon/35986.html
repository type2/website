Subject: Timing

Is it ok to static time my fuel injected '77 westy as explained in the Muir
book?  He mentioned something about timing the later fuel injected models
with a strobe.  I would prefer to static time it if it is ok to do so.
Also, my Muir book only covers models up to 1973 (mines a 1977).  Is there
a more recent edition available that covers the late 1970s and if there is,
are the changes in it significant (should I buy it?).  The edition I own
is a family heirloom, passed to from father to son.
Thanks,
Brett
