Subject: Re: Updated oil pressure switch? (wasserboxer)

In a message dated 96-02-16 14:10:27 EST, you write:

&gt; Also, I was considering seeing about
&gt;&gt;replacing the switch with one that also has pressure sending capability
&gt;&gt;for a oil pressure gauge. Any ideas or experience on this?
&gt;
&gt;I've heard of someone replacing the switch under the left head with a
&gt;fitting, a short tube to remote mount the switch, and a 'T' so that the
&gt;switch and the new sensor could both be used.  I haven't seen this myself,
so
&gt;I can't vouch for it's reliability.  Any time you add stuff like this on,
&gt;there's increased likelyhood of leaks.
&gt;
I've done just this.  I installed a duel sensing sending unit beneath the
left head.  I had to use teflon tape to seal the leaks.  I used plummers
5/16th piping to move the new senor away from the head about 3&quot; and the a 90o
turn down.  The new sensor was aftermarket and if about 2&quot; in diamer and 3&quot;
high, thus not fitting in the same location of the original sending unit.  I
bought and electric duel sending unit so I wouldn't have to mess witht the
thin oil pressure tube running the length of the van to the guage in the
dashboard.  I have found it to be a savior to diagnose engine pressure
problems.  Especially after I rebuilt my engine, it was nice to know what the
engine was doing.
