&gt; I just bought and '87 Synchro, and an outboard front CV boot let go the

&gt; axles and repacking the joints.  What's the best CV boot available, and
&gt; where can I get them?  Is there a split boot available (for a temporary
&gt; measure)?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, where's a good place to get VW and Vanagon parts in the Boston
&gt; area?
&gt; 
&gt; Was I surprised when I did a Net search for &quot;Vanagon&quot; and found this
&gt; mailing list.   Now I have something to look forward to when I check my
&gt; e-mail!

I changed a boot on my 94 syncro and bought an original boot from my VW 
dealer. It was made in an hard glossy kind of plastic. Not all like the 
old ones, really soft rubber. I wonder if it is some kind of 
polyuretane? I also bought the special pliers to crimp on the steel 
clips on the both end on the boot. I can tell you soon if it is better 
than the soft ones.
