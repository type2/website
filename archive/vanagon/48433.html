Subject: More on the Canadian Tire van tent
Date: Sat, 17 Aug 1996 07:16:03 -0400 (EDT)

I have tried all week to find one of these tents in stock to have a look
at with no luck.  So I still don't know much more about it than what I can
see in the add picture and some specs in the catalogue at one of the
stores.  I have ordered one and will post more news about this tent when I
get it.  The sale ends today Saturday August 17th so if anyone else is
interested you better get moving now.  Facts I know so far are that it's
made from 190T breathable nylon taffeta with a plastic tarp like floor. 
There are two zippered windows.  Opening with awning in front and opening
to van in the back.  It is 8.5' x 8.5' x 88&quot;  The poles are sectional with
elastic to keep the sections together.  Tent is made by &quot;CampMate&quot; 
Canadian Tire part #76-5181-8  That's it for now

Cheers

Frank
