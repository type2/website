Subject: RE: odd brick


&gt;Saw one of these vans, a Mexican Caravelle,
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;The body is straight out of 1978, kind ofcool looking with that black thing 
up front.
&gt;
&gt;You can buy them today in Mexico brand new for less than US$10,000 with
&gt;the peso the way it is - the trick is just getting them in (I've checked
&gt;it out, and it's heinous to do legit.)  The driver of this one was a US
&gt;citizen with a permanent residency permit in Mexico, and the van had
&gt;plates from Guerrero.  He says they just wave him through at the border,
&gt;and he's had it here for up to six months at a time (has homes both here
&gt;and there.)
&gt;
&gt;I don't know how much his permanent resident status figures into it, but
&gt;it seems like the trick is basically just to keep the registration up to
&gt;date in Mexico and you can drive it indefinitely here.  If you had a
&gt;buddy in Mexico to act as your front for the purchase and registration
&gt;(wonder what the insurance requirements are there?) you might be able to
&gt;pull it off...


Never tried it, but I suspect that insurance requirements would quickly pale
next to the baksheesh requirements of your &quot;buddy&quot;, once he realized that
he had you by the short ones and could get you thrown in jail in either of
two countries if you weren't *real* nice to him. Unless he was your brother
or something, I'd be a little cautious if I were you.
