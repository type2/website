Subject: Re: awnings, what I've learned

&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;How about attaching them to something secured by the wheels.  I'm picturing a
&gt;couple of pieces of wood or something that you drive the van onto, that
&gt;extends out away from the passenger side of the van.  Then attach the pole to
&gt;the wood.  
&gt;
&gt; Interesting thought. I was thinking of attaching (bolting) some sort of
tab under the bus that stuck out flush with the body. It would be very small
so you wouldn't notice it much, just big enough to be able to attach the
awning post.
