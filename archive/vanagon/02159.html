Subject: Radial Spoke Trip

There is a reason that the Harleys go to Sturgis, SD each year and not just 
on a trip together.  Given the equal geographical diversity of this group 
how about 4 to 6 trips that converge at an agreed time and place.  Folks 
wanting longer trips could join an outbound leg that came from another 
direction.  How about:

Seattle                                         Philadelphia

                               ?


Los Angeles                                     Atlanta

as the starting points, converging on Fort Collins, CO or St. Louis MO.
