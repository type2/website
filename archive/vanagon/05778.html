Subject: Camper/ pop top conversion

Hi, van' fans,
 
I stopped at a local VW place to get filters &amp; we got to talking. It seems that
one of the guys as a kind of pop top which is full size, looks like the Westy
top, but does not hinge. It rises straight up. The cool thing is that the top
was designed as a dealer conversion for the Transporter and does not need the
body modifications (reinforcements) that the archives mention. He says that the
only change is a hole nibbled in the roof.
 
Does anybody out there have one of these? The shop guy said there were a lot of
these done out in CA. He does not know the name. I just got back from the shop,
and if youse all don't say that it sucks, I'll probably take a look at it maybe
next week.
 
The shop guy also has some camper interiors that he sort of wants to clear out.
What would be a reasonable offer for the stove/sink/fridge stuff? What should I
be careful of? I know I won't be able to test the fridge before buying.
 
(OK, OF what should I be careful?)
 
Thanks a lot!
 
J. David
