What I need is a new gas valve for one of the burners. It is permanently 
locked, even when pushed in.
Also, any ideas on overriding that ceramic fuse setup for the 12 volt 
fridge? Mine burnt out.Not the fuse,the whole fuse outlet just scorched. 
Right now I have the whole sink/stove/fridge out to access the body panel 
for some minor rust work in the body seam.
Any Ideas? I never had any of this stuff ripped out before although I do 
have the factory manual.
