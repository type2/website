&gt; There is a Weekender which is NOT a half assed Westy.  It is a different 
&gt; purpose vehicle.  Great for overnights or picnics.  Not meant for 
&gt; vacation.  The Weekender is built on the regular body MV seven 
&gt; passenger.

Hehe, whoops, didn't mean to offend anyone.  :)  I just remember
thinking that when my mom and I were looking at them a few years ago.
We asked to see a Eurovan Westfalia camper and they showed us the
Weekender.  &quot;Where's the fridge?&quot; I ask.  Mr. Salesman shows me a little
shoebox Kooltron that goes under the seat.  Hmmm... no stove or propane
tank either.  I guess the weekender does have it's &quot;purpose&quot; but I was a
little disappointed that it was all Westfalia had to offer as a camper.
