&gt;&gt;&gt;much less two in the same issue).  I write the ads exactly as they 
&gt;&gt;&gt;appeared in the Auto-Trader.  The first one says &quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  I write 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  He responds &quot;What makes it so rare?&quot;  How the hell do I 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Calm down.  You were not being flamed!  We are merely commenting on
&gt;&gt;the claim of the advertiser that he has some rare item, which really 
&gt;isn't
&gt;&gt;so rare.   Its kinda like talking back to the TV (television, not 
&gt;transvestite-
&gt;&gt;dad would slap me for talking back)
&gt;&gt;

&gt;Never thought I was being flamed and I think you miss the point of my 
&gt;resonse.  Go back to the original message where the request was made 
&gt;&quot;Does anyone know anyone that has a pre-62 double door panel for sale at 
&gt;a reasonable price.&quot;  I responded to that request with two ads I'd just 
&gt;seen that day in the Texas Auto-Trader (which I doubt is available in 
&gt;Minnesota).  The first vehicle is knocked because the owner thinks its 
&gt;rare and the second one because the wheel arches need to be replaced.  
&gt;The ad said nothing about only perfect restorations being considered or 
&gt;the owner must have the same definition of rarity that the other guy 
&gt;has.  The ads were not edited by me, I posted them just as they 
&gt;appeared.  If the guy has questions about why the vehicle is rare, the 
&gt;phone number is there so he can talk to the owner.  The same thing 
&gt;applies to the second vehicle,  I don't know for sure what the owner 
&gt;means by less motor (could be the engine is out and needs repair or 
&gt;could be its a 1200 which is less than a 1600 but then the ad should 
&gt;have read more motor):)  Nor do I know if new tranny means NOS, rebuilt 
&gt;or fresh from the wrecking yard. 
&gt;     Maybe these vehicles are a dime a dozen in some parts of the 
&gt;country but I've lived in the snow belt and know that any 1960 vehicle 
&gt;is hard to come by up there.  Texas does not use salt on the roads so 
&gt;most vehicles here are not the rust heaps seen in areas that use it.  My 
&gt;point is that if you are looking for a particular vehicle and someone 
&gt;gives you a lead on it, don't just give a flippant response knocking the 
&gt;leads, especially if the leads meet the criteria stated in your post.

There is entirely too much time being spent on this subject.  I am sorry if
&lt;&lt;ANYONE&gt;&gt; took offense to the things I said.  Crap man, I was just
responding.  As I said before it was not personal at all.  I will make sure
that I don't post anything else to this list that could in &lt;&lt;ANY&gt;&gt; possible
way be misconstrued as personal attack.

A simple I don't know would have sufficed when I asked what made it rare.  I
don't know that you hadn't called it or anything.  Like I said enough of this.
