Subject: Re: '61 crew cab value

&gt;A '62 Crew sold here (Springfield, MO) two years ago for around $3000.  
&gt;The original asking price was $5300 and it took a year for the price to 
&gt;fall.  The truck was in beautiful shape.  The only problem was a little 
&gt;returning rust in one rocker.  Wish I had bought it.  They are rare, and 
&gt;becoming more and more desirable, so that price *may* not be out of line.

Thanks for the info, Bob.  I'll wait to see what the VW shop says about
mechanical condition and follow up here with more info.
