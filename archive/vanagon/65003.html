Listees,

  I deal with Python, I do have to deal with a distributer in the middle
but I have alot of inside help with my dist.  I'ver not followed the
Thread on this so pardon me if I cover something that's allready been
covered.

  Python has done good work from what I've seen.  The product line is
very extensive.  They rebuild injectors, fuel pumps, baro sensors and
Much more.  The do German as well as Japanese injection and computers
too.

  The Rebuilt ECU's I offered to the list a few weeks ago have come from
Python.  I have 5 Ecu's out on the road at present with no problems
reported.

  If anyone wants to contact me because they have questions etc about
Python feel free.  I met a Rep from Python a few weeks ago and got some
insight on the company too.

  Kyle
