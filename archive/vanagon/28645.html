&gt;Until I can predict exactly what will happen in my next crash, I'll
&gt;keep wearing the belts-- the odds are MUCH more in my favor.
&gt;
&gt;

I personally wouldn't be here today if not for seat belts.  A drunk driver
ran a red light one night in San Antonio in '83, hit me from the front at
about a 30 degree angle (almost head-on), his lights were off, etc., and I
didn't even see him coming.  The length of the engine compartment from the
windshield to the front bumper was about 4 feet after the crash, the engine
went downward and back, the door on the passenger's side was so mangled that
the passenger had to get out my side...she had a broken arm, I had a scratch
on one knee (we both wore seat belts).  The drunk driver of the other car was
wearing his belt, and didn't get a scratch.  His passenger was not, and is
paralyzed from the waist down.

I'll wear 'em every time, and the van doesn't move until all passengers are
buckled up, too.

Happy ending - the insurance money from that wreck allowed me to buy my '84
Jetta _brand new_.  The rest is VW history!
