&gt;i did just call about some details...and it was basically the same old:
&gt;used the diesel bell housing, starter, oil pan, etc....but for you syncro nuts, you 
&gt;would be interested to know that he said that he had to order a special gas tank from 
&gt;germany to make it work...(snip)

Bullseye-thats the trick!

My fuzzy brain recalls someone saying you could not do a diesel bellhousing in a syncro, 
and I stopped there when evaluating a VW gas engine for syncro transplant potential. I 
should have perservered, sounds like the actual problem is fuel tank interference. The 
special tank he refers to might be one produced for the diesel syncros that were 
available in Germany, the tank would have been engineered around the diesel bellhousing, 
starter, etc. It all makes sense now... 

Incidently, I note that the new Porsche Boxster will be powered by a 204 HP
flat six that is watercooled....arriving soon at a junkyard near you? 

And, ah, Patrick, thats &quot;Syncronauts&quot;, not &quot;Syncro nuts&quot;, please allow us a little 
dignity with our affliction! ;-)
