&gt;&gt; I see dulpicate postings several times a day - mostly together, but
&gt;&gt; sometimes separated by several other postings.  Is this something any of you 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; are experiencing or is just me?

Are the duplicate postings for messages which you have participated in the
discussion?  Some readers when generating a reply will direct copies to BOTH
the list and the original sender, thus you'd get both the list copy AND the
private e-mail copy.  Check out the header stuff on the messages and see if
you are listed individually in addition to the vanagon list address.  Just a
possibility.
