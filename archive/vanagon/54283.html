Subject: Re: Mexican vehicles --HOW ABOUT SOUTH AFRICAN VANAGONS?

&gt;         This relates to the discussions about importing vehicles, &gt;mostly buses from Canada. I saw two brand new Mexican beetles today in &gt;Loxley, AL (10 miles east of Mobile). From various lists I have been &gt;led to believe that it can't be done, but there they were! 
&gt;If he can get beetles, how about buses? What's available in Mexico? 

Hi All,

I've been reading about importing Vanagons every since I found out that
they are still being manufactured in South Africa.  How about a BRAND
NEW Vanagon with a dependable cast-iron block 5-cylinder motor (with no
problematic heads), 21 gallon (85L) gas tank, 15&quot; alloy wheels, power
remote side mirrors, plastic bumpers, and a factory 5-speed tranny?  Air
condition?--you got it!
     Since the Vanagon already met Fed safety/crash requirements and the
Audi 5-cylinder also meets the EPA regs--would it be possible to bring
these into the US?  Even parts of them would be nice--like a nice new
rust free, dent free body with a 5-speed tranny.
     Is it even remotely possible/economically feasible?
     If you have not seen these yourself look up the South African VW
web sites and begin lusting after a new Vanagon:

Having new Vanagon dreams,

PS  A friend of mine (and fellow Van fan) saw a TV show this weekend
showing the arrival of the British Royal Yacht to South Africa.  There
was a long string of white Vanagons waiting to transport members of the
Royal Family.
