Subject: Hippies and Rednecks~Jerome Jamboree!!!

A discussion of &quot;Hippies and Rednecks shouldn't ever camp together&quot; on the
Vanagon list...

Perfect time to remind you all that the Arizona Bus Club's Jerome Jamboree
is coming up in mid-September. To be held in Jerome, Arizona &lt; approx.
midstate&gt;. At this event you will see the Lamb camping with the Wolves, even
waterboxers and aircooleds! We have had nine day old babies, 89 year old bay
window owners, Deady Drummers, Dwight Yoakum fans, junkyard owners and brain
surgeons all at the same event. &lt;seriously&gt;
We even put up with the boom box crowd for about five minutes and then we
show them the *original* meaning of &quot;slammed to the ground.&quot;

Besides, I wonder if anyone has ever seen a picture of John Kyte &lt;from type2
list&gt; and I camping? Whew, a couple of longhaired cowboys. (OK, I confess I
cut mine) What ever happened to &quot;Country Rock&quot; anyway???

I won't continue the thread of the religion teasing but I will leave you
with an ascii &quot;Shiite&quot; Mickey Mouse  8(=o)

For more information regarding the Jerome Jamboree or &quot;new religion&quot; contact
myself via email or Mr. Jon Stanton, Pres. of AZ Bus Club at (602)877-8662
or Jerry Jess at (602) 867-7672.
