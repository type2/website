Subject: sorry for the post to the list

Sorry about that.  The .sig message supposed to go to the guru and 
not to the list.

This is probably as good a time as any to announce my plans for vacation.
I will be on vacation from Saturday, July 30 until Sunday August 21st.  
I will bring my modem, but I won't get connected very often.
I have asked (volunteered?) Joel (everyone thinks he runs this list 
anyway....) to help out with list problems while I'm away.

He will be able to add and delete people, and error messages will be 
routed to him. He can change the welcome messages and alias files and 
also the ignore files (the unwanted and dispicable types who are 
excluded from our elite discussion [currently this file is empty :-)])

During that period of time, you should address list questions to him.  
If he gets run over by a Syncro, then hopefully he'll let the system 
managers at lenti.med. know what happened and they'll have to straighten 
out who his successor is.  Hopefully I'll dial in at least once a week 
to make sure there are no explosions or such.

Thanks for your understanding and courtesy in not demanding too much of 
him. (he's only a machine after all...&lt;grin&gt;).
