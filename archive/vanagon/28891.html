Rabbits are &quot;modern&quot; enough that the voltage regulator under discussion is
probably a &quot;3 terminal&quot; device integrated circuit, probably a thin flat
rectangle about 1/2&quot; square and about 1/8&quot; thick (Possibly with a metal tab at
one end) and with  3 leads coming out the opposit end.  I'd expect to see it
screwed to the circuit board of the instrument cluster.
