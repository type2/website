Subject: Re: Emissions Comparison: Gas/Diesel


&gt; Can anyone tell me which engine would do better in an emissions test, a
&gt; diesel (from vanagon) or the equilivant gas engine from a jetta/gulf...
&gt; ect. I would imagine the gas would do better, but I really don't know too
&gt; much about diesels. Also, are testing procedures the same for the two.

My '85 Jetta diesel with ~ 280k easily passed &quot;AirScare&quot; testing in 
BC a few years ago, with less than 10% of allowable readings on the 
tests. This was the same engine as the Vanagon, including solid 
lifters.
