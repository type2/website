Subject: Re: preventing theft


	The '91 Westfalia I just acquired has an ignition kill device 
	installed which requires pulling up on the directional signal
	wand while starting... a bit funky, but effective even if the 
	key is in the ignition.

	Several of my my long gone VWs and Volvos had a separate switch 
	under the dash as part of my highenergy ignition mods which made
	starting...interesting...by anyone unfamiliar with the procedure
	of 1/switch on, 2/crank.
