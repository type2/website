&gt;&gt;&gt;Reading some of the posts, I get the idea the people go mudslinging in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;syncros.  Is a syncros a real 4X4 kind of vehicle, like the toyata 4wd pu I
&gt;&gt;&gt;had?  I thought it was 4wd in the same sense as my dad's subaru legacy is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;4wd, i.e. better on road traction, no jumping logs and boulders.
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In most situations the Syncro's off-road capability lies between the two.
&gt;&gt; Much closer to the 4x4 truck capability than the Legacy's.  In some
&gt;&gt;situations, the Syncro makes a more capable off-roader than the Toyota 4x4
&gt;&gt;you mention.

&gt;Hello everyone!
&gt;     The Syncro has ample ground clearence.   Its limiting factors are,
&gt;front and rear over hang, only 95 hp and exposed exhaust system.  I have
&gt;driven my Syncro off road alot.  It has better traction ability than my '90
&gt;S-10 blazer.  I have crawled over rocks and logs, through deep mud, forded
&gt;shallow streams, climbed steep grades and buried  it up to the frame in mud.

I wonder how deep you can ford with these things. Aren't the air intakes
approximately 5 feet off the ground? Does ignition get flooded out 1st?

&gt;If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
&gt;baffle them with bull sh*t.
