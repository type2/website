My recall experience was pleasant, surprisingly.  I took my
EV into the dealer for the first time after moving to
Asheville for a 4-wheel alignment and after entering my VIN
into their computer, THEY told me I needed to get the
steering column bolt recall work performed.  They oprdered
the parts, then scheduled me an appontment and got it done
pronto.  Note, though that I didn;t say VWoA had done all
the recalls they SHOULD...  ANy EVers run out of gas on a
highly trafficked(sp?) freeway because of malfunctioning
gauges yet?
