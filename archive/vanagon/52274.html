Derek,

My '91 has power door locks.  Four (4) brass, spring loaded  connectors on
the door (like pins).  System only works when closed.  If the sliding door
is open and we lock the front doors the sliding door will lock when it is
closed.  Works good because you can't lock the door open.  Please let me
know if you need more info.

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone out here have power door locks? If so, how is the wire to the
&gt; sliding door routed? I am installing  an aftermarket kit and am stumped
at
&gt; how to do a sano installation, all the other doors have hinges so this is
not
&gt; a problem. Is there slack in the wire when the door is open or ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
