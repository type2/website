          By the way, I can't see my dash through my steering wheel either. 
           At 6'3&quot; and over 300 lbs. I have trouble fastening my seatbelt 
          too.  I don't have a swivel under the driver's side and even with 
          the seat as far back as it goes my legs get cramped on long 
          trips.  There was more driver room in my '57 Beetle.
          
          I'm contemplating being surgically shortened to accomadate my 
          Westy better.  
          
     Gary-
     
     There's another hope.  Being 67 years of age, my Dad reports that he's 
     shrunk from his once 6'0&quot; to a more verticaly-challenged 5'10&quot;.
     
     BTW, my first Beetle, a '58, seemed roomy too, but I've put on 80 
     pounds since then (you haven't always been 300 have you?)
