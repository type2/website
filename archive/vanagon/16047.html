Subject: Re: Syncro Air Filter

&gt;I have been using the big air filter (part # 25129620B) which goes 
&gt;for $136 CDN (just phoned for the latest price).  My dealer, who used 
&gt;to stock these no longer do so.  They have to be ordered from 
&gt;Toronto.

I bought a little pile of these expensive filters four years ago figuring
that they would get really expensive and not available any more.

&gt;The kicker is this, after 5 years they told me that the regular 
&gt;Vanagon air filter also fits.  Apparantly it is a round cylinder 
&gt;versus the oval jobbie I have in there now.  The price is $20.38 CDN.  
&gt;They said that the Syncro filter is used only for extremely dusty 
&gt;conditions.  

There is no reason to use a syncro air filter except in the dusty regions of
southwest.

I live in the northeast

This means I am...

..uh...

..an idiot with a pile of needlessly expensive filters in the attick? Oh
well, I think I only paid about $50 each or them back when so at least it
seems I am beating inflation!

&gt;I have only put in 2 filters in 5 years... 2 year service life.  Even 
&gt;after 2 years the filter is very clean.... I don't do much dirt road, 
&gt;and maybe because the air intake is so high in the rear it doesn't 
&gt;get much dust (?).  

I believe than a Vanagon Syncro air filter is virtually a
life-of-the-vehicle kind of thing where you live.
