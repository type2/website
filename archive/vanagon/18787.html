The red overtemp light works off two inputs, either a true overtemp situation
which you would also see on your temp guage or a low coolant situation.  In 
the coolant reservoir, not the overflow tank, is a sensor that detects the 
presence of coolant through it's conductivity.  If the coolant level falls 
low enough (say leaky heads/gaskets) the contacts will be momentarily in air
and will turn on the overtemp led/light indicating loss of coolant.  As the 
coolant level recedes the contacts are in air more of the time and the 
indicator will stay on more of the time.  To troubleshoot the critter, first
check the coolant level in the coolant reservoir, not the overflow tank.  If
it's not absolutely full to the top, fill it up with water.  Shouldn't take
more than a couple of cups.  If it's seriously low AND there's coolant in the
overflow tank then the $$valve$$ cap is not allowing coolant return from 
the overflow back into the  coolant reservoir as the operating temps change.
Replace the cap, fill system and try again.  You might as well remove the
connector from the coolant level detector and ensure that the indicator led
comes on and stays on.  Removal and replacement several times will clean up
the contact surfaces a bit and give you a bit more time between such trouble
shooting events as this.

Gas struts suck big time.  Use a finely crafted Schwarzwalder churman tail
gate elevating structure instead.  (broomstick with rubber cane tip). 

In a pinch you can do battle over the creek with Friar Tuck, whack them pesky
skunks, lean on it, or use it to poke down the frisbee from recalcritant trees.

You cannot however stir the molten magnesium without seriously shortening the
life of the tool.

There are available some super power gas struts but alas none have the right 
&quot;tips&quot; for the Vanagoing.  VW gets muchodinero for a pair of new ones.
