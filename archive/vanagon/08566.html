Does this mean that the more knobs, plug in devices, light fixtures
monitors, gauges, trim we have on our busses the more control oriented we
are? Personally, I prefer to keep the interior stock while adding only
those items that will help me know how the engine is performing;does this
mean that I seek an underlying order to all things cosmic, and am
inherently conservative; and what about the guy who puts in things like
fuel consumption monitors, 80 watt speakers, chrome trim etc; or the
person who redecorates the interior in flannel :) ?
