Subject: problems with JACK for '85 vanagon

All,

Has anyone experienced problems with their jack?  Well, it's not exactly 
the jack; rather, the slot where the jack slides into has become bent, 
making it VERY difficult to get the jack to stand up straight.

Are there other types of jacks available that might work, and if so, how, 
and where might they be gotten?

Thanks a bunch,

David
