&gt;So long friends.  I am out of here, mainly because I can't handle the
&gt;volume of individual emails posted to this listserve.  Other listserves
&gt;that I am on combine all mails received within 8-16 hours on a single
&gt;message.  I just returned from four days out of town and there were over
&gt;250 individual mailings from this listserve.  Sorry, I can't handle it.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck to everyone, and have fun!!

You can have the Vanagon list send you digests by sending the message

     set vanagon digest

to listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu after you've subscribed.
