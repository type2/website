Subject: Advice: Would this be a wise purchase?

&gt;It's a 67 standard microbus, complete, walk-thru, small amount of surface
rust 
&gt;in problem areas only (floorboards, etc.), body straight, except for
crinkles 
&gt;on LH side/rear, due to its skidding on its side.  (it sounds worse than it 
&gt;actually looks!)

Hmmmm.  Its sorta quite easy to bend or *twist* (urk!) a bus after an
accident like this and they are *very* hard to get straight again because of
the way they are built with 'enclosed boxes' in the rear end  (not saying it
can't be done but it will require a competent professional with an
appropriate jig and $$$ to get it close.....).  

One rough way to judge whether it has been *twisted* is to check the gaps
around the rear (engine and cargo) hatches - if they are not a regular width
(i.e., perhaps run from wide at the top to narrower at the bottom) something
is bent big time.  

That's not to say you can't live with it - it depends on whether you're
looking at it with a view to transport or restoration or whatever...
