Subject: Re: for Friday (Swivel Seat Fix)


&gt; I knew about the oil filler extension tube, the stove cover/drainboard, and
&gt; the swivelling front seats.  What I want to know is, where do you store the
&gt; gorilla required to swivel the dang things?!?

Only a small gorilla needed...

I learned after doing the 2nd seat in our '88 &amp;  discovered the 
trick: 

1. Remove the seat from the tracks.
2. Remove the 4 bolts holding the swivel plate. Remove the plate, 
turning 90 deg to pull the lever through the slot in the seat mount.
3. Clean all the old grease off. I spent about an hour on each seat 
doing this - the factory grease turns to sticky, gummy stuff after a 
while.
4. Coast the nylon sliders on the swivel piece with fresh grease &amp; 
re-install.
5. Here's the trick: Only tighten the 4 nuts until the swivel doesn't 
wobble - they are nylon nuts &amp; won't come loose.
6. Reinstall the seat (after cleaning &amp; regreasing rails) &amp; you're 
done.

In mine, I did the passenger seat first, &amp; tightened the nuts too 
much, and it's way too stiff. The driver seat is perfect - easy to 
swivel and doesn't have any play in it when driving.
