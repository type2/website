Subject:       Linear deterioration of vans?

Hi Folks--
This is kinda an odd question and one that may arouse much 
speculation, but that's okay.  I'm looking at buying an '87 Westy, 
well maintained but with 160,000 miles.  The usual has been replaced:
water pump
cv joints
currently needs exhaust but not head gaskets

My question is this:  Is there any parts that will be ready for 
replacement just as a straight function of high miles-- regardless of 
it being well-maintained?  Clutch? Brakes? Tranny? Rings?
