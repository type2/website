Our family (being the crazy people we are) catch mice in the basement in
Have-a-Heart traps.  (Live traps.)  One Sunday, the kids wanted to take the
mouse to church to show their friends before turning it loose.  All went well
until someone tilted the trap too far to the side, the door opened,  and the
mouse escaped.   It disappeared into the van.  We went to Pizza Hut for lunch
and baited the trap with cheese.  After lunch--- still no mouse.  So I went
grocery shopping by myself, and as I'm returning down the interstate at
65mph, he reappears and begins running beneath my feet.  I scream, swerve,
but manage to make it home in one piece.  That night we set the trap again
and by the next morning caught the little culprit.  After a nice meal of
peanut butter and crackers, then  visiting church, Pizza Hut, and the grocery
store, he headed back into the woods.   No wonder the mice like our house!
