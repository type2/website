&gt; Jim!:  Are you trying to tell us that the rest areas in the East
&gt; ask you to shower and wash your hair with COLD running water!???

No offense to denizens of the Eastern US, but I must admit that the
roads in that part of the country suck, and the rest areas beside
these well-worn roads look like something out of a cheap horror movie.

Maybe, having learned to drive in the Pacific Northwest, where (until
lately) there's been little traffic to wear down the interstates, I've
been spoiled by roads that are generally free of potholes, ruts, 
workhorses, orange barrels, etc.  

Back to the rest, areas, now.  I often felt uncomfortable entering
rest areas in the Indiana/Illinois/Ohio area.  Was it the graffiti-
sprayed walls?  The phones with the recievers ripped out and missing?
The stainless steel mirrors sanded dull in an attempt to grind out
someone's amateur etching attempt?  Maybe it was the sinks that sometimes
had running water, or the stopped-up and overflowing toilets?  The feeling
that I needed to wash my shoes before having them touch the carpet of
my car?

I don't know.  But I do know that rest areas in the West are more like
campgrounds;  people are generally friendly, the facilities are clean 
and in good repair, they're well lighted, and don't give me the creeps
when I roll in at 1AM.

Maybe it's just culture shock.
