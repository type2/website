Subject:      source for VDO stuff?

Looking for VDO-150752: Pressure Adapter Hose Kit as found on
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbvdo.htm

I've heard some negative reviews of service from Bus Boys on
the type2 list.  Where's another good place to get this?  Or can
someone refute what's been said with an example of good service from
Bus Boys?

BTW, Bus Depot couldn't get this part.  I ordered the other stuff
from Ron (sending unit and oil pressure gauge).
