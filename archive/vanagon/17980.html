&gt; 
&gt; In my on-going attempt to try to get a Northeast and or East Coast
&gt; gathering this summer, here's another suggestion (as I haven't
&gt; heard anything further on B&amp;Js):
&gt; 
&gt; Saturday &amp; Sunday - July 15/16
&gt; 
&gt; CVA's 11th annual meet, Lime Rock Park, CT.
(skipped)&gt; 
 Looks like there were not much interest in the locations mentioned so far.
 Heres my suggestion if it is of any merit.
 I will be willing to volunteer to host a gathering at an RV site
 close to New York City if enough people show any interest.
 These meet will focus mainly on getting to meet everyone who
 owns a VW especially type 2's. The main focus will be on self-help
 knowing how bad VW is on helping VW owners without getting
 slaughtered at their dealerships.
 One thing we will try to do is to get volunteer experts 
 in the various areas e'g. fuel-injection, engines, trannys to answer
 questions.
 If we can all meet and have a good time we would have met our objectives.
 

 If you like the idea, e-mail to me with preferred dates. I will gather
 and summarise the results of this poll and confirm whether this
 event will come about.
