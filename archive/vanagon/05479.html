Subject: Insane Syncro Prices!!!
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 94 9:35:25 PDT


Saw a '90 Syncro Camper for sale at one of the local repair shops.

Here's the stats:

'90 Syncro Camper
Titian Red
Differential Lock
47K miles

Here's the killer... I saw the &quot;sale&quot; sticker on the side, so I walked
in and asked what his price was.  $24,500!!!  Derek Drew, don't die 
laughing at this absurd price.  The guy told me with a straight face
that people's mouths drop when they hear the price, or they just walk 
out without another word.  I just started laughing, until he said, very
seriously, &quot;Well, someone will pay that much.&quot;  

Sadly I'm afraid he's right.

Well, does anyone on the list want me to post the phone number of the
place?  I thought not.

PS.  Above Syncro can be seen at Autometrics in Berkeley, California.
