I ran from work screaming this afternoon with my bike and three or 
four tools in my backpack.  My goal was VW part # 113117323.  Oil 
cooler thingy.  Mine was either hacked by the previous owner or 
replaced with the wrong piece.  I also have a suspicion this thing saw
a change somewhere along the line.  Anyway, it is used to keep cooling
air from dumping out the bottom of the cooler on the right hand side 
on 1600DP's with the doghouse.

I had one spied on a 74 beetle on Tuesday but I didn't have any tools.
This was the only potential vw in the whole yard that had this part.  
All others had been crushed ): or were sans motor.  First thing to go 
was the hood.  Easy enough.  Next went the bolt that holds the tin 
over the cooler and then the two bolts holding the blower housing to 
the motor.  Now, I have no idea how to get to the generator strap.  I 
just can't get to the nut.  I mess with some other stuff.  Try taking 
off the whole pedestal.  Can't get to all those nuts either.  I have a
10mm and 13mm wrench, a four way reversable screwdriver and a big pair
of side cutters.  hmmmm  Ok, using the screwdriver as a chisel and the
cutters for a hammer I get the strap off there.  Now I can move the 
fan housing a little.  I look at the bug again.  It have been rolled. 
Ok, I can do this.  I won't have to feel too bad.  Twice during the 
process I was ready to quit.  There is a place in town with two rooms 
of engine parts.  They had said I could look around in there for the 
piece.  I know it is on this bug.  I just have to get it.  It is 
getting really creapy out there.  All there rusted and smashed cars 
everywhere.  I am a good half mile from the shop.  All I can hear is 
the wind.  A couple of more good yanks and it wants to come loose.  
Doh!  Hood brackets are in the way.  Off come those, very slowly.  
Take sockets then you go the junkyard.  Now all I have left between me
and that piece is the thermostat connecting rod.  I am thinking how 
this bug must die so my bus can live.  The species must continue.  
Yank some more.  There we go.  Now, two more bolts and the piece is in
my hand.  I am quite chuffed at this point.  I strut around a bit 
looking at the two buses there to see if they might have door pieces 
or something.  Nothing.  I did take the plate light.  I think it 
should bolt into my engine compartment somewhere.  Free light.  So I 
loaded everything back into my pack and washed my hands.  Gotta love 
that goop stuff.  I headed back up to the shop and put the part on the
counter.  This was something like an hour and half after I got there. 
The guy looked at me and said, is that it.  I said, sure, it was a 
little hard to get to.  He said one buck.  It just so happened that I 
found a buck on the floor this morning at the bagel place.  :)  Life 
is funny sometimes.
