Subject: 82 Westy FS Sussex Co. NJ

I have a 1982 Westy that I'd like to sell to help support my '86 Syncro
habit. The 82 has about 119k on the body and about 30k on the engine, and a
new transmission and clutch which are still under warranty. The canvas and
interior are in pretty decent shape. I'm about to do a muffler and front
brakes though we could talk first if anyone is interested. I'd like to get
$3500 or there abouts. You can e-mail direct if you'd like.
