&gt; 
&gt; would you believe that NOTHING in any of the books even mentions sodium-
&gt; filled valves? (except that one little paragraph in Bentley). notice that it
&gt; mentions ONLY the exhaust valves.  said exhaust valves were almost always
&gt; the ones to break first (especially on cylinder #3, on the beetle engines).
&gt; 
&gt; i think it was just an attempt to solve the old beetle engine problem of
&gt; #3 exhaust valve breaking. and they found out that the Type 4 engine didn't
&gt; really need them (and therefore some costs could be eliminated by getting
&gt; rid of the more expensive valves). it may be that fuel injection came along
&gt; about then, and with more control over the mixture (i.e., idiot-owner won't
&gt; be dorking with it as much), they could keep the temperatures more closely
&gt; under control.
&gt; 
&gt; NONE of the german books even mention sodium, so i have to assume (?) that
&gt; they never used them.
&gt; 
Thanks for looking all that stuff up.


&gt; &gt;   - I'm probably the only person on the planet who's curious about this.
&gt; yes, but we like you anyway. :)
