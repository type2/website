&gt;   I vote for March 24-16!! I have never had an anti-time experience before! If
&gt;   you have a lot of experience with this, I think my project manager could 
&gt;   use some help with a few deadlines - some of his employees spend all too
&gt;   much time on non-work activities &lt;hee, hee&gt;.

Reminds me of the old SNL skit - Relativity Express -- when it
absoutly, positivly has to be there yesterday.

Also a limerick, which I can't remember, about a guy who sets
off, in a relative way, and arrives the night before.
