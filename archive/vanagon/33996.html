&gt;I have a few questions about vanagons.
&gt;	1. What was the first year for the square headlights?

1986.


&gt;	2. Are the vanagon automatic tranmissions prone to failure?

No.

&gt;	3. I've heard stories of coolant leakage at the cyl. heads, is this a
common
&gt;problem with the waterboxer engine?

Yes. Head replacement or at least gasket replacement every 70,000 to 120,000
miles.


&gt;	4. Are there any other notable quirks about vanagons that would be handy to

&gt;know while looking for one to purchase?

Yes.  I'm sure others will have some comments here.  1986 was also the 1st
year for the larger 2.1 liter engine.  1983.5-1985 had 1.9 liter engines.
