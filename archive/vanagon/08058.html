Subject: 34-PICT 3 questions

I tried this yesterday and it didn't go so I will try again.  I am 
going to overhaul my 34-PICT 3.  I didn't see the kit listed in RMMW. 
Is this a typo or did I misread it?  Anyone know any other good 
sources for this?  Also, being a first time carb overhauler, should I 
go ahead and replace the float while I am in there?  Muir mentions 
that I should remove the electromagnetic fuel cutoff valve and says I 
can get a plug from the dealer.  I don't think so anymore.  Should I 
do this and if so where do I get the plug?  I have checked the valve 
and it does work.  Also, feelings on unhooking the autochoke would be 
appreciated.  I have done this already and it still starts in the 
cold.  It will not, however, idle.  Of course it didn't before, which 
is why I am overhauling.  Anyways, what do you think about keeping the
autochoke after the rebuild?  Thanks, Jim
