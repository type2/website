Subject: Eastwood's number

	Thanks for the number, friends! I called and will get
a can of their self-etching primer, $16.00 for the aerosol,
sometime next week. $18.xx with tax and shipping. Guess I'll have
to do a pannel of something in this and in Rustoleum and do a
long-term test. :)

	Mill Supply's replacement battery tray got crossed with
someone else's order and I got theirs and they got mine... Mill
Supply guy called me yesterday to warn me this happend, same day
the package arrived :( so I didn't open it and they'll
have the wrong stuff, whatever it is, picked up and will send my
part to me by second day air at no extra charge.

	As long as I was at it, I called the 1-800-444-VWUS and
ordered one of their 40th anniversary tapes!

	A friend found this:

              The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
              that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!
