Subject: Re: Type 2 Engine Mount

&gt;        I assume this subject has come up before, but I just discovered this
&gt;mailing list and couldn't find the FAQ.  I have just recently become the
&gt;co-owner of a 71 Westfalia Bus.  The engine is in good condition but one of
&gt;the bolts from the rear engine mount on the drivers side has broken out,
&gt;taking a small chunk of the block with it.  Talking with the local mechanic
&gt;I was told there is a kit you can buy to mount the engine from the four
&gt;bolts on  the oil pump.  Does anyone know what this kit is called, and where
&gt;it might be available?  Any help would be appreciated.

        Same thing happened to me, but I swapped out engines between my Bus
and Bug. I did buy the adaptor, however, for later use. It is Bugpack part
#4538 and should be available from any VW flaps. I paid $12.50 + tax for
mine.

Peace,
