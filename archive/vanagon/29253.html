Subject: Short T.V. clip VW Bug/Beatle...if ya know what I mean...
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 1995 08:36:43 -0800 (PST)

One of the local radio stations is doing a promo of the Beatles and offering
up a refurbished (okay restored :) ) '64 Bug.  The station kept mentioning
that it would be on display yesterday at the Lasher VW dealership in South
Sac. So I decided, 'what-the-heck' and went on down and had a look at it.  It
had a nice creamy white paint job and a brand new 'fresh' ;p  engine
that was lacking an engine seal to which another guy and I alerted the driver 
to and that they should get that attended to ASAP.  Hopefully, he'll heed 
our advice.  He said the interior headliner was going to be redone.  Basic 
seat colors were installed and an old AM radio was installed, but I wasn't 
sure if it was OEM or not.  All around, it looked pretty nice and I was 
told that it was not a Bondo job, but reworked bodyparts.

Anyway....  There was a guy with a video camera taking shots of the
whole thing and I didn't think much of it until later on in the evening,
my mother-in-law called and said she had seen me on the 5 o'clock news!
I just laughed and thought, &quot;Well, I hope they didn't get too much of
my profile in there.&quot; ;)  She said it was only a face shot.  Anyway,
I guess that was my short moment in the spotlight.  :)

Cheers!
