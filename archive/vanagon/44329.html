Subject: Thanks for Help w/Vanagon Motor in Bus

Just wanted to thank the many list members who provided advice 
regarding the backfiring problem in the '82 Vanagon motor that I 
was putting in a '76 Bus.  Special thanks, too, to Bus Boys, who 
called me on a Sunday, when they were closed(!), to offer some 
suggestions, even though they had nothing financially to gain from 
it.  

Problem ended up being that before I received the '82 motor, 
someone had removed the distributor,  turned the motor, and put the 
distributor back in.  I had not expected this, because there would 
have been no reason to remove the distributor while pulling the 
motor, and the previous owner said that he had not done so.  
Nevertheless, somebody did...

It never ceases to amaze me how many helpful, and knowledgable, 
people there are here!

-Ron Salmon
