&gt; My son's '73 Westie has a sticker on the gas fill door that says
&gt;  Octane min 91 ROZ/RON
&gt; 
&gt; Octane is actually in German and spelled differently from that.  Is
ROZ/RON
&gt; the same octane scale we use here in the US?  If not, how does it
convert?
&gt; 
Bill,
No, ROZ/RON is not the same octane scale used in the US.  In the US, the
CLC method is used.

Conversion:  91 RON = 87 CLC
