&gt; IN the new Eurovan, the rear passenger seat is molded, which equates with
&gt; comfort for passengers riding, but does not create a great sleeping surface
&gt; (ridges and bumps). So what has Winnebago (Bag-a-Wino) done to rectify this
&gt; situation?

	In the 95 version, Winnebago put in their own rear seat.  A fairly
flat profile.
 
&gt; There is a very thin (about 3/4 inch) mattress that unfolds from the back
&gt; area and *SNAPS TO THE SEAT AND BACK area* to attempt to flatten out the
&gt; ridges. I personally tried this out, and found it cumbersome, ungainly in
&gt; appearance, and extremely uncomfortable!

	The 95 has a pad that has a couple snaps to keep it compact
but deploys quite easily and just sits there; no snapping required.  Could
be softer for sleeping but is nice and flat.

&gt; Also, the rear area is &quot;slotted,&quot; ostensibly to allow moving larger sheets
&gt; of plywood, or furniture, so the &quot;top mattress&quot; covers this area and the
&gt; spacer piece that covers it. ...Seem to me --lots of pieces to get lost
&gt; over the years!

	Mmmm.  One piece of laminated wood?  I've never had mine out. 
Probably never will.

&gt; The rear closet has a sliding door, which is a good thought, however, the
&gt; sliding door on the vehicle I examined was made of cheap mortarboard, (sort
&gt; of like thin wall panelling). It did not slide easliy, and looked as though
&gt; the last person had popped it out of its track.

	The door on the 95 is heavy laminate like the cabinet walls.  Mine
has never popped from the track and slides easily.
