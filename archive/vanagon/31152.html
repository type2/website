There's a switch that tells the computer when you actually have your 
foot off the pedal and it's supposed to be idling. I can't remember what 
it's called....pause while I check the big green book ....
Throttle valve/deceleration/idle switch.  It's designed so that if you 
have your foot off the gas (or it thinks you do) and the RPMs are greater 
than 1500 then it cuts out.  If this is adjusted wrong, then it'll think 
you're still supposed to be idling and will kill the engine if the RPMs 
are greater than 1500 starting the cycle over.
On the other hand, on the same page it says that if you &quot;operate the 
throttle valve swtich by hand [sic engine warm (140F)] and accelerate 
slowly, the engine speed must fluctuate (surges).&quot;

That seems to imply that the surging is correct! Wow.
(Section 24.33 in the BGB)

Correct adjustment: 
&quot;
Throttle valve closed
-- adjust screw 2 (the one on the throttle arm) so that switch just closes
-- from this position turn adjusting screw exactly one turn farther in
-- secure adjusting screw with sealant
&quot;
&quot;Note
Correct adjustment is very important. If switch is mis-adjusted engine 
may surge or cut-out during acceleration&quot;

Hope that's of value.  It's an eye opener for me.
