How about the six cylinder Subaru?  Would it be too much power?

Thanks,
Ivan

&gt; &gt; I saw an ad for a Subaru 1800 4WD asking just GB#50 that 50 pounds for
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; engine. Should I buy this as an insurance policy?

&gt; Lionel,
&gt; The 2.2L Legacy engine is a much better candidate- more power, more
&gt; efficient, more modern. Available in turbo version.
