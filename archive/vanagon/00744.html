Subject: Leaky exhaust
Date: Wed, 4 May 1994 15:02:51 -0500 (CDT)

Okay, I have some kind of exhaust leak on my '71 bus.  I have asked 
about this before and the response I got taught me enough that I might
just take it back to the guy who worked on it before and let him deal 
with it.  However, I don't the time or money to do that.  Let me get 
to the point.  It is now May and so in about one week here in Nebraska
it will 110 degrees for the next several months and then -15 for 
several months after that.  Is there a quick and easy way for me to 
disconnect the heater or shut it off by using some combination of 
those levers?  I don't really need the heater as I never drive in 
winter, bikes are more fun in the snow.  I only need the bus for 
summer vacations.  In fact, I have one coming up at the end of the 
month.  Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Jim
