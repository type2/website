Subject: Re: Care and feeding of pilot bearings


&gt;&gt; Make sure the felt washer/seal between the flywheel and crankshaft is 
still
&gt;&gt; there. Replace if needed.  Still available at dealer.  Some repalcement
&gt;&gt; bearings also have lip seal built in.  use this if possible.  Grease does
&gt;not
&gt;&gt; matter once the clutch dust gets in.  Felt does better job of excluding 
the
&gt;&gt; dust.  two seals better than one.  If trans input shaft is damaged at 
all,
&gt;it
&gt;&gt; must be replaced.  Cost about $65 at dealer.  Relatively easy to change.
&gt;
&gt;Mine was about $75.  BTW, I'm wondering just how critical it is to
&gt;replace the felt.  The mechanics I talked to questioned the need to
&gt;replace it.  The pilot brg itself is actually the same as a TI's and the
&gt;TI gland nut that the brg resides in does not have a felt washer.  Just
&gt;curious.

T1s have a paper washer between the flywheel and flywheel shims, put
on when you bolt on the flywheel. Is this some sort of dust shield?

 &quot;Lord, give me serenity to accept what I cannot change, the strength to
 change that which I can, and the the firepower to make the difference.&quot;
