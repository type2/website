Subject: First Posting, Doh!, Splittie parts WTB (Medium-long length)

Dear fellow and fellowette lovers of the oblong objects d'art,

After eavesdropping on your converversations for a week, I have come to
realize that you're my kind of people &amp;') . I figured I could safely share
a couple of &quot;Idiot factor&quot; incidents.

In the first incident, a happy new teenaged '71 Bus owner had his bus in
the right hand side of a double bay garage. A post separates the two bays.
His new extractor is rather loud within the confines of the garage so his
father yells to him from outside to back it out before he awakens sleeping
baby brother. Father can not be heard over the engine so son rolls down
window. No help. Father yells louder and gets angrier so son opens door,
leans out and cranes neck. After more yelling son gets message and quickly
puts car in reverse, looks over right shoulder as they teach in drivers ed,
and backs Bus out of garage to the point where partially closed door
catches on garage post and bends around into the front sheet metal.

Second incident: father son and family friend work frantically one evening
to prep sons car for long important trip next day. Among other thing,
clutch, PP and throw-out bearing (aptly named in early VW's) are on the
agenda. Many hours later the floor is being swept and tools put away when
son walks up to dad and thanks him for the &quot;extra&quot; clutch plate laying in
its box on the bench. Doh! you guessed it, out comes the floor jack again.

Hope no one already posted identical whoopses.

To my credit, I have owner, maintained and operated, three Ghias, two bugs,
a '69 Type II, and I've even built a 2180cc powered Beck 550 spyder replica
(for those who are into priceless Porsches at VW prices).

My current project (and the reason I am afflicting you) is my newly
acquired '67 Kombi. For my money I recieved: nearly rustless metal, safari
windows, disk brake conversion, freshish '71 dual port ... and a hippie-era
nightmare of cheap paneling, shag carpet and contact cement inside.

Does anyone have components or suggested sources for a good deluxe interior
or not-so-good interior and an upholsterer?

I could also use some of the big &quot;Elephant Ear&quot; mirrors and I'm even
thinking of converting to a sunroof while its gutted if I can find a
suitable roof clip near San Diego.

Any helpful comments or suggestions will be coveted.

Thanks and don't be strangers!

Regards, Jim
