Could be the following: 

clogging of bypass port in master cylinder
(anybody remember felix the cat?) necessitates cleaning/rebuild of said
cylinder

insufficient clearance between piston push rod and master cylinder piston
(this can be adjusted as per haynes, chiltons etc)

shoe return springs weak or broken

rubber parts swollen because of improper fluid/bad fluid - not uncommon
for stored vehicle.
