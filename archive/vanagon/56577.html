Subject: runs rough in rain

hi volks-

my '88 westy has been very reliable for the +/- 6 monbths i've owned it,
until now.  it runs fine on dry days, but in the rain (or slush) it starts
out fine, but within 10 minutes starts stumbling.  it misses and idles very
low 500-600.  the quick fix of turning the ignition off and on (thanks to
the list for knowing of this) works for a very short (pun intended) time.

i've followed the list for 6-8 months now, and know of the intermittent
power loss problems, but this seems different as it only happens in the rain.

any thought/hints/procedures for me to try?

thanks...david

ps-  i think ron's business and prescence on this list is great.  we have
to be the toughest consumers out there (if you can make here, you'll make
it anywhere).
