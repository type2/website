Subject: Re: Syncro Tranny Died

My transmission seize twice. It was freed by my mechanic the first time and
by myself the second time. Here is what my mechanic told me.

My tranny need a rebuild. There is no doubt of it. The synchro ring for the
fourth to third gear is worn out and the seize (the tranny got stuck in third
gear) is caused by the worn and bent synchro ring. But I have driving with a
bad synchro ring for more than a year, when I have to down shift from 4 to 3,
I use the double clutch technique. My mechnic taught me so to avoid the cost
of rebuiid and it works until the tranny seize. Then he taught me how to free
that seize. The main point is that you must not afraid to use some force on
the stick(shifter). Drive the car. I could start the Vanagon on third gear so
could you. Then step on the clutch, gun the engine and release the clutch
fast. When you release the clutch, making sure there is no car behind you
because you will be stopping. Try not to stall the engine. Step on the clutch
and and try to shift (use some force it necessary) into netrual. If it
doesn't work, repeat the above procedure a few more time.

That is how I free the seize of my tranny. The transmisson works fine for
more than four months already since I freed it last time. Of course I still
have to double clutch the thing but I avoid the rebuilt.

About the whinning sound, I have it also. My mechanic said it is from the
differential. If I can't live with it then I have to rebuild it. Otherwise
leave it along, it won't break.

Hope the above information could help you.
