Subject:  Bus drivers and waving.

Greetings!! As a long-time (78 Westfalia) waver and recently confessed lurker
I think it's worth considering forming a &quot;Vanagon/Bus/Westy&quot; Rescue League.
 Something like the rescue leagues for different breeds of dogs whose owners
don't deserve them, don't treat them right, etc.  Have to have the right
attitude  (i.e. wave, leave the bugs in your bra AND your teeth) or lose it.
 Maybe there will be a new solidarity between air-cooled and watercooled
folk, uniting against the dontdeservems!
