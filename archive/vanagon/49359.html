Subject: Alternator story

Hi Guys,
My 86 GL's  alternator light would go on when I put on a full load.  Since
the car was new to me I replaced the battery (I consider this a given when
I buy a car) and tightened the Alt. belt.  Problem solved, ok not quite.

After about a month the problem came back.  It still was acting like a
loose belt, sometimes I could get the light to go off at 1500rpm sometimes
I had to gun it to 4k.  This time, after looking at the service records
from the previous owner, I decided to replace the Alt., it had 120k on it ,
figured it might be it's time.

The rebuild came with the wrong pully on it so I took the old pully off.
Behold I found the problem.  It looks like someone forgot to put in the
woodruff(sp) key on the rotor.  Put the rebuild in and have had no
problems. I just wish I had checked  for the pully itself slipping before I
spent the bucks.

Just something to think about.
