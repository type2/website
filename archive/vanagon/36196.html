Subject: Mounting a BN-4 (forward luggage area)
Date: Mon, 26 Feb 1996 09:32:31 -0800 (PST)

So Dieter Dworkin Muller says:
&gt; :  area.
&gt; 
&gt; This reminds me.  The shop manual for my BN-4 (early '70s) says that
&gt; the heater mounts in the ``forward luggage area''.  Since this is an
&gt; Nth generation photocopy, the photograph of the installed unit is
&gt; completely undecipherable.  Now, most of my experience is with
&gt; microbusi, but I've been in a 1971 a few times.  What, precisely, is
&gt; the ``forward luggage area''?

I would think that the forward luggage area refers to the front trunk/bonnet?
of the 412.
