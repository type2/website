Subject: for Tucson people only, Arizona Bus Club meeting


For those of you in Tucson (the statz say there are three beside me
and I already talked to Nate Holtz so this is for the other 2)

I'm having an organizational meeting of the Tucson chapter of the
Arizona Bus Club this coming Wednesday, June 5, at 7 PM.  Its being
held at Eric's Fine Food and Ice Cream, 1702 E. Speedway, in Tucson.

Owners of any and all VW transporters or just interested people are
all welcome.  (kinda like vanagon_at_lenti!)

I hope to see you there.
