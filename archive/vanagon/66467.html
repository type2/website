Subject:      Re: Need propane regulator for 83.5 Westy

&gt;         Well it seems I need a new propane regulator for my Westy so if
&gt;         anyone out there has a used one please let me know.  Also, how
&gt;         hard would this be for me to replace?  Are the threads backwards?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

Bryan,

In addition to the Bus Depot (see my earliler posting), you might also
check with EuroAmerican RV Products, (818) 760-4214.

While not technically difficult (*if* you can get a *direct* replacement -
which, frankly, is *not* likely), there are some real risks inherent in
doing it yourself.  To put it bluntly, if you're not familiar with this
stuff (eg. what the pressure relief valve does), I'd recommend you pay the
RV place to do it.
