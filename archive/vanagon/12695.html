Subject: RE: Question about gas heaters

S. Johnson asks about gas auxiliary heaters, of which I have one in my
Vanagon.  I've seen several air-cooled Vgons with this option, so it was
certainly available, maybe even widely available, in the U.S.  The only
caution in the owner's manual about it is not to run it so much you run
down the battery, so I would think it is campable.  It has a timer on
it just like gas heaters in Things, etc.  Should not be TOO big a chore
to retrofit: it takes the place of 3 or 4 feet of ducting and has its own
little fuel pump etc.
