&gt; Subject: '78 Westy SHOULD I BUY IT?????

&gt; Depending on mileage what is a fair counter offer range for
&gt; a '78?

&gt; Patty

Old Cars Price Guide (December 1995) puts a '78 &quot;Campmobile&quot;
at $2400 for Good and $4800 for Very Good conditions.  Very
Good is a &quot;20-footer&quot; meaning it looks perfect from 20 feet
away, but wear is obvious upon closer inspection.

Just a point of reference....
