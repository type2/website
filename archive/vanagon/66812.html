&lt;&lt; In theory any bolt only needs 1 or 2 threads to develop full strength. In
 practice its best to have at 1 diameter of threads sticking out the nut.  &gt;&gt;

Actually the theory calls for at least 3 threads to make the shear strength
of the threads equal to the tensile strength of the stud.  Still, 3 threads
doens't &quot;seem&quot; enough to be.  I too, am comforted by at least one diameter's
worth of engagement.
