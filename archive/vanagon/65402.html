Subject:      Trade my 86 Syncro for a Westy?

Now that the camping season is almost over here in Minnesota, I am
wondering whether anyone would be interested in a trade (or swap plus
cash).  I am interested in obtaining a 1986 or newer Westfalia, with a/c,
either manual or automatic transmission, good mechanical and body.  I have
a 1986 Syncro GL,
7 passenger, with the fold down rear seat/bed, greyish-blue, with 131M.
Engine is strong.  Recent new or rebuilt components include the
transmission (5 speed), clutch, driveshaft, cv joints, brakes, alternator,
etc.  Body is good, with one rusty lower panel on driver's side that was
poorly repaired by a previous owner (which would be reflected in its
current value).  A/C needs a new hose.
I can drive to your location, most probably.  Since the summer was spent in
repair, I still haven't taken my vacation.
Am I nuts to consider trading after sinking so much into repairs this past
year?
As an alternate, does anyone have any suggestions about a partial/complete
camper conversion?
Thanks in advance for any assistance.
