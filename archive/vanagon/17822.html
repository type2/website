Subject:       VW's was Re: Wanted: Eurovan (Portland, OR)

I would like to add just a general comment about VW's in general, in 
addition to Ric's comments about the Eurovan.  I firmly believe that 
ALL VW's are an investment.  Their cars are just excellent, and last 
many years.  My '87 Golf Diesel looks like new with absolutely NO 
corrosion anywhere with 175000 KM.  VW's have excellent steel, and 
well constructed, tight bodies.  This makes them a little more 
expensive to build, and buy, but they hang in there very well in the 
long term.  You don't buy VW's to dump in a few years... they last 
and look good for 10+ years.  My mother-in-law's old GTI lasted 14 
years without ANY corrosion before she sold it, and bought a new 
Golf.  

How many manufacturers rustproof their cars at the factory?  The 
thing to remember, is that a lot of cars are built so that they get 
dumped within 6 or so years so you buy a new one.  Look at the paint 
on VW's.  There's real paint on those cars... nice and thick, and 
shiny.  A lot of domestics (please, no flames here!) need to 
understand what makes paint shine, and last.  Japanese cars last 5 
years before they rust out where I reside.  I've owned 3 Hondas, a 
Toyota Land Cruiser, Toyota Tercel Wagon (4wd) which was a lemon, a 
Jeep Cherokee (an excellent vehicle that I traded after 4 years for 
my Syncro Westy).  None have performed so well as my VW's

Just loving my VW's

Harry.

&gt; 
&gt; I want to add a couple of additional comments regarding Pete, Norman
&gt; and other EV'er's comments, and that is I expect that my EV will be
&gt; around for 10 years or more.....based on two factors. 1. the construction
&gt; of the body is as solid as any VW Van I have ever seen...and judging
&gt; by the amount of older VW vans, it should survive well into the 21st
&gt; century. BTW, I have a copy of a German Magazine's crash test
&gt; of the T4 (from Gute Fahrt?) in which they not only did the
&gt; usual safety tests, but the off center front end crash test, and the
&gt; T4 did the best of all the European offerings (including the Chrysler
&gt; Shitboxes)....
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The drive train should be able to deliver at least 150k miles. This
&gt; is based upon my personal experience with both Audi 5000s (with the
&gt; 5cyl gas engines) and the engine/drive train of my GTI (which has
&gt; 215k miles and still going strong).
&gt; 
&gt; With that in mind, the price I paid for the vehicle is more like an
&gt; investment!
