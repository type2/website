Hi Martha -

If the previous person forgot to fill in the odometer reading, fill it in
yourself and date it with the same color pen ink.  I really don't think the
DMV is gonna throw ya on the rack and use Chinese water torture.

Seems like when I have a bill of sale to present to them, they don't need it
and just ask what you paid for it (or mark it on the pink slip).  It's when I
don't have it, they get all pissy and demand a copy.  I'm a California Native
(3rd Generation), but I still agree with out-of-staters that this is a
strange place to live and deal with the bureaucracy (sp?).

Keep 'em runnin' :)
