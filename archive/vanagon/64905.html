Scott,

Getting to the starter can be hell if you are unprepared (I speak from
experience).  The Bentley Manual is most helpful, but if you do not have
it the List Archives are very helpful.  I have had to remove my starter
twice (rebuild did not have snap ring installed).  I can now remove it in
about 45 minutes and replace it in 20 to 30.

If you are not able to access the information you need, e-mail me and I
can provide step by step instructions.

Good luck,


Sean O'Corrain
