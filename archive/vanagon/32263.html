&gt;&gt; Ok, I'll bite...what the heck is a zagnut
&gt;
&gt; A zagnut is a candy bar and I have fond memories of eating them when a
&gt;young whipper snapper in San Fransisco (67-69 time frame).  However if you
&gt;want to know what's in it, I have no idea.  They are yummy as I recall
&gt;tho. I do remember eating them in a friend's dad's bug back then.


In the movie &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, the title character used a Zagnut bar to lure
a fly into his lair,while he was shrunk down to teensy size.

VW Content? Check out the title of the movie!

Ok, ok, I promise I'll be good from now on...   :^)
