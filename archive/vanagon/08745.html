&gt; 1.  An intermittent short in the circuit that includes the dash gauge 
&gt; showing engine heat.  Sometimes it's really not hot, but goes up so fast 
&gt; that a short is a likely candidate.  Sometimes it runs fine for a while 
&gt; and then rapidly moves to hot.  Sometimes it's accurate.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A sticking thermostat.  Once in a while the engine actually is hot.  
&gt; Why doesn't the fan run?  Well, dummy (speaking to self) because the 
&gt; water isn't hot enough to run.  How do I know it will run?  Because I 
&gt; turned on the AC and the fan did indeed run.  Why isnt' the water hot?  
&gt; Because it's the engine that's hot, but water is not circulating by the fan.
&gt; 
&gt; Running the fan with the engine hot doesn't bring the temp down any, either.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I've concluded I need to change the thermostat.
&gt; 
&gt; So, where is it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks (and if I'm wronge, don't tell me, just shoot me - this is too much).
&gt; 
Jim: I'm not big on guns, beign Quaker so I can't shoot you.  I'll give 
you a suggestion, though, and more conservative than replacing the 
thermostat, which is do-able (and probably original, like mine and 
probably needs to be replaced) but a hassle getting to.

Try replacing the temperature sending switch.  There are two sensors
located on the top of the thermostat housing (it has the top large
radiator hose leading to it) the one with the rather intricate looking
connection is the sensor for the Electronic Contol Unit (ECU) or the
&quot;computer&quot; the one with the rather simple looking connection (push-on) is
the temperature gauge sending switch (if you are looking down on it, it's
the one on the right--and I guess there is no way to look at it but down). 
Before replacing it, clean the connection, it may be just caked in so much
crud that it works unreliably.  If that doesn't work, replace it. 

The thermostat is mounted on the bottom of the thermostat housing (the
part that the two switches are screwed in to, remove the flange that
connects to the lower radiator hose and the thermostat is mounted between
that flange and the thermostat housing.  I wish I could describe this more
accurately--will be glad to copy the appropriate pages out of Bentley
manual and send to you.  E-mail me your address.
