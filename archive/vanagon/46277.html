Subject: '81 exhaust parts source?

Hello everyone,

        It's exhaust system replacement time for my 81 Vanagon, and I was
hoping that some of you might be able to share information about replacement
parts sources. I need:

(The much dreaded) Cross-over pipe
Catalytic converter
Muffler
Tail pipe
Related gaskets, clamps, hangers, etc.

I'd prefer to find &quot;direct fit&quot; parts if possible, but would consider all
alternatives.  Any suggestions? Sources??

Please reply by e-mail, if possible.

Thanks in advance,

Bill Devlin
