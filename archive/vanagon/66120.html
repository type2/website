Jim,
I don't fully understand the relationship between a specific tires max
inflation rating and rolling resistance vs another tire. The Michelins
on my '93EV MV require 50#. If I were to run them with only 35#'s I'd
have a lot more rolling resistance therefore more heat and worse fuel
milage. Are the Pirelli's at 35# the same as the Michelin's at 50# as
far as rolling resistance? How about handling, did you notice any
improvement with the pirelli's? Sorry,kind of vague questions, hard to
put into words.
                        Thanks, Rod in west Texas

&gt;  just replaced those goodyears with 205/65-15 p4000 pirelli's _at_ $65.00
&gt; each.  i know that they are not the same light truck rating but the
&gt; max inflation of 35 lbs gives just about the same load rating anyway.
&gt; i just put 2000 miles on them in 1 1/2 weeks at that inflation with no
&gt; ill effects.  the tires also ran cool to the touch at sustained 70
&gt; mph.
&gt;
&gt; cheers
