&gt; Anyone know a good place to get a new skylight? This one is cracked.
&gt; I tried WCM but no luck. They recommended Bus Boys (never heard of them)
&gt; but they're closed until Jan 2. I'm hoping to avoid the dealer :(

You're talking about the roof vent, right?  I just got a new plastic lid
for mine for $9.95 from Camping World.  I think mine was a fairly standard
one (Jensen?) and several trailer supply places had it, but Camping World
had the lowest price and best selection (i.e. smoke, white, clear...)
