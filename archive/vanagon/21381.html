I don't have an aversion to hitting the delete button, either.
Who knows, maybe Olga and her girls drive Volkswagen busses?
How will we ever know for sure?  It's not like this stuff was posted daily.

&gt;Is there a locking engine hatch mechanism for a 79 bus.  I have noticed some
&gt;70's type westys with locks on the engine hatch.  Would those work if I found
&gt;one at a junkyard (or bought one new).  Thanks for any input.

Yes, they're available at the dealer for $80.00 - 211 827 5030 is the part no.
I bought one about ten years ago and I don't remember it being that much money.
Save yourself some bread and try a junkyard, then get it re-keyed.  It's held 
in the engine cover with only one philips head bolt.
