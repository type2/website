Subject: ATF levels

Hi, I'm wondering if I've read the ATF level correctly on my 85 
Westy. I drove the van about fifteen miles, had it on level ground, 
and was running the engine in park with the parking brake fully 
engaged when I checked the level. It barely shows anything on the 
dipstick!!! Am I doing everything correctly? could this be a 
misreading? I don't want to overfill, do I just add ATF with a funnel 
into where the dipstick is? should I add just one quart of the 
Dextron? where is the other fluid they mention in the manual added? 
Also, wondering if anyone has a handy trick for tightening the window 
handles, they are loose and the screw behind the knob is difficult to 
get around behind to, (just the knob on the handle is loose, not the 
handle itself.) Also, the key to the water tank under the third flip 
cap (city water?) is missing, will I have to buy a new unit? I'm 
already replacing the flip top cap covers for this one and the 
electrical hookup for about 35 bucks apiece. Thanks for any advice,
Rick
