&gt; requires a lot more effort to lift now.  My struts on the door are shot
&gt; anyway.  I have a vise grip for one strut, and the other was removed and I
&gt; insert a piece of wood.  So I can open the hatch, but I remove the bikes
&gt; if I am stopped for the night any place where I would have the hatch open.

Watch yourself with that vice-grip trick.  My dad got mashed when my 
uncle's truck shell with the same symptom's vice-grip fell off.  With 
a quick slip, the shell lid came flying down right on his face.
