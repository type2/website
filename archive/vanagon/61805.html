Subject: ticking sound from engine

After starting my 86 vanagon this morning I immediately heard a loud ticking
sound, which followed the frequency of the engine speed.  I quickly shut it
down after moving it to level ground.  It had sat at about an eight percent
slope for a week.  My previous use showed no sign of noise, idle problems or
power loss.  I did previously notice some emissions during the warm up
period, turning transparent after warming up.   I have no evidence of
leaking oil or coolant.  I just changed the oil about 100 miles ago.  It
still registers as full.   I  superficially checked the exhaust system for
obvious leaks while it was ticking away, and didn't find any.  It sounded
during my second start like it was coming from the engine.  The compression
was just checked 400 miles ago, and was an absolutely 150 across each
cylinder.  I know that this is insufficient information for much of a
diagnosis, but I am looking for suggestions of what I should check next.

Moderately worried
