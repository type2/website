Subject: 87 SYNCRO VAN TRANSMISSION BAD?


My first posting to this list......

I have an 87 syncro van with approx 125kmi on it.  Initiallly, when I 
shifted from 3rd to 4th it would pop out of gear once, i would shift it back 
in gear and continue on.  This condition degraded.  It will not stay in 4th 
for any period of time.  I need to keep slight pressure on the shift column. 


I tried shortening (first 1/8&quot; then 1/4&quot;) and then lengthening the shift 
linkage to no avail.

****What specific problems do these symptoms lead to?*****

I took it to a shop and they confirmed no external problems.
Now the fun part........
Should I just get a rebuilt tranny with a warranty (1 yr/unlim miles) or 
should i get the tranny dropped, cracked and diagnosed.  A rebuilt tranny 
has been quoted at $1400 (+ labor, mat'ls, etc brings total bill to $1800), 
cracking, diagnosing, repairing individual components, etc will cost at 
least $1800.  I'm thinking that the rebuilt is easiest for the mech to deal 
with.

Dealer estimate is outa sight.
Does VOA have any support for this problem?

Thanks,
Fred Porter
