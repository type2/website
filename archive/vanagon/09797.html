well you have certainly taken it to a new level of detail dave! i was
referrring the info. more on a choice of appropriate beds than anything,
but i do enjoy reading a more detailed account of westy's through the
years. Somebody should really create a book profiling the evolution on the
various incarnations (Westy, Dormobile, Devon etc.) yjrough the years. I
know i would buy a copy!
