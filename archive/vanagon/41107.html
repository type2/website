Subject: 1996 EV Pictures

I got an e-mail from an EV supporter who thought I should clarify
that the Westfalia pictures I posted yesterday have some great shots of the
redesigned '96 EV. Click on the topmost picture to download a very detailed
shot of the new front end design.

The link is from the &quot;VW -The Facts&quot; section of my page at:
