  I've never had the propane vendor balk at filling my 17lb. tank for
my gas bar-b-que.  My tank's been painted over at least twice and they
don't give it a second thought.  The vendor is a motor home and RV 
retailer across town.
  On the other end of the spectrum, the C02 vendor that fills my 5lb. 
tank for homebrew kegs is very particular.  I think this is because 
the CO2 supply must be &quot;food grade&quot; in this application.  They always
check the labels and date stamped in the steel tank.  Always.
