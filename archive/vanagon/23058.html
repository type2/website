Comment:        6V Flywheels and Type IV Oil Temp
Level:          1, Number : 1

&gt;&gt; Actually, on my '65 and later my '64 (which came converted) the stock 6V
&gt;&gt;starters were left in place and worked fine for many years.

     When I converted my '66 Bug to 12v, I left the 6V starter and solenoid
     in there. Never had a problem. On the coldest day, I could go out and
     crank the engine right over. On warm days, the starter sounded like
     one of those compressed air ones on the big rigs.. Whoosh!

     Wiper motor, now thats another (amusing) story...
     Maybe next Friday...
