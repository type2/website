Subject: '84 Westy, sell, part out, or keep it?

I appreciate any comments or suggestions that you may be able to give me.
I have an '84 Westy with 170,000 miles.  I have new tires, leaky water
seals (very small but continuous drips now), and I will need to do some
transmission work.

What should I do?  I don't know if it is worth much as is.  I have thought
that it may be worth more as parts by selling the Westy components.  I have
even thought of pirating the stove/sink/frig for my other van as the new
Dometic frig that I would like to get is about $700.

Thank you for your thoughts,


Alan  : )
