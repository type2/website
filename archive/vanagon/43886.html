Subject:       Re: /f Best SIG Award


&gt; I would like to nominate Steve Maher for the 
&gt; &quot;Too Much Time On His Hands&quot; Best SIG files
&gt; award.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any competition?

Anyone who quotes a 50 line message, leaves a two line message and 
then has a 20 line .sig is a winner in my book!  :) 

Wait?  That's what I just did!  &lt;big friday grin!&gt;
