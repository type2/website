&gt;I, too, have noticed that it is VERY difficult to read
&gt;the oil-stick exactly!  All hints appreciated....

Don't keep your oil so clean!  If its too clean, its impossible to
see against the stick!

Just kidding - I'm anal about changing the oild - I do it (change oil)
in my 911 every other month!  And it takes 8 quarts!
