Subject:      Winterize Water Tank &amp; Sink??

Cold weather is approaching, and as a first time owner, I need to know if
it is sufficient to simply open the tank outlet under the bus and let the
water drain out, or is antifreeze required to prevent any freezing damage?

How about any potential water traps in the lines to/from the tank to the tap?

If antifreeze is required, how much need to put in and is there a low
priced, non-toxic fluid to use.  Would rather not have to worry about
remnants of toxic antifreeze with the first drink next spring, but a bottle
of Vodka is a little expensive for this purpose!

Thanks
