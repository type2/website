Subject: Re:WANTED Cool paint ideas

Well, since I could find a green camper,I guess I'll have to paint the
one I have. The van goes in the body shop next week and should be ready
by the LiMBO Rites of Spring in Carlisle,PA.  Actually, at this point I
was going to paint the camper the original color, Irovy. But I could go
with green. =)  I'll leave it a surprise til I show up at Carlisle.  
Take care.
