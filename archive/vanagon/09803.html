So Alistair Bell says:
&gt; 
&gt; Steve Johnson complains about his chattering wipers...
&gt; 
&gt; I have had similar problems. I twisted the wiper arms (as per Bentley) with
&gt; some success. But the best solution was fitting &quot;aerofoil&quot; blades. Thes
&gt; are rigid plastic holders with channels to &quot;create a downforce&quot; when air
&gt; flows through them. Well I don't know if that works but the rubber blade
&gt; and the holder are good quality and fit tightly to the arm. They didn't
&gt; chatter, and they wiped well.
&gt; I bought 18&quot; ones, but I think the next time I'll look into 20&quot;, for more
&gt; coverage.
&gt; 

Um...what are these &quot;aerofoil&quot; blades?  What brand are we talking about and
where do I get them?
