Subject: Bodywork Book?

Help!
Sombody please stop me before I do anything stupid! Before I start asking
dumb questions about bodywork I must read a book. Ordinarily, before I do
*anything* thaat I haven't done beforre I will read lots of books. Don't know
why this was any different. But the sobering sight of a quarter-panel full of
Bondo has brought me around. Can someone please recommend a good book (this
dummy needs lots of pretty pictures) for someone doing bodywork for the first
time? I promise not to post any dumb questions re: bodywork if you can (not
this week anyway). Thanks in advance.
