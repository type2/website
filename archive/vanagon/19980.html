Subject: BakePacker recall

To all BakePacker owners:
This noon I went to REI to get a BakePacker and they didn't have any because 
they said that they had all been recalled.  I know some of you (Martha, 
Pete) have gotten these lately - you might want to check with them as to the 
ones you bought and see of they are included, or dangerous, or whatever.

BTW - Martha - I lost the number for ordering direct - could you send it to 
me?  TIA.
