Subject:      it's Friday ... more embarassing stats.

well ... since i can't sleep (old age makes you that way), and i was just
fooling around (old fools do that, you know), i decided to see what the
stats on the list were, as regards number of messages posted. needless to
say, i was a bit agast. i just really don't think i've posted THAT many more
than every body else!!! do i really talk that much??? i mean, i could see
maybe 500 or even 600 .... but 900!!!!????

(methinks Gerry has selective coding in his total routine!!! :)  hey! it
could happen!)

well, anyway. for better or worse, here are the top 25:

191 out of 234 have posted something to the list. which is a lot more
participation that i had thought. :)  of course, there do seem to be
a bit of motor-mouthing by a very few ...
