Subject: Re: Bug Jam

    &gt;        Is anybody going to the Bug Jam this weekend. I will be 
&gt;setting off from Manchester about lunchtime tommorrow. Is anybody 
&gt;else going from this direction at about that time. I will be in a 

Ann and I will be going on Friday evening. Look out for us in the pits, 
(Ann's car is on page 61 of July's Volksworld) we've got a Red and white 73 
with a big orange side tent.
