Subject: Re: Buying (building) a new Vanagon

     According to the VW South Africa page:
     
        http://www.vw.co.za/bus/bus_club/tech.html
     
     you can still buy a Vanagon in SA.  Looks like it's offered with the 4 
     and 5 cylinder in-line waterpumpers.
     
     'Course you'd have a near impossible time getting one into the US, but 
     hey, fantasies are just that.
