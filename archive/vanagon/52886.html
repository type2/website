Subject: 97 EV questions


Hi,

	I'm a newbie so don't hurt me.  I'm (I think) in the market
for a 95-96 EV camper, but I'm tempted to take the plunge and go for
a new 97.  In my attempt to do an analysis, I have the following
questions:

1) Does the VR6 with the (must have) automatic still feel substantialy
stronger than the audi 5 with a 5 speed?

2) Is the &quot;low speed traction control&quot; a new feature with the 97?

3) Does it work substantially better in snow?

4) Any other noticable differences between 96 and 97?

Thanks for any help :-)
