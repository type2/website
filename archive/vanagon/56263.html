&gt; Hello-
&gt;         I want to flush my coolant system as the PO used regular antifreeze
&gt; which I believe has been in there for quite a long time (well, as long as
&gt; the engine has been in there as it was replaced). I want to use a propylene
&gt; glycol based antifreeze instead of the ethylene glycol based stuff (or did
&gt; I just reverse that - I have already gotten 4 gallons of the stuff to use. The
&gt; container says that the two should not mix (which I will do when I get home,
&gt; I would like to see if it produces some nasty gums or the like), and to
&gt; flush the cooling system throughly before putting the new stuff in. So I
&gt; need to figure out two things- how do I get all the coolant out of the
&gt; system (like the raditor hoses that run to the front of the car), and then,
&gt; how do I get clean water to cycle through the system?
&gt;         The latter question I feel is a bit more difficult because I need to
&gt; get the raditor cleaned out which means getting water to run up there. My
&gt; only thoughts would be to remove the thermostat and let the car run a little
&gt; bit to force water through the whole system. Any one have any other ideas?

Dave,

Check the archives on this.  Flushing the system is pretty easy and
messy.  Basically, you need to install a &quot;T&quot; in the heater hose, I put
mine in above the spare tire, that will let you hook a garden hose to
it.  You can get this at any FLAPs.  Disconnect a big hose, run the
garden hose for a few minutes, connect the big hose and disconnect the
other big hose, run the garden hose again.  You will be left with about
a Gallon of water in the system so add a Gallon of antifreeze then top
it off with a 50/50 mix and bleed.

DON'T RUN THE ENGINE TO FLUSH, sounds like trouble to me.
