Rick -

DO NOT CUT THE WIRE HARNESS!  VDO makes the &quot;shortening&quot; statement only
because most of their end-consumers were shortening it to get rid of excess
harness.  What they really mean is NOT to modify the harness in any
fashionable way or you will definitely receive an inaccurate reading.  (I
Learned from experience).
