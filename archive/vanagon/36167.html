Subject: Cool Center Console

My wife and I were at Price Club/Costco on Saturday and ran across an
interesting item.  I had seen these for sale in Autoweek before but at a
much higher price.  Here is what it was.

Obviously made for a mini van,but don't see why it would not work in a bus.
Console to go between front two seats. Has some storage on the front and
places for drinks I think.

The back is what is interesting.  Has a 5&quot; color TV with a small VCR.  Also
has hook ups for video games.  Seems to be made of ABS plastic.  Pretty well
put together.  Plugs into cigarette lighter or could probably be hard wired.

Best of all.....Price---$299!!!

I just have to convince my wife.  This just seems like a really great deal.

This is the Costco located in Van Nuys, California.
