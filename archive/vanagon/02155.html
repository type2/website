Subject: Triple-square &lt;&gt; Torx

Careful.  Although some sizes of the six-point Torx series will fit in some
sizes of the twelve-point &quot;triple-square&quot; head that VW uses, they are not
the same, and can round off the triple-square teeth.  Get the real triple-
square bit even though Sears and FLAPS don't typically have it.
