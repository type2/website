Not intentionally, of course(  :)   ) but I got the Eurovan up to 100 mph 
on the interstate this past weekend.

Was trying to get away from a bunch of yahoos driving in a West Virginia 
'limo'. When I looked down the needle was passing 100 and the van was 
purring quite well. Was o where near the readline. (naturally I decreased 
the forward motion rather quickly)  :)
