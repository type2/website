 Subject: FS: 1975 VW Bus

  I have to sell my VW bus :(.
  IT is located with me here in Massachusetts.  It is a Kombi Camper and
  has full camper interior which includes, ice box, sink, pull out bed, and
  closet and storage space.  The bus has VERY little rust.  It is light
  blue.  It has 4 almost new all-weather tires and 2 brand new snow tires.
  I just had the dual relay valve, starter, and wiring replaced.  Its
  interior is very clean.
  $3000 or b.o.
  Laura
