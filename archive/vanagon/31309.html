Subject: EV: Michellins - 100....Conti's - 0!


As most of you know the east was hit with a big snow storm...well sort
of big...actually to tell the truth, around these parts as soon as there
is an announcement of more than 1&quot; of snow the natives panic ...

This summer I bought 4 new Michellin MXLs for the EuroVan to replace
the Contis that came with it. The Conti's SUCKED in the snow and
ice...little traction, and they got worse with wear. We went thru
3 winters with the Contis...

I have to report that the MXLs are 1000% better than the Contis ever
were! They handle packed snow, fresh snow, &gt;6&quot; deep snow, those piles
of snow left in the road when those inconsiderate idiots plow out
their driveways and leave a mound in the middle of the road...on and
on ad nauseum...

I was thinking of eventually buying some regular snows for the EV...but
I may reconsider.
