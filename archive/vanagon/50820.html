&gt; while the TriStars have rear passenger doors on both sides!!  Wish I had
&gt; one!!

This past August I spotted a Vanagon GL '91 or '92 in for service at a
local VW shop. This Vanagon had sliding doors on both sides.  When I
asked about this early Chry**** MiniV** invention, I was told that it
was a factory option. In this case for a man with a wheel chair. He had
a power lift mounted inside of the left sliding door.
