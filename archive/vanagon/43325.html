Subject: new to list

     hey all,
     
     not only am i new to this list, i'm new to this 'net stuff as 
     well..i've been reading everyone's posts and have learned alot...i 
     have a 74 bug and just read the weekly statz and consider myself a 
     &quot;Wanabus&quot; also.
     
     my question:  i think i can follow some of the abbreviations used and 
     if not have asked my more 'net experienced friends...one abbreviation 
     we (i) don't know if &quot;FLAPS&quot;.  i'm sure you can help me become more 
     'net worthy...
     
     thanks
