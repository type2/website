I just saw the news story about the bus wreck yesterday.

It was a mid-'60s kombi or standard, and it looks like the other car
hit it in the side, just behind the driver's door, on a path towards
the front/passenger side.

I had a &quot;discussion&quot; with my SO about whether they were wearing seat belts
or not.  She thinks seat belts are an automatic &quot;get out of death free&quot;
card.  They aren't.  They help, but when the other car parks in your lap,
there's not much you can do.

I don't know how much seat belts would have affected
the outcome of this accident - there was pretty heavy intrusion into the
cab of the bus, but the front end (nose) was relatively unscathed.

I am definitely going to see about putting belts into my bus now.
