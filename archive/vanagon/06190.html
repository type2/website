&gt; 	Regarding the 'aerospike' used in the Trident missle to increase
&gt; its streamlining by sticking a pole and a small deflector out front- I 
&gt; suspect that worked great above Mach 1 but not so well at the speeds
&gt; we usually drive our busses. But an experiment should be easy to put together...
&gt; Don't hit anybody with it though!

I'm also contemplating an extendable pole for use on the _side_ of the
bus to reduce the effect of those pesky crosswinds.
