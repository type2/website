Subject:      Re: oil temp?

Firstly, Dave Black asked:
&gt;What is 'normal' oil temperature for my '71?  I thought I might have
&gt;heard something like 180F, but when I drove my Bus up from Phoenix,
&gt;my recently installed gage showed a max of around 230F!  The sender
&gt;is located under the engine, where one of the plugs for the oil
&gt;bypass valve is located.

Then, David Schwarze said:
&gt;My book says that optimal oil temperature is around 180F, with 230
&gt;deemed acceptable and 270 not unheard of on race engines.  I have seen
&gt;mine hit 250 when going up hills in the desert in 100+ degree heat.
&gt;Now that I have the flaps removed, oil temp only goes over 200 on rare
&gt;occasions.

And David Carment chimed in with:
&gt;180 is probably the minimum run temp you will obtain in your engine.
&gt;Anything above 250 and  your oil may begin to lose its qualities.
&gt;solution? gauge is incorrect or look into a second oil cooler as a
&gt;solution if it persists, mind you engine could be running hot for other
&gt;reasons.

Now, Joel spake thusly:
i thought i had some book somewhere that spelled all this out nicely, but
have searched to no avail. however, i did run across an old article from
VW&amp;Porsche back in Sep/Oct 1984: Oiling Systems Basics.

in it, they say that &quot;the oil temperatures on stock Volkswagens ... runs
quite high, with 260 degrees Fahrenheit (130 Celsius) not an uncommon reading
...  With a standard, high quality, mineral-based oil, the rate of oil
oxidation doubles with every 18 degree increase in temperature.&quot;

cept they don't say if that's 18 degrees F or C!!!  they continue:
&quot;This oxidation doesn't become significant until the temperature exceeds
200 degrees.  ... Oxidation means that the lighter, more volatile components
of the oil break down and combine to create heavier molecules, the stuff that
eventually becomes sludge.&quot;
&quot;What this all means is that even with today's excellent antioxidant packages
and all of the other additives which major oil manufacturers include, an
engine with an oil temperature of 218 degrees will wear out the oil twice as
fast as an engine with temperatures closer to the recommended 200 degrees.&quot;
&quot;Running the oil at too low a temperature (below 190 degrees F) will cost
horsepower as well as reducing the lubricating efficiency, creating more
wear problems that it solves.&quot;

now. that sorta ties in my what my little grey cells remember. that 180F is
about as cold as you want to let the oil get, that 200F was about normal,
and even as high as 250F was ok, but not for extended periods. all of  this
ASSUMES that you change the oil every 3000 miles (5000km)!!!

another way of looking at oil, i'm told, is to look at the data sheet for the
oil in question, and check the Flash Point temperature. this is when the oil
will ignite. supposedly, you would like to keep the oil temp around half
this temp, and never over 3/4ths of this temp. which gets back to the
oxidation thing talked about above.

somewhere out in the FAQ is that oil stuff that someone on rec.autos.vw or
rec.autos.tech put out. so you might want to check for your particular brand
and weight of oil, and see how it fares.

but it all boils down to how long you let it stay hot, and how long you go
between changes. if you ran out to Death Valley in August, and the temp got
up to 300F for most of the day ... well, i think i'd feel like changing the
oil when i got back. ;)

the worst thing is that each engine type will show different temp ranges,
and the different bus models will also show different ranges with the same
engine. that is, a camper will run hotter (more strain and load) than a
same year, same engine kombi. and a pickup truck (unloaded, of course) will
show lower temps (less load and strain) than the same year, same engine
kombi.

so basically, it seems to be pretty much like batteries: PFM.
Pure Freaking Magic. nobody knows for sure, and everybody has their own
opinions and 'secrets'.
