Alistair Bell contrived:
&gt; anybody out there want to describe the
&gt; modifications made to their elec. system?
&gt; extra batteries, battery selector switches,
&gt; uprgraded wiring etc.

No, but I'd like to install phasers and photon
torpedo weaponry.   ;)

&gt; 
&gt; oh and btw, am i the only one who when
&gt; seening another van, wonders if the owner is
&gt; a subscriber to this group?
&gt; (no, i'm not suggesting secret handshakes, or
&gt; morse code headlight flashing)
&gt; 

Judging by the number of people in my area, the chances are
very slim.  I'm lucky if they even look back, let alone
wave.
