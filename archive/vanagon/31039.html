&gt; Here is the initial failure report;
&gt; 
&gt; AirCare Inspection Report
&gt; 1984 VW Westfalia, 205,000 kms.
&gt; 
&gt; HC_at_load (ppm) :  Actual:  115  Permitted: 300
&gt; HC_at_idle (ppm) :  Actual:  367  Permitted: 350  FAIL
&gt; 
&gt; CO_at_load (%) Actual 0.91  Permitted 2.00
&gt; CO_at_idle (%) Actual 0.42  Permitted 4.00
&gt; 
&gt; NOx_at_load (ppm)  Actual 1450  Permitted 2667
&gt; 

Sounds like all you need is to have them bring up the CO slightly.  This 
will bring down the HCs and you'll be fine.
