Subject: Good Dealers Exist!

In a recent posting, one listmember made the following comment:

&quot;We bought a 1991 Vanagon GL and had signed the paper on the dotted line with
the expectancy of the curtains to be in the car and the damn dealer yipped
them before giving it to us.  The previous owner even told us to get the
curtains from them.  Dealers suck!!&quot;

I am prompted to make the following comments in reaction to especially the 
statement &quot;Dealers suck!&quot;

I am in the process of purchasing a '91 Westy - sight unseen - from a dealer
in Minnisota. We have developed a nice friendship over the phone and FAX. I
have been very pleased with all of the details of the 'deal'. But I am a 
knowledgable purchaser (having owned 2 Westies prior to this) and I am a
detailed person.

First, I FAXed the dealer (4 pages long) of detailed questions on the Westy.
Things like &quot;front privacy curtain&quot; and &quot;rear hatch screen&quot; were on the list.
I asked 1) it the item was in the van and 2) the condition of the item. To
all of these he responded and we discussed any items that needed to be taken
care of. For example, I asked him to do the following checks and repair if
necessary:

1-Check the air conditioner and recharge if necessary
2-Fill the gas tank and watch for any signs of leakage from the fuel overflow
  hoses.

He agreed to do these checks and insure the viability of these systems (known
to be problematic)

Second, I had the good fortune to fine a list member who agreed to take a look
at the Westy for me. He is knowledgable in that he is currently rebuilding an
'88 and really knows his stuff. With his report in hand I went back to the
on some items. The front privacy curtain was missing, the dealer agreed to find
it or replace it with a new one. We had a little go around on this because his
parts man tried to say that since it was only listed for the '88 in the service
details, it was an 'option' for the later models. I was able to make my case -
he called the PO and found out that it 'should have been in the van' and agreed
to order a new one. (But the PO called back to apologize as he had found it in
his house.) 

The tail pipe was 'rusted' and the dealer replaced it at his cost.
There is some minor body work that needs to be done (rust spots). I got a quote
from my local dealer's body shop on this at a max cost of $800-1000. and the
dealer agreed to meet me half way on this by dropping the price $500.

In addition, the dealer is 'installing' 4 new VW Alloys and all parts for 
actual 'dealer cost' of the parts. I am supplying the tires (drop shipped to
him). He also gave me a discount on a new VW bra and tossed in that pesky
overpriced plastic gas exhaust cover for free.

We are currently working out the 'warranty' details and final purchase arrange-
ments so that I will own the Westy on or about the day the shipper pickes it
up for transport.

At this point I am very pleased with the deal. But I have had to be responsible
for making sure that the details I am concerned with have been covered. It is
the buyers responsibility to ask the right questions and make sure that they
are answered to his/her satisfaction. Most credable dealers will work with
you on this. It is the buyers responsibility to build a realtionship with the
dealer that works - otherwise the ole&quot;buyer beware&quot; kicks in.

Both my local dealer - with whom I have had a full 2 year relationship with -
and this distant dealer that I am working with are good people who are willing
to work WITH me on meeting my needs. But it is a 2 WAY RESPONSIBILITY when
you are buying anything.

AND I would advise that it SHOULD be the same when you buy direct from a PO.

Kenyon

PS-I am also FAXing the dealer a check off sheet for all of the loose items
that are being shipped back inside the Westy. The shipper has to sign for
all of those internal items when he picks up the Westy - and I will not accept
the Westy until I have checked that all are there upon receipt. More details,
but my investment insurance!
