Subject: fs...1970 westfalia

hi..Jimbo here..spotted a 70 westy out this way (near NYC) for sale. It is

on a lot about 45 minutes out of the city. The guy is asking $2995. Now this

is a lot considering the brakes are shot (there is no fluid in the res!), the motor has an awful clanking sound (with a rhytym one can dance to) and the the white
paint job doesn't match the original cream color under the fiberglass. I offered him 1500, he said no. I told him the word is out on this bus ( a lot of people have contacted me) and that only an uninformed being is gonna pay this
canvas...body is straight and solid, but has been hit in left nose. No progressive
 rust, a little bondo on nose only..email me for more info and exact location
/phone...jimbo.
