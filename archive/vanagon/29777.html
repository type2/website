Subject: Two Tank Syncro

Vanamaniacs!

I saw a silver Syncro ('87) in the used car lot at Burnsville VW on Monday
and stopped to ask about it.  They couldn't tell me much though.  It seems
that when they came to work one morning last week someone had left it in in
the lot!  They've tried to contact the owner, but can't.

But anyway, when I was looking at it I saw the gas filler at the back where
it supposed to be on a Syncro and another in the front as on a non-Syncro.
 Was this an option?  Or did the owner do some modifications?  This would be
great for long trips!  Wouldn't want to pay for the fill-ups though:-).

Later!

Brad
