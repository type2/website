&gt;Just completed a motor swap on a '76 bus.  Now I _think_ I have 
&gt;everything wired correctly, but injectors 3 &amp; 4 aren't getting a 
&gt;signal.  I tried swapping the brain, air flow meter, dual relay, 
&gt;and the resister pack above the dual relay. Tried reversing the 
&gt;3 &amp; 4 injector wiring, just for the heck of it. 
&gt;Also checked the standard stuff (points, plugs, compression, etc.), 
&gt;which is how I deduced that the problem was an electrical fuel 
&gt;injection one. (Compression is 150 lbs all around, and all 
&gt;cylinders are definately getting strong spark, but 3 &amp; 4 aren't 
&gt;firing. The injectors are bone dry, and they do have continuity.)
&gt;
&gt;Before I start tearing into the wiring harness tomorrow, is there 
&gt;anything else I might have missed?  Any suggestions? 

All four injectors are actually wired in parralell.  Check the conectors
themselves as the contacts sometimes slide out.
