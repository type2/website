Subject: Zoning for VW Junk .. er .. Parts

Sorry to hear that you may be leaving Missouri.  Springfield has a local 
ordinance against non-operative or unlicensed vehicles also.  I have had 
the authorities threaten me more than once.  I live just outside of 
Springfield, but some of the Busses live at a house my folks have in 
town.  I had three really bad looking parts Busses there once and the 
neighbors went nuts.  Now if the Bus is titled I just buy a $25 historic 
vehicle plate, slap it on and I'm now legal.  I have just the Vanagon at 
my house, two Busses at the folks house in Springfield, one at a storage 
rental, one at a friend's house, and two more at my folks house in St. 
Thomas, MO.  My wife has her own set of ordinances you see ...  ;-)

&gt; FLAPS, for example.  I have problems here in Missouri with the local
&gt; city codes, as it pertains to storage of spare VW parts, so I plan to
&gt; study local codes before deciding on whether to settle in a particular
&gt; municipality or not.
