Q. What do you have when you have 50 lawyers burried up to their necks
in sand?

A. Not enough sand


 
Attorney John Jones died and went to heaven. At his arrival at the pearly
gates he saw a sign that read: &quot;Welcome John Jones....We are honored
by your presence&quot;...

So old John Jones walks up to Saint Peter and introduces himself...
and St. Peter responds &quot;What an honor it is to meet you...&quot;

John Jones, stunned, replied &quot;I don't understand what the fuss is
all about...I was nothing more than a big city lawyer...nothing
special..&quot;

St. Peter replied &quot;We research the background to all of our
guests....and our sources obtained your files from your office, and
according to your billable hours, you are over 175 years old...
clearly the oldest person ever to enter heaven!!&quot;
