&gt;MG, Triumph, Peugeot, Renault, Citroen, Opel (another
&gt;GM fiasco), Fiat,  Yugo (well ... ) ... any others?

&gt;Eeek!  Joel, I hope that Galvo doesn't read this ...

&gt;.. he is an Opel-fruit.  Say anything bad about his Opel is
&gt;like maligning my Transporter - it's not done if you value 
your life.

&gt;You have been warned ... :&gt;


Ah, but he did read it!
Just how do you define 'fiasco'. In Ireland, Opel regularly 
swap number one seller status with Ford (bleah!) and Toyota 
(urrgh!). In England, they are a solid number two to Ford and 
making good money in the process. They were operating at a loss 
a few years ago but at that time so were most. To the best of 
my knowledge Ford of Europe is still making a loss.
Opel don't make the best-handling cars but since Wayne Cherry 
took over the design end they look well. They have always 
driven well and the engines are as strong as anything else (VW 
included). My Vectra has the Two litre 16 valve engine designed 
by Cosworth. Before I bought it I had my heart set on a Golf 
VR6 but I was quoted IRP 7,000 for insurance (about 12,000 
dollars I think). Last year a used VR6 came on the market and 
when I drove it I wondered what was wrong with it. It turns out 
the VR6 isn't that much faster than my Opel.
The Bushrat can also testify to the handling of my car on ice. 
We've had a spell of very cold weather here recently - snow, 
sleet and ice. P.J. was beside me when I drove in to my house 
yesterday. There's a T-junction just outside my driveway and as 
I came up to it, I hit the handbrake hard. As realisation 
dawned, the bushrat shouted &quot;Mind that Audi!!!&quot; (typical of a 
bushrat even when his life is flashing before him to think only 
of VAG.
The car pirhouetted gracefully on the ice through 180 degrees a 
la Pentii &quot;I like to go sidevays&quot; Airikkala and ended up with 
it's backside pointed at my drive. I just had to flick it into 
reverse and I was in the drive.
The bushrat was livid as the last time he tried this trick he 
ended up in a wall.
And the moral is - If you want to Ice Skate you need GM.
