So Joel Only-mis-interpreted-me-once-today Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; all 1986-1991 vanagons, the ones with the squared headlights, use a
&gt; replaceable halogen bulb ... i think it's a 9004 or something like that.
&gt; used to be hard to find, costs about $20 each.

I see them on sale occasionally for just under $10.

&gt; so you don't really even have &quot;sealed&quot; beam headlights.

I KNOW 'I' DON'T HAVE SEALED BEAMS!!  Gimme a break Joel. ;)  I was asking
whether or not the sealed beams on the earlier vans were sealed.  Sheesh!
