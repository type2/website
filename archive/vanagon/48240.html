Subject: Towing Hitches for Westies....

Hi All,

Thanks for all the advice I received a while back about replacement P/S 
racks for the Westie.  One of the list members put me in touch with a 
machine shop all the way down in Texas, the southern hospitallity came 
through mega style!  I sent them my old rack FedX 2nd day air, I had it 
back here in Alaska the following week *Looking like new* for under $300 
including shipping, they even knocked the price down for me to give me  
a break for the FedX costs, great deal-nice folks!

Anyway, I'm off down to Seattle next week and hoping to pick up a tow 
bar/hitch for the old girl.  Does anyone know of a good *fit yerself* 
make that may be available in the big city?  I'm open to any and all 
advice.

Don't really intend towing with it though, maybe a small trailer.  I 
would like to put one of those luggage racks/bike rack thingies on it?

Thanks,

Chris Gibbs 88 Westie with new P/S.  Thanks again!
