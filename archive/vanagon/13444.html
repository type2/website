Subject: Cut off Jets

Just had my van back from the shop after a tune up (82 air cooled,2litr,twim carb)
It seems that one of my elecromagnetic cut-off jets is not working. Muir says
they are a waste of time and can be replaced by a screw in jet.
Anyone got advice on this. Can I replace one or should I replace both, or just
stick with an electronic cut-off jet replacement? Will my carbs need balancing 
again once I do these replacements?

Put in my first tank of unleaded last night, still running better than ever.
