 Howdy, all...
 I am a bit concerned about a part on my engine that I am unable to
identify. I have a 1.7l pancaker with dual-carbs and the part in
question is some type of heat-switch located under the engine on the
passenger's side. It's a round thing with a cable coming out (which
isn't presently connected to anything. Should I be worried about this?
 Is it part of the heating system? If so, it won't be much help any
more. (I just finished manufacturing a *COMPLETE* exhaust system out
of a set of headers, thus no more heat exchangers to worry about...)
 Thanx
