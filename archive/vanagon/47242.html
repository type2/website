Subject: Weekend Fun/Need RPM's

        Hello listies. Well I succesfully installed a tach in the ol van so
I can finally see just how Mr.Motor is running. The gauge was only $30 from
Crappy Tire, my kinda FLAP in a pinch..would that be FLAPIAP?? Anyhow its a
nice small black gauge that I decided to mount just to the right of the
regular gauge panel. It stuck on rather nicely with a piece of double sided
tape, plus it allows me to remove it at a later date. :)
        The install wasnt to bad, although I did have to call over a freind
who was a bit more adept at the wiring than I, and once he saw the wiring
diagram in Bentely my wiring woes were solved. ABout the only real
difficulty I did encounter was trying to run the wire the whole way up to
the front, and finding a place to bring it up through the panelling. I
finally found a place, after removing the spare tire and windsheild fluid
resevoir, that lead the wire up behind the panelling under the
stereo/radio.
        So now I have an RPM gauge...but.....I need to know what sort of
RPM's I should be running at, and thats where you all come in. :) SO if
some kind person could gimmie that peice o' knowledge I would be much
obliged.
        I also managed to get an oil change done, although Id like to
strangle the punk who tightened the oil filter on with a 2km long leverage
bar. AAAAAArgh.
        Tried that anti-brake squeel stuff on the front brakes, and
suprisingly enough it seems to work. They sure do give you alot of that
stuff for $3. I could probably do about 12 pads with the amount they pack
in there, although maybe that means you have to keep putting the damn stuff
on all the time. :( Never thought of that.

        And on a bad note I managed to strip a wheel bolt. I freind kindly
told me come by his place of employment later this week and we'll re-tap
the top, screwed up(no pun intended) part.
