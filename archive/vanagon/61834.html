Subject: Oettenger motor

     Picked up a book (Brookings?) with a bunch of reprinted articles on 
     Vanagons.
     
     Amazed at the story on the Oettenger 6 cylinder wasserboxer which, I 
     recall gave about 50% more horsepower and got 24 MPG.
     
     Has anyone had first-hand experience with one of these?  Was the 
     quantity prduced microscopically small?
