So gt4954b_at_prism.gatech_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; while driving my bus today i noticed a significant oil leak over the left
&gt; exhaust manifold.  i have yet to determine where it is coming from, so any
&gt; suggestions would be really helpful.  this is a major worry for me, as you
&gt; probably understand.
&gt; 

Places to check are:

Valve covers - bottom lip.

Push-rod tube ends.  Gaskets not sealing.

Oil cooler - :(

Good Luck

Steven
