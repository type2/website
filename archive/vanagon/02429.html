Subject: I'm a procrastinator




	A while ago I said that I would summerize (not winterize),
	the conversion I did to my van (diesel to gas).
	I even went as far as to say that I would V-tape
	the engine compartment. 
	Well I have done neither yet.
	Sorry to all of you that expressed interest
	earlier, and please let me know if you are still
	interested.

	Alistair (it'll wait) Bell
