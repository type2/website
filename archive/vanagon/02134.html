&gt;I think California would be your best bet for getting a hold of a good
&gt;running camper and the further Northeast you go, the more money could be

If you get a '65 or earlier, smog is not an issue - they're exempt.  Like
I've mentioned before, the only REAL busses are pre '68.

BTW - when will this trip actually take place?  I didn't really pay much
attention 'cause I though it was a real soon thing, but If you guys are 
talkin' spring, then my baby might be ready...
