Subject: Cetin's Freeport (Excellent?) Adventure

Cetin writes regarding the yuppie traffic around LL Bean Land:
&gt;....my wife insisted on stopping at least once


Cetin...the only known cure for your wife's &quot;transgression of 
discretion&quot; is to strap her to a recently refinished brewer's
chair which was purchased at a yard sale, tape her eyelids
open (a la Clockwork Orange) and force her to watch an endless
loop tape of &quot;Martha Stewart's Living&quot;....

;-)

PS - Glad to hear your trip went well....did you get to see the
ghost ships of Wiscassett?
