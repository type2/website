Subject: Re: Warm air from under dash.

I've never been able to detect ANY flow on my '86 from this lever.  It's
only use (I can tell) is to reduce the VERY loud &quot;rushing air noise&quot; 
from the dash when all the other levers are closed.  It seems desirable
to keep this closed when running the A/C, but I can't stand the noise ...

 &gt;The REAR CEILING AIR FLOW is controlled by the bottom (#4) lever.  Left is
 &gt;open, right is closed.  Rear ceiling air is not heated.  (Again, there's a
 &gt;little picture trying to convey this.)
