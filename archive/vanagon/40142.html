Subject: Bike Racks

Below is a summary of the information re bike racks that I received from various interested and 
helpful listees.  Some of you who responded wanted to know what I found out, so here it is.

Apparently the bike rack I was inquiring about is made by Paulchen.  It is made in Germany; not 
imported to the US but is imported to Canada.  These racks cost in the $400 range, are available in 
a variety of configurations, and are sold by a number of dealers in the Vancouver, BC area and by 
dealers in Ontario.  I heard from no one who actually has this rack but several respondents would 
really like one.

Others reported on less expensive brands that fit their needs quite satisfactorily.  Below are 
selections from a list that was compiled previously and sent to me.  These are available in many 
bike stores everywhere in the US.  A number of respondents suggested visiting local bike stores for 
their opinions.

Wyers StealthRak  $69.99
        Frame rests only on the bumper.  Looks like it could be used for bus front or rear.  Holds 
	up to three bikes.  This seems like the best designed unit for bus applications.
Rhode Gear    model 'Super Shuttle'   $90
   fits all vehicles (that's the claim, anyway). for Vanagons it's great!

FASTRAK by Blackburn - i'd guess 50-75$ (i won it)
   (Alexey Davies &lt;hi_at_drmail.dr.att_dot_com&gt; 1982 Vanagon)

In the Colorado Cyclist Catalog Late Summer 1995 edition I came across
many racks.   1 800 688 8600

Hollywood Rack  SR-1 Spare Tire Rack  $74.99
    This would work for front of busses with spare tire.  Holds two bikes and adjusts laterally to 
	center on wheel.
There are hitch racks as well.  These run from $129.99 to $199.99 and
come in two, three or four bike capacity.
