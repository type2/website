&gt;OK, let's have a show of hands.....how many campers are the
&gt;boil-in-bag types, and how many of us keep a dutch oven under
&gt;the jump seat and charcoal under the bed?

Well, we're neither. Maria 'n' I love to eat out, *especially* when
we're on the road. It's not a cheap hobby, but we figure that we save
enough dough by camping and not staying in hotels. (But, hey, that doesn't
mean we're sissies, OK? I'll flip those burgers just like any other
Midwestern, baseball cap-wearing, beer-pounding, jock-scratching, and macho
belcher out there.)&lt;grin&gt;

So, any other &quot;gourmets&quot; out there??
