Subject:      Other lists, Rabbit's, etc

Having not had a gas VW in about 25 yrs, and purchasing one (`84 Rabbit)
for my son, I find myself a bit gas challenged when I talk to him. I've
looked at all the links at vanagon_dot_com and type2_dot_com but everything I've
come up with seem to be uninhabbited (as compared to OUR list). Anyone know
of a good one?
