Subject: how to break into van....etc

when you guys left the pinup in the van......

i was thinking about other ways to leave a little message without the 
posibility of offending people with something that could be construde as 
sexist.......

leave a note that says ;


did you ever see the end of the movie &quot;The Mechanic&quot; with charles bronson?

well, your 25 seconds in our parking lot are up.....

                               bang!!!! 


a friend



it might get the adreniline flowing, and may not bring the cops into the 
picture, and wouldn't be a direct asault on someones gender.
