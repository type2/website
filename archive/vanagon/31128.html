&gt; Mark,

&gt; Thanks for the offer but I'm still unsure what I'm looking for. Right now 
&gt; I'm still trying to determine what exactly it is that I want/need (2WD, 4WD, 
&gt; Westie) to get me to mountain bike races in New England this coming summer 
&gt; (loading up the '91 Golf can be quite the trick with  bikes, a passenger or 
&gt; two, and misc bike and camping gear)!
&gt; 
A way to mount two bikes inside a Westie
-get two fork mounts($30 each at a bike shop, or better, improvise) and 
attach them to the storage box 
face under the back seat.  Without the front wheels in place, this works
pretty well for my Cannondale MT bike, but,of course only allows for two 
to three people to ride, and little movement in the cabin, ...but it's 
good for the bikes.
-alternative is to put one mount on the box face below the back of the 
front passenger seat to put the bikes in alternating....
