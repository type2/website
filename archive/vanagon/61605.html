Subject: Engine Chugging...


I just got Muir's new book, and I was trying to follow it to help me find 
my problem.  I've got a 1980 westy, and the engine is chugging:

When started it won't stay started unless I give it a little gas
then it will even out.

It goes: Room, Room, (the good normal sound)  and then a few Chug, Chug 
sounds like it is going to stall, but then picks back up into an idle.

This goes on continually unless it has been driven far, and it is 
REAL warmed up.  

Any mechanics or well-trained vanagon owners have any suggestions.
Or maybe places to start looking. (I'm just learning, but I'm getting 
better) 

Thanks,

	Kyle
