Well, we had a successful trip down to cape Hatteras (N.C.) and points 
south.  Just to recap:  Left Boston, MA on friday nite.  Overnight N.J.
Then on to V.A. Beach (2 nights) then to Ocracoke Island (just south of 
Hatteras Island) - 3 nights.  Then on to Charleston, S.C. back up to 
Huntington Beach (1 night in Charleston, 2 nights in Huntington) then back
to Virginia (somewhere just south of Washington D.C.) up to N.J. (friends see
above-1 night ) then up to upstate N.Y. (1 night) then home last night.
All in my '65 micro deluxe!  
(about 2500 miles/11 days, 1&amp;1/4 quarts of oil, many tanks of gas, slightly 
bruised right index knuckle [from shifting into 3rd from second])

	Only problems:  Speedo cable failed about half way into N.C. - the 
square end that goes through the grease cap on the front drivers side wheel
had become rounded.- cured this by bending the cotter pin leg back on itself
and into on of the square corners of the hole in the grease cap.  An added 
measure of securing- duct tape over.  
The starter would not engage when we stopped for some roadside shrimp on
the virginia part of the DelMarVa pennisula.  My fuse would short out everytime
I tried to engage the started.  Bummer... Jumped started and continued on to
VA beach with the intention of getting all greasy that nite playing with the 
starter/wiring.  This problem disappeared never to happen again.  Started up
at the campsite with no problem.  (I don't know what caused this).  That 
WAS IT!  What a sweet machine.......
