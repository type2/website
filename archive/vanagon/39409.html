     I have an 82 with a semi-new engine, and live in Denver.  My temps 
     also range from 180-210, hotter on the steeper climbs.  The guy I 
     bought the engine from suggested I install a Mesa External Oil cooler, 
     72 pane at least, and install it at a 45 degree angle in the cavity 
     under the sliding door.  This keeps it higher off the ground, 
     protecting it from the hazards of 'off road' but still in air flow.
     
     Anyone done something like this?
