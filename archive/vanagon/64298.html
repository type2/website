&lt;&lt; VW WESTFALIA CAMPER 86, sink, stove, fridge, never used, very good
 shape, mint, 1 owner, $5000 or best offer. (203) 367-0711 . Bridgeport &gt;&gt;

Vanagoners:

Suzy and I have joined your ranks!!! She will be the one wearing the big grin
in her 1976 Bus (almost finished with refirbish). I will be the one in the
1986 Westy.

The owner NEVER USED any of the camping equip. NEVER!!! In fact, he just
removed the dessicant packages from the fridge and stove, and all is still
covered with VW plastic. : ) He never filled the tanks (H20 or propane).
Auto, cold AC, perfect tent, screens, and interior. No rust.

About 9,000 on new pistons, rings, and heads, (by VW). New brakes all around
and new exhaust. Brown and tan (okay, so I REALLY wanted the white and white,
but...). 88k total miles.

Needs:

New tires all around (current tires by Telly Sevallis),
New fuel pump (sat for a year)  : (
New Power steering rack  : (

Now we just have to get rid of Sue's Toy-Yoda, (so we have some $$$!) and get
the parts (are you listening Ron Solomon? Send me a price!).

Yeah! a fridge that doesn't work in the mountains, a drippy heater core,
crazy chores: drop the radiator, repaint the lugnuts, flush the water tank
out, worry about the head gaskets, watch the temp gauge like hawk, find some
magician who can figure out the coolent system flush method, replace the this
and the that...tinker, tinker, tinker. : )

Can you tell I am a little excited?  We will go up in a couple of weeks to
repair/pick up our new (old) VW, pending the condition being as reported on
the phone. SOLD! Sight unseen.

My Pop warned me about that...But HIS Pop warned him about building a house
on sand, and his place is on the beach in Baja!!!

Gotta go, sleepless night ahead.
