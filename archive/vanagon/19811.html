To All:

I missed the specifics of a message that blipped across the system sometime
this morning with regard to battery powered buses.

There is an organization called the Electric Auto Association with a number
of local chapters.  They publish a newsletter titled Current EVents (sic).

Ms. Shari Prange is the co-author of 'Convert It', a how-to manual describing
the conversion of vehicles to battery power.  It so happens Ms Prange sells
many of the conversion items mentioned in her book.
She may be reached at Electro Automotive, POB 1113, Felton, CA 95018.  Her
book costs about $30; she offers a catalog for $5.

This information was extracted from the Feb 1994 issue of 'Nuts &amp; Volts
Magazine' and my be completely out of date.

-Bob
