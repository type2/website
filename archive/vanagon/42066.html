Never!

 &gt; let me 
 &gt; emphasize that I used the CORRECT (read snug-fitting) METRIC allen wrench 
 &gt; and had no problem. Of course, maybe my technique is a little better 
 &gt; than Berry's...or maybe the fact that the 12-point screw heads weren't 
 &gt; jammed on with guerilla force has something to do with it.

Hey, if it works it's fine.  The right metric Allen wrench *ought* to work.  
Mine were put on by muscule-bound black forest gnomes in a &quot;who can torque 
this the most and not snap the head off&quot; contest and then allowed to sit and 
corrode for 12 years.

At least that's the only teory I can come up with that explains my travails.

 &gt; If you do try 
 &gt; the allen wrench, make sure it fits tight...and give up and go get 
 &gt; Berry's 12-point, gold filled Snap-On right BEFORE the head strips

Good advice.  NO flames from *me*.  But be sure NOT to strip things.  No fun 
at all.
