Subject: 68-71 Gas Heater Curious

Hello all!

I'm curious about the location of the gas heater heat outlet on a 68-71 
Campmobile.  I know those Eberspacher heaters are mounted on the driver's 
side of the engine compartment and there is some metal ducting bringing 
the heat into the van, but all the pictures I've seen are on passenger 
vans and not Westy's.  How was that ducting orignally routed through the 
storage area under the fold down bed?  Was a hole cut in the face of 
the storage area in-line with the ducting or was the camper equipment 
different on gas heater equipped models?

Curiously yours,
