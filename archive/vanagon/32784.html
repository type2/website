&gt; I know that the benz dealer I used (for an old 240D) had everything on

Well if you want everything on disk...

#define PLUG

The company I work for, AlllData, sells CD-ROMS will all the parts diagrams,
procedures, TSB, recall info, yada yada yada on CD-ROM.  Its $25 per make
and model, ie. $25 for your '86 westy, and $25 for your '95 911 turbo.
We have a web page, but i can't remember the exact URL right now, but you
can do a search for &quot;alldata&quot; and come up with it...  You can also
send mail to info_at_alldata_dot_com

Unfortunately, this stuff only goes back to '82.  I'm working from the inside
to have them move back to '35, at least for air cooled VW's :)

#undef PLUG

Yes, I am connected to AllData - I'm their SysAdmin.

My work address is tfitzpat_at_alldata_dot_com
