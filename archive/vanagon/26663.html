Subject: Famous van drivers...

I use a video about Mother Teresa of Calcutta in my courses. In one scene,
when she is visiting Guatemala, she is driven around in something that
looks like a cross between a bus and a pickup with a cap (a split cab??).
She also won the Nobel Peace Prize. Coincidence or design-you decide!
