Ric thus stated:

&gt;There is one major advantage to that lower engine cover on the EV...it keeps

&gt;99% of the road dirt, water, etc. from comming into the engine

I thought you were going to say that it helped streamline the bottom of the
EV; hey, remember the EV GT thread?  well, picture this:  an EV with a 
smooth, seamless bottom w/ ground effects,  lowered about 3&quot; or so.
Can we say vacuum cleaner?  Hey, maybe they should produce, what, 500
of 'em and go racing in the WSC Touring Car championship.  The Volvo 850
SW ain't got nuthin' on the EV!   ;-)
