Subject: ignition switch and seat belts

I agree with Mark McCulley and Jim Davis that a new ignition
switch will help with starting. A few years back I use to own
a '65 beetle that was having difficulty starting. It seemed
like it was the ignition switch so I replaced it. The switch only
had one screw holding it in place. The new switch solved the
problem, started right up. So out of curiosity I took the old
switch apart, sure enough all the little bumps that make the
electrical contact were worn down and one was black and pitted.
Must of been the one that carried all the juice to the starter.
Well &quot;all the juice&quot; in a six volt system is kinda relative.

In the same beetle I installed a set of used seat belts that I
had found in a junk yard. Non-retactable ones that worked fine,
made me feel secure. I would set the belt and would move the 
seat to adjust for different clothing.
