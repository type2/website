Subject: Re: Good compression, blue smoke?

&gt;My '66 (with a '74 engine) shows good compression, but kicks out blue smoke
&gt;after sitting for a few days.  The smoke stops after a few seconds.

Oil leaking into your combustion chamber from the heads, probably around
the valve guides.  How much oil do you go through?  One quart every 1000
miles? 500 miles? 250 miles?
