&gt; What is the timing light supposed to show you? I bought a cheap one
&gt; at Sear's, got it all hooked up... sure enough, it emits a light, but
&gt; so what? What am I supposed to be seeing? Muir and the instruction
&gt; book that came with the light are vague, at best.

The purpose of the light is to let you see when you turn the distributor.
Since its usually dark in the engine compartment, its to help make it
a little easier.  They use a strobe light because timing lights were 
first invented in the 70's, and it went well with the mirror ball.

Seriously, tho:  The light flashes each time the spark plug its hooked
to fires.  It should be on the #1 wire.  It will show you how the timing
mark is aligned with the case.  When you rotate the distributor, 
you'll see the alignment shift.
