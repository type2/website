Subject: '72 weird starting problem

Hey Now All,
I am visiting my best friend up here in Minneapolis MN, and he has a 
'72 westy, typical Minnesota look, loads o'rust. Well this bus doesn't 
look that great but runs like a dream. Except over the past few days it 
has been doing the strangest thing, it won't start sometimes. It has 
been very damp and humid and rainy here, turn the key and nothing or 
maybe a minor click, throw a starter 60amp on it and she fires right 
up, next time starts great, no ryhme or reason to when it starts or 
doesn't. The battery seems to be holding a full charge and the 
alternator seems to be doing it's job. I advised him to clean his 
terminals (having had a bus for 2 1/2 weeks myself I am now qualified 
to give free unrequested advise). So he is doing that this morning, 
could the high humidity have something to do with this problem?
Anyone else ever have this occur?
Thanks,
Peace,
Scoob
