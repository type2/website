Subject: Re: Tire update on Yokohama Y370G

&gt; I decided to purchase Yokohama Y370G tires 
(LT 195/75 R 14 Load Range D). Harry Yates is absolutely sold on these 
tires and I had the local dealer order a complete set of tires for me 
and a friend who also needed tires for his camper.&lt;

So I got the FAQ's, read the web pages, and went looking for some Yokohamas.

Yokohama (yellow page 800 nbr) said the Y370G is a passenger tire?  is this
true?

The tire discount place listed on the VW web didn't even have a record of
370's.
The guy at Sears just cocks his head and said &quot;the book said I can only sell
you 185/r14's&quot;

Is there another model number that is equivalent? What am I missing?

Thanks in advance?
