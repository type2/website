Subject: Re: in defense of grits!


I have been living in Georgia for eight years.  I also lived in Maryland and 
Virginia before that but never had grits before.  I know that it is made with
corn and looks like wallpaper paste when ready to eat.  The first (and last!)
time I had them was when I was in the hospital for an overnight stay last year.
It was the biggest part of the breakfast.  I don't know how people eat this
stuff!  Of course they say it is great if you add maple syrup, brown sugar,
jelly, cheese, etc, etc, etc.  My feeling is that if you have to add that
stuff to make it tolerable then it's tasteless.  I can eat plain oatmeal
anyday but not plain grits.  Just my opinion.
