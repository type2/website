Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 8-May-95 dashboard fan? by
&quot;Wagner Michael&quot;_at_macmail 

&gt; I'd sure like to install a small dashboard fan to make the
&gt; summer traffic a little more comfortable -- anybody done this?
&gt; any advice? things not to do? Gracias

Man, I _JUST_ did this in The Slug (83 diesel vanagon)
Drilled thru the plastic onna dash down to the metal unnerneath.
Attempted to use the cheesey little sheet metal screws that were
included with the fan and promptly found that they really are made out
of cheese.
Threw them away, and my fan is now happily mounted with drywall screws.

   Are drywall screws not the coolest fastener around? I LOVE drywall 
   screws!

Works like a charm, and I get to brag about having 'air conditioning'  Harf!

I think I  paid around $9 for the fan at Wal-Mart. 
YMMV.

   Was it sold as an automotive part? Did the wiring pose any problems?
   Thanks for the information!
