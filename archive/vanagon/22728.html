Subject: Bay Area used parts

	Down here in the bottom of the bay :) I'd like to recomend

	VW Used Parts Center
	1745 Villa Stone Drive
	San Jose, CA 95125

	They're just across and Almaden Expressway from A Foriegn, who
are themselves just down the way from Pick N Pull.

	Couple of weeks ago, my brother and I went in search of
the support for the stock air-cleaner for my '70, etc. Pick N Pull, 
on Montery Highway, just south of Alma, supplied lock cylinders for 
$3 each, charged $-2-3 for the various reflector and turn-signal lenses 
I picked up for hoarding/trading purposes. Bargan of the day was
a front rubber mat for $1.50. 
	One of their cars had the shelf that holds the air cleaner,
but I didn't have any super sharp bits and the rechargable drill I
was carrying ran out of poop after 7 1/2  1/4&quot; or thereabouts holes
through the spot-welds. About half way, I'd say.

	So we tried A Foriegn and they didn't have it, just the
air-cleaners in abundance. Finally, Ian led me to VW Used Parts Center,
having not been there in 10 years.

	This place is bizare and wonderful- its a little house
that's full of old VW parts. Water and air-cooled. The entrance is
through the back gate, around the corner and past the big old sleeping
dog. I described what I wanted to one guy and another guy, who was on
the phone, said &quot;In the gazebo, near the door&quot;. Sure enough, in the
gazebo, near the door, and only required a little climb up the waist-high
pile of brake drums and rear axles, the first guy found the piece
I need, which had been neatly removed from a donor vehicle. $20.


	Oh yeah, while we were in Pick N Pull with an electric drill,
we indulged a sick collector's instinct and got the little aluminum
factory ID plates off a Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV-
I got the odd numbers, Ian got the even. 


	Wierdly enough, Pick N Pull wouldn't let me take a camera
into the junk yard to photograph the bracket in place- nor could they
explain why not, just it was their policy. Anyone have a clue why???
