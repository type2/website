Subject: air vent repair

hello guys and dolls....
I pulled the vent cover off ('65 microdelux) the front of the air duct.  HOH
was always leaking in during a drive in the rain.  The PPO siliconed the 
gutters along the front (OUCH!) but this didn't do the trick.  Turns out the
seal (rubber) was in poor shape (What'd ya want for 30 year old rubber) and
the set screws from the lever to flap was loose.  Never closed all the way!
SO, I'm rehabing it.   Sand-blasted the rusted, pitted flap and will prime/
paint it tonight.  I noticed on the driver's side of the flap is a spring
loaded plastic pin!  What does this do.  I'll check it out later.  Me suspects
that you can close the flap up tight (for the winter)?
