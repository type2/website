Lincoln,=20
No. your problem is a new static suppressor wire which you need,it plugs
in between you current wire that is plugged into your air mass box,cost
should be about 100.00 at your local vw store you will def need it to
live and operate your van at that altitude, whats happpening is your
current wire is allowing your computer on board to get false radio
signals at that altitude,and the new static suppressor has a 5th diode =
in
it that grounds out the radio waves, your  van will operate as if it's
starving for fuel may even quit on you, ,to get you home ,till you can
get and add that new wire,when it happens ,just pull to the side of the
road and stop ,if you haven't already,shut the machine off for approx.30
minutes, then start it up and you  should get another hunderd miles
before reoccurrence,only takes a moment to install new wire yourself,
then when you reach your perm altitude wait a couple of days and your =
van
brain should adjust itsself to the additional wire,     Good luck,   =20

Gee whiz, Roy's suggestions sound so helpful, but do you think instead =
of waiting at the side of the road it would be ok if I just pushed the =
thing for half an hour?

&gt;Someone here said it was the altitude and to either advance the timing=20
