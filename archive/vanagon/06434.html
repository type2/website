Subject: Re: Front door speakers and window crank

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have been thinking about replacing the front door 4 inch speakers on my
&gt; '84 Vanagon.  I have had the door panels off and checked out the existing
&gt; speaker mounting apparatus which looks to me to be difficult to reuse with
&gt; a replacement speaker.  The current speakers mount flush with the door panel
&gt; and the window crank passes over the speaker grill by just enough to cause
&gt; problems.  When the door is closed there is plenty of space between the 
&gt; speaker grill and the dash to mount a speaker that protrudes a bit.  It's 
&gt; the window crank that makes things difficult.  I was thinking of replacing
&gt; the window crank with one that is just slightly shorter to eliminate this
&gt; problem.  The reduction in length would make it a bit harder to crank the
&gt; window up but I can't imagine it being that much of a difference.

	Hmm - I have an 84 also, but the top speaker (the one closest to 
	the window crank) hasn't been a problem.  I'm not sure what your
	arrangement is, but you could consider placing a 6&quot; towards the 
	bottom of the door:

			|   X1     |
			|      W   |   This is the right door.
			|          |   W  = Crank
			|          |   X1 = 4-5&quot;
			|    -------   X2 = 6-8&quot;
			| X2  |
			----|
	
	The above works pretty good - IMO...

	Also, and this is related to the post about 1000-2000 rpm 
	problems...

	I have a AT FI 84 and have a similar problem.  It only happens
	occasionally and seems to be related to cold temperatures--
	Atlanta hasn't been _that_ cold though...!
	
	It only happens when I'm at a stop and begin to accelerate - I 
	seem to loose power and it feels as though there is some type of
	clog in the fuel line or fuel filter. It slowly moves along until
	suddenly it &quot;catches&quot; and begins to accelerate ok (although even
	then it feels like it's not at full power).  I've spoken to my
	mechanic and he seems to think it may be the air box.  He noticed
	a small aberration with the metal piece inside the air box that
	moves from the bottom of the box to the top depending on
	acceleration - I have no clue what it's called I'm afraid :(.

	In addition, although on nice days (this whole day related 
	thing is uncanny) it idles and operates beautifully, when the 
	above problem begins to occur, the idling is rough and slighly
	under it's normal (1000) operating rpm.

	Any help on this would be greatly appreciated - He's sort of
	indicated that it may need a new air box (parts &gt; $350).  Kinda
	expensive for my financial situation right now...:(
