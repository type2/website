Subject: screwed by PartsPlace Inc. (Majorly)

hey now,

first: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

second: okay, i ordered an axle assembly from VW PartsPlace, INC. i was hoping
to get the parts so i could hit the road this weekend. hey, i got a shipment
from them yesterday...i was psyched....all the shit i've put up with doing the
cv's myself was gonna be over with...yeah.

third: hey this box is really heavy. then i see the cost: $263.86. oh shit.
they sent me TWO assemblies...($100 + $20 core fee, refundable) plus shipping
and some new bolts i ordered. i immediately see my checking account bouncing
round the bank (i used a visa check to order).

fourth: i say, okay i can correct that part of it. let's get the axle on the
bus. at least i'll be able to cruise outta town. ha.

fifth: i get all my brand new bolts and stuff and jack up the van and put my
ground cloth down, got my dirty clothes on, crawl under and eager get ready to
put in the long awaited axle assembly so i can be truckin' down the road. i
put one end on the transmission side...fine...then tried to put the other on
the wheel side. uh oh. no can do. i thought...oh sssshhhhittttt. reminded me
of the other side when the cv joints weren't put on correctly and would fit.
i crawled out and check the movement of the joints. both joints moved fine and
correctly. i thought, maybe just this on is wrong. so i grab the other axle
assembly and try that one. same deal. it's like it's 2-3 inches long and
there's NO way it's gonna fit. by now i'm pissed. really pissed.

sixth: i compare the axle assemblies to the old one i have. the cv joints are
bigger on the ones that came from parts place and the axle seems longer. i
wonder WHAT they send me...a vanagon axle assembly?

so the van is staying in the back yard again this weekend. am i doing
something wrong here.....i jacked the van up just enough so i could turn the
wheel when tightening the bolts. when i put the other side in a week ago, it
just slid in nice and easy as can be...

oh well...patience is needed with these things. instead of the volks i'll be
taking the old mazda 626. not what i wanted to do but i'm determined to have
a good time this weekend.

so...partsplace is gonna credit my bank account and hopefully get me the right
part. meanwhile i've got a bounced check, a vw in the yard still, and can't
get the part anywhere in raleigh. anyone in raleigh got a spare bus axle
assembly? he he why not ask? partsplace is gonna try and get it right this time
and send me another one plus they are paying for ALL shipping charges except
the original shipping to me. MAYBE they'll get it right and MAYBE i'll be on
they road next week sometime. MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE.

thank you for letting me vent.
