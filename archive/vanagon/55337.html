Subject: Heater Panel Removal Help 84 Westy

Can anyone tell me the secret to removing the large plastic heater vent panel
? It is the large (snap? on) one in the middle of the dash with the heater
vent openings. Bentley calls it a heater directional panel. It seems as if it
should pop off and I see no screws that hold it in place. I think this is the
panel Joel Walker has attached numerous cup holders to. Thanks.
