Subject: AZ Bus Club Jerome Jamboree '95 info

Jerome Jamboree is not directly a Jerry Garcia event per se but is darned
near the next best thing.
Jerome, AZ is a former mining Ghost town/ tourist spot located &quot;roughly&quot; in
the center of Arizona. Dress for warm weather but prepare for anything.
Families welcome, yet has been known to be a little &quot;spirited&quot; in past
years. (Martha/busgirl would have enjoyed the magnesium fire), car/van
contest, chili cookoff, slow drags, &quot;celebrity&quot; item auction, misc fun
prizes, overnight camping encouraged. Come for the day, come for the weekend!
