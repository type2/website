Hi all!
First off, thanks for all the replies (Tim, Joel &amp; Johnny)!  Much appreciated.
I will buy the bently manual asap and hopefully will have it available for
the clutch job.  
I would like to set the ignition timing - I have a timing light - but am
unsure of the specs (timing marks) - advice on this would be greatly
appreciated.

I bled the hydraulic systems today, used Castrol GTLMA (or something) which
I have used in my Alfa - I found it quite difficult to rid the system of air
bubbles and ended up going through 2 quarts of the stuff to bleed the brake
&amp; clutch systems!  Is this odd?
TIA,  cheers,
