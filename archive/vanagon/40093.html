Subject: Re: Gas Prices (Union, OR)

I run a Texaco Station in NE OR.  In the last three weeks, my prices
(unleaded) have increased from $1.299 to $1.419.  The wholesale cost
is the only reason for my increase.  My margin is the same now as it
always has been.  At one point last week, the wholesale cost was rising
$.005 per day.  Doesn't sound like much until you buy 16,000 gallons
at a time.  And, to remain competitive, there are some months that
I sell diesel at cost.
