Subject: Is Lobro a good make for CV joint?
Date: Tue, 7 Jan 1997 21:23:41 -0000

I can get a so called Lobro (umlaut over the first o) CV joint kit
(includes boot, grease, clips etc) for GB#41.12 (approx US$65).

Are Lobro any good for CV joints?

Also I have seen an advertorial in VW Motoring for CV boots from Bailcast
(Tel: 0044 1257 266060) called Sticky Boots. They are split and you wrap
them around the joint then super glue the seam. I have not checked if they
do a Van one, but the Golf one is GB#9.09. Do you think its worthwhile?
