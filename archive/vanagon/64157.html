Subject: Re: Driver-side rear-view mirrors

&gt; Does anyone have any ideas on how to keep the driver-side rear-view mirror
&gt; from closing up against the van body at freeway speeds?  The mirror is on an
&gt; '84 Vanagon Wolfsburg.  I have tried to fix it 3 times with no success.  So
&gt; far I've replaced the mirror, taken it apart and tightened the inside bolts,
&gt; and taken it apart again and used a metal file to try and &quot;rough up&quot; the
&gt; metal on the interior pivot ball.  Now I'm driving down the freeway holding
&gt; the mirror in place (talk about windy!!).  Any help will be greatly
&gt; appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; TIA

In my Vanagon, the PO used what looks to be JB Weld on
the inside nut that adjusts tension.  I don't have to  hold the
mirror in place, but you have to move your head, instead
of the mirror, to adjust your view.  Ron and Kurt both sell
new ones for a reasonable price.
