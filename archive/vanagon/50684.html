Subject: Re: Vanagon Rustworthiness

&gt; As I have posted a few questions for Vanagon owners, here's my latest: 
&gt; How well rustproofed/undercoated are Vanagons in the 87-91 vintage. I 
&gt; have heard there was something done to them at the factory, but have 
&gt; no confirmation nor user data. We are in the Texas Gulf Coast where 
&gt; corrosion abounds and this is important to us. Many of the older 
&gt; air-cooleds don't hold up too well down here due to rust/corrosion, but 
&gt; I heard the later VW's of all type have factory 
&gt; undercoating/rust-proofing and should fare better. Any feedback 
&gt; appreciated.

My 88 definitely has rustproofing, which is almost certainly factory, 
since it seals the underside of the van completely. Since mine has high 
miles, and spent much of its life on salt ridden roads, it seems to 
have fared quite well. The standard seam rust is there, although not 
too bad. There is a bit of rust where the frame rails meet the floor 
boards underneath, but very light. The bottom front edges of the 
frame cross members have had the undercoating worn off from rock 
chips and debris, but are solid. The main problem areas which can 
quickly become bad are the front door steps (under the rubber), the 
bottom edge of the hatch door, and around the tail light housings. 
(at least these are the worst areas on mine). Fairly simple to 
prevent/slow down the rust in these spots, but also easy to ignore, 
which the PO did in my case...
