&gt; I want to attest to you guys just how cool VW owners are. I am the 3rd
&gt;  owner of this van and the 2nd owners had it from 87 until last summer.
&gt;  When I bought it they tried to make sure I had all of the reciepts....

Later you say something like &quot;I'm sure you don't care...&quot;

I care.  Stories like this really help to support VW owners as a &quot;community&quot;.

Also, thanks for the answers about your van.
