&gt;2.  '87 Vanagon
&gt;    67k miles
&gt;    auto
&gt;    Weekender?  (pop top but no appliances cabinets etc.)
&gt;    Salvage Title
&gt;    $7995

vermont is a bit far, but this is my ideal van.  I was wondering tho, how 
much, if at all possible, is it to get a westfalia pop top put on a late 
80's vanagon?  anyone have a 1-800# at least?
