Subject: farmington, NC show 7/14--going?

I will be in Winstom Salem this summer, leaving tommorrow, for five 
weeks at the school of the arts, and will be hopefully going to the show.  I 
read about this in VW Trends, does anyone know anything about it, or if 
they are going?  If anyone is planning on it, please let me know.  Reply 
to NCBP90D_at_prodigy_dot_com.  I am having to sign off the list while Im at 
film school, but I can still recieve email to my Prodigy account.
		Thanks in advance...		Dallas
