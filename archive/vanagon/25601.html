Subject: Vanagon V-6

Thought I would throw this one out and let y'all take a few swings at it:

1980 Vanagon with Chevy V-6.  Clutch out.  $650.

I looked at this a few months back (when it was $1000).  Decent 
conversion using Kennedy adapter and flywheel, Chevy Citation motor and 
radiator and Diesel Vanagon grille.  Minor rust, nice interior.  Motor is 
rebuilt and balanced, runs very nicely.  Tranny? Dunno, no clutch.  A 
rebuilt clutch runs $100 (for parts).  Am I correct in assuming that the 
VW clutch is what's needed here?  I need to go look at it closer.  How's 
it sound so far?
