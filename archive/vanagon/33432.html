Subject: Re: Death by fire?carb leaks

&gt; &gt;&gt; If anyone can suggest how to stick this lil bleeder
&gt; &gt;&gt; eternally in position I'd be grateful...

The aluminum carb body can be &quot;gently&quot; staked next to the
brass inlet fitting. I've used a small centering punch and a
4 oz jewelers hammer to lightly &quot;mush&quot; a section of the carb
flange firmly against the offending inlet fitting while being
careful not to puncture the fitting itsself.
