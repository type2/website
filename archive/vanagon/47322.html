Subject: VW shows in PGH

     HI ALL,

       I went to the Pgh. Vintage grandprix saturday to see
       the german car show. After seeing alot of cool bugs
       and stuff I talked with some of the people who run the
       Three Rivers Volkswagen Club and The German Air Sucker
       Society (GASS). They Informed me that there are 2 Auto
       events that I shouldn't miss. The first is sunday evening
       AUG. 18th at Sandcastle. (the water park on the mon. river)
       They have a car cruse there every sunday evening. My guess 
       is that It is supported by a different club every week and 
       it must be VW's turn. The second is Sept.  29th at Billco 
       Motor a Volkswagen dealer, located on RT. 19 North of Pgh.

       This would be a good time to show your Bus/Vanagon and
       meet others from the list that are in the pgh. area.
       Come one come all. Don't be to concerned about your vehicles
       condition, just show up, who knows, you may find someone
       has a part you need. With any luck my Syncro will be at 
       both shows. Come and see the connecting rod thru the block
       engine display I have.
                                     
            Sandcastle Sunday night Aug.18th
                 That's all I know...
