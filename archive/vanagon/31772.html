Subject: List Stickers, shall I make them?

Howdy all,
Hope everyone had a pleasant Holiday vacation. Over mine, I did some
checking up on making up list stickers. My main concern is that I would
have to order 500 (yes, five hundred) stickers as a minimum, to get the
best price possible. So, basically, I just want to make sure I can sell
enough to cover myself. Though I won't describe the design (just a tad
paranoid), I do believe they will be pretty nifty. One of the big points
of these stickers, I think, is to place them in a standard spot, on the
rear left corner/window, to be able to instantly identify fellow
members. So, they will stand out, but NOT in a tacky fashion. They are
very tasteful, and simple, yet elegant, and with lotsa symbolism present
in the design. :)
  Bottom lines are these-
 Cost would be $5.00 for 3, $10.00 for 7, and generally $2.00 each. BUT,
I don't really want to sell singles, as $2.00 checks are kinda silly. 
Sending cash would probably be most convenient, but there can be many
problems with that, so that's kind of risky.
  Shipping would be easy, however, as I would probably ask everyone for
a self-addressed, STAMPED envelope. one stamp should be good for up to
10 stickers, and 2 stamps certainly for 10 more. 

So, then, should I take the plunge? If everyone out there got some, then
there would definately be plenty of demand. Please let me know, since if
I can do it without going to the poorhouse, I'd really like to. 

Richard
