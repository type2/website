Subject:      fwd: EV CV and awning question

&gt;message: Hi Folks: I'm a proud new owner of a '94 V.W. Eurovan
&gt;Wesfalia c.v.I have had the vehicle less than a week
&gt;and am please with the unit - so far so good.
&gt;

Congratulations! Those are pretty unusual vehicles around here - where are
you located?

&gt;I'm in the market for a awning to fit the vehicle and
&gt;am at a loss to know what is the best and most cost
&gt;effective awning for the '94 Eurovan.
&gt;I would prefer information on awnings made or sourced
&gt;in Canada or the northwest U.S.
&gt;Any reccomendations as to awning makes and models to
&gt;buy (or not to buy). What to look for in an awning,
&gt;prices, sources,hints and tips etc.
&gt;

Carefree of Colorado makes a variety of awnings - they are the OEM for
the VW/Winnebago awnings that are available for those models.
(That's one of their awnings on the Web page you found.)
It may be a little long for a regular-length wheelbase van, but they
perhaps make shorter ones.

I'm forwarding your question to the Vanagon mailing list where I'm hoping
that there are other folks that can provide more info.
