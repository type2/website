Many thanks to all those who responded to my multiple pleas for cis help on
my jetta.  The problem was a fried/missing/fouled up set of grounds that
fried the control unit.  Rewired, installed used control unit, reset fuel
mixture and voila!  runs like a champ!!  Anybody know how to unsieze an
idle mixture screw??

THanks Again!!!!!
