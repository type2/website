I don't know where the speedo pickup is on those new buses you people 
drive is.  But if it's in the front axel then the speedo would stay the 
same even if you got larger tires, just so long as the front is the same 
size as the rear.

	Dude?? Making more discoveries of hidden treasure??
	The speedo counts revolutions of the front tire. So many times
around * some circumferance = some distance. Change front tires size, 
on just the side where the pick-up is, and your speedo and odo dona 
worko so goodo!

	If you use a larger diameter tire/wheel, then it will
turn fewer times for a given speed and your speedo and odo will
read LOW. If you use a smaller diamenter tire/wheel, then it
will turn more times for a given speed and your speedo/odo will
read HIGH.

	So put on those chrome reverse rims with the 13&quot; AAA whitewalls
and lower your bus until it makes sparks going over manhole covers
and and it'll SEEM really 'smooth' at high speeds- because the speedo
will be reading higher than it should!

	Balance front/rear and left/right don't matter. Just the
diameter of the tire which has the speedo pickup.

	Cheers!
