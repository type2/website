&gt; battery is a good thing because it maintains the &quot;memory&quot; of the battery.  As 
&gt; I understand it, during the charge/discharge cycle of the battery an oxide 
&gt; develops on the plates, and without a complete discharge ocassionally the 
&gt; battery will not store as much of a charge as long.

Sounds reasonable to me!  I just wanted to make sure that people don't
group lead-acid batteries in the same group as NiCad's, which have a
very pronounced &quot;memory&quot; effect.  If I am not mistaken, it is only the
discharge cycle of a lead acid battery that causes buildup on the plates,
and the problem is that if you don't recharge the battery right away,
the deposits will harden and ruin the battery.  This is why it is important
to keep a lead-acid battery at full charge - to keep everything in solution.
'Course I have been wrong more than a few times...

&gt; Again I plead chemical imbalance, the alternator is a 200 amp, with two 
&gt; windings providing 100/100 per side.  $ 800.00

Ouch!  That alternator is worth more than my whole bus!  =)
