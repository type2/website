hi martha !
  no, the reason i didn't sign up for a potluck dish yet is not that i can't
cook (which is true...), it's just that i have two engines taken apart here,
sittin' on the workbench, and i just look at the pile of parts, the shell of
an engine and the big gaping holes in the back of my busses, and i have
serious doubts i'll ever get them back together again, not to mention by
the end of the month...
  i'll sign up for a dish a.s.a. it looks like i might  still make it down
there !
    ciao,
            Gregor \ 73 westy &quot;FESTUS&quot;
