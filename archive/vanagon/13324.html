Subject: to unlead or not,one more time

I'm going to try this posting one more time and then give up. 
Just briefly (got it Thom), I think I got a good as to whether my 82 camper 
will go unleaded after a lifetime of leaded. I called one of our local dealer
a very reputable VW/Audi concern and asked them. The reply was that I could run
unleaded without any problems, but every 5th tank should be leaded, that's a
+Pb/-Pb ration of 1/4. They have a lookup table which gives them the ratio
for evey age of vehicle. (The UK has only had unleaded for less than 10yrs I
think). He said  that it has something to do with the lead acting as a lubricant.
Can anyone shed any light on this. At least my fuel bill will go down slightly
and I will be do my bit for the environment, if I ignore the benzene and other 
stuff.
        One question, can any one tell me the cost of the Bentley manual for 
80-91 buses. I've seen it advertised here for about 60 English pounds, which         
is pretty hefty, the Haynes manual is less than 15.

Cheers
