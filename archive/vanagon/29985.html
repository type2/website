&gt;ok, i give up ... what the heck is a &quot;dart&quot; (as it relates to car bras.
&gt;or any bras for that matter)???

Whatsamatter?  Never did any sewing before?  Never been
inside a blouse?  No aspersions intended.  Dart is the term
for sewing flat material to cover curves.  You fold the
material, start sewing from the edge to form a triangle of
material between the fold and the seam.  The longer the
triangle, the gentler the curve.

I like my response more than Mr. Webster's.
