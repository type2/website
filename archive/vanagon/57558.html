Subject: FS: Steel Wheels &amp; Hub Caps

As I upgrade to Alloy Wheels and Michelin MXT reinforced 205/70 R14 tires
I have a set of 4 VW original steel wheels for sale. They come attached to
original Michelin reinforced 185/70 R14 tires and Hub caps.

Dealer list for the steel wheels (believe it or not!) is $121
And for the Hub Caps is $65

That's enough to kill you!

They are off of a '91 Vanagon Westfalia with 28K original 1 owner miles.

All serious offers considered.
