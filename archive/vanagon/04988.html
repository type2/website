Subject:      nicknames for generations: THE answer!!! :)

ok, ok. i got it!! :)

the first generation was called Bulli (which had something to do with a
german slang name for an ox or draught-horse (that's work-horse to you
Yanks).

the second generation was called Bus or Bread-loaf (cause it looked like
that dancing loaf of bread in the commercials) or Bay-Window (because of
the huge single piece windshield).

the third generation was called Vanagons (cause of a bunch of stupid
advertising twits) or Bricks (cause of the squared-off shaped resemblance
to said construction material).

so ... what distinguishes the fourth generation from the others? it PULLS!!!
so it's a Puller. or Pulley. or Pulli. :)
