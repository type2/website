Subject: Mice

&gt;I live in the middle of farm land, park my 84 GL in a
&gt;machine shed with a concrete floor.  Field mice are always a
&gt;problem in boxes (etc.) but last year they invaded my
&gt;Vanagon ventilation system.
    (snip)
&gt;The last thing I want to do is kill them and smell dead
&gt;mice.  I drive the Vanagon every day, apparently the warmth
&gt;attracts them.

Run a ferret through your ventilation system every couple of
weeks!  Rodents are terrified of even traces of ferret smell.

I bet Bill Killian doesn't have mice or rats in any of his VW's
(since he uses them for toting hordes of ferrets).

Let me know where you live--maybe I have a friend with a ferret
nearby.

Dennis
