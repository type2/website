Subject: RE: Looking at 86 GL

I have an 87 Syncro camper with 143K.  Heads never touched.  Only signs of 
leaks now are the heater cores.  Fighting with VW to get them to replace them 
since both my Vanagons have this problem.  My Syncro 7 passenger has only 97K 
miles on it.

&gt; We're looking at an 86 GL with 141k miles at a used car dealer's lot.
&gt; I'm going to go back Saturday to drive it and take it to my mechanic on
&gt; Monday. It was owned by the proverbial little old lady that goes to his
&gt; church and service records are unknown. My question is this, is it
&gt; possible that this has gone 141k miles with no head work being done?
&gt; &gt;From following the list, my feeling is that this would be very unlikely.
&gt; There were no obvious coolant leaks and overflow tank in back was full.
&gt; For $2200 it's looking like it might be a good deal.

Yes it is possible and yes if it looks good and sounds good it probbaly
is a good deal at $2200.
