Subject: '83 Westy for Parts in Ca.

Stumbled on this ad last night.  Spoke to the owner.  Seems like a 
very good deal, but it would cost too much to transport East.  
Somebody out West should take advantage of this, if it isn't gone 
already.

'83 Watercooled Westy, no motor, rear trailing arm and quarter 
panel removed, but deluxe Westy interior, trans, etc. still there.
Seller is asking $400 or offer. Phone is 818-845-9622.  Operator 
says this is in Burbank, Ca.  

Sounds like a great donor for a Vanagon-to-Westy conversion, or 
even just for spare parts if you have a Westy. I would have bought 
it for this reason myself if it had been closer. (I would still go 
in on it with someone out West, if they could ship me some of the 
parts.)

I didn't ask the guy too many questions, so you might want to get 
more details.  He said his van was hit, so he bought this one 
without the motor for $600, and took off the trailing arm and 
quarter panel to fix his, and is now selling it with everything 
else still intact.  It is still at the body shop that did the work 
for him, and they want it removed, so he might be negotiable.  
Again, I don't know him, take no responsibility, etc. etc.
