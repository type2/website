you can stretch the old stuff back to &quot;almost new&quot; by exposing the trim to hot 
water or steam.

btw my friend found very similar stuff at hardware store cept it was light 
greyas opposed to the correct white. prolly the easiest thing to do is to 
scavenge a couple of old busses in the wreckers for the pieces that you are 
missing. i am pretty sure that the trim you are looking for was used on 72 and 
73 busses.
