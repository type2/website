Todd,

It's an excellent thing to do - my fridge starting problems went away
completely, and I didn't even replace the check valve - just drilled the
end of the pump out (not as big a drill as the manual says - I was chicken,
since the recommended drill  seemed just about as big as the end tube), and
then  I put some silicone grease on the piston (and added the gasket on the
piston that is mentioned in Bentley).

Made a big difference.   The new check valve would probably be even better.

&gt;Is this a worthwhile thing to do while I have the fridge out of the van?
&gt;
&gt;Also, is there a clever way to check the 12v heater with the fridge out of
&gt;the van?
&gt;
