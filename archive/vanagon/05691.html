Subject: Empi/Okrasa stuff......what's it worth? 


My bro just got an engine from a 1952 bus, with okrasa heads/a bunch of
other that era racing(?) stuff. It runs great, no leaks,rips, ravels, or 
tears...the gauges all work. All original vw stuff on the engine, all
either okrasa or Empi....my question is: we're supposed to sell this stuff
for this guy (A wonderful 3rd party deal :() and we've never thought that
we'd ever come into contact with stuff of this quality before, so, the
infamous newby-to-vw-sounding question: what's it worth? So far, we've had
offers for: a complete tune-up, a junk carb, but we think that the value 
exceeds these offers. :) BTW, it's a tach, and oil pressure mounted in a 
frame that will fit perfectly into the far driver's side of any oval. I'm 
trying to do this list from memory, so please excuse any obvious errors I
have made, as I'm relatively new to vw's,(1 yr.).
Sorry for those who get both lists!
