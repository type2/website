&gt;
&gt;I just bought a 1991 Westy so my 86 Syncro Westy has got to go {per the
loved one}. It's perfect inside , and everything is working. Aux. battery,
A.C., C.D player, etc.. The exterior is very nice, though it has the seam
rust so common, only on the drivers side. New rubber, c.v.s, mainshaft and
other goodies, Thule bike rack installed on top. Brakes are recent, so is
the exhaust. I could go on though if your interested email me and we can
talk in depth.  It has 136,000 miles on it and I'm going to ask somewhere
around 12,000 dollars, or in that ballpark, .
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks    Kris Weber   napman_at_planet_dot_net
