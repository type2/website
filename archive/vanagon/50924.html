&gt;&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;         I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
&gt;&gt; cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
&gt;&gt;         When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew that
&gt;&gt; this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
&gt;&gt; agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
&gt;&gt; heater core.
&gt;&gt;         Wow.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;         Rob
&gt;

Hi Larry,
        Thanks for the offer but even that's a little more than I want to
spend for a heater. 
Rob
