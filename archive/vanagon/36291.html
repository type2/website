Interesting suggestion.  I just called the dealer to check on progress (and
to make sure they had actually STARTED on the car, which isn't always a
valid assumption for one to make, JUST because you filled out the paperwork
and left the car and key!).

Wouldn't start for them either.  No spark and no fuel pressure and they
don't yet know why.  Damn, if this turns out to be in the ecu, I'm probably
hosed to the tune of lots of money, since that's not covered by the
warranty beyond 24K miles (has about 33K now).  I'm gonna be bummed.

On the other hand, the major problem I had last year was due to a battery
having sat in the car on the lot for up to two years (manufacture date was
2yrs and 1month before I bought it).  I imagine that battery connections
could have a big effect on computer voltage, which would make or break
whether it ran or not.  Like the FI in the ol' squarebacks we had.  If the
battery wasn't up to snuff, all the juice went into cranking, and not
enough to squirting fuel and firing plugs, and it wouldn't run.  Hope
THAT's it.
