&gt; Hi,
&gt;         I *desperately* need some help finding a mechanic for a friend of
&gt; mine near Saint Louis.  I loaned out our '82 vanagon and it has developed
&gt; an oil leak and is having trouble finding first gear.  I am not from that
&gt; area, and I have no access to any yellow pages for the Saint Louis area.
&gt; Could anyone from that area please, please, please send me a quick note
&gt; with names and numbers of trusted mechanics?!?  I promise to drop your name
&gt; in hopes that you will might get a break on your next job with them : ^ )
&gt; Any responses welcomed, the more for any particular garage the better!
&gt; TIA,
&gt; Dave.
