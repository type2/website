Subject: an Alternative Aux. Battery Config.

Okay,
this keeps popping up over the years and the archives are full of
discussions...  One hair-brained Idea I recently had, I belive
has not been mentioned, so I thought I'd bring it up, see what people
on this list think about it..

It stems from realizing that what we want is engine cranking power
after long weekends of camping, and using the battery power for
camping stuff during the stay.

How about using _two_ 6V (marine?) batteries in _series_?

This would solve the problem of switching between batteries,
uneven charging, and all the related complexity of running two
batteries in parallel.  We could actually come up with (I know these
exist) solutions like an out-cutoff switch to the auxiliary circuitry
when the overall battery voltage drops below, say, 10V, which should still
leave enough cranking power for the morning getaway...   :-)

Any comments?  opinions?
