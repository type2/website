&gt; Some of the VW AC systems make a sunroof anywhere on the roof
&gt; impossible,
&gt; I know. Fred, is yours the upfront kind or the backtofront kind?
&gt; B.

Actually, the long AC duct running down the middle of the ceiling is
quite easy to remove and the AC is still very functional just blowing
out the hole in the rear housing that's left over.

I'd *gladly* yank my AC duct for a sunroof - is it really possible to
retrofit them???
