Subject: Trip suggestions


I have an opportunity coming up to travel for three months after 
graduation.  I was planning on traveling from California (current 
location) to Florida across the bottom of the U.S.  From there, I would 
head north/northwest to Michigan.  Then west to washington, and finally 
south back down to California, and home.

I will be traveling in a 1979 Westfalia.  I will be leaving at the end of 
August and returning by Christmas.

Now for my questions:

1.  Any areas I should definately hit along the way?

2.  Suggestions for inexpensive camping?

3.  Areas I should avoid/ not bother seeing?

4.  Any ideas as to how much a trip like this will cost- assuming my well 
maintained ride doesn't totally crap out?


Any suggestions, questions, or comments are welcomed and appreciated.


Thanks,

Matt Lamar
