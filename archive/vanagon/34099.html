Subject: RE: (1962) US brake parts dealers


Sent to vanagon_at_lenti, with copy to Gerald Skerbitz:

&gt;Can anyone send me phone numbers of VW parts dealers in the US that might 
be
&gt;able to ship the 1962 brake shoes &amp; cylinders over to the UK?
&gt;Even with phone-call &amp; shipping costs it sounds like it might be cheaper 
than
&gt;buying US imports from the (only) UK dealer that does them.
&gt;Shipping could be a killer (+import duty?tax?). Worth asking tho...


Recently I saw a 1970 bus that the PO had bought new in Germany,
toured around in, and then had it shipped over here to the US.

After it got here, in subsequent years it needed some brake work. The
PO told me that he discovered at that point, that the drums and shoes
were different from normal US models in 1970, and he had to get
shoes and a drum from Germany!

Check the part numbers carefully, between your bus and the US models that
US dealers have parts for. They might not match!
