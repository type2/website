Subject: Bumper

I was driving through San Rafael, CA Saturday evening and saw a blue Vanagon
with a purple rear bumper. It (the bumper) looked like it was custom made
welded steel. It followed the lines of the stock bumper but looked like a
barden style bumper without the diamond plate. If this is your Vanagon or you
are familiar with it please contact me. I would like to find an alternative
to the stock flimsy one I have now.

Thanks
