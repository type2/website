Martha, all,
	If we make it off of this South Pacific paradise as planned and 
return to home this year we'd love to join you all for a CCC camp out.  
For a german cuisine meal I would try to brew the best coffee possible.  
Germans do that very well.  At least, I'd try to get german coffee and 
brew it using Bob Hoover's grandmother's recipe plus eggs shells!
