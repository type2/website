&gt; Anyone want to theorize all the bad things that could happen if
&gt; you add TOO MUCH oil to your vanagon/bus?
&gt; 
&gt; /martha
&gt; 

	Of course it depends on *how* much, like if you add 5000 gallons
	there be a whole shitload of theories I could come up with. But, you
	probably mean like a quart or three too much, don'tja?;}

	Theory #1:
	I'll have to drag out all that crap to drain some out and then get all
	messy trying to put the plug back in while oil is dropping out and 
	that's when I'll witness another level of degradation of motor-control
	with my digits while enjoying the aging process as I won't be able to 
	start the threads. I'll give up trying to save &lt;$10 worth of oil and
	blurt out f()*^$! and drop the plug in the drain pan, strain to reach
	the paper towels, get up and amble inside, wash my mits, grab a Full
	Sail and plop on the back porch and wonder why I'm not paying one of
	them skilled technicians to do this.

	Theory #2:
	With too much oil, the crank and rods will splash so much oil around
	the case that oil will get sucked in some pipe and foul the catalytic,
	or carbon canister.

	Theory #3:
	With too much oil, the crank and rods will splash so much oil around
	the case that oil will be driven through the front seal.

	Theory #4:
	With a massive amount of oil, the starter will not be able to rotate 
	the engine.
