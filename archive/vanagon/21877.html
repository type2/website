Doesn't one of the coolant pipes to/from the rad run right up against the 
floorwell? I think that VW has/had some sort of fix for hot feet... more 
pressboard and insulation?
Take out the spare and lay down on your back, head resting comfortably on 
the sloping spare cover, and look up to see whats what.
Maybe you can insert some heat shielding.
