Subject: Re: Bentley Manual WCM (Question)

&gt;WCM lists the Bentley manual for 68-79's for $34.95
&gt;
&gt;I thought the price of these was in the $70-$90 range?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone order one of these?  What's the difference between these and the more
&gt;expensive ones?

        Not the same ones. The $70-90 one is for vanagons, '80 and above.
The '68-79 can usually be found for around $29 or so, if you shop around.

Peace,
