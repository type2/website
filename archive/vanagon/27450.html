Once again, Joel Walker comes through with the winning solution:
Vanagon rear hatch shocks at $29/each + tax, UPS, etc. from

Marin Motor Sports
63 Industrial Way
GreenBrae, CA 94904
(415) 927-7090
(No URL yet, but claimed they're working on it)

They were in stock, and will arrive tomorrow, and I'll have them
installed for our ca_dot_campout this weekend.  Whoopee! Thanks to everyone
who gave me such timely feedback on this.
