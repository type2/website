&gt;&gt; I'd recommend Bosch W7DTC 3-prong plugs; I've had good luck with them in
&gt;&gt; our '87 2.1l Vanagon, a '77 Rabbit, and a '92 8v GTI.
&gt;
&gt;Are these the same as Bosch Platinum?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Hi Karl - no, they're not platinum, they just have 3 ground prongs instead
of one, &amp; more importantly the spark jumps a gap that is horizontal instead
of vertical; ie, the spark is 'unshrouded'.  They used to be called surface
gap plugs, &amp; are similar to aircraft engine plugs.  (&amp; I hope that Bob
Hoover still is monitoring this list &amp; will correct me as necessary).
