&gt;Message-ID: &lt;199703141938.OAA14235_at_wilde.oit.umass_dot_edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Tom suggested that I request the following:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Can you call and have someone look at the sticker for you? 
&gt;. . . ask anyone on the list with the same Westie to go out
&gt;and look at theirs for you.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;So - Please help us with this. If you owne an '88-'91 Westfalia Camper -
&gt;look at the tire specs sticker in your door jam (glove box?) and see what
&gt;the details are on the tires - 
&gt;
&gt;Does it specify a 97 weight class or something else, what tire pressure does
&gt;it specify. You info will put this issue to rest for some of us.
&gt;
&gt;Thankx -
&gt;	Kenyon

This is what my tire sticker says...


				BAR	PSI	kPa

185 R14 C 6 PR		Front	3,0	43	300
			Rear	3,7	53	370
205/70R14 97R	   	Front	2,1	30	210	
Reinforced		Rear	2,8	40	280

I have Michelins 185 R14 94 R (I believe these are reinforced and replace the ones 
above.  The tire pressure on the tire is 40...that's is what I inflate to.
