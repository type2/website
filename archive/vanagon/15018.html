I feel for you, Dude.  All that work and money.

I'm sitting here in Las Cruces with my bus in the shop with the
flywheel spun off again.  No floor jack and no place to work on it so
I had to bite the bullet and take it in.  It's gonna be a new crank
and flywheel, at least, plus all those labor $ ... ouch!  Not tightening
the gland nut properly the first time has just cost me $1k plus many hours
of labor ... let that be a lesson for the new mechanics on here.  
Fortunately I got to my destination before it failed.

Let us know what you find on teardown.
