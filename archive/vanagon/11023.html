Subject: [A] 73 1700 push rod tube question ...

Hey all. I am in the process of putting our 73 Westy's engine back together,
and am having some trouble with the pushrod tubes. The engine in the 1700
type IV.
After replacing the seals on both ends of the tubes, I passed them through
the rocker box, and into the holes in the engine block. The problem is, 
even with the head torqued down properly, they are not really tight into the
engine. I can pop them out without too much effort. I'm wondering what
actually holds them in ... the long bent wire that goes in with the rocker
arms seems to press up against them inside the rocker box, but is this it?
It also seems that you could remove these tubes with the engine in the bus
by just removing the rocker arms, and pulling the tubes out, is this true?
Any ideas would be much appreciated. I'm just worried that the tubes are
going to pop out of place with the engine running (or leak!).

-Dan
