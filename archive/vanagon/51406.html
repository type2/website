Subject: Diesel questions/engine swaps etc.
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Hope someone can answer these questions:

1. What year(s) did the turbo diesel jettaand/or rabbit  sell in the US?
What 	displacement?
2. Has any one installed one of these in a diesel vanagon?
3 .What are the final drive ratios for the diesel and waterboxer
transmission?
4. Will a diesel bellhousing fit on a waterboxer trans?
5. What is the ideal trans for a gas engine swap into a diesel vanagon
(just curious-I 	would prefer a turbo diesel conversion-maybe a
TDI aahhh).
6. I've heard the Audi 5000 5sp trans is very similar to the vanagon
trans. Is this a 	suitable tranny donor? I bought a complete 5000
wagon w/ a 5sp for $800 	last year but just sold it a couple of
months ago. 
7. What about an Audi 5000 Turbo swap?

BTW I used to build BMW racecars so fabrication and mechanical work are
not problems.
