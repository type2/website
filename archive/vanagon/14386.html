Subject: Newly purchased 71 bus

Hi, all--

I am the proud owner of a 1971 Transporter, just purchased. It has
some good points and some flaws, as any used car will. Can anybody
give me advice on any of these?

1.) This bus has some rusted-thru areas just below the windshield. 
I've seen this on many 68-71 buses-- it seems to be a common problem.
Normally, body shops fix this by cutting out the rusted metal, and
either welding in new metal, or fiberglassing. But this section helps
mount the windshield. Can these things still be done? Anyone have any
experience in this area? Any other suggestions for fixing this?

2.) The big sliding door on the side, runs on two (three?) bearings.
These are very stiff and difficult on this bus, and probably haven't
been lubed in years. How do I lube these, and with what? Also, if they
need to be replaced, where can I get (new) parts? Any special techniques
for removal/replacement/adjustment?

3.) I'd like to get a little more oomph from the engine, but without
cutting the case for larger pistons &amp; cylinders. I once had a bug with
1600 DP, Weber 2V carb, 009 distributor, and dual quiet-pack. It had a
nicer top end than stock. Anyone know what the power of such and engine
would be, as opposed to the 65 HP of a stock DP engine? How about a
1600 DP engine with dual baby Kadron carbs, and the 009 and quiet-pack
exhaust? Any other suggestions for ways of increasing horsepower from
a 1600 DP engine? I'd also like to keep the engine pretty drivable, with
a decent idle (no overlapping valves) etc. Anyone know how these various
parts will affect gas mileage, given &quot;normal&quot; street driving (whatever
that is!)

4.) I've heard of ported heads such as the 041 head, the 045 head, and
others. What exactly do these heads do for you? Which would be better
for street driving, and with which accessories (carbs, distributor, etc.)
as I've described above?

5.) I've also heard of a &quot;modified 009&quot; distributor, and an &quot;050&quot; 
distributor. How do these differ from the basic 009 centrifugal-advance
distributor?

6.) Any suggestions on quiet-pack type extractor/mufflers? How do different
brands compare for free flow, quietness, longevity, etc.? Anyone have any
favorites they would like to recommend, or any horror stories they'd like
to caution a born-again fellow V-dub aficianado about?

7.) Has anyone ever mounted a Type-4 engine (1800cc or bigger) in a 68-71
bus? These years have the rear engine mount, which requires either the
&quot;busmount&quot; engine case, or an aftermarket adapter plate that goes over
the oil pump, for type-1 style (upright fan) engines. Any suggestions or
tales of experience, either good or bad?

Thanks in advance for any info. Transporters forever!
