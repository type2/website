  I only saw one reply posted which suggested getting some gas shocks
  for the rear.  The reply _suggests_ the answer to 1) is &quot;Yes&quot; and the
  answer to 2) is &quot;No&quot; (or &quot;it's too hard&quot;).
 
  Since I'm having the same rear tire wear problem I thought I post the
  questions once again.

I would have the rear camber and toe adjusted as needed.  Springs alone will
not cause the excessive wear.
