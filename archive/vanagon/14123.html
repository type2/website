Subject: reduction gears

Jon Christensen responded to my transaxle woos - suggesting my reduction
gears might be suspect.  I've no experience with them as my previous was
a 74 westy interior kombi camper.  My split is new to me (since Dec.).
What kind of job is it to R&amp;R the reduction gear? (I didn't bring my manuals
to werk.)  Does it make sense that the noise would cease when I press in
the clutch?  BTW, the transaxle has a slow leak but the fluid level checked
out ok.  Also, the noise seemed to be loudest near the rear pass. side.  
Thanks Jon, I'll look into the RGs first
