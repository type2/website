Subject: Re: 1972 (en... morphing to rear apron disscussion :-).

&gt;&gt;engine and engine compartment, I don't see how anyone can install the
&gt;&gt;engine with the fan housing on, much less the tin.  Like you say, you
&gt;&gt;have to move the engine back to clear the input shaft, and things hit
&gt;&gt;the rear of the engine compartment.  Why oh why couldn't they have made
&gt;&gt;it removable like the earlier busses?!?!?  :)
&gt;
&gt;Always learning, always learning.....
&gt;It is possible to put the type 4 engine in the '73 with the fan housing on.  
&gt;I have always done it that way (but probably won't anymore).  It is a tight 
&gt;fit, and you have to have the engine/trans bolts all set up right, but it 
&gt;goes.  It always scares me when I do this, since that trans shaft looks so 
&gt;fragile....
&gt;
&gt;I think we can thank the gov't for the change to the non-removable rear 
&gt;apron.  '73 was 'the year of the bumper', and I think in order to meet the 
&gt;crash tests they had to reinforce this area.  Anybody know for sure?

The way I see the removable apron:  

1) 71's have a removable apron, as well as the 1600 and the down low front 
turn signals.

2) 72's have the T4 engine, with the down low front turn signals, but the 
one which I see often does  _not_ have a removable apron.  The 72 also has 
the bigger air scoops and the different rear end (body wise).

3) in 73 the turn signals moved up in the front and got more square in 
shape.  I think that the rear has the previously mentioned bumper.

I guess that what I am getting at is that the fixed rear apron is a 
consquence of the T4 engine, not the bumper.

While we are here, how do you distinguish between the model years 68 to 71?  
The 71 has different hubcaps, but I don't know if these could be retrofitted 
to the earlier years.  other than that, I can't tell a 68 from a 69 from a 70.
