Wow.  Lots of response this time.  I guess my mail is finally getting
out ;-)

I'll be trying out the various suggestions this weekend, and assuming
nothing blows up, I'll report back on Monday.

I also found my BN4 service manual, which should help a lot.  If only
it weren't a fifth generation reproduction....
