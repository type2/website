&gt; &gt; HaHa, so you pee'd out of the vent windows yet? The only solution to your 
&gt; &gt; problem that I've found is to go out the front door, just pull in on the 
&gt; &gt; door handle as you open the latch. Less of a telltale 'pop' that way. tim s.

Them westcoasters with their prunes...  I don't think they're just peein'.

&gt; 
&gt; Or.... You can get a porta-potti.

In a vanagon, you can pee in (well males anyway) an empty beer bottle,
pop up the engine lid and pour it out under the back end.
Be careful not to short out your alternator. :)
