Subject: Re: Air conditioning...in a 78 Westy? huh?


&gt;anybody know if 75 or earlier could get a/c?  i don't recall 1971 
having that
&gt;as an option, but my 1974 porsche 914 had a dealer installed 
vw-approved
&gt;a/c unit.

FWIW my son's 73 Westy had A/C but it was purchased used so don't know 
if it was dealer add-on or an after market unit.  I have a unit to
install in a split window but it hasn't been installed yet.  It is
definitely an after market unit.
