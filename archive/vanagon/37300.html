Subject: wheel bearings

It doesn't stop.  Three weeks ago, new heads and then the new 
muffler and now a roar that I'm told is a wheel bearing. Now the 
question: 86 synchro, how is the best way to find out which wheel 
has the bad bearing? Can't seem to locate where the noise is coming 
from.  Sherwin
