Subject: More self-destructs defeated

After bringing home my '75 bus I immediately changed the oil and
adjusted the valves.  Then queried the list for other items that need
attention to make sure the bus would not self-destruct.  I received
many good suggestions and already posted my experience repacking the
rear wheel bearings and CV joints.

Since then I repacked the front wheel bearings, rebuilt the calipers,
replaced all 4 brake hoses, and put in new brake pads.
The cost was:
Grease         2.91
Whl brg seals  5.10
Caliper Kits  37.50
Brake pads    14.75
Brake hoses   48.75
Brake fluid    6.25
The whole job was pretty straight forward after I got all the right
parts.  One of the brake pads had a crack in the lining that looked
like it would flake off at the first hard stop.  Also I was given
4 identical brake hoses.  They were the correct part for the front
but about 3in longer than the ones in back.  Furthermore the LR hose
has one male and one female fitting, not both female like all the rest.
It took about 2hrs at the FLAPS until they found what I needed in
their warehouse.  Looks like all the cross references had it wrong.

The shock absorbers were in real bad shape so I removed them.  Man
does this thing handle like a boat :)  It also has a bad vibration at
60mph.  After a few days of driving the bad vibration now occurs at
55mph.  I am thinking the tires need balancing but upon further
inspection I see that the front tires are broken.  They are not round
anymore.  Each had a large bulge.  Looks like time to buy new tires.
The cheapest ones I could find were Michelin 185R14 Rein.  I also
bought new shocks: KYB gas-a-just all around.
Cost:
Tires, mounted, balanced, road hazard 366.44
Shocks                                136.08
Man what a difference.  It drives like a different vehicle than the
one I bought.  Unfortunately one of the hubcaps fell off by the time
I got home.  Discount Tire was very good about it and had a
replacement shipped from a CA location which arrived about a week
later.  Its all shiny compared to the dull, slightly rusted ones 
that are on the bus to start with.  The rear shocks may be a problem.
When I jack up the rear the suspension hangs on the shocks instead of
the stops.  Does anyone else have this feature?

The final procedure was to replace all the fuel lines.  All the posts
concerning gasoline showers really paid off.  While removing the
lines from the tank I positioned myself so as not to get doused by
the inevitable downpour.  I did pretty good lying on my back pulling
off the hoses and slipping on plugs to stop the flow.  Still it ran
all down my arm and shoulder.  Had to take a shower right away since
the gas started really stinging my skin.  When installing the new
hose I got a little smarter and removed the RR wheel.  This time gas
only ran down my arms to the elbow as I reached around the suspension
through the wheel well.  I replaced all the lines as well as the vent
connections and tee and injector seals.
Cost:
2ft 12mm hose         6.78
15ft 7mm hose        29.85
Filter                6.45
Large injector seals  6.36
Small injector seals  5.16
2 hose clamps         1.10
Vent hose tee         1.39
The vent tee was not the female tee the factory used but a 5/16&quot; tee
with short pieces of hose.  Also the Bently manual said the tank cover
could just barely be removed with the engine in.  That was exactly
right.  Pulling it out was difficult but putting it back in looked
impossible at first.  Then I maneuvered it so I could get the bottom
in first and push the lower lip down between the rear tin and body.
Then push the top in and lift into place.  Works just fine once the
puzzle is solved.  No bent tin either.

Are any of you interested in seeing the prices I am paying for parts?
I've already spent over US$1K to fix things I felt were very urgent.
This is about $500 more than expected this early in my ownership.

I have appreciated the posts others have made on their repairs so I
trust others are enjoying mine.
