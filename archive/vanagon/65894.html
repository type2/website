Subject:      Re: interior rear heat

The aircooled has rear heater outlets. Notice the small step
when entering the front driver's area from rear. There is an
outlet for hot air, I mean, really hot air. It is so hot that it melted
the plastic wheels of our baby buggy.

But for all those, who do not have this outlet, there is a ductwork
for the crewcabs which fits nicely between the two front seats
and guides fresh or hot air from the front feet outlet to the rear.
