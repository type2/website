Subject: Dying in the rain

hi-  

i had the same problem a few months ago.  mine turned out to be the oxygen
sensor getting wet.  a little electrical tape on the connection on the
exhaust and never happened again.

i got a ton of response, you should look in the archives under &quot;runs rough
in rain&quot;

good luck...
