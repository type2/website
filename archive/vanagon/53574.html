I've heard discussion of parting out vans on the Listserv as of late.

Does anyone have a 185 - 75 - R14 rim for sale?  I'm preparing for a trip up 
the Alcan in April.

************P.S.   Over the past 3 days I've only received 12 postings (and 
none yesterday) is the list particularly slow or am I not receiving mail?
