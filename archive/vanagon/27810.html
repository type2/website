&gt;&gt; More information about the splash pan phenomena is needed and welcome.

&gt;I guess I've thought of these as 'belly' pans.  Often they were
&gt;discarded.  They're good to have as they help protect the master cylinder
&gt;and cables etc. from exposure to the weather.  It also helps keep
&gt;excessive drafts from finding their way into the cab.  It also helps to
&gt;have the little square rubber biscuits for the clutch &amp; brake pedal and
&gt;also the booty for the accelerator rod to keep out the drafts.  8-)

Jon and David,

VW Parts List identifies them as:

211.703.609  Cover plate under pedal linkage (LHD)
211.703.609A Cover plate under pedal linkage (RHD)

both from chassis no. 20-117902 (1952)

I assume those part numbers held until the dual circuit
master cylinder went on in 1967.  My 67s with the dual
cylinder have a small part cut out for the cylinder to peek
through a bit.

I am no expert.  It helps to have *the book*. :)

I agree on the booty recommendation for the accelerator
linkage, but those little black biscuits do not seem to be
listed anywhere.  I know they are just black foam squares,
but where do they come from?  Anyone found an acceptable
substitute?
