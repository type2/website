Regarding the oil changes:

If you end up enjoying doing it yourself, good for you.  Otherwise, try
the dealers.  The one near me charges 19.95 and will take my van
whenever I drive in normally, no appointment necessary, and does the job
rather speedily.  At 19.95 (including the filter), it's cheaper than the
Jiffy Lubes and Speedy's, and they actually know what they're doing. 
They send me a little postcard every 3 months to remind me it's time
again with a few 'specials' printed on it which are usually good deals
if I need the work done.  Sometimes it's just a flat percentage off
anything I need.  Now the dealer is usually way to expensive for most
things, but mine here is pretty good.  If you can find yourself a good
one ...  Mine has even done things for free (without me having to argue,
no less!)  And parts can actually be cheaper and more timely obtained
(not all parts, but some).  The air intake boot was the same price at
the dealer as anywhere else, and the dealer would overnight it for me. 
They ended up installing it for free because it was taking them too long
(took them 5 hours and I was waiting in the showroom for them to get
done!).  I didn't even ask for anything or complain about the long wait.

I guess there's been so much bad rap given to the dealers that I had to
say something positive about them!  Seriously, if you don't want to fool
with the oil, give them a shot.
