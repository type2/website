&gt; Description:  85 1.9 litre waterboxer.  Fuel injection, automatic tranny.

&gt; The Problem:  I can start the van just fine and drive it anywhere.  If I turn
&gt; the engine off, I will not be able to restart the engine for 30-45 minutes.
&gt;  The engine will turn over but will not catch.  I get a good spark to all
&gt; plugs.  When the engine is running I get black, wet soot from the tail pipe
&gt; that smells like gasoline.  When I turn the engine off, I can smell the
&gt; engine compartment reaking of fuel.

                     YIKES!  DUCK!

Job #1: make sure you don't have a leaking fuel line/injector/etc. 
anywhere.  If you do, you're driving a mobile bomb/Molotov Cocktail.  
Eliminate fuel leaks before you drive it an inch more.  Please.  (Leaking 
fuel freaks me out--can you tell?)

Sound like it's running way too rich.  (Am I an Einstein or what?  ;-) )
Maybe your cold-start injector is stuck on?  Don't vanagons have a 
termo-switch of some kind to shut off the cold-start injector once the 
engine is warmed up enough?  If this is stuck, this'd give you that rich 
fuel mixture.  

Just my CDN$0.02.
