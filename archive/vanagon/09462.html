&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm pretty much stranded in Phoenix due to this little
&gt; problem.  The current situation is that when I cruise down
&gt; the highway all is fine, but when I put a bit of a load on
&gt; the motor it begins to crap out.  I have to ease back on
&gt; the peddle to keep the engine running.  Generally at the
&gt; top of a hill i'm doing between 25-35.  This I can almost
&gt; deal with.  The problem arises when I exit the highway.
&gt; When I get to the stop, the engine dies.  If I wait from
&gt; 10 minutes to 2 hours I can start it again.  This is not
&gt; good.  I can crank all I like but  it doesn't help.
&gt; 
&gt; 
Check out the engine/tranny/chassis ground system - best thing is to 
remove them, scrape the area around the ground screw and under the ground 
screw head and re-tighten them.  There are several of these (I don't 
remember how many) that electrically tie the whole thing together and 
provide a steady ground connection to the FI system.  When they become 
loose or corroded the additional electrical resistance causes a 
fluctuation in the ground potential at the FI computer, which can appear 
as a signal, causing the FI computer to 'miscalculate' and improperly 
adjust the mixture.  Also, you might want to check the O2 sensor 
connections and/or the O2 sensor itself.  Both of these problems have 
caused similar conditions for me in the past.
