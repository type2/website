(Tony's story (long) made me think of this ... so it's NOT my fault!!) :)


Jingle Bells

Crashing through the snow,
In a Westy Camper bus,
Over the fields we go,
Raising quite a fuss!

We're looking for a tree,
To take with us back home.
We hope we find one that is free
As through the woods we roam!

&lt;chorus&gt;
  Oh, Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
  Making lots of fuss
  Oh, what fun it is to drive
  In an old Volkswagen bus!

A day or two ago,
The wife said, &quot;Get a tree!&quot;,
And soon we're riding round,
The bus, the dog, and me.

I took the old back roads,
To see what I could see,
And hoped that I would find out there
The perfect Christmas tree.

&lt;chorus&gt;

We passed a lot of folks,
The snow had made them cowed,
Cause they stayed on the roads
That were already plowed.

The snow was white and deep,
But the bus has lots of pluck!
And though we slipped and slid around
We never once got stuck!

&lt;chorus&gt;
