Subject: re: Vanagon dash bulbs

I haven't removed one yet, but they look the same as those for my 
Jetta. If so, the local FLAPS (BowWow) carries them for about $2-3 
each *with* the holders...

Mine came in a small package - I can check for a mfr or part # if you 
want.

No, no.  not those things you stick in your blummenvasen.  Light
bulbs.  Anyone found a non-dealer, non-junkyard replacement for the
instrument the vanagons?

i had bought a pack of small bulbs that were the same dimension as the
ones in the black plastic holders.  spent about 45 minutes fiddling
with getting the old bulb out, soldering in a new one, and reforming
all the melted plastic from the 'repair'.  ecch.  need an easier way.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
