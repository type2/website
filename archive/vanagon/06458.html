&gt; &gt; One quick thought regarding the long awaited summer van trip...
&gt; &gt; from my understanding this is going to be a circle tour of the
&gt; &gt; US where people will be joining the tour at various points, and
&gt; &gt; leaving the tour at various points...right?
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that there will be no point in time where we will
&gt; &gt; all be together in one place, correct? 
&gt; 
&gt; That was the original plan...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; IMHO, wouldn't it be better if we could all be at one place
&gt; &gt; at one time rather than be a bunch of intermediate transients?
&gt; &gt; Could the plans for the trip be modified a bit where everybody
&gt; &gt; could converge at one central point in the US for a couple of
&gt; &gt; days, and then the east-coasters could continue west....the 
&gt; &gt; westcoasters continue east...etc...etc?
&gt; 
&gt; Well I put forth the suggestion of having two separate loops instead of
&gt; one since I don't know of anyone that is planning on making the whole
&gt; circle.  I got a few replies in favor of the idea, and none against it
&gt; (I don't think) so the current plan is to have two loops, one Western
&gt; and one Eastern, with a meeting point in perhaps St. Louis or Kansas
&gt; City where we could all converge for a couple of days.  Originally there
&gt; was some mention of perhaps going to a Royals game, but who knows what
&gt; will happen now...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone that would like a copy of the current trip route please let me
&gt; know and I will forward it to you.  Also, I am still looking for help
&gt; planning the Eastern loop, since I don't know much about the East coast.
	
	WOW! - My brother and I are planning this very thing (around US--
	both East and West).  Count me in!!  

	This list is crazy! :&gt;

P.S. Thanks for the help on engine bogging problems! I intend to check
     electrical connections tomorrow...
