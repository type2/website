Hey now

As a Dr. Seuss fan, I think I can guess what a Flit Gun is - it's
a hand-pumping spray gun for Flit, an insect repellent/killer.

Dr. Seuss used to draw the ads for Flit - usually another character
saying &quot;Quick, Henry, the Flit!&quot; as some huge insect was going about
it's business in a way that only Dr. Seuss could bring to light.

ObVW content - I just use the mosquito netting across the back hatch
of the Westy... :-)

&gt; Uhhh  -  not sure how many folk know what a flit gun is anymore - I only
&gt; barely remember one from when I was a kid, and I ain't admittin' how long ago
&gt; that was!     :-)
