Subject: Re: Canvas Cot Conundrum...

&gt;This answer is not 100% correct.  The cot design changed in 1976 so that
&gt;the poles are collapsable (each pole made of two rods, one of which fits

OOOps, I stand corrected, I haven't seen the collapsable poles at all! I 
HAVE fitted the '70 or so cot into a '78. I simply mounted the brackets so 
that the cot rails fitted, not likely at &quot;stock '78&quot; elevation. There are 
wires in the windshield posts, so drill carefully if you move yours (up?).
