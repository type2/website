Subject: Looking for a jack &quot;Jackall Series 8000&quot;

Hi all, 

Looking for a jack for Syncros and others 4WD. I've seen on a brochure that
this model comes in 3 heights, 900, 1200 and 1500mm. I think these jacks are
manufactured in Canada but I'm not sure. 
Anybody on the list? I'm looking for addresses, phone/fax numbers and prices.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
