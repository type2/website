Subject: Re: Importing Van from Canada

&gt;I need some help and I can't seem to find the right place to get it so
&gt;I'm asking for your help please. I am investigating the importing of a
&gt;Westfalia van from Alberta, Canada to Montana, USA. Will vans sold in
&gt;Canada from 1980 to 1990 meet US EPA and DOT standards for US
&gt;importation? Maybe you might know or direct me to someone who might.
&gt;Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide.

&gt;I have always been interested in bringing a Vanagon single or crew cab
down. Please keep us posted on how it goes.
