Subject: windshield washer fixed

Hello all,
Yesterday I finally fixed my windshield washer.  The problem was that the part
of the hose that runs up inside the steering column tube to the wiper switch was
leaking.  So I removed the steering wheel and the turn signal and wiper
switches.  Then I coaxed the faulty hose off of the windshield washer valve and
pulled it out.  This thing had holes and cracks all over it.  No wonder it
leaked.  Well, rather than replacing it with another rubber hose, I used some
spare plastic tubing that was lying around the garage, so it should now be even
more durable than when it was new!  Works like a charm now.  

Today I crawled under the car and cleaned up all the electrical connections on
the solenoid.  Hopefully this will take care of the problem as they were REALLY
corroded.  I'm kinda surprised the car starts at all.  Anyway, hopefully that's
taken care of.  

Sean
