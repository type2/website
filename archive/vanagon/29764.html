Subject: Re: mechanical to electric fuel pump.

&gt;I have come to the conclusion that the mechanical fuel pump on my '72
&gt;is bad.  It leaks on to the ground, it leaks into the oil, and it
&gt;looks original.  I checked into the price of a new one and the best i
&gt;got was about $240.  Ouch!  thats almost as much as I paid for the
&gt;bus.  The sales guy then told me that they had an electric conversion
&gt;for $60.  that sounds a lot more reasonable but i am wondering what
&gt;the merrits and trade offs will be if I decide to do this.  Has
&gt;anyone else made the conversion on their carbureted bus?  What do you
&gt;do with the hole for the mechanical? I was thinking about buying a
&gt;new gasket, pulling out the pump rod and replacing the unit as a seal.
&gt;thanks.
&gt;Ed.

I ran an electric fuel pump conversion on my 72 Westy for many K miles
after the mechanical one failed due to the engine sleeve around the pump
actuator wearing to out-of-round and causing the rod to stick.  I was also
getting lotsa fuel dilution in the oil.  It was a small unit, only about 2
x 3 x 3 inches.  A dune buggy shop in San Diego installed it, so I can't
give you details on how to disable the mechanical pump.  But, it performed
just like the stock pump.  Maybe someone else has one currently.  My 72 is
gone, but not forgot.
