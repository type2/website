Subject: Re:'87 syncro: driveshaft going?

Mark wondered:

&gt; How does one definitively check the driveshaft U joints?

I don't know how to *definitively* check them out, but when Larry's U-joints were
going, and he had a serious vibration at some speeds, you could easily feel the play -
1/4&quot;, perhaps - by wiggling the drive shaft where it attaches to the transmission end.
But his never produced any metallic &quot;clunk&quot; as torque was applied.
 
&gt; Also, Bentley says &quot;Caution: Front final drive alignment must be done to
&gt; ensure driveshaft is installed without distortion.&quot; How do you align
&gt; the front final drive?

I took that to mean that 1) You make sure no rotation took place between removal and
reinstall, ie parts are connected with the same orientation, and 2) You don't move the
final drive on its mount.  Larry was able to get his driveshaft on and off without
loosening the mounting bolts on the final drive.
