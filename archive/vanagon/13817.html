Subject: Import Service Manual--What The Heck Is It?

&gt;Quoting from a blurb in Import Service:
&gt;
&gt;After driving for an extended period of time at a constant speed, 
&gt;some water cooled Vanagon engines may loose performance or hesitate

What are you guys *talking* about with this &quot;Import Service&quot; manual? 

Where do we get our own copy? I have never heard of this document and it is
driving me crazy to have these odd references to it. 

I wanted to save a copy to my hard drive from the gopher version but there
were, like, 8 files to download and it seemed like it would take a couple of
hours and then I couldn't be sure it was prepared in such a way as to be
saved as a text file.

Joel, do you have a copy?
