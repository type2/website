So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648&quot;_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; S Johnson reminds me that his Vanagon uses troublesome liquid coolant.  NOW
&gt; how likely is mounting an aux heater from a aircooled Vgon.  My opinion:
&gt; I would ignore the water-driven heating system in this case, mount the
&gt; aux heater roughly where it goes in an air Vgon (longitudinal, left of
&gt; centerline, between floor and bellypan) and cut two holes in floor.  One
&gt; under the third seat, to take cold air in, one behind the driver to blast
&gt; hot air out.  Tying the gas heater into the water-driven heating ducts
&gt; sounds like a nightmare.
&gt; 
&gt; What do others think, who've seen these aux heaters?
&gt; B.
&gt; 

EEEERRRR!!!!!  The Bentley displayed a heater for water cooled too and
I don't mean the ones that integrate with the cooling system.  There's
another one similar to the ones used in the air-cooled vanagons.
