&gt; I agree.  Right now I have anywhere from 125-150 messages to weed through

There is no polling, there is no discussion.  It's Gerry's mailing list.
If someone wants to make a Newsgroup, then do it.

I personally sort all my mail with a program.  The only mail in my personal
mailbox, is personal mail. All the mailing lists I'm on go to thier own
folder.
