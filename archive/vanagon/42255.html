Mine is a 61 80 hp version.  It's a Crown conversion done in the late 70s 
several owners back.  I also have a 140hp 4 carb motor that I may install 
in it.  The most important thing to realize is it has a reverse 
engine rotation.  My 60 has the ring gear in a Bug's position to take 
care of this.  If you need more info, email me.
