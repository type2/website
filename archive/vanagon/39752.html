I don't know. I'm not sure under what conditions they measure this
increase. I would assume that this is not so over the entire rpm range,
but just at one point. I also *speculate* that this must be at very high
rpm, like 5,400 or 6,000 rpm, where the stock ignition system becomes
marginal. 

A much cheaper CD ignition (at $90 about 1/5 the price of Jacob's
thing-a-magic) should do a similar job. Just an opinion/guess.
