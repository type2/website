Subject: Still no go w/ sink
Date: Tue, 29 Oct 96 23:38:58 EST

Hey all,
I'm still having trouble with the sink on my *new* '81 Westy.  I tried
replacing the fuse at the pump, still no go.  Then I removed the
driver's seat to check the 16-amp fuse in that compartment.  Fuse was
OK, but I replaced it anyway.  Still nothing.  I checked the pump fuse
connecter with my test lamp and it seems like I'm not getting power at
the pump.  Does the anunciator panel have anything to do with the
operation of the sink pump?  I would think not...

I'm stumped as to where else to go.  What should I check for in this
circuit?

Sean

P.S., other than the sink not working, the Westy is great! :)
