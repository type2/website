Subject:      Re: Eurovan Awning or Screenhouse

On Wed, 13 Apr 1994 06:59:08 -0400 (EDT) Richard Sellers said:
&gt;I have a '93 Eurovan Westfalia and I'd like to have an awning or
&gt;screenhouse attached over the sliding cargo door and in a position that
&gt;does not interfere with either the cargo door or the pop-up top.
&gt;I have seen another Eurovan on the highway with just the equipment and
&gt;configuration I desire. Unfortunately at highway speeds and dodging crazy
&gt;drivers, did not allow me opportunity to ask about the source. I noted a
&gt;brand name, APOLLO on the unit.
&gt;Can someone help me with this?  Please don't pass this up since ANY
&gt;information can be more than I know right now!!
&gt;I need to know the source (name, address, telephone), model ID, Price(??),
&gt;or ANY detail or lead to follow.

ok. here goes. check out Winnebago (who are making the volkswagen camper
for 1995 ... it is a pop-top version of the eurovan). they should have
already thought about this, and (if they aren't going to make it themselves)
may have a sub-contractor/accessory maker who will make this/these accessories.
Winnebago Industries     800-64r3-4892  source: 1994 RV Buyer's Guide
Forest City, IA 50436                           page 88

i've looked through all the german books i have, and can't find any reference
to Apollo ... but they don't have too much in the way of eurovans. and Apollo
could likely be the name of the model, not the van-customizer. however, here
are the two major customizers that i know about:
Westfalia-Werke                    Dehler Yachtbau GmbH
Franz Knoebel &amp; Soehne KG          Im Langel / Postfach 3209
Postfach 2640                      D-5778 Meschede 3-Freienohl
4840 Rheda-Wiedenbrueck            Germany
Germany                            Tel. (02903) 511
 &lt;they show an awning as you       telefax (02903) 510
  describe, but for a vanagon,     telex 84935
  which has a rain gutter&gt;

hope it helps.
