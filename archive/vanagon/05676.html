&gt; 	The oil consumption confirms it. You need, at least,
&gt; new oil seals on you valves. That's why the seller is supposed to do
&gt; the smog check, and you've just convinced me that I'll have anything I
&gt; consider buying smogged BEFORE I make a final offer. 

This may be an urban (californian?) legend, but when I was shopping for
a car here in CA (I'm recent transplant), I was told that the seller had
to (by law) give a smog certificate with the car, or else they would be
liable for any repairs needed to smog the car.

The Syncro I bought came with a smog certificate.  If you're buying a used
car in CA, it might pay to visit DMV and ask them about who's liable for
repairs to a used car that doesn't pass smog.
