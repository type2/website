Subject: Sea to Mountain Trek..VWs in NC (1997)

hey now,

poor richard and i have briefly spoken about getting a group of folks together
to traverse the wild lands of North Carolina...a beautiful state with miles and
miles of deserted Outer Banks and ancient and mystic mountains. here's what we
have talked about: taking a week to travel up the outer banks, then through the
piedmont and up into the mountains possibly around boone, down to asheville
then back raleigh ways. possible stops: ocracoke, nags head, many many state
parks, boone...great driving for hearty vw freaks....explore the blue ridge
parkway...there's so much to see. i'd like to take as many back roads as
possible. skip the interstates.

while this won't be a trip like the Great Invuik Journey..it'd be a wonderful
chance for us eastern US and south eastern US vw'ers to get together. i've
been around the country, but NC has some of the most beautiful scenery and
land i've ever seen. and there's so much i haven't seen. anyone interested?

we'll talk more about this at the NC Vw campout this weekend! hope to
see you there!
