Subject: torque wrench units/sources?

Gonna be shopping for a torque wrench and noticed that most are rated 
in ft-lbs and m-kgs, but Bentley gives N-m.  If my old thermodynamics 
book is right, 1 N-m = 0.7376 ft-lb(force).  

So what's a good range torque wrench to get and where to get it?  
I'll be putting a JC Whitney order together anyway; are any of 
theirs worth getting?
