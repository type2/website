&gt; 
&gt; Last year I replaced my trunk shocks at a cost of about $60.00 (the dealer
&gt; wanted around $100.00 (?)) if I remember correctly. At Busses by the Arch, I
&gt; saw something called the LIFT LOCK on the HARVEY's van. I went to WAL MART and
&gt; got one for $6 or $7. They fit most vehicles and THEY WORK! Installation takes
&gt; all of about 2 minutes. You only need one. When you open the hatch, they lock
&gt; into place. The HARVEY's vanagon had bad hatch shocks and it kept their hatch
&gt; up. To close the hatch, you move the little arm, and close it. It takes nearly
&gt; NO EFFORT. Before you spend a wad of cash like I blindly did, check these out!
&gt;   My shocks are good but I put one on anyway. Now, even if they go bad, I
&gt; won't know it. Now... what do I do with all these little plastic parts that
&gt; came to fit other size shocks?

That sounds great Barry!  Can you tell me what department of Walmart you found
them in?

Thanks,

Steven
