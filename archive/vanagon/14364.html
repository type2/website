Please stop sending encoded binary files to the list.

If you have something binary that you want to make available, put it on 
the gopher or an ftp site or a web site.  Do NOT post it to the list.  If 
someone is willing to hassle you for a text encoded message, then do it 
personally.  This is not the kind of stuff that should end up searchable 
in the archives.

If you don't have access to the ftp or gopher kinds of tools and you want 
to make something availabe please contact me and I'll work it out with 
you off the list.


Thanks.
