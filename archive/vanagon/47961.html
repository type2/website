Subject: Re: (headsup) wasserboxer cooling system failure dujour


&gt;On one occasion last month I gashed a *NEW* rear tire 10 miles up one of 
&gt;these logging roads and guess what, yes, the wheel bolts had been 
&gt;replaced with *COMPRESSED AIR* and could I move them.....could I 
&gt;sh*tters like!  Ended up with the old Benbo photo tripod over the star 
&gt;wrench, bent the tripod and FINALLY got the bolts to crack....close call 
&gt;no AAA up here.
&gt;
&gt;BTW.  On reflection I think that the rear table stand in a westie may 
&gt;fit over the wheel wrench for added leverage *either that or WATCH the 
&gt;bloody garage uses a torque wrench on the bolts*.
&gt;
&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt;
I carry a 18&quot; breaker bar with the correct size socket in with the jack. I
can jump on this to get the wheel nut loose. It's cheap when you think of
being stuck anywhere &amp; not being able to change the tire.
