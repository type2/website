Subject:      Re: alloy wheels

&gt; I used Audi 5000 lug bolts on the front at $3.50 each.  They are a little
&gt; shorter 27mm instead of 31 or 32 mm for the $9.00 VW chrome bolts.  Works
&gt; fine; it has plenty of thread to be safe and secure.

That's good advice. I take it that these have tapered heads in stead of the
normal rounded heads (that is the back of the head where it 'centers' in
the wheel).

&gt; You do not not need
&gt; to replace the rear studs, not even sure if you have to replace the lug
&gt; nuts, but I had the VW chrome ones for the back already.

I got contradictory info on this. Some say you have to get longer lugs. The
nuts do have to be replaced though as the standards do not fit properly
because of the above mentioned tapered versus rounded backside of the nuts.


Did you buy the originals from the dealer or got them somewhere else?

BTW I bought the wheels from a VW dealer that had them 'left over', they
are used and had been laying around for a while. Unfortunately the nuts and
bolts were gone.
