&gt;Just got a little card from Solar Electric Inc. in San Diego, the
&gt;outfit from which I bought my PV panels and they're having a little
&gt;sale:
&gt;
&gt;Batteries: Trojan T105 (golf cart) 220 Ahr 6V 61#, 10x7x11, $59.
&gt;According to David Schwarze, 2 of these in series are the best
&gt;solution if you're looking into aux. power.
&gt;
&gt;Inverters: Statpower 2500W $699; 1500W $399; 1000W $299; 500W $99;
&gt;300W $69; 140W $39.
&gt;
&gt;Regulators: Collins SS 4 Amp $28; 8 Amp $35; 30 Amp $80.
&gt;
&gt;Panels: Trilam 80W, 4.8 Amp, 16.5 V (three 1'x4' series) $297.
&gt;Unisolar 2nd, 22W, 1.4Amp, 15.6V, 1'x4', $149.
&gt;11W $99; Trickle 5W, 0.3A $59; 6V, 0.3A $29.
&gt;Flexible surplus EDU/OEM ~6V/30mA $2.

I like Solar Electric and everything, but those look like their normal
prices to me.
