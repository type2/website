&gt; Collant bleeder valve

Dan Houg responds:&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Your valve is not defective, just unscrew it all the way and then 
&gt; gently *pull* back on the stem.  It will come out about 1/4&quot; or so 
&gt; more and prodigious quantities of air and  coolant will flow!  Things 
&gt; they don't 
&gt; teach you in school, eh?  Also, here is an easy way to bleed the 
&gt; system at the front of the van.  Take out the top radiator plug per 
&gt; coolant bleeding procedure but then attach a fluid recovery jar and 
&gt;  a vacuum source to the screw hole.  Suck out the air - keep refilling 
&gt; the coolant jug and you're set. Let me know if you folks want a more 
&gt; verbose description of this whole process.  It really works.
&gt; 

Well nobody else has responded, so let me throw in a request. I suspect
that my problem is not understanding what a vacuum source is, but if you're
willing to give me a quick lecture, I'd appreciate it. Thanks
