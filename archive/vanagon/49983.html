So Chris Pittack says:
&gt; Hey Ya'll
&gt; 
&gt; The PO of Lewis smoked (Cigarettes!)...damn those POs...and I've been
&gt; trying to get the bad smells out.  I recall a while back there was some
&gt; heated discussion on how to get the bad smells out of your rig,
&gt; specifically the seats. Following your advise I steam cleaned the seats
&gt; and removed/washed the carpets.  Now a couple of months later Lewis
&gt; smells like a combination of smoke and carpet cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; How do you get the ALL the bad smells out, how do you clean the
&gt; headliner, how do I get rid of the carpet cleaner smell?

Hmmm...  Sounds like you need a *large* box of Arm &amp; Hammer baking
soda.  Sprinkle it all over the interior of your van and then leave
the remainder of the box with the top off and just leave it in the
galley of your van for a while or pour the rest of the A &amp; H into
a suitable container that you can secure so that you can drive around
with it in your bus.
