Subject: 81 spilling gas. Rubber Grommet anyone??

  I have an 81 air-cooled vanagon. When I top it off the tank gasoline
gushes all over the ground. I have traced the problem to the two fat vent
tubes on the peaks of the passenger and drivers' side of the gas tank. One
side of the tubes blew out when I filled it up so I tried to push it in
again. I unknowingly pulled the other side out because the cross tube is
too short.

  What I am missing is the rubber grommet the &quot;probe&quot; fits into. Is there a
vw part number? or can I use any old rubber grommet
