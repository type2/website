&gt; 
&gt; don't know tons about the synchro, but isn't it more like a limited slip
&gt; differential, rather than true 4WD? BTW I have heard that the Synchro's get
&gt; shocking fuel economy.

1. It is a limited slip front diff.
2. On my 86 Synchro, fuel economy ranges from 16 MPG to 21 MPG. Granted,
   this is not anywhere like a GEO Metro, but certainly not shocking.
