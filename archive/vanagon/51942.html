A&amp;E Systems, a subsidiary of Dometic (the company that makes the Westfalia
fridges) makes a nice awning that fits Vanagons. The model is the &quot;Catalina&quot;
and you can order brackets that fit the rain gutter. No drilling or cutting
of the Vanagon is required.  The awnings are available mail order from
Camping World.
