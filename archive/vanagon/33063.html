&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; I'm the guy with the '77 westy that may need a rebuild.  A compression test
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Finally, how much should I
&gt; &gt; expect to pay for 4 cylinders, pistons and rings 
&gt; 
&gt; If you have to buy cylinders, etc., it will depend on the size of your 
&gt; pistons (or the size you're installing). JC Whipme (actually Whitney) 
&gt; sells 85.5 mm sets for $84.95 and 90.5 sets for $149.95. If your engine's 
&gt; stock, I'll bet (but don't count on this) that you use the latter. You 

I don't think so.  Your 77 has a 2-liter engine which uses 94mm p[istons
and liners.  The cheapest I could find them was $299/set.  And, the
prices were purported to be going up.  Those pistons and liners in the
JC WhipMe catalog are for type I (i.e. beetle) engines.

&gt; with a smile; no hassles. I believe you can buy *new* heads for around 
&gt; $150 each, though new heads may give you no better service than good 
&gt; condition heads with new or good valves.

I bought rebuilts at GEX for $129 each.  The 2-liter heads are more, I
think $179 each.  If I could have found new heads for $150, I would have
been all over them, but I didn't know they were avaliable.  I'd be
interested to know where they were being sold.  I will NOT buy anything
from GEX again - their quality is very poor in my experience.

If you don't hear any expensive noises, and you know the history of this
bus, change the oil and leave the bottom end alone, unless you have $800
to spend on it.  At least that's my advice.
