Subject: Re: VW Electrical contact enhancer

I have heard of a compount that, in the presence of an electrical current=

(the contact point of a connector) becomes conductive.  Also, where there=

is no current, it becomes more insulative.  It is used in the aerospace
industry.  This MIGHT be similar.  Not just a contact cleaner

If it's just contact cleaner, you can get some from Radio Schreck for
$2.95.

&gt;&gt;This came up on the VW usenet group and I thought that I would pass the=

&gt;&gt;info along for anyone(everyone?) else who may have problems with the
&gt;&gt;electrical connections on their FI.  The stuff is called Stabilant 22A
and
