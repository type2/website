So Maher, Steve says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I love my bay window too.  But I would love to have a '50's single or 
&gt; crew
&gt; &gt;&gt; cab.  Those are soooo cool, as Mr. Kenyon well knows. ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But they don't have cruise control!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Or /showers.
&gt; 

Or Prune recipes!!!  ;)
