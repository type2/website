RE:	Copy of: What is a Westy Weekender?

&gt;   Hi All,
     
&gt;  This may seem like an obvious question to most of you but, how is a 
&gt; Westy Weekender different from a Westy.  I have not seen a Weekender 
&gt; in person yet.

Hi, Vince, I would imagine you are talking about a '85-'86 Wolfsburg Edition
Westy Vanagon non-GL. 

This model, typically called the Wolfsburg Weekender Westy  (WWW) for lack of a
better name, is a base camper model that does not have sink or stove, but does
have a large Dometic electric fridge that can be bolted down or easily removed,
right inside the sliding door, behind the pass. seat. The fridge is considerably
larger than the ones in the full camper Westy's. This model comes with the
wonderful &quot;self shredding&quot; tan corduroy interior, and the paint colors I have
seen have either been white, or Brown metallic. this model had a fold out table
from the left wall ala Carat style, with the integrated cup holders in the
plastic side panel (I think the cup holders come broken from the factory)
Behind the drivers seat, there is a rear facing jump seat that the bottom
cushion lifts up backwards to reveal storage underneath. The rear seat folds out
into a sofabed, and since there aren't any cabinetsto the left of the sofabed,
it goes right to the left wall. There is a cabinet in the rear overhead and in
then left rear. And of course there is the full Westy poptpop. This model, and
the '90-'91 Multivan, are my personal favorites because they still are campers,
but you have alot more room inside for carrying stuff since there aren't all
those cabinets that take up space.
