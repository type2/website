Subject: RE: Another Syncro For Sale

&gt;I passed this one at a parking lot at my workplace:

&gt;'87 Westfalia Syncro 4x4, w/ Lockable Rear Diff.
&gt; A/C, Aux batt
&gt;$8500
		     
&gt;Oh...it has 46375 miles in the odometer. It looks in decent 
&gt;shape with on sheetmetal damage other than the odd bush scratch
&gt;and a dent in the rear bumper. It was dirty and looks like it 
&gt;has spent some time on dirt roads.
	
&gt;The interior seemed in decent shape.

&gt;It's silver...

FYI all, said Syncro is now parked in my driveway in Seattle.

Thanks for all the help!

Paul
