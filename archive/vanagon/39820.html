Subject: Misc Vanagon parts for sale

I just parted out a 1988 Vanagon and have some parts for sale. 
Automatic transmission (48K miles).
Rear folding seat (turns into bed) , Blue velour no rear cushion. 
Front seats  (Blue velour).
Power steering rack. Steering wheel, door panels,power mirrors.
Upper front grill (no cracks). 
Headlight assemblies, air conditioner compressor. 
Front and rear wiper motors.
Front disk brake (complete).
Computer.
There may be other parts that I can't think of at the moment.
I also have a sliding panel door for a 1968 bus. 
Rear hatch (with wiper motor) for vanagon.
Since I will be replacing the motor in my 85 camper with the 2.1 
motor from the 88 I may be interested in selling the 1.9  motor.
It has approx 120k miles and has a leak on the driver side head.
I also have a partially disassembled 1.9.
If any one needs any parts give me a shout. 

Thanks.
