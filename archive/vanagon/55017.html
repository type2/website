Subject: Squeaking suspension
Date: Sun, 26 Jan 1997 21:00:33 -0000

On my 84 GL with 183k miles:

Rear:
The rear suspension squeaks whenever it goes up and down especially at low
speed over speed bumps. Could it be the shock absorbers? What happens when
shocks begin to wear out eg do they get harder or softer?

Front:
The front also squeaks when going up and down but because of the higher
pitch and shorter duration I suspect springs rather than shocks. I can get
this by pushing down on the wheel arch. In comparison the rear is more like
a long woosh than a quick squeak.

What is the story on suspension squeaks? Rubber bits? Springs? Shocks?
Grease needed?
