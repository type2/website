&gt;Johnny,

&gt;        welcome to the internet. :)

&gt;        This urban legend has been circulating for a number of years,
&gt;is untrue, and the recipe (reportedly) actually makes lousy cookies.
&gt;
&gt;        Hmmm, think I'm gonna make some cookies tonight... this is

It is unfortunate that sarcasm cannot relay itself across the screen as
easily as the spoken drawl spit forth from one's lips...

Regards,
