Subject: &lt;syncro&gt;  S-D-P fax no.?


Any syncro folks got a fax # for these people that works?

I have tried   011-43-316-401322, given me by both VW-SA and P. Oudot of
French Syncro club, no go.  

011  is Canadian overseas access
43   is Austria
rest is S-D-P #?

they are in Graz, Austria.


What am I doing wrong?  Thanks. Tim
