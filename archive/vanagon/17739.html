Subject: 59 single cab question

Hello and thank you

Can I put my spare 1600 (70) engine into my 59 (If I make all the necessary
6 volt conversion). The 36 hp sure looks tiny compared to the 1600. I havent
measured anything or actually thought about it a lot, but I saw a post were
someone said that this engine would more or less fit back to 55.

My wifes bug engine is still running warm (tiny voice...help me...help me)
