Subject: re: My bus parts Stolen!!

Sorry to hear about all the parts that got stolen, it's really *sic*
to conclude that it must be VW enthusiasts as well, actually VW *FREAKS*
is more appropriate, #_at_GRR$*&amp;)!

A few years back my BajaBug rearfenders disapppeared from a project
car that was parked outside. i always suspected a particular guy,
(easy we have only two of those i town :)  ) but i couldn't prove it,
until someone metioned to me that the fenders he had were indeed the
 ones that got stolen from me, so i called the guy and said: &quot;hi,
remember me? i'm the one who supplied your rear fenders, you forgot
to pay for them&quot; i told him i wanted the new price for them and he
promptly agreed with that.over the years i had more parts stolen
though, mainly by people breaking into a garage i had, the only thing
i missed was a hydraulic floor jack, but i'm sure they took more than
that alone.

Brian.
