The main reason why you need a fan is that when the inside is filled with
stuff (not really hard to do...), convection doesn't circulate the cool air
from the evaporator very well.   We found that it made a significant
difference.

&gt;Does anyone know this for sure.  Not anecdotal evidence but scientific ( I
&gt;will settle for pseudo scientific) evidence.  I recently had my fridge
&gt;serviced at an RV place that knew the 182B backwards and forwards.  They
&gt;really impressed me with their ability and knowledge.  I asked them about
&gt;the fan since they had some for sale.  They said that you don't need it for
&gt;the 182B (thus denying themselves a sale of a fan to me).  I must admit it
&gt;works well without it (although I haven't tried making ice cubes).
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone out there have any data on this?
