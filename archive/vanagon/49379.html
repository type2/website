1969 912 EE Silver, 120k+ miles, $1500.00 obo
    ---------------
Rare European edition with the power sunroof, different interior/exterior
trim
packages.  No fender rust, and tolerable floor rust.  The 1600cc dual carb
engine
produces 90 DIN hp (120 SAE hp), but it doesn't work.  I really do not
wish to
sell my car, but as a grad student I just don't have the means to have it
fixed
properly....
