So Dave Kautz says:

  Interiors remained nearly identical through the 1973 model year. When the
  pop-top changed in 1974, it was not longer possible to vent the sink 
  throught the roof and it was moved to the left &lt;drivers&gt; side and vents
  throught the wall below the passenger window. The water system got an
  electric pump at the same time. 
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Does anyone know about the chances of said electric pump fitting my 
'71?  It doesn't work at all now.  Somewhere I have the name of a 
place that sells rebuild kits for these.  If a '74 or newer pump would
fit I could salvage one and then rebuild it.  Yes?  No?  Indifferent?
