Subject: Tranny Support for Engine Removal

Greetings all,

My weekend engine pulling, gas tank cleaning is almost upon me. Here is my
question:

What makes a good tranny support? I was thinking of using a marine tie down
strap. I think it is rated at something like 6000 pounds. I t seems much
easier to handle than a chain and board. Hell, I would think a good nylon
rope, with the proper knot, would support the tranny. Am I wrong? I don't
want to get a chain, my flat is so full of junk/car parts/tools I don't
think it can hold much more, but if I really need a chain I guess I could
get one and hang it on the wall when I'm done for that dungeon look.

My house really is that full of &lt;&lt;stuff&gt;&gt;.
Ken (that's not a table saw, it's a kitchen table)
