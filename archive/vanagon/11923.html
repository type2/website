Subject: help! with motor I.D.

          I have a '66 bus, kombi, I believe.  The VIN #'s match title
          and the book shows them to indeed be '66.  The motor is
          another story.  It is a 1600, verified by two knowledgable
          mechanics (one at a dealer that I trust - I know, I know!).
          The problem is the motor has NO #'s, anywhere.  It does have
          VW jugs, not aftermarket.  Do I assume the cases are
          aftermarket?  How do I I.D. this motor, as in Type II or III
          maybe?  Are there subtle differences anywhere that would
          give me solid clues?  I realise I may be asking for too much
          but clues would make me happy.  I've searched the books but
          engine #'s seem to be required and I have none.  HELP!  I
          don't even know why I want to know but eventually it will
          probably come in handy.  I've replaced exhaust system and
          clutch with very few parts problems so far.
          p.s. - thanks to all who responded re: pop-out windows.  I
          think I have found two possible sources that I can actually
          get to in a days drive.  I appreciate it.
