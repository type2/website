Subject: Vanagon Archives Administrator Survey


If this is a common occurence for you, could you please e-mail me?
I want to know how the performance is. It seems pretty darned quick from here,
but that is no indication of how it is from somewhere else in the country.


Thanks for your input.

&gt;        I get this a lot as well.  Can anyone tell me why this is?  
&gt;      Searching the archives can be tedious because you get this message a 
&gt;      lot when you try to open files from the achieves as well.  I find 
&gt;      myself canceling out of loading any archived message if it takes more 
&gt;      than ten seconds to load.  I go to other files or try again 
&gt;      immediately after canceling.  I usually have success the second or 
&gt;      third time but man can this be *TEDIOUS*.  Here is the current address 
&gt;      just in case you are trying an old URL.
