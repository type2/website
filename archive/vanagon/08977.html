Subject: New to this list-


Hey all-

	Well, my elder brother (Bill Abbott, '70 Single Cab) sent me 
enough stuff gleaned from this list to convice me to subscribe also. 
So far, it looks like fun!

	My wife and I have an '88 Vanagon, Wolfsburg Edition, in dark 
metallic blue. Bought it used three years ago, it's been to eight 
western states and British Columbia with us, and it's a real joy. Oh- 
it's got about 125K on the odometer, about 21K from us.

	But am I the only one out there who's torn the air 
conditioning out of his van? The A/C didn't work when I bought the 
van, and I didn't personally care for it- it made the engine bay 
cluttered, and the big plenum/control thingie over the windshield made 
the windshield seem too small. I left it alone for a while, but I 
finally got sick of hitting my head on the duct that ran the length of 
the roof- really a pain when making the bed, etc. And, how could I 
criticize those who blow holes in the ozone while continuing to 
consume freon myself?

	So, in a fit of ugly passion, I excised the A/C from the van, 
and have been very happy with the result. Now the windshield looks 
bigger, I don't hit my head on that stupid duct, the engine is easier 
to work on, and my conscience is clear about the ozone layer!

	Or, maybe I'm just a nut. It's entirely possible.

	Anyway, it's great to be here!
