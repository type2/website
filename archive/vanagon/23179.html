    I.D: I.O.T.T.

Insane Drivers - Inuvik or Toast Tour

The last time I checked, the windscreen of my '65 bus is nice flat glass,
easy to replace with the side window of an old Chevy.  Actually, I was
thinking of coming on the trip just so there would be a REAL bus available to
pull you through the deep spots.  Or
mebbe I could find a Jeep with no engine in Whitehorse...
