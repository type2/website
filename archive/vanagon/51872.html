Subject:       Vanagon shocks /suscribe to list 

Hello

Could anyone suggeest an inexpensive shock for my Vanagon that will hold 
up reasonably well? I'm aware of the discussions on the KYB gas adjusts. Are 
there any other options or are these the only show in town? 

I'd also like to suscribe to this list
