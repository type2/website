Jon:

The 022 head of which you speak are NOT the 1.8 heads, but rather early
2.0 liter heads.  They came in the 76,77, and 78 Buses with fuel injection
and as such have rather smallish valve specs. The are the same spec as the
071 heads of the air-cooled vanagon, but utilize the earlier style &quot;oval&quot;
exhaust port -vs- the squarish ports of the laterr models.

SPECS

022.101.372G

37.5mm intake
33.0mm exhaust   ***Sodium Filled exhaust valves !!
Cylinder Head Temp sensor on one head (G I think), other blank.

As I said before, it is a fuel-injected head...

p.s. be r.e.a.l. careful installing new exhaust valve guides as the guide
walls are of a differrent thickness..Getting the wrong ones (or having NAPA
put in the wrong ones) can result in a cracked and useless head....

Kevin
