Subject:  quality 1600 rbldr, san diego?

My '71 camper may need a new engine (sigh!).  I am in San Diego and do 
not want to spend more that $1k for a rebuilt 1600 w/new heads, including 
installation.  Is this unreasonable?  My present engine is a 1641 and 
runs way too hot (210-250), lately its been so hot i can't touch it, even 
the tin around the heater hoses etc is hot.  I would appreciate it if 
anyone knew of a good, honest rebuilder in the san diego area, preferably 
one who would install it too.  I have been to Randy's and he wants $1,600 
for a 1600 installed.  I am willing to go to L.A. to get the engine if I 
have to.  Thanks!

Ted Morrison
