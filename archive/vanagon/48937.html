Yes, it is possible to connect batteries into parallel. (Do your Westy
have no second unit? :-O ) But you have to take care of starting the
engine after a camping weekend using light, radio, fridge... Campers
have a disconnector relay behind the glove compartment in the right
front. It disconnects the starter battery from the secondary and is
powered by the ignition switch. The second battery finds it's place
under drivers seat.

If you will add a battery by yourself I recommend to add a time delay
for powering the disconnector relay. It have to connect the batteries
while engine is running, not during the starting process. 30 sec will
a good choice. Other ideas?

The disconnector relay should be a heavy duty type, like 40 Amps. 10 Amps
relay will also work and are used by Volkswagen if Vanagons are delivered
with two batteries.
