Subject: Gas heater wanted...

As I mull over what seems to be a job offer (YOW!) in Colorado, at 8,000 
feet above sea level, it occurs to me that my 78 heating system, which 
isn't sufficient here in wintertime Seattle, may not be at all sufficient 
there...
So I need a gas heater. Guess I'm not happy with the potential for 
conflagration already lurking in my engine compartment -- I need more.

If anyone has one (Eber., etc.) they're willing to part with, or knows 
the whereabouts of one to be had: please email me =)

Thanks much!
