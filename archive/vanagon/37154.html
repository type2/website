Subject: wire harness
Date: Fri, 8 Mar 1996 14:38:02 -0500 (EST)

I am a former list member now mailing from off the list.  I am
in search of the great and wonderful wire harness to remedy my
stalling problem on my 86' gl.  I have contacted the dealer
about Part No. 025 906 302 A and was told that it runs for
$130.  Is thsi a little high???  Are there any other sources
for this part??  Any suggestions on what I might do before
giving in to the (dealer)man??
any help is much appreciated!!

Again I am not on the list so any responses should be directed
to spr9c_at_fermi.clas.virginia_dot_edu.  Thanks!!!
