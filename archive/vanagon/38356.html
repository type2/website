Subject: Re: pre 1968 westy roofrack question

Over here the people that make repro racks (good ones) use something called
smooth Hammerite.._dot_comes in little aerosols..I have just used it to freshen up
our repro rack..its a sort of matt silver grey finish and looks fine. A friend
has a Westfalia rack however which is just polished metal....
