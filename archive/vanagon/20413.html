&gt; On the subject of ventilation...
&gt; 
&gt; On my last excursion to West Virginia I tied hanging mosquito 
&gt; netting across the sliding door opening with magnets. This 
&gt; worked pretty well. The only problem was one night the mosquitos 
&gt; were aggressive and would work their way in. So I'm thinking of 
&gt; gluing Velcro around the door opening and sewing Velcro to the
&gt; netting. Has anyone else tried this?

Get some citrinella oil and spray it around the van and on the net. It works nicely. ANother thing
that worked well for me was a bee-bee gun. Shoot the blood-sucking beasts!
