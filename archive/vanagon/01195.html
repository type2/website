&gt; I require the seal that goes around the outside of the engine tin 
&gt; between the engine and the engine compartment (body).  The local VW guy 
&gt; here in Guelph (Ontario, Canada) wants 90$.  I find this alittle high for 
&gt; this peice of foam rubber.  Anyone know where I could get it cheaper or a 
&gt; way to substitute?  TIA

Check the VW mags.  I paid around $25 for mine, and I thought THAT was bad.
