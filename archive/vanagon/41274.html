&gt;I resent the idea that this is one persons' mailing list.  If this is the
&gt;case, I'd rather not be here.  I don't want to be intruding on someone's
&gt;personal territory.

It is one person's mailing list. By convention, lists are owned by their
administrators. Newsgroups are owned by their readers.

(Newsgroups are also fair game for every Internet psychopath with nothing
to do. But if you want to start one, have at it. You don't need our
permission.)
