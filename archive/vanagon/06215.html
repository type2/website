OK, I'll bite too!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the slow reply, but I'm with the group that favors the
&gt; coast instead of the Sierras (at least during winter).  Someone
&gt; mentioned the campgrounds by Morro Bay.  Montana de Oro and
&gt; Los Osos state parks are choice.   Plus, us surfers can do our
&gt; best imitations of shark food at Morro Rock.
&gt; 
&gt; Pick a weekend, any weekend.

Count me in (barring unexpected events and plans).  One advantage of the
coast, for those of us who live to the north of all you Californicaters, is
that we don't have to drive through the mountains in the winter, a big plus
for those of us who hate sliding around in our precious buses!  I vote for the
coast too, but if it's in the mountains somewhere I'll do my best to get
there in one piece!  I DO favor something a little more north than some of the
places I've heard suggested, even Morro Bay is a damn long drive for a long
weekend from up here.

Lemme know when and where...

John,
and Bobo, the `74 bus that REALLY hates doing 360s on ice!
