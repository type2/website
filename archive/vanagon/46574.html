Subject: Re: POSSABLE PROBLEMS

&gt;I JUST BOUGHT A 71 CAMPMOBILE,  BROUGHT IT HOME(ON A TRAILER) WILL NOT
&gt;RUN. THE GUY I BOUGHT IT FROM RAN IT HOT (HOT ENOUGH TO MELT SEALS AROUND
&gt;PLUG WIRES) THE ENGINE STILL TURNS FREELY,BUT HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD THERE
&gt;BE?,,I MEAN, WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FORWARD TO.. WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST ,,
&gt;TRY TO START THE ENGINE OR JUST TAKE IT OUT AND REBUILD IT??
&gt;
&gt;ANY COMMENTS AND SUGESTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL..
&gt;
&gt;                                           RICHARD
Check the oil.
Check the plugs.
Check the valves.
Report back.
