&gt;&gt; Have you considered that you may have been bucking a headwind on the start
&gt;&gt; of your journey, and had a tailwind to blow you home?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; When I'm driving west on a long journey, the drive can get a little shaky
&gt;&gt; because I am driving into the wind.  We've all experienced the mix of a
&gt;&gt; strong wind and the Bus' handling characteristics.  But driving east, I get
&gt;&gt; blown all the way across the states, and my gas mileage is a lot better!

I certainly thought of it, since one trip was in a hellacious wind (very
frequent around these parts) but since this is so consistent, I discarded
this option early.  As for Joel's suggestion, the exhaust pipe (not the one
that was on the Bus when I bought it) is black, so likely no vacuum problem,
nor does Otto produce his own oil.  I rather like the astral theories myself.  

Thanks folks!
