Subject:      What a deal! Also, clutch stuff

What a deal! Here is what is currently listed at traderonline (no
foolin)

1986, VOLKSWAGEN, VAN, asking $ 1, Syncro 4x4 7 Passenger Clean family year round ride! #470CDB, (206) 672-1177.


Also, I'm currently having clutch problems in my 85; the
clutch master cylander is leaking, but I'm wondering how you can
decisively tell which (if both) is shot. Also, what is the procedure
for bleeding the clutch system?

I'm planning a trip to London/Europe in December and would
like to visit the VW factory and other stuff (along with doing
ancestry research). I'll be on the watch for noteworthy items,
along with seeing about renting one of those Westies in Germany
while I'm there. In other travel notes; I've got a picture of a couple
vans and bugs that I took last time I was in Kathmandu that I'll post soon.
