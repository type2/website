Subject: Extra oil burning

I just went from MA to CA in my '85 Vanagon
It seems to not like extra crankcase oil.

That is, it tends to burn it off in a real
thick cloud of smoke for about 5 minutes
Then run clean until it needed more.

Also the oil light likes to flicker at idle,
i.e. Add 1 quart and ignore the flicker
at tolls or add 2 quarts and choke.

What's up here?
