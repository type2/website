Subject: Re: Vacation!!

&gt;My wife and I and two 6 week old kitties are leaving on vacation in 4 
&gt;days. Call me crazy, but we are picking up our two new kitties and 
&gt;heading from Indianapolis to Charleston South Carolina to visit our 
&gt;daughter. She's working on the new movie with Jim Carry called Ace 
&gt;Ventura Pet Detective does something, or something like that. I will be 
&gt;driving my 1971 blue Riviera conversion camper (Blushie, named after my 
&gt;Godmother who willed me the money to fix her up). Blushie has never been 
&gt;this far from home before, and doesn't have a great track record on 
&gt;shorter trips.

Captain,

She just won't take any more!

Get blushie checked before the trip I say, far easier than renting a U-haul
&amp; tow dolly.

Do the valve thing, including pushing up and down on the retainers so you
can see if the guides are really up to the trip.  If you get alot of
movement in the valves, think carefully and/or drive very conservatively.
Do the end play check, push foward and pull backward on the crank pulley, it
should barely noticable (.006&quot; or less).

If you've got the basics covered you should be OK, a tune-up and oil change
couldn't hurt, unless the mechanics a clown, always a possibility.

Carry a spare fan belt and the tools to change it, a fuel pump is sometimes
nice too.

Nice kitties, don't forget water.

Good luck '71
Eug,
