Subject: Insane Syncro Prices!!!
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 94 14:52:34 PDT

So Jim Macklow says:
&gt; 
&gt; Saw a '90 Syncro Camper for sale at one of the local repair shops.
&gt; 
&gt; 47K miles
&gt; Here's the killer... I saw the &quot;sale&quot; sticker on the side, so I walked
&gt; in and asked what his price was.  $24,500!!!  Derek Drew, don't die 
&gt; laughing at this absurd price.  The guy told me with a straight face
&gt; that people's mouths drop when they hear the price, or they just walk 
&gt; out without another word.  I just started laughing, until he said, very
&gt; seriously, &quot;Well, someone will pay that much.&quot;  
&gt; 

Quite franky, I don't see what's so hilarous either considering the
availability and demand for the Syncro.
