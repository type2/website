Subject: ANOTHER BUS BURNS !!!!!!!!

 Alas, tragedy struck a friend of mine yesterday, when her bus burned
completely up driving across town. She was able to save her dog, but lost most
of her stuff with the bus. It was a new bus for her, so she hadn't had time to
buy a fire extinguisher, or check the fuel lines. Well, there's plenty of time
now, since the bus won't be moving from the junkyard any time soon.
  People, this is the THIRD friend of mine that has had a new bus burn up on
them. I can't stress enough how important it is to buy a fire extinguisher. I
have another friend that's had a Beetle and a Bus catch on fire, but since he
had an extinguisher, there was only minimal damage, instead of a total loss.
Even though you might not ever need it, you also have the option of helping out
someone else, instead of just standing there.
 Of course, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so any time you
buy a new bus, or have had yours for a while, CHECK ALL YOUR FUEL LINES AND
CONNECTIONS. Especially if the bus has been sitting a while, you don't want a
crusty, dried up piece of 20 year old rubber carrying your fuel supply.
Anyway, I hope this will reach someone out there, and save not only your bus,
but possibly your life. Please, please, fire safety is nothing to be slack
about.
