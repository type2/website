Subject: Fram Oil filters


&gt;   complaint of a flickering oil light at idle, 52,000 miles on van.  
&gt;   They put a guage on and indeed it was low.  They were just about to 
&gt;   start by putting an oil pump in it when they noticed the Fram filter. 
&gt;    They changed to a Volkswagen one and immediately gained 5 psi at hot 
&gt;
The 'by-the-book' people used to warn me of dangers of cheap oil
filters exactly for this reason.  This is the first plausible
story I've heard about them.  (Still, It is originating from a dealer???)

I guess that the explanation was that the pores on those cheap filters
got clogged too easily and impeded the flow of oil through them, thereby
causing a greater than normal pressure drop across the filter, which, then,
gets subtracted from the oil pressure applied to the engine, etc., etc.....
