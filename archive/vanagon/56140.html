Subject: Driver's side mirror/ '80 V6anagon for sale


I need a left-side rearview mirror for an '80 Vanagon--- other years
will probably fit. It's not remote-control. Anyone have one laying
around?

Please reply privately to smaher_at_gi_dot_com since I'm not currently on
the list-- mail volume is just too heavy!  :(

Also, the van it's for, is for sale. It's an '80 Vanagon L, with a
Chevy 2.8L V6 engine and an Kennedy Engineered Products adapter kit.
A few dings and rust spots, nothing serious, runs well, tires have
about 5K miles on them. Has a real heater from a Volvo, and a temp
gauge you can actually believe! It has had clutch problems in the
past, which have not recurred, but...?

Current clutch (uses the standard '80 Vanagon clutch and 4-sp trans)
has about 10K miles on it. Nice torquey little engine, accelerates
up hills in 4th, keeps up with traffic! I'd guess it has about the
same power as most minivans-- quite a change from the VWs I was used to!

Have a look at it on http://www.wp_dot_com/IrishMafia
