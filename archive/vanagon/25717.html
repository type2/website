Subject: RE: Temperature Related Performance Problems

Just thought that I would let you know I had the same problem with my &quot;91 
Transporter. After a few nasty letters VW Australia supplied an impendane 
harness to fit to the air flow meter FREE OF CHARGE.
My argument was that it was a known defect and that it should be fixed 
free of charge - they didn't like it a first but were quite helpfull at 
the end.

regards
Brett

&gt; John,

&gt; Your first problem may be the well known, but perhaps poorly understood 
&gt; problem that many water cooled Vanagons have.  The way to know for sure is 
&gt; to stop when the problem starts to occur, turn off the engine, immediately 
&gt; re-start the engine and continue driving.  If the problem has cleared up, 
&gt; you have the well known problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I just told you what the work around is.  There is a wiring harness fix 
&gt; available from VW for $200(?).  Also, other folks have found a fix by 
&gt; adding a few parts to the computer or wiring harness.  Perhaps someone else 
&gt; on this list can point you to server that holds the extensive discussion on 
&gt; this subject.
&gt; 
&gt; I use the work around.
