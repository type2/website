Subject: Cost of restoring 67
Date: Thu, 4 Apr 1996 16:53:03 -0800

One of the best money saving things to look for when buying a bus is =
making sure everything is there.  I'm restoring a 67 Deluxe that had all =
the original trim, clock, gas gauge &amp; seats.  If I had to buy all this =
stuff, I'd be homeless.  I would be at the offramp of a major freeway =
with a sign &quot;WILL WORK FOR BUS PARTS&quot;. =20

Take your time and buy the right on, not the first one you've ever =
looked at.  I got lucking, my bus was the second one I looked at.  I =
bought it for $600 without the engine.  The first one was the same =
price, but was stripped.

It's been a lot of fun, but I'm not even close to being finished.  If =
you take your time you will thank yourself when your done.

Good luck,
Erik Thomsen
