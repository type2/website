Subject: Re: Bay Window Shocks

Last weekend I put KYB Gas-a-just shocks on my 59' Bus.  Of course they were 
easy to install and they work great!  No more bouncing and a heck of a lot less 
vibrations and rattling.  Handles better as well.  We will see how long they 
last! 
                                                    Good luck
