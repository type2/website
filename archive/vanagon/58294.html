Subject: CCC's tomorrow's recon. trip


Anyone want to join us (caravan) to go up and check out the site
near Quincy tomorrow?  We figure we'll leave the bay area
around 9 a.m., and leave the Sacramento area around 11 a.m.  It's
not an overnight, no camping, just a quick run up and have a look see.

Lemme know ASAP
