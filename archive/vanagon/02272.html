&gt;
&gt;When I had to haul a heavy trailer with my little Isuzu pickup, a
&gt;mechanic suggested that I install air shocks.  Now I can go to the
&gt;air pump at the gas station and raise or lower the rear end of my
&gt;pickup perhaps 4 inches.  Maybe more...  I don't know if this is
&gt;germain to this discussion and the ones we had regarding vans which
&gt;were low in the back, but it's a thought.
&gt;
&gt;The air shocks weren't too expensive; I seem to recall about $100
&gt;installed.

	Air shocks sound good, maybe you can even make
	your van hump up and down like some bloated low-rider!

	Anybody have airshocks on their van?
