Subject: RE: Propane fill-up

&gt;Today; we went to fill up the BBQ and Westy propane tanks at Superior
&gt;propane in Ottawa. The BBQ tank was no problem; but the fellow could not
&gt;get the nozzle to fit the Westy tank (this will be our first fill-up). The
&gt;problem was not the nozzle itself which was the right diameter and thread
but
&gt;that the &quot;protector plate&quot; below the tank prevented the right &quot;angle of
&gt;attack&quot;. These are big nozzles used to fill up taxis. I have two questions.
&gt;a) has anyone else had this problem and b) does anyone in Ottawa know of
&gt;a place other than Superior that fills tanks? 
&gt;Thanks in advance.

Guys,

Probably a silly question but are your taxis running on LP (liquid petroleum)
gas or propane?  There is a considerable difference in the butane content of
the two fuels and LP gas is not suitable for burning in propane cookers and
heaters.  I am not sure whether it is a health/fume or flammability thing but
in AUS it is strictly verboten to fill propane cylinders from the LP gas
pumps.....

In terms of filling a propane cylinder/tank you do just loosen the 'safety'
or filler valve and fill the tank until gas starts squirting out the valve
(theoretically should be located on the top of the tank even if tank is
horizontal?) - then close the valve fully and stop the fill.  

(It is actually safer to have the valve fully open and squirting *for
non-smokers anyway 8-)*.. than have it shut when filling..._dot_depends whether
you want a fire or pressure explosion.  Actually it's pretty safe - I think
you'd find not enough oxygen in that plume to burn....)
