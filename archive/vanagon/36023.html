&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; Writing this partly in hopes of causing the digest to spew another
&gt; one before I go home for the day... ;-)  (I think I'm addicted, and I
&gt; don't even have a bus yet...)
&gt; 
&gt; But, mainly, I've been wondering: what are the pros &amp; cons for the
&gt; Westy models, late-70s &amp; early 80s. (aircooled only)
&gt; 
&gt; I've sort of decided the Vanagon style is more practical (ie: larger,
&gt; usually more standard camping features, etc.), but I still like the
&gt; 'funkiness' of the earlier bus style. I like driving both, but don't
&gt; quite get that 'feeling' when driving the Vanagon vs. the bus. Am I
&gt; nuts...?
&gt; 
&gt; So.... what I'm really asking is: are they any major problems with a
&gt; 70s Westy vs an 80s one, especially with the camping ability? It
&gt; seems that late 70s &amp; early 80s models are about the same price range
&gt; around here, but the 70s are *much* easier to find. I've been passing
&gt; over most 70s models since they seem overpriced (ie: $5000-7000 CDN!)
&gt; compared to an 80+ model (most around $5000-9000), but now I'm
&gt; wondering if I should start looking closer at them.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, my wife prefers the Vanagon, probably because I feel (and
&gt; act) about 10 years younger (I'm 28) when driving a bus....  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Did any of that make sense...? Good thing it's Friday...!
&gt; 
&gt; Shawn.

&gt; I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!

Well I vote for the 70's bus.  3 cheers for those high prices you've noticed 
around here though.  They were the reason for my excellent settlement from 
ICBC.

The reason for my vote is (as you said) the funkiness and the feeling when 
driving.

I might have a couple phone numbers for you to try if you haven't found them 
yet (like an orange 75) although they are on the mainland (are you willing to 
buy over here -- there are 2 or 3 of us list members who might be persuaded to 
give them a quick look for you so you don't come over to look at something 
that is a complete piece of $%^_at_# -- that of course would call for a beer at 
Fogg 'n Suds or something when you make the big purchase).  

How much rust are you willing to put up with, what about engine conditions?  
I'll keep my eyes open for you.

But you can find them, Lief was mint (as in mint condition, not just green) and 
I got him for $3900.
