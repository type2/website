&gt;Hi Gang,
&gt;I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3 years
&gt;now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like to
&gt;stop.
&gt;I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier was 
&gt;interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of network
&gt;resources and $$.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By the end of this month, I will be turning it off.  Anyone interested in
&gt;taking on this job in any way is welcome to it.

Wow!  Well here is a milestone and closing of an era.  Thank you so much
Gerry for the generous work you've done in maintaining the list.  I hope
it doesn't mean you're going away from the list though??  

Of course, I'll kick in some $$$ for Ron's effort to keep the list going.
I'm not as active as I used to be, but I know I owe it to the list.

Thanks again Gerry,

Hmmm..... I guess we won't be 'Gerry's Kids' anymore, eh?  ;)

Cheers!

Steven
