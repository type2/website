&gt;&gt;Does anyone know of replacement covers to match my plaid 78 Westy seats? They
&gt;&gt;are the usual limegreen color etc. I would like to restore it as close as
&gt;&gt;possible to the originals.
&gt;&gt;Regards,
&gt;&gt;C.

I refaced my volvo 264 seats myself and  it turned out great. I digged out
my wife's sewing machine and put a larger needle on it and it worked. I believe
the sewing machine was actuly used the first time after it was purchased many
years ago. The original worn cloth is the perfect pattern for a new set of
cover.
