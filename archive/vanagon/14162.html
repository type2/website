So Jay Tucker says:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Do you know how to fix this problem in a '71 bus. I'm having the same 
&gt; symptoms. stalling after long periods of driving and hesitation when 
&gt; doing in town driving with a lot of stop and go movement.
&gt; 	Any advice would be helpful. 
&gt; 			Thanks 

I'm sorry, this was so funny to me, but I can't help it.  Jay, you
have no fuel injection, so there's no way it would be related unless
the problem is eventually traced to a basic component e.g. the distributor
or the ignition wires.  You're problem is more likely a vapor lock 
problem, bad fuel pump or bad gas.
