Subject:       ratty idle, part 2

and MORE from the archives :)  

&gt; Subject:       cleaning up that ratty idle
&gt; 
&gt; Mike P. wrote asking us for help in getting the rats out of his
&gt; engine:
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my fix that worked on my '85, I'd posted this earlier but I
&gt; didn't keep a copy and I'm don' feel up to an archive search this
&gt; early in the am.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Clean all engine grounds, ie the main one on the left side of the
&gt; block but check others.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Switch to the expensive-but-worth-it 3prong spark plugs
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Replace your plug wires.  NAPA has a nice set for around $60-80.
&gt; I hate the quality of their water-pumps but their wires for the
&gt; vanagon are nice.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Clean your fuel injectors with a fuel injection cleaner system
&gt; that taps into the fuel rail... NOT one of those cans of mystery
&gt; cleaners you add to your gas.  Well you can use those (Techron is
&gt; probably the best) but don't expect miracles.  I'll try to post a
&gt; note later on the fuel injection cleaner system I made.  Essentially
&gt; it uses a LARGE can of 3M brand EFI cleaner and has the engine
&gt; literally run off this can until it is empty.  Cool stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; These mods changed my '85 from an embarassing ratty idle to a smooth
&gt; hum and I don't have the compression you do.
