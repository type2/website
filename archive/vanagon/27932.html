Subject: Too much ignition advance ??


Have any of you ever noticed your timing advance too much at higher rpms ?

I have a stock centrifugal/vacuum advance distributor on my 2.0 l FI 
engine, and the advance is 10-20 degrees higher (as measured with timing 
light) than the specification range for higher rpm's in the service manual.

Are my centrifugal weights loose or what ?  Could this be the cause of my 
occaisonal misfires at cruising speeds ?

If I need to replace my distributor, should i plug the vacuum and install 
a 009 distributor and, perhaps, one of those electronic ignitions ???

Thanks for any comments.
