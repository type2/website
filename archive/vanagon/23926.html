House was in nice location but career drunk let 70 (seventy) cats take over
the house. Lived with it for ten years. Some died in the attic and behind
the hot water tank etc. He left them there. Walls looked like someone hit em
with spray GUNK etc. Architects say it would take $50k just to do a
bandaid/elastoplast to the house. I like cats to a point but I think not!
Besides there was no garage!
