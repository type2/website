&gt; &gt; ==============
&gt; &gt; Saw your Sig. line above - is that on the original engine!?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My plain diesel vanagon got 112K when blowby became excessive and started
&gt; &gt; forcing crankcase oil out the oil filler tube - what a mess!.  I now have
&gt; &gt; about 45 K on a GEX long block.

&gt; 
&gt; Harvey,
&gt; 
&gt;         No, I made it to about 132k and finally had a head give up the
&gt; ghost.  Frankly, the blowby on my engine was getting insane too. (The
&gt; airbox would &quot;whistle&quot; from the crankcase gas when cold) But incredibly,
&gt; the thing still ran great, until the head problem.  Even though I know
&gt; my way around these engines, I don't have the time to do full rebuilds
&gt; any longer.  So I paid a good mechanic on the side to plop a new head on
&gt; the engine, hone, re-ring, and put new bearings and a clutch/pressure
&gt; plate/and new CVs all-around.  Cost about $1100 and I love the van even
&gt; more.  I've always been amazed how well a re-ringed VW diesel will run.
&gt; (Even when you can &quot;slop&quot; the pistons back and forth in the cylinder
&gt; bore)  I figure that considering the diesel is pretty much wound out
&gt; most of the time in a Vanagon, 112-132,000 miles is probably the
&gt; equivalent of 250,000 &quot;Rabbit or Dasher&quot; miles.  That Vanagon has just
&gt; 48 hp whether it needs it or not. ;-) If I make it to 190-200k on this
&gt; rebuild, I'll be very satisfied.
