Hello Everyone.  Well, we survived our month long vacation quite 
well.  We spent 3 weeks in the Canadian Rockies.  Out of 21 days, we 
had 7 or 8 straight days of gorgeous weather, and the rest was a mix 
of almost everything else.  We did get some hiking in, though.  A lot 
of trails were closed due to grizzly activity, so some of our hikes 
were altered.  Even had a black bear encounter coming out of the 
bathroom in Jasper.  The bear and I spotted eachother at the same 
time, and we both took off in opposite directions!  Hmm...!  We 
encountered snow on our last in Jasper before returning home to 
Vancouver, BC with temperatures just below freezing.  Lucky we had 
our little heater with us.

Last week we were in the Okanagan, and enjoyed 24 C weather all week.  
Fabulous stuff!  Loaded up with our winter stock of wine from all the 
wineries in the area :)  

The van was great with no problems to report. 

Glad to be back!
Harry.
