So Tobin Copley says:
&gt; 
&gt; This morning I picked up the Eurovan/Winnibago camper Volkswagen of Canada
&gt; is loaning Ron Lussier for the Inuvik trip.  It's prepped as a press
&gt; vehicle, and is fully decked out with propane fridge, furnace, and (yes,
&gt; Martha) even a shower.

Tobin,

So how did Ron manage to swing this 'free' Eurovan/Winnebago from VW?
What a treat!  Not only does he get to drive the livin' tar..... er...
experiment with this beast, but he saves alot of wear and tear on is
'90 Westy.  Lucky bum.....  :)
