Subject: '79 Bus emissions controller

I purchased a '79 Bus a while back at a bargain rate -- $200 -- because the
dealer said the emissions control computer (the &quot;black box&quot; near the engine)
was kaput. I figured this was a steal of a deal -- but I've had the dang bus
at my local mechanic now for nearly EIGHT WEEKS. . .this is getting very
annoying. I've heard a &quot;new&quot; computer can cost over $600, and the mechanic
is searching local junkyards to find a used one cheap. This is probably
what's taking so long.

A couple of questions arise out of this little dilemma:
1. Is 8 weeks a reasonable time for a Bus to be tied up at a mechanic? (It's
a VW specialist, but not very large.) Should I be getting antsy?
2. Is there any cheap way out of a problem with the emissions computer on
this van (It's  California model, if that makes any difference.)  I've heard
that in worse-case scenarios, one can remove all the computer-ignition junk
totally and stick on a couple of carbuerators. The negative, I'm told, is a
loss of performance, plus the late engines were simply not designed for
carbs. Is the switch worth it? Will I have problems with emissions if I
switch to carbs?

In short -- is there hope for my &quot;bargain&quot; Bus?
