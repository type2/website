     Scott-
     
     I'm no plumber, but I can assure you that it is not necessary, and 
     perhaps even unwise to put plumber's (teflon) tape on the compression 
     fittings of the propane line.
     
     The sealing surface is not the threads, but rather the thin &quot;bead&quot; 
     where the copper pipe itself mates up to the male fitting coming out 
     of the fridge.  If this seal is not being made, the teflon tape will 
     only mask the problem, and maybe not permanently.
     
     Another problem is that the tape itself, especially if applied by the 
     unknowing (let's see...if one turn of tape is good, then three or four 
     must be great, right?).  In this case, the tape may actually prevent 
     the line from seating and thereby sealing properly.
     
     Finally, with teflon being so slippery, it may actually be possible to 
     overtighten and even fracture the fittings.
     
     I say, best to not try and improve on the factory procedure in this 
     case.
