Subject: Re: 71 Bus Front Engine Tin Question


I had the same problem when I put the '72KG motor in the '70Kombi.  My 
first solution was to hack the old '70 front engine tin to fit the oil 
cooler air intake.  In retrospect, this was not a bad approach, I just 
had very primitive tools at the time; with proper metal-cutting tools 
this approach, I believe, would have worked.

I did find the front tin from a '71 Bus at the local yard, but it was a 
real challenge to find, and I couldn't afford any sano-bitchen radical 
t&amp;a zircon-encrusted chrome tin from a custom shop.  

Good Luck!!
