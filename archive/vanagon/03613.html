Subject: '72 Starting Problem

And now the conclusion....

('72 911 won't start)

I was staring at the rotor on my desk here at work yesterday, while waiting
for my SO to get me a new one, when I realized that the rev-limiter's 
demise should not be causing the car to not run.  The juice flows from the
top of the cap (coil wire) thru the rotor and to the indiviual cylinders,
and there was no break in that circuit - the rev-limiter does not break
the circuit - it GROUNDS it, and thus eliminating spark.

I therefore reasoned that something ELSE must be keeping it from starting...

I grabbed a flashlight and went back out to look at it. Sure enough, the
spring had attached itself to the points!  I fished it out and a couple of
little pieces of plastic, put the rotor back in and VROOM!

Well, I saved myself $35, but I'll spend it anyway 'cause I do like to
have the rev-limiter.  At least i wasn't stranded at work any more!

Thanks again for the suggestions

Thom
