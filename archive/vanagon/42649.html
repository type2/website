Subject: seats for '74 camper

Greetings all.

I am looking to replace the low back seats in my '74 camper with something
that has a higher back and headrests.  I understand there are several
designs available from the Westfalia years around this time.

I require seats without the swivel mechanism, as my passenger seat is
stationary, since I have the divider behind this seat.

I am in the process of determining if a set that Ron Salmon has might be
shippable without breaking the bank to get them from Penn. accross the
border, and up into Northern Ontario (Canada).

In the event that the shipping is too much, I will be looking for a source
in Canada where I might find a used pair. Can anyone help me out with
this??


Thanks,
