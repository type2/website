&gt;Let me introduce myself (a few may know me, but most not). I'm Tom
&gt;Brouillette in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I wear a couple of different
&gt;VW &quot;hats&quot;: First, I edit a newsletter for owners an admirers of vintage
&gt;VW buses (kombis, campers, etc.) for a club called NEATO. The newsletter
&gt;is &quot;Old Bus Review,&quot; and I'd be glad to mail anyone a sample copy, via
&gt;regular post.

well, why not? send me one and i'll buy a subscription for me and Gerry. ;)

&gt;I also have a business here in New Mexico renting Vanagon Westfalias to
&gt;the public (usually tourists from out-of-state).Here, too, I would be
&gt;glad to send info to anyone about rates, etc.

if you'll send me a rate info sheet, i'll put it out in the gopher archives
so we can all retrieve it. i don't think anybody will mind ... it's not really
like you're &quot;advertising&quot; on the internet. besides, we've already had a couple
of folks want to know about camper rental companies last summer.

&gt;So. . . I manage a small fleet of campers, but the apple of my eye is my
&gt;'53 Deluxe.

ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! you split-windows are gonna
kill me!! now, i've got to redo my Weakly Stats program!! :) but just for
the sake of accuracy, is it a 53 Deluxe Camper?? or just a 21/23 window
Samba?

&gt;I'm happy to be signed on to this raging torrent of VW Type 2 mania!

:P  he don't know us verry well, do he? :)

&gt;P.S. A friend of mine has an '87 Synchro Westfalia for sale here.

can you describe it? it's not very likely that my bank will give me any more
credit to buy more buses, but i can always dream. especially if it is blue.

p.s. welcome to the funny farm. ;)

&gt;Thanks much!
