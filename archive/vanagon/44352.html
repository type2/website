Hi

I'm having trouble finding a relatively cheap electro magnetic cut off 
valve (central idle system; Haynes page 54, item 60) for the Solex PDSIT 
34 2/3 carburettor.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

I would also like to get hold of two idle mixture enrichment (Haynes 
page 54, item 61) although this is not as crucial as the above part.

I live in Sweden, however the part here at VW is over £100!?!?

Best,
Ian
