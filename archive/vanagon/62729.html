&gt;&lt;&lt; Do they go around the end piece of the crank, behind the oil seal? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yessir, they do!
&gt;
&gt;And don't forget to replace the seal INSIDE the cup in the flywheel and to
&gt;put a wee smear of Moly grease in the input shaft pilot bearing. 
&gt;
&gt;If you don't have the contraption to *measure the end play* once you have
&gt;bolted up the flywheel don't bolt up the clutch until you've rented (or taken
&gt;the engine to someone who has) one of these. Too much or too little endplay
&gt;will ruin the mainshaft bearings thrust faces in short order. You will change
&gt;one of the shims if the end play is wrong.


     A couple of questions.  The machine shop that cleaned the case and 
installed new bearings also installed the rear main seal.  I've checked 
the end play with the seal in and it is within spec.  Do I need to pull 
the seal and check the endplay without it?
