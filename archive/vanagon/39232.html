Subject: Clutch &amp; Oil Seal 81' Van.

This week I am going to put in a new clutch, plate &amp; bearing. I am 
almost sure the through-out bearing has gone bad because I found 
metal up in the fly wheel when I pulled the starter. The clutch seems 
to work but periodically there is a whining sound when I switch gears 
and it is hard to get in gear. In neutral it sometimes whines, it is the
 worse in reverse. But my 
other problem is when I last drove the Van after I stopped about a 
pint of oil started dripping out (fast) near the rear seal. Do you 
think something could have gotten to the seal? Also is the Rear Seal 
for a 2 liter the same as the seal for a 1600cc &quot;bug&quot; engine?  I have 
allready ordered the clutch kit and need to find the seal locally or 
have it over-night. 
Any suggestions or other diagnoses appreciated.                       
Thanks,
Charles F. Webb
