Subject: Easy CV repacking

Hello all.  I thought I would pass along something I tried recently.  
This was inspired by some unremembered person who did something 
similar on a race buggy that needed the cv's repacked after each race.

Basically, they would bolt a plate on either side of the cv.  One of 
the plates had a grease nipple on it.  This allowed them to pack the 
cv full of grease and make the rest of the procedure a bit easier.

I took this one step further.  I went down to the local hardware store
and bought an electrical block off plate.  This thing is a little 
bigger than 4&quot; square and thick enough to be very sturdy.  This same 
hardware store had a small section of auto parts so I bought a grease 
nipple and a nut that would fit the back of it.  This might be easy 
or hard to find.  The metric fittings had fine threads and they didn't
have nuts for those, so I ended up with one that had pipe threads.  
They had a nut for that.  Total cost for these three pieces was less 
than $2.

Back home.  Lay the cv over the plate and mark where the holes 
line up.  I only drilled three of the holes but you could drill all 
six to be extra sure.  Next, figure out where you want the grease 
nipple to go.  I placed it so it would line up between two of the 
balls and just outside of the center part of the cage.  If the threads
on the grease nipple are long you will want to be sure that it won't 
gouge the cv in some way.  I had to extend the cv out so this wouldn't
happen when the plate was bolted down.  Now, drill the hole and bolt 
on the nipple.

Install the clamp, boot and cv as you would normally.  Using the 
cv bolts, bolt the plate to the outside of the cv.  The threads are 
the same as most of the 13mm nuts on VWs.  I found plenty in my used 
nut jar.  Bolt the thing together.  Pay attention to the placement of 
the nipple and make sure it isn't gouging the cv somewhere.

The clamp at the small end of the cv hasn't been tightened yet.  I 
shoved a small screwdriver under there (don't tear the boot doing 
this) to let air out as I pumped in the grease.  Also, grease will 
come out of there when it is full.  I squeezed the grease from 
the boot back into the cv as I went along.  You will get the idea.  
Use your favorite cv grease.  I used Valvoline Moly EP.

After the boot and cv are full you can unbolt the plate and wipe any 
excess from the outside face of the cv and tighten the clamp on the 
small end.  Ready to install.  With the cv nice and packed it will 
not move around when you are installing it.  I would describe the 
whole procedure as almost clean.  Much nicer than the three previous 
times I have done this on other cars.

The only caution I think of off hand is to be careful not to over do 
it with the grease.  Most people now say to use about 6 ounces.  
This is roughly twice what VW said to use.

Let me know what you think!

Jim
