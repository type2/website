Oooh, goody..how to figger out height (or rolling diameter as Al mentions) from 
the tire specs...this is fun!

Given the two sizes,205/70 and 195/75....

The first number is the tread width in Millimeters. The second number is the 
&quot;aspect ratio&quot;, which is derived as the percentage of height the sidewall has in 
relation to the tread width.

For the 205/70, the width is 205mm and the sidewall height is 70% of 205mm, or 
143.5mm. For the metric impaired, that would be 5.64&quot;. So, add (2 x 5.64) to the 
rim diameter to get total height.

Similarly, the 195/75 is 195mm wide and the sidewall height is 75% of 195mm, 
which is 146.25mm, or 5.75&quot;. In this case, add (2 x 5.75) to the rim diameter to 
get the total height.

Looks like the two are pretty close in height.

Just my $.02 worth...

My local costco has this tire 2ply sidewall, 4ply tread, C rated, max pressure
50PSI at ~60$ each.  

The questions for net.vw.wisdom are:

1.  ennybody running these shoes?  How do you like em and on what bus are they?

2.  What would the rolling diameter difference be between 205/70 MXL$$$ and 
    195x75.  

The intended use is a mostly on road syncro westie.

Derek?, Harry?, Syncrohead? whats the poop?

It is my understanding that the 205/70 MXL reinforced is NLA, BTW.
