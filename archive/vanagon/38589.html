Subject: Looking for '71 Crew Cab?

Hi All,

I'm still looking for a '68-'71 Crew Cab somewhere here on the west 
coast. I was looking at a particular site http://vision.traderonline_dot_com 
and found a '71 Crew Cab.

1971 VOLKSWAGEN CREW CAB PICKUP, rare, partially restored, daily driver, 
complete w/Bows canvass for rear, all repair parts available from after 
market, $3000 XXX-XXX-XXXX STAFFORD, VA

If you're interested, you'll need a credit card to get the phone number. 
It seems this particular site charges for it. It's only a buck, so it's 
not too bad.

If anyone runs across something for me on this side of the country, 
please let me know.

Happy Friday all,

Bren
