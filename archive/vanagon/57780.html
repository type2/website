Subject: 1980 autotranny

i posted this question to the type2 list wiht no response, thought i'd try
here...

i am wondering what years the autotransmission was common regarding an 80
vanagon.  i/e if someone put an older transmission in the van i now own,
is there a chance that the shaft size is different.

thanks,

Stephen White
