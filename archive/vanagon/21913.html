Subject: Philly Area Gathering #2????


Any of the &quot;Phirst Philly Crew&quot; and/or the rest the Northeast
Contingent of the Vanagon list interested in perhaps having a
gathering at the Woodstock VW Reunion this Sept 9 &amp; 10?

There are a couple of other possibilities...

Aug 27 - Ct Bug-A-Fair 4 - Terryville CT...as the listing in the
Comming Events section of the LiMBO TRANSPORTER said &quot;a big
show that needs more busses&quot;...

Sept 30 - Transporterfest - Brookfield Orchard, Brookfield, MA


Well????

Ric
