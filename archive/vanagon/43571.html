&gt;Howdy volks, this summer is the summer of maggies restoration (slow but sure).
&gt;
&gt;The current problem:  a grinding sort of noise at idle.  It's a real low
&gt;key noise, and has an element of randomness to it, it sort of sounds like
&gt;heavy metal pieces grinding and clanking.  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;The usual info:
&gt;
&gt;76 westy, 2000cc, AFC, auto...
&gt;
Could be the alternator.  You might try removing the belt temporarily and
seeing if that gets rid of the noise.
