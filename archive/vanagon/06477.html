That's what I thought too. In our case, when we need some heat it is 
either blowing hard and/or raining. That rules out using the top vent and 
when you open much more it either gets wet and/or (damn, I like that) 
cold - quick. 
I would also like to know of anyone that has installed on in a Westy to 
know where it went and how it is vented.
