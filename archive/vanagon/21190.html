How to Replace the Fuel Valve Cable

by Thom Fitzpatrick

On busses to about 63 or so, there was a pull cable located in front
of the seat to operate the reserve fuel valve.  This valve is a work
around for not having a gas tank.

The way the valve works is thus:  2 pickup tubes extend into the tank,
a long one and a short one, with about 1 1/2&quot; between them.  With
the valve in the &quot;normal&quot; position, the fuel comes out of the long tube.
When your bus starts sputtering and runs out of gas, you pull the lever,
and gas is pulled out of the short tube.

If the valve is not in the _exact_ right position, then no gas will flow.
This is a rudimentary anti-theft measure.

The cable is similar to a bike brake cable, with the cable routed the
a wound, flexible tube.  The cable is routed under the bus, tied to the
clutch cable tube for most of the way.  It is attached to the valve
by a barrel clamp justlike the one that holds the throttle cable to 
the carb or the heater cables to the heater boxes.

If the cable is jammed, or needs to be takenout for what ever reason,
this is how ya do it:

Remove the front seat.

In the empty area under the seat, reach up to where the cable goes to the
front of the bus, and you'll find a knurled screw that holds the cable
to the bulkhead.

Now go underneath, and remove the cable from the valve, then from the 
cable support right by the valve.  Then loosen all the ties that hold the
cable all the way to the fron (FIF) of the bus.  Pull the cable back thru
each one of them until you get to the front cross member.

Now go into the cab, and pull the cable all the way out.

My cable was frozen up, so I used some Liquid Wrench (TM) and Elbow Grease (TM)
to get it free.  

Putting it back in is pretty straightforward.
back to the front.

The same procedure can be applied to the choke cable, if you have one.

New cables (choke and reserve valve) are available from 
Wolfsburg West for about $15.
