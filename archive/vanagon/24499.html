Just got back from surfing.  Execellent waves!  Almost head high this AM,
getting smaller and closer to the beach as the tide came in.

Used about 6 gallons of gas to get there.  Still have to do the math to
see if thats good or not.  Averaged 70 PH down there, tho.

Passed the Muir dipstick test when I got to the beach

When I got back, I stuck the meat thermometer in the oil hole, unloaded
some stuff, came back and checked.  GASP!  The thermo had _wrapped_ around
past 200 and came to rest at 80!  What!?  Yikes!  Let it cool a bit,
and then looked at the thermo.  At ambient temp (80 something) it real 160!
D'oh!  Time for a new thermometer!
