&lt;&lt; Someone posted up a mention of an undercoating that is actually a roof
 patching compound, water based. I lost the message  &gt;&gt;

The product is called &quot;Kool Patch&quot;, made by a company called Kool Seal, &quot;The
Quality Leader in Roof Coating Products&quot;. Offices in Twinsburg OH, 44087;
Clearwater, FL, 34622; and N. Las Vegas Nevada, 89031. I buy it at
Hechinger's a Mega-hardware store. Home Depot, Lowes, Builder's Empoium, or
whatever Mega-harware store you have nearby would probably have it, or call
Kool Seal.

For those who were seeking &quot;Waxoil&quot;, the waxy rustproofing that VW sprayed in
to all the cracks and crevices, I have found it. 3M markets this product in
an aerosol spray (which dries to a beige, water-proof waxy goo). It is called
&quot;Rust Preventative&quot; and comes in a white and tan can for about $13.00 a can,
which held enough to do everything I could think of on Suzy's bus. I bought
it at a body-shop-supply store called Mattos, in Annandale, VA. Other
Auto-body stores that carry 3M products could get it.

Mattos also carries some other neat stuff which I will discuss in my BIG
upcoming &quot;Soundproofing, Insulating and Rustproofing&quot; post. You will be
amazed at how QUIET you can make your VW, but that's another post.

Quiet and rust-free,
