Subject: Business/Pleasure Trip report

Well as I said last week I drove up to Santa Clara (San Jose
area) instead of taking the airplane tickets.  All week was
for business up a Cisco but since monday was a holiday (at
least for UCLA) I wanted to stay up there and check out Napa
Valley and drink some wine!  Well for those who follwed Nor.
Cal. weather, you all know that the entire state of California
north of San Francisco washed into the ocean and is no longer
there.

So I chose instead to head towards Santa Cruz.  This I did by
taking highway 9 from Los Gatos to Santa Cruz (approx 35 miles).
This road weaves through pine covered mountains, is slow driving
at least in a Vanagon, but a highly recommended path IMHO.  About
3/4's of the way there is a small town called Redwood.  They had
a microbrewery and since I'm on a mission from God to try all beers
in the world I had to stop.  Good call on my part since of course
it was raining.

After Santa Cruz I headed to Monterey for Sat. night, Sunday, and
Sun. night.  Been there, done that before so I just kicked around
but anyone else on a R/T in the area should check out sites.

Sunday I went into Carmel.  Just kicked around some more before
heading down the highway for the eight hour trip home.  From
Carmel (highway 1) to highway 101 I took a longcut called
highway G16.  What a cool road!  The map made it look like it was
a fairly good road.  But after about 15 miles it turns into this
less than two lane, unstriped, winding road that cuts through cattle
farms.  Saw some of the greenest hills I've ever seen.  Another
recommended sidetrack IMHO.  From there I headed down 101 to Orange
County (for those who don't know it's about half way between Los
Angeles and San Diego).

Total miles = 1,134 (nothing like a paid road trip!).
