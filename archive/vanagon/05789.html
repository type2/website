Subject: Re: Camper/ pop top conversion

Yes, the country homes conversion does pop straight up.  They
charge about $3K to put this in from scratch, as I recall.  I
do think that they have a label or possibly individual letter
decals which affix to either the front or rear end of the
pop-top, with their names on it.  There is nothing over
the space the westy luggage rack usually occupies, so
one is free to use that as  space for a sunroof.
