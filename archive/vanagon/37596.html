&gt;&gt; Can't the military's many years of experience be used to come up with a
&gt;&gt; high powered pellet gun that can shoot out those lights with the touch of
&gt;&gt; a button?  When I am driving I don't have time to aim manually so it 
would
&gt;&gt; have to be all automatic.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah! YEAH!!!  And while we're at it, get it to aim for the rear tires of
&gt;those slow-pokes who hog the fast lane in front of you!

And then there's my own personal favorite:

Aim it rearward, at the radiators of those who tailgate you in the slow
lane. They would benefit from some contemplative time sitting by the
side of the road enveloped in a cloud of steam, waiting for the tow truck.
