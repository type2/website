Jim,
I have the latest catalog from Kennedy Engineered Products dated 6/96.
They stated that they were working up a kit for the 2.2L Suby, &quot;which we
hope to have smog legal in California in a couple months.&quot; Little
mention was made of what would be included in the kit, but they mention
a custom air duct which would allow the engine to be mounted in the
stock position without modifying the engine compartment. Also mentioned
were special exhaust pipes that flow better than stock, do not cut
ground clearance, and bolt to the original cat and muffler or to their
new approved cat and muffler. I have no more info on the kit, at least
until I call them on Monday. If you're interested, call them at
805-272-1147, or I can forward more information next week. I had plans
for swapping a Suby 6 into my Westagon, but after noting that the 2.2L
comes in a turbo version with 160HP _at_ 181ft.lbs. of torque, and KEP had
a kit for it, I quickly changed my mind. The standard 2.2 ain't so bad,
either, with 130HP _at_ 137ft.lbs. Hopes this helps.
Larry
