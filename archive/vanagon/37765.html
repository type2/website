Subject: difficult task

I think I'm interested in selling my 86 Westy syncro. Not camping 
anymore - what is a realistic price to ask?  I bought it new and 
have all the repair records. Just replaced the heads, muffler and a 
a wheel bearing.  Small rust in seams, noisy sink console and small 
dent in nose from a flying 2x4, bra covers it. It has air, stereo 
and all the other standards.  Sherwin
