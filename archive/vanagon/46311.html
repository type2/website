Subject: I found out what that smell was

I had posted about a sulfurous smell coming into the cab via the heater.
Went off for the fourth to Madison, WI, pulled over in Eau Claire to relieve
myself and the bus wouldn't turn over! Luckily there were some folks in a
Westy that were only too happy to push me. The bus started off immediately
and I went off to a friend's house to take care of it.

I called the local vw guy the morning of the fourth (he just happened to be
in) and I dropped the bus off before leaving for Mad-town. He suggested the
starter or a solenoid problem, but he'd deal with it on Monday and to call
back then (yipee! I just bought myself an extra day of vacation).

So I get back, call Craig, and he can't find the problem. Could it be the
battery? Nope, just got a new one. Well, I'll keep lookin'. Turns out it was
the voltage regulator, cranking up to 18v. Toasted my battery! Back home now
and things look good. Told Craig about the vanagon list and others, and I'll
be going back to set him up on email, so he can talk to us (and whittle my
bill down a bit).

Incidentally, Craig has a restored '71 beetle fully restored (not stock),
whale tail, and a porsche engine he's got up for sale at $9,000. Beautiful.
His number is 715-723-3748 if you're interested.

Back to the folks in the Westy: Had my first chance to extend the hand of vw
siblinghood/friendship. They had broken down after leaving Further and ended
up in Eau Claire. Gave them Craig's number and a place to camp. Saw them
later at the bar (The Joynt, Eau Claire, if any one is interested), where we
talked for hours. Nice folks from S. Carolina. If you see Pam and DeWitt,
their 3 dogs and two friends, say hi.

Joel: got the manual. Thanks. Check will be in the mail today!
