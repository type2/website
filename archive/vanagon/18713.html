Subject: Blue Ridge Rally

          Busses on the Blue Ridge rally was great!!!  This is not an
          official report or anything just an observation by an
          attendee.  I can't imagine a better event or place or
          weather, even.  Met a great bunch of people, scored some
          parts, came within 100 miles of longest distance award, met
          &quot;captain&quot; jim kirk and his lovely kate and their two cats
          &quot;twist&quot; and &quot;shout&quot; , met and had a wonderful time with dave
          easterwood and got to see his collection, wow!  i think we
          had close to 30 splitties up there.  We created quite a
          traffic nuisance on the parkway.  Let's hear something
          offical-like from you, Dave.  Oh yeah, the mouse that
          crawled into our bus friday night still lives there, in the
          nosepiece.  Lea is trying to coax him out with a live trap
          so we can release him.  I just hope he doesn't munch on my
          wiring.    Ray
