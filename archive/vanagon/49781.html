Subject: Re: Hd Gasket Leak '85

I agree. There's lots of great info via the archives and list members. 
I did it about a month ago having absolutely no prior experience and 
using info from these sources. Took me a while and chewed my hands up 
pretty good, but it costs me about 1/4 of bids I recieved. The 
knowledge learned was also invaluable. Good luck!

&gt;	Have you given any thought to doing it yourself. I know it sounds
&gt;intimidating but as my neighbor told me before I did my first one 
&gt;&quot;Aint nutin to eet&quot;. Do you know which side is leaking? The passenger 
&gt;side is a tad easier to fix. Get a manual, a head gasket repair kit 
&gt;and a case of beer( to celebrate with of course).
