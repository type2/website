Subject: Another Syncro For Sale


	I passed this one at a parking lot at my workplace:

	 '87 Westfalia Syncro 4x4, w/ Lockable Rear Diff.
	  A/C, Aux batt
	  $8500

	Tim Axelrod (work) 510 423 1736
		    (home) 408 897 3248
		     
 	Oh...it has 46375 miles in the odometer. It looks in decent 
	shape with on sheetmetal damage other than the odd bush scratch
	and a dent in the rear bumper. It was dirty and looks like it 
	has spent some time on dirt roads.
	
	The interior seemed in decent shape.

	It's silver...
