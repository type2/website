Subject: Fridge problems...

Howdy!

I tried to get the fridge started yesterday for my trip to Yosemite, and it
wouldn't start!  I pumped and pumped, and then pressed the 'starter' button.
It would seem to start briefly, but then the 'pilot light' would start to
flash again.  There is propane in the tank... the stove works fine.

Any ideas?

Ron
