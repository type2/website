&gt; That's what I thought.  By the way,  gutting the CAT will decrease

&gt;  If VAN is running properly, vehicle will still pass most emission

&gt; needs info on Emissions, I have written some articles that expalins the test
&gt; purposes, (GROSS POLLUTERS).  I can E-Mail them to you.  Also, deliberately
&gt; gutting the CAT is a FEDERAL Offense.  Find a good used one!

I agree with this, that's why I felt so bad doing it (I'll deny it if
there's any feds on the list).

BUT, in California (at least), it is illegal to sell a used CAT (you have
to go to Nevada, and there you can only rent them...sorry, couldn't
resist).  Like I said about my 80 Westy, you can save some money (in my
case almost 600 bucks at the time) on the new one by having the muffler
shop weld in a &quot;generic&quot; one.  Now wait a minute, I don't mean weld it in
so you can't get the exhaust off the head later.

What I did was:
(1) have the guy (let's say, Bob, for example) make sure that the exhaust
system is all tight. Not hangy downey.

(2) Have Bob cut the old converter off by LEAVING THE FLANGES AT THE ENDS
bolted to the rest of the exhaust system.

(3) Have Bob cut the ends of the new converter (the one I bought was long
enough to do this) so that it fits between the old CAT's flanges.

(4) Have Bob weld the new converter to the old CAT's flanges.  Make sure
that when he does so, if it's one of those flattish things (rather than
round) that it's oriented so that it doesn't get in the way of removing the
valve cover (since the CAT on the 80 was parallel to the head on the
driver's side;  I don't know if they all were so STUPIDLY designed).  If
Bob is worried about welding so close to the engine (they seldom are, for
some reason), ask him to tack weld them on, unbolt the beast, and finish
the job on the bench.

...and VOILA...

You have a &quot;new&quot; converter that you can unbolt to dismantle the engine
later, if you need.  Mine cost me about 180 bucks, installed.  That was
around 1991.
