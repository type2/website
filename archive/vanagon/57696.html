Check the ground connection for the headlights.  Believe it or not, they 
brought the headlight ground back to the dash. Remove the fuse box and check 
the grounds just above to the left,(those clusters).  Both headlight grounds 
are on the same connector.  You may see the insulation starting to burn off.  
I separate the headlights to two separate connections and problem won't happen 
again.  You may also want to actually ground the lights right near them.

Here's the problem:

I've got a 1980 Vanagon L Camper.  All of a sudden the headlights won't 
turn on.  

I checked all the fuses too.  The brake lights will come on, but when I 
turn it all the way down for the headlights, the red &quot;Brights&quot; light 
comes on, and no headlights.

Then when I turn on a turn signal, the lights flash between the green 
turnsignal and the brights light, much as it does with the hazards on.  
But on the outside the turn signal does work.

The hazards work too.

Any suggestions?

thanks,  Kyle
