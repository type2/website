COMMENT

As people accessorize their buses (high wattage stereos, aux. lighting, CB's, high output 
headlights, ..., etc.) it might be prudent to run a separate heavy gauge lead from the 
battery for this things, as Ken Lewis suggested is a previous posting today.

In additional, I would suggest adding an auxiliary fuse box just for this line and then run 
these items through this box.  Also, be liberal in using relays to activate these items.

This will result in better accessory performance and reliability.  It will also make 
troubleshooting mush easier down the road.
