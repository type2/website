Subject: some pictures from BTBW last month

I finally got around to &quot;processing&quot; the images from Bear Trax and Bee's
Wax last month - and put a few of them up at:

http://www.halcyon_dot_com/rickgo/BTBW-Tahuya-97.html

Only a couple of people are recognizable - one of whom is Art showing off
his broken derailleur!

VW people - the obligatory Trek Team EuroVan shot is included.
