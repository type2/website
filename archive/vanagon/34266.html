Subject: anyone seen this kind of bus?

Hi Folks, 
I just had a flashback of my first time driving a VW Bus.
It was a green/white 79 Bus.
It was for sale, that's how i got to drive it.

The weird part about it was the interior.  It had the normal sliding
side door, but then there was a &quot;gate&quot; which swung out so
you could get in.  Then, there was no middle seat, but a ramp leading
up to the metal over the engine.  On the outside, there were thin metal
tubes coming from the front bumper to the windshield.

The owner said everything was stock, except for all the wooden cabinets
he installed.  It all sounds crazy, but my memory isn't that bad.
Is it some kind of delivery truck?
Wadda you think?

Paul
