&gt;&gt; &gt;..so what's gonna happen if April 1st is a Friday..?...
&gt;
&gt;then Joel quipped:
&gt;&gt; God Help Us, One and All ...
&gt;&gt; tinny tim. :)
&gt;
&gt;wasn't *tinny* tim Tom Terrific's younger brother?  or maybe that was
&gt;a different Emily Dickens novel.

no, no ... Tinny Tim is the real name of The Tin Man, from the Whizzer
of Ahs (also known by humans across the world as The Pause that Refreshes).
