Watch out for those bug hubcaps on a Vanagon.  They are cheap and look
good, but on the left front, where the speedo cable sticks out of the hub,
the protruding cable end can cause the hubcap to fall off.  I've lost two
from that position.

&gt; I bought a set of bug hubcaps that fit on my steel rims very well.  Look
&gt; pretty good.  I got the idea from another Vanagon I saw where the owner
&gt; painted the steel rims the same color as the van, put the white sidewall
&gt; facing out and the chrome bug cap on the rim.  Looked really nice.  (I
just
&gt; need to paint my rims and flip my tires and I'll be there....another
project
&gt; to add to the list)
