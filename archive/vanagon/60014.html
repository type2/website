Subject: Re: turbo or supercharger addition?

I haven't worked on turbos, but my last three cars ('85 Daytona, '85
Saab and '90 Eagle Talon) have been turbos.  Basically you're
trading power for longevity.  The cars that come with turbos from
the factory are typically built to take the extra strain of the more
powerful explosion.  The Talon has 93k miles and the engine still
purrs, has good compression, and uses almost no oil.  Turbos are 
often oil-cooled and therefore oil changes at regular intervals 
becomes more critical than in normally aspirated cars (turbos run hot 
and can coke up the oil; dunno if this is the same for 
superchargers).

I would guess that the wasserboxer cooling system is already taxed 
and adding more strain to that is probably a bad idea.

My mostly unqualified $0.02.
