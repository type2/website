&gt; My driver's side door gasket on my 93 EV has separated at
&gt; the top of the door opening.  From looking at it, it appears
&gt; to be two pieces -- an inner and outer piece -- glued
&gt; together to make one assembly.  The outer piece is very
&gt; stretchy and is glued to the inner piece in a stretched
&gt; mode, making it very difficult for me to reglue it, since it
&gt; has come unglued across the entire top.  My initial effrts
&gt; with  Permatex weatehrstrip glue was unsuccessful, as within
&gt; a day, it came undone.  I'm about to try the real thing --
&gt; 3M Weatherstrip glue -- but thought I'd ask if anyone esle
&gt; has had the same problem and has a better idea (other than
&gt; removing the entire door gasket!)
&gt; 
The 3M stuff should work - the trick is to devise a setup to clamp the 
piece in position for a few hours or more. I used 3M glue on the 
joints on my '88 poptop seal, with clamps to hold in place overnight. 
It's gone 3 months now with no signs of coming loose.
