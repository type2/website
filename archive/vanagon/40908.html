&gt;i don't know anything about the struts (good or bad), but i've been pleased
&gt;with the stuff i've ordered from the company in the past. the catalog is
&gt;pretty neat, anyway. ;)

I called them today as I need new hatch struts for my bus. I asked
them for the brand they carry (wanted to make sure I wasn't getting
Suspender Brand after all I have heard about them here) and was told
they are manufacutered by BMW. Went ahead and ordered. Will let
everyone know how things go.
