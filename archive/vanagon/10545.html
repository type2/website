Subject: Re: Collapsing Westy Tents

&gt;&gt;reached that magic 3-gallon (U.S. ;-) limit, then SPLOOSH.  Fortunately,
&gt;&gt;only a couple of those irreplaceable plastic snap-hooks broke (waaah!). 
&gt;
&gt;The manual also sez:
&gt;&quot;In the event of heavy rain, untie one of the loops attaching the tent to
&gt;the frame on each side. This will prevent water from collecting on the roof
&gt;of the tent.&quot;
&gt;

AND.... keep the windows zipped almost shut, or the water runs into the tent 
anyhow!
&gt;

Water build-up in the section between van rain gutter and tent is also a pain.
