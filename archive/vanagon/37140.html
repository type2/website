Subject:       '57 Resoration Preparation

In hopes to one day have the Pioneer in the class with those 
Califonians who demand no less than $16,995 for their 21 window, I've 
a few questions:

The driver-side  engine vent louvers are tweaked and poorly 
'bondoed.'  I'm wondering if anyone has done, or has had done a 
transplant.

I think this will be my only option, unless I can find a body man 
that can really work these things, and make them look right.

So I guess I'm looking for a section of clean louvers (remember this 
is a '57 so it has the lovers going &quot;out&quot;) 

I'm also looking for the chrome stips that go on these things.  Local 
guy says I'll be hard-pressed to get them for anything less than $10 
a strip!  Ack.  That's like $160 for a set!

Has anyone revived a door with screwed up hinges.  My drivers door 
has the infamous sag.  Anyone in particular to talk to when searching 
for a new door?

Next.  Trivia Question of the Day!

Is the passanger door supposed to lock?  Pusing the handle down 
doesn't do anything, and there's no key lock like the rest of the 
doors.  (which I had all re-keyed by a fabulous local locksmith!)
So?


Lastly, and probably most importantly:

Who can I call to order a new canvas/vinyl sunroof cover?  I'll 
probably call today on it since mine self-destructed on the freeway 
last weekend.

Thanks to all!  And Merry Friday!
