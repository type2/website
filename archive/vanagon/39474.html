&gt;What year ?  
1968-1971 It has the front turn signals down low and
&quot;half-moon&quot; air scoops in the rear.

&gt;What color? 
White, hardtop Westfalia camper (no pop-top).

&gt;What size engine? 
If it's stock - 1600cc.

&gt;Is there an aftermarket CO2 recirculation system installed?  
It was removed quite some time ago.

&gt;Really, does anyone know ?
Dead men tell no tales.

Dr. Kevorkian was the subject of a cable tv (A&amp;E) 
program &quot;Biography&quot; last week.  Great show, IMHO.
