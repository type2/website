&gt;well... when *I* was a kid, we were so poor we didn't have any garden
&gt;hoses to use as our pythons.  we had to draw a snake in the dirt and
&gt;sweep it up to move it each time we wanted to chase each other.

well, WE were so poor that we didn't have DIRT!!  we had to walk around on
coal and cinders! and garbage! cause we lived in the garbage dump! the
poor folks' garbage dump, that is ... not the Rich Folks garbage dump!

&gt; notice how Thursdays have become Fridays??  that must mean that
&gt;Monday is really Sunday and i shouldn't have to go to work until
&gt;Tuesday.

all in keeping with the theory of the planet losing spin and slowing down,
and all the horoscope signs are in the wrong place with the calendar and
what used to be April is now May or something like that. we wuz too pore
to have calendars. :)
