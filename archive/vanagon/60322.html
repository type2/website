&gt;        How easy is it to remove that type awning? I've talked with some
&gt;folks who lugged their awning around with them all summer because putting
&gt;it on and taking it off was such a hassle. (I don't recall what kind it
&gt;was.) In a perfect world, I'd only want to have the awning attached to the
&gt;side of the bus when I was going camping or picnicking.
&gt;        Last summer I spotted a rolled-up awning from Carefree of Colorado
&gt;on the side of a Westy in a parking lot. I never got a chance to speak with
&gt;the owner or see it deployed. Anybody have experience with that variety?
&gt;
&gt;        Also, what kind of money are we looking at for either the A&amp;E
&gt;(sounds like a cable TV channel) or Carefree awnings?
&gt;

I have one made by &quot;Carefree of Colorado&quot; on the EV. It's in a carrier that
bolts using large metal plates onto the side of the van. For this, I let
the dealer install it - we're talking 2-3 major holes per each plate!

It works pretty well, and is possible for one person to setup although two
people make it a lot easier. (I'm also 6'4&quot; and have a pretty good reach so
consider this when I say &quot;one person&quot;)

It's a bit tricky the first time you set  it up. You end up with two frames
with perpendicular (X-Y-Z) axes. The X axes join to each other, the Y axes
hit the ground, the Z axes connect back onto the bracket mounts. The result
is a nice
aluminum rectangle holding the fabric taut, with aluminum posts of
adjustable height. There are holes to pin down the posts with stakes but
I've never needed to.

It's really nice in hot &amp; wet weather - but if its wet you occasionally
have to knock the water off.

Also you have to remember that it's made of aluminum - a soft metal and if
you force it bending will occur. (And in case you didn't know, aluminum has
no fatigue limit - bend it very far and it will break.) (My wife started to
bend it before I stopped her during one of the initial setups!)

Cost is not pleasant. Frankly I don't remember exactly, but I think
US$400+- was in the ballpark.

Pictures of the deployed awning are on my web page: start at
