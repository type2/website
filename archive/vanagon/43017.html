Dear Mr. Serger,

Thank you very much for the information, which I am passing to the Vanagon
mailing list, especially for the benefit of our European subscribers.

Among the list's  600+ subscribers are a few parts dealers.  Perhaps one will
be interested in acting as a distributor for your product.

In Friendship,
-Bob
