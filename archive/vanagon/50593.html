I understand, when I was looking for a new vehicle, I almost bought back
my 70 westy.  But I don't have the time to work on a car every day
(that's what it took).  I also wanted heat and A/C.  At the same time, I
thought the Vanagons were ugly (the EV's are worse, they look like
American mini vans).  Once I found my 86 GL, after driving a junk yard
Honda Accord for two years, I realized there was more in common between
the aircooled and water cooled than I thought. 

Work on a Japanese car sometime, you'll come back to VW and appriciate
it.
