Subject: A goat in a Volkswagen junkyard [f]

A goat in a Volkswagen junkyard,
in search of an afternoon meal,
had started with remnants of rubber
and several fragments of steel.
He nibbled a couple of axles,
he gobbled up gauges and gears,
he gnawed on a tangle of wires
and colorful plastic veneers.

He polished off various bearings,
he munched on a mountain of brass,
he bolted a heap of upholstery
and numerous panels of glass.
He put away pistons and pedals,
then followed a fender or two
with most of a standard transmission,
and they aren't easy to chew.

He ate an assortment of sprockets,
he swallowed some springs by the coil,
then washed down his lunch with a gallon
of forty-weight premium oil.
As soon as that goat had digested
the junk he had feasted upon,
he coughed
     and he coughed
          and he coughed
               and he coughed
and he coughed up a new Vanagon.
