Subject: 78' Westy Restoration

Hi folks! I'm restoring a 78 Westfalia Campmobile Deluxe. The job is almost
complete, but I do need the following items in order to have the van like
new.
 
1. Upholstered storage box/trash container between front seats
2. Small removable table in driver's cabin
3. Two knobs for the louver windows 

My Westy is Sahara Beige color (this is for reference). I live in the sunny
island of Puerto Rico and here we have a lot of activities dedicated to VWs
For example in Sept. 3 will be held the 2nd. Encounter of Owners and Lovers
is very colorful and interesting.                                          
If you have any information on the items I need, please reply.
