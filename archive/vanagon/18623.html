Colorado follows the national EPA guidelines.  Note that this is only
true for &quot;Front Range cities&quot; (i.e, Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder,
etc, anything on the East side of the Rockies).

It's pretty easy to pass
the emissions test if your vehicle is running well--they don't check for
original parts or anything.  My '74 Beetle (my pre-Kombi days/daze)
required a 3.0% CO--which it easily met.

Your carburetor could be your
potential downfall--if it's old and burns rich, yours may not pass.

I don't believe non-detergent oil is sold anymore.

JKH--New Mexico (y'know, just South of Colorado) :)
