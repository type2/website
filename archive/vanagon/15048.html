I had the same problem in my '70, and it turned out to be a bad 
starter-battery cable--the cable had corroded out from within the plastic 
sheath, thus invisible.  Replaced it as well as both ground straps.  
Archetypal old-guy mechanic told me the headlights &quot;heated up&quot; the wires, 
allowing for greater conceptual continuity.  (OK, I made that last part 
up, but it did fix it)
