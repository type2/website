Hey now

I just got back from a vacation in Mexico, where I drove a new Bug for
a week...

It had way more power than my '60 Bug, and the seats were really nice.
Same headlamp and hazard switch as my old '86 Jetta.  I had it up to
just over 130kph.  I took some pix of the bug (40,000 pesos) and a new
Combi or two (they have really nice interiors, and only 110,000 pesos!)
If anybody's interested, I can scan 'em and put 'em up on techie (or mail
them to the keepers of assorted Web pages).

It took a while to get used to the experience of every third car being
a Bug or Combi; around NYC and NJ, it's pretty rare to see them, and I
have a keen eye; my head's always turning when I see or hear an aircooled
VW.  But Mexico, now that's civilization, where new Bugs are plentiful
and only about $5500 US.

	TTFN
