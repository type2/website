are the PVC pipes less expensive? I paid $94.00 (from VW) for the short
pipe that comes out of the water pump around the driver side. the long ones
on the underside will need to be replaced soon also, but I am afraid to
even ask how much they are. If they are cheaper, where can I get them?

Thanks,

&gt; My syncro had the metal pipes replaced by the PVC pipes as well. The PVC
pipes
&gt; will not corrode and I believe that is the reason VW used them (it's
documented
&gt; in the Bentley manual)... To date, I have not had a problem...
