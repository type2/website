Subject: Batteries: Optima vs Gp 41...was Re: Group-41 deep cycle
  gel-cel battery -payback

Ron Lussier posted the specs to the Optima a couple of days ago, and the
full article is on his website at:
                                        http://www.vanagon_dot_com/beethoven/ele
ctrical.html

I tried to compare the two lists of specs side by side, but was not able to
interpret fully.   It does seem that the Gp 41 is 1&quot; shorter than the
Optima, so no cutting *might* be required to fit it in under the driver's
seat.  I found the Optima battery online at a couple of places.  Best price
was a plce called desertrat_dot_com in Arizona [800.528.3402], $167.95 including
S/H delivered to CA.

Their website,        http://desertrat_dot_com/optimbat/optima.htm

has a good discussion w/ pictures of the Optima.  The price is actually
$129.99.  Shipping might differ to other places, and we are talking about
46.1 lbs.

Ron's post also had info wrt a trickle-charging system he used.  He
suggested grinding off the top posts on the Optima, but James' suggestion
sounds like a good way to go.

FYI.  I have no idea what might be the relative strengths/weaknesses of the
gel system vs the spiral wound technology.

Either of these could be a big help, and I appreciate everyone's input.  The
timing is great, as I wanted to get some kind of auxiliary battery in place
in the next month, before a 12-day trip I have planned.

Love this list!

&gt;&gt;Its payback time. After getting so much help from everyone, and realizing
&gt;how
&gt;&gt;much dosh I've saved for so many things I didn't go to the dealer for, I'm
&gt;happy
&gt;&gt;to say I have a little something to share back.
&gt;
&gt;I, too, got a lot of info from the list, thanks.
&gt;
&gt;Here is what I came up with.
&gt;
&gt;Optima Deep Cycle Battery (not gel, new spiral wound technology)
&gt;52 amp hours
&gt;700 or 750 cranking amps
&gt;Sealed -- no gases
&gt;Can be charged harder than gels without risk of frying
&gt;Also expensive ($160-$180)
&gt;
&gt;Fits under seat but is a little too tall -- however comes with side and top
&gt;terminals, so I am going to use the side terms and drill holes in the black
&gt;access cover (and carpet) for the top terminals -- the access cover then
&gt;closes.  Top terminals come with plastic caps and will stick up through the
&gt;carpet (but not so high that the driver's seat won't swivel).  They will be
&gt;out of harms way when driving, and if I need to jump-start someone I can just
&gt;slide the seat forward a bit and take off the plastic caps.
&gt;
&gt;People I have talked with think that this new technology is hot, so I guess
&gt;I'll find out.
&gt;
&gt;I could drum up the spec's if anyone's interested.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, I am using a A/B/Both switch instead of making the relay vs isolator
&gt;decision and wiring in an on-board charger that will charge both batteries
&gt;when the van is plugged in.
