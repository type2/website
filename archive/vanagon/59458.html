Kyle,

I too have a parked Vanagon, about 75% of the last two years (look 
for the novelette to be published on the list). 

The first thing I replaced with similar symptons was the fuel pump.  
I do NOT think I needed to.  Even after I repaced it and it still 
wouldn't run right, the VW dealer said I need to replace the fuel 
pump for $320!  &quot;It's making a heck of a racket&quot;  Turns out it was 
screaming because it wasn't getting any fuel to pump due to a clogged 
gas tank.  I'll try not to ramble but the following 
are some suggested troubleshooting tips:

1.  Check for good flow out of the gas tank.  (My first tank was full 
of gunk, the &quot;reman&quot; replacement was clogged at the outlet).  Take 
the gas cap off, take the line off the tank outlet and see if you can 
drain a gallon or so out into a tank (you can reuse it).   If you 
don't get good flow, try attaching some spare line to the outlet and 
blow into it you may feel a clog break loose.

2.  Do a fuel flow volume test.  Unplug the return line from the 
pressure regulator by the distributor.  Attach some spare fuel line 
to the regulator and crank the engine.  You should get about .5 L in 
30 sec.

3.  Check for blocked fuel lines or injectors.

4.  Check for vacuum leaks. You can get a vacuum gauge for less than 
$20.  If not, it should be easy for a mechanic to check and (if its 
not the distributor vacuum advance like mine) could be a cheap fix.

5.  Check the throttle idle cutoff switch.

I can't think of anything else right now. If you can't resist buying 
a new fuel pump, Advance Auto sold me one for $160 with a lifetime 
warranty.  Good luck.
