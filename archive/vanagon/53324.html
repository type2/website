&gt; &gt;  huh?  ya think?  maybe this is an industry secret, the great Parts
&gt; &gt;  Conspiracy.  sell customers a $3000 fluid coupling when all it needs it a
&gt; &gt;  change of $20 worth of silicone brake fluid.  whose willing to try on
&gt; their
&gt; &gt;  trashed unit?
&gt; 
&gt; While admittedly possible, I'd evaluate the chances of this as very, very
&gt; slim.  I've never heard of silicon brake fluid having a characteristic of
&gt; gelling (or otherwise increasing its viscosity) when subjected to shear
&gt; stresses.  I would NOT encourage anyone to experiment with this in their
&gt; Syncro.

Yeah, and that silicone vacuum grease is silicone, too.  The viscosity and shear
characteristics of the various formulations are all over the map.  The positive hope
though, is that silicone-based viscous couplings (like the syncro uses) are becoming
quite common, so there is a real possibility that oil suitable for this application
will be found.  I doubt that brake fluid is even close -- right up there with spray
silicone lube in my book as a possibility.  Nor would I be tempted to fill mine 
with Molycote-111, the silicone grease I like to use alot.  A more interesting thing
for now would be to investigate the possibility of silicone differential fluids.  If
it is true that contaimination o fthe silicone fluid by the hypoid-gear lube is the
primary failure more, it might be safer if the differential lube was more compatible.
I am still suprised that these coupling are not offered as replacements for spider-gears
for positraction diffs in the aftermarket.  I'd love to have three of these instead
of two diffs and one.

Anybody?
