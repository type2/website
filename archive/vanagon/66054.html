Subject:      84 Westy -- Adding Seating

Hello Vanagon experts and fans.

I'm a newbie to this list, but not to Vanagons. I've owned my 84 Westy
for six years. About 18 months ago, we had an addition to our family --
and now we have five people to fit into only four places in our camper
van.

I figure the solution might be to add a seat, perhaps removable somehow,
facing backward directly behind the front passenger seat.

Should I do this? Who should I turn to for this work?

If I can't do something about the seating, I'm afraid I'll have to sell
it. :-(

Also, our poor van must sit outside and there are no prospects for
putting it inside a garage until at least next summer. So, I'm looking
for a van cover. I've looked around a lot but have turned up nothing.
Anybody know where I would get one?

Thanks,

Steve
