&gt;So here's a Friday question:
&gt;
&gt;Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?

You've got the context all wrong.  Outside/inside doesn't pertain to fast or
slow.  It is only used when the lanes are associated with a curve.  The
outside lanes are the fast lanes on a right hand curve and and the left lanes
on a right hand curve.  At least if you're driving on the RIGHT side of the
road.  :-)
