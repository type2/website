Subject: Questions on a 2nd battery

Howdy folks!

I'm back from my Solstice holiday, with a brand-new 300-watt inverter for my
van!  Yay!

Now that I have the inverter, I want to get a second battery.  I've read
most of the archive on this subject, and have a few questions on this
oft-covered topic:

1)  I understand why I need a deep-cycle battery.  I also know that I want
    to stick the battery under the drivers' seat.  The question, then, is
    what is the best deep-cycle battery for the job that doesn't 'stick out'
    of the battery compartment?  And where would I get it?

2)  A relay isolator sounds preferable to a diode isolator, but I've looked
    around and no one seems to carry the switched isolator.  Where would I
    find a relay isolator that can be switched off of the ignition?

3)  Are there any recommendations for shops in the bay area that would do a
    good job installing a second battery?


4)  Assuming that I don't want to run a TV, VCR, or microwave oven, how
    large of a battery do I really need?  (Mostly, I want to run a laptop
    computer and perhaps an external drive.)
