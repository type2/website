Subject:      Shrinking parts

I am.  But I have not (yet) done any testing to see how fast it is
happening.  And don't have a clue as to how to stop/repair it.  Jim McCarthy

&gt;Is anyone else experiencing shinking plastic trim pieces on their Westfalia
&gt;interiors.  It seems that around all the openings and the edges of the
&gt;tables and stove/sink covers the edging is slowly getting smaller exposing
&gt;the plywood.  I was wondering if it is from heat or is time the enemy?  Is
&gt;there anything that can be done to slow the process, or can this material be
&gt;replaced?  Just trying to keep it looking new for as long as possible.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
