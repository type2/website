So Tom Forhan says:
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to be calling PROPEX in England within the 
&gt; next couple of days to order a &quot;Propex Compact 1600&quot;, a
&gt; vented propane furnace for my Syncro Westie. I expect cost
&gt; to be around $600. These are the units that are often put in UK
&gt; buses, a couple of listmembers have installed them and are real
&gt; happy...see 
&gt; http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg13853&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.06
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm always ready to talk volume discounts, and its probably 
&gt; cheaper to handle export paperwork for one shipment, so if anyone
&gt; is interested in going in on this, please let me know asap.
&gt; 

I strongly suggest that those of you that feel you may be wanting
to purchase one of these in the next year or so to really consider
Tom's proposal.  You could probably save yourselfs may $100 or so.
The heater works great.  Wish I could have gotten a discount though.
