Subject: Re: Westy FS in North Jersey

&gt;As I analyzed how stupid it would be for me to buy this car (and that it 
&gt;would be stupid is a given, we're just dickering about degree), I was re-
&gt;minded how individual and ineconomic our hobby is.  I could probably get
&gt;more for my Porsche-powered Vanagon as a pile of parts than as a good
&gt;running van, and it would take approximately no time to get Mick's Westy
&gt;to the same condition:  some body work, fresh paint, put either my van's
&gt;VW engine or my &quot;extra&quot; 2.7 engine in it, and voila -- a $7500 van that
&gt;you could sell anywhere in the US for $3500.
&gt;
&gt;I guess if it made any economic sense it wouldn't be a hobby.

Yep, I think especially when it becomes a hobby/infatuation/life blood it
can get a little expensive even for the non-vanagon folks.  You start to
consider parts you &quot;should&quot; replace or modify that most &quot;normal&quot; drivers
wouldn't give a rodent's posterior about.  Of course you can drive it with
the rust/dents, but you know they're there and doesn't it gnaw at you?!  I
parted ways with my '67 galaxie 6 years ago and I can still remember every
little nook/cranny that needed attention.  It's been crushed long ago, but
my memory of those needed repairs haunts me.  I guess it's more like a sick
obsession and not a hobby...for some!
