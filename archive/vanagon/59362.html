&gt;Subject: Considering 1997 EuroVan Camper...
&gt;Message-ID: &lt;336CBF4E.75A_at_planetdata_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I am very seriously considering the purchase of a brand-new Eurovan
&gt;Camper (1997 model year).
&gt;
&gt;This is not a trivial decision (sticker price = $35,000.00), so I am
&gt;curious to know if anyone has firsthand experience purchasing or owning
&gt;one of these stylish new busmobiles.
&gt;
&gt;If you do, please share your knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;How much did you pay for the bus? (I never paid full sticker price for a
&gt;car before; I don't know if the dealer will expect me to for this one).
&gt;

Well, let's just say they weren't getting list price in December '95 when I
bought mine. High 20's has been the going rate for '95s around here, but I
don't know what they're actually getting for the '97. I've seen used '95s
in the paper for mid 20's - say $26K.

Remember there are two manufacturers making a profit on the van. VW dealer
price is probably 80% (based on other VW comparisons) but I have no idea
what the Winnebago markup is. Try knocking off 15% and see how hard they
push back.

&gt;Do you have a 5 or 6 cylinder engine (The 1997 has a 6-cylinder)? Do you
&gt;like it? Does it run too hot in the summer? Too cold in the winter?
&gt;

'95 has a 5 cyl, '97 has a 6 cyl. Forget all that stuff about it running
too hot in summer &amp; cold in winter - this is water-cooled land!
The 5 cylinder is more than adequate for the van, the 6 cylinder must
really show its stuff in the mountains - perhaps also in 0-60 times.

&gt;How's the heat? (We're expecting it to do double-duty as a carpooler).
&gt;

&gt;How's the A/C? (And the kids don't like to be too hot).
&gt;

There have been complaints (well, one actually) about the rear heating under
extreme conditions in Canadian Mtns. This was on a '95 - which doesn't have
heat or A/C ducts in the back. The '97 model does have a heat duct, just
behind
the passenger seat. If you bought a '95 you might want to make sure there's
a blanket in the back - locally temps in the 30's haven't bothered
passengers in mine.

I drove my '95 across Eastern BC and Eastern Washington last summer in
&gt;100F temps - the A/C worked great! (So well in fact that I drove for 14
hours rather than get out and do anything in that heat!)


&gt;Any surprises (good or bad) associated with the bus?
&gt;
Just make sure that everything in the camper works before you drive it off
the lot, if you're buying one new. Winnebago quality control seems to be
less than perfect - but everything is covered under 2 yr warranty. It just
makes it simpler if you show it doesn't work and get a service order
written then and there - they're also more expedient in fixing those
problems sometimes!

Oh, and make sure you have a dealer who's willing/able to work on the
Camper components. If not, you'll be visiting a Winnebago place and most of
them have never seen these critters.

&gt;Any thoughts (via the list or by direct mail) are appreciated.
&gt;

&gt;Thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt;PS - It's finally sunny here. I'll shoot some pictures of my 1967 Combi
&gt;(which is for sale) and get them up this week. Watch the Type 2 list (or
&gt;send me email) for details.

It drives a lot differently than a bus/vanagon - longer wheelbase plus
you're not sitting right over the wheels. Can't see the bumper anymore
which makes one unsure how close something is to the front. It's pretty
decadent too, you may get spoiled in a hurry - good thing you're selling
that '67. (If you were any close I'd be interested in the '67 -I always
wanted one of those!)
