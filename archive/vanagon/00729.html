Subject: Re: all us buses on the list

Thanks Joel, for posting that information.  To the rest of you, one of 
the reasons I asked Joel to post it was to cut down on the public roll 
call which generates a lot of messages.  So, If you want to correct your 
entry on Joel's list, please respond directly to him, and after he's 
gotten more of the names cleaned up, he can post again.

Thanks!
