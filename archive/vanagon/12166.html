Subject: engine update

Today, I straightened my one bent conn rod.  I have a bunch of machinist's 
tools, and used the table of my 1940's bandsaw for a surface plate.  I was 
going to take it to a local machine shop, but I changed my mind when the guy 
said &quot; can you see the bend by looking at it?&quot;  Can we all say ... 
scarrrrry.  It turned out to be bent about .020&quot; over the length of the 
wrist pin and about .022&quot; of twist over the width of the big end.  I used a 
18&quot; pipe wrench and a piece of 1/16&quot; aluminum to do the bending.  Put it all 
back together and she turns over much better now.  

Now the question is to check the other 3 or not?  I think they are pretty 
straight, but in the name of thourough-ness, it looks like I'll take the 
others out and check.

Did anyone have an opinion on my CR of 7.7 to one?
