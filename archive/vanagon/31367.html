Subject: dash lights

On the way to work this morning there was a faint 'pop' and the dash
lights went dead (the ones that illuminate the dash  when the headlights
are on).  Fortunately the headlights are ok.  Everything else seems to be
ok too (including the warning lights inside the dash).  Fuses are ok.
This is an '87 GL.

There are two bulbs (one for the speedo side and one for the tach side)
right?  If so, its unlikely that both would blow simultaneously.  Is
there a relay involved that may be the cause?  We're leaving tomorrow
afternoon for a 400 mile road trip.  Looks like I'll be in the dark ...

Tom
