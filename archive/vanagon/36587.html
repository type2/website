Subject: re: '78 vs '88 Westy - update

Many thanks to all who've offered advice so far on this issue.

Based on the high price (~$5500) , the owner's reluctance to reduce it, and the 
number of unknowns &amp; parts needed, I've decided to pass on the '78 
Westy. If it had felt exceptional to drive, it would've been worth 
pursuing, but it didn't really feel a lot better than the '72 I 
drove last weekend (for 1/3 the price).

I've made arrangements to take home the '88 tonight &amp; keep it til 
Sat. so I can drive it long, start it on a cold engine, do some 
fluid level checks, etc. (I'll be using the extensive check lists provided by 
list members to help me here :-) )

One quick question though - does anyone have the compression specs 
for new and wear-limit for the 2.1L engine?

Many thanks to all who've helped in my long search - here's hoping it 
will end soon...

Shawn.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
