&gt;Excluding Thom, does this make the the honorary owner of the oldest

&gt;
&gt;Oh speaking of that, couple questions for the guru's.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a connection for 50's bumpers?  Looking for a set
&gt;for my bus.

there are some pretty beat up ones about 4 hours away from me....
&gt;
&gt;What year did they change the dashboard around the radio on the
&gt;microbus?  I put a normal DIN sized radio in my '67 (No it was
&gt;already cut up), and there is solid metal around the whole thing.  In
&gt;my friends '64 he has a fullsize radio in his, but there is not metal
&gt;around the whole thing, the little slots cut into the dashboard don't
&gt;quit before the radio.  Likewise my '57 is this way, if I were to put
&gt;a new radio in there (Not even considering it!) it wouldn't fit with
&gt;solid metal around it.
&gt;
&gt;I am guessing it was changed like '66 or somewhere in there?  Ideas.

yes 66' was the last year for the old style radio. 67' changed to the big
honkin square hole.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly:
&gt;
&gt;Is there a company that either refinishes steering wheels.  The
&gt;enamel (?) is worn off the '57's and I'd like it fixed.  I hear
&gt;though that the wheel doesn't come off exactly easy.  Is there a
&gt;place that sells repro's?

one person i know is bob koch in california who does &quot;show quality&quot; (usual
disclaimers apply) steering wheel resto's. he advertise's in the back of
all the big VW rags (esp. HVW's)

you can pull the steering wheel off with a standard 3 prong &quot;puller&quot;.
Personally i have taken off steering wheels by removing the securing nut
(obvious once you disconnect and remove the horn button) and then *lightly*
tapping the underside of the steering wheel (close to the centre of the
wheel as possible) off with a rubber mallet, until it comes off. By going
the rubber mallet route, you run the risk of cracking your wheel, so
probably using the 3 prong puller would be best option.

&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help!
