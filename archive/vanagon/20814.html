&gt;yes. a single-seat additional middle seat was available as an option.
however,
&gt;they are extremely rare. :( and to purchase one from the dealer is outrageous
&gt;... $900!!!!

$900 OUCH!!!
A guy might think about bolting his living room love seat to the floor of
this bus for about half the price.

Interesting though, I think this third seat option in the 95 EV Camper is
about $400 to $500
