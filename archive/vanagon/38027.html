&gt;what you would add / subtract from your
&gt; current setup.

Know what I want? Package shelf. It's really the only thing I envy in
Splits except the swinging doors. The package shelf is useful, the space is
otherwise wasted, and no way could you do it in a front-engine. I will
never understand why they dropped it.

I got all excited about your plywood offer until I thought about how
prohibitive it would be to ship that stuff around. Thanks anyway, though.
