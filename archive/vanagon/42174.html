Subject: More on the eight Corvairs...


I went ahead and called the number, out of curiosity. Here's the deal:

It's an older gentleman selling the cars for his son's father-in-law. The
gentleman knows absolutely nothing about Corvairs, can not definitely
testify that the cars are complete. He says that if the cars are not
complete he's willing to negotiate *further* on the price. More on that in
a moment:

The cars are on property that has either been sold or is being sold, and
they need the cars removed soon. The man the cars actually belong to is in
poor health. I'm free to look all around if I like.

He says he'll take two thousand for the LOT of eight Corvairs, less if
there are bits missing. Says &quot;there is grass grown up around them.&quot; (It's
okay, this is the South, the drivelines will have survived fine if the
boots stayed shut). says there are wheels on them but he doesn't know if
they will roll...

I am considering buying the lot and splitting them. If anybody is
interested in these engines let me know, like, right now.
