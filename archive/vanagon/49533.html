Subject: Vw's &amp; Computers (Little VW content)

Hello Volks,
        At the shift change this afternoon we were talking about computers.
One of the guys coming to work had just bought a new one, a Gateway 2000.
There was a lively discussion on hard drives, RAM, CPU speed, video cards,
modems and talk about &quot;BIG Monitors&quot; (We just go a 21&quot; at work and he bought
a 17&quot;)
        I was thinking that 20 years ago they would have been talking about
cars, a new car maybe. It would have been about carbs not cpu's, I'll bet 20
years ago that guy could have bought a new VW bus for the dollar amount he
spent on that computer today.
        Keep in mind that these are helicopter mechanics talking, not
computer people. My how the world changes. For the price of a computer today
you could have bought a car then, for the price of a car now you could have
bought a house then.
        All I want to do is keep the bus I have running. Now that I think
about it that is what I wanted 20 years ago too!
        Later all.
        Rob
