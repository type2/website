&gt;   just getting mentally set for that engine swap from the 73 bus to the 74
&gt; and vice versa...do i need to disconnect the gearshift lever when i take out
&gt; the engine ??? i suppose for taking out the engine i'll have to lower the
&gt; rear end of the tranny somewhat, and that might bend the gearshift thingy if
&gt; i don't remove it. any opinions ??? and do i disconnect it right at the
&gt; tranny or where ???

You don't need to disconnect the gearshift lever.  You don't need to
do anything to the tranny.  Just remove the fan housing from the engine
and you will have plenty of room.  It only takes a few minutes...
