&gt;
&gt;The complexity of cars has followed a steady upward progression while the
&gt;person behind the parts counter remains someone willing to work for a minimum
&gt;wage.
&gt;

Or, The only people the store owners/managers are willing to hire are
those that will work for minimum wage.  Then... you get what you pay
for.  I've given up listening to auto parts store employees
completely.  I'm clueless enough as it is without being confused by
someone who knows no more (if not less:) than me.

and now my favorite quote:
 
&quot;Of course this alternator will work.  You don't really need to plug in
that little wire on Volkswagens, just tape it up.&quot;

take care all,
	   brandy
