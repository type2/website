Subject: Re: Suggestions for installing Home Stereo in '73 Bus 
Date: Tue, 04 Apr 1995 09:05:59 PDT

&gt; I need some suggestions as to what type of batteries, inverter (if
&gt; necessary), charger, etc. to buy to install my home stereo in my bus.  It
&gt; includes a 100W amp driving Bose AM-5 (satellite) speakers and a CD changer
&gt; as well as a dual tape deck.  

Sounds like a motorhome stereo. :)

&gt; I would want to go 5 days between charges
&gt; using the stereo up to 8 hrs. a day while travelling (if possible).

It would be far more energy efficient to sell the home stereo and install
a car stereo. The energy loss (expressed in heat) from an inverter big
enough to provide the 500W AC (_at_120V) necessary to drive your stereo and
power amp are hideous, compared to a simple 12V regulated power amp made
for cars.

If you ever want to run the stereo with the engine off, you'll eat your
battery rather quickly.

&gt; It
&gt; would also be nice to run a small 110 volt accessory (like a rice cooker)
&gt; now and then without worry of overly depleting the charge.

Again, AC elements that are made for high wattage and heat are not suited
to automotive applications without a regular generator or a LOT of juice
in the form of heavy batteries.

&gt; Also, is there a way to install an in-line charger that diverts excess
&gt; charge from the starter battery to RV or Marine batteries?

There are many forms of battery isolators made for this purpose.

&gt; I've checked out the archives in great depth and done outside research but
&gt; still can't figure out the best arrangement.  I need someone's opinion who's
&gt; done something like this before.  

Well, of the inverters that I have used, none of them puts out enough
wattage efficiently to justify them over a good quiet Honda generator.

Admittedly you can't use the generator when you're cruising down the
road, but I suggest that you won't want to be using the rice cooker or
a hair dryer at that time either.
