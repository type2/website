&gt;I pulled off the plastic bag from the distributor, and it promptly 
&gt;started to disintegrate.  Gotta get a new one, I guess!  

My 87 Syncro did not have one of these when I bought it used.  I recall that
VW's price for this little thing seemed very high (of course) and I did not
buy it.  I remember seeing a ford Mustang with a rubber distributer cover and
thought about seeing if one of those would work on the Syncro.  I never did
check, but I bet it would be 1/3 the price of the VW one.

&gt;Anyway, the 
&gt;rotor wasn't bad, but the distributor cap was due for replacement.  
&gt;No problem, I thought.  I bought a new cap and rotor last fall from 
&gt;my dealer, and figured now would be good time to install it.  Well, I 
&gt;think I have the wrong cap.  
&gt;

&gt;The cap on the van has a metal shroud around it with a braided copper 
&gt;ground strap attached.  The cap I bought last fall doesn't.  It has a 
&gt;black plastic cover over the brown cap with a metal tab where the 
&gt;spring clip locks onto the cap.  Hmmmm.  I couldn't get the old cap 
&gt;out of the metal shroud as it is crimped on, but the black plastic 
&gt;cover can come off the new cap.  Ok, put it all back together, and 
&gt;write this note for clarification.

Also check to see what type of connectors are in the wire holes in the cap.
 I know that in my Vanagons it's not just a hole where the connector makes
contact around the perimiter but instead has a connector post in the center
of the hole where the spark plug wires connect.
