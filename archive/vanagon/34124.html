I think they gut themselves.  Or maybe too much push starting?
In FL, with a gutted converter, I passed (barely) ;) one year and failed 
(barely) the next. :(

&gt; Just a data point to consider... My cat was gutted out years ago and I've 
&gt; never failed a test in Oregon as a result. Of course PA emissions could be 
&gt; more stringent. Should I feel guilty?
