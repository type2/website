Subject: Pop-top Protection

I have a blue '90 Vanagon Multi-Van.

The Pop-top is starting to chalk and fade.  I've tried most commercial topical 
products (Color-Back, etc.) but they are only good until the first rain.

Does anybody have any tips for some kind of sealant that I could apply (or
have applied professionally)?  I'm nervous about just taking it to a paint
shop and getting their advice.

Hi VWers,

I have not posted in a very long time,
been lurking for quit a qhile.

I have an 84 Vanagon, and would like to hook up
the  speakers that hang from the ceiling
 back by the hatch.  The wires are by the
hatch, does anyone know how they are
routed to the front and if they stay the same
color all the way to the front?

Thanks
