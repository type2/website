	We finally got the transmission working on my bus.

	We had 2 problems:

	A) A _severe_ fluid leak from the right side plate (not the diff plate)
	B) The wheels would not turn independently of each other.

	We fixed problem A by persuading the side cover plate back to a reasonable
shape with a pair of vice grips, a 3&quot; extension, a body hammer and a screw
driver, a block of wood, and a claw hammer.  You don't want to know the details.
	
	I fixed problem B by removing the side plate, circlip, spacer and pulling
the side gear, and then reinstalling it, but much more gently.  The problem
was the side gear binding on the spider gears.  It turns out that there is
a trick drag racers use, by adding an extra washer to do the same thing, which
disable the differential, effective locking the rear end.

	We got everything put back together by dark, even.  No fluid leaking
at all now!

	Did the obligitory test drive:  It looks like I'll need to make minor 
adjustments to the shifter, but other than that its groovy!
