Hey all,
Yesterday I drove from Fredericksburg, VA to Laurel MD, which turned out
to be a round trip of 175 miles (I love trip odometers!) and I filled
the tank immediately before getting on the interstate, so it was all
highway driving.  Well, I filled up again when I got back and in that
175 miles I had used 11.065 gallons of gas, whihc comes out to 15.85
mpg!  That's awful!  I was driving with the speedometer between 60 and
65, depending on who was in front of me.  It's depressing to see the gas
gauge be that far down after a short trip like that.  Everything seems
to be running normally and all that.  Anyone got mileage like that on
the highway?  That's about 5 mpg less than my old '78 got on the
highway.  

Sean
