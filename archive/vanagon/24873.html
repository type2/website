&gt;O.  And Bay windows buses are cool.. but.... not that cool.
&gt;And Vangons... well, they're nice, but I think I'll cut mine into a bunch 
&gt;of little pieces, it'll be worth more.

&gt;Bradley
&gt;
          Well, Bradley ...being over 6'2 1/2&quot; I tried driving a splitie
          but I got tired of bending down to see or mistaking the metal 
          piece in the middle for a tree in the road. No, I like my view
unobstructed and panoramic...not looking through a porthole.
