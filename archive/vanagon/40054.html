Subject: What has happened to gasoline prices? (fwd)
Date: Thu, 18 Apr 96 14:51:16 EDT

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Here in San Diego, CA, gasoline has jumped up to $1.50 per gallon
&gt; (that's about 40 cents per litre).  This is an increase of over 20%
&gt; in the last month.  
&gt; 
&gt; HAve other parts of the USA had such a large increase?

Bob and others,
Well, gas here (at the cheapie station, Racetrac) has gone up to almost
$1.20 and that's for 87 octane.  Not too long ago, it was less than
$.99.  The name brand stations like Amoco, Exxon, Mobil, etc are even
higher, usually by 3 or 4 cents.

Not cool,
Sean
