&gt;My VIN is WV2ZB0257FH051307.  In looking at some tech bulletins, they
&gt;refer to VINs liek 25 FM 050 887 Dec 84 and 25 FH 037 898 Nov 94.  My
&gt;camper was picked up on site in Germany in late January, 85, so I suppose
&gt;it was built sometime in the fall of '84 - around the VINs shown.
&gt;So - how do I read my VIN to know whether mine is earlier or later ...
&gt;I assume skip everything up to the 25, then skip the 7.  Is that right?
&gt;And how do I get a date out of that?  Thanks.

the date you'll have to get from the sticker on the door post. but the VIN
works this way:

VIN Interpretation: for model years 1981-1991.
                    (model year 1980 is the same as 1968-1979)

so the only things you are really interested in is the seq. prod. number,
the last six digits ... that's the break-point of the fiche and tech bulletins
... the 25 F part just means any transporter of 1985(F).  even the date part
is superfluous info (cause if you get the seq. prod. number, it was only made
on one date).
