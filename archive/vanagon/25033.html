&gt;For the first time I have just personally seen Bradley's '80 camper
&gt;he has for sale for $700.  Volks, this is a STEAL.  If I didn't already
&gt;have an '81 westy, I'd jump at this.  It's in wonderful condition
&gt;considering it's age, and many of it's features were far better than
&gt;I had expected.  It would be a crime to let this bus be hacked up!
&gt;
&gt;I believe that Bradley plans to part it out if no one has purchased it
&gt;by this coming Tuesday, when I undestand he plans on stripping the
&gt;interior and dumping it.  The van would not take much work in or out
&gt;to put it in very nice condition.  If I didn't already have 3 VWs, I'd
&gt;consider taking on the project myself.

Why is he selling it? I may have missed a previous post... sorry.


&gt;Snoozers lose.  The early bird catches the worm.  Come and get it.

Late risers get only cold water for their showers!
(Sorry, Martha, couldn't resist)   :^)
