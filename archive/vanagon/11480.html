Subject: Re: westy H20 leak


I had a leak in the trap under the sink. There are 2 types of trap, one
that is pictured in the slim 80-82 vanagon bentley - regular &quot;household
trap&quot;, and the other type - sort of a cup/bowl with a hose coming out of
the side. I have the latter. The leak was at the hose-bowl junction which
turned out to be broken. A replacement bowl and gasket was found at a rv
place, surprisingly cheap ($4-6), and when I installed the new one I had a
wee bit of difficulty in getting a good seal between the bowl and sink.
I would get a drip from the joint when the water couldn't drain away fast
enough. But now everything is hunkey-dorey.

Alistair, without the sodden paper towels that were stored under the
leaking sink, Bell
