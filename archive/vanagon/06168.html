Subject: Re: Rear axle nut. Uuugh!

	Chris,
	John Kuthe's right- break anything that says Craftsman, you take
it back and get another. I've done socket adaptors, flex handles and
a shovel (!). There was a great story in Fine Homebuilding a couple of 
years ago about a guy who bought a sander to remove paint from his house
and traded it in FIVE TIMES before the job was done. A friend of mine
bought a Craftsman 1/2&quot; handle at a garage sale for $1, broke it on
a bus axle nut and traded it for a brand new one all in the same week.
Forever is a long time.

	My brother and his friend Mitch had a neat solution for this
problem. Take the vehicle to your favorite repair place, tell them
what you want and ask it they'll bust the nut loose. I don't think
they ever had to pay for it, even at a dealership. Air powered impact tools
are designed for this kind of thing and do it really well.
	Once the nut is loosened, the shop guy torques it back
up to 245 foot lb or whatever and you drive home and pop it right off.
Don't forget to buy a new cotter pin!

	Bill
