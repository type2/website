&gt;&gt;        This sounds a lot like Vanagon Syndrome (yes--so many Vanagons have
&gt;&gt;      this problem that there is a special name for it). 
&gt;
&gt; when it's down you have to fiddle in the engine
&gt;compartment to make it work--doesn't really matter what you fiddle with
&gt;as long as you fiddle; then it magically works until the next time it
&gt;breaks, then fiddle and repeat cycle. 

Hello Folks,
        No help with this specific problem, but it reminded of another fix I
did.
 
Had a bus, that would start cutting out, missing bad and then stop. It came
and went. I found I could fix it by pulling the plug on the carb, draining
the bowl, then restarting. Worked every time. I always got some crud out of
the bowl, but didn't want to mess with the fuel tank.

What was really happening was that as I was getting in to the carb I'd move
a wire that went to the coil. It had a loose connection, it would vibe
enough to stop the bus, messing with the carb would &quot;fix&quot; it. I found it one
day when I was by the side of the road fixing the carb, with ny hand in
there I'd here a &quot;tick&quot; noise, it was the loose wire making the connection
and then loseing it. 

Just cause a wire tests good with a meter doesn't mean it's ok. I always
wiggle the connectors, just to make sure!

Good luck all,



Rob
