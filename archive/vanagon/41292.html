Subject: Re: bike racks

&gt;Hey everyone!
&gt;I posted a message yesterday asking about a bike rack for my syncro.  I got
&gt;a couple responses, but would appreciate any more advice there is out
&gt;there.
&gt;Does anyone have a roof mount rack on their vanagon?  Would you recommend
&gt;it?  Specifically, any clearance problems? (other than parking garages and
&gt;burger king drive thru), noise or drag??, trouble throwing your bikes up
&gt;there?
&gt;I know there's other types out there, and am open to suggestions (the two I
&gt;got already were pretty good)!  One particular concern is the ability to
&gt;lock it, as the two bikes are worth more than the van, and i'd rather not
&gt;have to sleep with them if we decide to camp.
&gt;And again, if anyone has one for sale, let me know.
&gt;Thank you very much!!
&gt;

I found, what is for me, the perfect solution.  It's something called a
&quot;hoop rack,&quot; which they hooked me up with at my LBS (local bike shop).  It
is like a big U, upside down, with the ends getting bolted on to the
bumbper with a neat U-Bolt and hook clamp type thing.  It works absolutely
wonderfully for what I need.  Mounts on the front without having to find
neat spots to weld, I think it will fit on top of a front-mounted tire.

It even (kind of) solves your locking problem:  If you lock your bike to
it, a thief would have to unbolt the sucker or beat your locking mechanism
(always a threat anyway).  Hope this helps.
