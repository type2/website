&gt;Isn't it true as far as ignition timing goes, hook up a vacuum
&gt;meter/gauge to any main vacuum lines and turn the distributor until you
&gt;get the highest vacuum reading.  Now you have the perfect timing!  Told
&gt;it works for all cars.
&gt;
&gt;Any truth to this timing method?
&gt;

May be optimal for that single operating point, but will timing be
acceptable over the entire range of operation?  There are factors like
vacuum and centrifugal advance etc.

I don't really know if this is the best way to go.
