&gt;(re about replacing muffler at 40K/1 year)
&gt;
&gt;1 year seems kinda fast but if you are in MN (?) appreciate that the
&gt;winter is a real killer on mufflers ...
&gt;

I understand that muffler longevity depends a lot on how much rust forms
inside the muffler. Driving short distances seems to be the main culprit,
since the muffler remains relatively cool, thereby allowing vapor in the
exhaust to condensate.
