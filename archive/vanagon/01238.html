&gt;An older issue of European Car details a very clean California conversion
&gt;of a Syncro.  It was to a 3.2 litre Porsche engine, 230HP. Fitted under the

yeah, that was nice. :)  but i have 'heard' that the fellow is having a bit
of problems with the transmissions ... the story was that the porsche engine
was a bit much for the vw transmissions. so you might have to fit a porsche
911 5-speed gearbox as well. :( (aw ... wouldn't THAT be a shame. :)

&gt;        Finally, have owned seven buses, '71 to '85, I feel the earlier ones
&gt;will readily outperform the Vanagons in nasty stuff. The vanagon to microbus

yup. i'll have to agree. the 68-79 buses are much much better in the woods
than the vanagons. but i still got around in my old 80 vanagon. the air-cooled
engined vanagons can do ok (if you are careful ... you don't have quite as
much ground clearance, and the rear wheels don't seem to want to grip the
mud quite as good).  but the water-cooled vanagons ... well, it seems to me
that the torque is all 'wrong'. i guess it really is designed for highway
driving and not playing in the mud. i suppose by the time it was designed,
they figured there were not any more muddy dirt roads out there (so what do
the folks in the Third World Countries get in their VW showrooms?). or maybe
it's just the gearing of the u.s. version transmission.

anyway, there ain't nothing like being out in the middle of nowhere in texas
with no road, no buildings, no nothing but the somewhat-sparse grass and sky.
and your trusty old vw bus.  but i will warn you: never ever chase jackrabbits
through the grass!! (thar be stumps and holes out there ... and them #$%&amp;
rabbits will go straight for them every time). chasing horny toad critters
is ok. :)
