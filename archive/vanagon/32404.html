&gt; You just defined how a turbocharger works.  You have to be careful --
&gt; any positive pressure above a ratio of 1.3 will possibly ruin the
&gt; heads.  

Ummm... how come?  As long as there is no detonation, I don't see how
boost can harm the heads.

&gt; 		In terms of being able to get this kind of boost with a mere
&gt; fan, I'd say it is unlikely.  

Agreed.

&gt; 								Turbochargers use turbines inserted in
&gt; the exhaust pipeline to get enough power for the compressor of the
&gt; booster.  Another thing to watch out:  there may be flaps/valves
&gt; inside the carbs that will not react predictably to positive presuure:
&gt; the choke flaps are a good example (they will operate when they are
&gt; being sucked on, but will they operate when soemthing is putting
&gt; pressure on them from the other side?)

Another listmember pointed out the obvious problems with the venturi
effect in carbs.  The positive air pressure would tend to push the fuel
back into the float bowl when the throttle is closed, since there is
no fuel pressure to prevent it.  I hadn't thought of this - all of my 
experience with forced induction has been on fuel injected cars.  

&gt; If you actually get to do this, assuming you cover up all pressure
&gt; leaks, etc..., you'll find out that the electric motor will draw a lot
&gt; more than 6 amps as you get better and better pressure buildup inside
&gt; the air cleaner assembly.  You see, the motor requires 6 amps at the
&gt; amount of work it is currently doing.  If there's a real pressure
&gt; differential at both sides of the fan (1.0/1.3 atmospheres), then it
&gt; will have to work harder to keep  'pumping' the  air  to the high-pressure
&gt; side.

I have to disagree with you here.  The motor is drawing the maximum
current when there is nothing blocking the fan (i.e. it is moving the
maximum volume of air).  As less air moves, the air begins to cavitate
at the fan and the motor speeds up.  Recall what happens if you put your 
hand over the air intake of a hair dryer.

&gt; My guess is the improvement will be minimal at best.

You're probably right, but I can hope, can't I?  :-)
