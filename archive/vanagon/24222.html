The dark green that was combined with the pearl white was the &quot;Velvet Green
L512&quot;

&gt;&gt; L82 &quot;Silver White&quot; is typically used only on the bumpers, wheels, and where
&gt;&gt; applicable, the poptop for the Westfalias. This L82 differs from the L87
&gt;&gt; &quot;Pearl White.&quot; The &quot;Silver White&quot; has a very, very slight bluish hue to it.
&gt;
&gt;Would you happen to have a formula for the L87 &quot;Pearl White&quot;?  I have a 
&gt;'66 Bus that I am resotring and want to paint the top half L87.
&gt;
&gt;I also am trying to find out what the VW dark green was called.  I have 
&gt;seen it in several old advertisements from VW but only on bugs.  I want 
&gt;to use this green for the lower half.
&gt;
&gt;Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
