&gt; those front grills are brittle, eh? I've broken off a bit of mine while
&gt; trying to pusht the van out of a muddy spot. I managed to glue it back on
&gt; with polystyrene cement (what memories that stuff recalls!) which worked
&gt; for about 8 months. I don't think toluene is the best solvent for whatever
&gt; plastic the grill is made of. Ive just re-glued it with fly tying head
&gt; cement (Loon brand). At the wreckers, you never seem to find a complete
&gt; grill, but I am toying with the idea of cutting up a broken grill for
&gt; replacement bits for my grill, which if left unhelped, will probably end
&gt; up looking like a photo from the Big Book of British smiles.

I was following some Pickup truck down the highway with those extra wide
flared fibreglass fenders over the double rear wheels.  He swerved to 
avoid a plastic bag on the road and hit the cement median.
The fender flew off and cracked my grille but it held together so I left
it.  It all got replaced after my accident last fall anyway.  :)
