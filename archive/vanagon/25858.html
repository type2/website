Yo...

	Well, at the insistence of the Bob, I adjusted the link pins today.
Took most of the afternoon.  Well, it took about 10 minutes to adjust them,
but a lot of time before hand to scrape crud, de-grease, rinse, and re-paint
the whole shebang.  Took 1 1/2 6-disk CD magazines on random to complete
the whole thing.  I'm sure the neighbors love me :)

	It was all pretty straightforward, albeit icky.  Almost looks brand
new now, and the steering feels a tad smoother, like easier, but not loose.
Like a casual lover...

	I also re-packed the front wheel bearings and replaced the seals
and lock tabs.  And packed the bores with lots grease.  Went thru a whole
can, today!

	Which leads me to a question I think I know the answer to:
One of the bearing races (inner, passenger, specifically) is turning in the
drum.  I percieve this to be a Bad Thing (TM)  Meaning I prolly need a new
drug^Hm Do y'all concur?  I guess I should also replace both then, and new
wheel bearings, hell, I guess shoes too... (sigh) There goes my dream of
safaris.  Anyone know what early front drumz go for$$?  I lent my catalogs
out....

	Another side project was to take the number plate (serial number) and
de-rust it and rivet it back in.  I also clear coated it first.
