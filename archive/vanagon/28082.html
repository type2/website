&gt; I just received the after market seal from Bus Boys (not a bad price either
&gt; - $69) for my Westy, and as soon as it stops raining, I plan to approach
&gt; this job in the proper Zen-like manner.  Ha!  
&gt; 
&gt; (BTW, If anyone knows what the proper Zen-Like manner is, please let me know.)

In proper Zen-like manner be as one with the top seal and be as one with 
the bus.  While being as one with the seal and bus they will be also as one 
and well gosh I guess you're done.....
