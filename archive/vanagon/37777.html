&gt; Hey Sean, 
&gt; actually, I am a Psych major.  I have studies Freud now for 2 years, and
&gt; it is clear that people who are anal retentive are NOT messy.  They are
&gt; very concerned with order and particulars, like keeping things neat.
&gt; It's the anal expulsive people who are messy and aren't concerned with order.
&gt; 
&gt; just trying to clear things up....
&gt;

&gt; '79 bus with a anal retentive owner :)
&gt; 
Hey all,
As you can see, Paul has informed me that I might not have been paying
attention as well as I thought I was :) .  

A wise old saying comes back to me:

It is better to have everyone think you are an idiot than to open your
mouth and remove all doubt :) .  

sorry if I've confused anyone.

Sean
