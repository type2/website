&gt;&gt;freight. If he will split the cars and the drivetrains are still in, I'm
&gt;&gt;willing to do a limited amount of dismantling but I won't have any idea
&gt;&gt;what I'm doing. I've never even looked inside the boot of a Corvair.


        I know that this isn't a bus question, but, will a Corvair engine
fit inside a 'Thing' (type 181).  My 181 hasn't moved in about 10 years and
the motor is one of it's many troubles (it didn't make it into the garage so
it's been sitting half-in half-out all these years).  I looked in my Kennedy
engine adapter catalog to see if it would be a good fit, and the catalog had
nothing to say about 181's.  This was my first car and it has some
nostalagic value to me, as such I wouldn't want to butcher it.  Just wondering.

        Now for bus content.  A couple of days ago someone asked about
vanagon curtans.  I opted for the curtan rod only kit from Bus Boys and I
intend to get my wife to sew the curtans.  even with the cost of seven yards
of cloth it seemed a better way to go.  I'll have to wait and see how it
turns out thow.
