&lt;&lt; Also, I read about Synrco's. What is a Syncro?  &gt;&gt;

Syncro is VW's term for their all-wheel-drive system.  In the USA VW began
selling Syncro versions of Vanagons &amp; Quantums.  Although they were both
called Syncro by VW, the Quantum actually used Audi's Quattro system.  Other
than both of them being all-wheel-drive, they have nothing in common.  Since
then VW has had Syncro versions of numerous models, but none of them in the
USA.  :(

The Vanagon Syncro was sold in the USA in model years 1986, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91
in both regular and Camper versions.
