&gt;still $25 for a set of Chinese combination wrenches up 
&gt;to 32mm is unbeatable, go price one single Craftman wrench over 19mm 

uhhh.... er, well

&gt;if you don't believe me, use the stuff once and it will pay for 
&gt;itself, 

ah.  true.  it will pay for itself but often only 'once'.  a higher quality
tool will pay for itself many times.  now, that said, i DO carry a cheap set
of Chinese sockets in the van at all times.  they are intended to pay for
themselves ONCE, when i break down.  the Snap-Ons pay for themselves
repeatedly in the garage.  in fact, the Snap-Ons are now on their second
generation.  my father used them throughout his career up until last year
when he gave them to me.  and now my son and daughter are approaching the
age where they can also use them for their 'repairs'.  yes, good tools are
incredibly expensive.  but if something is going to last for several
generations AND provide excellent service during those years, they are worth
the high price of admission.

this isn't a Yuppie purchase rationalization.  well, not too much.  years
ago (back in Joel's day :) things were generally made to have a long service
life but they were also expensive in terms of the percentage of annual
income it took to initially buy the thing.  you saved and then it was a big
deal when you came home with an anvil, a drill press, or a pipe wrench.  but
you knew you wouldn't have to be buying another one for decades.  now, the
good tools are still available but at what appears to be comparatively
outrageous prices due to the plethora of cheap imported junk. but don't be
deceived, the utility is still there in the quality tool purchase.

&lt;soapbox mode off&gt;

-dan (who when threatened in a dark corner will admit to buying imported
junk too)
