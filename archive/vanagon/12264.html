Martha salivates:
&gt; Is the 13 gallon vessel rectangular?  Regardless, where can I get one!!???

The vessel would be round as a beer keg, in fact...

I cut the top off of a 15.5 gallon beer keg, added 2 handles, and a 
ball valve spout on the bottom for drawing off the wort (liquid in 
beer before it is fermented).  Also works for finishing maple syrup!
