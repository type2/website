Subject: Very random thoughts VDub

Last month I discovered the gas heater on the
79 Bus was quite dead, so Tuesday I went at it
and I think the little electronic gizmo box
(did the VW place call it I relay?) that parcels
out power to the igniter, blower, etc. was fried.
Couldn't find a used one, so had to order from the
VW dealer up in Des Moines.  $176!!

On a happier note, Da Spouse said, out of a clear
blue sky, &quot;Let's sell the Mazda and get another
Bus.&quot;  I nearly fell over.  The '79 is already
the &quot;family car&quot;, and the Red Rollerskate (Mazda)
was the Commutermobile.  But I'm not going to complain.
Three Busses (or maybe a Vanagon fer Da Spouse...)  Wow.
