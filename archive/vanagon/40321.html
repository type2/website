Subject: 1980 Vanagon Farts...

I have an unusual problem. I have a 1980 Vanagon with an engine from a 1979.
It's a 2 litre with hydrolic lifters. I've noticed it being hard to keep
running when it's first started. It's as though it needs a choke, but I know
it's fuel injected. After it gets a little warmed up it seems to run ok. It
does have one small problem. It seems to be running fine, then it farts. No
power for about a half of a second. Then it's back up to speed. I've noticed
no backfiring, just a spit second loss of power. 

Anyone have any ideas?
