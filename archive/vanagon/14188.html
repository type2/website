Subject: Do I have the correct pressure plate? (Vol II)

O.K. I've got a new pressure plate, tt.o. bearing and fork, but before I 
put it all together and detonate another bearing I want to make sure I 
have the right combination. My trans is pre-1970 and my engine is 
post-1970. I have the bearing with the raised center ring. I am mating 
this with the p.plate with the three large arms and the center ring. 

IS THIS THE CORRECT COMBO?

My main question is do I have to remove the ring from the p.plate 
(because the bearing has the raised ring) or should I leave it alone. 

Thanks,

--Jonny B-)
