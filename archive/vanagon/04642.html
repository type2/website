&gt; Here's the first problem:
&gt; I am trying to order the head gasket but the following choices are possible:
&gt; (1) a 2 grove or a 3 grove gasket.  Does anyone know which I should use?
&gt; (2) thickness: 1.4,1.5 or 1.6 mm.  Same question here.  I guess I can measure
&gt; the edge of the old gasket to get this.
&gt; Finally, does anyone know the exact title and author of the Bentley manual
&gt; covering repairs in this vanagon?

I picked up the factory manual at a grage sale recently, and I'll give 
you the gist of what it says.  Bear in mind that it is for the 
&quot;mechanically enlightened&quot; (I am not.), so it is a little terse.

* piston height must be measured when installing new pistons or short 
block and head gasket selected.(sic)
it goes on to list to very expensive looking parts(from the pict.) for 
measuring Cylinder head  thickness.  I take that your are just replacing 
the head gasket and not the pistons so I will skip to Fig. 4 Sec. 15.9

Cylinder Head gasket identification:

Locate the part number on the gasket and use that.  Each gasket has a 
unique part number stamped on it.  If it is unreadeable, look at the edge 
of the gasket where the part number is stamped and there will be 1,2,or 3 
notches there.  listed below are the part numbers for the various notches.

1 notch --- 068 103 383L
2 notch --- 068 103 383M
3 notch --- 068 103 383N

&gt; Thanks for your help and suggestions!
&gt; Also, if you have suggestions and tips for replacing this head gasket, I would
&gt; love to hear them.

Some Misc. tips from the manual:

Head can be removed and installed with engine in car.

Before working on head, remove injectors and glow plugs.

Every time head is removed, chlinder head bolts must be retroqued, and 
again after about 100 miles as described above.

marking OBEN on gasket MUST face cylinder head.

Lemme know if you need the torque sequence and such.  It's pretty lengthy 
and ivolved.  more so than some of the Detroit monsters I worked on years 
ago.

                          
                               Later,
                                    Brad
