Subject: alternator not OK :(

Hey all,
Well, I thought that replacing the belt fixed it.  But no.  This
morning, I went out to start it up and there's that nasty metal-to-metal
noise again.  I think now it's getting worse.  As it warms up the
metal-to-metal noise goes away to be replaced by a new high-pitched
whine that is proportional in loudness to engine rpm.

Luckily my spare alternator will be arriving shortly.  I'l lbe sure to
keep it in the van at all times!  

Sean
