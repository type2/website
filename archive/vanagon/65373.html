Bill,

I found the same thing about my westy insurance with state farm. I drove
it by for them to see and later recieve a refund check for about half of
my premium.   It works in TN.  Got to love a VW

&gt; A recent post about the Rialta stated that one of its advantages was that
&gt; it could be insured as an RV.
&gt;
&gt; I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be insured
&gt; as an RV (at least with State Farm).  My insurance on the '84 Westy is
&gt; about half of what it is for my '86 Jetta.  Many years ago, in
&gt; California, the requirements for RV insurance were that it had to have a
&gt; bed, a sink, and a stove.  Here in North Carolina, the agent just
&gt; processed the RV application without telling me the details.
