Subject: Re: Bosch distributor #


&gt;My '69 (1600 DP) has a Bosch 009 that I've never been to happy with. Can
&gt;someone give me the  Bosch number of the vacuum advance type distributor. A
&gt;friend can order the part wholesale but doesn't know which part I need.

I'm told these are no longer manufactured? If I'm told wrong and you find
out the part number, will you get me one if I send the money?
