Subject: Re: Duplicate postings - me or you?


&gt; Are all of the duplicate posts from the vanagon list?

Yup. I'm on the vanagon list ONLY. I just got my second copy of a post
from Harvey Chao (no offense, Harvey, I think these duplications are
random, and you happened to be there when one happened), both of which
were sent to me by vanagon.

BTW, Harvey also sent me a copy directly, so I have received this post
three times. But I should have received it only twice-- one from him
directly, and one from his post to the vanagon list.
