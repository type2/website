Subject: Last Call: Bus Rolling Chassis in Pa for $50

I am finally sending these 2 parts busses to the crusher this 
weekend.  Both have no engine, drivetrain, or interior, and some 
windows are removed. They have good axle beams, brake parts, 
suspensions, etc.  The '76 actually has relatively little rust all 
around. If anyone could use a bus axle beam, etc., you can take the 
whole bus on a towbar for $50.00 or trade me almost anything 
useful.  But you must do it this weekend.
The busses are between Philadelphia and Reading, Pa.
