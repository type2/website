Subject:      Starting and idle problems

Hey. This morning my 84 wasserboxer had a hard time starting
Almost drained the battery.
when it started in went out again once I gave a little gas. Also when I
started in 1st. gear and did not speed up a lot before releaving the
clutch.

There were 3 or four little &quot;farts&quot; from the exhaustpipe. Small
explosions.
When idle it went out. After it got hot it didn't.

What is this?
Moist in the electric system. lack of compression, old sparkplugs,
platins, too low idle rpm.?

Thanks in advance nice people

Knud from Denmark
