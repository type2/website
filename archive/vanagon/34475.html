Subject: Boxer....

	Its the frequent rebuilds that our little engines require-
the short blocks lie arond all over the FLAPS and get refered to as
Boxer Shorts.... 

	:)

	Ok, so it was pretty weak! Anyway, not just flat German designs
but some flat Italian designs are refered to as Boxers too. The derivation
is abosolutely from the pugalist-like motions of the pistons. For example,
the Ferarri 512 Berlinetta Boxer or BB. 

	Note that there are two ways to do a horizontally opposed engine-
(at least!), the Boxer design we have enjoys separate crank-throws
for each cylinder (And five crank bearings for four cylinders); while a 
180 degree V has paired rods on a single crank and three crank bearings.
180 degree V pistons don't box, they sorta slosh back and forth
like the bass lines in those new-age songs KKSF plays :)

	So a Boxer is a flat engine, but a flat engine isn't
neccesarily a boxer...

	At least I THINK this is right :) 

	Bill
