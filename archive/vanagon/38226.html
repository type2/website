Subject: 1985 Weekender - Won't start warm

I am a new owner of a 1985, which I have so far been pleased with.

Unfortunatly, it started acting up yesterday.  The symptoms are as
follows.  Runs fine, although if left idling too long (a couple of 
minutes at a light) it seems to want to die.

The big problem is if it does die, it refuses to restart.  It turns 
over fine, but won't start.  Back to the basics, that seems to leave 
two things :spark or fuel.  Spark doesn't seem to be the problem, since
it runs most of the time, except after dieing (it will restart after a 
couple of hours.)

    So, I tend to think it must be something with the fuel supply when 
it's warm.  Unfortunatly, I don't have a clear enough understanding of 
how all the parts work together, to take a guess if it is a computer 
problem, sensor problem, or a minor adjustment of a turn of a screw.

Any ideas?

thank you,
