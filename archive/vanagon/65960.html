     On a recent trip to the UP of Michigan, my syncro started leaking
     anti-freeze from the front end (spare tire). This has never happened
     before.  Has anyone else had this problem???

                Condition: Syncro was climbing a 7% grade with rpm's at
                           3200-3500 in 3rd gear sometimes 2nd (30-35mph)
                           for approx. 2 miles.

                Solution:  We went on a hike.  When we returned the Syncro
                           had cooled down and the leaking stopped.  I
                           added some anti-freeze and we drove home
                           (_at_200miles at highway speed) with no
                           problems.

     If you can help out I'd appreciate it.  The fall colors are turning
     here in the upper-midwest and we plan on several trips.

     Thanks,

     Jim Spevacek
