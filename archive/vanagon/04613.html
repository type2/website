Subject: '72, dog of a year

I had a 72 westy for 17 years and I always considered it a dog of a year. 

You had the horrible combination of the first year of the type IV motor, but
it was little larger than the beetle motor in the 71 and earlier motors.
while the later busses had those nice 2.0 litre motors. Meanwhile, the type
IV motors cost double the beetle motors that 71 busses had. 

And to kick me in the shins, the engine could only be accessed from the rear
instead of the top like later 70s era busssses. It made it a pain and near
impossible to work on the carbs, which always seemed to need work.
