&gt; There was a great story in Fine Homebuilding a couple of 
&gt; years ago about a guy who bought a sander to remove paint from his house
&gt; and traded it in FIVE TIMES before the job was done. 

Be forwarned that Sears power tools no longer have this nice warrantee.
I think they all have the standard 90 days/no abuse warrantee.

Only the non-powered hand tools that say Craftsman are replaced 
unconditionally.
