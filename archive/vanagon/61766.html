Subject: Vanagon Sliding Door Latch (open position)

Did I see something a long time ago about VW repairing (for free) the
sliding door latch that keep the door in the open position?  Our just bit
the dust.  It looks like the spring is out of where it's supposed to be. 
Has anyone had experience fixing these?  Is it difficult?

TIA
