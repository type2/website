&gt; &gt;Let's not blame the politicians or the auto makers completely.  We must first
&gt; &gt;ask why a small child was sitting in the front seat to begin with?  Even
&gt; &gt;withiut air bags, children should not sit up front.  Many states even have
&gt; &gt;laws restricting children to the back seat.  A one year old should be in a
&gt; &gt;safety seat mounted in the center of the rear seat.  This is the safest place
&gt; &gt;to be.  In this location, accident would have to extremeley bad for child to
&gt; &gt;get hurt.  Think about it.

&gt; In Russia (&amp; I'm sure many other countrys) it is a *serious* offense to put
&gt; a 'small person' in the front seat - very expensive fine  (but they're so
&gt; politically incorrect that drivers who have been convicted of any sort of
&gt; DUI have to display a special license plate that designates what kind of
&gt; driver they are).
&gt; 
You're kidding right? How this be politically incorrect? I think it's 
a great idea! Ooops... Am I revealing something here?.. ;)
