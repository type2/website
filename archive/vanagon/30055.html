Subject: All the newcomer advice... Thanks!

Hi all!

Thanks for all of the advice. A couple of messages said that more info would 
help, so here goes...

The '86 has an ugly interior, the engine is kind of pitted, the body scratchy 
(as said) and needs a muffler big time. Guy wants $1950. The '71 is still an 
unknown - haven't been able to see it yet; it's located in Western New York. 
Renovated interior, a couple of rust spots on body (I got a very detailed 
description and it sounds acceptable), good pop-top, rebuilt engine; this is 
all, however, the word of the fellow selling it. He wants $1100. Says the 
beast is stupid cold, but drives great. 

Most of the advice has been to go for the '71... This will depend on a closer 
inspection of course (I intend to have a mechanic go over whichever one I'm 
going for before I make any final deal), but I'm leaning that way myself. 
Thanks for all the good advice on heat - now that I think of it, I was able 
to get plenty of heat out of the exchangers on my '75 Beetle (with '74 
engine) once I replaced them... 

I will, of course, inform everybody if and when a purchase is made. Are 
cigars appropriate?

Thanks again, and please, if you have any more advice, keep it coming.

Peace,

Anton
