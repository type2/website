&gt;Well people, is there anyway to drain oil without using the drain plug?
&gt;Mine was hopelessly buggered and I just broke the Easy Out in the thing
&gt;(after all that drilling upside down).

ok. first you get a replacement drain plug. then you get some metal chisels
(sharp, small ones) and files ... and you slowly reshape the drain plug to
be roughly hex-shaped again (but it will be smaller than before) so you can
get a socket on it.  a little dremel motor-tool might be helpful here.
it's slow tedious work, but it can be done.
