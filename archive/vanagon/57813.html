&gt; &gt; ------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; We've seen a few EV Westie Weekenders here in St. Paul, too.
&gt; When we lived in Vancouver in 1995 we saw scads of EV Westies with
&gt; _full_ camping gear.
&gt; I friend of ours let us borrow his '92 DIESEL powered EV Westie. I think
&gt; it had 78 hp! It was 
&gt; slow going over the mountians... We loved it, and would have bought one
&gt; ourselves (gas powered, 
&gt; though) except that we were moving back to the US, buying a house, and
&gt; getting married. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We were told that VWoA did not import any of the full Westfalia EV
&gt; conversions because of the
&gt; exchange rate, and the VW of Canada was discontinuing their Westie
&gt; conversions for the same reason. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does VWoA Care? Or was the Westie market so small that they could walk
&gt; away from it? Do they think 
&gt; people who would have bought an EV Westie will buy a bigger, more
&gt; expensive EV Winnebago? 

	I'm only guessing based on what I see in the market........but, I think
VWofA wanted a more elaborate camper
	with a furnace, more plumbing (gray-water sump, exterior wash etc.) and
Franz Noble (the Westy contractor) wasn't
	ready to support that. Also, I think VW wanted to have the Eurovan frame
available with larger camper bodies. So,
	Winnebago was a logical supplier for both styles, the Eurobago and the
Rialto. 

	I know that the (3) items I missed most with my '91 Westy was a sump for
cooking anywhere, a furnace for year-round
	lounging and an auxiliary battery. The Eurobago has all of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I think they blew it.

	Well, It's seems they opted to not go after the market looking for
smaller, less elaborate campers. But, I paid $24.4K for
	my '91 Campmobile. Today, an equivalent Eurobago would probably be ~$27K..
Would a significant number of buyers pay
	15&gt;20% more for more comfort? I think so.
