              R!

Hi Louise,

&gt; Dave Easterwood and I were discussing the possibility of manufacturing
&gt; custom jalousied windows for vanagons. Would any of you be interested?

Count me in as an interested party. On a side note, Chris Turner
(JordanVW_at_aol_dot_com) recently mentioned that he has seen two tasteful
installs of breadloaf jalousie windows to vanagons. Chris, care to
elaborate?

&gt;
&gt; and....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Question #3:
&gt; Has anyone retrofitted the top canvas to reinstate the side triangular
&gt; windows as are in my 72?

I know that VW Canvas in Texas does custom work. There awning price as $160
was very reasonable. Maybe they would be a good candidate for such a job?
