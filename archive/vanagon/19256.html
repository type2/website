Subject: One of The Unknowns

Let me introduce myself.  I have been reading all your postings for 3 months
now, and I started feeling guilty about being one of the &quot;Unknowns&quot; so I
thought I'd tell you all my story.  I am the proud owner of a 1966 deluxe
Micro.  I am the second owner and up till six months ago there had been no
damage.  Only slight rust around the windows.  It was a beauty.  A fresh coat
of paint.  all new rubber.  (21 windows and 5 doors that is a lot of rubber
$800)  My pride and joy my first vehicle.     

Well all good things must come to an end.  On superbowl sunday this year I
recieved a call from the apholstery shop, that was putting in a new top and
headlner,  informing me that my bus had been stolen.   I was crushed.  

The little man at the apholstery shop admitted he was liable and that he felt
he owed me a $9,000 Micro.  He talked a good game.  He promised much and did
nothing.  

When I mentioned &quot;Court&quot;  He put his ear to the gangster network and
discovered that one of his customers had stolen the Micro.  

Well to make a six month story short.  I got the bus back and it was stripped.
 No engine with a total of 9miles on it (1776)I had just rebuilt it, no
bumpers (which I had just chromed),  no front door windows &amp; two popouts(also
chromed) the Rag was cut up as was the new headliner.  the new paint was
scratched,  it was lowered (only in the back.  Is this the new trend in
Micro's?) and the one that bugs me the most.   It had its numbers removed. 
The idiot cut out the whole piece out in the engine compartment.  Took the
metal tags and the plates. All totaled $3,000. in parts Not to mention Labor. 

The little man decided that this was enough on his part.  He told me that he
wasn't responsible.  He told me to just get it off his lot and that I should
be happy and greatfull.     I found out that he wouldn't be held liable for
the repairs unless I could prove negligence on his part.  I probably could do
this with the fact that I told him it was a target (at least here in So.
Cal.),  and that he needed to park something in front of it.  (he did this, 
till the last night suposedly) he has no money so I don't know.

So now it sits in the driveway.  No numbers no nothing.  It is not even
considered a vehicle.  It is a big green box on wheels.  

The next step is deciding  what to do with it.  Anybody interested?  Any
suggestions? Any donations?  Any spare parts?

Thanks for letting me let this out.  If you want to know where not to take
your vehicle just ask me, annother dissatisfyed customer.
