Gary/'76 Camper: just that day turned 1000 miles on new GEX engine and 
did 1st oil change, valve adjust., head tourqe.  Showed off new pop-top 
seal, sink faucet, &amp; pointed out mystery silver socket.

  is this where the never-seen folding table goes?

Scott Hoover/'76 Bus: Originally green, this bus is now a light turquoise 
blue and looks nice.  Since my Camper is a '76, Scott and I enjoyed 
seeing another bus of the same year.

  Do you or Scott have the never-seen table??? Any chance I could get
  its dimensions to try and fabricate a replacement???
