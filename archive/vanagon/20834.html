Subject: Re: Any Musicians = Wild Brass Band


&gt;Have any other wind players had the courage or gall to strike up the
&gt;band at a campsite?
&gt;
Hello!
Well=8A  I'm a Pppppper-Cu-SsioNNNN-Nist, and play in a band called the Seed
&amp; Feed Marching Abominables. We are a wild and crazy group of musical
revelers who bring the explosive sounds of big band and Sousa brass along
with thundering drums to the unexpected! My '72 westy is kind of the &quot;Band
Bus&quot; and has been known to house all kinds of musicians and instruments
from time to time. Once we played at a 50th wedding anniverary while we all
stood in the swimming pool. Another time, we &quot;blitzed&quot; (played
unsuspectingly to/at) the local laundramat. Somehow, the dryers seemed to
keep time with their whompa..whompa,;;whompa... We all meet at a designated
time, and depending on if we've got enough instruments in each section,
we'll all pile in the bus and drive up to some unsuspecting place, all pile
out and blast them with a song or two. A Guerrilla band at its best. It's
even better if we can play for beer! We even blitzed a transvestite bar
(mmmmm=8A=8A=8A=8A=8A) but they *loved* us! And let me tell ya honey=8A they=
 can dress.
(Course they all coveted my fabulous band jacket.)

        Anyway, I always have lots of percussion instruments stashed all
over, plus drumsticks. Once at a cookout, I started just tapping out a beat
on a cooler, and before I knew it every one had brought their coolers over
and arranged them in a trap-cooler set (not quite Mickey Hart-but you get
the picture). They actually sounded really good, with varying tones,
because they all had different levels of water and stuff in them, so I had
a great tonal range.. Tom-tom coolers. It was great.

        Besides that, there usually is also a madolin, and a guitar, both
of which find a comfy home in the top-cot. I also have Glow-in-the dark
stick on star constellations stuck to the inside of the pop-top.

        I also TORE my perfect upholstery on the back bed with the snare
holder on the bottom of the drum DOH!.  I hear tell that they don't even
make that ochre-ish color upholstery material anymore,,,so if one-a youse
has got some extra material, please let me know.

Also my '72 Westy is named &quot;The Villa&quot;  but more freakquently referred to
as &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;
