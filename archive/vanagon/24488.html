Subject: Some info on my 'new' '80 Vanagon?

Anyone know of a shop called VERI in San Rafael?  They did a lot of the
work on this Van.  I looked over some reciepts that were in it from '93
and '94, and it looks like it got a GEX rebuild 2 years ago ($1,600).  And
new rotors, calipers and new speedometer a month later ($700).  I figure
the engine has a FI problem, but should only have about 10,000 miles on
it.  So I was wondering how I might go about trouble shooting it?  Is
there a good FAQ on FI for a carb kinda guy? 

The problem is it's running rich, and seems to lack power (don't all buses?).
It seems like a lot of people find the O2 sensor at fault, it was 
replaced a year ago (are they really $95?), and when I disconnected it... 
there was no change.  Should there have been?  Anyway, I'd like to get 
this thing running before I get rid of it... kinda like a challenge.

My previous offer of $700 OBO still stands.  I just don't want it.  I 
posted an updated forsale ad to aircldvw.
