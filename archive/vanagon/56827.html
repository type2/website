&gt;    * These tires have diameters smaller/larger than original
&gt;      You will see speedometer/odometer errors

My experience with the 27x8.50R14 BFGoodrich Radial All Terrains is that they
actually eliminated my odometer error.  Previously my smaller tires over
estimated distances.  Now whenever I measure my odometer against the highway
odometer check signs I'm off my .05 miles or less over 5 miles of
measurement.  That's about 1% or less from actual.
