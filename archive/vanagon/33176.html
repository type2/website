As usual I have not seen these, nor do I know the owners, operators, or
mechanics of these vehicles.  Unless otherwise mentioned area code (512)

1969 VW BUS. Camper van
w/bed icebox, table, closets,
Original upholstery and wood
interior.  Needs new distributor
and carburetor to run. $500
obo. 445-5996

1988 VOLKSWAGON VANAGON
95k, excellent condition,
bed, curtains... $9500
302-3933
(This must be a weekender, or a Westy or something)

1971 VW CAMPER Bus with
bed, table, curtains, etc.
Almost completely restored
$3000 OBO 832-8758

Also an '84 Jetta, and a '92 Cabriolet email me for the listings on
these.  If someone wants, I can look at these for you on the weekend. I
would ask that you contact the owner first before contacting me.

Cheers,

David
