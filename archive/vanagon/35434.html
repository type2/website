&gt;&gt;Just as a warning, I'd unload that thing quick.  The auto trannies are

&gt;
&gt;Is this advice sound? 
&gt;
&gt;All advice eagerly accepted as I am just about to sell the beloved F100 
&gt;and I would hate to make a mistake.

&gt;Thanks.

&gt;From my personal experience I'd have to disagree.  My wife's 88 Vanagon has
over 105,000 miles without touching the automatic transmission - except to
replace the fluid once at around 100,000 miles (I know I should have replaced
it sooner).
