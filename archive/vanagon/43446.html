&gt;Whats interesting, is I saw 25hp dist caps last weekend for sale, for $10
&gt;each, which is a bargain.  I picked one up and looked inside, and it only
&gt;had 2 of the 4 spark plug contacts for the rotor!  I asked the guy what
&gt;the deal was, and he said it was for some sort of industrial motor.  Anyone
&gt;ever heard of these?
&gt;
Yes, it's for an air compressor
