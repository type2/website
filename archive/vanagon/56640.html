Subject: CCC's vote results


Thanks all of you who voted yesterday.  I've by now heard from the
majority of attendees to the 3/12-24 CCC's camping trip, so we don't
need to keep the polls open any longer.  Nice try, those of you
who tried to vote early and often, having your dog vote, trying
more than one vote per car, or voting when you don't plan to attend
this event, cuz you're on the other side of the country.  ;)

Anyway, the results, by nearly 2 to 1 is Pinnacles.  Sorry, those
of you who voted for Panamint.  Perhaps we can do a trip there in
the future.  BTW, this is Pinnacles not far from Monterey, not
the one near China Lake.  More details on it will be forthcoming.
I believe they do have space for us, plus in a group campground,
and showers, etc., which will be nice.  It is about 28 miles
south of Hollister, I think.  More coming on that.

Thanks again...
