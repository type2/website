Subject: Clutch pedal doesn't return?

I'm looking at a bus, trying to decide if I should buy.  I noticed
that the clutch pedal doesn't return to its normal position, but rests
about 1&quot; or 1-1/2&quot; below where it should be.  You can lift it the rest
of the way up w/ yer toe, but then it falls right back down again.
The bus drives and shifts pretty well, easier than some others I've
test-driven recently, but this worries me a little.  Anyone know the
cause, and what kind of repair ($$$) is involved?  Bus is a '78.

Thanks,

P.S.  I live in NJ.  Two weeks ago, I was in Seattle for a few days.
I don't understand why people complain about &quot;Seattle rustbuckets&quot;.  I
saw *lots* of buses and vanagons and they all looked to be in very
good or excellent shape from the outside.  I got a closeup look at a
'79 w/ sunroof, and it was PRISTINE.  Here on the East Coast, I
haven't seen a bus that clean in 10 years!  Over Christmas, we took a
trip NJ -&gt; NC -&gt; NJ, and in 18 hours of driving on I-95, I saw exactly
3 Vanagons and 1 Bus on the road.  VW Wasteland!  I saw that many in
each trip from exit 13 to exit 17 on I-90 in Seattle--about 5 miles!
What are you all out there complaining about???

Anyway, my main question is about the clutch...
