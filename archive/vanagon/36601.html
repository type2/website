Subject:       RE: how many? &amp; the light. bulb (F)

&gt; Hey, guess what... I just found out that a newer, larger bulb, made by
&gt; a completely different company, fits in the same socket as the original.
&gt; Has LOTS more power, too.    :^)

Steve!  Do you have a different engine in your Vanagon?   I'd like to 
know more.


&lt;HaHa&gt;  Just a little Friday humor there, and a little good-natured 
ribbing since we hear about said V6anaon _quite_ frequently! =)


Just kidding of course.  As a past owner of a Chevy Citation, I can't 
help take out some of my aggression towards that car by harassing 
current owners of the same engine!

Help me!  I've become bitter, and I can't get up!

It is hard for me to even discuss said Citation vehicle.  It was a 
source of much trauma in my early (pre-VW) high school years.

But then after I saw the light, and some sucker bought it!  What's 
that motto: caveat emptor! ... or is that the mottor for the Eurovan? 
&lt;grin&gt;

Ok, I think I'm digging a hole with too many list members with this 
message, so I'll shut up now!
