Subject: Re: Sliding door?

&gt;How do I go about lubricating the sliding door?  And what sort of stuff
&gt;should I use to do it?

Ron I had a problem with my sliding door when we were back in BC (after
Inuvik). It wouldn't close. I used axle grease from Jack and something
else. The damned thing still wouldn't close, it would just bounce back as
if somebody's (insensitive) finger were stuck in there.

Then I gave it a shot of WD-40.

It's been fine ever since.

Neil
