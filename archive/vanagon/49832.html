Subject: Parting out '81 Vanagon L

I am parting out an '81 Vanagon L in Denver. The motor, trans, 
parklights, and sliding door handle have already been sold to other list 
members, but almost everything else is still there. Please let me know 
if there is anything you need- large or small. I pay storage for the vna 
every month, so I would love to get rid of it. All the parts are 
original German, fairly priced, and guaranteed good.
TIA,
Josh
