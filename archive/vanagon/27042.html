Here is another idea for those unsuspecting tailgators:

You all remember the guy who used a pair of binoculars to take a horse
out of a race? The binoculars had concealed inside of them a device that
could generate a narrow sonic pulse that could knock a horse out of a
race.  Well what I am envisioning is a similar device, only generating
an electrical impulse sufficient enough to disable the ECM, or
distributor/coil mechanism which ever is present. To generate enough
electricity for the device you would only need to take the concept of
the sparkplug and make it bigger.  What you have is an electrical
discharge crossing a gap, in this case from the discharging unit, to the
ECM in the following vehicle(usually no more than 5 feet). The power
will be created by the generator/alternator. If you all recall our
gen/alt thread from a month or so ago we reckoned that the gen/alt
produces a current the entire time it is running. The job of the voltage
regulator decides whether or not to let the current through to the
battery, or let it dissipate as heat. Well when the regulator is not
allowing the battery to be charged, the excess is routed into the
discharge unit storing it until needed.

If feels like friday, except I know that I have to work tomorrow. Oh
well,

David
