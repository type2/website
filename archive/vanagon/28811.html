In a message dated 95-11-13 15:38:00 EST, you write:

&gt;
&gt;The coolant temperature warning light sometimes flashes when the gauge 
&gt;needle is showing max temp, and sometimes when the needle shows normal temp.

I've had this happen - the coolent level in the &quot;main holding tank - where
the sensor is located&quot; is low.  If the sensor doesn't &quot;see&quot; any liquid then
the light flashes requardless of temp.
