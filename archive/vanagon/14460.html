Subject: redrock trip report


A few of you have requested that I post my red rock trip report, since my 
previous comments to this end have been just that - sniveling dribbles and 
droves of analytical judgments, dotted with some satirical, cynical and/or 
ironic if not irreverent observations.  As I consider myself basically an 
onlooker with occasional detached curiosity, I'm not the best person to give a 
blow by blow account about what we did this hour and that day, etc.  Rather, my 
feeling about the trip can be written as in an e-mail thread I was having with 
Bill Abbott recently, when I set about trying to explain to him just what he 
had missed on this momentous occasion, and why it would have so pleased him.

You've already heard about the specific logistics that occurred on the 
adventure:  gourmet cooking, showers, off-roading, substance-abuse, ceremonious 
bonfires, etc.  What's hard to depict to the rest of the list that couldn't 
make it there is the intangible:  there is in this group (and I suspect it is 
somewhat rare) a certain sense of camaraderie stemming from another era - it's 
a communal binding thread without a name.  For some of us, it is the chance to 
relive the hippie/vw-bus-thing we may have missed in the 60s or 70s.  Some may 
have even lived it when it happened, or come in for part of that era, but there 
was the sense then (and at these gatherings) that &quot;this is what is relevant, 
where things are happening, we see the world as it is, and can make a 
difference in it.&quot;  We are the here and now, it was then and now, and here, and 
it resides in abundance in this group, although its essence is fleeting and not 
capturable.  It is youth, vitality, reversal, truth.  

I will probably never fully understand why this ideology became so strongly 
synonymous with VW ownership.  If asked what the truly &quot;politically correct&quot; 
car was, I'd have to answer something like:  vw, subaru, volvo - even though 
the term is in itself a classic oxymoron, a contradiction in terms.  
Nevertheless, for those of us who HAVE to drive, or simply can't resist, owning 
a vw van is possessing a piece of culture.  It is a tie from the past to the 
present to the future.

That culture may be philosophical for one person, musical for another, 
ideological politically for a third, or simply pure delight in the overt 
rebellion of what started out as a simple air-cooled &quot;car for the people,&quot; of 
the people, and by the people for the rest of us.  There's the identification 
with German engineering (don't we all like SOMETHING about porsches, bmw, 
audis, mbz?) - that business of the feel of the road- that no b.s. handling.  
How many of us would be caught dead saying we liked the buttery-soft cushy 
suspension of an automatic lexus, huh?  With the vw, you get honesty and 
integrity, and feel the road as it is and was meant to be felt - a humbling and 
real experience.  The pothole is there because it &quot;is.&quot;  Or cars don't insult 
us by trying to minimize the fact.  Similarly, it didn't matter that my shower 
failed miserably - the cleansing part of it was that everyone sympathized with 
my goal to have one, and were rooting, cheering, teasing, etc.  We like to have 
clean hair just as much as we take pride in our oil changes, tune-ups, 
valve-adjustments, and engine rebuilds  :)   

So it is with these camp outs/bashes/gatherings.  While each of us allows and 
tolerates the others to be independent and individual, there is this common 
philosophy about lack of pretense, no conspicuous consumption and no 
ostentatiousness that makes us all get along very well together. In both 
nerd-geek and vw terms, WYSIWYG, and there is immense comfort in that security. 
 Is it not after all the important thing about friendships and connections - 
that the basic underlying common philosophy should click, despite surface 
differences?  The irregularities are the ornament that make the experience 
savory.  It is precisely why you didn't &quot;have to be there&quot; to appreciate why 
the prune thing was so bizarrely funny.  We all understand this because the 
comprehension already resides within us in our bond, and that's why we all get 
along so well, and can't wait to see each other again.  

What else can I say?  &quot;Nothing else is a VW?&quot;  Face it:  there's some 
something in all of us that's a little bit out to lunch, but we take pride in 
being able to exist out there on that plain!  

I look forward to many, many more of these gatherings in future years....
