Subject:  friends of Jesus in a chartreuse Microbus

&gt;&gt; &quot;..and eleven long haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse Microbus.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you don't remember, your bus is older than you are.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Indeed, my bus is almost as old as I am.  But this I don't remember, why
&gt;don't you enlighten me?

        From C.W. McCall's runaway 70's CB hit song &quot;Convoy&quot;. And the
resulting Kris Kristofferson movie based on same. Or song based on movie
- - -

this reminds me of a bus i found in a junkyard a couple years ago,  a white
and light blue combi , circa 1960 bj.,   with &quot;Jesus loves you&quot;   etc.
written all over it.   It had sunk into the dirt up to its axle nuts, and
probably had been there since the seventies.

too bad the junkyard guy was such a *&amp;_at_hole.   his uncle had had theplace for
decades,  but was retired now.  (there were some thirties cars there)   The
current guy was waiting for him to die so he could scrap all the junkers.
   In the same yard was a few other buses, including a 58 panel with cab
divder, nice floor mat, decklid, and - rear bumper -.     I would have pulled
the shift linkage out too, if i had realised how people want them.   but im
sure it's all squashed now.    lotsa bullet holes there, too.
