Norm...
ok, I've got to admit that I'm a &quot;girlyman&quot; when it comes to changing the 
oil on my EV...but the local dealer has these cupons and will do it for $16 
including filter...I drop off the EV with a case of Mobil1...and tell them 
to keep their oil....it works out about $4 for the labor (considering the 
filter is approx. $12...)

I have a set of brake pads sitting in the rear compartment of the EV...one 
of these days I'm going to change them...let me know how you make out!
