Hi all,

Another question...
I am discovering that I can't keep affording to send my 85 Vanagon out
to the local VW mech to keep it up properly, so I am going to have to
re-discover the joys (I always did love busted knuckles) of doing your
self stuff. I have seen a couple of people mention &quot;Muir&quot; manuals and
some mention of &quot;Bentley's&quot;  I went hunting around and couldn't find
anything around here for my van (did get to see a Bentley Manual for
Golfs though and it seemed to be an ok book (didn't have much about
the body - seemed to be mostly about the goodies under the hood).

Now, finally the question. What book do all of you on the list
recommend as the best all around book for the Vanagon. And next, what
book is a good one for under a zillion dollars (I expect the &quot;best one
to be way, way too expensive.)   8-)

And another question.  Where can I locate these books?

TIA,
Doug Skinner from Bowling Green, Kentucky
85 Vanagon GL
