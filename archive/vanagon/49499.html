Of cause I know, I'm born in Germany :-)
Profi's Vanagons are nice looking, mostly upgraded to Porsche six engines
and in total expensive vehicles. Because the Vanagon line ended, the
manufacturer Dehler continues to convert the EV line with the same outfit
as the Vanagons. One special feature in EV is the stretched Van. Inside
in the extension on the rear you will find the kitchen interior.
