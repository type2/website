Subject: Rebuilt or Re&quot;Buy&quot;?

There was a recent post stating that a rebuild for a 2 L bus engine should
run around $750 - $1200.  I've seen rebuilt (remanufactured) 2 L engines for
somewhere around $1300.  It so happens that I have a '77 westy with a 2 L that
needs rebuilding.  I plan on just pulling it apart and hopping it just has a
stuck valve or it needs new rings, but if a whole rebuild is needed, wouldn't
it be better to spend a little more and get a professionally rebuilt engine?
The one I will will be rebuilding has over 200,000 miles on it and I'm not sure
about how most of them were traveled.  I also would rather not get into 
rebuilding the lower end.  Does anyone have any experiance with rebuilt engines
from a catalog?  What do you get with them and how do they hold up?  
Any thoughts?
Brett

P.S.  How easily would this 2 L with fuel injection go into a '73 bus.  The
body on my '77 won't last forever and a engineless, rustless '73 may be in
my future.
