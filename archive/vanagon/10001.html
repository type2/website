Subject: Re: Purging Cooling System

Joel,

The reason I couldn't get coolant to bubble out of my radiator last night 
was obvious.  There wasn't enough in there.  That was rather an unhappy 
surprise.

I shut off the known-bad rear heater and hope that will hold the water.  
If it does, then maybe that's all it will take to fix it.  If it doesn't, 
then I imagine it's a head gasket problem.  The odd thing is, the coolant 
reservoir never shows low.  NEVER.  Apparently all the air migrates.

Now, if I'm loosing coolant (and I must be) where is it going?  I've 
found absolutely no leaks under the car anywhere.  None in the passenger 
compartment, either.  Does this mean it's being blown out the exhaust?

Anyone have any ideas on the cost of doing the head gaskets?  I'm way out 
of warranty.  Is an overhaul a likelihood?  I have 105k miles.  Car runs 
good.  I need to do this for the absolute bottom permisseable dollar.  
Farming is not profitable this year.  Low prices this year, no crop last 
year, you know.  With that in mind, is this something that can be done 
one's self, or is that a foolish risk for the average mechanic (I have 
rebuilt engines, but not this kind, and don't have lots of tools although 
I can get access to any except specialized VW tools.)
