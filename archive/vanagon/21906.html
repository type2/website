Subject: Re: Brake booster hose

&gt;Three days later Jim remembers part of his weekend:  Saturday I 
&gt;stopped at the local German car specialist and asked if they had the 
&gt;vacuum hose for the brake booster on my '71 bus.  He said they didn't.
&gt;He said I needed metal reinforced hose.  The regular stuff would 
&gt;collapse.  He said to check with the FLAPS.  So, I checked at the 
&gt;FLAPS.  He said what I needed was hydraulic line hose.  This comes in 
&gt;the size I need and is metal reinforced.  $3/ft.  Is this what we are 
&gt;after?  I haven't measured mine but this sure seems cheaper than the 
&gt;nearly $200 somebody said the dealer wanted for this thing.  Anybody 
&gt;else running some different with any success?  I am thinking this is 
&gt;what I will use to replace mine.  Thanks, Jim


I was looking for the right replacement hose a few weeks ago. After I
settled on the Gates power brake booster vacuum hose (no wire) (1/2&quot; id) and
had everything hooked up, the parts manager at my local vw dealership turned
me on to a better alternative:  Gates makes a wire reinforced coolant hose
with a 1/2&quot; id nicknamed &quot;shape to fit&quot; hose.  It goes for around $3 a foot.
It will not collapse.  I bought some, installed it and confirmed that my
power booster leaks.  Still looking for a cheap used working booster.  The
hydraulic hose idea sounds good if it's metal reinforced---anything that
won't collapse will work.
  
Has anyone noticed that the vent tube that comes off the front (FIF) of the
power booster (by the pushrod &amp; bellows) accomodates a 1/2&quot; id hose, but the
tube (that passes right  behind the driver's wheel--71 Bus) on the other end
of the hose is wider.  I had to use an adapter here.  Just curious if I'm
the only one with this situation.
