Here's one more likely suspect:

Check the operation of the throttle position switch.  It's supposed to close
at idle and near full throttle.  If it doesn't close near idle, the computer
won't put the system in idle control mode.  This would likely have an effect
(although not as pronounced) once the engine is warm also.
