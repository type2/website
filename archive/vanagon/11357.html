&gt;From: Sglw_at_aol_dot_com:
&gt;I would like to go on march 24-26 but feel that I may be out of place with my
&gt;70 westphalia that is terrible on the outside &amp; ok on the inside.
&gt; Are all the people there in immaculate restored Kombis? or are there a few
&gt;buses that need external work like mine?

Well, I'm planning to show up in a '69 with no paint and rust, and I
have no shame.  If the others don't like it, they can make me park across
the road.
