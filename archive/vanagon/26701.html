Subject: Westy back from hit and run

Kalypso is back (for a week now) from his accident.

His whole driver's rear corner was replaced form top to bumper. He got a
four wheel alignment. Driving him is great (except that the steering wheel
is now crooked--I'll have to pull it  and straighten it).

I had to pay my 500 dollar deductible (and the rental car--BTW, '95
Sunfires are not very impressive), as the other insurance company refused
to pay.

Why? Well, it seems that the owner's 14 year old daughter took Mom's keys
from an upstairs bedroom and went on a joyride with her 16 year old
unlicensed friend. Since said friend was the one who hit me (running away
frm the police in a car chase), he's responsible.The owner is not
responsible in any case--this was &quot;operating the car without the owner's
consent&quot; according to the insurance company.

Total bill was 2900 bucks, so my insurance did pay quite a bit (Allstate).
It just seems a lot for me to deal with for being asleep in my house. I
mean, I was not only not at fault, I wasn't even in the car!

Small claims court is the next step for me to recover my money.

In the end, all I know is that I'm glad to have Kalypso back. Between the
accident and transmission. I hadn't driven the Westy for a month.

It feels good.

Take Care,
Dave
