Subject: '56 kombi progress: Body work update


My bus is almost and the bodywork stage so I'm starting to pay attention 
to these particular discussions.

&gt;       ( the guide coat trick is where you spray on a contrasting color, and
&gt;then sand it down.  The low spots will show up because the paint won't
&gt;be sanded off.  )

Sorry for the novice questions, but when you say &quot;sand it down&quot;, how exactly
is that done.  Sand paper with hand, block sanding, random orbital?
Oh, and what grit does one use for this kinda exercise?

Thanks,
...Markus
