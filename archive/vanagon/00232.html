&gt; a reasonable cost.  Possibly a mass order for the Oettinger 2.5 liter parts
&gt; mentioned recently?
&gt; 

I'm also interested in beefing up the engine of my '87.  Its compression
is getting low (125 across the board), so it may soon be time to rebuild.
If you find out prices, send me some email.
