Thom,

I have a book that describes in detail how to convert a bubble or split 
window bus into a camper.  It's not a terribly large  book and I can 
xerox off copies (I don't have a scanner) and send them to you or anyone 
else that's interested.  There aren't any patterns, but lotsa sketches 
etc.  I think it's dated 1969 or 1970.
