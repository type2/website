Subject: Re: 84 vanagon camper

I don't know, but I'll cc the list on this reply and maybe someone can 
help you.  I just pulled my ac out, and I have NO idea what state my 
compressor is in.  I expect it's garbage.

&gt; hi there,
&gt; saw your posting on the group rec.autos.vw about the 85 camper that caught
&gt; fire.  what caught my eye was the listserver for vanagons.  i just sent in a
&gt; subscription.  i too have an 84 vanagon camper with 107,000.  just finished
&gt; installing a rebuilt engine and transmission.  the next task is to rebuild
&gt; the ac system.  do you know where i can get a rebuilt sanden compressor?  i
&gt; noticed in the workbook that the compressors may have had a later upgrade?
&gt;  i'm not sure yet what model compressor i have.  no time to take it out since
&gt; we're headed up to san onofre state beach for the 4th.
&gt; 
&gt; happy camping,
