&gt;Have you ever wanted to cover the cargo area in the back of your
&gt;Westphalia,  above the mattress? I get uncomfortable when I park with
&gt;something valuable sitting out in the open. I have the rear heater so under
&gt;the seat storage is limited.
&gt;
&gt;My wife Ingrid and I just built an inexpensive, light cover. It's no
&gt;protection if the car is broken into but, &quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot; We
&gt;built a square cover frame and legs out of PVC plumbing pipe. Ingrid found
&gt;a piece of fabric very close to the seat cover. That covered the top.
&gt;
&gt;Think of a square trampolene or card table shape, made out of PVC pipe with
&gt;a fabric top. A tube compartment is stiched into each side of the cloth.
&gt;The PVC pipe is threaded into the edges of the cloth and connected with
&gt;corner brackets. The contraption straddles the matress, making a large
&gt;hidden storage area.
&gt;
&gt;If you make one, connect the legs to the outer frame ring with &quot;T&quot;
&gt;fixtures. The cross of the &quot;T&quot; becomes part of the square frame ring. The
&gt;leg become the vertical part of the &quot;T.&quot; The legs will hinge to make a flat
&gt;unit for storage.
&gt;&quot;
&gt;You will need two ten foot lengths of pipe, four corner or &quot;L&quot; brackets,
&gt;four &quot;T &quot;joints, four end caps (feet for the legs.) I used 3/4 inch pipe.
&gt;If you havent worked with PVC pipe, you will find it easy. It cuts easily
&gt;with any kind of saw. It assembles just by pushing parts together.
&gt;Everything holds together by friction.
