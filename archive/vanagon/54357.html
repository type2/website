Subject: Need WWW space


Few month ago someone offered plenty of empty space
to host www pages. Yesterday I scanned a lot of
pictures about my engine swap and I like to start
transferring this and some HTML. I guess the full
description will end up with 5 to 7 MByte.

Who will offer me free empty WWW space?
