&gt;Subject: tips on assembling wing windows for a splittie

&gt;has anyone out there done this latly?  i am trying to use
&gt;new WCM glass to frame rubber, but am having a heck of a
&gt;time getting it to seat the last 1/4 inch.  it will not
&gt;budge.  also, how do you go about trimming the excess rubber
&gt;of behind the water catch.  any ideas would be greatly
&gt;apreciated.
&gt;thanks and God Bless

Matt,

When I have seen it done, the window frame has been set in a
vice (with wood contacting the frame and glass) and as the
vice is tightened, the glass/rubber is squeezed into
position.  I assume a similar wood clamp configuration would
replace a table-mounted vice.  Whatever method, the rubber
should be well lubricated and all pressure should be
distributed evenly over the edge of the glass.

As for trimming *back there* you should be able to position
the rubber so that (at least at that point) trimming is
unnecessary as you squeeze the glass/rubber into place.

Any other ideas anyone?
