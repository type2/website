Subject: 87 Westy FS in So Cal

I saw the following van at a local used car lot the other day:

1987 Vanagon GL
Westfalia interior with sink, refer, stove, cabinets (genuine Westfalia)
High roof design - not a Westfalia pop-top but a fixed high roof w/o a name
48,280 miles on the odometer
2&quot; receiver type trailer hitch
Alloy wheels
Power windows
Power locks
NO power mirrors
White color
Dometic awning
Manual transmission
Air conditioning

$14,988. on the window

Glendora Toyota (818)967-1435

Usual disclaimers apply.  I don't know the origin of this high roof top or
whats up there.  It did not have any name or logo on it.  The interior was
definitely Westfalia brand.  Maybe the pop-top was replaced by this high roof
thing or maybe this van was imported from somewhere where this was a
&quot;Factory&quot; westfalia product.
