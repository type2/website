Nope! not the new motor but in the '83 Vanagon 2.0L Westfalia. It's been a
real fun day. I had the typically longish description going on in my usual
&quot;VanBondo&quot; smart aleck tone when POOF! I recieved a
KERNAL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR and had to cold boot the sys and repair. I hear
they come in threes. Just checked with the Mrs. and at least she says that
she's not planning on laying any legal documents on me soon. WHEW! At least
I dodged that one for now. She just looked at me weird and said &quot;No why did
you ask THAT!?&quot;  Jus' checkin sweetie darling dear, jus' checkin... 8I

OK so the bottom line is that I thought that I was driving down the street
next to a vehicle with bad top end noise. I coudn't wait to get away from it
as it was driving me nuts. Institinctively I checked the idiot lights and
sniffed the air with the usual results. All appeared to be the norm until I
pulled into a parking lot to confirm my creeping, sinking feeling. Turned it
off ASAP as I had taught Mrs. VanBondo to do no questions asked. We call it
the &quot;Pro light drill.&quot;
RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!

Bum-mer! Checked the oil after a cool down (car and self). All OK and
proper. Thought I would try it again as if the &quot;dropped vavle seat&quot; fairies
would have done their magic just because I checked the oil. DUH! Called the
hook and a few wrenchers. I am just glad that it didn't happen 1/2 way
between one of the three immediate trips I have/had planned. Gotta get my
poop together to drive to the SOTO/Classic, Business in NM in late June, and
camp with some crazy Brit and family who's coming our way.

Pray to St. Pon for me until I get the rough news. =(
