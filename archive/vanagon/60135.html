      Have you decided where and when to meet at the Bug Out?  Our family has
a busy day that day and we are trying to fi everything in.
 
 Thanks,

I have recieved a couple different mails asking about where everybody wants
to meet for a &quot;listmember get together&quot; after my initial post about Manassas
Bug Out #38
next weekend.
Someone (John Anderson, I think) suggested we all meet at Ron's Swap meet
space.  That works for me. Let's say 1pm Sunday anyone who wants to put a
face with the names they have been e-mailing, meet at Ron's &quot;ice blue&quot;
colored (Dove blue)'89 Westy (blue poptop will most likely be popped up)....
the one with the nice freshly painted front fiberglass bumper and dirty Carat
wheels...  :&lt;)  (inside hint  :&lt;)
It will be in the vendors/swap area.
If there aren't any objections, then we'll all meet there at 1pm.

chris

chris,

     Have you decided where and when to meet at the Bug Out?  Our family has
a busy day that day and we are trying to fi everything in.

Thanks,
