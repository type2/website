So Gerald Skerbitz says:
&gt; 
&gt; Sure.  After tearing the whole thing apart, the switch was what was wrong 
&gt; the whole time.  It's suspicious, though.  The switch went bad because it 
&gt; got hot inside and melted.  Several of the switches in this van have had 
&gt; that happen to them....  I'm conjecturing that it was getting harder to 
&gt; turn the fan in the cold weather, so the current went up....???

About tearing head-long into the dash, I think, Gerry, that your venturing 
where no-one on this list has ever gone before.....  :)

However, I do agree that the fan motor drawing more current in the circuit 
could cause the weaker connections to burn out.  I'd consider replacing the 
the motor.  Don't know about the heater core.  Sorry.
