Have you considered that you may have been bucking a headwind on the start
of your journey, and had a tailwind to blow you home?

When I'm driving west on a long journey, the drive can get a little shaky
because I am driving into the wind.  We've all experienced the mix of a
strong wind and the Bus' handling characteristics.  But driving east, I get
blown all the way across the states, and my gas mileage is a lot better!
