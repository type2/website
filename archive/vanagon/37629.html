Subject: re: MOFOCO report

Hi All,

I just received my replacement parts from MOFOCO.  Or at least some of them.
They forgot to include the camshaft.  And the replacement oil cooler? 
Used.  I was very clear about ordering &quot;new, not rebuilt&quot;.  I stuck a Q-tip
inside the cooler and it came out with grit stuck to it.  Perhaps three's
the charm.

On a scarier note, this package arrived with not one, but two invoices. 
Mine, and some other gentleman's.  I now have this persons name, address,
telephone number, and credit card number with expiration date.    Perhaps
that dream vacation is now within reach...   :-)

Tom
