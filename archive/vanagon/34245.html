All,

For those that do not know, I have a 79 Westy which has had the FI
removed and a Weber Progressive added. This morning it was a balmy 29F
degrees here in sunny Texas, and as can be expected, the bus ran crappy.
The carb has what I would believe to be some sort of breather hose
running from the base of the air-cleaner to a plastic box type thing
ontop of the fan housing.  Having removed this thing a couple of times
to look down the opening I am thinking that this is forcing cold air
into the carb. What I am wondering is, can I get a &quot;Y&quot; fitting, and
splice it into the hose, and get some other tubing and run it to an
opening in the engine tin for preheat?  This hose does not make an air
tight connection as it is now, so I wouldn't think that this would cause
any problem with extra intake.  In fact I would think that the air being
forced through their now would cause a vacuum type effect with the
second hose, and draw more warm air up through this makeshift preheat
hose.  What does the collective think?

Cheers,

David
