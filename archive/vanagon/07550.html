Subject: Change Coolent--Fry Motor

A fellow I know in Connecticut ruined his motor because he changed the
coolent and left some air in the system but didn't know it and used the car
to go to the store. The motor overheated and he had to replace the engine. He
said this happened because he didn't know to raise the front of the vehicle
before changing the coolent.

A mechanic I know claims this is not a problem on 86 and up vans.
