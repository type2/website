Subject: Diesel vanagon heat

 
Appreciated the great ***flame*** war on levers this week - did
a great job of putting me behind on my work schedule  :-)

I seem to remember it originating in someone posting that they 
had marginal heat in their diesel Vanagon (hereafter dV):

for the record, my 83 dV keeps up as well as my other watercooled
VWs/Audis - this in the balmy central NY (Finger lakes) region - coming
off the second coldest winter to date, Think we had two months straight
of below freezing temps - and a bone-chilling couple of nights at
25-30 below 0 F!!

Old faithful (white top on blue body) never failed to start - accompanied
by a belching of blue smoke for a couple of minutes - but very driveable
after warming up.  The heater (i only have the front heater :-(

would bring the cabin up to about 50F int his climate - which isnt 
toasty but is really beyond the call of duty for this weather imho.

I have a diesel burning aux heater which i never have gotten to work -
yes, its the one withthe timer s you can send the kids out to warm up
the car body before you go to work, i tracked the fault down to the
flame switch, but as they cost $300 at VW I want ot get some 
resistance specs before i pretend to work for the VW dealer (thinly
disguised dig at delaer mechanics who usually play swap parts charade
with you bank account as leverage)

Joel &quot;I got it all here on fiche&quot; Walker got me the fiche and a manual
****Thanks J !!*****  that got me started on this; i promised myself
i would get it fixed last winter but .......

Anyone ever measured the cold or hot resistance of the flame switch
on their (gas or diesel) heater ??

email back (ss76_at_cornell_dot_edu) would be least abusive of BW as this
is a relatively obscure one methinks .

TIA, sps
