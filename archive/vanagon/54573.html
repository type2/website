Paul;
Buy an anti-freeze tester for the type of coolant you are using i.e. a
regular tester will not work on Seira brand. Then check the protection
offered by the mixture in your vehicle. You should be able to figure out
how much you need to drain and replace  with straight anti-freeze. 
As for damage you are probably OK. 
Good Luck
