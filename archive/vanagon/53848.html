Subject: 83 Westy-submersible water pump

My water pump in the holding tank blew a hole out the side of it. I don't
know when or how this happened, but I am looking for a similiar replacement.
It seems it would be easier to get a submersible one and installing it where
the other one was, but I can't find one. Does anyone have a source or the 800
number of Delta in Ca or their e-mail? I'd rathar not put one under the sink.
Has anyone done this and liked it as a solution? Someone mentioned J.C.
Whitney had such a one for about $20. How do I get a J. C. Whitney catalogue?
Thanks for your help. Bob in Orlando.
