what you're telling me that that plaid isn't the coolest stuff you've ever
seen. It is almost as hip and happenin' as the yellow vinyl they used on
older busses. If you would mine e-mailing me with the specifics of how you
fir the seats in, I would be most greatful.


&gt;&gt;A while back their was a thread regarding &quot;interchangability&quot; of vanagon
&gt;&gt;driver and passenger seats with other car seats, ie. Audi 4000?
&gt;&gt;Any more info? Anybody installed non-stock seats?

&gt;I installed some junkyard (but excellent condition) Vanagon seats in my
&gt;'76 Westfalia, and they are infinitely more comfortable, and work fine.
&gt;They are complete with the fold-down armrests, but did not come in orange
&gt;and green plaid, so don't fit the interior color scheme (was VW on drugs
&gt;in '76?).
&gt;
&gt;It took a bit of machine-work to get the runners to fit.  I used the old
&gt;runners and attached them to the new seats, so that the turn-around passenger
&gt;seat would work, too.  Some work, but DEFINITELY worth the effort!
