Subject: HELP! Electrical goofiness
Date: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 18:37:54 EST

Hey all,
	OK, I've got a problem which I need fixed ASAP.  Any help is
	GREATLY appreciated, but please respond to me and not the list
	because I can't seem to get subscribed.

	Anyway, here's the deal:  

	1978 bus, with the big taillights.  Right rear is acting up.
	When turn signals are applied with headlights on, the turn
	signal light lights up like it is supposed to but when it blinks
	on it causes the taillight to dim and when it blinks off the
	taillight brightens again. 

	Also, when the brakes are applied with right turn signal on, the
	same condition occurs.  The brake light does not light.  

	Also, (get this!) when the headlights are off and the brakes are
	applied (no turn signal), instead of the right brake light
	coming on, the turn signal light comes on steadily (!).  

	I'm guessing that the DPO has attempted to play junior mechanic
	and has rewired this thing without really knowing what he was
	doing.  I have a multimeter and test lamp, is there a way to
	test to see what should be hooked up to what?  How can I get the
	taillight assembly out of the hole in the body?  Please help as
	this goofiness really needs to be fixed.  

	On the bright side, I replaced the hazard flasher switch (got a
	used one from a '73 in a junkyard).  The used one cost $5.23 and
	works perfectly while the new one costs $38(!).  Anyway, that
	fixed some of the electrical goofiness (you used to have to
	wiggle the flasher switch to get the signals to work).  When I
	removed the hazard switch, I found that it was held together by
	duct tape and one of those elastic things that women use to hold
	their hair up.  DPO again I guess.  

	Please help!

	Thanks,
	Sean
