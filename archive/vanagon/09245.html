Subject:       South Africa connection

To Dereck and others:
Y'all (Joel's influence) probably know about the www page for South 
African servers--&gt;

http://www.is.co.za/www-za.html

but someone there may be able to help you ferret out this info you 
seek.  They do have a &quot;Digital Cafe&quot; one might pick up a conversation 
with.  Don't have time to fart around with it my self but I did 'pop 
in' for a look-see.  Lots of computer/university stuff (surprise).
