Subject: Re: a reason NOT to use the parking brake

i dont care what you all say,  i use my parking brake.   It was drummed into
me when i lived in the mountains,   parking spaces were often not level,  and
i still think its a good idea.  besides, i hate putting my foot on the clutch
and finding im rolling.

but if its going to sit for a while, i do leave the brake off.  I got a 64
panel van from a guy where it had been sitting in a field for about 13 years.
 we had to pull it with a tractor to break the brakes loose so it'd even
roll,  then remove the wheels to take the shoes off so we could tow it, as
the shoes were dragging.  if only the brake had been off...

&quot;There's a small probability that your spouse will forget to release it
before driving away.  In my case, it went 15 miles before being detected.&quot;
