Subject: Interesting Eurovan Pickup

Dropped by my local bike shop the other day on my Moulton, and there was 
a fellow out front loading HIS new Moulton into a Eurovan crewcab 
pickup.  Naturally we had to talk.

Turns out that he is in the landscaping business.  He often carries as 
much as two tons in the EV (rated for 1 ton) and finds it completely 
reliable.  In fact, he said that he has destroyed F*rd and Ch*v pickups 
in his business, but the EV keeps coming back for more.  

He would sell in a minute if he could get one with dual rear wheels.

Interesting vehicle - I told him that he could probably find a taker on 
the vanagon list!
