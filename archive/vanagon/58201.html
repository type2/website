Hey,

Well, the Vanagon is ready (I hope) and mostly packed so in about 3 or so
hours I'll wake up, finish the loading gas up and off I go.

Los Angeles to Nashville (10 to Las Cruces, NM; then to Alamgordo (BOOM) and
Roswell (see the &quot;crash&quot; site) then up to the 40 all the way to Nashville to
spend a few days with the folks and then down through AL to New Orleans where
I'll be working for the next 5 months or so.)

So if any of you out there see a clean white '87 Vanagon with a Yakima roof
rack, be sure to wave or blink or honk or just give me the finger and swerve
in my direction.  I'll either wave back or swerve off the road.

Take care and thank you, thank you, thank you for all your info.

Perry 
'87 Vanagon
