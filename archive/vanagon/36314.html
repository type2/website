&gt; So MrJimmy3_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Replaced Idle Stabilizer
&gt; &gt; Replaced Oxygen Sensor
&gt; &gt; Installed VW new wire harness to computer
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, now that you've played the &quot;Guess The Mystery Failing Part&quot; game
&gt; with your dealer reaping the benefits, it's time to take command of
&gt; the diagnoses yourself.

right.  and the dogs of war may be barking up the wrong tree.  that 
bogging/hesitation just off idle is NOT a fault of the idle 
stabilizer circuit.  the stabilizer just lets air bypass the throttle 
body to increase/decrease the idle speed.

time to set the basics.  i'm sounding like a broken record but it is 
vitally important to get everything back to spec.

1.  clean ECU grounds.
2.  switch to a non-ethanol fuel.
3.  remove throttle body.  clean it. set the basic throttle plate 
setting.  set throttle switches.
4.  set basic idle speed per Bentley.
5.  clean injectors, preferably with a pressurized cleaner system.
6.  replace plugs with W7DTC tri-electrode.
7.   check fuel pressures.
8.  set idle mixture.
9.  check ECU response to mixture changes via O2 sensor output.

Until every one of the above have been done, i would not replace 
components.  Too many garages subscribe to the &quot;plug and play&quot; method 
of component replacement trying to find a culprit.  as much as we 
all would like a smoking gun, often drivabilty complaints are a sum 
of individual substandard systems.  it takes persistence, knowledge, 
and very little cash to do the basics.  no wonder garges don't do it.

i think i hear a pulpit calling so i'll stop with the directive 
preaching.  i hope this helps and let me know if you need expansion 
on a procedure.
