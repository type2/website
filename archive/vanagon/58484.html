Subject: re: recalls, etc.

Just thought I'd let you all know:

After recieving the info about recalls, I decided to call VWA and inquire.
IT WAS GREAT! The rep. took my VIN and is running a full check to see
exactly what I'm covered on and what work has already been done. The whole
recall situation kind of freaked me out because I'm a newly-acquired vanagon
owner and am concerned about covering all of my bases.

Just thought I'd let you know that VWA was EXTREMELY helpful, in case any of
you are considering the same.
