Subject: Is nothing sacred?

I was checking out cars today and one lot had a mid-60's Corvair Greenbrier
van with a Westfalia pop-top and luggage rack stuck on the roof.  Jeez!  GM
left no stone unturned when they ripped off VW.  Or was this a secret
prototype quickly rolled out when Chevy officials first saw the Lumina APV
mini-van?

Enquiring minds want to know...
