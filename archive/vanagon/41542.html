Subject: Parts, Case Codes, head studs/nuts

	Having gotten Little Martha's clutch fixed, I finally concluded the
deal I struck when I bought her and picked-up the '71 front axle assembly
the DPO had accumulated to do a disk-brake retrofit. Bless her, my
wife says we can store it since we're moving and storing stuff anyway-
Out of idle interest, what's a front axle assembly worth? If I can
pick another up in a year for $100 or less, I might sell this one and
buy another when I have time to do the retrofit. (Certainly not this summer).

	Guy who sold me the pickup looked at my ECI engine and said
&quot;Hmmm, D case, that's a late 60s single port, I think this came with
an H case new, but it probably doesn't make much difference.&quot;
	Is this right and if so, what difference does a D case
make versus an H case in a pretty much bone-stock 1600sp with stock
carb &amp; distributor, extractor exhaust? I did have it built with GM
hydraulic lifters (and it clatters a bit, then quiets, if started
after a long sit, so I'm pretty sure they're in there..) I have
a Pertronix electronic ignition I'm going to install one of these
days.

	He also thought it was misfiring at idle (it doesn't seem
uneven to me- any opinions how to troubleshoot this?).

	Finally, said DPO, who is a mechanic, said that at the
300 mile mark on the new engine it would be a good idea to 
retorque the lower head nuts and reset the valves, because it
probably tightened up. Well, I shouldn't have to do the valves :)
but retorquing the head makes sense. 300 miles a good distance,
Volks? ECI is no longer in business (so much for my waranty) so
I can't ask them. They didn't mention this in their recomendations
and requirements that I recall.

	Having had the clutch clevis pin fail after 300 miles from lack of 
grease, and there being no pedal cover under the nose, makes me feel that 
this fellow is well intentioned but not *detail* oriented, if you know
what I mean. Maybe he's just an engine enthusiast...

	Cheers!
	Bill
