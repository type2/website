Is it just me or does Lance Garner (who is leaning agianst his &quot;1961 Panel
&lt;- obligatory VW reference) who is pictured on page 3 of the most recent
Old Bus Review having more than a passing resemblance to ole Unca Joel of
V_at_L fame?

I guess to be fair to Unca Joel I should offer to send him a photocopy of
the picture :) I don't think scanning it in would give a good enough
resolution.
