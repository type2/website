&gt; Maria and I are in the process of planning our next camping trip that
&gt; should take us from St. Louis to the Great Lakes, Quebec, New England and
&gt; down the East Coast to N.Carolina. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is our dilemma: we adopted a declawed cat, that as far as we know,
&gt; never ventured outside a home. We could ask friends to take care of him in
&gt; our absence, but we're also thinking about taking him along. Before we
&gt; spend any time getting him acquainted with nature, we're wondering if
&gt; anyone on this list has had any experience with taking a cat on a camping
&gt; trip and would like to share it with us. (No worries: either way, we'll do
&gt; whatever is in the best interest of the cat!)
&gt; 
&gt; TIA for your opinions!

Sami:

Although I wasn't born a cat lover, I have gotten used to them.  I think it 
depends a lot on the cat.  If declawed, then at least you don't have to worry 
about it ripping you to shreds if you hit the brakes suddenly.  One of our cats 
howls all the way to the vet when we put him in a carrier, and is scared 
shitless (literally) of travelling.  The other one rides quite happily, just 
like a dog, looking out the windows and having a great time.  I think that big 
fat lazy well adjusted adult cats are the most conducive to the camping 
experience.  My mother-in-law has a huge (20 lbs+) red tabby named Chester who 
is a great camper (76 Orange Breadloaf (the van, not the kitty)).  He also sails
with my father-in-law occasionally so he has gotten used to the whole idea of a 
mobile home base.  Outdoor cats seem to be quite good at finding their way home,
assuming you've got the time to wait.  If this cat has a good sense of 
direction, then you may be able to release it each time you stop and camp, 
assuming you can stick around for a few days.  You may get frustrated though if 
kitty wanders off, since you will be stuck waiting for it to come back.  Watch 
out for areas with coyotes.  Cats fall prey to them very often out here in CA.  
I think it would be damned near impossible to tolerate keeping it locked in the 
van.  However, you should probably bring along a litter box in the van since you
never know when nature may call.  If you have a friend who will kittysit, that's
probably your best option.  If you're bent on bringing it along, I'd take it out
on a few cruises around town in the van to see how it reacts.  (Vomit=bad, loss 
of bowel control=bad, nasty hissing=bad, doglike behavior=good).  You should be 
able to tell quickly whether kitty was born to ride.  Good luck.  (You must be 
nuts!)
