Hi Rick,
I'm just going to have to put together a &quot;pat&quot; response to this question 
so I don't have to re-enter the info everytime.  

Your friend has the dreaded VW ignition wiring syndrome.  Over time the 
wiring builds resistance and current flow to the starter solenoid is 
lowered to the point where it won't drive the solenoid anymore.  The fix 
is to buy a generic Ford solenoid ($5_at_Checker) and wire it to fire the 
solenoid on the starter.

If your friend is electron-challenged and doesn't know how these things 
work, have him wire the wire presently running from the ignition to the 
starter's solenoid to one of the smaller posts on the generic unit, then 
run a line from the other small post to ground.  Run a fat cable direct 
from the battery or off the solenoid's battery post to one of the big 
posts on the generic.  Run a line from the opposite large post direct to 
the starter solenoid.  I did this on my Rabbit and Vanagon and have had 
0 problems since.

Use good quality connectors, shrink wrap any exposed cable, get 
everything nice and tight and he shouldn't have any more problems.

Jack
