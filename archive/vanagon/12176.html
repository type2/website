Subject: Positive grounded '71 bus


	I have a 1971 camper, and it's positively grounded.  It was when I got
it 2 years ago, and has been since.  I've put in a new battery and a new
generator, and it works just fine.  The thing I'm wondering is,...

	Why the heck is it &quot;backasswards&quot;?

thanks!
