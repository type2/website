&gt;&gt; no air to the face.

&gt;	The A/C is pretty poor especially in hot weather and a complete waste
&gt;	with passengers in the back seat in hot weather. They sit under all that
&gt;	noise while the driver+ sweats.
&gt;	If I had kept mine, I had planned to port the right-most duct into the
&gt;	side vent nearby, seal off the fresh air intake in the grill and use
&gt;	the ventilation ducts to route cool air to the dash.

the only problem i can see with this idea is the distinct possibility of
condensation on the metal ... rusting the roof out from the inside. if you
could manage to plastic-coat it somehow, or run some plastic tubing ...

in the pictures in the german books i've seen, there are buses with the
a/c vent running along the sides of the roof ... so they can have front face
air AND the sunroof (or camper). :(    why do they get all the good stuff? :(
