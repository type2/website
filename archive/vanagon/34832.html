For $2,600 -$3,000 I expect a bus to be almost perfect, rustwise. Also, at
86K, the engine *may* be due for an overhaul before too long. I'm also
suspicious of any engine that has been converted back to carbs, because it
signals a mechanic's incompetence (what other &quot;improvements&quot; could such a
person have inflicted on the bus?). Poptop seal is easily (cheaply)
replaced. 

I suggest you spend 2 weeks and US$2,500 in California.
