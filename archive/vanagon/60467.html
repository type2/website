Subject: Re: Timing belt change frequency?

&gt; Where do you live Karl, that has an engine with a timing belt?

OK, so I look like an idiot now.  :-o  I just remembered my brother 
in law telling me about the headache of changing the timing belt on 
their Rabbit.  I admit I haven't spent much time in the one week that 
I've had the Vanagon looking at the details of the engine.  I thought 
pushrod threads were for air suckers.
