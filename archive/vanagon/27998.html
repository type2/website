Subject: Bars Leak - *3* flavors

i know all the air-heads juuust love to read this stuff.... :)

Bars Leak comes in at least 3 formulations:

1.  the standard 'rat turds in gravy' pellet formulation in a brown 
suspension.

2.  a 'new and improved' pre-dissolved formulation in a grey plastic 
bottle.  i haven't opened mine up yet but it sounds pretty soupy.

3.  dry tablets.  packed like a roll of thick Tums on a blister pack.

i don't have any 'field test' experience with this gunk... just 
thermite, uh- i mean AlumaSeal.
