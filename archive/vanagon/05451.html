Subject: 71 Steering - Is this bad?

Steering tight and within Bentley spec, EXCEPT not sure about the centered
position.  Book says that a little 'resistance' here is normal, but what does
that mean?

As I pass thru the centered wheel position on my bus, the steering wheel has
a one and one-half to two-inch rotational moment where no  movement is
transferred to the wheels.  I have verified that this is not play in the
steering linkage, either going into the box or coming out -- it's inside.

My question is, how do you determine if the box needs rebuilding?  Is this a
sign, or do all buses do this?

Thanks again, members
