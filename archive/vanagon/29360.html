&gt; &gt;I don't know all the details, but the husband wanted to know
&gt; &gt;a) is it possible it is NOT the heater motor itself and b) do you
&gt; &gt;REALLY have to remove the dashboard to get at the heater motor?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;He's got a large, green manual for her so he's done the research,
&gt; &gt;but wanted to consult with the pros.  :-)

&gt; &gt;Thanks for any info,
