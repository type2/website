Subject: 3 Questions

Volks...
   Howdy!?!  I would appreciate answers/experiences in response to these three 
questions....I have an '81 Westy(2000cc,FI)

1)  Can I get to the oil cooler without pulling the engine?  I once lost a dune 
buggy by running it with 1/2 inch of crud on the leading edge...I see some of 
that same kinda crud on the blades of my cooling fan.....

2)  Is it possible for me to get to the head bolts without pulling the engine?  
The guy I just bought it from wasn't too fond of tightening things to specs...

3)  This may be a stupid question:  So I changed the oil for the first time in 
the week or so since first purchase...cleaning the strainer and I found sizeable 
chonks/grindings of metal...is it time to start building another engine, or am I 
just paranoid?

Friends...any advice will help...I appreciate it/van_at_lenti/you....cheerio!
