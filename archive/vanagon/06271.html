&gt; If you want your diesel live a long life, it's not a zero maintenence
&gt; engine.  You need to check the valve clearances every 15K (at least).

Oops! forget that.... When I asked my FLaG about this, he seemed
non-plussed, but did it anyway... (he also mentioned that later 
diesel models had hydraulic lifters which did not need adjustment. I
can't vouch for their correctness)

In my informal net.survey, about 50% reponded

  &quot;OHMIGAWD, you GOTTA do it, or you will be sent to eternal hell,
   with hellfire burning you in unquenchable fury&quot;

The other half said:

  &quot;Gee, never done that..&quot;

Go figure...

  It seemed to me like a good idea. While you are at it, drain the water
from the bottom of the fuel filter too. They say that the fuel pump
hates water...

p.s. Is there anything else that I forgot? (Rather learn from Others
    mistakes than relearn them myself...) ( I know..RTFM...)
