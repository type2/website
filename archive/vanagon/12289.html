&gt;Back in Germany, I saw those really neat gizmos, that seem to be far
&gt;better than chains. They call them Spiders (I think) and their advantage
&gt;is that they are extremely easy to install, don't rust (cause made of
&gt;plastic), and are not as &quot;clunky.&quot; Also saw them in use in Switzerland: a
&gt;majority of cars had them.

&gt;If anyone has seen them anywhere
&gt;on the North-American continent, please let me know.


Sami,
I saw these at the dealer in San Francisco, Royal Motors(I think it was SF. I
was at 2 dealers that day, in SF and Redwood City, and it was at one of them)
on monday. I had no idea what they were. Around here we barely know what snow
is. Seeing your description, though, I'm sure this is what I saw. I'll call
and see what the price is for them if you want, or send you the phone number.
