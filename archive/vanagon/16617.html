Subject: Hesitation again


HEllo all:

Weel, unfortunately, the hesitation at highway speeds  has started up again. 
I checked the plugs (They have a grey ash colored covering on all of 
them((Bosch Platinum))) and the rotor and cap are new as of 2,000 miles ago. 
 How can I tell if my wiring harness is to blame?  Is there anyway to 
distingush the new from the old?  The person I bought the bus from cannot 
remember if he changed the harness or not(no records either). Any ideas as 
to why this started happening? Vanagon now has 100k.

Thanks!

Matt
