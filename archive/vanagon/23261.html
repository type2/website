&gt; problem (to refresh your memory): the van goes into gear (the stick
&gt; moves into the correct positions) as smooth as ever without the engine
&gt; running, but as soon as i start, it won't go into gear at all (except it'll m
&gt; toward, but not into, reverse with a huge GRIND).  if i put it in gear with
&gt; engine off, clutch in, it turns over but wont start.
&gt; 
&gt; listmember tim smith says that the pilot bearing is shot/seized, and i
&gt; believe him, it seems to make sense.  i have a question though: i talked to
&gt; a vw mechanic near here and he said that if the pilot bearing were shot,
&gt; it would be making noise that i could definitely hear.  is the mechanic
&gt; wrong  (i hope)?  i'd like to clear that up before i scrape together the $
&gt; and time to replace the pilot/release bearing, clutch plate, and pressure
&gt; plate.  thanks.

Speaking from experience, the pilot bearing as it wears out caused me
the following symptoms. First, when one of the needles jumped out of
the rusty bearing, the tranny input shaft spun with the crankshaft.
That's like having a broken clutch cable. You can't shift at all.
That did't last long. The needle ground itself to dust. Eventually
all of the needles fell out. Then shifting and driving was just fine.
The second symptom is a good sized tranny oil leak, but only at high
speeds.  That one is a real mystery unless you know what a pilot
bearing is.  I replaced the rear tranny seal twice before somebody
told me about the pilot bearing.


Moral: inspect and grease the pilot bearing every time you remove the
engine.
