Subject:      friday again

well, it's friday again, and i'm basically bored. :(  so you'll all have
to see through another version of Who and What We Are.  i had hoped and
semi-planned to go the Buses by the Arch (so i could get rid of all these
parts microfiche for 86 and 88 and syncro vanagons), but the Gods of
Wimsical Finance have not smiled upon me ... and besides, it'll probably
rain or be too hot or too many insects. yeah, that's the ticket: too many
bugs. :)  maybe i can make the long and arduous 10.5 hour drive around
Labor Day.

anyhoo ...

this is what everybody is (i've just been keeping track of every bus i
see on rec.autos.vw and the mailing lists):

in case you noticed, it fluctuates a bit because new people sign on, and
some folks sign off.
(Unknown means that they either don't have a bus now (and want to get
one), or they haven't told me what they have).
