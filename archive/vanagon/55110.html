Subject: Re: Vanagon Engine Alternatives


&gt;&gt;I had the opportunity to drive the Subaru conversion about 4 months ago.  I
&gt;visted Kennedy Eng. and they were nice enough to allow me to drive their
&gt;test bed.  I can say they have done a first class job in the conversion.  As
&gt;far as power, this van has lots of guts in will take mountain roads with
&gt;plenty of power!  If we were all honest about it, VW didn't do their
&gt;homework in making the waterboxer engine.  The Sabura engine is a product of
&gt;the late 80's and runs circles around the VW engine.  I love the concept of
&gt;the Vanagon and I say anything that will improve its reliability is worth a
&gt;look at.

How much was the conversion?
