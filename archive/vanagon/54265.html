Subject: FS: 1981 Vanagon

This 1981 Vanagon is very nice shape, runs good, no real rust, good
brakes, etc. It's air-conditioned, 4-speed. Located in Oshkosh, WI.
Asking $2200 or best offer. Moving to Alabama, must sell. 414-426-0796.
It's yellow and white, with beige/brown upholstery in good shape except
for drivers seat. Even the carpeting is fine.
