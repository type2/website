Subject: synthetic oil...


 i've have had good success with synthetic oil in my wasserboxer...
 it was properly broken in with dino oil and now runs amsoil 15-40...
 i would like to see if any one else is running synthetic in their
 water cooled vans? and what success you have had. also if you have
 had any unusual experiences with it.

 however, lately i have noticed a hyd. lifter that has started to
 tap faintly. not the tap associated with not running the engine for a while,
 but a much quieter tap that comes and goes regardless of engine temp.
 i figure this my be a draw back of synthetic oil, maybe it flows
 just a little too good and the lifters don't hold their pressure properly
 maybe it's become just too clean in there...

 so i'd like to hear about you experiences with this,
 maybe i should go to a different weight of oil...
