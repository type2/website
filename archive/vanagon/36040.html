&gt;    Is there any kind of oil spray or undercoating that's safe to use?
&gt;They don't recommend it in the manual for my '85, but the Canadian
&gt;Winter is taking its toll on my exhaust system! What's a good way to
&gt;protect it without having it melt or catch fire during those hot
&gt;summer drives to the cottage?

Not much you can do for the exhaust except to have it lated with Cadmium,
nickel, or some other good metal.  Just save your money for new and maybe
have the new parts plated.
