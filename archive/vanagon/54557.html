You might want to consider putting in a relay, even if the wiring will handle the load.

With a relay you will get the maximum output from the lights.  Also, your headlight switch 
will probably last longer because you'll eliminate the possibility of arcing.

&gt;Why won't it work? Remember the purpose of a fuse is to protect the wiring
&gt;and equipment in the circuit. If the 100w bulb draws 7.6 amps it is below
&gt;the rated current carrying capacity of the wire. Also I ran 140w bulbs in
&gt;my 72 bus and never blew a fuse or wire and didn't have unusually short
&gt;bulb life. My advice is go ahead and use them. IMHO

&gt;&gt;When it came time to replace one of mine I was wondering the same thing,
&gt;&gt;&quot;Will my wiring handle almost twice the current?&quot;. I doubt it.
&gt;&gt;Good Luck

&gt;&gt;, the 55W bulb draws 4.2 ampswhile the 100W bulb draws 7.6 amps. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, don't forget the original question :)  .  Can I safely put 
&gt;&gt;&gt;100W
&gt;&gt;&gt;H3 bulbs in a light made for 55W H3 bulbs?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks all,
