Subject: Re: Saw A Neat Bus

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;On the way to Bug-O-Rama last weekend, I saw a doublecab Sychro and a
&gt;&gt;Synchro panel.  The pickup had the &quot;tent&quot; on it, like the early ones
&gt;&gt;did.  These guys were on the way to the show.

I saw one unique old aircooled bus on HWY 101 oneday. From a distance I noticed
that the bus did not have engine comaprtment lid.  But I could not see the 
engine. There was something else there in place of the lid.

Guess what? It was a huge radiator.

Welcome back, Thom.
