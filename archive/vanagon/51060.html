&gt;&gt; I just bought and '87 Synchro, and an outboard front CV boot let go the 
&gt;&gt; first day (did I turn a corner too tight?). I plan on pulling all the 
&gt;&gt; axles and repacking the joints.  What's the best CV boot available, and 
&gt;&gt; where can I get them?  Is there a split boot available (for a temporary 
&gt;&gt; measure)?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Also, where's a good place to get VW and Vanagon parts in the Boston 
&gt;&gt; area?

Mr. Meschwitz,
It's always nice to meet another Syncronaut.  Please contact me directly - I
don't know your email address and would like to hear about your &quot;new&quot; Syncro.

Regards,
Jim Davis
