     That should go to a charcoal canister, part of the fuel tank vapor 
     emissions controls. Have one on my Thing.  The canister is mounted up 
     by the tranny. A small line goes from the fuel tank to the canister 
     and brings gas vapors. A large line goes from that doghouse connector 
     to the canister and brings in pressurized air which goes through the 
     charcoal and back out another large line that goes into the air 
     cleaner to 'recycle' the vapors.

&gt;One more question about my '66 fan shroud.  I'm mounting a dog-house 
&gt;cooling system on the engine I'm building and the dog-house shroud has 
&gt;a small (mebbe 1/2 inch) pipe sticking out the *top* of the shroud off 
&gt;to one side a bit.  This is in addition to the two fresh-air-heating air
&gt;ducts on the *back* (back means back of the car) of the shroud that connect 
&gt;to the heat exchangers and the duct on the *front* of the shroud for the oil 
&gt;cooler exhaust.  What is this pipe used for?  (I guess this is a good 
&gt;question for 1971 bus owners or for 1971 and later sedan owners since that 
&gt;was where the dog-house cooling tin was used.)
&gt;
Hey, I was wondering that myself.  When I bought my '71, nothing was hooked 
up to it either.  I just plugged it so that air that might be used for 
cooling wasn't being released from it, but I'm kind of curious.
