Subject: Re: Gauge placement 86 westy

A while back I wanted to install a 2&quot; round vacuum guage on my Rover 3500,
and I didn't want to booger up the dash either. Instead I discovered that a
frozen orange juice can is the perfect diameter to mount the guage in.

I trimmed down the can until it was just deep enough to hold the guage. I
spray painted it flat black, drilled a hole for the hose to pass through
and attached it to the top of my steering column, and inserted the guage.
Really an inconspicious install.

My new find is getting the same treatment, very soon. I believe the
steering column is still the sweet spot for me. I'm sure that two guages
could be added, and if your persistant Maybe three on top, and one one each
side. Said differently there is probably five different mounting locations
on the steering column that would give you a good sight line, and not
reflect in the windshield with the night light burning.

Consider a vacuum guage too.  It can give mountains of information about
the powerplant's current state of affairs.

&gt;&gt;  the radio.I plan to retain the warning lights so way over there may work
&gt;&gt;  out.Any input on a good location would me appreciated.I recently bought
&gt;&gt;  this 86 westy and no oil presure gauge is difficult for me,I just like to
&gt;&gt;  know what is going on.

&gt;Darrell,
&gt;
&gt;I installed a 2 inch deep (about 2.5 in round) analog oil pressure guage in
&gt;the dash of my 85 Westy.  I cut the hole between the ashtray and the
&gt;instrument cluster.  Worked just fine.
