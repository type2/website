Subject: Creaking clutch

For some time now the clutch pedal in my '79 Bus
creaks, groans, and feels (especially if you're
taking off in first) like there are little notches
catching it.  The clutch itself seems to be in
good adjustment, but I did it again anyway.  Also
soaked the pedal assembly with WD-40 (helped for a
while) penetrating oil (ditto) then cleaned it &amp; lubed
it all up again.  Now it's creaking and &quot;notching&quot;
again.  Advice from ace mechanics, cheerful crackpots
and all others earnestly sought.  BTW, the clutch is
fairly new (30K) and I take good care of it...

Thanks.
