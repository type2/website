&gt;anyone have suggestions on the 'best' procedure for flushing?

&gt;Thanks in advance for your input.

DON'T DO IT!  The heat in the engine compartment is high enough to make the 
plastic T's breakup and self destruct when least wanted. This was the advice 
from many many posters in rec.autos.xxx (I can't remember which group). I 
don't know about flush additives, makes sense, but I've never done it. Drop 
your spare tire and pull of the lower rad hose(drain coolant safely). Use a 
garden hose and flush into the rad, and from the fill tank in the rear. Did 
this once on my old van, lots of brown water came out each time I stuck the 
hose into it. '87 needs it now, let me know if you get a good safe rec. for 
a pre-flush additive. tim s.
