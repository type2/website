Has anyone else tried to find rebuilt mainshafts for their busses, lately?
My local supplier, Imparts, who was going to charge me about $80 for a
rebuilt unit, told me that they are not currently available. So I called
the Parts Place, guessing that if they didn't have rebuilts either, they
might at least have a used one. Being rather desperate, I agreed to the
$100 price tag, figuring it might be a demand and supply thing. But I got
*really* p.o.'d when the shipping arrived and I realized that they had
also charged me for one core: $20! Since when does one owe a core charge
for junkyard items? Moreover, if those shafts are not presently being
remanufactured, why would anyone even *need* a core??

Fumingly Yours,

Sami
