Subject: Re: Cable lubricators /type motorcycle

&gt;Yamaha, years ago made a wonderfull cable lubricator.  It consisted 
&gt;of a cast aluminum body with a thumbscrew that would compress a 
&gt;rubber sealing deely-bob onto the end of a cable.  One then uses 
&gt;their favorite aerosol lube with a snorkle hose and sticks the 
&gt;snorkle into a tiny port in the lubricator.  Every thing on these 
&gt;jobs was very well made and the bugger really works (they even had a 
&gt;small rubber seal where the snorkle goes in).  It is one of my 
&gt;favorite tools  box  additions and is frequently used.  It is 
&gt;particularly effective in loosening heater control cables.

I know that these are still sold.
I company &quot;Dennis Kirk&quot; sells one for $12.50 part ## 31-151 or a kit with a 
can of lube they say is good to -70 deg. for $14.50 part ## 31-32.
Phone # 1800-328-9280
hope that helps.
