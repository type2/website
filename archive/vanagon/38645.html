&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I have done the manditory lurking and read (most) of the info in the
&gt; archives and am finally ready to take the step to intorduce myself.
&gt; My name is Doug Skinner and I live in Bowling Green, Kentucky. I am
&gt; the proud (2nd) owner of a 1985 Vanagon GL. I have owned my bus since
&gt; 1988 and dearly love it (it is the first VW I have owned).
&gt;
&gt; Now a question...  My Vanagon is a &quot;GL&quot; and I know this must signify
&gt; something as my insurance company charges me higher rates for the
&gt; privlidge of having those two letters on the back of my bus, but I
&gt; don't have any idea what they signify.  Could someone enlighten me?


Funny you should ask:

My 1980 Westy was an &quot;L&quot;, and my 93 EV is a &quot;GL&quot;.  Bottom line is:  &quot;Sh*t
if I know!&quot;  Based on my experiences with the EV, I've just assumed that GL
stands for &quot;Good Lord!&quot; or &quot;Grand Larceny!&quot; or something like that.
