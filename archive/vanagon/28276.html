&gt;&gt;their female readers and see if they would like Brad Pitt type
&gt;&gt;people posing with the cars.  To be &quot;fair,&quot; they could then feature
&gt;&gt;12% of their photos in such a light.

Brad Pitt is an action/adventure character created by one of America's worst
writers.  He is of course enormously popular.  

The Hooverized version of the character is Dorque Pratt, whose hilarious,
well written satirical adventures remain unpublished.
