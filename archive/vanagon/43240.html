Subject: 	Re: Metric Ton (was Stoopid Parts Stores)

As a follow up to Bob Hoover's FLAPS counter person spweing &quot;Oh, you mean
AMERICAN metric fittings.&quot;

I was out running around yesterday on a much deserved &quot;sick-day&quot; &lt;insert
fake coughing&gt; when I noticed the Toyota T-100 pickup truck which I was
following had a tailgate badge that read &quot;Metric Ton.&quot; I haven't done the
simple homework to find the answer but had to laugh to myself that it was
like a Swahili inch or something. Isn't an inch an inch and a ton a ton?
Where is the standard here?

I vote for the metric system and a four day work week. I can hear all of the
possible &quot;inch&quot; jokes that we all have heard creeping out of the dusty
corners of my mind. I will spare you all if you promise to return the favor.
