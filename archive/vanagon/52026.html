&gt; &gt;What is the diagnosis??  Head gasket?

Hopefuly it's not head gasket. But if it is then just the gasket set could
cost you $200. My 84 vanagon at 110k went that route once. My pocket was shy
of cash so I decided to cure it myself. I bought a set of gasket (don't remember
exactly the cost). I had the job done myself successfully.

Before I did it I called upon some VW dealers. I found that they did not want to 
sell me piston liner set. They said it is impossible for home mechanics to do
it at home and therefore it was not to be sold at dealerships. Also, they wanted
$100+ for each exhaust valve and a little less for intake ones. I thought that
was an intention of rip off. I bought the gasket from a gray market parts place.
Well, I was warned that I should not take the cylinders off or I would need 
special tools to do the job. Too late, I had taken them off. I realized that
it indeed was difficult to put them back in.

Well, I made the tool from just about $10 of hardware. I was able to remove
all pistons and cleaned up all ring grooves before putting them back. At the
end I successfully reassembled the engine with all new gaskets and sealant.
The van has been on the road for over 1k miles now. Everything is still
fine. My driveway is free of coolant drops now.

The cylinders and pistons are in surprisingly good condition after 110k miles.
I did not see any visible wear on the cylinder wall. But the vale tips were
kind of smashed a bit. I did not replace them so the engine is a bit noisy
now. I will get new heads next time in maybe a couple of years. The engine
probably can last over 200k miles.
