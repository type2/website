|I think one of the better high volume acquarium pumps with 5/8 inch

How about the fuel pump from a fuel injected car (Rabbit for example) Should 
pump oil OK if it can pump gasoline. Only question is can it take the 
temperatures invoved?
Next question. Where is best spot to make connections to sump? Are there 
plugs somewhere we can take out?
