Subject: tires and bumper '81 westie

Hi again,

I misfiled the message (that means I lost it) about the perfect model
Yokohama tires.  Was it tire model 356 in 195R14?  Is about $100 each
mounted and balanced about right for these?

Also, you may remember me looking for a rear bumper with a built in hitch,
kind of like a step bumper on a US pickup.  Nobody seemed to make one, so I
got a local welding shop to make me one.  They came up with a great design
and did a really nice job.  It looks good, fits great, has a 2&quot; receiver,
is strong, and only cost me $150, which was much less than a new bumper and
hitch.

I have it off to paint it right now, but will have it back on in a couple
of days, and will put a picture on my web site then, if anyone is interested.

	Thanks,

Bill
