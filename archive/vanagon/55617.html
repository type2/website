Subject: Vanagon annihilation revisited

Home sick from teaching today;  I was watching the Oprah Winfrey show
when they showed the wayward tank rolling over that poor Vanagon.  It
made me think that the Vanagon would probably have been okay if not for
that bohemoth motorhome parked behind it.  The VW was pushed into the
motorhome long before it gave up the good fight.  This is great
statement for the owning of a Westy instead of a motorhome. 
	I now park my Syncro away from anything bigger than it.
