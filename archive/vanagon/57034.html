Subject: Radiator, serviceable?

In the good(?)old days, radiators on Detroit iron used to be serviceable
at radiator shops:  one could have them &quot;rodded-out&quot; to restore cooling
system efficiency that had gradually been lost due to build up of
deposits in the tubes.  Can anyone tell me if the cross-flow radiator in
the vanagon (84 in particular) is similarly serviceable?  Or is it
another of those modern conveniences that is &quot;serviced&quot; by buying a new
one?  Has anyone had experience taking their Vanagon radiator to a
radiator shop?
