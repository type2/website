Subject: Re: Locking engine compartment latch?

	Bob,
	I'm not sure I comprende double-cubby-door... 
	Its a 70, bay-window, with a 9' 4&quot; flat bed. The bed comes in two
sections, with a firewall between them. The back part of the bed is universal
to all pickups, single and double cab. The front part of the bed is only
found on single-cabs, since dual-cabs have the back seats there.
	This area thats the foot-well on a double cab has two hatches,
one on each side, giving access to it. I haven't been able to open
these hatches- they were locking, and have been broken, but not
opened as far as I can see.

	Is that what you mean by double cubby door?

	Don't the split-window type pickups (single cab) have
the same under-bed cargo space?

	Bill
