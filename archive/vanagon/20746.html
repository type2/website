Subject: early impression of my EV

Well, I've had my EuroVan for about a month and thought I'd add
some early impressions.  Just got back from a 2.5K mile camping trip 
(very short for you GNATT folks!) to Atlantic Canada.  Only 
problem was a persistent slow leak in one of the tires.  I'm
very pleased overall and the trip was much more enjoyable due to the 
gobs of space.  I found the power adequate and it's great at cruising
speed.  I find other's criticism of EV noise and power unwarranted.
The mileage was fairly consistent at about 21 mpg, and that's with the
auto trans.

My next home improvement job has to be to install a hydraulic lift in the
garage.  What a bear to change the oil.  It's hard to explain, but if other 
EV owners have already done it, they know what I mean.  Never thought I'd 
need a 30mm socket and 1/2 drive for a filter change! I'd hoped it would
be about as easy as my 5 cyl. Quantum (one of the easiest in my experience). 
2 = hours later I was done.  Next time will be a lot shorter, but still a
pain.  

(Joel, I carried the parts fiche with me just in case!)
