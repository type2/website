Subject: Re: Restoration business in Memphis, lets buy it!

 
Hey, I've got my checkbook open and ready to write for $239 or 
$1.59/mo.  

Memphis is only a short day's drive away for me!  Just think, we can 
also each have our own dealer's license plates too!  No more worrying 
about passing emissions.   Imagine the clerk's face when an order for 627 
dealer plates comes in. hehehehe.

I also motion Joel to head this venture.  

Now, I'm thinking of 50 acres of land in AZ or TX.  We should have 
someplace dry and warm to store our spare parts cars!
