Subject: Mass Transit &amp; politics

	Regarding GM &amp; Firestone &amp; &lt;some gas company&gt; buying and
trashing the LA street-car system. It went to trial and the three
companies who had covertly bought the functioning trolly cars and
replaced them with GM busses running on Firestone tires and burning
&lt;whois&gt; gas WERE found guilty of conspiracy to do something illegal
and fined. $5000. Wow, that must have really hurt 'em.

	Flame suit ON:

	I sure feel free in my ()*%))($% car in the middle of 4 lanes of 
)(*$)*$)% cars, going &lt;10mph for mile after mile, on a freeway paid for
by *GENERAL* sales taxes, burning oil from Kuwait, knowing that
evil socialism is safely at bay. 

	My personal theory: US auto/road culture is like US homebuilding,
all that money changes hands and everyone gets the same low quality product.
If you can't buy a superior product for any price, it suggests that
someone has an interest in selling junk and is protecting their turf.
The system's crooked, the game's rigged. Fortunately, I've got other
problems to distract me :)

	Cheers!
	Bill
