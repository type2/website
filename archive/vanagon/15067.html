Subject:       Re: Early Bus Gas Tanks

&gt;     What is the capacity of the '67 tank?  I was told the capacity on
&gt; the '56 tank was 11.1 gallons; a friend told me he thinks the capacity on the
&gt; '67 was 15 Gallons or so.  Anyone have a reliable source of info for this?
&gt; (ie owners manual)

He must have a four gallon gas can hidden somewhere in his bus.  My 
'67 stops at $10.00-$11.00 when I fill it up.
