I got a great one-piece front carpet from Kyle Wade-Volksmotor Sports last
year that fit and matched in color perfectly.  Check with Kyle, but the
price then was around $70.

Talk about Sticker Shock!  When the parts guy at my dealer said I would
laugh when I saw the price of the front carpet section for my 90 Carat
from the factory, I knew it would be expensive, but I was prepared.
BUT, when he stumbled out the $515 price, and to boot &quot;if I can get it&quot;,
I did in fact LAUGH!  Now, I am wondering about alternatives.  Anybody
know of any good ones?

Thanks in advance,

Ed
