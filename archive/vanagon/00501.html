Hello everyone!

My name is Wolfram von Kiparski.  Nice to see a bus owners' mail server.
I own a 1970 camper that is just starting to rust out behind the front wheel
wells.  Rocker panels aren't too hot either.  Rear shock absorber fell off
last week.  My baby needs bread, the grease for a lot of TLC.  Runs well though.
Stay out of strong winds,

Wolf
