Subject: Re: Insurance

Greetings, all.  Indeed I pay so much more I get sick writing the numbers
down.  Because I have two young men----I pay $5000 per year for three
vehicles with me (old lady psychiatrist) and two lads 19 and 21 both of whom
love to speed and don't mind getting tickets (actually each only 1 ticket
every 18 months or so, not too bad considering their ages).  78 VW Westy, 84
Volvo DL and 92 Subaru SVX.  $800 each car.

So--------count yerselves lucky!!  Enjoy all your money!!
