Subject: Re: MECHANICS IN SO. JERSEY



&gt;With all the talk about good shops in northern and central New 
&gt;Jersey, I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for 
&gt;South Jersey ?  I'm very close to philly (Just across the Walt 
&gt;Whitman or Commadore Barry) so shops in philly would be ok.  I 
&gt;haven't been able to find a mechanic or shop that I
&gt;feel comfortable with working on my Vanagon. 

This may not be close enough (near the Ft. Washington exit of the 
Pa. turnpike, not far from N.E. Philly), but I have had good 
experience with CSE in Oreland, Pa (215-885-5570).  Bill, the 
owner, is the type of Volkswagen mechanic who can identify a 
problem by listening to the noise faster and more accurately than 
anyone with a million dollars worth of test equipment.  Hs is not 
cheap, but he is good.
There is also a place in Burlington, NJ called Volks-Tech.  Have 
heard good things about them (albeit regarding air-cooled motors), 
but have not had personal experience.
