Subject: Re: How original is this type II ?

&gt;The bus was a `cargo'-bus, with no rear seats, a sliding door, and at
&gt;first glance no rust at all. I understand the sliding door option is
&gt;quite rare, but I'm not sure.
&gt;The sliding door had 2 windows in them, just as the opposite panel (are
&gt;they a factory option ?) These windows looked good, but they seemed
&gt;different than the side windows I see in the magazines (on micro/deluxe
&gt;buses).

With the sliding door with two windows it sounds like it could be a (ex)fire 
tender. I know a sliding door was an option on late split window panel vans 
but does anyone know about the two side windows? If they are factory windows 
they are recessed into the panel and if they are flush with the metal they 
were probably added later.
