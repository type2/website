Subject:       NON V.W.  european moped repair (Puch)

Sorry about not being v.w. related here.
    I have a '78 Puch moped made in italy by styer - damler(sp?)  it 
is a really cool machine but has serious piston slap.  i need info on 
where to find manuels and parts.  It seems the company went out of 
business long ago and when i say Puch to any of these new repair 
places the common responses seem to be Duh what? or out right 
laughter.  Maybe there is even a moped list out there some where.  If 
anyone can give me even a hint of information it would be greatly 
apreciated.

Hey i remember reading that Porsche was an exec. at styer-damler way 
back when.  I wonder if it's the same company.  maybe this has some 
streched v.w. relavancy after all. 

thanks.
Ed.
