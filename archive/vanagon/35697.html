Subject: Santa Cruz weekend trip report


This event was suggested by Scott, new to our list (you may remember 
him from his by now rather famous 168K scan of the map of this 
campground, which apparently not only shut down several mail systems 
across the globe, but which also auto-unsubbed some from the list 
entirely, and may have been responsible for a complete netsplit on 
the west coast for several hours.  This man knows how to use 
power  :).  At any rate, Scott and Joby were going to be camping 
at Sunset Beach in Santa Cruz anyway this past weekend, and thought 
they'd casually mention it to see if anyone from the list would 
join them.  Little did they know how committed (and we should be) 
we all are about attending such events, even last minute.  The fact 
that this weekend happened at all is rather amazing.  In what other 
group can you announce a trip last minute and have so many show up?  
In attendance were:

Scott and Joby Diffik
Ron Lussier and Dan Greening
Jeff Schneiter, with Travis and Argo
Bradley Prunehead
Dave, Francesca, Nikki, Siena, Max, and Zoe Kautz
Swiss Al Hubbard
me

Because of the last minute nature of this trip, it was half the 
usual length, with the bulk of people arriving around Saturday 
noon, and leaving about 24 hours later.  We were able to get 
relatively adjacent, close by campsites to one another, and descended 
upon the poor Kautz family's picnic table and fire-ring.  Bradley 
fortunately brought enough wood for a whole weekend (can you 
imagine otherwise?), plus the proverbial magnesium burnings to 
show, and we entertained ourselves using gasoline as charcoal 
starter, etc.  

The other worst thing for the Kautzes was the fact that I'd brought 
along my goped (a sort of skateboard with handlebars, but with an 
attached weed-whacker motor).  Between the Kautz kids, Jeff's friend 
Travis, and many of us adults lucky enough to still be in touch 
with our &quot;inner child,&quot; we managed to go thru nearly 3 tanks of 
gas with the thing, and the decibel level made poor Dave Kautz 
close to actually needing to be committed.  Dave - sorry about 
that, we just can't help ourselves most of the time  :)

It used to be that I tried to really &quot;organize&quot; the food on these 
trips.  Trip #1 started out with making sure all the food groups 
and dishes were covered, and with a lot of obsessive planning.  By 
about trip #4, it became clear that we all ate just as happily and 
well if I said something like &quot;bring stuff to share.&quot;  With this 
group, it all just somehow seems to work out.  We dined on 
exquisite culinary delicacies everyone seemed to just coincidentally 
have on hand or make up, like:

curry
BBQ shrimp
kielbasa
tofu hotdogs
turkey burgers
pickles
chili
couscous


Stuff we burned:
all kinds of toxic garbage
copper pennies
kevlar gourmet plastic utensils
Bradley's arm, unfortunately
about a winter's worth of wood resembling a telephone pole

I never made it to the beach, but Ron and Dan gave me some beautiful 
shell souvenirs thereof - thanks!

Many of us checked out the mechanicals and home decor of others' 
vans, then left the park around noonish.  The 4 cars of the last 4 
people on the list of attendees above decided to caravan and sightsee 
on the way back up to the Bay Area, meandering up highway 1, then 
on over highway 84, thru former Ken Keysey-land, Alice's restaurant 
west, etc., then finally all crashing out for a bit for a great 
time at Kautzes, where Dave and Francesca whipped up some wonderful 
fresh garlic sauce and pasta, with red wine, espresso, truffles, 
etc.  I finally departed the south bay around dinnertime.

As usual, there was a lot of the proverbial dada- and surrealism, 
and just general lunacy on this trip.  Thanks to Dan Greening for his suggestion that we grill something REALLYJweird,like a Barbie-doll 
(hence my earlier post on he matter).  This really intrigued me:  we 
could have Barbie on the &quot;barbie,&quot; or if we can manage to find 2 of 
them - Barbie on the Barbie on the barbie.  Australian, ya know.  :)  

The &quot;rest of you&quot; should come join us next time and experience it 
firsthand.  That would be this coming weekend at Peppermint, north 
of Lake Isabella, if the weather permits the roads to be open.
