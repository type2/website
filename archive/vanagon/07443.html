OH duhhhhhhhh!  Don't forget that any Aussie on the split list is also RHD!

I doubt anyone could match a Devon camper conversion though (gnash!)

Another AUS strangeness is that whilst anything Karmann is extremely rare there
are LOTS of splits and early bugs around (and not worth much at all - i.e.,
they are not yet considered collectible).  It is not that unusual to see these
vehicles in basically sound condition (and rust free) being sold for $300 -
$1000 Australian.
