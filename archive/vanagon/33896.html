&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;He also suggested that my missing preheater hose, which is supposed
&gt;&gt;to come through the hole in the sheet metal next to the pulley, normally
&gt;&gt;blocks hot air from entering the engine compartment. Since mine's been
&gt;&gt;gone since before I owned the bus, this could contribute to the overheating
&gt;&gt;this car's been experiencing. Hmmm...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A word to the wise. Which someday I hope to be one of.

&gt;&gt;What did you finally do about that hole for the preheater hose.  Do you 
&gt; have the old original air cleaner?  I don't and therefore don't know
&gt; what to do about that hole.
