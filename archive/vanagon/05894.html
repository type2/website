Subject: Re: More carb troubles



&gt;Just something amazingly simple I did. My '67 would start great, drive
&gt;fine, then cut off as soon as Ilet off the gas to stop or turn. It was
&gt;horrible; I cranked the idle way up, checked my timing and everything.
&gt;Iwas telling a friend, and he said, &quot;oh, it's probably the electronic
&gt;fuel cut-off switch&quot; (I think that's the name.)So we checked, and the
&gt;wire was slightly loose. BTW, that's the round thing sticking off the
&gt;side of the carb with a wire on it. We tightened the wire connection,
&gt;and everything was perfect. So make sure all your wires are really on
&gt;there tight. Sometimes it's the simple little things that cause the
&gt;biggest problems.

If you guys just solved my problem, I'm gonna be one happy camper =) hee hee

I spent yesterday tuning up Poncho, my bus, and all was running great, 
just purring along, and then, whammo, she dies, and won't start again.  
It sounds like the cuttoff switch to me.

*Geez, now I'm gonna have to change back all the things I f*ck'd with 
trying to get it to start.


I knew I liked this mailing list for a reason =)
