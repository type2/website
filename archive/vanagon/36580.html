Subject: 87 Air box - wiper contact

Thanks to all of you helping me thru my Syncro fix on the new wiper contact.

My question is - the wiper has two contacts on that funky circuit board deal.

Are the two contacts for the same signal i.e. - are there two in case one
goes bad.

The reason for the quesiton - when i carefully bent the arm on the wiper to
develope new contact - I did it ever so slightly.  I would like to bend it
even more to have a nice clean contact surface.

Also, those of you who have done this fix - how long did it work for?? Seems
like it should work for another 100,000.  Or maybe until the transmission
goes bad and I light the whole thing on fire.
