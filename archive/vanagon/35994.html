Subject: Where Matty J. should register...

	I couldn't resist calling California DMV to find out what they 
say. I spent about a minute in the automated system and then talked to 
a nice lady who said:

	If the car is currently registered, Matty can just drive it home.
(Keep the bill of sale with you!)

	If the car is NOT currently registered, California DMV can sell
him a one-trip temporary registration to get him home.

	All this applies to used vehicle only.


	It would probably be good to know what Matty's home state DMV
will expect too, but I think that answers the question of how to
operate the new-to-them camper here and on the way home.

	I hope Matty and his girlfriend make it down to the Bay Area!

	Bill
