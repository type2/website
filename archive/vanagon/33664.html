Subject: RE: aftermarket seats

Bill Kennedy asks how I like my Volvo seats. They are not ideal as they do
indeed sit somewhat higher than the stock seats, which can be a problem
for anyone shorter than I (177cm, 5'9&quot;?), as their feet would dangle like
those of a five-year old without touching the floor. The thicker backrest
also forces the seat further to the front, which might force a *very* tall
person's knee caps against the dash. To install the seats as low as
possible, I had to remove the sliding front/back adjusting mechanism,
hence the seats can no longer be moved. Finally, the height of the
backrests also prevents us from installing the child's cot while camping. 

The good news is that they fit nicely for average sized people and that 
our backs no longer ache after long trips. They're also heated which is 
nice in the winter. Although our boogers still freeze, our bums stay nice 
and toasty.

A better choice might be a pair of Porsche seats, which take up less 
space (David S.?). The low profile seats out of a Honda Civic or CRX 
might also work. For a nice job, however, I would get Recaro (or similar) 
seats, which are sometimes advertized in VW magazines; those also come 
with custom adaptors.
