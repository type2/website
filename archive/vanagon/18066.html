&gt;Has anyone installed a trailer hitch on their van?  We tried calling
&gt;around locally and were told that only extreme light duty( class 1 I
&gt;think) are available because of the VW specs that the van can't be used
&gt;for towing.  Has anyone gotten around this?  We are interested in towing
&gt;a tent trailer now, but were thinking for the future, ie u-haul trailer,
&gt;etc.  What types of hitches are being used and where are they obtained?
&gt;Also is there any modifications required or welding to the frame?  Thanks!

here's some info about places that might be worth checking ... the trailer
makers might have some info about hitches (which they would have to know if
they want to sell their trailers, right? :)
