Bob,

Check the Vanagon list archives for Helmut's 3-24-97 post about &quot;Re: 82
Vanagon gearbox swap ?&quot;.

He lists numerous gearbox ratios, including diesels and turbodiesels. 
Generally, the gas 4-speeds use a 4.57, 4.83, or 4.86 final drive, while
the non-turbo diesels use a 5.43, 5.83, or 5.86.  The factory turbodiesels
have a 0.78 fourth gear (instead of 0.85) and a 5.50 final drive.

&gt; 
&gt; Been away from the list for a while, good to be back. I'm about to re
&gt; power my `82 Westy Diesel with a 1.9L Turbo Diesel. It pretty much looks
&gt; like a drop in with a few minor changes. Of course, I'll still have the
&gt; old 4speed, which brings me to my real question...Is the gas 4 speed the
&gt; same gear ratio as the diesel 4 speed? As it stands, I'll probably have a
&gt; top speed of about 60-65mph, which is Ok but it'd be nice to see
&gt; 75-80mph.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
