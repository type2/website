&gt;                 CAR BATTERY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
&gt;                             JUNE 24, 1995
&gt;
&gt;                            
&gt;A word of caution.  Batteries contain a sulfuric acid electrolyte which is
&gt;a highly corrosive poison and produces gasses that will explode if
&gt;ignited.  When working with batteries, you need to remove jewelry, wear
&gt;protective clothing and eye ware, and exercise caution.  Follow the
&gt;manufacturer's instructions for testing, jumping, installing and charging.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1.  WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Check specific gravity in each cell and remove surface charge
&gt;before load testing,
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Retest after deep discharges or jump starts,
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Recharge slowly at 14.6 volts,
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Buy the freshest and largest Reserve Capacity, non-sealed (low
&gt;maintenance) car battery that will fit with a CCA rating for your climate
&gt;that meets or exceeds the car's OEM cranking amps requirements, and
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Perform preventative maintenance, especially during warm
&gt;weather.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2.  WHY BOTHER?
&gt;
&gt;Because only the rich can afford cheap batteries.....
&gt;
&gt;A good quality car battery will cost between $50 and $100 and, if properly
&gt;maintained, will give you four to eight years of service.  The purpose of
&gt;a battery is to start the car; to provide power for the ignition, lighting
&gt;and other accessories when their combined load exceeds the capability of
&gt;the alternator; and to filter the power.  Dead batteries almost always
&gt;occur at the most inopportune times, e.g., returning home from a long
&gt;trip, during bad weather, late at night in a dark parking lot or when you
&gt;are late for an appointment.  You can easily spend the cost of a new
&gt;battery or more for an emergency jump start or tow.  
&gt;
&gt;Most store employees do not know how to correctly test a battery.  The
&gt;national average of &quot;defective&quot; batteries returned to the manufacturer
&gt;that are in fact good is 50%.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;3.  HOW DO I TEST A BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Visually inspect for obvious problems, e.g., damaged case,
&gt;corrosion, loose hold-down clamps or cable terminals, or low electrolyte.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  If you have just recharged you battery or driven your car,
&gt;eliminate any surface charge by one of the following methods; otherwise,
&gt;go to the next step:
&gt;
&gt;          1.  Allow the battery to sit for two to three hours,
&gt;
&gt;          2.  Turn the headlights on high beam for three minutes and 
&gt;                wait five minutes before further testing, or
&gt;
&gt;          3.  With a battery load tester, apply a 150 amp load
&gt;                for 10-15 seconds.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Using the following table, determine the battery's
&gt;state-of-charge.  The BEST way to measure the state-of-charge is to check
&gt;the specific gravity in each cell with a hydrometer.  A temperature
&gt;compensating hydrometer can be purchased at a auto parts store for
&gt;approximately five dollars.  If the battery is sealed (maintenance free),
&gt;the correct procedure to test it is to measure the battery's voltage
&gt;WITHOUT the engine running with a good quality digital DC voltmeter.  Some
&gt;sealed batteries have built-in hydrometers.  They are not good testing
&gt;devices because they only measure the state-of-charge in one of the six
&gt;cells.
&gt;
&gt;If the state-of-charge is BELOW 75% using either test, then the battery
&gt;needs to be recharged BEFORE proceeding.  If there is a .050 or more
&gt;difference in the specific gravity reading between the highest and lowest
&gt;cell or the battery will not recharge to 75% or higher, then the battery
&gt;should be replaced.
&gt;
&gt;          Battery            Approximate           Average Cell
&gt;          Voltage          State-of-charge       Specific Gravity
&gt;
&gt;           12.66                100%                  1.265
&gt;
&gt;           12.45                 75%                  1.225
&gt;
&gt;           12.24                 50%                  1.190
&gt;
&gt;           12.06                 25%                  1.155
&gt;
&gt;           11.89                  0%                  1.120
&gt;
&gt;Note:  If the temperature of the electrolyte is below 70 degrees F, then
&gt;add .012 volts (12 millivolts) per degree below 70 degrees F.
&gt;
&gt;     D.  If the battery's state-of-charge is at 75% or higher, then load
&gt;test the battery by one of the following methods:
&gt;
&gt;          1.  Turn the headlights on high beam for six minutes,  
&gt;
&gt;          2.  Disable the ignition and turn the engine over for 15 
&gt;                seconds with the starter motor, 
&gt;
&gt;          3.  With a battery load tester, apply a load equal to one half
&gt;                of the Cold Cranking Amp (CCA) rating of the battery, or
&gt;
&gt;          4.  With a battery load tester, apply a load equal to one half 
&gt;                the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) cranking amp 
&gt;                specification.
&gt;
&gt;DURING the load test, the voltage on a good battery will NOT drop below
&gt;9.7 volts with the electrolyte at 80 degrees F.  (If the electrolyte
&gt;is above 80 degrees, add .1 volt for every 10 degrees above 80 until you
&gt;reach 100 degrees.  If below 80 degrees, subtract .1 volt for every 10
&gt;degrees until 40 degrees.)  After the load is removed, the battery should
&gt;&quot;bounce back&quot; to the 50% state-of-charge level or above.  If the battery
&gt;drops below minimum test voltage, does not bounce back or will not start
&gt;the engine, then you should replace it.  If it passes this test, you
&gt;should recharge your battery to restore it to peak performance.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;4.  HOW DO I KNOW IF MY CHARGING SYSTEM IS OK?
&gt;
&gt;When the charging system fails, usually the alternator light will come on.
&gt;With a good battery and the engine running at 2000 RPM or more for two
&gt;minutes, depending on the load and ambient temperature, the voltage will
&gt;increase to between 13.0 and 15.1 volts.  Other factors affecting the
&gt;charging voltage are the battery's age, state of charge, and electrolyte
&gt;level and purity.  A loose alternator belt will significantly reduce the
&gt;alternator's output.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;5.  HOW DO I JUMP START MY CAR?
&gt;
&gt;This assumes a 12 volt negative grounded system found on almost every car
&gt;in the United States.
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Determine that the electrolyte is NOT frozen.  If frozen, allow
&gt;to thaw.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Turn off all unnecessary accessories and lights on both cars.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Start the car with the good battery and let it run for at least
&gt;two or three minutes at fast idle BEFORE attempting to start the disabled
&gt;car.
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Connect the POSITIVE terminal on the disabled battery to the
&gt;POSITIVE terminal on the good battery.
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Connect the NEGATIVE terminal on the good battery to a clean,
&gt;unpainted area on the ENGINE BLOCK on the disabled car.
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Let the good car to continue to run for five minutes or more.
&gt;This will allow the dead battery to receive some charge and to warm it's
&gt;electrolyte. 
&gt;
&gt;     G.  Start the disabled car and allow to run at fast idle.
&gt;
&gt;     H.  Disconnect the jumper cables in the reverse order, starting with
&gt;the ENGINE BLOCK on the disable car.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;6.  WHAT DO I LOOK FOR IN BUYING A NEW BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Cold Cranking Amps
&gt;
&gt;The most important consideration is the battery's CCA rating.  CCAs are
&gt;the discharge load measured in amps that a fully charged battery at 0
&gt;degrees F can deliver for 30 seconds and while maintaining the voltage
&gt;above 7.2 volts.  Batteries are sometimes advertised by their Cranking
&gt;Amps (CA) measured at 32 degrees or Hot Cranking Amps (HCA) measured at 80
&gt;degrees, which are not the same as CCA.  Do not be mislead by CAs or HCAs.
&gt;To convert CAs to CCAs, multiply the CAs by .8.  To convert HCAs to CCAs,
&gt;multiply HCAs by .69.  In hot climates, buying batteries with double or
&gt;triple the CCA ratings that exceed the OEM requirement is a WASTE of
&gt;money.  However, in colder climates the higher CCA rating the better, due
&gt;to increased power required to crank a sluggish engine and the
&gt;inefficiency of the cold battery.  One of the major manufacturers, Exide,
&gt;publishes the following table:
&gt;
&gt;      Available Power        Temperature        Power Required
&gt;       From Battery           degrees F         To Crank Engine
&gt;
&gt;           100%                  80                  100%
&gt;
&gt;            65%                  32                  155%
&gt;
&gt;            40%                   0                  210%
&gt;
&gt;            25%                 -32                  350%
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Reserve Capacity  
&gt;
&gt;The next most important consideration in buying a battery is the Reserve
&gt;Capacity (RC) rating because of the effects of an increased parasitic or
&gt;&quot;key off&quot; load produced by electrical devices, e.g., fans, clocks,
&gt;computers, etc., that operate after the engine is stopped.  RC is the
&gt;number of minutes a fully charged battery at 80 degrees F can be
&gt;discharged at 25 amps until the voltage falls below 10.5 volts.  More RC
&gt;is better in every case.  For example, if your car has a 360 OEM cranking
&gt;amp requirement, then a 450 to 500 CCA rated battery with 120 minute RC
&gt;would be more desirable in a warm climate than one with 700 to 800 CCA with
&gt;90 minutes of RC.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Type
&gt;
&gt;A sealed or &quot;maintenance free&quot; battery will NOT allow you to test the
&gt;specific gravity with a hydrometer or add DISTILLED water when required.
&gt;Sealed batteries are more prone to deep discharge failures, but require
&gt;less preventative maintenance.  Car batteries are specially designed for
&gt;high initial cranking amps (usually for five seconds) to start a car;
&gt;whereas, deep cycle or &quot;marine&quot; batteries are designed for prolonged
&gt;discharges at lower amperage.  A &quot;dual marine&quot; battery is a compromise
&gt;between a car and deep cycle battery.  However, a CAR battery will give
&gt;you the best performance in a car.  Some manufactures have introduced a
&gt;&quot;dual&quot; battery that combines a standard battery with emergency backup
&gt;cells.  For about the same cost a better approach is to buy two batteries
&gt;and isolate them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Size
&gt;
&gt;Manufacturers build their batteries to an internationally adopted BCI
&gt;group number (24F, 35, etc.) specification, which is based on the physical
&gt;case size, terminal placement and terminal polarity.  The OEM battery
&gt;group number is a good starting place to determine the replacement
&gt;group.  Within a group, the CCA and RC ratings, warranty and battery type
&gt;will vary in models of the same brand or from brand to brand.  Batteries
&gt;are generally sold by model, so the group numbers will vary for the same
&gt;price.  This means that for the SAME price you can potentially buy a
&gt;physically larger battery with more RC than the battery you are replacing.
&gt;Be sure that the replacement battery will fit, the cables will correct to
&gt;the correct terminal, and that the terminals will NOT touch the hood when
&gt;closed.
&gt;
&gt;The battery manufacturers publish application guides that will contain the
&gt;OEM cranking amp and group number replacement recommendations by make,
&gt;model and year of car, and battery size, CCA and RC specifications.
&gt;Manufacturers might not build or the store might not carry all the group
&gt;numbers.  To reduce inventory costs, dual terminal &quot;universal&quot; batteries
&gt;that will replace several group sizes are becoming more popular.  The four
&gt;largest domestic battery manufacturers are Johnson Controls (Interstate,
&gt;Motorcraft, Energizer, older Diehards), Delco (Sears, newer Diehards), GNB
&gt;(Champion) and Exide (NAPA).
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Freshness
&gt;
&gt;Determining the &quot;freshness&quot; of a battery is sometimes difficult.  NEVER
&gt;buy a battery that is MORE than SIX months old.  The date of manufacture
&gt;is stamped on the case or printed on a sticker.  It is usually a
&gt;combination of alpha and numeric characters with letters for the months
&gt;starting with &quot;A&quot; for January (skipping &quot;I&quot;) and digit for the year, e.g.,
&gt;&quot;F5&quot; for June, 1995.  Like bread, fresher is definitely better.
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Warranty
&gt;
&gt;As with tire warranties, battery warranties are not necessarily indicative
&gt;of the quality or cost over the life of the car.  Manufacturers will
&gt;prorate warranties based on the LIST price, so if a battery failed half
&gt;way or more through its warranty period, buying a NEW replacement might
&gt;cost you less.  The exception is the free replacement warranty period.
&gt;This represents the risk that the manufacturer is willing to assume.  A
&gt;longer free replacement warranty period is better.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;7.  HOW DO I INSTALL A BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Thoroughly wash and clean the old battery, battery terminals and
&gt;case or tray with water to minimize problems from acid or corrosion.
&gt;Heavy corrosion can be neutralized with a mixture of baking soda and
&gt;water.  Auto parts stores sell a cheap wire brush that will allow you to
&gt;clean the inside of a terminal clamps.  Mark the positive cable so you do
&gt;not forget which one it is when you reconnect.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Remove the NEGATIVE cable first, the POSITIVE cable and then the
&gt;hold-down bracket or clamp.  Dispose the old battery by exchanging it when
&gt;you buy your new one or at a recycling center.  Batteries contain large
&gt;amounts of lead and acid.  
&gt;
&gt;     C.  After removing the old battery, be sure that the battery tray and
&gt;cable connectors are clean.  If the cables are corroded or damaged,
&gt;replace them; otherwise, they will significantly reduce starting
&gt;capability.
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Place the replacement battery so that the NEGATIVE cable will
&gt;connect to the NEGATIVE terminal.  Reversing the polarity of the
&gt;electrical system WILL severely damage it.  
&gt;
&gt;     E.  After replacing the hold-down bracket, reconnect the POSITIVE
&gt;cable first and then the NEGATIVE cable.  
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Before starting the engine, check the electrolyte levels and
&gt;state-of-charge and refill or recharge as required.  
&gt;
&gt;     G.  Coat the terminals with a high temperature grease to prevent
&gt;corrosion.
&gt;
&gt;If you do not want to lose your car's computer memory, security codes or
&gt;radio settings, a second battery can be temporarily connected to the
&gt;electrical system in parallel before disconnecting the first one.  A
&gt;cigarette lighter plug can easily connect a parallel battery.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;8.  HOW DO I CHARGE MY BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;Some more words of caution.  Do NOT ever disconnect a battery cable from
&gt;car with the engine running because the battery acts like a filter for the
&gt;electrical system.  Unfiltered electricity can damage the electrical
&gt;components, for example, computer, radio, etc.  Check the electrolyte level
&gt;before recharging.  Do NOT add water if the electrolyte is covering the
&gt;top of the plates because during the recharging process, it will warm up
&gt;and expand.  After recharging has been completed and the electrolyte has
&gt;cooled, RECHECK the level and add DISTILLED water to 1/8&quot; BELOW the bottom
&gt;of the filler tube (vent wells) or to the level indicated by the battery
&gt;manufacturer.  Reinstall the vent caps before recharging and recharge ONLY
&gt;in well ventilated areas.  NO smoking, sparks or open flames because while
&gt;being recharged, batteries give off explosive gasses.  If your battery is
&gt;the sealed, do NOT recharge with high current.
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Usually, a car is jump started and run to recharge the battery,
&gt;which might NOT fully charge it.  The length of time to fully recharge the
&gt;battery depends on the amount of discharge, the amount of surplus current
&gt;that is diverted to the battery, how long the engine is run, RPM, and
&gt;temperature.  That is, an alternator is sized by the car manufacturer to
&gt;carry the maximum accessory load and maintain a battery, NOT recharge a
&gt;dead one.  If you jump start your car, test your battery after you have
&gt;finished driving it, and recharge if the state-of-charge is below 75%.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  A better method to recharge batteries is to use an external
&gt;constant current charger which is set not to deliver more than 1% of the
&gt;CCA rating of the battery.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  The best method is to use an external constant voltage or tapered
&gt;current charger.  A constant voltage &quot;automatic&quot; charger applies regulated
&gt;voltage at approximately 14.6 volts.  A 10 amp automatic charger will cost
&gt;between $30 and $50 at an auto parts store.  To prevent damage to the
&gt;battery, the current should be less than 1% of the CCA rating during the
&gt;first 30 minutes.  With a taper charger, a high current, up to 30 amps, is
&gt;applied to the battery for a short period up to 30 minutes maximum and
&gt;then is regulated downward until the charge state reaches 100%.
&gt;
&gt;For batteries with a state-of-charge of 25%, the following table,
&gt;published by Interstate Batteries, lists the recommended battery charging
&gt;rates and times:
&gt;
&gt;     Reserve Capacity            Slow Charge          Fast Charge
&gt;       (RC) Rating                _at_ 5 Amps             _at_ 20 Amps
&gt;
&gt;     80 Minutes or less           10 Hours             2.5 Hours
&gt;
&gt;     80 to 125 Minutes            15 Hours              4 Hours
&gt;
&gt;     125 to 170 Minutes           22 Hours              5 Hours
&gt; 
&gt;If left unattended, cheap, unregulated trickle battery chargers can
&gt;overcharge your battery, because they can &quot;boil off&quot; the electrolyte.  Do
&gt;NOT use fast, high rate, or boost chargers on any battery that is sulfated
&gt;or deeply discharged.  This condition requires a constant current from one
&gt;to two amps for 60 to 100 hours.  The electrolyte should NEVER bubble
&gt;violently while recharging.  High currents only create heat and excess
&gt;gas.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;9.  CAN I INCREASE THE LIFE OF MY BATTERY?
&gt;
&gt;Keeping your battery well maintained is the BEST way to extend the life of
&gt;your battery.  For cold climates, keeping the battery fully charged and
&gt;warm will help.  In the warmer climates and during the summer, the
&gt;electrolyte levels need to be checked more frequently and DISTILLED water
&gt;added, if required.  Batteries last approximately two thirds as long in
&gt;hot climates as cold ones.  The parasitic load will determine how long a
&gt;car can sit and still be started.  Disconnecting the NEGATIVE cable will
&gt;extend the &quot;life&quot; of the battery.  Turning off unnecessary accessories and
&gt;lights BEFORE starting your car will decrease the load on the battery
&gt;while cranking.  Leaving your lights on and fully discharging the battery
&gt;can ruin it, especially if it is the sealed or maintenance free type.
&gt;Should this occur, you should test the battery after it has been recharged
&gt;to determine if there is permanent damage.  NEVER add acid or
&gt;additives--just water.
&gt;
&gt;Maintaining the correct electrolyte levels, tightening loose hold-down
&gt;clamps and terminals, and removing corrosion is normally the ONLY
&gt;preventative maintenance required for a battery.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;10.  WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF BATTERY FAILURES?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Using an undersized battery,
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Loss of electrolyte due to heat or overcharging,
&gt;
&gt;     C.  Overcharging with voltages greater than 15.1 volts,
&gt;
&gt;     D.  Undercharging,
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Old age,
&gt;
&gt;     F.  Vibration,
&gt;
&gt;     G.  Deep discharges (leaving your lights on),
&gt;
&gt;     H.  Using tap water,
&gt;
&gt;     I.  Corrosion,
&gt;
&gt;     J.  Freezing, and 
&gt;
&gt;     K.  Overheating.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;11.  WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERIES?
&gt;
&gt;     A.  Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them.
&gt;
&gt;Modern lead acid battery cases are better sealed, so external leakage
&gt;causing
&gt;discharge is no longer a problem.
&gt;
&gt;     B.  Driving a car will fully recharge a battery.  
&gt;
&gt;There are a number of factors affecting alternator's ability to charge a
&gt;battery.  The greatest factors are how much current from the alternator is
&gt;diverted to the battery to charge it, how long the current is available
&gt;and temperature.  Generally, short trips during bad weather will not
&gt;recharge the battery; whereas, a long daytime drive in good weather will.
&gt;
&gt;     C.  A battery will not explode.  
&gt;
&gt;While recharging, a battery produces hydrogen and oxygen gasses.  If a
&gt;spark occurs, an explosion can occur.  Remember the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;!
&gt;
&gt;     D.  A battery will not lose it's charge sitting in storage.  
&gt;
&gt;A battery has internal electrical leakage that will cause it to become
&gt;fully discharged and sulfated over time.  Prior to storing a battery, it
&gt;should be fully charged and recharged when it reaches the 50%
&gt;state-of-charge level.  Batteries on store shelves should be checked
&gt;periodically and recharged if necessary.
&gt;
&gt;     E.  Maintenance free battery never requires electrolyte.  
&gt;
&gt;In warm climates, the electrolyte could be &quot;boiled off&quot; due to the high
&gt;underhood temperatures.  It could also be lost due to excessive charging
&gt;voltage or using high charging currents.
