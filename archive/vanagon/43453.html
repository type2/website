Subject: IRS Conversions?


 I asked this question about 2 months ago or so and I don't recall ever 
getting a response.  I am new to busses.  I have a 66 that I bought which 
I still need to go pick up and bring home.  I remember though, that by 
looking underneath, it had the reduction boxes on it.  Now I hear about 
these IRS conversions that in effect, remove the boxes, but doesn't that 
take away the mechanical advantage?  I would tend to think that it would 
make the engine work harder to move the bus along.  Thanks for any input 
in this regard...
