&gt;I see in the Parts Place catalogue that new generic three wire sensors are

&gt;as good as the Bosch? The Bosch sensor is about $130.00.

I use the generic replacements myself.  Local FLAPS can provide these
sensors.  Standard makes a number of three wire sensors in this price range.
 Make sure sensor has 2 white and 1 black wire.  The sensors with 3 different
colors as used on some chryslers will not work on the VW.  BTW, earlier
Vanagons can be equipped with the 3 wire sensors.  This will provide more
reliable operation, especially in cold weather or extended idling.  Hook up
heater wires to switched 12 volt supply.
