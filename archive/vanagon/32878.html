Subject: Re: Heat

nice explanation on heat types, Dave.

ditto the comments on the gas fired cattle-lick-it heater... they are 
a bugger to light (DO NOT light one of these things in a van!!!  even 
Bradley).  kinda like Chevy Chase lighting a charcoal grill.

and oh.  any one want to buy a used Coleman catalytic heater?  gas 
fired of course.  uhhh..... cheap.
