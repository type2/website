Subject: My Syncro Locking Diff is Possessed 

I don't know if other Syncronauts have had this experience, but...
my rear locking diff is *POSSESSED*!  &lt;Add your appropriate 
eerie sound here :-)&gt;

Symptoms: For no apparent reason, the locking diff will activate.
The LED indicator will turn on and the rear is locked. There is no
correlation with the speed of the vehicle nor with whether the
vehicle is turning. Sometimes it will stay active for 10 seconds
and then go off. Other times it will activate for for more than 5
minutes.

Playing with the switch has no affect. This afternoon my wife 
was driving and it activated a couple miles from home. She drove
into the driveway and waited for me to get home. Four hours later I
started it and it was still activated, even though the switch was
in the off position. During my short drive around the block, it
activated and deactivated four times.

I need to exorcise the demon out of this Syncro. Short of calling a
priest, does anyone have any *serious* suggestions on what may
be the problem? 

(I know this is the vanagon list and some levity is expected, but
this is a *real* problem. It can't be driven until I get this fixed.)

I am posting from  my private ISP account. I don't subscribe to
vanagon_at_lenti from this account so please reply either to 
the list or to my daytime account: djenkins_at_foxboro_dot_com.

Thanks for any info.
