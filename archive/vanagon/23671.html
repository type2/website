Subject: Gene Berg Stroke victim!

Not confirmed, but heard that Gene Berg had a stroke during the last work
week and is in the hospital without the ability to speak. I don't know the
man on a beer drinking buddy basis but I personnally hope he is doing OK. I
know he has stepped on a few toes over the years and everyone has an opinion
about the man but let's wish him well anyway. No reason to beat a guy while
he's down. Please hold the synisism.
