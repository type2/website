Tim Smith, blowing smoke again:

&gt; &gt;If my name and email address has been passed on from V_at_L to a 3rd party
&gt; &gt;I want it removed from any newly created list. The distribution of mailing
&gt; &gt;lists without express permission of the members is something generally
&gt; &gt;frowned upon. I trust you will have no problem complying with this removal
&gt; &gt;request Ron.

This is misleading. Nobody is &quot;distributing the mailing list&quot;. And it is
not &quot;generally frowned upon&quot; to have public review of a list roster; most
lists have this, v_at_l has had it since I've been keeping track, type2 had it
until we changed servers recently, and there are several legitimate reasons
for doing it that way.

Your email addresses are not being &quot;passed on&quot; to a third party. In the
case of the aircooled list, Bus Depot and BusBoys are cleared to pull down
the roster in order to *and only in order to* check whether somebody is
really a listee. Most people can't get at the roster.

In the case of the watercooled list, v_at_l has always had open review. Ron
checked with Gerry and it was announced to you as a matter of courtesy. Any
vendor could have done it without anybody's permission. That ought to tell
you something about the kind of vendors these are; they're public about all
of this.

This is not being done so that vendors can spam you. If either of these
vendors spams you, let me know and I will personally see to it that that
vendor suffers ceaseless torture.

This is being done only so that you can get discounts on parts. People with
busses need discounts on parts. As much as I love them, busses break a lot.
At least mine does. ;)

Tim, my integrity isn't up for grabs. You have a personal, inexplicable
vendetta against Ron Salmon that cannot be explored without the service of
a capable psychologist. You don't want a discount, that's fine with me. But
if you insinuate that there's any subterfuge going on, on my part or
Gerry's, I will cheerfully staple you. Again. As often as I have to.
