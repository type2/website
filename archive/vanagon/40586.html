Hey Jim,

Don't forget to tell those VW fatcats that I'm interested in buying a CHEAP
RELIABLE LONG - LASTING VW.  Not one of those loaded to the gills with fancy
electric crap that breaks &amp; costs twenty grand VW.

Who would want one of those?  I'm not saying that they should build all of
their cars for me, but they haven't built one for me since the Fox.  I just
think that the VW trim levels should be more than just seat upholstery.  You
should be able to order a stripped car with just A/C or Automatic without
sunroof and power windows and power butt-scratchers and heads up displays and
such.

I refuse to pay for all that stuff in a &quot;package&quot;.  They should call it a
&quot;buy it and shut the hell up&quot; instead of a &quot;package&quot;.  That's the way it
feels to me when I'm told &quot;you can't buy it without the stereo and sunroof
and power windows.&quot; .  I would probably be taking delivery of my new Passat
TDI about now if they had let me have it my way.  I would have waited as long
as it took for it to get here from Belgique or der Vaterland.  If only it
were just the model, color, etc. that I wanted.  But, as long as VW tells me
that it knows what I want better than I do, I will be buying the old used VWs
and fixing them up with just the right options (the way they should have been
built).
