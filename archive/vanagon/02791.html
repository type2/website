WHACK!!! :)

&gt;I am curious as to whether anyone makes such reprogramming chips for
&gt;Vanagons? Something that would broaden a stock waterboxer's torque curve a
&gt;bit might really enhance driveability.

unless they have decided to do it in the last year, there ain't no hope. :(
i called Dinan and one other one (auto-tech?) and they just kinda snickered
when i said Digifant and Vanagon. :(  anybody know any different?
