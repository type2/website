Subject: Mirrors, Spark Plugs, Oil temp gauge

Now that the clutch and valve train have received their fixes, time to turn
my attention to four other items I'd like to get set before the 81 Westie
and my family start the summer excursions:

(1) Mirrors. I seem to recall some listalk about replacing the stock, rather
large and noisy mirrors with something smaller and more aerodynamic,
utilizing  the existing mounting holes, not looking too awful or pricey.
Would prefer manual to electronic. If somebody has suggestions, please let
me know.

(2) Oil Temp Gauge. I'd like to install a VDO Oil temp gauge, and would
appreciate advice in two areas: (a) placement of the sensing unit (I don't
want to do a dipstick sensor), and associated hardware/drilling required;
(b) routing the wires to the dash (my Westie has a gas heater and bellypan).

(3) Spark Plugs. Though I know this is one area where opinions abound, I
would appreciate advice on differing brands, platinum vs. non (those that
advocate &quot;splitfires&quot; need not apply). My (original) air-cooled engine has
about 82K, runs about 120 PSI across; runs 30-40 weight straight viscosity
oil in summer. The van is used for some minor (3-5) mile trips during the
week, and can see 300-500 mile trips in 80*F ambient temps routinely during
the dog-days of summer. So some healthy spark plug advice would be nice.

(4) High-Temperature Foam Padding. I think there was some recent discussion
re: foam of varying thickness that would withstand something like 500*F. As
my Westie has functioning A/C, and therefore some irregularly shaped
engine-tin cutouts. I'd like to stuff some of this to plug gaps between the
engine tin and the compressor. If somebody knows where I can order the
stuff, please let me know.

If some of these items have been beaten to death over the list, please
contact me private E-mail &lt;herman.40_at_osu_dot_edu&gt; if you'd care to help.

Thanks again.
