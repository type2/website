Subject: [F]   Vanagon's on T.V.


I don't remember who posted about the Hippies and there bus on 
Deep Shit Nine a coupla weeks ago, but did any of you folks see the
ER episode this week with the fat old guy who dies in the middle seat
of a mid eighties Vanagon?
You don't get to see much of the van, just an internal shot which
includes the dead guy and the A/C unit in front of him.


Cheers
