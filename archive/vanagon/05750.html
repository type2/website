&gt; Mail has been pretty quiet lately...anyway, I am wondering what might
&gt; cause a small transmission leak on an 82 vanagon. The leakage is at or
&gt; near the front (read towards the front of the Van) but is not coming from
&gt; the fill plug. About six months I changed the fluid to 80W90 and iit was
&gt; fine until temps started to get cooler.Could this be partly due to the
&gt; thickness of the oil? I haven't seen many transmissions that don't leak so
&gt; I am not worried; just looking for advice or info.DC 

Oh no! Hope it's not the same thing that happened to my '67. Check to
see if it is coming out the nose cone where the shifter comes out. If
so, bad news. Ijust refill the trans. oil after long trips, and am
waiting until I have to pull the entire transaxle for something else to
replace the seal/bushing. Hopefully yours is something else.
