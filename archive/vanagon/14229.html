&gt; 
&gt; Went for safety this morn and we failed on a few small items (already fixed)
&gt; and one potentially bigger item: loose king pins.
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't played with them yet (which means they may be tightenable?),
&gt; but what are my options re replacement?  New? Remanufactured? ???
&gt; 
&gt; What can I expect to pay for these animals under the various options?
&gt; 
    In '92 I replaced the king and link pin suspension on 
my '66 camper for $403.75 (+$100 core charge) for a 
rebuilt set from Bus Boys Inc. Took an afternoon to replace 
and you get a real good chance to do that dreaded brake 
work that needs to be done.  I was real satisfied 
until after 1 1/2 years a couple of the rubber seals on the 
link pins have broken and fallen off, now I just make sure 
I keep it greased real well to keep water out.
