&gt;once i get the gasket all situated, i get some 3M Heavy Duty Drip Check (in
Do you get this at a glazier's?

&gt;a tube) and squeeze it under the gasket flap next to the body metal on the
&gt;outside. this stuff is just some grey fluid putty that fills in any gaps
&gt;between the rubber and the body and keeps the water from getting in there.
&gt;
&gt;it's hard as hell to describe it ... and i don't expect you to be able to
&gt;make sense of what i wrote. once you've seen it done, it's like 'Oh!'. but
I have seen it done with a windshield, so I know what you mean.  The shop
used jump rope- about 1/4&quot; diameter, and smooth.  Your suggestion of a broom
handle is an improvement.

&gt;do be very careful with that aluminum frame. i found out the hard way that
&gt;is very soft, and trying to pry the frame out with a screwdriver is NOT a
&gt;good idea!
&gt;
&gt;well, anyway, that's about it. if you have any questions, let me know. i have
&gt;an article from HOT VWs that has pictures, if you want a copy to look at.
&gt;
&gt;hope it helps.
Thanks, joel.
