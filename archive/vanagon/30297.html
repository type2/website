So sherwin_at_gnn_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; Need help, I'm dripping antifrz on the right side facing the rear 
&gt; of the 86 Westy synchro, the tanks and water pump are on the other 
&gt; side. If it's the head does Barrsleak work, is there a freeze out 
&gt; plug on the engine near the head?

Just make sure that it *is* the head.  It just might be the hose that
runs from the high pressure tank cap (I think it's that one)  where it
connects into the system on the right side.  Mine has started a small
leak there.  When I get home from my temporary assignment, I'll fix
mine.

I've read a few posts that say Barsleak works.  Some have posted that
it might clog the radiator works, but one of the other posters Steve T.???
said he's gotten mucho miles after with no trouble.
