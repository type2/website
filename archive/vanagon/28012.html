Subject: re:  Free(?) VW History Book (sorry, all gone)


&gt;I called the vw ag #  (1-800-444-8987)  and they did indeed say they'd send 
a
&gt;history book.   Also a video.   Also there is a commemorative piece of
&gt;artwork (subtle ad?)   showing  a split screen bus with a tear coming out 
of
&gt;one headlight,  and 'Jerry Garcia,  1942-1995'.

After seeing this post, I immediately called that 800 number, and spoke
to a lady named Rose. She said that the history book is no longer
available. But the video still is. She also said that the commemorative
artwork is not from VWoA, but done by some magazine (I think it was the
cover of Rolling Stone the week after Jerry died?).
