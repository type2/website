Subject:      Brake fade vs. automatic tranny

     Hmmmm.

     My '91 seems to do pretty good holding itself back with the automatic;
     'course one shouldn't downshift at too high a speed.  I used this
     braking feature a lot on the &quot;Mission Dollar Highway&quot; between
     Silverton and Ouray CO earler this summer.

     So, if downshifting an automatic produces less than ideal results,
     does it mean you need to perhaps replace the torque converter?
     (Rhetorical question - I don't need an answer)
