Subject: Re: scooter car query /tax in UK

The bizaare tax in UK rated tax as a function of Horsepower
This was calculated as a function of the bore aor diameter of the piston.
This caused early UK cars to have long-stroke engines that for the same cc's
gave a much higher oiston speed than the current over-square engines.
