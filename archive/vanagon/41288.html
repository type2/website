Subject: wanted: rear VW emblem for '88

Haven't found one at a wrecker yet, but I was all excited yesterday
after calling the dealer &amp; having them tell me they had it for $13!
I got there &amp; suddenly the price had become $55, and they wouldn't 
budge regardless of what I had been told on the phone.

So, if anyone has an emblem for rear hatch on '88 up Vanagon, please 
let me know. I think they're larger than the pre-86? models.

Also called dealer today to get price for city water and AC hookup 
covers (just for laughs), after seeing recent posts about them. Since 
it's friday, here's the prices:
AC 110V $189 CDN
City Water $ 145 CDN

It's amazing these dealers sell *anything*!
