&gt; I have a 85 Vanagon camper engine I Am pulling out for a subaru 
&gt; transplant. it is a 1.9, high miles, And the exhaust pipes are shot.
&gt; It does NOT leak, just passed it's smog check, and could use a
&gt; lifter if you let it sit too long. It was rebuilt at 80-90 thou, and
&gt; now has 131 on it. no knocks, and not a smoker.. Catalytic is good,
&gt; muffler fair.
