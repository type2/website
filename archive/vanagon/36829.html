Subject: Are there any new EV's in Mexico

With all the talk about watercooled loafs in Mexico, are there any new 
Eurovans forsale in Mexico?  If there are, would they be that difficult 
to bring into the US?

I'm really getting bummed about the strong possibility that there will 
not be anymore new EV's sold in the US. (Except for the Winnie things.)
