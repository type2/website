Subject: 81/82 Westy differences
Date: Sun, 24 Sep 95 17:39:21 EDT

We don't get many air-cooled vanagons in these parts, so when I saw an 81
Westphalia parked out at the University I thought I'd check it out. Apart
from the body being in rough shape - here are some differences between the
two years: a) plastic intake air vents replaced steel vent on 81; b) dash
vent controls of three on the 81 instead of 4 on later years; c) the rear
bench seat ran the  width of the van and instead of there being the stash
boxes to the left of the rear seat there is a jump seat  just
in front and perpendicular to the
bench; d) the 81 seemed higher but that could be my imagination.

The owner also installed an electric oil heater which replaced the regular
sump
plate. It looked a lot like an upside down hot plate. Neat idea and easy
to install.
