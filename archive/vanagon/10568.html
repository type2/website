I can explain why Greg was shouting.  I have been bouncing him some 
messages from the group.  It seems that a reply to me made it to the 
group for that reason.  I will have to get on him about the use of his
mailer.  BTW, this is the guy I was asking questions for on the '81 
westy last week.  We get to drive it around the east chasing bike 
racers this summer, if I can find a way to get there.  Anyways, sorry 
for the trouble, I will get him straight.  When he has more time I am 
sure he will be amongst us.  Oh, he always shouts, don't have to think
about the caps key then, I guess.
