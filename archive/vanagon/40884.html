&gt; 1. Do bus semaphores slide into the U shaped mounting point like a bug or do
&gt; they have a screw hole on the top and the bottom?

My '54 has a slit for the top of the semaphore, and a screw hole on the bottom.
The bug semaphore slipped right in.

&gt; 2. Why would I NOT have the flattened U rentention thingus in the semaphore
&gt; mounting holes?

Someone yanked 'em?

&gt; 3. Do ALL semaphore body slots have a 1/8&quot; rounded edge of body metal around
&gt; the outside of it or are some (any?) flat/sharp edged?

I would imaging they all do.  Flat/sharp ones may be some hack, which might
explain the lack of the tab inside...
