I've taken that all apart and checked it out and I'm fairly confident that
the bleeder screw is not leaking. I put some teflon tape around it too. I'm
going to look at it again this long weekend.  I could be wrong.  Your
description of where the coolant collects makes me suspicious.  Can I get
another bleeder screw by itself from the dealer? 


&gt; 	1) Remove the rear bench seat.  Makes life much more pleasant.

HOW DO YOU DO THAT! Wow, that WOULD make it easier, but I couldn't see an 
easy way to get it out.


&gt; 	2) Look for evidence of a coolant trail dripping from the bleeder screw.
&gt; 	   If present, replace bleeder screw.

&gt; 	3) Disassemble the black plastic housing (requires six hands and five
&gt; 	   screw drivers :) leaving just the heater core attached to the two
&gt; 	   heater hoses.

That's an odd way to do it. I clamped off the hoses and pulled the whole 
thing out.  However, your way would sure show me if there was a leak 
while it was running.  It's a small leak however and might not be noticed 
just in normal running.  It would also save me the hassle of bleeding the 
system each time.


&gt; 	4) Clean up any coolant and let the heater core set on a towel for
&gt; 	   several days with the flow through valve set open so coolant will
&gt; 	   flow through the heater core.  It probably took 5 days for coolant
&gt; 	   to stop dripping from my heater core fins.  The stuff just will
&gt; 	   not evaporate.
&gt; 	5) If your convinced that the heater core is leaking drop me some 
&gt; 	   email and maybe we can work out deal with my brand-new-never-been-
&gt; 	   installed-still-in-the-box heater core.


I'm going to tear it apart again and I may contact you on that very soon.
Thanks a million for your tips!
