Hi,

	As an act of desperation, I ran CLR thru my brake lines this weekend.
I disconnected the lines and put tupperware bowls under them.  

	The next mornning, I got some chunk looking pieces of junk, but when 
I went to pick some up out of the soup, they disintegrated.  I think this is
because of the CLR 

	BTW CLR is a mild phosphoric acid solution, used for removing calcium,
lime and rust, hence the name.

	On the downside, my brakes still don't release the pressure, _and_ the
pedal feels soft, although I didn't bleed them at all afterwards.   I think
I might try this again, and leave it in longer and see what happens....

Thom
