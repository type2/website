Trying to remember my old '72.  It had lots of metal so you should be 
able to.  Looked under the EV front end.  Don't look promising.  ON the 
EV though maybe a winch that isn't 'attached' per se but instead hooks to 
the 'tow' hook and only has a electrical umbilical....  (Does that make 
any sense?)

I'd think the front bumber mounts could somehow be used on the bus, the 
bumber itself might be a little weak.  But I'm really only guessing.
