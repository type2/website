Saw both Gerry's and Cetin's post regarding diesel vanagons.

Summary of my experiences regarding performance and milage - my van is a plain
7 passenger model, and has very consistantly gotten 30+ mpg, in town ,  on
trips, loaded to the max with more stuff and family than any of you might
rationaly believe, or unloaded just running around town as well as any/all 
combinations of the above.

The only time I had soot deposits was when the original engine was reaching
&quot;end life&quot; and blowby from the cylinders to the crankcase was forcing oil and
soot out.  A longblock took care of that.

Although I have had the van up to 65-70, I'm  not comfortable with prolonged
running at those revs/output power levels from this small powerplant.
