Harry's right. These noisy lifters are nothin to worry about. It goes away
after you drive around a little bit.

&gt;I was trying to be nice to my '84 Vanagon this winter by letting it relax ( 
&gt;I've 
&gt;been driving my '83 GTI. Unfotunately now when I start it (after a 2 week rest)
&gt;a lifter is making noise. This happened once before but after a few minutes
&gt;it went away.
&gt;This time it is not going away. Is there a way I can detrmine with some 
&gt;certainty exactly which lifter is bad. 
&gt;Also, does anybody have any experiences replacing lifters in a Waterboxer.
