Subject: Blown headgasket also on EV

Reading about problems with blown headgaskets, I can tell that it 
happens eurovans as well. My diesels temp gauge could show no temp at 
all, even after a hard run. Then after a while it started to smell 
coolant from the exhaust, so then I was sure something was wrong. I 
spoked to the mechanic who repaired my car, and he said that the 
headgasket was replaced now with a new type of gasket. My car had the 
earlier model of gasket, and this problem was common.
