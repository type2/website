Subject: Re: Sad story, from long ago....


&gt;	The family bus ('66 or '67) needed brake werk done.  They dropped 
&gt;it off to a local garage here in cambridge (back in the 70's) to get the 
&gt;job done.  When the dad came to pick it up it was nowhere on the lot. 
&gt;Inquiring as to where the vehicle was, the mechanic said &quot;You mean that old
&gt;green van?&quot;  I thought that was supposed to be crushed!
&gt;
&gt;Ouch.

I went through a transition a short while back from my 70 westy to a 71.  I
was able to use many of the parts off the 70 and I stored most of the other
useful stuff.  On the morning the junkyard tow truck was to pick up the 70,
it occured to me that I asked them to pick up a red bus (both were red).
Needless to say, I stood outside all morning waiting for the truck.

My personal sad bus story was hitting a deer with my 70.  I had dreams of
&quot;fixing it up&quot; but that big deer imprint on the sheetmetal (like the shroud
of Turin, except it was a deer on sheetmetal and not Jesus on a cloth) along
with its other shortcomings sealed its fate.
