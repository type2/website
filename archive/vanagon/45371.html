have you folks heard about the condition which causes burning of the 
valves due to loose valve guides, caused by &quot;poor octane&quot; ratings in the 
fuel being made today? I cannot beleive that a Machine shop cant STOP all
guides from getting loose with design, or rollpins or taper pins. You can 
make a 21 inch gun breech gas proof in any condition whats so hard about 
an 85 mm bore under much less compression? Can you clear up my 
understanding of the problem?
