Subject: Questions again.. :(

        I was just wondering if any of you veteran van campers could give
me an idea of how best to pack your van. Any tips that you could give at
all on things like:
- where best to store certain items
- how to keep things from banging around while your driving
- extra things that just us Westie camper people should maybe bring, or
that would be helpful.

        Im used to packing a small hatchback, so the &quot;stuff-it in till it
just wont stuff anymore&quot; technique may not work here.

        By the way I look at a bunch of peoples home pages who frequent the
mailing list, and I must say I was pretty impressed by some of the sites,
and the vans in the sites. I lost track of whos was whos but two that
really caught my eye were the one with a '63(?) Splittie, and the other was
the site dedicated to Synchro's. Nice work ___________ and ____________
(fill in appropriate names).

what we sow in tears
we reap in joy
