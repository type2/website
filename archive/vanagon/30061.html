Subject: Re: Vanagon snow performance



Having owned just about each one of these vehicles and having driven
them in snow/ice for long periods of time, here's my rating, from best
to worst:  (All vehicles below had standard transmission)


   Best, By Far:  '93 EV  (and the '85 Audi 5000)

   then,       :  '82 diesel westy (not much low end torque, well
		   distributed weight, lack of power steering also helps)

   then        :   73 Bus 

   then        :   '87 Weekender and the '73 SuperBug (too much low
		   end torque)


Having said this, remember, any single one of these are *much* better
than a LARB under any circumstance (I've driven those, too...)...

Of Course, I've also driven my '85 Renault Encore  around in
Pittsburgh snow -- I think the EV would be no match to the Renault
.. ( underpowered 1400 cc engine, narrow tires with good thread) in
Pittsburgh (those of you who know Pittsburgh's hills will know what
I'm talking about).
