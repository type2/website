Subject: west coast trip - need a ride


Looking for a ride down the coast to Martha's Flannel Jamboree. I am
located in Felton, about 12 miles off of Hwy 17. I have a tent that I
will be using, so I don't need a place to sleep. I generally read in a
car, so I should be quiet the whole trip (unless you want to talk).

Will be bringing:
dutch ovens - will try to make fresh sourdough bread in them. can be
              used for fish stew also. 10&quot; and 12&quot; sizes. just throw
              them on a bed of charcoal. lids can be places upside
              down on charcoal for a gridle (sourdough pancakes).
percolator  - makes one massive pot of coffee.
white gas stove - to perc that coffee.
games       - backgammon, cosmic wimpout
trail descriptions - there is a 13 mile trail that starts at the camp
                     site. not very far in is a 120' fall, split into
                     upper and lower, should be cool after all the
                     rain. after that is a great view of the coast.

should I bring tools also? plenty of sockets and misc other
stuff. along with the Bently and Muir manuals. don't have all the
know-how yet tho.

My Westy is non-operational, so please help this poor soul out :)
