In a message dated 96-09-16 18:25:58 EDT, you write:
&lt;&lt; 
 Sears 10HP lawn tractor, with the deck and everything.  With the jumpseats
 out, put the two ramps, and pushed the tractor up (in transverse position)
 into the middle cargo area.  &gt;&gt;

I carried an 18HP Sears lawn tractor - just removed the middle seat and used
car ramps and drove it in after removing the deck.  About 6&quot; hung out  so I
left the sliding door open and made sure it was roped in tight.  I put the
deck on top of the engine compartment.  I traveled about 40 mi. with it in
this position.
