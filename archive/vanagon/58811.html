&gt; Has anyone had experience using the H2O shower or other type of &quot;bags&quot; that
&gt;  are supposed to heat water for showers while camping?  We were thinking of
&gt;  using it by putting it the luggage area in front of the pop top and
letting
&gt;  the hose hang through the drivers window into the sink-when needed.  I'm
&gt;  sure it would warm enough for washing hands but what about dishes?

All depends on their exposure to the sun, air temperature, what the bag is
placed on, and the time allowed for heating.

Exposure to the sun, Air tmeperature, &amp; Time
Pretty simple.  Clouds &amp; shade really diminish the effectiveness, cool
weather diminishes the heating and the longer in the sun the warmer it'll get
- to a point.

What you might not consider strongly enough, is the surface the bag sits on.
 If you hang it or otherwise insulate it from the earth, the water
temperature can get VERY warm.  So warm in fact, that we've needed to mix
cold water in to take a shower. Be CAREFUL.

If you lay the bag on a rock or on the ground, you could have sun all day &amp;
night ( :-) and the water will only get moderately warm.  Much of the heat is
transfered directly into the rock/earth.

On th fiberglass top of a Westy would seem like a pretty good place for
heating.  The fiberglass is a relatively poor heat conductor, and there's an
air space between the fiberglass and the metal roof of the van right?

Also, the ones I've used are the relatively cheap variety available at
Walmart &amp; heated water quite effectively when positioned properly.
