Subject: single/double cab info

a buddy of mine is moving back out west (LA) and was interested in purchasing
a single - prefably double cab transporter.  anyone with any leads? u can
email me directly at 7039ckrah_at_umbsky.cc.umb_dot_edu.  What do these beasts go
for, and how available r they.  Anyone along the west coast (calif., oregon,
wash) is within range.   thanx in advance....
