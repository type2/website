Subject: Off to Transporters by the Tunnel


Ok, so its not as exciting as heading to Alaska, but the EV is fueled up, 
loaded up and at the crack of dawn we're headin' to LiMBO's Transporter's by 
the Tunnel in North Adamas, MA.

We'll have a report on monday...

The last of the Transporter Ale gets consumed tomorrow nite!!
;-)
