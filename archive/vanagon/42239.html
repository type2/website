Subject: Re: 79 bus (camper?) in RI ... for sale??

Well, it turns out I'm not going to be able to fix my '79 westy, and 
since I'm living out of it at the moment, I must sell it immediately.
It was running till a couple of days ago, and it's located in Fort 
Collins, CO.  The interior is in good shape, and there are a fair number 
of new parts, but it will need engine work.  The FI system and 
transmission are in fine shape as well.  I need to get back to the 
east coast in the next few days, so I'd like to sell it ASAP.  Please 
leave a 
message for me at (970) 484-7851 if you are even possibly interested.

Thanks,
david
