&gt; Consider an Interstate wheelchair battery.  Gel-cell, so no venting is
&gt; necessary and no liquid is present.  Small, so they easily fit under the

&gt; 
This was my choice too (small,safe,deeeep cycle, adequate amp/hours).
One word of warning: do NOT over-charge these gel cells. A typical
battery charger is designed to over-charge (16 volts I think). Some
top-end (expensive) battery chargers have a special settings just for
gel cells to limit the voltage (to around 13.5 volts). If you use the
circuit shown in your Bentley (with 40 amp relay) then there is no worry
that your alternator will cause any over-charge damage to the gel cell.
