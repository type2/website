Here is a question I am posting for a fiend with a 84
Vanagon.

	&quot;How do I eliminate side to side freeplay
	between contacts on the gear selection lever and 
	the contacts on the contact block on the other side
	so that it does not arc or need to be &quot;pushed&quot; to 
	the right to start on my 84 Vanagon autotranny, its 
	apparently developing a &quot;middle age spread&quot; over the years.&quot;


	Any thoughts on how to fix this would be appreciated.

	Jim Ferree
