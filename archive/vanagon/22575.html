Subject: J-Tube installation question

I've got a 71 bus (1600DP).  I've removed the heater boxes in favor of the 
j-tubes, but doing this necessitated removing the lower tin &quot;plates&quot; on each 
side, just below the push rod tubes.

Is this OK/normal?  There doesn't seem to be any way to remount these two tin 
pieces, as they fasten to the heater boxes.

It &quot;seems&quot; like this would have a positive impact on cooling, as the 
downward-moving air from the fan housing would seem to have an easier job 
getting the heat away from the cylinders this way, but I'm no thermal dynamics 
whiz (to say the least).

Just requesting a reality check that those plates didn't perform some magical 
heat-dissipating function.  (Seems just the opposite)

TIA,
