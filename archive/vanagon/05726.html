Subject: CA Smog Stuff

In CA the BUYER is responsible for obtaining a smog certificate even if
the vehicle was recently smogged e.g. registration was expired and owner
needed to resmog to reregister.  Smogging has to be done every other year
and mailed in with the reregistration payment.  BUT, in the past when
finding a vehicle I would work out a deal where I would purchase the
vehicle if the owner obtained the nedded smog certificate.  This is good
because the owner, if he/she knows the vehicle is in a certifiable state,
would be willing to do.  If you don't do this, once you buy it and go to
get it smogged, the buyer is responsible for repairs if needed to get it
smogged.
