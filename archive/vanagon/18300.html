&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;David,
&gt;&gt;   I'm real new to the list so forgive me if this is a FAQ &amp; I should
&gt;have known better...  My '81 Westy leaks oil like a sieve, I paid to have
&gt;&gt;push rod tube seals redone and it still leaks.  From the tone of your
&gt;&gt;note, this is not uncommon?  Thanks for any insights -
&gt;&gt;   Rick Harper

&gt;&gt;Rick and David,
	I own an 82 Westy  with 141K miles.  At 100K I was leaking a quart 
every 400 miles.   It was not the oil cooler, it was not the gasket at the 
oil filter bracket, it was not the crankcase seal.  I had to bench start the 
engine with no sheetmetal on it to find it.  It was the factory installed 
(supposedly permanently pressed in) oil galley plug. You know, where they 
drilled the hole for oil to flow to the main bearings in the case at the 
factory.  The plug was loose so I got a punch and peened the alluminum case 
material over the plug and it sealed fine.
However, now it is happening again at 141K ----probably a different oil 
galley plug.
Rick,    I think this is nothing but poor engineering but I doubt if we can 
do anything about it.

David and Rick 
	I am haveing problems with my vanagon again.  As mentioned, it leaks about a quart every 
2000 miles and I lost the valve seat on my new head again after only 40K miles.   Do you know where I 
can get a reliable head that won't fail?

Thanks,
