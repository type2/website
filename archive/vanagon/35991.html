    Is there any kind of oil spray or undercoating that's safe to use?
They don't recommend it in the manual for my '85, but the Canadian
Winter is taking its toll on my exhaust system! What's a good way to
protect it without having it melt or catch fire during those hot
summer drives to the cottage?
