&gt;Subject: more PC stuff...

&gt;Stand up and say, &quot;I'm a temporarily metabolically abled
&gt; pigmentally challenged fascistic oppressor and I accept
&gt; that through my ancestors, I am personally responsible for
&gt; all evil and unkindness ever introduced into the world!&quot;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;/martha

Uh, excuse me, but shouldn't there be some reference to
estrogen-deprived or some such in there somewhere?  Maybe it
just goes without saying that the testosterone-poisoned are
the only responible parties here.

Reminds me of the strip on the comics page the other day:

Man wearing T-shirt which reads &quot;I didn't do it&quot;

Wife saying &quot;Feeling particularly white male today?&quot;

Lest we forget that fascist white males gave us the VW 60
years ago.
