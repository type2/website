&gt;If I had to do this again, I think I would purchase the Optima, which I
&gt;believe fits in the tray (needs confirmation) and puts out 800 CCA and has
&gt;120 mins reserve capacity. The Optima is a sort of exotic design that is
&gt;supposed to charge up faster, be more able to withstand deep discharges, and
&gt;can be mounted upside down. Its popular in the 4x4 community. 

Can anyone confirm (by actual test) whether or not the Optima fits in a
standard Vanagon battery compartment?  These batteries appear to be prett
impresive, but I was under the impression that they won't fit a Vanagon.
