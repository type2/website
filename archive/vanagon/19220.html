Subject: Re: Bug Engine: Pros &amp; Cons?

&gt;    As you may recall, I am in the throes of impending overhaul syndrome, and
&gt;have a new decision to make. I have been offered a long block out of another
&gt;'71 Camper that rests behind a VW Dealership, with a history I do not know.
&gt;I'd probably just end up using the case and replacing the other parts.
&gt;    Well! My friend and yours (Ric), has offered up the engine from his '73
&gt;Super Beetle as a possible substitution! I have heard tid bits here and there
&gt;about this type of transplant, but I am wondering if you all might be able to
&gt;get more specific...
&gt;    What kind of modifications will we have to make?? I understand you need
&gt;some type of adapter...is this safe? easy? good? Also, is the engine from
&gt;that Beetle bigger than mine from my '71?? Will I have to switch other parts
&gt;over (i.e. generator, starter, etc...) to match it up??
&gt;    At least with this engine, I can be more positive about the history since
&gt;it belongs to a VW Guru, but I'd just like some more technical feedback
&gt;before I make the decision....
&gt;Thanks again!! Rach
&gt;
Rach,
The swap is possible but you have to mount the rear motor mount.There is
a kit that attaches to the oil pump (not the best way). If the case has
the mounting locations built in you can drill and tap these and the rear
mount will bolt right on.If these locations are there you can't use the 
adapter plate.you may also have trouble clearing the dual outlet tailpipes
with your bumper.Hope this helps.
