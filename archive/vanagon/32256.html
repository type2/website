You can purchase sheets of that &quot;fridge magnet&quot; stuff that has a real 
estate agents name on it and is holding up Billy's picture of a splitty 
in the kitchen right now, from art supply stores, and probably other 
places too...

And you can stick stickers to it. and cut around them.
 


ObVanagon, It's about -26C in the middle of the nights here, (-10to-15F 
I guess) and last year at about this time the little plastic junction 
that directs some of the coolant off to the rear heater shattered 
because of ice in it.  Lets keep our fingers crossed for all of the 
wasserboxers on the list, they're warm, but thats where the &quot;plusses&quot; 
run out.
