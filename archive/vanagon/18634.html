Subject: VW REPAIRS IN TORONTO

Can anybody suggest a good mechanic for my '77 camper in Toronto, Ontario??
I'm about to put some mega-miles on it this summer, and I feel that someone
reasonable competent should attend to those squeaky brake things, etc...
(i.e.  not me!).  I'll be taking it to Owasco's in Whitby unless I hear
otherwise.  Also - as I follow the setting sun this summer (read  out west -
Vancouver, some west coast), are there any 'musts' that I should be aware of ??
