Subject: RE: DASHBOARD ALTERS


&gt; 
&gt; I also have a portrait of Pee-Wee Herman filling the unused third
&gt; instrument hole in my dashboard.  Helps me keep my perspective....
&gt; 

In that portrait of yours, I don't even want to know what Pee-Wee is
using to fill the hole in your dashboard.  That's sick.  ;-)
P.S. - What kind of perspective does that help keep?
