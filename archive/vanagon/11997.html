Subject: Surgery Update

Just got back from the mechanic...he wanted to show me the pitted heads:0

While we were there (looking into the engine) most of the oil hoses (about 8)
were cracked and brittle from the Chicago winters (add another $14.00 each)

After much deliberation, we came to 3 choices concerning the heads:

1.  New (rebuilt) heads (can't afford them)

2.  Machine heads down (The heads are factory, so I'm sure there is a crack 
starting somewhere between the        valves, the increased compression 
would only make it worse, so that's out)

3.  Clean out the pits, seal them with &quot;Black&quot; silicone, then replace the 
heads (DING!)

The total so far (with the hoses) is $1,000.00 (he is throwing in the 
silicone sealant for free)
