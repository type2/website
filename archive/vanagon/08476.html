Subject: Re: easier shifting in the rain

There are two &quot;joints&quot; which need periodic greasing. The first is the
linkage at the front, most easily accessible by dropping the spare.
It resides in a shift linkage  box; the second is at the rear arm on the
trans. There is
normally a rubber boot which attaches to a large 17mil nut and the
ball joint therein. The bolt and boot can be removed for easy access. it
is likley the boot will have torn/disappeared  which may account for the
rain effect. BTW if you are having trouble shifting; the linkage can be
easily adjusted at the front. I had the whole shaft off once - it is done
by  a removing a clamp
at the front joining the longer of the shafts to the linkage from the
gear shift in the front box. By tilting the cabin shifter one way or the
other, reverse,
first and third can be made closer or further apart. Don't do this unless
you have the correct spacing for the adjustment (Haynes). Otherwise I can
send it. DC
