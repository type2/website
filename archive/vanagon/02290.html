Subject: Re: Best bike rack for vanagon

WE had a bike rack that fit on the back of the Westfalia and which would 
hold two bikes described as Joel has said. There is minimum wind resistance 
back there (unlike 
above the van). We drove back from CA that way without a problem. In a pinch 
you 
can lift up the rear hatch with the bikes attached and prop it up (ie to 
get at the engine in an emergency). There is so little wind resistance at 
the back 
that the straps are unecessary (the rack fits at a slight tilt so that 
bikes are inclined towards the van and will not fall off). We tried 
putting the bikes on top but this means mounting them vertically 
(difficult to remove) or horizontally (the wheels should be removed). We 
also tried mounting them at the front but the lack of an appropriate 
&quot;catch&quot; makes anything but a permanent mount difficult.


Since the rack folds into itself when not in use, it can be stored in the 
van.   Hope this helps - DC
