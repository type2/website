Subject: Re: Excellent book 'VW Bus-Camper-Van 1979-1989' (was Re: Time to upgrade...)



&gt;&gt; Now, its time to start doing my homework. Can anyone tell me of a
&gt;&gt; publication that describes and gives specifications of the various
&gt;&gt; Vanagon models since, say, 1985?
&gt;
&gt;Yes.
&gt;When I was getting a Peter Russek Manual for the watercooled Transporter
&gt;from VW Books, I asked the bookshop if they had anything else interesting
&gt;and they mentioned 'Volkswagen Bus-Camper-Van 1979-1989' by Brooklands 
&gt;Road Test Books.  It is a chronological set of articles about the 
&gt;Transporter from numerous publications around the world, compiled by R.M. 
&gt;Clarke. There are 100 A4-sized pages from 29 articles dating from 1979 to 
&gt;1989. Two or three by Road and Track I have seen in the archives. Other 
&gt;publications include Car, Autocar, Car &amp; Driver and VW Motoring. I would 
&gt;recommend this book to all Transporter enthusiasts and upgraders. I got 
&gt;mine from VW Books in Leicester, UK, Tel: 0044 116 286 6686. 

I'll second that recommendation.  Very informative and interesting book.   
I read it cover to cover.  It's available in the US from Rocky Mountain 
Motorworks, among others. (By the way, what's a Peter Russek Manual?)
