Subject: Baby Seat in Westfalia

My wife's off to an interview down south and she finally let me clamp the baby
seat in my '76. Wrestled with the seat belt on the folding rear seat until it
was about as snug as it was going to get, showed it to her for approval, she
thought it would be fine &quot;as long as you don't do any high speed cornering&quot; (I
love her but I don't think she's exactly grasped why I love my ride).

Anyway, got Mr. Beep (our 10 month old son, Flynn) ready to go this morning, he
recognized his car seat, wasn't quite sure about the huge space around him (the
Maxima is a *little* quieter than the Campmobile), but warmed up to the view in
no time. Put a BIG smile on my face to look in my rear view and see the little
guy back there.
