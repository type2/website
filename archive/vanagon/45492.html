Subject: MattyJ update

Got a call two-three weeks ago from &quot;MattyJ.&quot; He and his (very cute, way to
go J!) Nicole Kidmanish companion Suz were in Phoenix. Message on the
machine sounded like he was negotiating a private meeting with the Pope or
something. &quot;It would be an *honor* to meet you Mr. VanBondo...&quot; Cherry just
laughed at that one! =) Initially couldn't hook up for a visit. J&amp;Co. were
to explore GrandCanyon/North Rim and Bryce Wilderness etc. for five days.
Upon his/their return we got together for a couple of hours as we were
literally packing our '83 westy to bail for NewMexico for last weekend. The
said that thought there was a VW club meeting at the &quot;Rusty Ranch&quot; when
driving up. Shoot, they should have seen the other house when we had buses
around. Showed them the Resto from H. They insisted on photographing
Mrs.VanBondo and I standing in front of it (the bus) with promises of a web
sight of their expedition to be plunked together in the future.

Impression:
Very happy, positive, courteous, tidy, intelligent, and young folks who seem
to be enjoying themselves/each other very handily. Had great things to say
about the listees of whom they had already met. When asked if we actually
looked different than the &quot;VanBondos&quot; in their mind's eye. They replied with
the affirmative but they had grown used to it by that part of the Hobbit
adventure. For folks touring about in the early '70-ish westy with duct tape
and cargo straps holding the top down since February they were very
comfortable around each other and us. Sometimes, Cherry VanBondo and I get
ragged around the edges just going to the Circle K or 7-11 and back! =) I
recommend meeting up with these folks of you get a chance.

At last account they were headed through Tucson and southern NM slowly to
gravitate toward Taos and Colorado. I suspect that the desert heat might
intensify the gravitational pull to the cooler weather. 
Cheers!
