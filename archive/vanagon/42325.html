Subject: plating a 65' westy rack

I am in the process of looking for someone to do the (what i _assume_) is
the _correct_ zinc metal plating for the three &quot;u&quot; shaped metal support
channels for my westfalia roofrack that is going to go on my 65' bus.

two questions.

1. is zinc plating the &quot;correct&quot; OEM finish for these three metal &quot;bows&quot;,
&quot;support channels&quot; or whatever they are called

2. if zinc plating is correct does anyone have any advise on how one might
slect a plating shop to do the lpating?? what constitutes a good zinc
plating job??

any info is much appreciated!

michael
