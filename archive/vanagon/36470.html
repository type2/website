Subject: 	Re: RE: RE: Westfalia Tent Parts Wanted

well, ive got the one that attaches to the rain gutter- it is a long
aluminium strip that a'bead' of the tent slides into.

ive also got a couple pieces offth e roof of a 59 westy, that the tent stayed
in somehow.  That kind also had a bumper mount, i dont have it.

i want to keep the earlier knd, as i hope to get a 50s camper.

im in Olympia, wa,  (its the water)


Clara,

The earlier type is what i'm looking for.  

Thanks anyway,
Erik
