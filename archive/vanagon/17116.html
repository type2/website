Subject: RE: The Bus Stop


	Okay only because I'm too lazy to dig up the info on my own, will 
someone tell me where RMMW is located. I'm in Colorado and am under the 
imression they are also. And, can you show up in person to buy parts or 
are they strictly a mail order outlet? Then again the Rocky Mts. go from 
New Mexico to British Columbia so I could be way of....

-Rich/My other car is a Trek...but hopefully soon a '71 bus (please, god)
