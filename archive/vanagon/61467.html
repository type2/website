Subject: Should i sell?

I have a, up &quot;til last summer, reliable vanagon 1981. I have been
experiencing a problem, since the re-build, that is not going away. The
engine is running hot. Hotter than usual, anyway. The main fan does not seem
to be drawing in enough air to cool it sufficiently. There is nothing in the
fan itself. when this was discovered, I thought it may be improperly timed.
My mechanic says it is. But... He adjusted it advancing the timing until the
van reached some inkling of performance. Now heat may be destroying my van. I
still cannot beleive that my van cannot go above 60 mph. I need to go that
speed because of the idiots who drive in this state. I will and have been
driven off the road by the most inconsiderate drivers in all the world,
Arizona! Should I return to my mechanic and have the timing set to original
specs so my van barely crawls? I need help desperately. Thanks, and i'll try
and stay off the highway. I won't give up on my van.
