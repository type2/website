Subject: J. C. Whitney error

To All:

With five Volkswagens, I order a lot of maintenance parts from J.C.Whitney.
 Their gaskets, seals and bearings are the same brands carried by local
suppliers and are slightly less expensive even when the cost of shipping is
included.  But some days...

In anticipation of rebuilding a set of spindles for Grendel, I ordered two
sets of front wheel bearings, $5.48 for the inner, $4.95 for the outer.  Also
on the order was half a dozen front grease seals, half a dozen rear seal kits
and some miscellaneous items.  Total was about fifty bucks.  But when the
order arrived the bottom line was almost $150.  I nearly swallowed my pipe.

The $4.95 outer front wheel bearings were priced at $49.95 --  $99.90 for the
pair.

JCW's customer service lady had no explanation for the error but she was very
nice about setting things right.  Still...  kinda scary.  Given JCW's history
of bankrupcy and financial woes, and knowing a little error like this can
provide a nice boost to their cash flow, however temporary, I wonder if
anyone else has experienced a similar decimal shift?
