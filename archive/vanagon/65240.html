For those who recently have purchased Vanagons (or who may otherwise not
know):

Ever notice how hard it is to add oil to your van when the oil tube is
so low behind the license plate? Well, the oil tube has a tube inside it
that lifts up to facilitate adding oil. Those Germans are so clever. I
had been using an oil funnel for months.

I hope others can learn from my ignorance :)
