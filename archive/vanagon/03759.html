Subject: Re: 1970s heater boxes

I see heater boxes advertised all over for my '71 bus for about $100 each.
The dealer wants $300+ each. Anybody out there know for sure if there is a
quality difference, and if so, is it $200 each worth of difference? I don't
mind paying extra for the good stuff, but this is quite a price difference. I
have seen the $100 boxes, and they look pretty good. I believe they are
Brazilian. Are those from the dealer still German?
