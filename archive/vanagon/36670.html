&gt; The 115 speed can be explained by a couple of things...tail 
&gt; wind...speedometer error....driving down hill (look at a map...
&gt; England is higher on a map than France is, therefore to go to
&gt; France from England you are driving down), etc.

That would explain it all right...
 
&gt; It does sound feasable considering I've driven the 2.0L version
&gt; at 100....that's all that I said.

If I recall, you said 150km/hr, which is more like 93mph.  That would
mean the claimed top speed of the 2.5 was 22 mph faster than the 2.0.  I
still think it's a stretch.  :-)
