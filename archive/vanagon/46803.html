Subject: 	Inuvik departure party


Just to let you all know Christa and I will have a party at our place
Sunday night (July 21st), to send us off right.  Since we will be getting
an early start the next morning, things will kick off at 6:00 pm.  This
earlier time will also work for folks who have to work Monday AM.  I hope
all the trekkers that will be leaving Vancouver the next morning can get to
my place in time to take in the festivities.
