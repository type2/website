&gt; &gt; one story i heard was that you could take the old one to a ford dealer and
&gt; &gt; get a new one there pretty cheap ... but the $*%&amp;# ford dealer here wants
&gt; &gt; to know which year/model/color/dealer-you-bought-it-from about the car it
&gt; &gt; came from. it might be worth a try in your area.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought the Ford 3-wire for $65.  It is Bosch.  I will look up 
&gt; the part # at lunch today.
&gt; 

On the receipt:  0258-003-913  3-wire Oxy sensor $65.19

On the box were the numbers: 610328 021 13913.  13913 were also in big numbers
on the end of the box.  This oxy sensor is for Ford/Mercury cars, and does 
not have the correct plug, so you have to use the connector from your old 
sensor.
