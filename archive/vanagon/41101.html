&gt;Ideally, the heat exchangers are hung from the engine block by metal

Ahhhh... I wondered why my 78's heat exchangers seemed to be bolted
only to the exhaust pipes and nothing else!  I thought it a strange
engineering decision indeed.  What are my low-cost options (i.e. short
of replacing heat exchangers) to remedy this?  Is it good enough to
have a well-attached muffler bolted on the backside of the heat
exchangers?
