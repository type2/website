Subject: 88* Pre-ignition problems
Date: Mon, 19 Aug 1996 15:01:11 +-200

Hi,
I am a new subscriber to this list, so my apologies to the &quot;oldies&quot; if this is an old topic that has been fully discussed earlier.
What I've got:
1988, 2109cc, 82kW with Digijet injection
Engine was completely renovated 18 months ago.
My problem is:
Pre-ignition under load (pinking). 
I have checked all the settings and they are as specified in the manual that I have, i.e. CO Vol 2.0, Ignition Timing 10 deg BTDC.
Is there anyone out there who can come up with a solution?
