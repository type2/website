Subject: Is this your Synchro?
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 95 16:24:43 PST

 The white Synchro with the snazzy grill was spotted in the parking lot in
 front of the San Antonio Hobby Shop - a favorite store of my kids and 
 recipients of much of the family's discretionary spending- This Vanagon also
 had a very nice awning. If it's yours, I'm envious &lt;Thou shalt not covet thy
 neighbors Vanagon.....Ferdinand II:IV&gt;. 

 The red one definitly did not have the stock grill. It was way narrower. Has
 anyone else in BABA seen this Synchro?

 Dave
