With sufficient interest, I will mail order this stuff out to you anyone on 
the list, should AV Barke Supply be recalcitrant.  I have a wholesale 
account with these guys, benefits of my past life as a professional 
mechanic.....

&gt;I paid around $US 45 each for sychro ('90) rotors about a year ago.  My 
&gt;total (front axle) brake job cost about US$120; US$90 for 2 rotors, 

YES I knew I was being ripped off! $600Cdn + taxes. Many thanks, Tim S.
