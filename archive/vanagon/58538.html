Subject: 1986 Westfalia for sale

Just ran into someone locally with several VWs. They have one for sale, and
they don't have email access yet so I offered to post it for them:

1986 Vanagon Westfalia (camper, poptop, kitchen, etc)
104K miles, recently replaced heads and clutch
$9900 OBO
location: Bainbridge Island, WA
contact: 206-780-9432 or 206-780-1523

that's all I know right now. It was getting dark so I didn't take a close
look at it.
