Subject: Re: Tags on Eurovans? Mine does not fit!

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I just recieved my tag, from the dealer and the holes don't even come 
&gt;close to the mounting holes in the Eurovan.
&gt;
&gt;Has anybody else had this problem?  Do I have to buy or make a special 
&gt;bracket to hold my tag on?  Or should I just punch new holes in the tag 
&gt;to make it fit?
&gt;
&gt;Please help,
&gt;

Looking at the rear of my EV, I have a plastic license tag bracket thingy,
about the size of a license plate, attached by two screws to the sheetmetal
on the gate.  The two holes in the tailgate are 3&quot; below the license
light/door handle, and are spaced about 10-1/2&quot; apart.  If those match your
holes, you're missing the bracket! Go see the dealer or drill your plates.
Or, to keep from the plate scratching your paint, go to a parts store, buy a
license plate bracket and drill it to fit, then mount the plate on it.
