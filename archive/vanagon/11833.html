&gt;In the cars I've tinkered with, worn rings were common but
&gt;i've never seen something happen like this-boom then lots of
&gt;oil pouring in the combustion chamber.

i'd bet on a valve spring collapse or a broken rocker arm. any noise??
how bout loss of power (or were you not driving it)? something is letting
a lot of oil into the cylinder ... could also be a broken oil ring.

pull the plugs to see which cylinder it is. if it's two on the same side,
it might be a rocker arm assembly that's come loose after the rebuild.
good luck.
