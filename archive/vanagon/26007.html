Close, the cooler is to the left of the fan, but the fan on a '74 bus is 
mounted on the rear of the crank, as opposed to the generator on '71 and 
earlier.  As Thom said, the doghouse fan shroud started in '71, and ended 
since it's only for type I engines. 

OTOH, if the guy mistyped bus instead of bug, and misposted it to the 
Vanagon list, then yes, a '74 bug has a doghouse cooler.

BTW, glad to see bugnut stopped typing with double spaced words.
