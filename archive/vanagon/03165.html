&gt;Very nice job, Joel, but where are the pre '67 buses? How long were they?

sorry guys. :)  Ralf distracted me. ;)
1950-1955 Kastenwagen, Kombi, Bus, Krankenwagen,   4100 mm overall length
          Pritschenwagen                           161 inches, 13.5 feet
1956-1959 etc.                                     4190 mm overall length
                                                   165 inches, 13.7 feet
1960-1964 etc.                                     4280 mm overall length
                                                   168 inches, 14.0 feet
the Grossraum-Pritschenwagens were, again, longer (4300mm) and the later
single and double-cab pickup trucks were 10mm longer (4290mm). hmmmm. kinda
odd, that.

&gt;Hmmm. I always figured the 2-door and 4-door Rabbits were the same length.
&gt;Where did the length go? It certainly wasn't in the back seat legroom!

i always thought the extra length was in the pillar between the front and
rear door (it looked thicker than the same pillar in the 2-door).
