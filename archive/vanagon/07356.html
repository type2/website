&gt;I drove about 4 miles from work to that same darned bank machine, turned
&gt;the van off briefly, and it refused to start again.  It sits there now as
&gt;I wait for both of us to cool off.  Can anyone help?

this kinda smells like maybe the fuel filter problem that somebody else had
... where it was clogging up after a while. if you haven't changed the
fuel filter, it might not be a bad place to start.
