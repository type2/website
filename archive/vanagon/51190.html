Subject: Long life w/ low pressure in 1&amp;3?

Ok here's my saga-

My Westie, 83.5, waterboxer's compression is down to 75 psi in 1&amp;3 and 115 in
2&amp;4, I can handle the low power for a while, however I don't want to delay
too long in taking care of it, if it will save money in the long run.  

The compression was around 100 in 1&amp;3 about 16 months ago, but I am not sure
exactly what is going on to cause this drop.  I am losing a little
anti-freeze (a quart every couple months) but I think it is from sources
other than the heads, but I could be wrong. I am not sure what is the next
step.  People I've talked to in the past seem to think once you get into new
heads, you might as well go on to valves, engines and lots of $$$$

I could fork out the money but it would mean racking up the credit card again
and seeing as I work seasonly in the Tahoe Sierra's of CA (skiing and USFS)
paying the money is kind of hard to think about.  However, I do want to do
what it will take to keep my van going (and happy).  I would appreciate any
advice! 

Thanks, mike d
