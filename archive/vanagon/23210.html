Subject: re:valve seats

A question was asked about the Valve seats on certain engines.

The problem experienced is that the valve seats wear out, thus damaging your
heads, and valves. VW decided to use an insert as the valve seat, rather than
making it part of the case. Someone will probably dispute me on this, but I
am simplifying it to save space. What your options are, short of going to
a different engine(most people on this list can tell you what type of engine
has these seats, type II or IV I think) are getting new seats pressed in, if
your heads are not damaged, or going to ?(i can't for the life of me remember
who does this) and get one of their engines(again someone on this list knows),
what they have done is modify the valve seats so that there is a lip over
the top of it so that it does not get forced though the head.  VWT&amp;A or HVWs
did an article on these engines, towards the end of '94 or early '95, and
in their usual manner they mentioned the name of the company 5 million times.


Cheers,
