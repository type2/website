Subject: Re: What did I miss?????

The list isn't exactly in trouble.  I'm not sure of details, its been so
long ago since it was first mentioned, but a small contribution of 3-5, or
more if you can swing it is going to buying a server and software for the
list.  Who ever is running it, I believe Ron, is no longer in school, so the
server we use now will soon be unavailable.  As a response to this, listees
have been offering donations.  No one will profit except those of us who
feel this is the most valuable resource of info.  Hope this fills you in a
little, maybe someone else can give you exact details.
