Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]


I have to agree with Brian's observation that the list size is a powerful 
&quot;weapon&quot;....remember what happened during this past spring when a couple of 
our list members were having problems with certain &quot;suppliers&quot;...the word 
spread to those &quot;suppliers&quot; on how the information on the problems were 
being spread 'round the world to over 600 list members.

As I recall, the problems were solved pronto! 

To refresh your memories....one problem had to do with the warranty on a 
rebuilt engine...the other had to do with numerous complaints of 
&quot;inattention&quot; by another company...
