So Ric-ardo says:
&gt; Here's my $.02 on the &quot;list crossover&quot; discussion that has just 
&gt; started over here. There is NO need for crossover, IMHO. Each
&gt; group, r.a.vw, Vintag, and Vanagon have evolved because of the
&gt; unique &quot;community&quot; they serve.

Agreed....

&gt; 
&gt; R.A.VW about 2 years ago was the closest thing to a &quot;universal&quot;
&gt; VW list. Then the watercooled types wanted to split off and
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; caused such a stink about it that the aircooled types kind of
&gt; said &quot;up yours&quot; and ended up on Vintag.

Hmm.... The way I've read it is that the air-cooled types wanted
to split off to rec.autos.vw.air or some such.  And that the ma-
jority of water-cooleds didn't want to because they still felt they
had 'Roots' to the air-cooled cars.  Since the air-heads couldn't
get their own area, they regrouped on the vintage list.  I've held 
my tongue (held my fingers?) on this issue because my stupid server 
is slow and can be a day or two behind. :(  So I prefer the mailing 
lists anyway.  Can you say &quot;Instant Gratification&quot;?  Well almost.

&gt; All thats left on R.A.VW is a mix of 90% watercooled and 10%
&gt; air (as opposed to about a 50/50 mix 2 years ago). I still
&gt; read r.a.vw for the odd air-cooled piece and to see if there
&gt; is anything that would be relavant to my 200k mile 86 GTI.

Are we talking about coolant here?  ;-&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Its been said that the materials and discussions on Vintag as
&gt; well as Vanagon are probably better and more informative than
&gt; 10 years worth of DBHVW and VW T&amp;A...ooops Trends. I agree
&gt; with that. 

Hell, ten minutes of reading in either group is worth the entire
output of these worthless magazines put together.

&gt; 
&gt; I also see that there is a certain &quot;personality&quot; to each list (
&gt; maybe &quot;support-group mentality would be more like it  ;-)   )
&gt; that I think would dissapear by crossing the groups again..
&gt; can you imagine watercooled types putting up with:
&gt; 
&gt; 	1. Friday Haiku
&gt; 	2. My rantings about my EV and '56 bug
&gt; 	3. Steve Johnson being himself

Ahem... yeah .... well, I've seen how they put up with you!  How about
those Jaguar's eh?  ;)

&gt; 	4. Martha threatening to pose in a flannel shirt...

I know the entire list's male membership (and possibly some female) are
fantasizing about this one... :O
