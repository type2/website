Subject: Vibration



&gt;
&gt;Occasionaly, maybe one in twenty times, I get a vibration or shuddering when
&gt;releasing the clutch in first gear.  It seems to happen if there is some
&gt;stress involved such as heading up a hill from a stop.  All of the clutch
&gt;parts are new.  The CV joints are all new.  Could this be transmission or
&gt;motor mounts?  In my 63 beetle mounts were the problem.  What is involved in
&gt;changing vanagon mounts?
&gt;Thanks,  Lloyd Perkins  dad_at_together_dot_net
