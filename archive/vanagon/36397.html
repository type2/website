&gt; Now wait a minute. There are only 21 EV owners on this list, and we've only
&gt; heard complaining from two of them, and only one with a (potentially)
&gt; serious electrical problem (Tim). While that's about 10% of the given

That's right, you know.

&gt; Given the price differentials we're seeing lately from people shopping
&gt; around, it's clear where some VW dealers are making their extra profit
&gt; margins.

And, given my experiences to date with these guys, their extra profit
margin will disappear for at least one EV pretty dagnabbed soon!
