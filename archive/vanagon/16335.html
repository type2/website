&gt;I recently replaced my tank, as this corrosion had rusted the label almost
&gt;entirely off, and pitted the steel of the tank. 

&gt;the seams of the label with silicone sealant.  (there may be a better way to
&gt;do this, I'm not a paint and coatings guy)
&gt;


This label is the worst thing about these tanks. The label holds rusty metal
against the tank and holds moisture in there. If you seal the label agasint
the tank you lose cause condensation will thereby form and be sealed in
there, rusting away. If you don't seal the label, then you loose again cause
water and road salt go in there and rust everything away. 

I was able to knock one of my labels off but I can't get the other label to
come off yet. 

If you think you can remove your label, by all means DO IT. I used a chisel
and a sledge hammer and a lot of bending back and forth once it started to
come off.
