Subject: Re: question on J.C. Whitney Heater Box bypass
Date: Sun, 29 Jan 1995 22:24:29 -0600 (CST)

&gt;I am making a list of parts to buy from J.C. Whitney for my 77'.  Among them
&gt;are body panels and exhaust parts.  I am wondering if there is any real
&gt;disadvantage of getting the heater box bypass pipes for 10 bucks(as apposed
&gt;to 400 for heater boxes) and looking into alternative heat down the line?  I
&gt;know that I will enevitably have some kind of jury rig defrost because of
&gt;this action....If anyone could give me some insight or possibly tell me if I
&gt;am making a wrong decision, I would greatly appreciate it..

Don't know, Toby. What happened to your old heater boxes? Rusted away
because of road salt because you live in a cold part of the continent? 
Then you *will* need heat and I'm not sure there is a real alternative to
the heater boxes; at least not a cheap one. 

The little electric heaters that are advertized in some VW magazines were
criticized by this list for being whimpy, yet very draining on the battery.

You may want to look at Dave Garth's catalytic propane heater setup. Heard
lots of good things about it, although I don't know if it can be used
while driving. You may want to search the gopher files for more info. 

Also, you get what you pay for. The $200 JC Whitney's boxes are allegedly
not as efficient as the original ones. 

If you decide to get the bypass pipes anyway, look into oversized ones for
better flow and more power (as long as your new exhaust system is also
less constraining).
