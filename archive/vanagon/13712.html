&gt; I pretty much skimmed the earlier discussion about these new Eurovan 
&gt; conversions because I am really not terribly interested in a Westy type 
&gt; vehicle these days.  This weekend I attended an auto show, and saw the 
&gt; Winnebago Westy type conversion.  It looked very similar to what has come 
&gt; before and had a sticker price of about $30,000.
&gt; 
&gt; However, what surprised me is that there was another Winnebago Eurovan 
&gt; conversion at the show as well.  This was a much larger vehicle that was 
&gt; truly a small motorhome, including a 110V generator etc..  Somehow, I can't 
&gt; imagine the 2.5 liter engine even making this thing move, since other 
&gt; vehicles of this size have hefty V8's.  And, it only came in an automatic!
&gt; 
&gt; The big one had a sticker price of $46,000 and was on sale for $42,000.  Has 
&gt; any of you folks seen or driven the behemoth?

Yup.  Stopped and looked at it the other day.  Picked up a nice color
brochure on it too, so if y'all have any questions about it just ask.
They had two of them on the lot, both were about $42k, I think.  The
worst thing about it was that I couldn't stand upright inside it, and I
am only 6'0&quot;.  Don't even consider this camper unless you are 5'9 or under.
Also, the sewage pipes hung way down on the outside, only about 4&quot; off
of the ground.  Don't even consider taking this beast off of the pavement.
Other than that, it was real nice.  Had a really trick popout bathroom
inside.  That alone was worth stopping to see.
