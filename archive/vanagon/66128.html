Yes, However I want to run it off of the output of the Subaru ECU.  The
ignition system is a breakerless system.  It has an igniter, an ignition
coil (actually two in one), and the ECU.  So I guess I need to know the
output of pin 1 of the VW coil and where I can get that signal from the
breakerless system.

So where did you mount the aftermarket Tach?
