Subject: &quot;Archive&quot; Hell

For the confused (of whom I am sometimes one) -

The term &quot;archive&quot; seems to be tossed around fastly and loosely within 
our vanagon_at_lenti context. Check to see if I've got this straight:

When I read Skip's web page version of the list (you don't have all this 
correspondence cluttering up your in-box, do you? ;-) at the URL:

http:/www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list

there is always a link at the top of the page labeled &quot;Other mail 
archives&quot; which simply points to the HTML page that contains the 
previous few hundred mail messages.  Each of those has a &quot;Other mail 
archives&quot; link which points to *its* previous page, and so on ad 
infinitum, or ad filesystem, as it were.

So that's ONE kind of &quot;archives.&quot;  Then there's the way-cool searchable 
gopher archives that Gerry maintains at:

gopher://halfdan/med/umn/edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

These are *all* the mail messages since the list started (right? I'm a 
relative newbie...) These are organized in, I guess, chronological 
order, but I never browse them that way: I use the gopher search engine 
to locate &quot;keywords of interest&quot; (ie, &quot;Syncro&quot;!) so I don't have to slog 
through thousands of FFFFriday funnies, for instance.  These archives 
have often saved me from re-posting the same tiresome questions that 
have already been answered numerous times (ahem.) In addition, under 
Gerry's gopher site there's also:

gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon/Files

which *I* think of as an archive of all kinds of great resources: model 
summaries, test drive reports, how-to articles, technical bulletins, and 
horror stories.  I sometimes (erroneously) refer this collection to 
people as the Vanagon list &quot;FAQ&quot;, but Skip has another FAQ page at:

http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/faq.html

He also has a Technical Tips page which is a collection of links back 
into the halfdan gopher site &quot;Files&quot;. Of course there's plenty of other 
Volkswagenabilia that continues to sprout all over the web, including 
yet another VW &quot;archive&quot; at:

http://www.oden.se/~fh/TVWA.HTML

So if you *really* want to do the thorough research on your own before 
asking a YAFAQ (Yet Another Frequently Asked Question), there are plenty 
of places to look.  Or, heck, just post it to the list anyway - we're 
friendly!
