Depends on the installer on how the wires were routed.
On one of my busses the PO snaked them around the edges of the 
camper floor/carpet.
Check continuity for each wire front to back (label).
Check for grounding to body each wire (shouldn't be grounded).
I had one wire that was shorted to ground by a screw removed to route 
wires and re-installed through a wire.

&gt; routed to the front and if they stay the same
&gt; color all the way to the front?

&gt; Thanks
