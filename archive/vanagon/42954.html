Subject: O2 sensor part number and ?'s
Date: Sat, 25 May 1996 19:01:10 -0400 (EDT)

Hello all
	I have searched the archive and was unabel to find a
reference for the part number for the O2 sensor.  I have an 86'
GL.  The number on the part i pulled out is 0 258 001 051.
I wanted to verify that this is the correct sensor.  It has one
long black wire coming out of it that that connects to a green
wire that disappears into a casing that i assume eventually
leads back into the brain (no bentley, no assurance).  I guess
this is the one wire variety.  
	I am troubled, though, by the fact that i found a stray
connection with a rubber cased fitting coming out of all the
lumped up cables, wires, etc on the left side of the engine
box.  What could this be to???  Is this part of the three wire
O2 sensor ???  
any help is much appreciated.
