&gt;Back in 1990, Hot VW's did a series of articles on the restoration of an
&gt;early ('71, I think) Westfalia, that covered everything from engine mods
&gt;to replacing the canvas top.  I have a couple of articles (canvas top
&gt;replacement and torsion bar adjustment), but sure would like the whole
&gt;series.  Does anybody have the whole series by any chance, or know which
&gt;issues these ran in (and how many there were)?

:) i have all but about two ... i think i'm missing the engine and trans
articles. i'll check tonight, but i think there were seven (7) parts. i'll
put the list of what i have on the list tonight. i'd like to get copies of
the ones i'm missing, and am willing to swap the ones i have.
