Subject: rec.autos.vw re-organization


Usenet news readers -

This is just a reminder, the vote for the rec.autos.vw re-organization
is underway, in fact it's in its final week.  If you haven't voted,
and read rec.autos.vw or plan to, you should vote!

If you have any questions or want a copy of the CFV (call-for-votes),
please send me mail (don't respond to this list, I don't want to cause
traffic here).
