Subject:       oil cooler o-ring

Here's one from the for-what-its-worth department.

I just had the oil cooler o-ring replaced on this '87 I bought.
It was leaking on cold starts so I had the dealer in Bemidji do it
while doing some cooling system work. They took out the original,
black-not-grey o ring. 

The previous owner has been fighting
cold-start oil leaks for several years and even switched to
synthetic to reduce the problem.  Now get this-- he has told the VW
dealer in his town about this and has the dealer change oil for him,
even brings his synthetic oil to the dealer!  They never changed the #$%#ing
o-ring AND the nut holding the cooler on was loose... after about 170 
miles since they (the dealer) just changed oil!!!  

Moral:  If something stinks, don't keep eating it.

BTW, the o-ring cost $2.60
