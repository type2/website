Y'all mention that 6000RPM might be a little scary.  Only for a wasserboxer.
The carrera II will sing merrily at 6000 all day.  MSDS has the range panzer
kit which trades your ultra reliable water heat for no heater at all but 
230+bhp.  He'll do the conversion for you for ~$10,000US includes the motor.
or ~$4,000 you supply the motor.  Or the kit of parts ~1,500 and you do the 
work, buy the extra porsche parts and rx7 parts and of course supply a pukka
carrera II motor.

You run larger tires on 15&quot; wheels to gear up for the 117mph top speed.

The claim is it'll out climb (syncro of course) any box stock UJMT or stock
US 4wd bronco, k5, powerwagon, etc.

But no heat.

The reliability of the carrera II is very good, much better than the poor 
overstressed 2.0l waterslosher.

But no heat.

A bit on antennas for 27mhz.  A loop won't do it for a transmitting antenna
a half wave dipole might but then it's 16 feet linear measure.  Best compro
mise is a 5/8wave whip mounted in the center of the luggage bin grounded
to the car metal.  The radiation pattern is the issue.  A whip radiates 
equally around 360 degrees perpendicular to its axis PROVIDED it's not 
affected by ground plane parts like car tops.  The coupling effects will
distort the pattern.

For non westies mount a K5 magnetic mount 5/8 wave in the center of the metal
top.  Damn fine pattern and 1:1.05 SWR.  The gutter mount top loader I use
has a moderately poor radiation pattern, 1:1.5 SWR but it folds down and doesn't
need holes in the sheet metal.

You pays you money you takes you choice.

A bit on Bodacious Bay.  Howabout we stop off on the way up at Johnsons Oyster
Ranch and sack up some for bbq oysters.
