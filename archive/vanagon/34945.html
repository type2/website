Subject: RE: 'roo bars?


&gt;Anyone have any data, pictures, or whatever of large-animal-impact
&gt;resistance add-ons for a microbus?  I'm thinking that something like
&gt;that would go well with the safari windows on the Wombat ('58), as
&gt;well as playing with the minds of other motorists in the area.

An 1860's Union Pacific 3-3-0 cowcatcher will do the trick nicely, is
aptly named, and will improve your fore-and-aft weight distribution
into the bargain.

And you thought those bugs with the fake Ford front hoods looked funny...


&gt;Yes, it's Friday, and yes, this is silly, but I am actually moderately
&gt;serious about it.

I'm not.   :^)
