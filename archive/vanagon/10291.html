So Joel Walker says:
&gt;      Total       253
&gt; you will, of course, notice that californiators have not quaked into
&gt; no less than THREE (3, III) categories: the CA.BA is now those citizens
&gt; living in the Bay Area. now, i've included those folks living in those
&gt; areas CLOSE to the san francisco bay area ... fresno and sacramento are
&gt; NOT close (to me). but if you wanna be, lemme know. :)

There's no way that Sacto. could be even remotely construed is being part
of the bay area unless ya look at it from a commuters point of view.  And
even then, I think you would be hard pressed.  Besides, I think the bay area 
people would be insulted and the Sacto. area people would be embarrassed.  ;)

ACKKK!  We lost a '91.  What the Hell?  Life just isn't fair.  :(    ;)
