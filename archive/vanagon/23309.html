Subject: Re: Bob's Career Moves On!

I agree, look at what happened to G. Gordon Liddy! I could see guest spots
on the Click and Clack, Larry King, and the Letterman shows. As his career
blossomed we would soon see Bob in the Enquirer hanging at the Oscar Awards
with Pamela Sue Anderson, partying with Bobby Brown, Ice T, and Eddie
Murphy, but romantically linked to Jackie Onassis' ghost and alien babies
with two heads. ROTFLetc... ;)

&gt;I'm all for it. (re: the Bob Hoover/World Tour) Maybe Bob could give talks
at local VW club meetings as he's passin' thru.  Could be a new career. ;-)
