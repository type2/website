&gt; I am still suprised that these coupling are not offered as replacements for

three of these

&gt;  Anybody?

I'm not sure exactky how you'd propose to do this.  One VC for each half-axle
to maintain the axle speed proportional to the driveshaft speed?  This would
put a constant &amp; heavy load on the VC, a condition I'm not certain it's well
suited for.  With this layout, the VCs would &quot;unlock&quot; while coasting in a
straing line and then allow the driveshaft to spin untill they locked up when
the driver re-applied power.  Also, they'd both tend to lock while turning a
corner on pavement - an undesireable situation.

I must have misunderstood what you're suggestion.  Care to explain a bit
further?
