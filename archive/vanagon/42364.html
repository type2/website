Subject: Re: Where's the gas heater go?

Having recently gotten an Eberspacher BN-4 gas heater (thanks Jeff
Schneiter), I am now trying to find out the original installation location
and details for Opie, my '68 Crew Cab pickup.  I think they went under the
rear seat on the drivers side.  Has anyone ever seen one installed?  Any
ideas on where I might find documents or manuals showing this installation?
 - - - -

they go in the engine compartment on the auxiiary battery tray in the buses,
i'm not sure about the truck.    I saw a stewart warner in the under bed
luggage compartment.
