&lt;&lt; s this reverse grind normal? Or has anyone else suffered this problem and
 has an idea what to blame it on?

 I have a newly rebuilt engine so I didn't replace the pilot bearing when I
 did the trans replacement. I assumed it was Ok. And I was also pretty broke
 so I didn't replace the clutch or pressure plate. But like I said the
forward
 gears work fine.

 Finally, I didn't adjust the clutch. But if it were a clutch adjustment
 problem, wouldn't it grind into forward gears as well? &gt;&gt;


J.R.

adjust your clutch, and kiss this grind goo-bahee.
