Subject: Porsche 914 chassis alignment

My brother has a '74 Porsch 914 that has been fighting rust for a while.  A
while back, he jacked up the middle of the car and welded in some new metal
under the chassis to keep the car from sagging, (it was pretty rusty) and he
wants to know if there is any source of manuals that give the factory
specifications for chassis measurments and alignments.  He would like to
straighten everything out so that his doors might someday shut good again.
If you have any ideas of where to look, please let me know.  Also, if you
know someone that might know, go ahead and forward this message to them.  Thanks
