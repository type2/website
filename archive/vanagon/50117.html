Subject: Re: 87 westy

Had a similar problem on my 82. The light would glow. I replaced the
regulator and it went another year before I had to replace the alternator.
If you have a Bosch alternator the regulator is mounted on the back, remove
it and look at the brushes. The bosch alternators like to wear down the
brushes. You may find one kind of long and the other rather short. You
could just replace the brushes if you can find them. I used to always
replace the regulator HTH

&gt;howdy all....
&gt;          ive got an 87 westy...drives great!  my question to anyone who
&gt;recognizes the symptoms...is, my alternater light is on now for at least 20
&gt;minutes before it finally goes out.....when it does go out,all is fine(camper
&gt;battery lights indicate correct voltage, green light).  does this sound like
&gt;my alternater is going?   or perhaps my voltage regulator?   because it
&gt;eventually kicks in...i keep going with the hope that it will correct
&gt;itself...;)   am i wasting time hoping its all right , when im clearly
&gt;experiencing a failing alternater?  if i need  to replace the
&gt;alternator..should i go with new? or remanufactured?  Im still trying things
&gt;to remedy my sliding door which opens a notch while im driving along....;( .
&gt; any experience with this problem would be much apprecciated.
