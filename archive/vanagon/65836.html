&gt; I found out today that Gerber lost a lawsuit because they advertised that
&gt; their food was all natural and when taken to court it came out that they
&gt; had used preservatives.
&gt;
&gt; In the settlement Gerber Food is now responsible for giving every child
&gt; born between 1985 and 1997 (under the age of 12) a $500 Savings Bond.
&gt;
&gt; All you have to do to receive it is to send a copy of your child's birth
&gt; certificate and social security card to:
&gt;
&gt; GERBER FOOD
&gt; Settlement Administration
&gt; Infant Litigation
&gt; P.O. Box 1602
&gt; Minneapolis, MN 55480
&gt;
&gt; Naturally, all of you will allow your child, when they reach the age of 16,
&gt; to use this Bond to purchase a VW and not waste it on something unimportant
&gt; like college.  :-)
