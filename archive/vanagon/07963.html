Subject: starter motor switch (didn't work)

Problem:

I have been having problems with the starter system on my '78. It fails 
to run the motor, but if I short the solenoid, the motor will work for a 
while, but any long high speed runs will cause the system to return to 
non-functioning status.  Fortunately, I live in an area with plenty of 
hills.  

Possible Solution: 

Last time I mentioned this problem someone mentioned that there might be
an out of round bushing in the bell housing.  One of the solutions
proposed on net was to replace the motor with an one of the automatic
transmission versions, which are self supporting.  A friend of my 
father's turned out to have a working ATR starter motor among his spares, 
so I tried this.

Result:

Don't do it.  The gear on the ATR starter motor does not extend as far as 
the the manual trans version. and does not engage the flywheel. Oh, well, 
back to the hill.
