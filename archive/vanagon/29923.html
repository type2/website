&gt;Well, after 9 weeks at my local vw mechanic my '79 Cal bus is going to be
&gt;fixed. The mechanic says they're giving up on the brain-fix and are going to
&gt;remove all the computer-ignition stuff and install a center-mount Weber
&gt;carb. It is claimed this will get me more power and be easier to repair in
&gt;the future.  The cost of a new &quot;black box&quot; and injectors (which I guess were
&gt;also bad) would have been in the $900 range, the carb will be around $500 or so.
&gt;
&gt;This was one of the options I suggested to them way back, but was poo-pooed
&gt;as impractical -- &quot;you don't want to remove that fuel injection system!&quot; --
&gt;etc.   Since I'm not in Cal, the tyrannical emissions regulations are not a
&gt;problem.  Question: has anyone else gone this route with a bus? What are the
&gt;advantages/disadvantages?
I did this on a '78 bus for the reasons you cited above (difference in cost
and easier to troubleshoot and fix).  I went with the progressive Weber you
describe.  It cost &lt;$300 and was pretty easy to install, taking less than an
afternoon.  After I got the FI stuff out of there, I could actually see the
engine! :-)  It ran a lot better than it did before, and I would recommend
the swap.  Think of it this way:  If you have fuel delivery problems in the
future, it pretty much HAS to be the carb or the small electric fuel pump
you'll probably be using.  With the AFC system, you've got almost a dozen
items that can fail, a couple of which are going to be as much or more than
your carb cost.  Even if you fix the problem now, you might have another
expensive FI problem in a month or so.  IMHO, don't get rid of a FI system
just for the heck of it, but if you're facing major expenses it just makes
more sense to go with a carb.  It worked just fine for me.
