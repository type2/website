Subject: Re: '77 Bus (with 78 Engine) Clutch pedal doesn't return

Patrick Walters writes:
&gt;I backed out of the driveway, shifted in to first, shifted into second 
&gt;and then when I went for third the clutch pedal didn't return all the 
&gt;way. 
&gt;
&gt;I checked the clutch cable and besides me putting a kink in it while 
&gt;checking it there was nothing wrong with it (except now I have to 
&gt;replace it because I kinked it). I adjusted the wing nut and took all 
&gt;the slack out of the cable and the pedal still had several inches of 
&gt;slop in it. 
&gt;
&gt;I called my mechanic about an alleged spring on the pedal return, and 
&gt;there isn't one on a 77. I do have the spring on the arm the clutch 
&gt;cable pulls (on the clutch itself).
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any ideas on this one?

Maybe something is messed up inside the bellhousing?  Eg. the piece that
moves the throwout bearing could be broken, or the bearing could have
slipped off it.
