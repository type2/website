Subject: couple of q's


1. my tailpipe split between the part where it forks and the catalytic
converter. What is that part, it's the small piece that has the O2 sensor
on it.

2. will i cause permanent damage driving without that piece? (it broke off
completely)

3. What could cause this: after I warm up and have been driving, the
engine revs to 1200 and then drops back off to 1000, then back to 1200,
then back to 1000. It does this non-stop at idle speed but runs fine at a
drive.
 Any help would be great, THANKS!!!! Jarrett
