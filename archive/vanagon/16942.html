Subject: Bay Area waste oil disposal
Date: Fri, 5 May 95 11:49:15 PDT

  The Palo Alto recycling center, which anybody can use, recycles waste oil, waste
  coolant and spent car batteries in addition to all the routine recycling stuff.

  From Hwy. 101, take Embarcadero Road East &lt;towards the bay&gt; all the way until
  it ends. Turn right, the recycling center is on the right several
  hundred yards up.

  Dave
