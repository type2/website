&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Todays stupid question is: Can I put a rear door (hatch?) from a bay
&gt; window on a  67 split window? Mine is dented and the local junkyard  has
&gt; a couple bay windows... The glass looks to be the same size... Anybody
&gt; know?
&gt; 
I believe thet you can use a rear hatch from up to a 75. I think 64-75
are the same. I would try to get as early a model as possible, though.
Richard
