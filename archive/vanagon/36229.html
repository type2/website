Subject: New Baywindow spotted

All,

On the way to work today I spotted a nice grey/blue baywindow Westy
waiting in a line of traffic, as I passed by I noticed there was a grill
on the front, and the top wasn't a poptop, but a weekender type, non
poptop. Looked real nice.  I wasn't too sure of how these would look
with the radiators on the front, but VWoMex has done a real nice looking
job with it.

Also, I saw a new Honda today with the new Texas plates, the numbering
series starts with VVW ***.
                   ^^^

I need some new plates.
