&gt;I recently took my fridge (84 Westy) out to service it and on replacing
&gt;it one of the gas line nuts cracked (good job it cracked then rather than
&gt;on the hi-way!). If anyone on the list has a broken dometic fridge and could
&gt;donate/sell a part then please e-mail me.  The part I need is the copper
pipe
&gt;
&gt;(plus nuts)that lies allong the top of the fridge and connects with the pipe
&gt;to 
&gt;the tank at one end and at the other end connects to the on/off valve.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;David       

The copper fittings are standars US Flare type fittings.  Available at local
harsware or propane supplier.
