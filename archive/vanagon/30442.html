Subject: re:Camping in sleepers (or is it...)


&gt;Crap! I thought this thread was going to be about taking an overnight
&gt;train.

&gt;Ric

A train leaves Los Angeles as 5:00pm PST on mon, and another train leaves New
York at 5:00pm EST on mon, at what time do we pitch a tent in the sleeper?
or is it the camper? or is it the camper in the sleeper? or could it be the
sleeper in the camper?


Oh damn, now I've confused myself :-)


I guess you all are wondering what the answer to the $64,000 question (&quot;yeah
right David, we all really care how you camp in your sleepers. Or was it
sleep in you camper?)

Down - head to the rear

Up - head to the front.

Cheers,

David
