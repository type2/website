&gt; I was at FRY's yesterday and when wandering around I remembered the statement
&gt; in the Inuvik group that a CB radio was a good thing to have when travelling
&gt; as a 'convoy' tho I have yet to see a westie with 18 wheels!!  

Ah Fry's....the toy store for us geeks...  :)  Sam, don't worry about
having anybody to speak to on your newly acquired 'toy'.  Most of us
who are going already have ours.  Before long, as with the Internet, 
you'll wonder how you ever got by before!  ;)
