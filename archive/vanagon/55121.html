My wiper has exactly the same problem. It first failed to park properly
after I tried to use it while it was frozen to the glass. There is no
apparent mechanical problem such as stripped shaft or such. The problem
seams to be purely electrical. I have noticed that after turning it on
and off several times it begins to park correctly more often. My
suspicion is that an electrical contact has been burned and is not
making a reliable contact. Some more insight would help before I
eviscerate the little b*g**r.
