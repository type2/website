Subject: Brake fluids and Stainless steel Brake Lines

I have always thought about replacing the metal lines with better metal, but
they have never been my problem, unless of course the rubber lines are clogging
with rust from the metal lines.  My metal lines have always been free-flowing,
but living in an area that got 70 inches of rain last year, it does make sense
that when I start improving my bus, as opposed to keeping it on the road,
stainless steel lines might be a way to go.

BTW, when buying brake fluid for purging out /  bleeding my brake system, I
noticed something that, if I remember correctly, was touted as DOT 5, synthetic
brake fluid.  The claim was that this stuff doesn't absorb water, had a higher
flash point (not a real concern in my low performance brake system), and didn't
break down as readily as either DOT 3 or 4.  Are there any recommendations /
experince out there regarding synthetic brake fluid, its compatibility with the
system on my '64 Camper, and reasons to use or not use DOT 4 or 5 over DOT 3 in
my system.

Thanks,
--terry ('64 Camper being re-born)

----------------------------------------------------------------Regarding
clogged brake lines, you may wish to consider installing stainless steel lines
and using silicone-based fluid.  The alcohol contained in regular (DOT3) brake
fluid absorbs moisture, hence the need to replace it every few years.  Failure
to do so eventually produces rusty brake lines.  The silcone stuff contains no
alcohol; it has no periodic replacement requirement.  And of course, the
stainless steel lines don't rust.
