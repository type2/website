Subject: type IV still misses

I posted an article about my '77 fuel injected 2.0 liter, and how it misses
sometimes.  It will drive fine and then, at some rpm and load it will miss
severely and the car jerks around.  Could this be a problem with my EGR
valve.  As far as I know the valve works fine, but I do not have the filter
hooked up to the exhaust pipe.  The filter was so rusted that I just took it
off when I put this engine in the car.
