&gt;&gt;only thing I can think of is to smear some RTV sealant on the
&gt;&gt;gaskets, but that makes a huge mess.  Still, that's what I'm gonna hafta
&gt;&gt;do if someone doesn't tell me what the heck I am overlooking...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance,

&gt;          I know this sounds simple, but have you thought of doubling up
&gt;on the gasket.  It sounds like you aren't getting enough preasure between
&gt;the two parts to make a good seal.  The red RTV sealant MAY work, but 
&gt;chances are it will burn off sooner than later.

What I used is Permatex Ultra Copper Hi-Temp RTV Silicone Gasket, Guaranteed
Not to Leak.  Part No. 101-B, Item No. 81878.  I put this between the intakes
and the heads on my recently rebuilt (by me) 1700cc in the '72 Westy and
haven't had any trouble yet!  Of course I haven't started it since I did that
either!  But the stuff said it has a &quot;special additive&quot; for temps up to 650
degrees faren. and 343 degrees cels.

P.S.
Now I'll wait to see how long it takes for me to see this.  My &quot;AOL and the
list&quot; came back real quick but my posting about busses for sale has not yet.
