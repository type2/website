&gt;Hi, I'm looking for a chrome rear bumper for my '78 Westy. Any tips and
&gt;leads appreciated.  If you have one, I will share some of my insurance
&gt;windfall with you (if it ever arrives!).  I was rear ended and was blown
&gt;away to find out that the chrome bumpers are a limited edition deal for
&gt;'78s only (is this really true?), making them out of sight new and not
&gt;available (apparently?) after-market.

check with these folks for a regular bumper, then check round Seattle (or
somewhere closer) for a Chrome-plating shop. most any good condition bumper
can be plated, either with chrome or, if you choose, colors (via powder
blasting ... the electric-charged heat-baked painting).
