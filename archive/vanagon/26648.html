Subject: Other famous van drivers...


Speaking of famous VW Van drivers, I was channel surfing last night
and saw an early breadloaf on, of all things, ESPN2....naturally I
stopped surfing for a moment. The program was about Fred Dryer...
the guy who played Hunter, and aparently (there goes my lack of
football knowlege...) played pro football in the 70s. He was being
interviewed in his panel van, complete with a bed and paneling
while driving cross country. The clip lasted about 5 minutes.
