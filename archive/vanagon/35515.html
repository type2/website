Subject:  HELP--speedometer 

Hey all

OK, I went down to see if I could find the cause behind my speedometer
not working.  By the way, this is a '78 bus.  Anyway, got the cable
unscrewed from the back of the speedometer.  I then turned the thing
that the cable plugs into with my fingers and the speedometer needle
moved and registered a speed, so I guess that means the speedometer
itself is OK and that the problem is in the cable.  OK, so I have the cable
end hanging out from under the dash so I can see it.  I then jack up the
left front wheel and spin it.  The cable does not spin.  So, there's
something goofy with the cable.  I don't know how to take the thing out.  I
tried to get the grease cap off the front wheel but I couldn't get it to
budge.  Does anyone have any tricks for getting this thing off?  And don't
say heat cause I ain't got it.  Also, what could be the problem?  Is the
cable likely to be broken??  If it was broken, shouldn't I have been able to
get it out by pulling on the dash end (I tried but it didn't want to come out).
 Someone please help 'cause I've never done anything with the speedo
cable before and I'd like to get it fixed this weekend if possible.  

If I want to remove the cable, do I pull it out from the wheel hub or from
under the dash?  

Any help is greatly appreciated,

Thanks,
Sean
