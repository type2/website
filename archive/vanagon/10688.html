&gt; &gt;HOW many cars will allow you to survive a 65mph head-on into cement?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It doesn't seem to make sense but IMHO a bus is engineered.
&gt; 
&gt; That's pretty damned lucky.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine took his crew-cab ('6x vintage) head-on into a semi on a
&gt; two-lane highway (probably fell asleep).  After three days they unplugged
&gt; him...
&gt; 
&gt; So, somewhere between 65 and combined 130 is the theoretical limit...
&gt;
