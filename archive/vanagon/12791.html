&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Howdy,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;	Concerning the 12V fridge in my 6V '56 kombi...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;	David S had suggested runnign it on 6V.  Does that seem wise to
&gt;&gt;y'all?  DO ya think it would even work?  I'm curious, and would like
&gt;&gt;some feedback before I start running amuck with wires and stuff.
&gt;&gt;

Running fredge with battery, 6 or 12V, is not a real good idea to me. 
Even with deep cycle batteries they are not going to last too long. Deep
cycle batteries need to be recharged real soon after they are discharged.
No harm other than normal wear will happen only if they get recharged
real soon. If you put discharged batteries (deep cycle or not) aside for
some time the lead plates begin to crystalize and very quickly lose capacity. 

Unless you don't care about the cost of consuming expensive batteries you should
buy or build a 6V to 12V converter. I don't know where you can buy one but 
building one yourself is not impossible.

Do you know how much current (or the wattage) the fridge eats under 12V? The 
switching power transistors need to switch at twice of that amont since they
are switching at 6V.
