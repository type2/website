When I Was Young And Pretty
   by W. H. Awfuldin and his dog, Spot.


When I was young and pretty,
  I heard a Wise Man say:
&quot;Give Marks and Pounds and Dollars,
  &quot;But not your Bus away.&quot;
But I was young and pretty,
  No use to talk to me;
A Bus was just another car,
  And traded frequently.

When I was young and pretty,
  I thought I knew it all;
I had been driving, don't you see,
  For years in Traffic's crawl.
I'd had my education,
  As much as I could stand;
Why, I knew all there was to know,
  As much as Any Man!

I'd had so many autos,
  I can't remember them;
I'd bought, and sold, and bought again,
  With Credit, Cash, and Whim.
Sedans, Two-doors, Convertibles,
  I'd several Buses, too ...
And when I tired of what I had
  I'd go get something new.

But now I'm older, sadder,
  No longer Wise Men speak;
And if they did, I couldn't hear
  Unless they really shriek,
And Buses that I once enjoyed
  Are memories in the past;
If only I'd hung onto them ...
  I understand, at last.

When I was young and pretty,
  I heard a Wise Man say:
&quot;Give Marks and Pounds and Dollars,
  &quot;But not your Bus away.&quot;
Since now I'm old and ugly,
  I pass this on to you:
Remember what those Wise men say,
  It's true, it's true, it's true.
