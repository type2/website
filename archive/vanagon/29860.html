Subject: the significance of the heat riser tube

From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


I've just gone through a merry-go-round of farces trying to get a new
muffler for the Gerbil.  The first one had the flange that bolts up to
the right exhaust port welded on at the wrong angle.  The second
was apparently stolen between when UPS delivered it to the receiving
area at my work and when the receiving person got around to going
through all the boxes (i.e., UPS has a valid signature, but there's no
record of it coming into the building).  The third has the flange on
the right side heat riser tube welded on at the wrong angle.

At this point, I'm pretty frustrated, to put it mildly.  What are the
consequences of using muffler #3?  The heat riser flanges mate on one
side, and have a millimeter or two of gap on the other (yes, I
remembered to put the gasket in).  I would expect one of the following
to happen:

- Some quantity of unheated fresh air is sucked in through the gap,
  with results similar to a vacuum leak.
- Some quantity of heated exhaust gas escapes through the gap, with
  accompanying noise.

The question is, which one happens, or is there a third possibility I
haven't even counted upon?

Lesson of the day:  Before attempting to install new components, run a
bolt into each of the new holes you plan on filling, and a nut on each
of the new studs.  If the manufacturer of your new part painted the
thing after tapping the holes and inserting the studs, but neglected
to protect those parts from the paint/primer, doing this will save you
a bunch of grief.  Using the appropriately-sized tap and die would be
even better, if you happen to have them.
