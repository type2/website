Subject: Syncro Clutch Remove Trans Not Motor

I notice that in the amendments to the 156 page &quot;V.A.G. Workshop Manual
Volkswagen Transporter; Four-wheel drive 5-speed manual gearbox 094 and
final drive&quot; it says that when changing the clutch on Syncro vehicles the
regular manual is wrong--that you should change the clutch by taking the
engine out not the transmission. They seem to think it is less work to
remove the motor than to remove the transmission. 

&quot;When working on the clutch, the engine should be removed *not the gearbox*
as indicated in the Workshop Manual. This reduces the work to be performed
on syncro vehicles.&quot;
