well ther is a VW show in Kitchener-Waterloo in late June or early July.
There is also a show In Sparta, Ontario (near London) every summer too. VW
T&amp;A even mentions the dates of these shows in their coming events section.

&gt;&gt;&gt;      Specifically does anyone know of upcoming VW events, &quot;Bug-In&quot;'s
&gt;&gt;&gt;etc in the south-central Ontario area.  What about upper New Yrok State?

&gt;&gt;Hey, there's an annual bug fest of some sort in Kingston each year, usually
&gt;&gt;at Lake Ontario Park, right next to KPH (the loonie bin, figures) Been to
&gt;&gt;one when I lived there. Look for adverts on telephone polls, it's a high end
&gt;&gt;event by gum!   tim s.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As soon as you find out about the fest, let me know friend!
