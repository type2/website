Subject: Re: BA 6 AUX FAN

One other slightly unrelated note. The BA6 will also run on diesel fuel - so
says the manual. Meaning that they were also installed in diesel versions of
the westy as well as the air-cooled and CDN water-cooled versions. That
might be a good place to look for parts as well.

&gt;Hi,  Yes, I have a Bentley, and have a complete BA6 off a '81 Van. 
&gt;
&gt;What do I do about the large inlet of the gas heater (previously where the
&gt;semi-heated air from the heater boxes entered the gas heater), since I now have
&gt;no heater boxes, or center heater tube?
&gt;
&gt;where do I run the hot air that comes out of the gas heater since the dash
&gt;blower motor doesn't have an opening for the center heater tube? I looked
behind
&gt;that console panel, and the hole in the sheetmetal that would have been for the
&gt;center heater tube, if my van had been aircooled, now has coolant lines running
&gt;thru it. 
&gt;
&gt;any ideas?
&gt;
