Subject: Re: eurovan recall


Only wusses would have the bolt fixed...me I'm gonna take my chances...
roll the dice...yep, the chicks dig that sorta stuff...gonna get
me a t-shirt, roll up a pack of butts in the sleeve, drive around
all day get me  a trucker tan....slick back my hair!  :-)

Actually I got the notice from VW back in June...about two days
later got a cupon from VW for a free oil change....

on a serious note I did get the EV done MONTHS ago...it too bad
that everytime Joel has nuthin else better to do he re-posts..
and re-posts the EV recall notice!!!   :-)
