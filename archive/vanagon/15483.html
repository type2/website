Subject: Nice Bus, the book, update #1

Sorry about the porblems a few of you have had filling out the survey on 
line. It works fine from here, but I am local with the server. I will try 
to figure out what is going on. In the meantime, I am happy to snail mail 
surveys to anyone, or, depending on your web browser, you can print the 
survey by clicking on the link below the on-line survey link (&quot;And, click 
here to see the Nice Bus survey as it would appear if you found it on 
your windshield.&quot;) This should print pretty much the way one I would send 
you looks. 

Thanks to all those who tried so far and to the tidbits that were posted 
on the list. Buses seem to be quite popular in movies, and they often get 
destroyed. I think people in general realize what a tragedy it is every 
time a bus is injured. Lots of wanna-be-owners out there.

THanks for your interest,


Sean

p.s. Owners of bus-style single cab and crew cabs should also consider 
filling out the survey. I realize they are different vehicles, but the 
rarity of these vehicles orphans them to some extent and I think the general 
public should know more about them.
