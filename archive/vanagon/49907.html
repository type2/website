Subject: 1-nite get-together 10/12 at Muir Beach!




For a long time, I've been wanting for us all to gather at Pelican
Inn in Muir Beach, California (west of San Rafael).  This is a
British pub, complete with darts.  One can go there to drink, eat,
play, etc.  It's sort of off in the middle of not much else, and
very authentic English-country in style -a beautiful place.

Anyway, I'm proposing that those interested meet there for an evening
gathering on October 12th, beginning at 6 p.m.  Starting time
can be loose.  I think one can still order dinner at that time, or
if you just want to begin drinking early, that's ok too.  

I'll work on getting exact directions for you.  Despite being in
a remote setting, it's not difficult to find, nor very far to
get to.

Please let me know if you plan to attend.  So far, the Kautz family
and Bradley Prunehead have signed up.  And I know many more of
you have expressed an interest.

Thanks!

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
