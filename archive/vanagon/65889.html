Subject:      interior rear heat

hello all,

all this talk recently of interior heating of air cooled vans got me thin=
king too
about the upcoming winter.  (my first in the 80- westy).  while the front=

heat is actually pretty good ithink the rear heat may be lacking for pass=
engers.
(fro those of us w/o aux. heater)

what about tapping off hot-air duct that runs to the front of the van =
from the
heater boxes, splicing in another duct that goes directly into the
rear seat area?  come up thru the floor and put a vent in the rear seat
wood work (this is a westy remember).  make the vent and splice be able =
to be
closed to isolate if no passengers.  maybe put a 12volt fan in line to =
pull more
heat thru?  i would think duct work from home supply stores would work
nicely.  anybody ever try this?  it would entail cutting a hole in the =
floor
but you have to do that if you install an aux. heater, right?
