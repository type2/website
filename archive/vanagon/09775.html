     &gt;You can buy these from Wizard. They're not cheap, I think about 40 
     &gt;quid, but it would save a lot of work making your own. They 
     &gt;definitely work. A friend uses one to heat water for camping and it 
     &gt;gets a 10 gallon tank really hot after a 10 miles or so.
     
     I phoned up wizard and they sent me a &quot;brochure&quot;, well dodgy photocopy 
     of what you are supposed to do.
     
     I just fancy making one myself so the works no a worry, besides I've 
     not fired my Mig up in ages :)
     
     I am very interested in performance though and your friends figures 
     seem very promising - how hot is really hot ?? I figure you need about
     70 degrees water temperature to really feel the heat.
     
     I wonder if the Wizard ones had any sort of Heatsink inside them for 
     better conduction ?? like the air ones. And do you fit two ?
