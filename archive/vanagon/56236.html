Subject: Re: lowest mileage


I have to agree on the point that Volkswagens are meant to be driven....My 
1974 Thing had 200k miles when I sold it....my 86 GTI now has 215k miles and 
in the service of my son.....my 93 EV has 55k miles on it and I'm looking 
forward to having it for 10 years or more and seeing it roll to 200k miles.

To me the REAL badge of honor is long service....drive it every day with 
love.....

It is no badge of honor having a VW of any type (other than a brand new one) 
with a minimal amount of miles on it. IMHO....
