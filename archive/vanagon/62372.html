Kedar,

I've often thought this (your idea of a custom cover) would be the
ultimate solution. It even seems that the tie-downs could be used as lock
downs.  I guess its' not been made or we'd seen a posting by now.  It
doesn't seem that it should be *that* difficult to build from sheet metal,
but things usually look easier to do than they are.  If I were designing
it, I think I would make the height pretty low, so as to be able to use
the vanagon going through parking structures and the like. 

Thanks,
Ivan

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has looked into having a cover made
&gt; for the luggage rack.  Wouldn't that cut down on air drag 
&gt; at highway speeds?
