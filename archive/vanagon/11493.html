Subject:       Radiator caps

(can you tell I'm in the office today?)

Here's some cap info:
'83  Uses a metal, conventioal style cap  readily available 
everywhere

'84-'85  uses a black cap pn 025 121 321 A,  you won't find it 
anywhere but the dealer.  I think this cap has been replaced with the 
cap for the '86 on--

'86 on-- blue in color and pn 025 121 321 B  dealer only item.  
$11.70 (not too bad)

They above info doesn't come from anywhere but my experience in 
trying to track down a cap for my '87.  It may be wrong, it may be 
right.  Corrections???
