&gt; Soak it with penetrating oil (many listees have said that &quot;Kroil&quot; works

&gt; hammer (I use the round head of a ballpeen hammer).  This sometimes
&gt; breaks the corrosion bond.  Try again.  Soak and repeat several times, if
&gt; still no, try a piece of pipe or breaker bar.  Be careful, you might
&gt; crank the head right off the bolt.  I would soak it for a few days before
&gt; giving up.

&gt; &gt; In checking out my '88 Westy, I decided to take a look at the spare,
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately the 19mm bolt that hold the tray that the spare rests on does
&gt; &gt; not want to come off. Any clever ideas? I was thinking of just finding a
&gt; &gt; garage with an air wrench that I could talk a mechanic to applying to the
&gt; &gt; bolt.
&gt; &gt;Just a Thought! maybe the spare is oversize and is binding the bolt try 
a small jack under the pan to take the pressure off the bolt and then 
lots of leverage on the wrench
good luck
