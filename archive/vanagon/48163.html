TWIMC:
I discovered yet another use for my prototype.Radiator fan circuit
continuity monitor!Whilst tooling around town marveling at the wind
powered LED gizmo I noticed it flicker when I hit a bump!Later on it
went out all together and I could not manually energize the high speed
fan!?
To make a long story short I traced the problem down to a degrading
ground connection at the multi-point ground connector behind the fuse
box. Actually I changed about six suspicious looking ground terminals!
No wonder I have only heard  the high speed rad fan come on twice in
five years!(Or maybe not.)
Y'all should check 'em grounds too.
