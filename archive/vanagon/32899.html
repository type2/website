Subject: much mail/subject lines

I vote that we keep one list. I enjoy reading about 
Splitties, Loafs, Vanagons and EuroVans. I cann't read
all of them but I like to see how people share problems, 
solutions and off-beat humur.

I do ask that people use an explicit subject line. Have
you ever tried to look for anything in the archives. Geez,
when I did a search for &quot;shock&quot;, as in shock absorbers
I got everything from electircal shocks to someone being 
shocked by the price of a part. Other searches have been
just as frustrating, where the subject line was no help at
all.

IMHO,
