Subject: People in California!

Hi California people,

My request is pretty simple. I'm trying to get hold of a CA state sticker.
You know the type you stick in your rear windshield to tell people where
you come from (as well as your plates).

I've got a fair collection European oval stickers like: D,A,CH,F,L,GB.

If anyone would send me a CA oval sticker I would be glad to pay for
the postage etc. or could swap one of my stickers.

Come to think of it, I'm interested in anything California for my Cal theme
Bus.

Lee.

'78 Cal Bus
