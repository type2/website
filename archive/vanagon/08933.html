&gt; &gt; Vroom!  Hark!  The following still need to sign up for the delicious
&gt; &gt; gourmet contributions they plan to bring to our Pfeiffer Friday evening
&gt; &gt; potluck:

Ok, I think we (Cassie camper ['89 Westy], myself, wife Leslie,
friends/wanabes Jeff &amp; Holly, and, of course, Kira the mini lapador...)
can commit to this pilgrimage to Westyland.

Since I'm now a participant, comments/questions:

    Fish stew - I've become pretty adept at Boulubaise (sp?), which is
	basically fish/shellfish with (canned) tomatoes, onions and 
	herbs - I actually served it to the masses (family/friends) at
	Xmas dinner. I'm willing to bring all the non-fish 
	ingredients (BIG pot, tomatoes, onions, herbs) and throw in
	the fish/shellfish people bring.


    Seminars - I'm capable (I think) but not experienced (I know) of 
	working on Cassie, so I'd be interested in having someone
	show me some of the following:

		Oil change (don't laugh...)
		CV joint inspection/repair
		Brake inspection/repair
		Coolant replacement/refill
		Belt checks
		Oxy Sensor inspection/repair
		Plugs, etc.
		???

	I don't need to have these things done during the trip,
	but some kind of group walk through (complete with unique
	lore derived from experience) might benefit all (experienced
	and less experienced) - kind of give a hands on version
	of reading the Bentley book.

	Maybe one of the more experienced participants could bring
	a few tools, etc. needed.


I'd be willing to come up with a (loose) schedule for these seminars if
people are interested - I'd need to know who is capable of teaching
what and how long each seminar might take - I don't think we'd want to
spend more than 3-4 hours of the weekend total on these seminars.
