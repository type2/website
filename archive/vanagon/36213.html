Subject: Re: 68 vw bus $550 runs &amp; looks great (Concord, Bay Area)

Just so everybody who wants to know knows.  I am going to go down Tuesday
and take a look at it.  probably will buy it if it is in good shape.  My
wife tells me I can only end up with ONE bus so either this one or the one
I have may end up being a parts bus.  Anyhoo, will let you know either way.
