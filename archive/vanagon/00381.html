Subject: 85 Vanagon Camper goes up in flames

In August 93 my 1985 Vanagon Camper's engine caught fire
while driving on an Interstate. The fire spread very quickly and 
in a matter of few minutes the van was totally destroyed. 
The van was very well maintained (I was the original owner of it)
and had about 54000 miles on it. I have written to VW several times
but have not received any explanation of what might have caused it.

I posted this story on rec.autos.vw and got few responses, including,
response from one person who had a similar problem with their 66 Bug.    

I would like to hear from the readers of this list as to the possible
causes of this unfortunate incident. I would really like to get to the
bottom before I decide to buy a used Vanagon or a new EuroVan. (I loved the
Vanagon) 

Thanks.
