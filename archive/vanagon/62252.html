Subject: Re: Winshield seal

&gt;Never, ever re-use a window seal.  Seems no matter how much silicone or
&gt;other sealing agent is used in the installation, that window seal will
&gt;always leak, especially windshield seals.  Having made window seals for
&gt;Bugs and Buses since 1976, I learned this the hard way when the old/used
&gt;seal looked in good shape to re-use.
&gt;

I've had the seal reused on several different windshield replacements, and
they have NEVER leaked.  I guess some are luckier than others.

James
