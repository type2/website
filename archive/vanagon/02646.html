&gt;Anyone know how hot you can get your Bus gearshift knob, steering wheel,
&gt;glovebox knob, etc.?  Will they stand, say, 300 degrees F for half an hour?
&gt;Will they melt, or burn?

one of the operation folks has a little article cut out from some magazine
that shows the temps inside a car (with outside temp = 105 F). the dash
gets up to 233F, and the gearshift area runs around 157 - 183 F (depending
on what you call the gearshift area).

one way to find out is to trapse over to a junkyard, pick up a few odds and
ends and stick them in the oven. :)

i'd bet they would stand up to 200 F for over an hour. but 300?

&gt;Nevermind why, if I told you you'd send someone to take me away ;-) ...

i don't know if you can powder-blast plastic, carl. :)
