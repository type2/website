Ken,

Nice writeup, sounds like a very sano wiring job!  I have a collection of
bosch relays from cars long since dead.  How do I determine (if the amp
rating isn't noted on the case) the amp ratings of the relays so I can
choose the appropriate one for this task--is this an ammeter only job or is
there a way to fudge it without an ammeter?  I think someone mentioned a
horn relay would work, but without translating the VW part # you probably
couldn't tell a horn relay from any other.  

And for wiring, I believe the bosch relays have numeric codes imprinted next
to each terminal.  I think 30 would be from the battery and 15 would be out
to the solenoid, but I'm not sure what the numeric designation of the
&quot;trigger&quot; would be.  Hey, I paint by numbers, why can't I wire by numbers?!
ZZZzzzap.
