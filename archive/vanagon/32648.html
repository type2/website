Subject:       83 Waterboxer for Sale

Dear folks,

I have a 83 4 sp manual trans waterboxer for sale.  Will consider all 
offers.

I must reduce the number of vehicles I'm insuring - (2 teenagers 
driving).  Since moving to Mississippi, my insurance has tripled - 
with no change in coverage or conditions.  This is due to outmoded 
stupid people in the Insurance Commissioner's Office and lawmakers 
not willing to pass reasonable laws dealing with auto insurance.

The van has a new paint job in original colors - brown and tan.  We 
completely stripped, sanded, resealed seams, primed and repainted the 
van.  Every part possible was removed to give as colse to factory 
type painting as possible.  We also added brown pinstriping along 
tan/brown paint lines.  Also we added the Syncro wheel lip guards to 
the van to protect the paint job.

The interior is original and is immaculate.  

The van has new disc brakes, muffler, and new VW waterpump.  The 
clutch, pressure plate, throwout bearing and seals (all new VW parts) 
were replaced about 20K ago.  I have every maintenance and repair 
work order ticket available to verify maintenance record and repairs.

I've owned the van since it was new.

Van is in Starkville, Mississippi.  Work number is (601) 325-1908 - 
Home is (601) 324-1739.



Butch
