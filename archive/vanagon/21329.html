Subject: Front Wheel Bearings 71 Bus

Hi folks,

I'll be installing new inner&amp;outer front wheel bearings for the 1st time on
my 71.  I'd like some advice on removing and installing the inner races.
How to remove is probably obvious once the hub is off (right?).  Bentley
says you need to have the inner race pressed in.  Is it possible to get it
in by freezing it and then driving it in with a disc-like item (i.e. frozen
chocolate chip cookie or something similar).  

On a somewhat related note:  When I did the CVs on our rabbit I couldn't
quite get the circlip that holds the joint on the shaft into its groove.
Bentley says the joint hub must be pressed in place (to depress the dished
washer) for the circlip to be seated. When I took it to VW to be pressed on
the mechanics told me to use a 30mm socket to hammer the hub down and the
circlip would seat--that's what they do.

So my question is--who uses all those fancy tools pictured in Bentley if the
folks at VW don't.  Is this some sort of hoax????
