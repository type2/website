I've always used a timing light.
In a pinch I would static time to get it running.  Then turn the dist
a bit until it &quot;sounded right&quot;.  Use a timing light for best results.

&gt;Fuel guage:  my fuel guage always shows that there's always half as much
&gt;fuel as there really is in the tank.

My fuel gauge read empty when it was 1/2 full.  I replaced the sending
unit in the fuel tank.  Now it is accurate again.
A great time to fix this is while the engine is out getting that oil
leak plugged up.  ;-)
