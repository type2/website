Subject: RE: talk me outta this...

Bro, I feel for ya.  I hope you can get it together.
I've decided to buy a real rusty 68 bug and harvest the dual port 1600.  I 
talked to the lady last night and it'll be $225.  A cheap engine. I'll have 
to use one of those adapter plates though.

BTW, I did pull my engine all the way apart, and my brand new cam has 
snapped off right at the gear.  Of course, what did you expect with a whole 
piston in bits and pieces flying around in the case.  Right now, it looks 
like this will be at least $200 to fix, and a whole lot of time too.  I 
think that I'll put it together over the summer for my spare.  

My advice is get those parts and piece it together.  Remember- all engines 
run on used parts.
