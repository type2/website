&gt;     Who took the EV to 100 mph? I own a 93 MV and you would be RED
&gt; LINING to get to 100mph, i'll buy 90 mph.

Hey Now,
I took MY EV to 100mph, all be it, not for an extened time but it hit 100 and I
figured well fast enough for me.  I bought my 95 EV in March and waited untill
&quot;the nameless bus&quot; had 10K miles on it before I went for the &quot;Stock VW Bus land
speed record&quot;. Aside from thinking wow this thing cooks, I forgot to check the
tack to see if I was in the red or not, probably so...If I was UNwise enough
to take my EV to 100 mph you can bet I wasn't that worried about redline...
shmed line.

I tell you that optimum cruzing speed in my van is 80mph. For some reason my
EV has a vibration that bothers me when I drive between 60-70 mph. A buddy
of mine has a 77 westy and says his bus will go 80 as well, but any wind
or turbulance causes um...a bumpy ride. The much heavier EV does not have
that problem. Getting back to the vibration problem, I think it might be
a bad rim in the right rear since that is where most of the vibration seems
to eminate from. I have already had the dealership re-ballance all of the
wheels but that didn't help. When I test drove the other 4 EV's before
purchasing mine I felt that they were slightly smoother at 60 mph. The only
difference between them and the one that I bought was anti-lock brakes.
Somehow I don't think that would affect the cruzing ability of a camper.

In fact I have many opinions about the features of the EV but they will have to
go into another post.
