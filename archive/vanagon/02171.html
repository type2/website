62 VW camper bus for sale. I've owned it since 1975, I'm reasonably
sure it has the original running gear. The interior is not fantastic,
the front seats need covers. It has around 50k miles on it. Rear
bumper is not original. 
I have many spare parts for this - at least 3 engines, 1 transmission,
front window glass, roof rack. It runs good and has a new battery (6V).

$1000/BO. call 916-652-6623 (Auburn, CA. area) if you'd like to see
it or need more info.
