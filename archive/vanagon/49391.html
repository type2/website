Subject: wheel bearing question


Hi,

I'm going to change the front wheel bearings in my 83.5 westy tonight and
I have two important questions that I am hoping someone can answer. 1) Is
the peening nut size 46mm? and 2) Can I get away with putting the old
peening nut back on until mon when the new ones come from the dealer? TIA.

Dave
