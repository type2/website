Subject:      fender flares (lips or whatever) PLEASE READ

hello all, I just checked out Coyotes Vanagon_dot_com site and saw the pics of
the fender flares or lips or whatever you want to call those wheel arch
extensions..  :&lt;)
NOTE:
people w/ vanagons with the fiberglass rocker mouldings...
this MAY not fit.
not sure, but it looks as if these fender flares will come into conflict w/
the fiberglass rocker mouldings on the front door bottoms, (at least on the
campers) and possibly behind the front wheel arch for those w/ the full side
rocker mouldings.
I don't know this for sure, but it may be something to look into.
Has anyone ever seen a Van with these fender flares AND the fiberglass rocker
mouldings??
Todd Francis, does your Tri Star have both??

anyone??

this needs to be adressed before a group purchase.....
