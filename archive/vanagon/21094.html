To All:

I saw a home-brewed window-mount evaporative air cooler on an International
Travel-All south of the border.  Looked like it was made out of a 5 gallon
kerosene can, the square kind.  Had a little whirly-gig-sorta propellor,
apparently running some kind of pump, driven by the vehicle's forward motion.
 Seemed to be working; they smiled &amp; waved.  (Arizona plates)
