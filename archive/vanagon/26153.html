(snip)

&gt;&gt;I would like to replace the damaged line before starting south but a quick
&gt;&gt;tour of the local parts houses got me the usual Metric Response --
&gt;&gt;sucking-in of breath accompanied by a sad shake of the head, as when asking
&gt;&gt;for Mastodon Nose at a Chinese restaurant. Suck, shake, &quot;So solly.  No have.&quot;


     Bob:
     Although not the preferred method of repair, how about a few
     compression fittings from that same FLAPS? In a pinch, I have used the
     US sized sleeves on Metric lines..It just takes a little, um,
     persuasion to get them on (I have had to use a small round file to
     open up the sleeve before, also!).

     Best of luck, valiant traveler!
