Subject: Re: Rear Hatch Screens Now Available (Was Re: New Item Available Posted 6-12)

&gt;Is there such a thing as a window screen for the driver side and 
&gt;passenger side front windows? (sliding/velcro?) If so, where can I order 
&gt;the same, and at what price?

Randy, 
JC Whipme (312.431.6102) has 'em for &quot;all vanagons&quot; (their number 12xx2743R,
$33.95/set). &quot;Magnetic vinyl attaches easily.... &quot; looks like it goes on the
outside.

I wish they had them for my van!

No connections... usual disclaimers...
