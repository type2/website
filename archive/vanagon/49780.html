John;
	Have you given any thought to doing it yourself. I know it sounds
intimidating but as my neighbor told me before I did my first one &quot;Aint
nutin to eet&quot;.
	Do you know which side is leaking? The passenger side is a tad
easier to fix. 
Get a manual, a head gasket repair kit and a case of beer( to celebrate
with of course).

Good Luck
