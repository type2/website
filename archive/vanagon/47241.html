Subject: Thanks Malcom, cool bus spotted

	Malcom, thanks for the explanation of 'piston slap' as the
skirts striking the bore... I'm certainly hoping to be able to
afford (and find) an EV when We become Three...

	Sunday morning, big as life in west San Jose, a pal and I
saw a Mexican T2 with tall top, nose radiator and presumably straight
4 in the back! Really shiny sealing wax red, including the top. Looked
like it had Baja California plates, white with pale green letters, same
aspect ratio as US plates. Alas- what a pretty bus!

	Happy motoring, all!
	Bill
