Subject: Rear Lights problem

hey now,

i knew i had problems with my right rear brake, reverse, and running lights...
but until i really looked and investigated the problem...wow. i knew i had a
little rust problem on the metal plate but yesterday i was scraping it and
poked right through it! so it looks like i have to replace the whole thing.
the bulbs look good but i don't think i'm getting a ground. how expensive are
this part and how hard is it going to be to replace it? i don't think i can
even unscrew the bulb without the whole thing falling apart!
