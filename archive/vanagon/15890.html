I agree with Corbin on this one. I remember it being a tight squeeze trying to 
pull out the generator/fan assembly, and I think I had to remove some of the 
screws for the fan shroud so I could tilt it back a little.

Once you get it out, don't be surprised if the fan bolt is really tight. One 
time I had to run down to the gas station and get the guy to spin it off with an
impact wrench. And I _really_ tried to do it by hand.

This is a &quot;roadside repair&quot;. Definitely no engine pull required.

&gt; &gt; I thought you could pull the generator without dropping the engine, you 
&gt; &gt; need 
&gt; &gt; a large wrench/socket to get onto the nut that's nearest the fire wall/gas 
&gt; &gt; tank and another to fit the pulley end. Brace the hidden wrench against the 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; engine case, use so blocks of wood 2&quot; x 4&quot; etc. and keep some pressure on 
&gt; &gt; with the other wrench until things are braced and you can really reef on 
&gt; &gt; it. 
&gt; &gt; It eludes me how to keep the generator shaft still for this operation if 
&gt; &gt; needed however.  Anyone? tim s.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you can plug in an overnite battery charger maybe you can put this off 
&gt; &gt; indefinately?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; You can do this easier by pulling off the carb, extracting the generator 
&gt; and the fan (via the four small bolts in the fan housing face) and then 
&gt; dealing with the gen., and fan outside the vehicle-- just torque that 
&gt; large fan bolt properly when you have the new generator attatched to the 
&gt; fan housing plate and the fan itself. ---Piece of Cake!!! WITHOUT 
&gt; DROPPING THE ENGINE!!!!!!!! just have a milkcrate to sit on.-a must!
