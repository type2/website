i think part of the confusion over your kombi is that there are a bazillion
different variations on the camper theme, anything from the professionally
completed Westies, Dormobiles, Devon Caravanettes, Sundial Campers etc.
etc. etc. to the more hokey backyard butcher jobs w/ shag carpeting and
plywood.

soooooooooooooo........

what i would say is it sounds like you have a Kombi w/ some form of camping
equipment (by the sounds of yours would be aftermarket or homemade). The
general rule of thumb i use is

&quot;how professional does the conversion look?&quot;, do the cabinets look well put
together and stong, or are they just hokey plywood? Look at the hardware
fittings etc. Are they the sort of thing you pick up at a hardware store,
or are they the sort of thing that was specially made for the van? A bit of
exploring should probably give you a good idea.

One final note, if you write to the factory w/ your VIN, you can get the
definitive answer. BTW Westfalia conversions start out life as a Kombi, and
will appear as so on documentation from the factory.

&gt;&gt;I'm too lazy to quote from a digest right now, but I'm a little confused
&gt;&gt;about the definition of &quot;Kombi&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;here we go again!! :)  so is everybody else (confused, that is). actually,
&gt;some folks KNOW what a kombi is, but can't prove it. ;)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I saw someone mentioned that a C/Kombi was a bus that had removeable
&gt;&gt;seats and could function as a passenger and cargo hauler.
&gt;
&gt;about the only thing we've all agreed on is that:
&gt;(1) VW made buses called Kombi's.
&gt;(2) Kombi's are NOT Deluxe buses.
&gt;(3) Kombi's are NOT Pickup Trucks.
&gt;(4) Kombi's have windows.
&gt;(5) Kombi's were used as the basis for MOST Camper conversions, but are NOT
&gt;    the same as Campers.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've been told/led to believe that it is a Kombi.  Am I right?
&gt;
&gt;probably you are right, but someone made it into a camper. if you checked the
&gt;VIN of the bus, it would be a Kombi.  i would call it a &quot;Day-Camper&quot; myself,
