Subject: Thanks

I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation for all the wonderful
advice I received from this list on what kind of price to expect when
trading in or selling my 91 Vanagon Carat.  I not only got answers to the
questions I posed, but many people took pity on my naivete and gave me
advice beyond the pricing info.  I am really grateful that so many were
nice enough to take the time to respond; it's another testimonial to the
power of the Internet and the basic goodness of people, IMHO.  I am active
on other lists, mostly connected with *my* interest, dog training and
behavior, and have been in the position many times of *giving* advice to
neophytes; now I know how helpless a person can feel when stepping outside
of his/her area of expertise, and how grateful for the kindness of others
who are proficient in that area.

Anyway, I probably would have gotten &quot;taken&quot; when trading in my van,
because I was seriously underestimating its value.  Now I still may get
taken, but it won't be you guys' fault.  You were great!

I'll be signing off this list today, but if I can reciprocate in any way by
giving advice on dog training or behavior, or choosing a dog, or anything
like that, I'd be more than happy to help.

Thanks again!
