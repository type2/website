k
&gt; &gt;  If you're near Palo Alto, call me at 415 857 8249. I'll buy lunch.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you inviting all of us?
&gt; 
&gt; Bob
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like fun. If I'm buying, the quality of lunch will decline in
 proportion to the number of people eating, but it's the camaraderie
 that counts, right? Right? Bob, are you there? Do you like pizza?
