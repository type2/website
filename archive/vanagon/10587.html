--Joe Clark said:--
&gt; Your '71 has two adjustable linkages that go from the front handle to
&gt; rear latch.  Pull the interior panel.  Both latch assemblies as well as
&gt; the top and bottom front rollers come out.  The swing-pin and its
&gt; track-runner can be removed (remove the beltline trim). Take that puppy 
&gt; off and _soak_ them parts in solvent.
&gt; 
&gt; 


Would it be of any use to take the interior panel off to get at
the linkage -without- taking the door off?  I've done the door
thing before (to replace the rubber) and it is not fun.
