Subject:       Re: Camping in the Rain


&gt; What's the best way to protect the canvas in a Westy top from the rain? 
&gt; Pack it up and go home?  Does it need to be kept dry?  I'm told it
&gt; shouldn't be put away wet.  Got my first camping trip planned for the
&gt; weekend after Easter.  Rain could be in the offing.  Any advice would be
&gt; appreciated.  Thanx!

Hi Jon.  You just can't help but get the canvas wet.  The key here is 
to make sure the canvas get dry out.  I always make sure to air it 
out asap after arriving home.  I am lucky in that I have a 10' 
ceiling in my garage can leave my top almost fully extended to dry 
it.  

When I'm not using the van for a while, I put in a Dri-Z-Air 
container and let it collect excess moisture in the van.  This works 
extremely well over long periods.

Harry.
