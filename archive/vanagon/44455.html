                      The KC Run - Prologue

Greenbuss sits stunned, spraddle-legged by a ton of cargo.  
Three hundred pounds of gasoline distend her belly, a 
firebomb worthy of the Slaughter House Five.  In the cargo 
bay are twenty pounds of oil, pressure flasks of oxygen, 
acetylene and propane.  I light my pipe, fire-up the engine 
and sit puffing while the 1600cc powerplant warms its hands 
over the internal fire. When the little engine sez its ready we 
go acreeping up the back drive, do a reverse-turn and head 
for my test track, a stretch of city streets, county roads and 
a high-speed strip of I-15.

High speed is a joke in Greenbuss with her heavy load.  Her big
engine is on the bench in the shop, victim of heaven knows what -
- possibly nothing at all save hypercaution on my part.  The big
engine handled the load with disarming ease, accelerating up
grades I now struggle to stay above thirty and fail.  But on the
flat she rolls just fine.  I let her roll while I listen to the
wheel bearings.

With the big engine punting Greenbuss with effortless ease I'd
planned to reach Kansas City via Colorado, to park at the crest
of Independence Pass along the way and snap a picture of the 
green bus and me to hang beside the one of us at Bad Water.  

Independence Pass is 12,095 feet above sea level, Bad Water 
 282 feet below.  

When it comes to engines I prefer to leave nothing to chance. 
The object is to arrive in Kansas City in a timely fashion, not
do another Grendel.  A few days ago the big engine developed 
a sound I could not identify.  And I'm already two weeks late 
on the Kansas City run.  With no time to play mechanic, 
I yanked the big engine and plugged in a trusty stocker.  The 
change will add a day to the run but with today's astronomical 
price of gas the savings in fuel will offset the cost of an added 
night on the road.  The change also ruled out climbing twelve 
thousand foot mountains while sitting down.  

As I struggle up the moderate grade by Lawrence Welk's place
the little engine tells me that with a ton of cargo onboard I will 
have to emulate the Joads and take the low road, dust-bowl bound. 

Backtracking the Okie Trail to Kansas City is a neat trick since
Route 66 or its modern-day analog, does not go through
Kansas City.  But if you hang a Louie at Okie City and pick
up the Kansas Turnpike at Wichita, Kansas City will be just over
the Topeka-event horizon.  It's not as elegant as climbing
Independence Pass but it will get me there, assuming nothing 
goes bump in the night.

I'm testing my front wheel bearings.  I've been testing things
for two weeks and have run out of meaningful things to worry
about.  Each time I increased the load I'd fly Greenbuss over my
test track, getting rid of rattles and checking her performance
which degraded steadily as the load grew past three quarters of a
ton.  Now that I've hit the one-ton mark I'm down to worrying
about things that don't care, unable to find fault because there
is none.  With the little engine Greenbuss is slow but stone 
reliable.  And I won't need to stop for fuel this side of 
the Kansas line.

That isn't to say life is without interest.  There is a funny
little click when I turn the steering wheel a certain way.  The
link arm between the steering box and the tie-rod lever is bent. 
I don't have a replacement and knowing the cause of the click --
the ball of the tie-rod end is over-riding the groove it's worn
in the socket -- I ignore it.  Or try to.  There is also the
heady scent of gasoline in the air.  I have 45 gallons of fuel
onboard, the three tanks relieved by five vent-lines.  The smell
is less at speed, more when I struggle up a grade.  It too I
ignore.  Except when I light my pipe.

The wheel bearings are fine, as I knew they were.  I've greased
them and adjusted them and checked the toe-in and adjusted the
brakes -- I'm fresh out of excuses.  I cut the run short.  It's
past midnight and I'm tired.

Tomorrow I'll fill my thermos, throw some clothes in
a bag and head for Kansas City.  I don't know the exact distance. 
I think it's about sixteen hundred miles from San Diego.  I'll
know once I get there.
