&gt; Got a call from a local fellow (Walter R. Ernst, Ph.D., Professor
&gt; Emeritus, Physics, to be exact) looking for a Westfalia Pop-Top Camper.
&gt; He said he was willing to spend upwards of $10K for one.

With that kind of budget, he should find a dandy air-cooled Westy. Since
I have been looking for an air-cooled vanagon West as well, I can tell you
there are automatics out there, but no where Springfield.  I heard of one
in Joplin, but it needed something done to it.

Most of the availible Vanagon Westys that are listed on the Internet are
in California, although.

If things work out, I'll be buying Charles Webb's 81 Westy that is in South
Carolina.  I'll be flying out Thursday (3/29) and driving it back to Kansas
City.  I plan on camping out on the way back through western South Carolina,
Tennessee, Kentucky, and finally Missouri.

Later,
