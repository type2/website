Subject: Re:noisey lifter

I believe that ticking lifters are just one of the crosses that vanagon
owners must bear.  The majority opinion seems to indicate that such an
occurance is of no great concern.  In my own experience, just jacking
up  one end of my '85 can cause this to happen whereas my 83.5 can be
parked for 6 months without any sign of it.  Don't worry.
