Subject: Piston Pin?!


	I think I saw this mentioned whilst flipping through
the digest. The first time I pulled my pistons, I had my
brother support the pistions while I tapped the pins out with
an extension and a BFH.

	The second time I made a puller with a piece of all thread,
a nut, a nut ground on a bench grinder to be slight smaller than the
pin, but not pull through the hole, and a short piece of tube to allow
room for the pin to be pulled into.

Pretty fuzzy eh?  With a vice grip and a wrench I pulled the pins
with not beating, all by my lonesome.
(BTW, if anyone wants this wonderful tool, I'll never use it again,
free for the asking...)

If someone would like a picture of it, I can prolly sketch and scan 
something...
