&gt; My wife wouldn't travel without one. No smell if used according to
&gt; instructions.  I built a box for mine with a padded seat for use as a
&gt; extra seat behind the passenger.  Box holds TP, chemicals,
&gt; Porta-Potti, etc.  Shop around, one can sometimes find them on sale
&gt; at sporting goods places.  Mine has two sections, one for clean water
&gt; and one for the other stuff.  Push-on pump for flushing.  One bottle
&gt; of goo lasts for about 4 or is it 8 porta-potti filllings (bottle
&gt; made for full size RV's).  I mounted TP holder inside lid so's it's
&gt; available when lid is up.  Lacks privacy, but we're family anyway.
&gt; Should be mounted to bus so it won't move around, but I'm lazy
&gt; that way.  Only difficulty is emptying it.  Easiest to empty straight
&gt; into a toilet.  Messier if using an RV park's dump station.  Used
&gt; ours for our 4 month travel/honeymoon.  We have had it for over 13
&gt; years now. No problems.  Remember air pressure changes when changing
&gt; altitude.  Always open then close valve BEFORE settling into position,
&gt; otherwise a rude/wet awakening from the bottom end pressure and
&gt; residual water in the top end.  YEE HAH !

&gt; &gt; I'm thinking of buying a porta-potti for the old westy!  I was wondering
&gt; &gt; what those of you who have one think of them (especially, Inuvik
&gt; &gt; veterans who had to live with them for 3+ weeks)???  Do they smell up the
&gt; &gt; van?  Are they easy to operate?  Are they worth the space?
