Subject: Fwd: Administrator Soliciation for Replacement.

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

I'll participate in any effort to preserve the Vanagon list.  Please send
an address to which I can send a check to continue the list.  

Now may be the time to create a permanent organization.

One or two of our members are attorneys.  Others are accountants. Others
are students or educators. Others have esoteric involvements in business,
government, religion, science, and the arts. Others are retired.

Each of us is a person with occupations, talents or abilities, who could
provide pro-bono organizational support. We could confer and create a
cooperative, or an association, a non-profit organization, or some other
legal entity,for example, to perpetuate the list through financial
participation by its users with a goal to create a permanent structure.

I'll participate to any extent necessary, including a check for $50 to
begin whatever process- -volunteer or non-profit, or for-profit--necessary
to keep the List in existence.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Gang,
&gt; I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3
years
&gt; now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like
to
&gt; stop. I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron
Lussier
&gt; was  interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of
&gt; network resources and $$.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; By the end of this month, I will be turning it off.  Anyone interested in
&gt; taking on this job in any way is welcome to it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. Thanks for all the beer!
