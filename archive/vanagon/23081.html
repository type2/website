Subject: showers at wailaki


I realize that my reputation for showering at campsites where none
are offered has been subject to inordinate amounts of ridicule
(and perhaps not undeserved) in the past, but I wanted to inform
all of you about my intention to try out my latest &quot;invention&quot; for
showering on this upcoming trip.  I've ordered the thing I need,
which should be arriving UPS on Monday.  Assuming it does, I'll
bring it along, and you are all invited to use it.  If you wish to
participate, make sure you have the following:  propane (green
small cyl. Coleman-type), plus 4 D cell batteries.  If I recall
correctly, what I've just mentioned will provide 3 times the
fuel and power necessary for one average shower, so depending on
the number of people in your group wishing to shower, plan
accordingly.  Wailaki offers no other shower facilities.  You
will probably also have to BYOW (water  :).

It's a lot of work to camp cleanly  :)
