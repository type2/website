&gt;Also, when I positioned the distributer drive shaft, I
&gt;didn't get it exactly in the same place that it was when
&gt;I removed it, and the result is that when the number 1 cylinder
&gt;is at top dead center, the rotor points roughly perpendicular
&gt;to the case parting line.  This shouldn't matter, right?
&gt;Alls it means is that I'll have to rotate the distributer
&gt;to a slightly different orientation, right?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, all!

 It took me three tries at the correct distb drive location.  It _can_ be 
removed with a wicked magnet.  I got one at sears, with about a 4lb pull.  A 
must have.  You need to be concerned with the condenser/ vac cylinder 
witting the fuel pump.  I just went out and looked at my engine with the 
009, the condenser hits the fuel pump at certian posistions of rotation.  It 
sounds like you are only 20~30 degrees off, you make the choice.
