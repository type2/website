Subject: width of bay window bus

hi all

i realize this is _kinda_ an obscure post but relates to mypreviously posted dormobile roof quest. i was 
wondering what the _width_ of the roof was on a bay window bus. so all you bay windo owners out there if you 
happen to have a tape measure handy i would be curious to know the width of the roof on your bus!

THANKS!

michael
