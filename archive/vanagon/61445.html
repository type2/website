&lt;&lt; OK all you Vanagon Experts out there,
 	I am new to the list and have been searching the archives for info
 on what wheels and tires will fit on a stock '91 Vanagon GL. I see the
 15&quot;x7&quot; Borbet II wheels recomended, one post says something about a 16&quot;x8&quot;
 as well. My question is, will 15's or 16's fit, and do I have to size down
 the tires similar to the TireRack &quot;Plus Concept&quot;? I use the bus for all
 manner of things and would love to put larger wheels and tires on but don't
 know about clearence, performance etc. Does anyone have experience with
 this?
 Thanks in advance.

I saw a Vanagon at Maple Grove last weekend with 16&quot; alloys.
plenty of clearance.

Also - don't forget -  15&quot; Audi 5000 turbo alloy wheels will fit too after
the centers are machined. Easy to do - e-mail me for info.
