Subject: Need Transistor for Saphire I



Hi There!

Well, I took my Saphire I to a shop to see if they could do something about
the static.  They did.  They blew the transistor and now it does nothing but
humm.

And, he says he can't find the required replacement transistor.

I'm lucky he didn't try to charge me for the time he spent on 
it (not that I would have paid!).  All in all pretty disappointing.

Anyway, I copied the following info from the transistor:

Bendix
1859 - 6
437 1012
D 6

If anyone knows of a source of these transistors, please let me know.

Thanks,
...Markus
