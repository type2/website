Subject: Missing &quot;Stats Galore ... Who's Who in Eurovans&quot; ?

     Joel seem to be doing an extensive job with the statistics, 
     and I was was looking forward to see my name published in 
     the &quot;EV stats galore&quot; with the rest of the EV owners. 
     
     But so far I haven't seen the above mentioned statistics. 
     Maybe I have deleted it by accident, or maybe Joel is just 
     too lazy to bother with the EV-people (I don't think that is 
     the case).
     
     So Joel, if you have the EV statistics availavble, can you 
     please publish them here on the list. It will be much 
     appreciated!
     
     
     Thanks,
