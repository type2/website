Subject: 85 exhaust source needed

While on my trip from DC to NYC, my exhaust system decided it didn't want to
go along.  About 1/3 the way, the pipe that goes from the collector to the
cat broke off the collector.  (This is the pipe with the O2 sensor in it).  

I managed to get a local shop to weld the rusty pipes together for 20 bucks.
 It should get last till I can get it replaced. 

The problem is the only source I have been able to find for the exhaust pipes
have been the dealer.  Does anyone know of a source for these pipes with
reasonable prices?  My front pipe, cat &amp; exhaust are good.  I just need the
rear pipe and the pipe that the O2 sensor screws into.
