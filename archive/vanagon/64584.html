Subject:      Re: fuel pump?

Had a similar problem with my 80 Wanagon a couple a years back.  Culprit
was the Fuel Pressure Regulator.  Could be that, but check that filter
anyway.  Price on one of these are $47 (Air Cooled 83), $49.50
(Waterboxer 83).

Fuel Pumps aren't cheap.  Same one as my 84 (actually 75-91 Bus/Vanagon).
 German Pierburg is $182.58, Bosch a little less at $175.00 (I used a
Pierburg on my 84 when I replaced it, liked the fact that it has rubber
insulation surrounding it to help deaden the noise).

&gt;Problems have just begun with my 1983 Vanagon (air-cooled) after
&gt;nearly 20,000
&gt;trouble-free miles.  I believe that my fuel pump may be ready to call
&gt;it quits
&gt;since the symptoms are identical to the fuel pump problems I had on my
&gt;1986
&gt;Cabriolet.  Here are the symptoms:
&gt;
&gt;Cold starts are fine
&gt;idles erratically if left idling for a few minutes, eventually stalls
&gt;drives fine at highway speeds
&gt;stalls when slowing down to a stop
&gt;won't start right away after stall
&gt;will start when left to sit a few minutes
&gt;
&gt;Changed fuel filter about 6 months ago, but I'm not ruling this out.
&gt;I have not
&gt;heard any noise from the pump, but I have not thoroughly researched
&gt;this.
&gt;
&gt;I checked for vacumn leaks but found nothing obvious.
&gt;
&gt;I have researched the archives, but found nothing with identical
&gt;symptoms.
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be appreciated!
