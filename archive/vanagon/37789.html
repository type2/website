Subject: Re: Personalized License Plates  (vacuum advance p.s.)

&gt;p.s.)  I tried to check my vacuum advance by the suck-on-the-greasy-hose
&gt;       method, but it barely moved at all.  How much movement should I be
&gt;       looking for?

I suck on the hose and close it of with my tongue, then i release the vacuum
and look and listen for movement. If you think you have leak, try a piece
of new hose, if it's still leaking, look if the tube on the vacuumcannister
is made of black plastic, if it is it's probably loose in the housing and you
could glue it or apply a little sealer to it. If all this fails you'd have to
buy an new vacuumcannister, not easy since there are an lot of differences
in these things. I once replaced one in a '68 411 and instantly added a flat
spot because i just slapped one on without checking the numbers. Before tearing
things apart check if the pointplate is moveable in the first place, sometimes
they rust and bind, the vacuum can't overcome that.

Hope it helps,

Brian.
