&gt; the wires, but I just want to know what to get. Sounds like a great ignition
&gt; system, but I'm not looking foreward to getting the pis* shocked out of me every
&gt; time I try to tune up the engine. I've worked on a few with the GM H.E.I. They
&gt; flat out tell you in the shop manual that it's enough to kill you. I think it's
&gt; upwards of 80Kv, tho.
&gt; 
&gt; All suggestions welcome. I like salt.

&lt;grin&gt; If your wires are in good condition, they will probably handle 
the extra current. I would guess they might be in need of 
replacement, though. The insulation breaks down with age due to heat 
and oil. I'm not sure what current practice is, but we used to put solid 
core wires in our &quot;hot rods&quot; with the high voltage insulation (you can 
use resistor plugs to suppress ignition &quot;noise&quot;). In the &quot;good old days&quot; 
you could tell the good wiring sets because of their orange 
colored insulation.
