Subject: Re: Rear License Plate Door

&gt;Just remove the oil cap and pull on the neck of the tube. If at first you
&gt;don't succeed, keep pulling on it, and voila, the oil filler tube sticks
&gt;out of the access door behind the license plate.

Can also slice of a (upper) portion of the inner tube to allow you to get
the first spills from the oil container into the filler tube and not over
the trapdoor.  Tim
