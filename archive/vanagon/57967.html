Subject: reformulated gasoline

I'm curious.  My upstate NY 1991 Vanagon is going to be spending lots of
time on the road this summer, especially in California and other parts
west.  Do any of you who drive Vanagons in areas where only reformulated
gasoline is sold have any problems?  Or is this something I shouldn't worry
about.
