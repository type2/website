Subject: Re: 67 Volkswagen Deluxe Microbus - 21 Window - Sunroof

CC&gt;This classic Volkswagen bus is in good, restorable condition.  It is white 
CC&gt;over red.  The engine is from a 73 Beetle, 1600cc dual port with Bosch 009
CC&gt;distributor and Solex 31-PICT4 carb.  It has an alternator.  A recent 
CC&gt;compression test showed all cylinders around 130 psi.  The sunroof is new 
CC&gt;and is of the heavy canvas variety.  The seats and interior panels are in 
CC&gt;need of recovering but all covers are available mail-order.  1967 was
CC&gt;the last split-window bus and the first 12Volt bus so this is a special
CC&gt;year.
CC&gt;
CC&gt;This bus has only two serious flaws.  There is some rust under the front
CC&gt;wheel wells and the heat is not working.
CC&gt;
CC&gt;I've only had this bus since May but have taken it on several road trips
CC&gt;to Texas and Wisconsin and it has performed flawlessly.
CC&gt;
CC&gt;We are located in the Kansas City area, and our midwestern winters can get 
CC&gt;severe.
CC&gt;
CC&gt;I am willing to deliver this bus anywhere in the continental United States,
CC&gt;(it will make the trip, no problem), but the cost of my return trip to Kansas
CC&gt;City would have to be included in the price.
CC&gt;
CC&gt;If someone in a warmer climate is interested in this bus, or someone in
CC&gt;a less moderate climate has the funds needed to bring this old gal back to
CC&gt;perfection, please contact me via email or telephone and let's talk.

Waaaahhhh! This is just what I have been looking for, but I just bought a house
and am now in way over my head. Still sitting here fantasizing about 
driving it back from Kansas City.

Im back. Nice mind trip. Im not going to spoil it by asking how much he wants.
It is usually either $4500 or $450. Oh well.
