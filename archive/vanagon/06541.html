&gt; 
&gt; 87 Westphalia Syncro GL, PS, AC, 4spd, 2.1L
&gt; 
&gt;     17-18 city
&gt;     20-21 hwy 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to see any other 4x4 RV top that.

I'd like to see my non-camper '87 GL Syncro top that!  I get around 15
city and get 20 highway.

I was bored this weekend, so I took a short trip down to the West Coast
Pre-Trip gathering spot at Pfieffer.  Travel time from El Cerrito, CA,
was 2:45 (to the park entrance).  I drove a max 65 mph (could have
driven faster), got 20 mpg round trip.

About the location:  On the coast, it was sunny and warm and windy, and
very picturesque, with lots of waves crashing against empty beaches and
amazing rock formations.

Pfeiffer is not on the beach, but is inland a few miles in a stand of
redwoods.  They smell very very very nice!  A great fresh pine scent!  The
temp in woods was quite cool, and since there's no sun to warm you, feels
even colder.  I didn't enter the park, so I can't comment on the facilities
within.  Lots of really beautiful scenery just a short caravan drive away,
and the redwood forest to welcome you home after going out exploring!
Does anyone know the hours for the lighthouse?  I drove past on Sunday,
and it was closed then.  I remember reading somewhere that it's only open
a few days a week.

Anyway, the Big Sur area seems like an awesome place to have a Van 
gathering!

&gt; 
&gt; Wait, there aren't any other 4x4 RVs (Unimog excepted, of course).
&gt; 

Look in this month's issue of &quot;Four Wheeler&quot; (I think.  One of those 
four-wheel drive truckin' mags).  They have a 4 page pictorial of the 
European 4-wheeldrive truck show.  There's  a picture of the &quot;little&quot;
Unimog, and also a big Unimog RV, which comes equipped with a washing
machine!  Some neat pictures of rigs from Eastern Europe and Russia, and
lots of Japanese 4by's that don't get imported into the US.

Happy reading,

-Jim
