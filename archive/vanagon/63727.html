Subject: Seattle Area Mechanics (Watercooled)



&gt;I would appreciate any suggestions from my venerable Seattle area Vanagon
&gt;brethern for reliable, capable and economical Seattle (preferably north
&gt;Seattle) VW repair shops specializing in watercooled Vanagons.  I've been
&gt;using Carter VW since I bought my '91 Westy from them 6 years ago, and
&gt;while I've found them to be superlative in the reliable and capable
&gt;departments - and even though they've given me the occassional break on a
&gt;service charge - between flat rate and $65/hr shop rates, they're still
&gt;pretty pricey.
&gt;
&gt;So I feel it's time to start beating the bushes for a shop that can offer
&gt;quality, VW trained mechanics and doesn't have the overheads of a dealer
&gt;operation.  I know there used to be a few around - Hermann's in the U.
&gt;District (no longer handles VW) and Akers on Capital Hill (air-cooled
&gt;only), and assume there still are.  I'm just a little out-of-touch on the
&gt;local scene now and would appreciate some advice.
&gt;
&gt;TIA.

&gt;Try Bothel Import Service on the Everett Bothel highway, just south of Mill
Creek.  They have done a couple of things for me, they are not just VW
mechanics they are VW fanatics!
19319 Bothell-Everett Hwy   481-3210  Oh yea, the owners work has been seen
in a Hot VW's spread!
