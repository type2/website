Subject:      importing a EV Westi

I have found, and wish to import from Canada to the US, a 1994 Westfalia
EV.  I have seen and driven the Winnebago EV and I have researched the
Westfalia EV.  I prefer the Westie EV.  I am now in the process of figuring
out what has to be done to get the proper approvals.  It is EPA OK for the
US and California.  The question is if it meets Department of
Transportation safety standards.  I gather that I need a letter from VW and
from DOT saying that it does meet standard (or doesn't and needs
modifications).  Anyway, the EV Westie that I have found is what I want and
we have agreed upon a price assuming that it can be imported.

If anyone has any information about the struggles of buying and driving a
VW from Canada to the US, I'd be pleased to know.  Issues include EPA
certification, DOT certification, duty, title, registration.  I'd
appreciate any help from someone who may have been through the process,
particularly with a EV Westfalia.

Thanks, Tim
