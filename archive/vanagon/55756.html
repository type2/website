Subject: Re: Needed - EV Oil Filters

&gt;Some time ago (about two years, I think) there was some traffic about
&gt;getting oil filters for the Eurovan in bulk or from some source (mail
&gt;order) OTHER than a VW($) dealer and saving a few bucks. I've searched   
&gt;my old message traffic and can't find anything like that.
&gt;
&gt;In my locale (Saint Louis or Joplin, MO are the nearest dealers - both
&gt;100+ miles away) the Eurovan oil filter is still listed as a 'dealer
&gt;only' item, and it costs BIG bucks!
&gt;
&gt;Got any informationj on a source for Eurovan filters that you can pass me?
&gt;

I could get these for $8.75 each (OEM, Volkswagen brand, part #074115561), 
if purchasing a few at a time.  (Frankly I have no idea if this is a good 
deal or not.  Maybe you can tell me.)
