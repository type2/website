Volks,

I am going to be repacking the CVs sometime soon, so I will be making
the trip to the FLAPS today. I forget offhand, do the inner CVs on 
a '71 Bus have CV grease in them, or are they lubricated by tranny oil?

I know the beetle ones are grease, but I have not done the inners on the
Bus, so I dont remember what Iread about it.
