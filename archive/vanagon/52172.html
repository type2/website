Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

Right. This is the cheapo model I use, Interdynamics. I like it a lot.

&gt;For what it's worth, I bought one at Kmart about 1-1/2 yrs ago for roughly 
&gt;$17.00.  There were two there, a few bucks apart.  The one I bought was the 
&gt;sturdier looking of the two, brand name Interdynamics, 200 psi. (The 
&gt;cheaper one was labeled 250 psi, but just looked flimsier so I passed on 
&gt;it.)  I've used it many, many times since then.  A little slow (maybe 15 
&gt;minutes from flat to full, definately not 40 minutes!), but has proven 

15 mins x 4 tires = 60 mins.

&gt;extremely reliable.  Gets a little hot to the touch after prolonged use, 
&gt;but has never overheated or failed.  It's helped me out of a bind many, 
&gt;many times - best $17 I ever spent!  I keep it in my Vanagon at all times. 
&gt;If my experience with reliability is typical, I'd recommend this one.
