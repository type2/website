As I recall from my limited experience, white smoke usually means that
there is water leaking into the block, black smoke means oil.  I don't have
the details of a 1:1 ratio on water production to gas burning (from an
earlier message), but if I had a water-cooled engine I would have it looked
at.

&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt; 
&gt; I too notice this upon the first start in the morning. Along with white
&gt; smoke that lasts about a minute or so. No overheating problems, some
&gt; periodic &quot;topping off&quot; needed in warmer weather tho'.
&gt; 
&gt; Never knew about the water generated from combustion engines, guess I
never
&gt; gave it much thought.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; &gt; jg:
&gt; &gt; About a gallon of water is produced for every gallon of gasoline burnt.
&gt; &gt; All signs of it should vaporize though, after the engine reaches
&gt; &gt; operating temperature.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Yesterday I noticed an unusual amount of water being spit out from my
&gt; &gt; &gt;exhaust.  I was a good 10 feet away from the exaust and could see rain
&gt; &gt; &gt;drop sized drops spewing forth...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;How much (if any) water is normal in exhaust?  What horrific disease
&gt; &gt; &gt;could my baby have??
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;anxiously awaiting...
