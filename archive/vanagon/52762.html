&gt; How about the cabins in Lakeside village, on Huntingdon lake. I used to
know
&gt; the guy  who ran the resort, Steve Sherry, I will call him if Huntingdon
Lake
&gt; is OK. This is at 75000 ft above Shaver LAke behind Fresno. There is a
ski
&gt; resort next to the Lodge &amp; I think the road is snowploughed in the
winter.
