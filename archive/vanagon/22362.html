Subject: Back from Europe

Well 20 days in a Eurovan Westy, from Stuttgart to Bremerhaven to Potsdam,
Dresden, Prague, Munich, the Alps a bit, Liechtenstein (why not?) and back
to Stuttgart.

Conclusions: Europe is expensive (1 Cdn $ = 1 DM while I was there).
Gasoline is 56 cents here, 1.42 there (Cdn/liter, thus around US$4/USgal).
But we were buying diesel at 1.08, and getting much better mileage to boot.
In fact, frequently we came in around 8 liters/100 km, which is about 30
mpg.

Flat out on the autobahn we didn't get any 30 mpg, but we did get up to 140
kph, and then van ran like a charm. Steady, easy, stable. Seemed to love
it. ABS and two airbags, too, for security.

Cornering in the mtns is limited by the coffee jar rolling around and
hitting the schnapps bottle. I keep intending to pack with plenty of
styrofoam, but the best laid plans...

We are the first couple ever to transport a porta-potty over the Atlantic
and back! I saw one in Walmart: made in Holland. Well, why not buy one in
Germany? Because they're going to cost double over there. Why not buy one
here, leave it in the box, hand it to the airline clerk and pick it up in
Stuttgart. So we did. They are great things. Yes we cleaned it thoroughly
before the return trip (do you have anything to declare? Citrus fruits?
Been on any farms recently?).

Going up the autobahn near Braunschweig I was doing 110 kph and was passed
(with no effort) by a '48 Chevy panel truck. Hmm. They couldn't do 80 mph
stock, could they? The sides were covered with ads for a Harley-D dealer.
One wonders just what kind of equipment was underneath.

Not many Trabants left, and those that do exist belong to students. No more
junkyards in Germany; even front-ended cars get towed to Poland, Czech Rep,
etc. And, complained a Dutch couple in the next campground, some get
removed there when they're still perfectly healthy: a bit of the midnight
auto syndrome. Well, Mercedes disappear from the streets of Toronto to a
waiting container and then off to Lagos, so no surprise.

Campgrounds in Germany are a mess. Unconscionably crowded (where shall I
park? Oh, anywhere. Take your choice.). Frequently noisy late at night. The
worst was a group of toughs drinking beer and laughing uproariously until
about 4AM. The next morning I asked the elderly couple next to us, &quot;Are you
German?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;That was some noise last night.&quot; &quot;Ach, schrecklich, das
was fuerchtbar.&quot; (= Terrible, awful). Me: I'm surprised no one called the
police. Him: There are no police here anymore. All they do is stand around
and collect their salaries.

Aha, I realized then that I was in the East of Germany, aka East Germany. I
guess the modern police was, generally, also a cop in the old days when the
state had authority and hoodlums could be dealt with. Now in the modern
westernized Germany there are restrictions on how police can deal with the
public (whadya mean no more rubber hoses?). So their attitude is to do
nothing. Tain't that way in the West, I'm informed. So there's still some
social engineering to be done.

All in all, we paid US$100/day for the vehicle. Campsites ran around 20DM
per nt, usually with a hot shower available. Beyond that it's groceries
(higher than here, but tolerable), fuel (I didn't spend much in 4,000 km)
and admissions (cheap: even great art galleries are about 4DM).

So I'd have to say it's an expensive way to travel. Even cheaper is to rent
a standard car, buy a tent and cooker, and do it that way (assuming no
rain).

Hotels in Germany are 60DM if you're lucky, 90DM is far more typical. This
includes breakfast.

But the freedom of van-life is worth a lot: finding a hotel can take the
better part of an hour, and living in a tent is not the same as living in a
van.

You pays your money, you takes your choice; good luck.
