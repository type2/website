I have had much trouble with mac's also.  Just the other day I was using 
a mac and I froze up on me for now apparent reason.  So then I had to 
reboot the computer because the control, alt, delete doesn't work on 
mac's.  Finally after I rebooted the computer my tranny goes out.  So I 
take it to the shop and they said that I needed to put oil in my brake 
lines and that I also had an air bubble in my gas line.  He told me to 
bleed the air out of my gas line and that should take care of the problem.
Just kidding.  It's friday!!!
