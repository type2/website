Subject: Re: Why adjust valves? 

&gt;And now I say:
&gt;Robert: So what I understood from your note is that you normally
&gt;       have to change all the valves each time you adjust them,
&gt;     I also assume that they have all drifted about the same amount.
&gt;    If this is true, this would indicate some sort of wear mechanism.
&gt;   The 'slipping' case would infer that most valves would be fine, but a few
&gt;  would require adjustment, and the adjustment required could be very
&gt; different valve to valve.

&gt; Could the list memebers who have done this often comment on which of the above
&gt;cases they would say is the norm?

Looking over my maintainence log for the last 60k miles (1600cc stock single
port) my experience has been that every once in a while (every 6-9,000 miles
or so) a valve or two might seem a little tighter or looser (not
drastically, though), but for most of my 3,000 mile checks, none needed
adjustment. I never go beyond 3k without a check.  I believe it's possible
to have a valve start off as slightly tight and ignoring for 6k miles could
cause valve burn problems.  

As Joel mentioned earlier with reference to regular oil checks, checking
valves regularly does help with preventative maintainance and I have found
problems that could've accelerated into something bad without the 3k mile
check.  For example, I bought some new aftermarket pushrods from a local
FLAPS when I had my heads rebuilt and after a few thousand miles one of
those pushrods (which looked pretty much like your standard VW issue
aluminum pushrods, but felt somewhat unsettlingly &quot;cheesy&quot; materials-wise)
started to bend at the tip and cause valve adjust problems.  I replaced the
&quot;new&quot; pushrods with good used VW ones and all has been well since.
