Subject: RE: ???SAN DIEGO N. CO. EUROVAN SINGLE CAB SIGHTED???


&gt; I was driving home from work this afternoon when I saw what I thought at
&gt;first was a
&gt;vanagon single cab truck. It was obvious to me as the truck came closer 
that
&gt;this was definately not a vanagon but rather a eurovan. In case anyone else
&gt;living nearby in North County has seen this beast, I spotted it in
&gt;unincorporated Vista near the outskirts of San Marcos


Now we know why Bob Hoover has been so quiet on the list for so long...???
