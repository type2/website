Subject: Can I Install Poptop in '85?? Help

	Here is the deal, my buddy at the junk yard can get me an entire 
poptop assembly of a Westphalia off a totaled vehicle that they got for 
dirt,  dirt cheap. I have  an '85 Vanagon and am wondering if anyone has 
attempted to retro-fit one of these tops onto a non-converted Vanagon. 
While the top is from an '86 of the exact same body style, I am wondering 
whether the roof stampings are the same and whether I can just cut the 
holes and attach it or whether additional structural supports are needed 
and whether I need to take any additional hardware from the totaled 
vehicle besided the top and hinges..  Thank You for any advice you an can 
offer

&quot;..When I was in prision you came to visit me..When did we visit you when 
you were ill or in prision? The King will answer them: 'I assure you, as 
often as you did it for one of my least brothers, you did it for me'&quot;
