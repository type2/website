&gt;&gt; &quot;I'm thinking of going with 225/60-16 myself.  Higher load rating than
&gt;&gt; stock 205/70-14 reinforced.  Where can I get rims?&quot;

[snip]
&gt;Sure sounds like a good idea.

        Load ratings are NOT everything! The cross-section and rim-to-pavement
        dimensions are important in determining ride comfort and/or handling
        capabilities... Vanagons (and EVs) as well as other vehicles with a
	higher than boy-racer center of gravity combined with fully 
	independent suspension, produce dynamic lateral sidewall loads that call
	for stronger sidewalls and tire costruction which can deal with 
	the sidewall flexing. Boy-racer tire solutions are generally of
	the genre of a wide footprint and larger wheel to compensate for the
	reduced distance between rim and pavement due to the numerically
	lower aspect ratio (tire height/tire width). 

	Give some thought to the use you are going to put your vehicle to
	before going down this route...
