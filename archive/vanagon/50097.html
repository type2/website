Subject: &lt;HOW TO&gt;: blower fan replacement

Winters close enough I needed to fix the heater fan up front, in TWO vans,
grumble.  Got the '85 apart and out in less than an hour, then futzed about
for another 1.5 taking apart the fan/housing etc. only to find a severely
toasted motor, armature wiring cooked to charcoal. Checking the airbox, and
everything else showed a nice crust of fine salt deposits on all the
airways, no wonder the thing died.  As far as I can tell Bosch (the motor
folks) used steel bushings for the bearings, not bronze.  Rusted solid.
Lubrication is via (perhaps?) a felt wick.  Probably good for the first 6
months. 

        Thanks to whoever posted the note that Rabbit fans drop right in, as
indeed they do!! Uses 1977-84 years fans.  FYI removal from Rabbit/Jetta is
mostly from under the hood, except for one screw.  Four 8mm head screws hold
the heater console to the firewall, use a 1/4&quot; drive socket, not much space.
They are at each corner of the heater.  One Phillips screw holds the blower
into the console, pull off the resistor (and keep it) then unscrew.  One
last screw is under dash, at centre of vehicle, Phillips head.  Then simply
push the console down an inch or so and rotate/slide the blower out after
unplugging the two leads. Takes &lt;5 mins.

        Now, who can tell me why the fan in my '82 Rabbit is just fine,
while those in the '85 and '87 vanagons are DOA? Oh, I oiled the motor
bearings before putting in the Rabbit fan.  One end is open/easy.  The other
end is under the fan hub.  Taking that apart may hurt the motor/fan so I
drilled a hole just big enough for the extension tube from WD-40 to fit, and
pumped sewing machine oil down it, right to the bearing. Small enough hole
not to unbalance the fan.  Those of you looking for the fan control resistor
will find it thoughtfully inside the airbox BTW, just in case you're looking
for it.

        Another note, DPO had torn out fan switch (and the cover plate too)
and wired '3' through a toggle switch drilled into the lower dash.  Got rid
of that but was testing fan at speeds by holding wires together in thumb and
finger.  No probs on 1 or 2, but holding it for 3 burnt my fingers.  The
feed wire got REALLY hot really fast!!!  Couldn't believe it, checked Bently
to see if DPO had picked up the wrong lead, nope, right colour, right diam,
HEY!  For some unknown reason VW has run a thin 1.0mm wire to the switch and
thicker 1.5mm wires out to each speed.  I'd have to say that the factory
wiring is way inadequate to handle '3' setting.  Wonder if that's true for
the switch!?  Anyhow, traced back feed wire and swapped in a heavier piece.
No heat anymore.  Now to find a new switch/panel.  So seriously folks, don't
use position '3' on the dial, except very briefly.
I'll post once I've done the '87 in case this has been fixed in later years.

        Also fixed the broken heat control cable.  Rebent the broken end
with needle nosed pliers to fit into handle again.  Adjusted cable sheath
position in clamp, and voila, controllable heat once again, for nada $$!
Need to pickup a new antenna in the AM, tunes again soon. Will reinstall
dash then.  I'd say 2 or 3 hours would cover this job if you did it as
quickly as possible, everything at hand.  I needed a Phillips bit on a 3/8&quot;
extension to reach/crack the screws that hold the airbox to the front tin. I
spent some extra time wiping out the front tin and airbox, and rust spraying
it thoroughly, VW charge for 4 hours, $240 and want another $250 for the
blower, plus taxes, just under $600 total if VW got at it.  Time to go
wabbit hunting...hahahahaha.

bye, tim
