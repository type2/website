Subject: Re: Copy of: Bench seats for the front


&gt;Believe it or not, there was also a 12 pass. model called the &quot;12 seat 
minibus&quot;

Where do you want to place the 3 additional seats? On the engine's 
compartment?
I think this only usable for kids.

&gt;and bore the &quot;BUS&quot; logo on the rear hatch.

The 'Bus' logo you will find on nearly every German Transporter equipped 
with
windows. The so called Kombis have no side lids and back seats to be removed
to use the Van as a transporter. But we have no 'Kombi' logo. What I have is
a 'Camper' logo on the rear hatch. But I'm sure this is an after market.

&gt;So, yes, VW did oficially call the
&gt;Vanagon a &quot;BUS&quot; in some countries.(Britian &amp; South Africa and some others) 
The
&gt;12 pass. was exempt from the &quot;car tax&quot; in Britian, the country from which I 
have
&gt;the dealer brochure that shows this model.

I never heard about 12 seater, do you have more information?

&gt;Anybody out there have a 12 pass. Vanagon?

In Finland you will find a lot of luxury Eurovans used as taxis. They have 
jet
style seats for at least 9 passengers. Very nice to have if you have a big 
family.
