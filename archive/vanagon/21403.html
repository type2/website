Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?=BFHOw?= to clean WHITE on =?iso-8859-1?Q?POPtop=BF=3F=21?=

Hello,
I would *REALLY* like to get the poptop shite again. Tried: Soft scrub with
bleach, SOS pads, Fibreglass boat cleaner, et al=8A  But it still looks grey=
..
I believe the dirt is at a mircroscopic level. Any Suggestions?

Thanks

Louise
