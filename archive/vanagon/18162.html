Bill,

The stainless steel brake lines I mentioned are indeed stainless steel brake
lines.  If I meant to say hoses I would have said hoses.  Since a rusty brake
line does not heat itself, Terry may wish to considering using stainless
steel lines as a replacement.

Since silicone is not hygroscopic your chances of collecting moisture are
slight.  I've been running silicone in my 65 bus for about seven years.
