Subject: Re: Just how purple is &quot;Her Majesty?&quot; (was Something Positive...)

&gt;open to suggestions. I thought about calling her a foreign translation
&gt;of purple - but so far Tsi - chinese - and the Japanese...which was
&gt;misamura - or something like that  - haven't set well with me... The
&gt;upholsterer who did the Victorian Italian tapestry interior said
&gt;sitting in her was like being in the Ritz - so he thought of Ritzy. And
&gt;Carlton is a guy's name! And Blanchard, who albiet younger than I, the
&gt;only true hippie in the family,  thought of Purple Haze... A little too
&gt;obvious! Then there came the suggestion of Violet....  &quot;Her Majesty&quot;
&gt;surfaced only a couple days ago - and I'm starting to like it. Whatever

        Wait a minute... If it's gonna be a foreign translation of purple,
it would *have* to be either &quot;ilia&quot; or &quot;violett&quot; (German for light &amp; dark
purple). Granted, &quot;violett&quot; seems a little obvious. How about &quot;Violetta&quot;
(as in the heroine of Verdi's &quot;La Traviata&quot;)?

Peace,
