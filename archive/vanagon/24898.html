&gt;&gt; As some of you know I have been looking for a front  axle beem for 
&gt;&gt; some time. I have had NO luck in finding a '72 but have come across a 
&gt;&gt; few '74s. Will they work? I would like to be driving this weekend.  
&gt;&gt; any info would be greatly apreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Based upon studies a few years back, I'm pretty sure it would work.  The 
&gt;big change came in 71 with the upper bolt mounts becoming spaced 
&gt;wider, about 4 cm.

What you will have to consider if you do a straight remove the '72 beam
assembly and install the '74 assembly is brakes.  They were change for the
'73 model year, made bigger, so if you do this and work on or have work done
to them, you will be doing '74 brakes and not '72.  If you want to keep the
'72 brakes (a two year, '71 &amp; '72, only item) you will need to change the
spindles.  I would keep the '74 brakes.  They are easier to find, as you
found out, and they are a little less expensive.  I thought about doing the
switch on the Westy when I bought the '73 parts bus, but didn't bother with
it.

Hope this helps! :-)
