Subject: FW: 1987 Vanagon Question



Wow a 169K? Original motor with no major work?  I feel a lot more 
comfortable.  I thought these motors were designed to self destruct at 100K. 
 I was told VW recalled these vans for a head retorquing, probably because 
of the head problems.  Did you take advantage of this, and would this help 
the situation any?

I was told the exhaust systems for these is a trunk load of parts and are 
priced as if they are gold plated.  Is that what is lurking behind the 
sinister HEH HEH?

Sorry about keeping my response off the list.  In MS Mail the &quot;reply&quot; button 
fires the message off to the original sender, not the list.  That's what 
happens when you let the computer do the thinking for you.

Thanks
Pete
