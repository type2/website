Subject: Pla-Cool Air Cooler?

My 71 semi-camperized bus has, among other accessories installed by an
unknown PO, a unit called a Pla-Cool that sticks up out of the otherwise
stock roof. It's a white, rounded, heavy-duty plastic sort of cowling
affair, about 6&quot; tall and maybe a foot square. I think it might be a
circulating water air-cooler, but I really have no clue.

Controls are mounted on the bottom half of the unit, which protrudes
downwards from the bus ceiling. It has on/off switches for &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;pump&quot;
and another switch that flips it from &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;exhaust.&quot;

It sat unused for years until one day I noticed, tucked back in right rear
corner of the engine compt. above the battery, an empty fuse holder. I
popped a 15 amp fuse in, went into the bus and turned the Pla-Cool on, and
the fan began to whirr. Paranoid of a possible VW electrical debacle, I
turned it off, took the fuse out and haven't touched it since. 

But I'm curious. Anyone have experience with these things? Does it circulate
water (that intriguing &quot;pump&quot; switch)? If so, where do you put the water in?
What amp fuse should it take? Would I be inviting disaster to use it?

Thanks for any knowledge or even speculation.
