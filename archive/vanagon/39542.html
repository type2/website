&gt;My real question:  Does anyone have any ideas about what would leak this
&gt;much fuel?  I has not leaked since I had it towed home.  I only seems to
&gt;leak when the fuel pump is on.  The leak seems to be coming from the right
&gt;front (FIF) of the engine.  The leak seems to have poured on the exhaust
&gt;pipe even with right edge of the license plate.  Anybody have any good
&gt;ideas where to start.  Oh, I also replaced the fuel pump last weekend.
&gt;Perhaps the increased fuel pressure burst a weak fuel line.
&gt;
&gt;

In addition to the hoses, check those stupid plastic maniflods that attach to
the injectors.  The ends are sealed with a plug and o'ring which is secured
by that metal crimped on collar.  The collar has a tendancy to rust and allow
the cap plug to lossen or fall out.  This part must be checked often,
especially in salt country.  I've seen many a vanagon burn from this.
 Personally, I think we are talking recall here.
Dennis.  

BTW,  Leaky diaphram in pressure regulator will cause intake manifold and
engine to fill with fuel.   I've also seen defective computer open all
injectors and fill engine with fuel also.  Check these out too.
