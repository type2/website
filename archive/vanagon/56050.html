&gt;       I had the same problem. Turned out that I had a bad tire.

&gt;       worse.  Put the van up on a lift and run the motor in
&gt;       gear. Watch the tires for a broken belt.

Well, I replaced the front diff, and now I have four wheel drive. I also 
have an extra diff with a toasted Viscous coupling. 

The vibration is still there. It starts in at 45mph (real bad) and then 
evens out at 55mph becoming a high freaquency vibration. You really 
think it's a tire. I had it on a lift before all this, and the guys that 
checked it out mentioned that I had 3 bent wheels. I hope this is the 
end of all this. I have spent about $1000.00 on all this so far.

If I do need wheels, (I followed all the discussions on the allow 
wheel symposium) should I just get the ones that the tire rack has 
(borbett replica's) Or should I just get the stock steel wheels. (I 
assume that the stocs probably cost between $60-$80, and the alloy 
borbets come in at $110)?

Thanks. 

Desperate in N.Y with the Sincro from hell!
