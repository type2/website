Subject: Puyallup/going to Vancouver Isl/66 update

hi everyone

my computer was on the blink, and i havent been able to check mt email for
about a week

been busy with preparing for the swap at Puyallup, which was great.  met a
lot of neat folks and unloaded a bunch of vws bits (more room in the garage!)
    looks like i'll be headed up to Vancouver island in a week and a half to
help a friend trade her fastback for a bug, and check out a 54 barndoor that
someone cut in two years agowith the idea of shortening it, but never
finished.
                                             AAAACK!      bad bus owner  bad!

there is so much in the mailbox  i am truly amazed.  you continue to astound
me

BTW  the funny noise from the 66 i drove to California,  the source has been
revealed. ( it happened whenever i stepped on the clutch)  The throw out
bearing was throwing up.

ta for now

clara
