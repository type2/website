Just had to throw this in:  Minutes ago I walked past a Subaru 
dealership.  They had a big display in the window about some new 
model, I forget which.  It has a 3.3 liter six that puts out 230hp at 
4,000 rpm, torque was something like 224.  Just injected, no turbos.  
It had a six coil ignition system, at least that is what I got from 
the poster.  I should have walked in and started asking annoying 
questions.  I wonder how big that engine is?  hmmmmm

Jim (1.6 liters and holding)
