Subject: Re: Dist Driveshaft Installation ?

&gt;| If your engine is at TDC, and ...
&gt;| 
&gt;| if you install your distributor driveshaft 180 degrees out, can you simply
&gt;| change the placement of your spark plug wires (on the dist cap) to
&gt;| compensate for the new firing order ?  That is move the #1 plug 
&gt;| wire to what would normally be the #3 lead on the dist cap. Will/Should
&gt;| the engine run ? 

	This might cause problems if the Hall Sender unit sends one signal
per revolution of the distributor. The ecus adjust timing for each
cylinder (according to the Bentley FI manual), you would get the retard for
3 happening to 1.

You would also get the injectors possbily injecting at the wrong times if
they are grouped 1&amp;2 and 3&amp;4, but I do not remember how they are grouped. I
kind of doubt they are grouped like this, and would think they are grouped
1&amp;3 and 2&amp;4 so the pulses correspond with the opening of the valves...
Something to look into though...
