&gt;
&gt; 30K on an EV MV.  Niggling things taken care of under warranty.
&gt; Fluctuating fuel guage etc.  We may do the piston slap thing with the
&gt; dealer.  Its gutless but as many other people have mentioned what VW van
&gt; isn't.  I didn't buy it to race.  Overall we love it because of the room.

Ken and Charlotte:

I didn't buy mine to race either, but it worked pretty well climbing
mountain grades between Sacramento and Crescent City.  Blew the doors off
three mopar minis going up a hill in 4th gear (out of 5) at 60mph.  Really.
There were two of them together coming up in my rear view mirror while I
was taking it easy at 55.  When they got into the passing lane, I changed
my mind and kicked it up to 60.  Hill went on for a couple of miles.  They
never did catch up!  I thought this was kinda weird, till the wife and I
caravaned to Utah a while ago.  She has a Montero with a V-6 and a 5-speed.
On ALL the steep hills, I left her behind.  Has to be gearing and torque
(the EV has about the same, or more, torque than the 3.0L V-6 in the
spousal unit's car and is geared lower).

They are most gutless at high elevations with the AC going full bore.  Take
forever to accelerate, but always do.
