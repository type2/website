Subject: RE: Throttle cable woes


&gt;Went back to the engine
&gt;compartment, and sure enuf,the throttle cable was snapped off at the
&gt;barrel nut.
&gt;
&gt;No problem, I'll just rig it up and be on my way (having put my spare on
&gt;a couple months ago)  so I crawled under the front, and lo and behold its
&gt;broken there, too!
&gt;
&gt;If I hadn't been driving on the freeway when it broke, I would have 
suspected
&gt;sabotage!
&gt;
&gt;Anyone ever had it break on both ends at the same time before?

Not me.

But on my '69 bus in Colorado, it had a B-block 1600 SP engine with a
small crack in the case (got bigger later). It had many problems, and
developed a severe vibration to the point where it kept breaking the
throttle return spring on the carb(??). Went thru four of them before the
engine finally cracked in half... ah, the good old days...
