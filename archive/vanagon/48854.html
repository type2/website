     Richard ......
      The checks in the mail. I haven't been able to see the shirt on your
      Web page. Url fault?????.   What color is it. Maybe this batch will
      have a choice?

&gt; OK then, I am going to do another run of t-shirts. Here are the details:
&gt; 
&gt; DESIGN:
&gt;   A 5-color design featuring line drawings of the front views of all 4
&gt;   generations of busses. Across the top is the word &quot;NETVERGNU:GEN&quot;, and across
&gt; the bottom is the VANAGON_at_LENTI address ONLY. The type2 list address is NOT on
&gt; there, so please don't be disappointed when you don't see it. These are the
&gt; same shirts, with a different color scheme, that I've done before. You can see
&gt; them on my webpage, the address of which is at the end of my .sig. Many folks
&gt; who have ordered them in the past can attest to their nifty design and
&gt; durablilty.
&gt; MATERIAL:
&gt;   The shirts are printed on high quality colored t-shirts that will hold up
&gt; through years of washing and working on the bus. Usually I get Hanes Beefy T's,
&gt; or a comparable name brand quality.
&gt; PRICE:
&gt;  A basic t-shirt costs $16.00, which includes postage and handling charges.
&gt;  This is for adult sizes S,M,L, and XL
&gt;  XXL shirts are available, for an extra $2.00 They are large enough to fit
&gt; those of you requiring a XXXL, which is sadly not available.
&gt;  SHIPPING for NON-USA orders requires an additional $5.00. This is for the
&gt; additional postage required. These orders should be preferrably paid in US
&gt; cash, or an international money order, which must be in US DOLLARS.
&gt; 
&gt; ORDERING INFORMATION:
&gt;   Please follow these directions specifically to help things work smoothly.
&gt; Note also that the directions are a bit different from in the past.
&gt; INCLUDE:
&gt;  1. A check made out to Richard Palmer (or well-hidden cash)
&gt;  2. An index card with your name, address, SIZE OF SHIRT, number of shirts, and
&gt;       your e-mail address
&gt; 
&gt; ******PLEASE WRITE NEATLY!!!!!!!!!*************
&gt; 
&gt; ON THE ENVELOPE:
&gt;   Address it to:
&gt;   Richard Palmer
&gt;   121 - C Park Ave
&gt;   Raleigh, NC
&gt;          27605-1832
&gt; 
&gt; IN THE CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE, on the back side, please make a small note as to
&gt; the quantity and size of shirts ordered, such as 2 XL, or 1 S, 1 L. I am doing
&gt; this, because if I don't get enough orders, I will return all the envelopes
&gt; un-opened. Sadly, last time, I got burned, and ended up getting stuck with a
&gt; lot of additional costs because folks didn't follow through on their e-mail
&gt; confirmations. So, be advised, that if you sent e-mail promising to order a
&gt; shirt, then I shall pester you until I receive your order.
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; OK, then, get to it. THIS OFFER EXPIRES the 21st of September. That gives you
&gt; about 3 weeks to mail them, but please don't wait. I will place the order then,
&gt; so if I get your order the next day, alas, it shan't get printed.
&gt; So, if you plan to order, PLEASE DO SO NOW! The sooner the better. If I don't
&gt; start getting orders in, I will get really disappointed, and feel bad about the
&gt; whole project.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as stickers, if this goes well, then perhaps I shall do another batch of
&gt; stickers in a couple months. So, if you want stickers, buy a shirt, and help
&gt; further the sticker cause!
&gt; :)
&gt; Thanks, and Have a lovely day!
