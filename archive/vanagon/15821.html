Subject: Re: Bus Capitol of the World

     &gt;Does anyone know of a specific reason why the VW bus is so prevalent 
     &gt;among this people?
     
     It would appear that N.African/Middle Eastern type governments have a 
     thing about VW vans. They seem to use them for all their services. ie. 
     ambulance, fire, police etc.. 
     
     The same happens in Algeria. I believe that the Government there made 
     a deal with VW and bought a whole lot for the people Indeed I have a 
     rust-free bus sitting in a friends garden in Algiers, just waiting to 
     come over - but if you've seen the news about Algeria lately you know 
     why it's still in his garden and not in mine over here in the UK.
