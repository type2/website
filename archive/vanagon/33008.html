&gt;1958 BUS, pretty rough but would make a good project van for someone low 
&gt;on bucks. I don't
&gt;want to send this old soldier to the crusher! No engine but has clear 
&gt;title. Will someone have pity
&gt;and bring a trailer to Stillwater, Oklahoma. I'll even help you load it 
&gt;up! Please call 405-372-7179
