&gt;&gt; Up here in Minnesota A/C is_very_important!  You have to have some way in the

&gt;
&gt;Yes!  I actually keep my apartment at 64 degrees in the summertime!
&gt;
&gt;Suprisingly, A/C also helps to defrost windshields quicker in the 
&gt;wintertime.  Set it to pull air from inside the car instead of from 
&gt;outside and your all set!

All this talk of AC in the Cold North reminds me.  Did I read where some
cities on the Great Lakes are going to use the lakes for air conditioning
the whole downtown?  Something about using the isotherms that stay at 45
degrees year round and pumping lake water to huge heat exchangers....
