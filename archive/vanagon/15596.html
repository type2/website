&gt; Believe me I love air-cooled VW,s but a Vanagon cannot even coume close 
&gt; to a Chrysler van

But when (not IF) that Chrysler van breaks down, you're in a world of hurt
to fix it. You either pay the local shop $60/hr (or dealer $90/hr), or spend
a few weeks in your garage, cursing the idiots that designed such an
unrepairable vehicle.

For what it costs to replace the Chrysler's clutch, I can replace the entire
engine and clutch in my '71 Bus, and I don't need special tools, or three
days, to do it.

Let's see if that Chrysler van is still on the road in 25 years!
