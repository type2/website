Subject: Re: Torn Camper top

I would recommend either quick fixes with the canvas in place or a full 
replacement of the canvas with a new one (removing and installing the 
canvas is a hassle, and custom canvas work is expensive).

My &quot;quick fixes&quot; consist of buying those &quot;iron-on&quot; patches and having a 
friend iron one to the inside while you iron one on the outside (pressing 
the two irons together.) Probably won't work for a bum zipper though ...
