Subject:       Inuvik trip report update

Hi Everyone.  For those that are interested in heading north next 
summer, I have added around 57 pictures to go along with my report on 
my www page.  All pictures that are displayed are &quot; thumbnails&quot;, and 
you get a bigger picture by clicking on the individual 'nails.

My page is Netscape enhanced, so use version 1.1 or better for best 
results.

I hope that everyone can get a chance to view them.  Sorry, no VW's 
in the pictures, but plenty of pix of my old Cherokee just to show 
how dirty it got!!  

My page is at:   http://www.bcit.bc_dot_ca/~hyates/

It's in the &quot;travelling&quot; section.

Enjoy
Harry.
