Subject: oil additives (son of)


Thanks for the many good suggestions for my noisy lifter.  As was pointed 
out, I didn't mention how often I change the oil.  I change it every 3000 
miles or more often, I became super-diligent about this after hearing 
that this might free-up the lifter, unfortunatly this didn't happen.  
Also, there are 151k on the original engine, I bought it with 100k.  
Basically, I have driven it for 50k with the noise being totally 
predictable and now, suddenly, its totally sporadic.  I'll try some of 
the many suggested angles (except paying big bucks!), most notably just 
driving the vehicle.  I'll post if a significant change occurs, thanks again.
