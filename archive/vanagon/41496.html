&gt;Today while driving to class it started to rain, turned on the wipers,
&gt;and after about 5 minutes of operation they stopped.  When I got to
&gt;school I checked them out a little, and I found that when both blades
&gt;are pulled away from the window they will work, but I can stop them with
&gt;little force.  When I put one or both blades against the window they
&gt;stop.  I got in(getting wet and all) and turned the switch I could here
&gt;the motor running but no action from the arms.  This is for my 79 Westy.

Time to replace the motor.
