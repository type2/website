&gt;&gt;I have seen it snow in Yosemite in April, lightly, usaully, but late May 
&gt;&gt;would be almost sure fire nice weather. How about May 26, 27, 28. Or is 
&gt;&gt;that Memorial Day?

How about snow in August? Yes, I once drove on Tioga path in August in a rainy
(snowy up there) day. I couldn't believe it, snow in August. The next day I 
returned from Mono Lake back through the Tioga path again but it was sunny 
and hot just like summer. I had to drive at 2nd shift on sections of the Tioga 
path. Tioga path is one most beautiful mountain road in the Sierra mountains.
