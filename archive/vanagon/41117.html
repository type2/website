Subject: Re: 911 in vw

&gt;friend of mine races Porches and has a 72 911 fuel injected flat six for 
&gt;sale $1500, but I think I can get it for $1200 or $1000. So I can 
&gt;mostlikely cover most of the cost with the money from the other engine. The 
&gt;engine is fine with a little work needed my frind will do for free. I just
&gt;wonder if I can simplly swap the engines with maybe a few simple ajustments or 

You will have some major fun putting that engine in, and evenmore fun later
on when you need parts for it.  I had a 911 for 6 years; the most reliable
car I've ever owned, but also the most expensive when I did fix it.  Unless
you have long green handy, I'd shy away.
