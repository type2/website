Subject: New guy on list need feedback

Hi There,

I am very new to this list in particular and would ordinarily lurk 
for a while longer.  However, I have a trip coming up soon and could 
use some immediate advice/help.   I do have the Bentley manual but as 
most of you know, it is not nearly as good at describing repairs as 
most of the other Bentley manuals available for german cars.

I have an 85 Vanagon GL and while surfing the Web, I discovered the 
terrific sites on Vanagons.  When looking through I discovered some 
comments about coolant leaks under the rear seat resulting from the 
rear heater.  I had this occur about 2 years ago and I merely shut 
the thing off.  Since I live in Texas, I never really need the extra 
heating.  Can someone elaborate on diagnosing and fixing these leaks? 

Secondly, I have a broken cable on the defroster vent in front.  I 
have been trying to figure out how to replace this cable without 
literally taking the top dash off.  If someone could elaborate on 
this repair, I would be grateful.

Third, I am finding parts prices much more expensive here in Dallas.  
Parts for my BMW are significantly less for similar parts.  Is there 
a good aftermarket or national source for many parts?  I am aware of 
Recycled Parts in  Michigan.

Finally, I will be driving from Dallas to Milwaukee and would like 
some feedback on how the Vanagons handle in snow / ice.  Is there any 
trick to improve handling, etc?  I am a very experienced &quot;snow / ice&quot; 
driver (although most experience is on ice, what we get around here 
most often) but I can't get a feel for how mine will do with those 
conditions.  Also, should I consider blocking the radiator partially 
to improve engine temperature?

If these questions have been recent threads, feel free to just email 
me directly.  Any replies are greatly appreciated!
