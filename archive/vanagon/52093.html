Good Morning!

auto tranny I'm interested in buying. He suggested I ask the list for price
suggestions, soooooo, anybody got any? BTW, I'm looking at this now to put
into a vanagon I'm thinking of buying that has a shot auto tranny.

Thanks!

---&gt; snip &lt;---

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Is it a four speed or automatic?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Auto
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Again, any idea of the condition? I've often thought of putting an
&gt; &gt;automatic in mine, do a lot of city driving. Any idea of price? Any
&gt; &gt;opinions?
&gt; 
&gt; Should be in good shape.  Is complete with all linkages etc. Change over
is
&gt; do-able, Might take some time though.  Have you looked at Bentley?
&gt; Shipping could be expensive. Haven't a clue what it's worth. You might
post
&gt; it to V_at_L and ask.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh, and where are you located?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in northeastern Oregon.  About 160 miles northwest of Boise ID.  50
&gt; miles southeast of Pendleton, OR.  10 miles east of I-84. Town of Union,
&gt; outside of La Grande.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Jim
