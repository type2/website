Subject: Re: '84 battery dies

well, i reversed the poles on the battery in my 80 vanagon.
sparks flew and i burned up the alternator to starter wire.

the fallout was that the alternator was trashd.  Even with a new
brushpack/voltage regulator it still didnt work and the battery would go
dead, and the engine wouldnt run right with it connected.

if you did the old switcheroo, you will probably need a new alternator.
(i took mine to Auto Zone and they tested it for free, it was indeed bad.
They didnt sell the rebuilt ones, so i had to go elsewhere to find mine.
The cost was $120.00 exchange.)

good luck,

Steve
