Jamie: I had trouble passing the California emmisions test this year with
my Syncro, 86 with 185K. Gross poluter!!! I was told about a product I
believe is called &quot;Fuleon&quot;. It's in my wifes Carat so I can't check.
Bought it at Walmart for $19.95. Put it in the Syncro, drove it for a
couple of days, and almost passed. Understand I went form &quot;gross poluter&quot;
to almost passing. A month later I used it in my Carat,  90 with 135K,
and passed with flying colors first time.  Worth a try.
