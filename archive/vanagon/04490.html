&gt; I don't have any Vanagon experience, but I just bought some Kelly
&gt; Safari all terrain 850x27r14 tires for my '78 bus and am very 
&gt; happy with them.  They steer easier with 30 psi than the old tires
&gt; did at 35.  A friend at work got 40K plus out of Kellys on his 
&gt; Dodge 4x4.  The tread is quite aggressive, and I expect them to do
&gt; well in the snow this winter as well as in the desert dirt.  These
&gt; were not cheap at $85 installed, balanced, and new stems, but they]
&gt; are truck tires and quite a bit heavier duty than the regular 
&gt; passenger car tire.  They ride nice, and I can't say they are any
&gt; noisier than the worn out ones I took off the b us.

I just picked up a set of the Sears Trailhandler 195-75-14LTS 6-ply tires 
for DaBoat (gotta have good tires for the trip next May!) but I don't have 
any opinions about how they drive yet because my baby isn't feeling well
right now (still having carb troubles).  But so far, I can tell you
that the pair came to $146 and change, including tax, mounting, and a
lifetime balance.  The tread is aggressive, and the sidewalls are very
stiff.  They are also a *lot* heavier than the tires I had on there
before.  Nearly threw my back out lifting them into the car!  (Well,
not really...)
