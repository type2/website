&gt;&gt;&gt; I am also considering to tighten all head bolts to see if it can cure it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this a good idea?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;NO!!! go with the first plan, tightening the head bolts after the leak=20


I'd agree with this, on the basis of the condition of my old head gasket 
when I removed it. It was in shredded strips, only sealed by the grace of 
the aluminium/coolant crud accumulated. Tightening only disrupted this 
'seal' further by crushing the crud and remains of my gasket out of the way. 
I'd several near meltdowns as well,due to a failing water pump, so the 
gasket had seen a pretty hard life. If the gasket is newish (how old?) and 
likely intact , then tightening the bolts could help however. What does your 
friendly VW agent advise?    tim s.
