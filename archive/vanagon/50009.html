Subject: Westy rear suspension

I've had my wonderful 85 Westy for  about two months now and was 
wondering if they are supposed to really be lower in the back then 
the front. I realize that the engine is back there but as far as I 
know the shocks have never been replaced. What are the very best 
shocks to get as replacements? Will having new shocks affect the 
handling? Should I think about replacing the rest of the suspension 
system as well? I know the CV joints were replaced about a year ago. 
Also, I'm wondering about interior noise while driving,  I 
have some high pitched squeeking that occurs intermittently. I have 
put a towel between the stove top and metal plate and that has helped 
some. The drivers side door closes all the way but I still get a 
constant &quot;draft&quot; noise at freeway speeds. Thanks a lot for any 
advice!
