Subject:      Re: Battery Size??

I got my replacement battery for the 86 Westfalia from Walmart (~$48 USD).
Just look up the vehicle type on the display at the store for the
replacement model number.  It has 810 - 850 cranking amps at 32 degrees F
and 650 at 0 degrees F.  Fit in better than the Sears Diehard that was in
there - now that was a bitch to get out!
