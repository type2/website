I picked them up last night, and threw them into the UPS system
this morning, except for a few that are either being held for pickup at
my house or for which I do not have a valid shipping address.

Tonight I'll send out a specific confirmation to the recipients, with
UPS tracking numbers and a final accounting. If there is a problem, let
me know.

Tom F.
