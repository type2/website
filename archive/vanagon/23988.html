Subject: Brake Pad Seating Technique

Hi All,
Could someone please repost the info on seating vanagon brake pads?  I 
let it go by when I didn't need and now I do, as my new Checker pads are 
driving me (hoho) to distraction.  As I recall, they can be redressed and 
should be seated lightly for the first XXX miles or so.  
Thanks for you help,
Jack
