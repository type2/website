Subject: thing question


(ducking from Gerry's potential wrath) - ok, ok, I know it's not
exactly &quot;bus&quot;-related, but it IS VW related, so I'll make my
teeny, insignificant band-width-wasting post, and then hope for
some private e-mail replies.  

At the San Jose meet this weekend, I saw a VW Thing (181, Safare,
Trekker, etc.), probably either a '73, or a '74, since I believe
those were the only two years that vehicle was for sale in this
country.  I'd forgotten how much I like them, and have since
subscribed myself to the Thing mailing list, although no
messages have come thru since yesterday (vanagon.lenti they
are NOT).

Anyway, do any of you VW gurus out there have some tasty info
on them you'd like to e-mail my way?

Thanks!
