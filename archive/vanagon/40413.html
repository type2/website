AND

- no one ever asks you to drive

- your friends often ask other people about their families, but they ask you 
&quot;how's the bus?&quot;

- a commonly asked question around the holidays is &quot;well, how are you going to 
get here?&quot;

- you book a rental car for Christmas 3 months in advance, when you don't even 
have plans

- you always slow down crossing bridges, no matter what you're driving

- a concern over driving in February is not getting stuck in the snow, but 
rather the risk of frostbite

- people at work know you have a bus, but they're not sure whether or not 
you're married or have kids

Incidentally, I went to Lallapalooza last summer at Great Woods in Mansfield, 
MA and was sitting in line to park in the massive parking lots they have, when 
a guy hopped out of a VW Golf 3 cars in front of me, ran back and said &quot;Cool 
bus, do you want a VIP parking pass?&quot;  Which was very cool b/c it usually takes 
anywhere from 45 min to 2 hours to get out of an event there, and I was out in 
2 min. after the show was over.  (I also got an offer from a guy who wanted to 
paint a mural on the side, and a guy whose cousin does detail artwork for 
buses.)
