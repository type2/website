&gt;pressure in relation to oil temp (IMHO). Haynes states that oil pressure

        Bentley says &quot;On single caburator engines, the oil pressure at 2500
rpm shuld be about 42 psi with SAE 30 oil at a temp. of 158 deg. F. On dual
carb &amp; fuel injection engines, the oil pressure at 2500 rpm shuld be at
least 28 psi&quot;. As for the importance of pressure/temp. relations, I don't
know, but it sounds reasonable to me. Anybody got any info to the contrary?
