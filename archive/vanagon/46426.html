All:

I know this sort of topic gets bandied around once and a while and then gets
overlooked but it's pretty simple.  If you look at the volume of messages on
the list they're not that much greater than they used to be.  If you look at
the size, though, it's a different story.  I'm not talking about the 100K of
sh*t I got from root_at_sisna_dot_com today -- just the normal, everyday messages.

Look, if you reply to a message, don't include the entire text of the
original message.  Maybe include some relevant parts but not everything!!!
I can't count how many times I've seen a 10K message get resent with &quot;Yep,
me too.&quot; at the top!!!  Multiply that times 500-600 subscribers and it's not
hard to see why the U of M mail system pukes out!

If there's going to be a major house-cleaning of the list then there should
also be a &quot;house-cleaning&quot; of lazy mail habits.

&quot;look ma, no .sig&quot;

p.s. We could have avoided this if you guys woulda just put [T#] in your
posts like I told ya!

p.p.s.  I just want to publicly applaud Gerry's stamina in maintaining a
list of this volume.  &lt;clap clap&gt;  It's been great!
