To Kelley, re: Subaru engine

Yep, it is sacralidge (?) to put a Japanese engine in a THING, but consider
the following: a) The Subaru engine was designed around the VW engine,
(that's why it fit so well) the Japanese never have any original ideas, they
just take the very best and make some improvements and sell it back to the
original inventors. b) The Subaru engine, I am sorry to say, has much better
reliability, they usually last 150,000 miles or more, hardly ever break down,
are easier to service than a VW, C0 they have a lot more power and run as
smooth as glass.  If this engine was even european we would all be running to
get one. A Subaru powered THING really puts YOU in charge of what's going on.
 Imaging jumping out in front of a greyhound bus with 150 hp, for once you
wouldn't have to hide.

It's a shame it comes from the east, but it is one fine engine !
