In my 83.5 Westy I had my 10 CD changer mounted under the sink on the
bottom of the shelf.  The board supported it with no problem.  I was out
of sight but a real strain to try to reach it while driving. The only
problem was that my sink had a little leak and it would drip on top of
the shelf.  This really concerned me so I fixed the leak
    I got tired of doing contortions while driving at 65 mph so I moved
it up front.  Now it's mounted, facing up, against the passenger side
box which the seat sits on.  I would have put it on my seat but the
parking break lever is in the way.  In my van I have a center console
and the changer fits snuggly right beside it.  The console also makes it
harder to see form the outside.  The main reason I had it facing up is
that when it was sideways the seat wouldn't be able to rotate around.
Take a look at my homepage and you'll see what I mean by the console.
http://www.ecst.csuchico_dot_edu/~bhein/cockpit.jpg   The changer is on the
right of the console in this picture so you can't really see it.  This
position might not be that desireable because with the opening up it
allows for dust to settle on the changer.  If you leave the door open
then the dust will fall right into the changer itself.  It's up to you!
