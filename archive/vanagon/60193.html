Roy,

My name is Kenneth L. Winter. I requested the information about an 1984
camper that you reponded to this morning.  Please call so I can ask a
few question about the van. My number is 1-800-264-6757.  I will be out
of the office from 10:30am to 1:00pm  eastern time. Please  call today
for I  am going down to look at the van tonight.
