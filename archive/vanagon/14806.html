&gt;daughter. My buddy has a 911, paid $1800.00 for a clutch, and $500.00 for a
&gt;tune up on another occasion. He gets plenty of looks. I give him looks like
&gt;he's nuts. Naaah, gimme my '57 and the wife. Let them drive cake! 

I have the best of both worlds - a 911 _and_ a '56 bus!

$1800 for a clutch?  Sheesh!  Must be the ferramic, gold-plated version - 
I paid $400 for parts and $400 for labor.  And I got the parts from
Automotion (before I knew better!)
