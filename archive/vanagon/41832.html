&gt;  I'm curious to know if this version ever went into production, how many
&gt;were made over what time period, and if these interior parts might be
&gt;available somehow (outside of the US, I assume).

i have three pictures of what i think is the same van: it has license plate
'H-SE 5496' on the front and these captions to the picures:

VW Caravelle Carat: Der Top-Bus im VW-Programm hebt sich auch au:sserlich
   von den anderen Caravelle-Varianten ab.

Carat-Innrenraum: Vier Einzelsitze, Ablageschra:nkchen, Tisch und hochwertige
Verkleidungen schaffen eine noble Atmospha:re.

Standesgema:sses Extra fu:r den Carat: Eine Klimaanlage sorgt fu:r
angenehme Innentemperaturen.

these are in a chapter entitled: 1983 - Edel-Bus und Caravelle.

as best i can figure out from the german text of the chapter, it was a
&quot;program&quot; car ... based on a &quot;study&quot; done in 1979 (&quot;Traveler-Jet&quot;???).

however, there was a company named Dehler who made aftermarket conversions
that looked a lot like this on the inside (but had even MORE body styling
additions on the outside) ... very expensive (they were/are a custom yacht
building company) ... like 100,000DM each. :(

also Oettinger made some custom jobs that resembled the interior. again,
very expensive (and with a custom-built six-cylinder wasser-boxer engine
of their own (?) design).
