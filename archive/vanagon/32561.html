Subject: RE: F/ List Stickers


&gt;Now that all of us will have list stickers to identify ourselves, do
&gt;we need to come up with a secret wave and/or handshake for
&gt;when we spot each other?  I bet Martha could come up with
&gt;something interesting??


Uh... how about if we all start driving similar, unique vehicles?   :^)
