Subject: Answers about Rt. 66, et al.


Hello all:

As I've mentioned before, I hail from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 
interesting place to live and also the travel destination of many 
vacationers year-round.  

Having personally received requests from folks 
looking for info on NM and ABQ, I'd like to post some of the sights that 
can be seen while passing through Albuquerque on Historic Rt. 66 (well, 
I'm familiar with 66 from Santa Rosa to Grants, more or less).  I'd like 
this to be comprehensive, with odd sights (the giant axe-wielding 
lumberjack right above the Vietnamese restaraunt) and fine vistas (like 
atop 9-mile hill).  Naturally, I'll point out any VW-related places, both 
FLAPS/FLARS and the odd splittie sitting inside Birdland, a 
hippie/neo-hippie type place.  

Does anyone have specific information about Rt. 66 you'd like to know?  
It's just a hop(p), skip and a jump away!
