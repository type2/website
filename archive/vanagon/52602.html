Subject: Propex installation: lazy man's armchair plan

Tom, and members of the list,

I've been sharing your Propex installation vicariously.  While you've
been skinning your knuckles all I've got is paper cuts. And for this I
(we all) thank you; we are all grateful for this, Tom.

Just as an armchair mechanic, I'm sitting here in front of my log fire
in my cabin in the Great White North and planning my installation.

Here is what I'd like to do:  avoid removing the fridge; avoid
moving/removing the back seat heater; avoid removing shelves and
partitions; use 3/8 inch line and couplings (more common than 1/4 here
in Canada); have most of my couplings outside of the van for safety
sake. 

What if, I located the 3/8 inch (furnace/fridge) &quot;T&quot; under the van, by
the propane tank, right after the existing (fridge/stove) &quot;T&quot;.  Then I
could run a 3/8 inch line from the (furnace/fridge) &quot;T&quot; up to the
underside of the floor and back along the left side rocker panel. I
could cut a hole through the left frame rail, bend the line to go
through the hole, then route the line across under the van below the
floor of the back seat. I could cut a hole through the floor directly
below the furnace's 1/4 inch inlet, then  bend the line to go up through
the floor and come out under the back seat directly to the furnace. I'd
locate the 3/8 inch to 1/4 inch reducer here.

I'd like your feedback. Do you Tom, or anyone on the list, know if this
approach would  violate any laws/regulation in their state/province? 
Does anyone see any problems or have any changes/ideas to improve upon
my lazy man's armchair plan?
