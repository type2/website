So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648&quot;_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu says:
&gt; I found out very late in life how easy and cheap it is to have the edges of a
&gt; swatch of carpet bound.  The carpet store will have a couple colors, and black
&gt; is always in good taste.  Binding will make your custom-cut remnant look great,
&gt; even if your cutting looks like beavers gnawed it.  Only remaining problem is
&gt; having to buy 5x12 when you need 5x5.5.  And deciding which of the five browns
&gt; in the Vanagon interior you want to match.
&gt; B.
&gt; 

Well mine is in grey, so I don't thing the five different colors of brown
matter.
