Subject: Rusty's Camper in HotVWs, October!

Got my Vanagon into Hot VWs October, 95! There are four photos of it from
the VW Classic show! 
See page 69 top right (behind the two guys talking in front of the Ghia
convert that's in the way),
page 69 lower right corner, behind the double cab that's in the way, ( you
can almost see me standing behind the double cab. 
page 70 top of page, A clear shot of the Vanagon shown between a splittie
camper and a single cab with the canvas in place!,
and page 71 top of page behind the squareback that's in the way!
