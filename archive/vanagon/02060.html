&gt; Let's keep the interest going.  We had about 20 responses so
&gt; far, with a few new inquiries trickling in each day.  This
&gt; could be the start of something big.  Who knows, we might
&gt; end up on CNN, as PR for VWofA, in the mags, a book, a movie!
&gt; The possibilities are endless...

I only have a couple of suggestions.  First, the trip should hit as 
many brewpubs as possible.  Second, we should have at least several 
field trips to the great VW salvage yards of the nation.  Finally, if 
there is a movie I request that they get a good looking actor to play 
my part.  I will sign nothing until my lawyer first gets a look.
