I'm still sort of in the dark on this.  You mean there's some sort of 
VW-person to-do at the Puyallup?  Can you give me more details, like 
where and what time?  And is there really beer???  Intriguing.  We may 
need to resort to voice-to-voice contact on this.  Real time;  not much 
time left.  (206) 361-2857.
