&gt;  been told cat has been clogged with carbon...any way to burn it off?
&gt;  symptoms are...van runs good for a minute before loosing power. can make
&gt; averything better by turning off ignition (WHILE RUNNING) then back on.
&gt;  resetting computer to ignore sensor readings for a minute.  ive been told it

   This is a problem with the O2 sensor or the temperature sensor.
