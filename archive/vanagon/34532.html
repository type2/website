Subject: Re: Intake Questions on a '74

&gt;Yes I do.  These tubes are part of the fuel Vapor revory system.  They 
&gt;conect
&gt;from the top of the Gas Tank and lead back to the Carbon Canister at the top
&gt;of your engine compartment.  They are routed way up in the air on both sides
&gt;so that fuel can not siphpon onto a hot engine.  The carbon canister 
&gt;collects
&gt;fuel vapors when the engine is not runnig.  When the engine is running, the
&gt;combination of engine vacuum,(that valve on the air cleaner), and the 
&gt;cooling fan, send these vapors into the engine to be burned off.


Where exactly is this canister that collects the fuel?  I think I should 
take a look at it.  Once or twice I've filled the tank up, parked on a 
hill (driver's side downhill) and had gas spill out.  Not too safe, and I 
was wondering what it was that caused the spill.  The tubes look pretty 
good, but I'd like to check out the canister.  Is it a difficult repair?  
Everything else on the bus is in original condition, and I don't think 
the PO would have tampered with this system, but maybe someone did.

Thanks,
Craig
