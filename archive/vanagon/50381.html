OK Folks, a little caveat emptor, don't forget this ad is from a commercial
vanagon dealer, treat accordingly.  Tim Smith, your eyes on the list :)

Would this be the VW/ZF (OEM) factory, at $800, or the MOOG factory at $280?

deduct about $100 for this.



simply riveted a metal plate over them rather than fix them.  This and a 
&gt;cracked windshield are the only real flaws with the camper.

add $300 or more for new windshield, $35 for each cover/box.


&gt;The camper currently has 5-spoke 15&quot; aftermarket Vanagon mags that the 
&gt;previous owner purchased in Germany.  The asking price of $4250 includes 
&gt;the stock wheels and hubcaps; I would want a little extra for the chrome 
&gt;wheels, or would sell them separately.

Of course you would, add another what $500 or so for them..
