Subject: Car Talk's survey

On the Car Talk Web site (home of Click and Clack), they've got a survey
running where they're collecting info about the car you drive as well as
info about you.  These guys are fairly anti-vwbus and here's our opportunity
to skew some results.  But more interesting is that the survey also asks
lots of  personality questions with the goal of establishing some sort of
real analysis along the lines of &quot;you are what you drive&quot;.

If we all take the survey then, since the entire VW bus/van internet
community is probably on this list already, the results really become
a statement about us!  I encourage everyone to take the survey.

And, its a really fun web site (imo).
