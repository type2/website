Thanks to Tom Forhan for inspiring this idea.

All 2.1l wasserboxers have an oil/water heat exchanger neatly sandwiched 
between the oil filter and the block.  It is about 4&quot;x4&quot;by 2&quot; thick, with an 
inlet and outlet pipe, 16mm ID.  It is spliced into the coolant loop to keep 
the oil temps down.  
========================
This description matches the unit installed in my diesel in the same
configuration, between the oil filter and the block.
Harvey
