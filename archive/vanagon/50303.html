RE:	Copy of: Buses FS (CT/MA/NY Area)

I see those people with the &quot;'81 Carat&quot; still did'nt sell it yet. Maybe if it
was a '91 Carat, they'd have better luck!   Or maybe if it was an '87 with a
5spd!  (yeah, I know-it's the same phone # as the '91)

 just humoring, can't wait 'till friday......
