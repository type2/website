Subject: Re: Need Ideas for Converting Interior of Bus

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i'm gonna start converting the interior of my '74 plain jane bus into a vehicle
&gt;for some serious roadtrips this weekend. i've got a good essay by Roy Robertson
&gt;and want to look at any more that may be able to help me. is there a ftp site
&gt;somewhere i can download some plans, ideas, etc?
&gt;
&gt;projects may include: building bed frame, installing cabinents, gas heater,
&gt;etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;any help would be appreciated!

My advice would be to find a camper in rough condition and put the interior 
from it into yours. The interior from any bubble window 68-79 should work. I 
bought an interior from a friends '71 Westy once and put in my '73 Station 
Wagon. Everything bolted directly in with no modifications.

On that note, I have a 1969 Campmobile (cheap imitation Westy) that I 
promised a guy who has never come and picked it up. If he doesn't claim it 
in the next 2 weeks, it's going away. If you'd like the interior, you can 
have it. It has a bed, cabinets, sink, icebox, curtains, etc. The only catch 
is, you have to take the whole beast. It's not really in that bad of shape 
bodywise. And it's free!
