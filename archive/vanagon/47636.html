&gt;   I offer this speculative response to observations that FRAM oil filters 
&gt; used in Vanagons result in lower oil pressures:  Lower particulate 
&gt; threshold passing media combined with lower total media surface area.
&gt;   In particulate passage tests, FRAM has shown up as a top performer for 
&gt; years.  This indicates to me that they have elected to use a finer pass 
&gt; media than most competitors.  As to whether the cost per unit area of 
&gt; this is higher than coarser media, I don't know that either.  But I did 
&gt; find it interesting to see a FLAPS point of sale product demonstration 
&gt; supplied by WIX, who's product box seems to claim WIX is an Original 
&gt; Product Manufacturer for quite a few others marketed labels.  The demo 
&gt; consisted of a FRAM and WIX oil filter apparently from identical 
&gt; application specifications.  Each was cut around its circumference to 
&gt; allow easy inspection of its media.  Just guessing based on what I saw, 
&gt; I'd think the accordion folded media had about twice the unfolded surface 
&gt; area in the WIX compared to the FRAM.
&gt;   There are so many assumptions integrated into this speculation that I 
&gt; offer it only as a first conjectural comment.  I could be completely 
&gt; wrong.  If someone knows of a person who wouldn't bias their comments to 
&gt; favor a company's economic interests, and who could address this anomaly 
&gt; well, please do a little arm twisting to get their explanation posted as 
&gt; to why the ordinarily considered excellent Fram product apparently 
&gt; performs so poorly in Vanagons.
&gt;    
Add to this all other w/c VWs - I've recorded lower oil pressures 
with FRAM in: 85 diesel, 82 1.7l, 89 16v 1.8l, 88 turbo diesel. In 
all these cases, a VW filter resulted in improved hot oil pressure of 
5-10 psi using 20w50.
