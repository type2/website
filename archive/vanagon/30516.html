If the starter is turning over at all it's probably not starter/solenoid 
related.  Several people have been relating the problems they're having 
starting f.i. vans with batteries that are low, voltage wise.  Maybe the 
thing to try is to hook up a known fresh battery to the system, bypassing 
the existing battery, and see what happens.  If your battery is 
borderline then the cold weather may be pulling it down to a point where 
the electronics/injectors/etc. are not firing properly.

It's something to try, anyway.  Let the list know if you're still having 
problems.
