&gt;Has anyone tried just measuring the static radius of the tire when
&gt;inflated this way? It would seem to me that taking an average of 3-4
&gt;measurements on each tire, from ground to edge of rim, or centre of
&gt;axle, would indicate how close the front/rear radii are...

the way i was always told to use in measuring the circumference of a tire
(which would give you the radius/diameter easily) is to:
- mark some spot on the side of the tire with masking tape.
- put that taped spot next to the ground.
- mark the spot on the ground (with a rock or something. best way would be
  to do this in a mall parking lot, off way back in the corner somewhere,
  where no one parks, and mark the pavement with some more masking tape)
- now drive a straight line forward, slowly. counting each time the tape
  on the tire goes around and meets the ground again. count ten times and
  stop (with the taped spot on the tire again next to the ground).
- mark THAT spot on the ground/pavement.
- now measure the distance between the two spots on the ground/pavement
  and divide by ten.

yeah, i know: it ain't &quot;elegant&quot; and it's a bitch in the rain. but it works!
