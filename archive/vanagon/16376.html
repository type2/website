Subject: Tranny bearing

Hi.. my $0.02 on the main bearings,
         They probably cost way less than $100 per, phone your dealer. The 
real price, from a bearing supplier, will likely be 25%-40% of VWoA price, 
but you need the bearing #'s in hand. FAG found me a bearing for the tranny 
in a '66 Porsche, long since off the books at any supplier. I called their 
headquarters here in Canada where they will do searches for you almost as a 
challenge. I got my bearing, FAG list $82Cdn, my price $21, Porsche 
aftermarket Automotion or Stoddards $120US.
        The Porsche growled its guts out when I let out the clutch, RPMs 
dropped 200 off idle. Really horrible, I envisioned fragments of metal 
jamming the tranny at high speed and destroying everything else and me. When 
I got the bearing out the balls were clean and shiny and only one side of 
the bearing race showed minor uniform pitting. It would have run on, BUT, 
ball bearings can fragment rapidly/spontaneously so changing it was the only 
thing.
         I'll bet it's labour you're paying the most for, but getting the 
bearing yourself will save some $$. If you can drop the trans yourself this 
will save $$$ also. Good time to replace the drive shaft seal too if needed. 
Derek Drew mentioned Weddle Eng. in LongBeach CA, (310)598-2731. I'd get a 
rough quote from him for the rebuild costs. It may pay to ship it there as 
he seems to be a Syncro specialist.      tim s.

and.... you can drain the tranny oil without dropping the skid plate, might 
be worth it, won't change the noise, will get rid of the particles.

and.... keep us posted!
