&gt;Don't know if anyone is interested, and I know it's only partially about
&gt;vanagons/EV's, but I saw 4 &quot;New Beetle&quot;'s last friday morning at
&gt;approximately 8am on I-10 between Van Horn and El Paso Texas.  They were
&gt;in two groups of two, each accompanied by brand new 98 Eurovans.  My
&gt;brother, the bug nut, about had a stroke and wanted to turn around and
&gt;chase them.  But alas, we had places to go.  I had heard that they were
&gt;in Arizona road testing them, but this is as far east as I have seen
&gt;them come.  Anyway, just thought ya'll might be interested.
