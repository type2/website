I sleep downstairs and smoke my head every morning.  Slow learner.  BTW,
downstairs is the most comfortable place for those of us who are
&quot;vertically-enhanced&quot;, since we can hang our feet off the end of the
bed.  That's why we sleep with our heads to the rear--so we don't have to
hang our HEADS off the bed (crick!).
