Hi, 
I=B9m a newbie to the list, having just purchased a 91 Vanagon GL =
Westfalia Camper after wanting one for years. I love it and can=B9t =
stop grinning when I drive it. I even wave to other VW Transporter =
owners when I see them on the road! (Is this OK?)

This list and the web sites I have seen so far on Vws and Westies are =
great.  I have a few questions for the list, but apologize if they =
are repeats. If there is a FAQ or archive or Website that addresses =
them, please let me know. 

1. My 91 Vanagon has 90,000 miles  and no rust.  The VW mechanic who =
checked it out for me said there is no sign of the head gasket =
problems I have read about. Somewhere I have read that keeping the =
engine from overheating may help prevent the head gasket problems. Is =
that true? Is there anything I can do to keep head gasket problems =
from happening? 

2. On my other car (the daily driver, an 89 Acura Integra), I just =
had new struts installed. The mechanic there (not a VW expert)  said =
he=B9d once had a Vanagon but sold his because it needed a new =
exhaust system. He said the exhaust systems including mufflers for =
the Vanagon cost  around $3000, because they are stainless steel. Is =
that price right? 

3. Being mechanically inept (and navigationally challenged, but =
that=B9s another story), I plan to try for preventive maintenance to =
keep the Vanagon in the best possible shape. Are there any good =
websites or sources that have information for the mechanically =
impaired on what to do to keep the Vanagon in top shape? This one is =
in mint condition and I want to keep it that way if I possibly can.

4. The same mechanic who said the exhaust systems were so expensive, =
also said the rear-wheel drive Vanagons handle fine in snow and ice, =
and especially with studded snow tires. Does anyone have experience =
with them in New England snow and ice? Should I get studded snow =
tires? It has been ages since I drove a rear-wheel drive car in the =
winter. Any tips greatly appreciated.  

Forgive me if you have covered all these questions a zillion times =
before.    I am so happy to finally have a Westy after wanting one =
for as long as all my friends can remember. I couldn=B9t resist =
asking the experts on the list what to do for it.  

When I saw my Westy at the previous owner=B9s home, I fell in love at =
first sight. From the postings to this list, I suspect the feeling =
will stay with me for a lifetime. 

Look forward to hearing from you.
