The problem with a creeper is that it subtracts from the clearance you have to
work on the vehicle.  Thus without a creeper you probably don't have to jack
up the car, with the creeper you loose 2 -3 &quot; or more.  My solution, and
really cheap is take a cardboard box about 12-18&quot; on each dimension, with
flaps, cut it along a corner seam and open it flat.  You wind up with a piece
of cardboard 4 to 6 feet long and 2' wide.  It :
o  Is  Cheap
o  Is Disposable
o  Provides a smooth surface that you can readily slid on to get under/out
from the car
o  Provides some padding from hard surfaces
o  Provides some insulation from cold floors
o  Is recyclable and biodegradable
o  Folds flat for storage if you re-use it
o  Is a first stage emergency blotter if you spill some oil on it or nearby
