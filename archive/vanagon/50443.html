Subject: Oil drain plug

Hi,

It seems that there is two lenght of the oil drain plug. The original
one was said to be unsable by a dealer (on a Westy 85), he put a
spark plug in place in the beginning of summer saying to me that the
plug is no more usable.

Last week I show the problem to another mecanic, asking him to put an
helicoil if necessary, and after close looking found that a new
longer drain plug is ok. It seems that there is two lenght for this
plug in VW parts catalog.

Ouf! :-)
