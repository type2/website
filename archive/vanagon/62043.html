Subject: I Need a Syncro Drive shaft!

Hey, all-
I just blew my front right outer CV joint and need to get a replacement shaft
or outer joint, quick! I promised my wife we would go to the beach one of
these weekends, and the idea of having to go in a cramped Scirocco instead of
the Syncro that I can drive on the beach untill we reach the best fishing
spot, just has my shorts all in a knot. (and I just got a new reel for my
birthday!) So, a number of places I called including Rapid Parts but they
don't know anything till monday , and Parts Place, they can get the shaft
rebuilt but it will take more than a week. Bah. Any one have a spare, used in
good shape, new, whatever, that they would be willing to part with for not
too much?
Thanks.
