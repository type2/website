Subject:  6v flasher relay ??
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 95 10:02:52 PST

If the flasher relay is a bi-metallic (read current-&gt;heat) electromechanical
type it will survive fine but the flash rate will be higher than the 12VDC type.

If it is a semiconductor type it may make it as the individual components
are probably rated at 150% tolerance.  Once again the voltage/time 
characteristics will be higgledypiggeldy but it should flash.

&quot;One experiment is worth a passel of informened, educated, scientific wild-ass
guesses&quot;

Try it, lemme know.

Takes a &quot;EE&quot; to make a DWEEB.
