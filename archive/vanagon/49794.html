&gt;&gt;       In a matter of time your Vanagon will quit dead! Platinum plugs
&gt;&gt;       cause, (only in the Vanagon) the coil to over heat and finally
&gt;&gt;       quit!

&gt;Interesting! Has anyone else had this problem? Our 85 has had them for
&gt;about 6 months.

I have run them for 9 years and granted I did have to replace my coil,
but not due to the plugs. The ceramic tower of the coil broke down and
started letting the high tension short out to the body of the van. I
have had no other problems with my plugs or coil.
