Subject: ooooooooohhhhhhhhkay.........

I picked up the second Late Bus today.

I do believe her name is Mary Margaret.  Mainly because I said NUMEROUS
&quot;Hail Mary's&quot; on the trip home.

Her steering is loooose so speeds of 40+ go to be VERY exciting as we
wandered over the road.

I checked the compression:

100
120
115
115

However, the plugs were not too nice.  Fouled black on most.

I did not notice any oil leaks (well any significant ones) and it was
relatively cool after running it for about an hour at 30-40 mph.  It sounds
smooth and I was generally pleased.  However.........

I got it home and parked it and it proceeded to dump about a 1/2 pint of
oil in a pool on the ground.  It then slowed to just a drip and then pretty
much stopped.

Any suggestions?  Please tell me it is not engine killing as that was the
main reason for getting this.
