Subject: Re: Front turn lenses '72 bus

James,

The turn signals on the Aussie buses were the same. The big difference 
here was that we didn't get the 1700 pancake motor until '73. I believe, 
from this list and St Muir, that the '72 in the States had the pancake motor.

I've got a '72 with an upright motor that was originally a 1600.

The bumpers changed also over these years. The '73 had the square bumper 
while the '72 still had the rounded bumper. But the '72 was different from 
the '71 in that the chassis mounts were 1 or 2 inches further apart 
(can't remember exactly).
 
Therefore, a '71 bumper (and tow bar), don't fit on a '72. I know, 'cos 
I've tried. It's hard to get '72 bumpers from wreckers. I been trying and 
I take a tape measure.
