Subject: Re: Ooh, Ooh, manual!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some of you have turned to talk of swapping manuals and I'm
&gt;&gt; interested in getting an owner's manual ...

OK, since we're into manual labor, I don't have anything to swap (unless
you want a dead OE radio from the 79 or 3 tires with a lot of tread but
which don't have good traction) but I've been looking for a long time for a
manual for my 68.  Even the folks that advertise auto literature haven't
had any.  So if anybody out there has one they'd be willing willing to sell
or one to photocopy let me know.  I'll gladly pay copy, postage, etc.
charges.

Thanks.
