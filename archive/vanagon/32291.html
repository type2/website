Hello again Syncronauts,

I posted this message about 10 days ago and we're now ready for
orders.  The cost came out to be $12.00 each sticker.  If you haven't
responded yet and are interested, please e-mail me by 1-11-96

&gt; Has anyone else with a dark colored Syncro checked into
&gt; getting the &quot;Syncro&quot; and/or &quot;4WD&quot; vinyl insignia from VW ?
&gt; 
&gt; What I've found out is they only come in two variations -  Titan
&gt; Silver, dark and Titan Silver, bright.  The VW dealer and I haven't
&gt; figured out what the difference is between these two because they
&gt; are both the same silver color  which is so close to Wolfram Grey
&gt; that it hardly stands out on my '87 Syncro.  They cost around $22
&gt; each from VW and I need two &quot;4WD&quot; and one &quot;Syncro&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Since I can't get insignia that stands out against my '87 Wolfram
&gt; grey Syncro I'm getting a price from a second cousin of mine to
&gt; make these insignia.  We're scanning the insignia into his Gerber
&gt; System and we will be able to reproduce them in any color and
&gt; any scale.  The insignia that's being scanned are ones that I bought
&gt; from VW.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll take orders from anyone else that needs or wants a different
&gt; scale of these insignia.  Just let me know what color and whether
&gt; you want the standard size or a scaled size and I let you know how
&gt; much they cost.  I'm having mine cut into a bright silver metalic 3M
&gt; eight year outdoor vinyl.
