Subject: LiMBO Rites of Spring at Carlisle May 9th -11th

Hi Volks,
   I just wanted to remind everyone that LiMBO is having a get together
at the Carlisle Import festival May 9th -11th.  Nothing fancy, just a
good time and camping. I'm not sure if this rate is standard or special
for LiMBO Members but I think its 20 dollars to camp for the weekend
there may also be an addmission fee. If your going to be there, stop by
the LIMBO tent and say Hi. We are hoping to set aside a spot on the show
field for our buses.  Wouldn't that be cool. Hope to see you there. Take
care.
