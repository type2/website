Don't ask me where I have been - I don't really know myself ...   :)  This
is an official delurk after an *age* of inactivity.

&gt;Subject: Eurovan Gauge strangeness
&gt;
&gt;In the archives I notices some posts concerning Problems with the fuel 
&gt;and the temp gauges, sounded like a short or ground fault.  I have 
&gt;noticed this beginning to happen on mine.  
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone solved this?  Or eliminated potential sources?
&gt;All help needed and appreciated!

Since my last post (last AUGUST!!!) I am the happy owner of ANOTHER '91 T4.
Same year, same colour, same engine size, in fact - I traded 91CE1420 for
91CE2091.  Heh.  I moved up 600 numbers.

The reason was the engine on the original blue thing expiring, thanks to the
faulty temp gauge.  Since I bought the vehicle, blue thing's fuel and temp
gauges worked for a total of 2 minutes every week.  (!)  So I overheated a
couple of times without knowing and blew the block.  Expensive.  :(

The *NEW* garage to which I go said that the fault is a bad and continual
fault on the actual circuit board in the gauges.  Particularly prone to this
bad design are the '91s, '92s and early '93s.  My new blue thing has had a
modification to the panel and has been workable thus far.  Of course, the
needle for the temp is miscalibrated so REALLY DAMN HOT is shown as WARM and
WARM is COLD.  Go figgur.  :)
