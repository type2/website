&gt; Call Jill Jasek, at Sierra: 800-288-7234.  She's anwered all of my

&gt; my '84 Westy, including  the flush product and the hydrometer (?) used to
&gt; test, and to date, after about about six months, I've had no evidence of
&gt; any deterioration. If you are still concerned about rust and corrosion
&gt; inhibition,  ask her for a source for comparative data and information,
&gt; which I assume she has available.

But it's NOT Phosphate Free.
