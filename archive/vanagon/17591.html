&gt; I remember an really expensive rotor for my '71 that was a centrifugal rev 
&gt; limiter also, fixed at 4200RPM i think, that or 4400. Cheap insurance, but I 

I still have the original distributor and rotor from our long gone 72 bus.
The rev limit on the rotor is 5200rpm.  My mother would test it out in 1st (25
mph), 2nd (38mph) and 3rd (63mph) gears all time.  It would bog the engine down
if the cutoff was reached.  Me, I would shift at 5000 for fast acceleration.
