Subject: Re: 82 Westfalia Carpet

I ordered a full carpet set from Rocky Mountain Motor Works (Bus Stop) 
for my '73 Sportsmobile and was extremely pleased when it arrived!  
Everything was a very good fit and the price (I thought) was 
reasonable.  I happened to order a nice medium grey, but they have many 
colors available.  It may not match your original perfectly, but RMMW 
was one of the only places I found that had this carpeting precut and 
in stock!

Usual disclaimers, just a pleased customer....
