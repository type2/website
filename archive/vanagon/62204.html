My 86 westy needed the rack replaced badly all through out the winter(in
Canada) last year, finally had it done so my wife could take a big trip
with the van.

Cost me $650.00 (Canadian) with exchange and I didn't have to put it in,
even got a 1 year warranty (in writing!), When it first started to leak I
tried all of the known sealers of power steering and auto tranny fluid, all
to no avail, one time my wife was getting the oil changed and they asked
her if she wanted to have the fluids topped up she said yes, they kept
pouring and pouring, 3 bottles of power steering fluid later when noticing
the puddle on the floor they told her she had a leak in one of the hoses!.

Fluid was leaking out from the drivers side rubber boot, upon pulling back
the boot it was clearly from the seals not doing their job.

I had heard that the wrong fluid will wreck the seals, Vw uses the CHF
brand of mineral fluid that costs about $30.00 per liter

I won't be letting the boys at walmart top up my fluids again!!!!!!

I'm hoping that the rack lasts, but if not I sure love warranties.
