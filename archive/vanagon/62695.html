Subject: What an idea!(very little vw content)

Hello Volks,
	Just got a National Geographic in the mail, found an ad for d*does mini
van. The all-wheel-drive uses an &quot;inter-axle viscous coupling the
automatically gives more torque...as needed&quot;
	A viscus coupling, what an idea! I wonder where I heard of this before?
	I really wonder why VW almost peetered out in the vans, I know the EV is
around but it's just not the same as it was. Marketing? Public acceptance?
VW service? Price? Did the public just grow out of the vw bus?
	Maybe I'm just having a bad day, but it would be nice to be able to get an
AWD van with double doors on both sides, seat 7-9 and have some storage...

Rob
