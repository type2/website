&gt; gaskets into the cooling system. Sometimes the coolant level is
&gt; (permanently) a bit _low_ (ie I've somehow lost some), yet there is no pool
&gt; of coolant under the car. So maybe it is possible that there is a 2 way
&gt; exchange going on through the head gaskets.

If you haven't already, first check that you tank cap is holding
preasure.  Easy to check, cheap to fix.
