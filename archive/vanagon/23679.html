Subject: Re: VW-Vanagon Mailing List Split?

    As to a split...... I (and my wife also) currently have 
an '85 weekender; having progressed up (?) from a '67.  I
very much enjoy ALL the commects, questions, and answers
from all years.  Sometimes I even miss the '67, except then
I remember the heater in winter.  I/we would not like a &quot;split&quot;
in the server.  I do like splits of a different sort.  I really
do miss our '67, the good ground clearance, ease of repair, 
lower cost of parts, but then, I really like the excellent 
heater,  the better performance, the better gas mileage .....
Nah, I don't want a split in the news server.
