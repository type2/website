Subject: 'net access from bodega


I plan to bring a base model mac powerbook 150 to bodega bay.  With
luck, and some clever phone manipulation by a certain member of our
group, we hope to be able to set up 'net access.  For those of you
who can telnet into your accounts, you will then of course be able to
check mail, read news, whatever.  Plus, we can give &quot;live&quot; updates
of the group campout to the list members not attending.  

I'm mentioning this all ahead of time in case there's anything you
need to bring with you in the way of numbers, addresses, etc.  Steve
Johnson, for example told me he needs to bring a special key pad
which allows him access to his account.  

If anyone has a dc powered modem they'd like to bring and try out
it will be welcome.  I've never tried out this access method before,
and don't know for sure whether my 'puter powered teleport 2400 baud
modem for the mac will work off the laptop source or not.  I'll try
and test it ahead of time, if I get a chance..
