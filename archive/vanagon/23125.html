Subject: Leaky Syncro

Howdy Volks,

Just noticed under my NTM 1987 Syncro GL that there were a couple drips (to
go with the one driving, I guess).  One is in the front (rack and pinion
unit) and the other in the rear (front of the trans where the drive shaft
attaches).  How hard is it going to be to replace these seals, if the are
replaceable?  I haven't yet come up with the bucks for a Bentley and,
unfortunately, there isn't a Haynes for the Vanagon past 1983.

Thanks to all in advance.
