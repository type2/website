Subject: oil filters

Any one use oil filters other than german made??

I just changed my oil ...the bosch filter i removed has all kinds of
springs in it...the one i installed (AC brand) none of the local parts
store filters have these spring in them...??? Just got the 86 vannagon.

	I have been using parts store filters on my diesel van with no
problems..

				thanks again Brian
