 Eurovan Owners,

                Two questions:

1. Gas guage: When it read 1/2 how many gallons are left? Is the 1/2
based on the total volume of the gas tank (21 gallons, right?) or does
it not include the red-zone reserve of 2? gallons??

2. Engine Oil dipstick: when the oil is down to the end of the crossed
section is it one quart low or more than one quart??

Any new news on the '96 EV's?? Truth or fantasy??

Cheers,

Hal Roth
