&gt;I think I've figured out why many bus(transporter) drivers don't wave
&gt;back. They need to keep one hand on the steering wheel and one hand on
&gt;the stick shift to keep it from poping out! Any attempt to wave
&gt;could prove to be fatal!


In the Great White North (yes, I lived 5 years in Meeneesoooota), they keep
one hand on the shift lever for the above-mentioned reason, scrape the ice
off the windshield with the other (while not reaching out the window with
the spray bottle to wash off the outside of the windshield), keep one foot
on the gas to keep the poorly-idling engine from conking out, and one on
the brake; and therefore they must steer with their... uh...


Maybe this explains why some VWs are so slow?
