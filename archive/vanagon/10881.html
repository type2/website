Subject: advice needed-rebuilding engine-`74 camper-part II

Part II

So I went and bought the book. It is truly a great book--a good confidence
builder.  I was simply planning to use it to help me remove the old and put
in the new.  But after looking through the section on &quot;Engine overhaul&quot;, I
was inspired.  Why not just rebuild the whole thing myself?  Buying a kit
of rebuilt or new engine parts will surely be cheaper than buying the whole
engine. I've got plenty of time, but limited money. My knowledge of cars is
very limited, but I have enlisted the help of two friends who have alot
more expereince than I.

My question is---am I being too ambitious, biting off more than I can chew?
Or is the procedure really as uncomplicated as Muir's book paints it out to
be?

Also, could anyone tell me a good place to acquire the necessary Phase II
tools?  Would these be available at any good hardware store or auto supply
store, or is it going to require a ittle more searching than that.

Thanks for any help.

Ben
