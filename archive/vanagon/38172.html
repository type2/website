Hello Dennis and List Members,
	Thank You for the information, I'll be sure to check out the rack
for up and down play.  This will be the first time I am going to see these
parts up close and personal I imagine it will take me quite a while figure
out exactly how things are supposed to work.  Reading and doing are two
different things and I want to be some one who can do.  If you have any
more tips a beginner might miss please pass them along.
	I am still waiting for the tools to come from Harbor Freight. If
they come today or tomorrow I'll try this job this weekend if not it will
have to wait for next weekend.  I am also planing on doing the shocks in
the next couple of weeks. After I have put everything back together I am
going to go get the front end inspected and an alignment.  Luckly this is
a recreational vehicle for my family and it can sit without use for a
while.
	The rack boots and tie rod end came form Bus Boys yesterday. The
rack boots were $12 a pair, made in Germany, original VW equipment.  The
tie rod end is an after market part and is a little different from the
original, it use a nylok nut instead of a nut and pin. It looks like the
tie rod end should work just fine. The tie rod end was made by I think
Remco, and cost $22.50.  I am buying the KYB gas shocks from Performance
Suspension Technology, http://www.p-s-t_dot_com/, for $119 for 4.

	Thank You.
