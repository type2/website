Subject: My engine out too...

Removed the engine from Foo ('65 deluxe)  saturday to deal with the front
transmission mount.  Originally, I was going to monkey (Muldoon) it around
with the engine in but the generator need servicing.  (It was getting very
very hot as the front bearing was going. I had to stop before and after 
driving the Mass Turnpike) and cool.- occasional watering down - so I
could make it to the garage.  So its out.  I took off one of the heads -
I had an intake valve that when I adjusted it the valve stem was slightly
below the Spring/Washer.  Everything seems ok with it though.  There's alot
of carbon buildup in the head/top of piston.  Question: What should I do to 
remove the carbon? Anything? Nothing?  Engine's got between 15000 to 20000
since rebuild.  Should I have the heads gone over since its out (Everything
was just fine before pulling the engine).  More later.....
