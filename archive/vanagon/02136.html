&gt; The '89 is bound to be pricey.  A '90 Vanagon GL (non-syncro) sells for
&gt; about $18-20K at the dealer.

Geesh, they offered me $8K for my '89 Westfalia Non-Synchro GL w/30K miles.
I gotta bust some heads. (No, I didn't sell &quot;Bert&quot;, he's my faithful steed
at the moment... I sold the Fox.)
