Well, its finally happening.  I am getting her back on the road.  Last year,
after she sat for so long, I managed to get everything running again, then the
tranny went south, so for the last year, she's just been sitting in my yard in
Boulder Creek, near Santa Cruz.  Boulder Creek got about 70 inches of rain this
year, so not only do I need to deal with the tranny, but all the dampness,
mold, moss, and mildew that has set in.

Now that the tranny swap is about done, I was wondering if anyone out there
could suggest some sources for the material and workmanship that I'll need to
get her running in time to at least tail along on GNATT for a few days (can't
get off of work to join up for the whole trip).

I am going to need some brake parts (possibly all the parts from the backing
plate out) for the replacement tranny, as it is the original one with the small
diameter stub axles, and the bad one is a later model unit.  Any sources for
these parts, whether a junk yard or other supplier in the SF Bay Area, or mail
order would be great.

I hope to do something with the engine while it is out and would like any
suggestions as to what carburetion, exhaust, and (preferably elctronic)
ingnition you folks recommend along with a good source.

I am going to need to get my split bench front seats either re-upholstered or
replaced, and some mounts for them welded in (the last owner thought cloth
Volvo seats were correct for a '64 Bus, so ground out the original mounts).    

My wife says I need to get her re-painted before she'll ride in her, so for
now, I am thinking of a cheap and quick Earl Scheib job, unless someone out
there convinces me that the cost / appearance trade-off makes it worth shelling
out more $$ (how much?) for a better job.

Any info would be sorely appreciated, and I'll be signing back in later with
progress reports or pleas for the deeply experienced knowledge base this list
represents.

Later,
terry (sick '64 Camper)

PS We are already planning to go the the Kelly Park show on Sunday, so I might
just attain enlightenment there.
