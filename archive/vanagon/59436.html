I don't know, but if anyone is interested in paying $7,900 for an 81 Westy, I
could certainly justify parting with mine, and it has a stove.

&lt;&lt;&gt;For sale 81 Westy at local vw dealer. Spoke to salesman who told 
&gt;me: Beige, 59,000 original miles, pop top with all camping except stove
&gt;(looks like it never had one). Smith VW is located in northern Delaware 
&gt;near where I live. If anyone would like more info I will try to get over 
&gt;to drive/look at it. If interested call Pat Smith at Smith VW (302)
&gt;998-0131. $7900.00 Pat says is in great condition in and out and why
&gt;would a salesman lie?&gt;&gt;
