Subject: more idiot factor
Date: Fri, 19 Jan 1996 12:47:00 -0600 (CST)

Well, I didn't know we were supposed to relate non-vw car idiot 
factors.  Way back when I was about 16 years old and my family had a 
little yellow Fiat.  I had just taken someone to somewhere and parked 
it at the top of our very steep driveway.  It was very flat on top.  I
put it in gear, didn't set the brake.  Ten minutes later the neighbor 
was pounding on our door.  The Fiat had liberated itself from it's 
resting place and fled down the driveway and across the street.  
Luckily there was a light pole between it and the neighbor's house.  
The impact dislodged the light from the pole.  It missed the car.  My 
dad got to buy the city a new light.  The pole survived.
The trunk never did open again.  I had to change the duct tape every 
couple of months to keep the water out.  Looking back I wonder why 
we were bothering to keep water out of a trunk that didn't open...
