&gt; Burroughs escaped to Northern Africa after killing his &quot;wife&quot; in a drug
&gt; induced fracas.  As far as W.S. Burroughs having a thing for Mexican
&gt; women...  He might have come closer to having a thing for Mexican men. :-).
&gt; BTW he's still alive and living in Lawrence, Kansas, where he is a tenured
&gt; professor of English at the University of Kansas.

The fracas was playing &quot;William Tell&quot;--put a glass on
someone's head and then shoot it off. . .
(&quot;Oh---you meant shoot the _glass_?&quot;)       :(
