Subject: obscure parts for my 71  :)

Hi there!!  I'm looking for some obscure parts for my newly acguired 71
camper.  
First:  sliding curtain hooks that slide into the original curtain track over
the sliding door.  (they are tiny hooks)
Also:  window crank (round, black knob) for the window for the above door
And:  Light casing for the rear liscense plate light.

And does anyone know another mailing list that specializes on air-cooled VWs
and 
does anyone know a good travelling club to belong to for cross-continent VW
bussing

 Thanks my VW friends!!    Keep on truckin'    VWgroovingly yours,  Brett S.
