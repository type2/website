I've posted a few notes on my ongoing problems witm the ignition .  I'm
wondering if there is a way to check the computer  brain for the ignition
with a volt/ohm meter? also how do install another ground harnes/strap?
what do I ground  and where. It seems like I've replaced everything in the
ignition system and checked all the electric connectors so maybe anothe
ground might work. When the engine is running it works just fine-it purrs,
but intermittently it just dies-no sputters, no hiccups, no backfires it
just dies like I've turned the key off. anyway if you could help me with
the above questions it would be appreciated.
thanks, RUDY B SANTA ROSA CA  84 WATERBOX, 80 AIRCOOLED
