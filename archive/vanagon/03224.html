&gt;&gt;Any EuroVan drivers have any horror stories? Or success stories?

&gt;Nope on the horror stories....yep on the success stories...
&gt;whats it to ya?

I second Ric's assessment; it's the most trouble-free VW I've owned yet,
and I've owned enough of 'em to know....
Somebody earlier today stated that the Eurovans were a sell-out to the
minivans and lacked character compared to the T1-2-3 Type IIs;  
wellll, that's good, you just keep thinking that, and the five or six of us
on this list will just enjoy our little secret...
Larry, Ron, Richard, what's the word from you guys?
