Subject: Parting out '81 Vanagon L

I am parting out an '81 Vanagon in Denver. The motor, trans, front turn 
signals, grille, sliding door handle have been sold to other list 
members, but almost everything else is still available. All of the parts 
are original German, fairly priced, and guaranteed. Also, I am happy to 
ship COD in the continental US.
Please E-mail if interested.
TIA,
Josh
