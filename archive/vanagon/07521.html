Subject: Re[2]: Syncro experiences?

&gt;BTW I have heard that the Synchro's get shocking fuel economy.

As a Syncro owner, I must agree. Anytime I tell someone that I own 
a 4x4 camper capable of sleeping 4 adults that gets 20 mpg on the 
highway (with the ac running!!), they are usually pretty shocked.

BTW, saw a maroon Syncro (non-Westy) the other day (86-87) that 
had big stickers running down the sides and across the front &amp; 
back that said 4x4 in this sort of high-tech looking font. Has 
anyone seen anything like this, or was it a home job?
