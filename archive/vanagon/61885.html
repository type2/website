When my 86 stuck in third gear it turned out to be a broken gear. If
memory serves me it was the 3rd/4th sliding cog. Not a lot of fun to change but I did it my self (borrowed one tool from dealer).
Good Luck

&gt;Recently the third gear in the transmission of my 84 vanagon has 
&gt;started
&gt;sticking.  It slides into gear OK although it doesn't feel as smooth

&gt;other gears.  However, sometimes, at irregular intervals, it doesn't 
&gt;want to
&gt;come out of gear and I have to fiddle with it in order to disengage.
&gt;
&gt;When the engine oil seal was changed in January, the mechanic said the
&gt;clutch was in good condition. None of the other gears are having a 
&gt;problem
&gt;-----YET!
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any information on this?  Can you reply by email as I 
&gt;am
&gt;off the newsgroup for about another month.
