So Evan Estern says:
&gt; Has anyone heard of a type of muffler called &quot;Monza&quot; or something like
&gt; that.  It's supposed to cost around $175 and be an improvement on the
&gt; original parts and easier on the engine than an extractor.   
&gt;  

I think the attraction of the &quot;Monza&quot; exhaust over the extractor was
that it gave better ground clearance (See Speedbumps)  The Monza
exhaust is just a pair of dual pipes coming out the back that are
joined under the apron with a perpendicular pipe and routed to the
exhaust manifold/heat exchangers.
