Subject: Re: snow?/f

&lt;&lt;What's with all the discourse on heaters and hot mirrors and snow
tires and
traction and what do you DO with those chains anyway???&gt;&gt;

In Florida, the chains are used to tie the van down during hurricanes.
In California, the chains are part of that &quot;drag thing&quot; they do so well.
In Canada we use them to get out of the snow and head for Florida or
California.

Coooool, Larry
