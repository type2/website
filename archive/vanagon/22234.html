&gt;I'm still not satisfied with the idle and I may even have my distributor
&gt;turned up just a hair high (it's tough to get that right with idle
&gt;problems)

It's possible to set timing quite precisely on an '71-and-earlier
bus without running the engine, and even without a Muir-style
timing light bulb.

Pull the center wire on the distributor, turn on the ignition,
and put the tranny in neutral. Go around back, put your spark plug
wrench on the generator nut, and turn the engine until the timing
marks approach the crack in the case. Tell everyone around you to
shut up, and then listen veerrrrryyy carefully for the tiny &quot;tick&quot;
the points make as they open (or is it close?). Your plug just
fired-- adjust the distibutor to put this right on the correct
location on the pulley.


&gt;BTW, if put the heel of your right foot on the brake, it is possible to
&gt;work the gas enough to keep it running...though a little pain may set in at
&gt;those longer stop lights...8-(


I stop mine with the parking brake, keeping the clutch in and
playing with the accelerator pedal to keep the engine running.
Even works on steep hills.
