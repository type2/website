Just thought that this needed clearing up, although it does use up bandwidth on
non-Bus stuff (except that both I and my bitch, Brandi have been known to favor
my Bus's tires for roadside relief).

I think that SStones meant female dogs (bitches) and he was sorely wrong.  My
Chow mix not only raises her leg to mark, but can mark higher and more
accurately than most male dogs twice her height.  This may be due to the fact
that she raised puppies on her own in the woods before arriving on our door and
needed to set aside her own territory for survival and thus learned this
method, but as any subscriber to this list should know, generalizations are
dangerous and frequently incorrect.  BTW, my male Chow mix still prefers a
slight squat to a leg lift, be he's been neutral from six months.

Now back to TII's.
