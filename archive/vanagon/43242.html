Subject: Westy RV sink water supply system

Greetings,
  When I bought my Westy, the 12VDC RV sink water supply system didn't 
work.  I checked the spigot assembly, and discovered that it includes a 
primitive on/off switch, the contacts of which may touch if the knob is 
rotated.  Bridging them caused no water flow nor audible noise, but a 
meter revealed that there was a load being engaged.  Next I located the 
tank access, located below a removable steel panel forming part of the 
bottom of the rear-most storage space just below where the rear fold-away 
table is stored.  In that tank I found the lime encrusted water pump.  
Deliming it with Lime-Away restored it's operation.
  The system worked for many cycles until the last day of my 3 day outing 
to watch the shuttle launch and other pleasant distractions.  There 
again, if someone is contemplating going to watch a shuttle launch, I can 
give some specific information so you can have a better view than I and 
my guest had at Florida's Getty State park.  This is the officially 
recomended RV viewing spot, but it's terrible.  The fed erected a huge 
mound of earth to block Russian ship view of launches, and it's in 
between the pad and the RV park!  There's a wonderful clear view 
available without cost from which preflight activities can be watched.  
But I digress.
  Now, either turning the switch on or bridging its contacts with a good 
clean clip lead set, results in a period of several seconds with no 
action but measurable load, followed by very weak water flow.  I 
speculate that I have a high resistance connection in the electrical 
path.  I'd prefer to know the best order of disassembly in this area, as 
it appears to be rather messy.  I'm going to be in that area because of 
the cycling refrigerator fan anyway, but if someone could give 
instructions first, I'd appreciate it.
  Now, even when that's corrected, I intend to alter the Westy's 
primitive sink supply design.  It's designed to flow full blast on or 
nothing.  I want to be able to regulate the flow rate.  The two obvioius 
alternatives are to control the electric power to the pump or to 
introduce an adjustable restrictive valve into the water line.
  To me, it's no contest.  I feel that regulating this little pump 
electically would be a very poor approach.  If someone wants to discuss 
the reasons, we can do that, but I'll assume others would reach the same 
conclusion here.
  Now if others have introduced a simple clean pleasing valve on/next to 
the sink, please describe just where you installed it and what valve you 
used.  I feel that it's important that whatever valve is introduced, that 
it should offer virtually turbulant free unrestricted flow at its fully 
open position.  This clearly precludes the use of many common valve 
designs.  But most good gate valves I've seen are too ugly.  This must 
work well in flow control and to the eye. 
  Hope this generates some activity by this bright group.
	Thanks much,
	John
