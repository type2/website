&gt; .- These hoses are this way for a reason! If there is a backfire or pop in 
the system, a hose can pop off instead of popping full force into the 
airflow meter, causing damage to the airbox is not good for the pocket 
book and pushing a hose back on or into it's proper place is much 
cheaper.
  
  If this happens again or pops out very easily one of the two fittings 
may need to be replaced due to age or material breakdown. 

  Many vans and buses have been towed into our shop and the only thing 
wrong was a hose had popped off. More times than not it happens upon 
starting the motor and giving gas upon startup, a well tuned and 
properly maintained FI engine should (I hate that word)startup without 
giving any gas.
