Subject: 63 bus bumper
Date: Thu, 18 May 1995 07:45:23 -0700 (PDT)

Regarding that bumper I saw for sale in the paper here in San Diego, I have
called the guy about half a dozen times and left a message, and gotten no
response.  I don't know how I managed to get through to him before, but if
I had known it would be this hard, I would have gotten more info at that
time.  Anyway, I will be leaving on GNATT in two days, so I don't think I
will have enough time to follow up on it any more - my apologies to those
who were interested.  Here is the phone # of the guy: (619) 267-3681.

p.s. Did everyone hear about the tank that was stolen from an Armory here
and driven all over town last night destroying things?  What a trip!  
Nothing like this has happened since that kid hotwired the cat and drove
it across a dealership parking lot!
