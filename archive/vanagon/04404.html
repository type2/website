Subject:      an offer...

I've thought about assembling a &quot;Maintenance FAQ&quot;. Since, I would primarily be
an end user, I'd like to get you VW gurus to help me out. Everything from what
type of oil to use for what season, fluids to replace-where and when, tools to
buy, what goes bad and should be replaced every ______(insert the time period
of your choice). I thought I might separate some info by SPLITS, BREAD LOAVES,
BRICKS, and Eurovans (do we even have a name for these yet?). Topics are up to
all, others could be &quot;replace the stock version of PART X with this heavy duty
or larger PART B from the Bits &amp; Pieces Company. Also, do we have enough
people to start a junkyard (er... auto recycling business) list for anywhere,
world? Addresses, phone numbers, years, and models in the yard would be
helpful. Also, whether it was a &quot;take the part off yerdamself&quot; place or if
they require their employees to do it info would help. &lt;--- HUHH??? Anyway,
Also maybe for the first doc, maybe a table of normal maint with timetables &amp;
parts (which type spark plugs, oil etc.) could be included. Granted, for those
of you already having much of this knowledge, this may be of limited use but
for some of us, we desperately need it. Anyway, let me know what ya think and
start your engines if interested.
