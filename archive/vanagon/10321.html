So Dave Kautz says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Cripes, we lost a '74, I may have to buy another one to stay ahead of the 
&gt;   '75s. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Now lookee here - the bus contingent needs only 7 more members to overtake
&gt;   the Vanagon contingent. That would be an interesting twist considering the
&gt;   name of the list. If all those wannabus folks do the &quot;right&quot; thing......
&gt; 

Interesting indeed!  I'm not even sure who would have the inside track!
I'm not sure, but I'd believe there are still plenty of those brick bodies
available for restoration for many years to come and they're cheap(er) to
keep.  The vanagons have their youth and spaciousness on there side, but
to maintain them, Ug!  Gotta hit those wrecking yards which are being
demised as well.    

Bottom line is, I think General, ahem, I mean Gerry Skerbitz ;p ;) just 
might have the last word about the lists name and he has a vanagon now. ;)
