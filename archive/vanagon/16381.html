&gt; Sorry about the lack of VW content, but is there a standard format for maps
&gt; sorta like gif/jpeg for pictures, mpeg for sound/video, etc?  Is there an 
&gt; on-line repository of maps?  Is there any on-line map stuff at all, even gifs?
&gt; 
&gt; When you guys were talking about Red Rock and various other trips, I'd like to
&gt; follow you guys in spirit:-)  

Don't know about a standard format, but in preparing for GNATT I spent
some time experimenting with scanning in maps.  I was able to get some
nice scans of the first page (i.e. North America) of the Rand McNally
road atlas.  I scanned it in three sections (West, Central, and East) and
then printed them and taped them together.  If you want, I could post
the scans or make them available via anonymous FTP or on the web.  I think
they are in jpeg format, but I could convert them to gif pretty easily.
They were scanned as black and white line art, so the file size wouldn't
be too big.
