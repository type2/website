Subject: Pop top front edge deformed. 3/4 inch gap to luggage rack.
Date: Tue, 27 May 97 19:57:15 EDT

Finally summer has come to NYS! Time to take the Westy out
of hibernation. While getting it ready for the summer season
I noticed that there is a new gap between the pop-top forward
edge and the luggage rack. The gap forms a (thin) new-moon
shape, forward facing opening with a maximum height of about
3/4 inch at the center. The rubber front seal is in 
good condition, but the pop-top front must be warped
near the front edge.

Has this happened to anybody else? Why does it happen?

I noticed that the pop-top latch on the underside is adjustable,
and I tried to adjust it to the lowest position. This didn't help.
(Just made it harder to close the pop top). Based on this I don't
think that the whole pop top is warped. Probably only the small section
in front of the wood and aluminum beam which the tent cloth
is attached to is bent.

Suggestions for how to fix this?

Thanks,
Martin
