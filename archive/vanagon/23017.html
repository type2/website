Subject: How High?

     I've just booked me and my camper on to an ferry for Ireland. They 
     need to know how high it is.
     Does any one know? It is a '78 with no pop-top. The hight limit is 2 
     meteres and there is only one space on the high vehicle section of the 
     ferry.
     
     Any help ASAP would be cool as I need to know today and my camper is 
     at home and i'm not.
     
     Cheers volks.
