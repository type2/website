Sorry to hear about the kid &amp; lecture from mom...

there are uptight, insecure people everywhere.  Our kids vawe at all
kinds of breadloaves, splitties, bricks and EVs.  They get bummed
when their vawes are  returned....

&gt;eyes staight ahead.  When they pull in I see the woman lecturing the kid,
&gt;raising him up right, telling him the perils of friendliness and waving at
&gt;strangers.  They flew up the grade and I didn't see them again.  Arizona
