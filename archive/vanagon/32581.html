Subject: safari windows

has any body out there ever replaced the hinges on a set of safari's.  my 
hinge pin has just busted into many pieces.  the problem is that i can 
not get the rest of it out.  i don't want to, but has anybody replaced 
them befor.  also, does anyone have any spare parts or complete units for 
sale?  i just can't drive a bus with out safari's.
thanks and God BLess
matt
