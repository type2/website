&gt; Weel, unfortunately, the hesitation at highway speeds  has started up again. 

You don't say what year your van is, but my '81 had the same problem when 
traversing railroad tracks and occassionally on the highway.  Turned out 
that one of connectors to the Mass Flow Sensor had gotten pushed back 
into the plug, causing intermittent contact.  The problem appeared to be 
heat related, probably due to expansion/contraction of the boot around 
the plug.  Pushed the connector back into place and haven't had a problem 
since.

&gt; I checked the plugs (They have a grey ash colored covering on all of 
&gt; them((Bosch Platinum))) and the rotor and cap are new as of 2,000 miles ago. 
&gt;  How can I tell if my wiring harness is to blame?  Is there anyway to 
&gt; distingush the new from the old?  The person I bought the bus from cannot 
&gt; remember if he changed the harness or not(no records either). Any ideas as 
&gt; to why this started happening? Vanagon now has 100k.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
