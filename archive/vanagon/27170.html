Subject: Installing engine seal on 77

&gt;Hey now, Bradley...
&gt;  Don't drop the engine ! The seal sure looks big for such a
&gt;small crack, but it's very compressible and you can squeeze
&gt;it in there real easy. &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Just squeeze the
&gt;thing in there till it feels right, then check the other
&gt;side from below the engine. If at the end it turns out to be
&gt;an inch or so short (as it did in my case) you can sorta
&gt;pull a little over the whole length of the thing and that'll
&gt;give you the extra inch...
&gt;                Gregor

Whoa!  For a minute there I thought this was a post from
another discussion list.  That extra inch always feels good,
doesn't it?

And Bradley, if it ends up being an inch *longer* when you
have it all in place, do not, repeat do not, cut it off.
Scrunch it in there tight all the way around.  It will soon
shrink enough to fit just right.

You and your baby will be pleased with the results.

Makes me want to go install an engine seal or something
equally as satisfying.

Yours in rubber,
