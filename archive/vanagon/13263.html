Subject: Re: Syncro Westie With the Front CV (Black and) Blues

Joel,

Thanks for the rapid response to my questions.  I've priced out the inner and 
outer CVs with a good friend of mine who owns an after-market shop.  He was 
willing to do me a personal favor and sell them to me at cost...  Inners waare 
US$48.00 ea. and outers are US$128.00 ea.  

I've also got a very good service manager at one of the local (San Jose area) 
dealerships doing a price/parts availability check for me, as we speak.  I'll 
let y'all know what I find out when I hear back from him.  My concern is that I 
may not have the luxury of having enough time to pull it apart and fix it (time 
has become a precious commodity for me these days) so I may be relegated to the 
dealer to get this repair done before other damage occurs (see note fromTim 
Smith).

On Wed, 15 Mar 95 10:17:14 CST you said:
&gt;I'd like to get some input on the front CVs, i.e. How long have your front CVs
&gt;lasted?  How much did it cost in US$ for each CV?  How much was the overall
&gt;repair is US$?  Is changing front CVs on a Syncro as rudimentary as the early
&gt;'70s type I (rear) CVs?  Any other thoughts or comments?  We currently have
&gt;just over 56K miles on our '90 Syncro Westie and the CVs went south last
&gt;weekend....  They're driving me nuts with the constant clunk, clunk, clunk
&gt;sound, but I'd like to get some feedback from those of you with Syncros before
&gt;I go to get it repaired at the dealer.  Thanks in advance for you advice...

i can't help with the life expectancy (cause i don't have a syncro), but when
i was checking on what it would cost IF i got one (still looking), this is
what i ran into:

- front inner joints: $200 each.
- front outer joints: $300 each (cause they have to also swivel for turning)
- rear inner/outer joints: $100 each.
- all boots $25 each (dealer prices).

you might want to check with that guy in north carolina (Vantastics) who has
a syncro and sells parts for them. he might be cheaper than the dealers.

also: for what it's worth. you might get by with just cleaning and regreasing
them. a very very messy and time consuming job (figure at least all day
saturday), but fairly cheap: $10 for grease. if the boots are torn, you'll
need to spend money on them. :(

other thoughts: vw NEVER puts enough grease into the joints/boots!! i've had
rear joints burn up in 22,000 miles ... so now i cram three times as much
grease into each joint/boot as vw does. and my rears have lasted now for
84,000 miles (cleaned and regreased at 75,000: no burns, no galls, no marks).
some folks say that cv joints should be cleaned and regreased every 30,000
miles or every two years.

the fronts are a bit trickier than the rears. the inners are about the same,
but the outers are just like Rabbits/Golfs. i've seen my brother do his
rabbit in about 30 minutes, so it's not beyond the scope of a backyard
repair, but there is a small stub axle that must be removed from the back of
the front wheels ... so there is more to unbolt than just the joint. but it
seemed a straight-forward procedure, just more involved.

good luck.
joel
