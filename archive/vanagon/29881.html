Subject: /f but true.   an Audi Story- 5 cyl.

I am currently looking for a nice 5000 to buy and use as my work car. 
 the Toyota is running fine at 260,000 miles but like an old dog, 
could pass on at any time.  it has been faithful and doesn't owe me a 
dime.  i really should look for another Toyota but, see, i have this 
personal problem that involves automotive wanderlust and this list.

Yesterday i followed a 5000S for a mile or two until it turned off
into a car dealership.  I pulled up behind it and asthe guy
was getting out, asked him if he'd like to sell his car.  he laughed
and said he was just going to put it on consignment.  i started
looking the car over and asked what the book value ran on these... he
said he'd just looked it up and it was around $6000.  minus $2000 for
high miles (170K).  so that made it $4000.  i started wincing because
it had a BIG rust problem on a rear wheel well and he then said he'd
be really glad to get 'just $2000' for it.  i had him open the hood
and saw a sad and neglected engine.  this guy was in his mid twenties
and wore white shirt and tie, had that slick look. Eddie Bauer jacket
and shiny shoes.  but his shoes were cheap and his Dockers worn. I said,
 'you must be a car salesman here.'    yup. 

He started extolling the virtues of the car and said that &quot;they have
a Volkswagen 5 cylinder in them, you know.&quot;  gee, and i thought
Volkswagens had an Audi in them. Car salesman and Liars both love to
hear themselves talk, and if you give each of them enough time they
will tell you what you need to know.  As i was staring an oily
engine that had acorn shells packed in various pockets he mentioned
the 'only' problem was a small power steering fluid leak.  the level
sensor for the reservoir was disconnected and neatly tucked away.
wiping his clean finger on the hose connection under the reservior he
offered to me that it must just be a loose hose clamp right 'there'. 
i offered back that it might be his power steering sector that was
glistening with fresh oil like a black silk dress.  i thanked him for 
showing me the car but told him i wasn't interested.   &quot;yeah, i'd
really just like to get about $1800 out of it if i could.&quot; was his
last comment as i got back in my Toyota.

anyone want it?   :)
