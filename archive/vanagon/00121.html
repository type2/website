i know for a fact that double sliding doors WERE available for the 1971
model year ... cause when i bought mine, i *almost* ordered one that way.
it would have been a long wait (i think they said three months) for it
to be built and shipped from the factory (cause most double door buses had
no windows). but it was an extra-cost option at the dealer.

and, i'm pretty sure it was also an orderable option for the 1980 model
year ... again, extra cost and a looonnnnnngggg wait.

anybody out there ever seen one?

i have heard on one of the tv car shows/news that chrysler was bragging about
how they were gonna come out with double sliding doors on the caravan/voyager
in 1996 ... and vw announced that they will have double sliding doors on the
Eurovan THIS YEAR!! for the 1995 models (which are also supposed to have the
vr6 engine).
