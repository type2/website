Subject: ~s need more votes!


Thanks for the deluge of responses for my plea to vote for Pinnacles
(not far from Monterey) vs. Panamint Springs (near Death Valley) for
the March 21-24 campout.

WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE!  Presently, the tally is EXACTLY
tied, and we wouldn't want that to happen.  Pick a bandwagon and
jump on it, please!  :)
