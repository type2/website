Subject: Odometer/Speedometer Question 88 Westy
Date: Sun, 20 Apr 1997 00:55:03 -0400

My odometer has died, speedo still works.  I've browsed the archives and
found a number of msgs about the little wheel/gear that breaks.  I can't
seem to locate that part at this point.

I've removed the instrument cluster (no big deal), but I don't see how to
detach the speedometer unit from the rest of the cluster.  It is attached
by the flexible wiring harness which I don't want to cut.  The connections
to the harness seem to be crimped.

Maybe I could get to the part mentioned in the archives if I could get the
face off of the thing.  So how do you get the 'indicator arm' off the shaft
so that you can take the face off?

TIA
