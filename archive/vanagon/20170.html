Subject: Anyone Been To VW Bus Heaven?

Say, I am bringing Ramona in to VW Bus Heaven in Kingston, Ma. on the 10th
and was wondering if any of you other New Englanders have had any experiences
with these folks....They seem like the real McCoy and heavy into what they
do, but a mechanic is a mechanic so I'm a skosh nerved up just the same.
Anyone???
