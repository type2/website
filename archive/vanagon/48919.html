Subject: We're off!

Thanks so much to all who sent suggestions, or offered a bed, shower, or 
driveway space, as Evon and I take our cross country trip in the 83-1/2 
Westy. We leave early this morning for San Francisco, where Kyle Wade from 
Volks Cafe is driving to meet us at the airport in what will be our home 
for the next 3-1/2 weeks.  We look forward to meeting up with some of you 
on the drive back from California to Pennsylvania.  We will take printouts 
of your e-mail with us, and call you in advance if we will be passing 
through your neck of the woods.  Otherwise, if you see a brush-painted blue 
Westy with a &quot;NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST&quot; bumper sticker on the back (a 
Tolkien (sp?) quote), that'll be us.  

My friend Jon will be watching the house for us, and will check my e-mail, 
etc. so we'll stay subscribed and will get any messages when we call in.

It's a bit of a gamble driving a bus cross-country that we've never even 
seen before, but I have lots of faith in Kyle and Volks Cafe, and he 
assures me that the bus is completely ready for the journey. We're both 
very excited about the trip, as neither of us has gone cross-country before 
(other than by plane).  I'll check my e-mail late tonight, and after that 
it's so-long until late September!
