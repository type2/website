&gt; Using a stupid silver regulator?  Never!!!!!  Burned up two engines before I
&gt; figured out they only restrict the fuel.

You are talking about the electric fuel pump?  I don't understand how 
you could burn up the engine by using this?  I would imagine that it 
would just start running crappy if it was not pumping enough fuel.
