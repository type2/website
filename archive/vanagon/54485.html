&gt; Over the past couple of years I have been recommending the Michelin MXLs for
&gt; the EV as an all around tire. It's better in all conditions than the Contis
&gt; that came with my EV, and others have rated it better than the OEM GoodYears
&gt; as well. The MXLs have been good in the snow, and up until last weekend I
&gt; used the Contis and MXLs during the winter.
&gt; 
&gt; However, this weekend, I decided to put some snows on the EV. You see my
&gt; house is located on a steep gravel covered private road. As a result it does
&gt; not get plowed by the town, and after the neighbors, and my wife have driven
&gt; up the road (after a snow storm) the snow is packed and traction on the EV
&gt; is close to zero....so some creative driving has to be done to get up to the
&gt; street. This past weekend after a minor snow storm, I decided to go for some
&gt; snows.
&gt; 
&gt; I picked up a set of Bridgestone Blizzaks. All I can say, is I should have
&gt; done this earlier. Yes, the MXLs are good....but the Blizzaks are excellent
&gt; in the snow and fantastic on the ice. They are supposed to have the
&gt; characteristics of studded snows on the ice...without the studs.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried an experiment with them. My EV has ABS, and one one particularly
&gt; bad street (covered with ice) I would hit the brakes and the ABS would kick
&gt; in (with the MXLs). On the way home (after putting the new tires) I did the
&gt; same with the Blizzaks....the EV stopped quicker, and the ABS barely kicked
&gt; in.

Bridgestone Blizzaks are good but Nokia's Hakkaapelitta No. 10 are even
better.
