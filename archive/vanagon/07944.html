&gt;  Snap, almost. I got a 70 bus for the take it easy and a Kawasaki GPz 550
&gt;  for the ohmygosh sessions. Have many others on the list gone for the
&gt;  bus/bike combination? 

I bought a Vanaogn and sold my Honda CM450E and bought a Linear recumbent.
Having kids made me think twice about taking chances with motorcycles.  Of
course, now that I got run over riding my recumbent, I'm not so keen on
driving anything smaller than a mac truck. No sympathy mail please - my 
mailbox is full as it is.  It was just a point of discussion.
