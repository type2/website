Well, I do not have much of an answer for most of your questions, but
I may have an idea to think about.  I have a '77 that somebody put a 1.8
with carbs into before I bought.  I drove it for a while but eventually the
1.8 needed to be rebuilt.  The carbs never ran very well in the cold so I
wanted to try fuel injection.  I found a rusted out '77 with a complete 2.0
engine and fuel injection for a little over $200.  The owner
claimed that the enginge and trans were in good shape so I made a deal
to just take the engine and transmission, (the body was rusted so bad it was
pretty much worthless.)  Well, I put the 2.0 into my '77 and it runs great.
I don't know if I was just lucky or if maybe you could find something like this.

Also, I have only been getting 16 miles per gallon in the city.  Again, does
anybody know what kind of mileage a 2.0 with fuel injection should get?
Highway or City?
