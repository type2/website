Subject: Vanagon price reduction!
Date: Fri, 8 Nov 96 10:04:56 EST

Hello all,
There is an '82 Vanagon for sale at a dealership in Arlington VA which
has been in the paper for a couple weeks and the price has just been
reduced incredibly!  It was $2750 and is now $1950.

Not too bad of a price reduction.

The van is at Kline Toyota in Arlingtion, and the number is
703-522-6000.

Sean
