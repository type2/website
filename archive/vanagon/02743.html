&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get a set of alloy wheels for my '87 Syncro. Called the nearest
&gt; dealership and was quoted a price of nearly $400 a wheel.
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say, I ain't buying them.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Does anybody know of third party sources for these wheels?
&gt; 

Mercedes has the same bolt pattern and offset.  I was looking around for
15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels a few months back, and a local shop has a number 
of one-piece aluminum wheels, in 14, 15 and (some) 16 inch sizes.  Prices
were about $120 to $160 per wheel for most of the wheels.  

Let me know if you're interested, and I'll try to get the brand name and
styles.  There were a lot of different styles, wire, spoke, brushed 
aluminum, white, anodized, etc.
