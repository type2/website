Subject: CLEANING BUS!!!


Now that I have an engine in my bus and the timing set so it will stop 
backfiring I cleaned it, I've had it since May and this is the first 
cleaning. That Bus of mine was disgusting, old stick resadue all over the 
windows, inches of grime on the rear cargo floor. I don't think anyone 
had cleaned that thing in years, but now it's clean and it looks very 
nice, It's like a whole &quot;new to me&quot; bus.

I only have one problem with my bus the parking lights stay on all the 
time and I can't cut off the engine if the headlights are on, Does anyone 
know if this is a bad switch or a short between two wires. The lights 
don't really bother me, It's kind of a safty measure, bet visability and 
no run down battery from leaving my lights on. Thanks
