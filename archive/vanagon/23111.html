&gt; 1.  Run them and hope they last awhile.

Worked for me so far.  But then the wipers don't really work that well.

&gt; 2.  Get some kind of voltage drop, RMMW sells one for ~$10 which
&gt;     has a 50 watt capacity--this seems too low, am I right?  I've
&gt;     also seen the wiper controller which includes a rheostat to
&gt;     vary the speed--anybody like these?  They're a little pricey.

There was a plan posted here on how to make one.  I have the parts, I 
just haven't tried it yet.

&gt; 3.  Someone told me you could get the motor rewound for 12v.  I'm
&gt;     going to call around to some electrical shops on this.

I-m sure you could do this, with the added benefit that you have a 
rebuilt wiper motor.  But it would probably cost over $50

&gt; 4.  Rain-X

My favorite solution!

&gt; 5.  swap in a 12v mechanism.  Anyone know which years are compatible?

67, good luck finding one in a junked bus... Thom removes them all for 
himself.  And I think they cost well over $100 new.

&gt; Fuel guage:  I don't really know how these things work, please advise.
&gt; If I get a voltage drop, does it power the sender, the guage, or both?

I think it works on resistance, I still have a 6V gauge running off of 
12V, and it reads fine.  But I've heard other people complain about thiers.
