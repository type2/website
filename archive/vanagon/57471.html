Subject: (Fwd) Software upgrade-a funny 


Got this form another list, I'm at this point ROTFL. : )


------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

Last year a friend of mine upgrades Girlfriend 6.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that
it's a memory hog leaving very little system resources for other
applications. He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 also is spawning
Child-Processes which are further consuming valuable resources.
No mention of this particular phenomena was included un the product brochure
or the documentation, though other users have informed  him that this is to
be expected due to the nature of the application. Not only that, Wife 1.0
installs itself such that it is always launched at system initialization
where it can moniter all other system activity. He is finding that some
applications such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are  no
longer able to run, crashing the system when selected(even though they always
worked  fine before). At installation, Wife 1.0 automatically installs
undesired Plug-Ins such as MotherinLaw 55.8 and BrotherinLaw Beta release. As
a consequence system performance seems to diminish with each passing day.

Some features he'd like to see in the upcoming wife 2.0:

- A &quot;Don't remind me again&quot; button
-Minimize button
-An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 be installed with option  to
uninstall at anytime without the loss of cache and other system resources.
-An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which would allow
the systems hardware probe feature to have greater use.
I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by
sticking with Girlfriend 2.0. Even here, however, I found many problems.
Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 2.0 on top of  Girlfriend 1.0. You
MUST uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 first. Other users say this is a long standing
bug which I should have been aware of. Apparently the versions of Girlfriend
have conflicts over shared use of the I/O port. You would have thought that
they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now. To make matters worse, the
ununstall program for Girlfriend 1.0 doesn't work very well leaving
undesirable traces of the application in the system.

Another annoying problem - all versions of Girlfriend continually popup
annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0

*************BUG WARNING**************
Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install mistress 1.1 before
uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before executing a
self-uninstallation. Then Misstress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming
insufficient system resources.

*************BUG WORK-AROUNDS************
To avoid the above bug, try running Mistress  1.1 on a different system  and
never run any file transfer applications such as LapLink 6.0. Also, beware of
any similar shareware applications that have been known to carry viruses that
may affect Wife 1.0. Another solution would be to run Mistress 1.1 via a
UseNet provider under an anonymous name. Here again, beware of the viruses
that can accidently be downloaded from the UseNet.
