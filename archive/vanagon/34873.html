Some of you may remember Bruno - the 65 Campmobile I purchased back in
November.  Fully equipped and a little ;) rusty.

Well I got estimates on rust repair and the lowest was $8,000.00!!  If i
tried to do it myself i would need lots of equipment ($$$).  So he's not
gonna get a life.  All the way around the bus, where the sides meet the
floor, you can see daylight.  All seatbelts came out with a tug.
I am still discovering rodents nests in cabinets.

He is now a parts Bus.

I am stripping all glass and other removeable stuff starting from the top
and working my way down.  This will go on until spring.  Then I will donate
the remains (roof, sides, floor) to anyone who will come and get him.

Joel - please remove 1 (one) 65 Campmobile from the OH - Cleveland stats....
..(sadly)Thanks.

If anyone is interested I have pictures in digital format and can email them
wherever.
