Subject: Re: Use of Tow Dolly to Move a Vanagon

I would see no problem with the tow since the rear axle is off the ground.I
have personally towed my vanagon with all 4 wheels on the ground in neutral
with a tow bar for over 2000 miles without a problem. Just make sure the
steering wheel remains unlocked.
