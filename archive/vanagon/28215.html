Subject: November Camping in Maine??


All this talk of heating a Westy and four season camping has got me 
interested in heading back up to Maine for another excursion.  Would anyone 
know of a campground with shower facilities(hot water a must!)  and electric 
hookups that would be open around Thanksgiving maybe in the Acadia area or a 
little further south?  Or am I nuts?  Maineiacs feel free to chime in, from 
the stats I know your out there!  I was thinking of swinging by Old Town to 
pick up a canoe.

Thanks
Pete
