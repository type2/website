Well I've driven my 1976 type II for several years with the only trouble being
the passenger door handle seizing up.
It had been off the road for 6 years, so it needed some exhaust parts, and
new injectors when I got it.
It even starts at -30F once you learn the trick, which is turn it off,
and try again after the first fart. Continuing to crank won't help.
Seems like the computer needs a power up reset to try again. Sort of like: 

Bug bug bug bug bug bug bug bug bug Blouffe! bug bug

Turn key off. Try again

&gt;Since I am a new list member myself I believe that a lot of new members
&gt;may get the idea that old VW busses (and new ones) are not that reliable.
&gt;Hearing everyone's problems can be somewhat discouraging.  So lets hear some
&gt;good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage busses
&gt;have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
&gt;one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt;without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
&gt;be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.
