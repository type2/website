Subject: Bike Rack for a Bus
Date: Tue, 12 Jul 94 10:33:29 EDT

I just joined the VW Bus mailing list at Joel's recommendation.  I am
looking for a bike rack for my '79 bus and he said that there was recently
a discussion on this topic on the mailing list.  If anyone can help me out
I'd appreciate it.  I'm wondering which kind to look for (on top, back, or
hanging from the front) and where to get one that fits the lovely form of
the bus!!!!  Thanks in advance!!!

Ken, '79 bus
