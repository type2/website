&gt;I just came across a 1985 Westy Synchro w/50k miles for $10k. Is it worth

&gt;What should I be looking for while cheking it out? Advise??

I'd never buy any 1985 Syncro.  VW did not start selling them until 1986 as
1986 models.  Either it's not a Syncro or it's not a 1985 or someone has
assembled their own hybrid.  Valid Syncro model years in the USA are 1986,
1987, 1989, 1990, &amp; 1991.  Question everything else.

Good luck,
