&gt; too!  The only problem was the dead battery when we wanted to leave.  I 
&gt; was listening to the radio and cd player and not recharging the battery.  
&gt; Here comes the begging part.  Does anyone have a gauge in their van to 
&gt; let them know when they have been draining the cells too long?  Since my 
&gt; battery is in the back, is there a way to put another battery in that bay 
&gt; and have it charged via the alternater?  Just wondering??!!?

Sure. Just go to an rv place or an auto parts store, tell 'em you want
the electrical hookup for an auxiliary battery. Lot's of rv's and
campers do this all the time. Then wire the stuff you want to use when
the engine's off - i.e. interior lights, radio, CD, two way radio -
whatever - to the auxiliary battery. Even if you run it down, the engine
will still start normally, and then recharge both batteries.

Don't just hook the two batteries together - it'll just take longer to
run them both down.
