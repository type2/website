Subject: Re:  shakedown trip with infant

We've camped quite a bit with infants/toddlers.  I've generally found once
they get too big to sleep with  - or if one objects to being kicked all
night :-) that the pad on the floor works well if you take something like a
full duffle to block the doorwell.

We've also divided kids and parents - Dad and oldest kid in top bunk, me
and two youngest in bottom.  My sister in law put a kid in a hammock slung
between the two front seats but this is NOT a good option with real small
kids unless one got a rock climber's hammock (impossible to fall out of)
and the kid was likely to sleep through the night since I for one wouldn't
want to have to extract an upset kid from such an arrangement in the middle
of the night!
