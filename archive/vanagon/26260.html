Subject: Re: Double Sliding Doors


Chrysler the FIRST with double sliding doors...yep, just like OJ
is innocent...

I recall in a VW Transporter brochure I have hanging around here
somewhere that in 1971 (the date of this brochure), one could
order a Type 2 with sliding doors on BOTH sides...

And if one wants to go back to &quot;hinged door technology&quot;, we 
ALL know about T1 double door vans!
