Subject: Re: Squeaking from front end (spare tire?) of Vanagon

&gt;My vanagon is just about the noisiest animal I have ever
&gt;experienced- 
&gt;
&gt;I actually had a $1000 front end job done, thinking it was
&gt;my shocks!  To my surprise, the van handled a lot better,
&gt;but was still squeaky as all get out!

Were the ball joints done?  My 1971 gets squeaky ball joints late in it's
front end lube cycle.  I have the kind of joints that you can take a cap off
and attach a grease fitting and lube.  It stops the squeaks cold for a year
and maybe more depending on how much driving I've done.  I do it with the
weight off the joints so I know it's getting into the pressure points, like
acculube.

I'm not sure, but I think y'all Vanagon folks are required to replace those
because there is no grease fitting.  For $1000 I would think it was part of
the procedure, but maybe not.

I will occasionally massage, like accumassage, boots in an attempt to
distribute the grease better in CV's and ball joints, plus, maybe that
grease injection idea could work here?

Also you should, just for giggles, check how tight the mounting bolts are
that hold the entire assembly to the frame.


Sincerely,
Eugene
