Ah, that reminds me of the stray VW wheel on I-5...

I was southbound on I-5 going up the Tukwila hill and the cars in front of me
started hitting their brakes and swerving.  Coming down the hill at a HIGH
rate of speed was a wheel and tire, bouncing straight and true down the
center lane of the highway.  As I approached it, my heartrate went up, but it
went right on by with no fuss.  I watched in the mirror, and for as long as I
could follow it, it was still in the center lane heading for downtown
Seattle, or perhaps Boeing field for some aerodynamic studies.  Oh yeah, in
the northbound lanes was a Beetle scraping along on its rear brake drum.
It wasn't the most frightening moment, but it sure was surreal!
