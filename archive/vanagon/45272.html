Subject: Re: Steering Locks


 Does anyone know what years VW made steerings locks for
vans? I've got a '62 bus and would like a lock for it.
Are they hard to come by?, Was it just steering locks or
gearshift locks as well? How much are these?
- - - -

they made optional ones for all years until they were standard (69?).
yes, they made them for barndoors. (please send me your extra, anyone)

the one for your bus requires a steering column with the hole for the
steering lock to latch into.

they are an excellent way of preventing you bus from being stolen- impossible
to break the lock into releasing the wheel, although it is possible to break
the lock so you cant use it (ie break the cylinder)    They are only  removed
by drilling in a certain location and direction to release what holds the
lock.  nice to have if you live in LA or NYC.   they can disconnection the
wires and hot wire it, but not turn the wheel.

but sorry, don't know who has any available.     my 65
im-really-going-to-get-it-going-soon Eurocamper with steering lock came with
no key so i'll have to take it apart and rekey it to the special
not-like-any-other-key key that i have.
