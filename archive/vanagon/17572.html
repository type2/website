HI ALL,		
 Morris, I have the last 'bug engine' bus from '71.  I think by then the
size of the bus had grown too big for the engine.  It is really sweet,
though, 'cause the engine slips out like a dream...but lacks power.  
  I am quite sure that if you put the upright 1600 into a later bus you	
will find that the power is not sufficient to pass anything going more
than 55 mph.   You could rebuild a 1600 into a larger displacement version,
but I have heard that there are cooling issues related to the load there.
With the bus in particular,  air flow is CRITICAL, and just adequate, so
don't over-do it unless air/oil flow is also modified.  (IMOH)		   
  
KEEP IT COOL!,
 
 Chris '71 Camper (OTTO) and assorted bugs.
