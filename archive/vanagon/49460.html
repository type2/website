&gt;Hi Kids!
&gt;
&gt;Just so you don't load up with too much weight - I thought I'd let you all 
&gt;know that the running water at the campsites is safe -  it is tested 
&gt;weekly by the Feds. Mammoth's water is some of the purest in the state. 
&gt;So, maybe you won't have to schlepp too much of it over the Sierra.
&gt;
&gt;Plus, you can but ice at Red's Meadow Resort - about 4 miles from our 
&gt;campsite.
&gt;
&gt;MARTHA and the Bay Area convoy group... there is a FABULOUS - FREE - 
&gt;Forest Service campground on the west side, on the way into Yosemite on 
&gt;Highway 120. It is called &quot;Carlon&quot; and it is about 1/4 mile off 120 on 
&gt;Evergreen Road - the road into Hetch Hetchy. Just thinking that you could 
&gt;meet Steve and spend Thursday night there. It does not have safe running 
&gt;water so you'll need to schlepp it that far, at least. From there, your 
&gt;drive to Mammoth would only be about 2 1/2 hours - give or take.
&gt;
&gt;Just a thought!  :-)
