RE:	Copy of: Bad Christmas Eve!

&gt; After closer inspection I have a leaking head.  It is a '91 Westy
&gt;with 37,000 miles.  I would think the heads should last longer than that. 

Damn right!!!!   VW should foot the whole bill for a new head gasket job!!!

heads leaking at 37k????  Ridiculous!!  that's poor craftsmanship on VW's part.

anyway, you have an excellent case against VW.  go for it!
