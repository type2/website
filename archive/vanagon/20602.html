Subject: Re: cleaning engine, tins and other dirty stuff

I did the same thing to the '81 Westy's engine last summer, and used
Westly's Clear Magic, a stiff scrub brush (actully several), lots of
elbow grease, and water. Spray the Clear Magic on the tinwork (or 
Simple Green, any of the biodegradable degreasers) and start scrubbing.
Rinse and repeat if neccessary. (Sounds like the back of a shampoo 
bottle, no?) This stuff works well, and isn't full of petrochemicals,
like the aerosol engine cleaners. Used it on the engine compartment
and the engine too.
