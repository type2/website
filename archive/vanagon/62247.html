Subject: SLIDING DOOR DESIGN CHANGES (by year)

I need another sliding door for my '84 van. (dove blue metallic, anyone know
of one in a yard that color??)
Anyway, I know of a '86 Dove blue metallic van that had a good slider door on
it, and tried to swap it with my '84 but it won't work. (rear latching mech.
and track different)

When did they change the design, in '85 or '86?????

I'm guessing these are the intervals, please correct me if I'm wrong:

'80-'82?
'83-'85?
'86-'91?

Is the above correct?

Thanks in advance, 
chris
