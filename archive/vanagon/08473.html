Subject: Elephant Ears

I am attempting to use a pair of authentic Volkswagen &quot;elephant ear&quot;
mirrors for my splitty. Does anybody on this list know the differences
between authentic VW mirrors and aftermarket repros? I was always under the
impression that elephant ear mirrors manufactured by Volkswagen had &quot;VWOA&quot;
stamped on the back of them. Anybody have anything else to add?
