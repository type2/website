Subject: Re: Front Floor Mats--WhereToBuy?

Steve,

I covered the entire floor and back luggage area of my 85 vanagon with 
regular household carpet that matched the colors of the van.  Teh carpet 
is in fairly small patches - lets see:  left front, center, right front, 
front of bench, two pieces under bench, back of bench (by bench I mean 
the center bench in my vanagon) and a piece both above and below the back 
luggage area cushion.

Each piece was seamed around the outside.

Underneath the van is still pristine.  

My wife's uncle did this and it cost my 150DM in 1985, so lord knows what 
this would cost now, but if I were to buy a new van, I'd sure consider 
somethign similar if I could afford it.
