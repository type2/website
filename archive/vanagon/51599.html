Subject: Re: What is a Westy Weekender?

I got my bentley manual over the weekend but just before that, I got a
couple of Digifant II brains to resolder connections on and replace one or
two transistors from my mechanic... After playing with the brains and
popping the backseat up again, I took a closer look at this mysterous
box with cooling fins... Turns out it is the brain and I feel rather silly
for believing the guy when he handed me the propane stuff and saying it
works with something under the back seat...

	So I have a leak somewhere in the aux heater under the back seat as
it smells like coolant when I run the fan with the valve on... Maybe he
inserted some water heater in there that runs off of propane. We'll see
when I rip the heater apart...

	Sorry to get your hopes up for some new interesting heater...
Though I suppose a malfunctioning brain that was dumping heat out the heat
sink in the bottom would be an interesting heater for some ;)
