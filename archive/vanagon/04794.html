Subject:      esp. for Eurovaners ...

in the november 94 issue of Automobile, page 18.:

The spies have it:
Volkswagen's Eurovan ... with the narrow angle VR6 engine and a new front
end ... has been caught testing.  The van will be introduced in January
1996 as a 1997 model.

&lt;picture shows the car ... very different front end. looks more like a
Dodge Caravan now ... instead of a Chevy Astro. :)  why, i'll bet it could
go up hills at 80mph!!! &gt;
