Subject:      Re: Oil plug stripped, fix needed

Eric,
        I had the same problem with my 91' when I bought it. The dealer
put in a heli-coil with a a drain plug that was oversized.  They also used
a plastic gasket instead of the alum. one.  Needless to say it always
leaked because the scarred the sealing surface.

I installed the stock plug and use a 14mm copper crush gasket (same as the
beetle oil drain plug gasket)  This stopped the leak completely!

Before I changed the oil (for the first time) I talked to a machinist.  He
said that he could put in a helicoil with out removing the engine, he uses
a grease on the tap so as to collect most the metal shavings.  Then run
some oil throught the engine to remove any strays.  Be careful with the
sealing suface.

Hope this helps

Dan

&gt;         Imagin my surprise when I went under my &quot;new&quot; 84 Westfalia to change
&gt; the oil and found a one inch bolt sticking out of the oil plug area.  a wing
&gt; nut device ther was holding a rubber stopper in place.  This thing holds the
&gt; life blood of the engine in.  I wiggled it and it fel off in my hand!  My
&gt; oil pan was already there but what if this had happened on the road!!!
&gt;         I replaced the rubber stopper and it seems to be holding.  I ordered
&gt; a new bolt from the dealer but I suspect that the inner threads may be
&gt; stripped.  I'll try a new bolt but then what?  I have a good shadetree
&gt; mechanic near buy but what is the best fix for this?  Help.
