Mine does this too, but I just pulled the fuse and lock the locks in the 
old fashioned way.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi all:   Has anyone had a problem with power locks as follows? If I
&gt; &gt; unlock the drivers door with a key, the lock opens then quickly relocks.
&gt; &gt; If I get the door open while unlocked the lock will just go up and down 
&gt; &gt; until I close the door then it locks and stays. If I pull both front
&gt; &gt; door locks up at the same time, they will stay unlocked (and unlock the
&gt; &gt; rear doors as well) until one of them gets pushed down then they all
&gt; &gt; lock and it acts as I first described. The locks worked well until all
&gt; &gt; at once they started acting this way. I havn't a clue. Thought I'd ask
&gt; &gt; the list before I started pulling my hair out trying to figure out what
&gt; &gt; It's doing. Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Todd,
&gt; 
&gt; This exact scenerio happened to my father-in-laws van.  It turned out to be a 
&gt; buggered power lock motor on the driver door.  He needed a new one.  One 
&gt; question, does this same behavior happen when you open the passenger door 
&gt; first???  If it doesn't, then it is the motor for sure.  This is the third time 
&gt; I have heard of this happening so I wonder if there was a bad run on motors!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck
&gt; Tony
