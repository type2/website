Subject: Free(?) VW History Book


I just received a package from the VW Museum.....in it was a 60pg
book entitled: &quot;An idea that made history - The story of Volkswagen.&quot;
Its a year by year history of VW from 1934 to the present. Lots of 
photos and neat graphs showing the production numbers of bugs, busses, 
and even golfs to date...

The book is published by VW AG and is available
from:
