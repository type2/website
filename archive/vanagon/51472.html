&gt;If they don't tighten, post again, and several of us have some repair =
alternatives.

I've taken my flopping mirrors off, cleaned the ball joint with emery =
paper, tightened the joint and reinstalled the mirror only to have the =
mirror flop around again.  Is there a more permanent fix available?

I was left to thinking that I only had two options left.  Buy a =
replacement or upgrade to electric mirrors.  Which leads to another =
question.  Has anybody upgraded a manual mirror Vanagon to electric =
mirrors?  If so, is it relative straight forward, i.e. any gotchas'?
