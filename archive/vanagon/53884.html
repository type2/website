&gt; I noticed a flat bed tow truck parked in front of 
&gt;  my Syncro,
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;  The above brings up a question, What would that do to the differential, VC

&gt;  and transmission since I left it in gear?

Dragging it up a ramp onto the flatbed may not be ideal for any car, but I
doubt it would cause damage.  The wheels would either roll &amp; turn the engine
over a few times or just skid along the ground.  If it had been a &quot;sling
type&quot; tow truck lifting one set of wheels and leaving the others on the
ground, that would be a different &amp; expensive story.

Here's what Bentley says about towing Vanagons:

A. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION:
1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  Lock the wheels with an
external wheel lock device.  Do NOT rely on the steering column / ignition
switch lock.  No speed or distance recommendation is mentioned in Bentley.
2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground:  Tow van at up to 30 MPH for
up to 30 miles.  Use dollies to lift rear wheels if these limits must be
exceeded.
3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van at up to 30 MPH for up
to 30 miles.  Driveshafts may be removed if these limits must be exceeded.

B. MANUAL TRANSMISSION ( two wheel drive):
1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  Lock the wheels with an
external  wheel lock device.  Do NOT rely on the steering column / ignition
switch lock.  No speed or distance recommendation is mentioned in Bentley.
2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground:  Tow van at up to 50 MPH for
up to 50 miles.
3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van for unlimited speed
for unlimited distance.  (Yes, the Bentley book actually says unlimited
speed.  I can just hear the phone call now: &quot;Well, I was towing the Vanagon
behind the Blue Flame out here on the Bonneville Salt Flats and.....&quot;)

C. MANUAL TRANSMISSION ( Syncro, All Wheel Drive):
1. Towing with only FRONT wheels on the ground:  NEVER! (Unless I suppose
you've disassembled part of the drive train to prevent problems!)
2. Towing with only REAR wheels on the ground: NEVER! (Unless I suppose
you've disassembled part of the drive train to prevent problems!)
3. Towing with ALL FOUR wheels on the ground:  Tow van for unlimited speed
for unlimited distance.

My comments: 
When towing with all for wheels on the ground, make sure the steering column
ignition switch lock is unlocked.
