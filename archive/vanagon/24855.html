Subject: RE: Pwr Brake Vac Hose (was RE: Idle Probs)

&gt;&gt;I would NOT
&gt;&gt;use regular heater hose since there is a chance it might collapse and
&gt;&gt;surprise you one day while braking.  I am using Wire Reinforced 1/2&quot; heater
&gt;&gt;hose (made by Gates--a.k.a. shape to fit hose).  It's as tough as the VW
&gt;&gt;vacuum hose but much cheaper.
&gt;
&gt;Where did you get it?
&gt;

You can get it at your FLAPS--its typically used to replace the factory
preformed/angled heater hose on water pumpers.  It works nicely as power
brake vacuum hose. The guy behind the counter should know it as wire
reinforced heater hose.

&gt;&gt;It's a good idea to get a new rubber grommet on the firewall where the
&gt;&gt;vacuum hose passes through if yours is missing/dried out.  The metal edge 
&gt;on
&gt;&gt;the hole in the firewall could saw through your hose with all the engine
&gt;&gt;vibration.
&gt;
&gt;Was this from VW? Or aftermarket, or HW store etc?

You can bring your grommet to a hardware store and match it up.  I bought
mine from Home Depot (large hardware store).
