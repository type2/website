Subject: Re: Midas or not

I used Midas for a catalytic converter on an '86 GL. In and out in &lt; 2 hr.
Cost: $220.00 vs. Dealer $900.00.  Catalytic is still working 3yr later ;)

Just took my EV there to have some stuff checked.  They tack welded the 
heat shield, to stop rattle, FREE.  I know that's not extraordinary, but 
the dealer wants $27 just to look at the vehicle, not find out what's 
wrong, and certainly not fix it for free.

&gt; Any reason not to use Midas for a new muffler on an '87 Syncro? I'd consider 
&gt; doing it myself, but I have no garage and it's a bit nippy right now. And 
&gt; every time I've messed with exhausts, the dang bolts break off. Plus, if I 
&gt; get Midas, it's the last one I'll have to pay for. They want $250 for the 
&gt; complete job.
