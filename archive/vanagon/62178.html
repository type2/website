Subject: Inspection BLUES

Hey, my brother tried to pass inspection yesterday w/ his 1980 Vanagon
air-cooled and he failed because of CO2 emissions.  What could be done
to pass inspection quickly, then what should we look for to repair?
					Later,
					  B.

P.S.- I found out the clutch problem was a human error, I had been
driving in third (major play in the shifter). Any tips would be useful. 
Any trips on the East coast?
