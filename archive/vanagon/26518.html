Subject: 1973 bus with single weber timing question
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 1995 13:30:18 -0700 (PDT)

hello all,
	me again in search of a clue.  well last night i adjusted the
points.  took me a million and seven tries but i finally got a dwell
reading of just below 50 degrees.  and i actually understand how the
distrubtor works now.  for those that remember my night of no start
and temp loosing power i'll be looking into a loose wire or short in
the ignition system also, but that may take a while (thanks everyone
who replied with advice).

today i am going to try and adjust my idle and timing.  i have a weber
single carb and a vacum type distributor.  i was told that the timing
for a weber with a mechanical advance distributor was 32 BTDC, would
this be different for me since i have a vacum type instead of a
mechanical?  

i have the basic ideas on how to adjust the idle and do the timming
(i'll be using a strobe light gun, this going to be ok or is there a
better way?)  any advice specific to webers would be greatly
appreciated, or any advice on the idle/timming adjustment would be
great (or compression tests as that is next, but that seems pretty
straight forward).

as always thanks everyone, you guys are just as good as a
knowledgeable friend peering over my shoulder and offering advice (or
sometimes yelling at me when i deserve it:) as i go.

take care,
	brandy
