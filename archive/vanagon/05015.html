&gt;&gt; so what does a Eurovan look like?  well, it ain't a loaf of bread. it ain't
&gt;&gt; a brick. it's rounded, tall, and has a short nose. hmmmmm. 
&gt;
&gt;Rounded?  Tall?  Short nose?  Sounds like Stimpy!

	Doh!  My '72 Westy is named Stimpy!  It always seemed to be a 
	Stimpy, at least to me (My SO at the time I discovered his name
	wasn't impressed.  She thought he was Bertha, or maybe Helga.  Not
	for this bus, just has the wrong personality...)
