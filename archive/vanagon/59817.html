Subject: Re: Vanaru / Subagon XT6...2.5L&amp;2.2L

Good info Jim,  but last time I asked Mr. Kennedy about the 2.5L Subaru, he
said the  2.2L was still a better choice due to the power band and RPM
range....  I guess it's power band matches the Vanagon Tranny perfectly.

Beware, the Westie may suffer a mod to the bed and unless you are fairly
clever with cutting and welding the oil pan, you may suffer the loss of a
little ground clearance.

I'm still looking at the possibility because I can get a low mileage Subaru
2.2L for $700 to $1,100 with all the electronic stuff that goes with it.
 However, having a Syncro Westie,  I have not been able to get all the info I
need about how the Kennedy kit will translate to the Syncro.  I want to keep
the ground clearance,  the AC, the snorkle style air intake and I still like
the lower bed better than the upper one.

The exhaust is another question.  Kennedy makes one to fit the Vanagon, but
I'm not sure how it fits my need for original ground clearance.

I'm thinking of taking a trip to Southern California to find out by letting
them make all the measurements and comparisons.....  Or, if someone from SO.
California wouldn't mind drivng theirs over to Kennedy???   It seems they
have not had the chance to really compare the Syncro to the Vanagon.

Anyway, I love the Syncro and the Westphalia design,  but after spending
almost $700 to go through just the fuel injection system, (and it's still not
right) I don't feel much loyalty toward the engine.
