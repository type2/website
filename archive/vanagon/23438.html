Subject: re: fires et al

Hey,
Actually I had never heard of engine fires in VW's being a problem 
until today. Now I can add that to the list I carry in my head of 
things to worry about as I drive along. If I wasn't so much in love 
with the bus I probably would buy a Honda, cept you can't open the 
fridge, wash your hands in the sink or pop up the camper top in a 
Honda. And not to mention how much I enjoy watching the expressions of 
exasperation of my neighbors who get the privilege of being behind me 
in the morning when I hit that hill ( the one going up) on the way to 
the state road, I never work the engine too hard in the morning (figure 
she is like me, give her a little while to get the caffeine in her 
system).
Peace,
Scoob
