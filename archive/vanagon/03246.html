 Hi,
	This is a preliminary note to let you volks know that I'm going
to be dropping out of circulation for a while. I'm leaving work on the
31st August and Judy and I set off for Quito, Ecuador on Sept 12th.
 We plan to spend the next nine months touring South &amp; Central America and
then meet up with the Transporter Trek in May (see some of you then!).

 I'll be here another week, anyway, and then I'll unsubscribe. I will keep
this account and hope to telnet in occasionally from South America. If anyone
wants occasional email let me know &amp; I'll try &amp; send you some.

 I'd like to thank everyone for their help and entertainment over the last
few years, I hope I'll &quot;meet&quot; up with you again soon. Some of you I hope to
see on the trek.

 We're selling our '71 Westy (sob, sniff) to a friend of mine and will buy a
van when we get to California in May (San Diego?) to take on the trek.

 Joel: One less '71 Westy from the stats list. Guess the '85 Vanagons have
the lead again!

Cheers,
        W.
