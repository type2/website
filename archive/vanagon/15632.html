Leo criticized Mike for not taking his Vanagon on a trip and renting
a Mini-shitbox....

Leo, let me come to Mike's defense....I had a choice to rent a mini-shitbox
or a T4 Caravelle GL (the 9 passenger version of the EuroVan) while
I was in France in Jan 94. Yep, the T4 had only the 4 cylinder...
and boy it sure made easy work of the Alps in France, Italy and
Switzerland! We drove circles round the mini-shitboxes, which incidentally
are sold in Europe, as well as available for mindless american-need-an
automatic-transmission-dweebs!
