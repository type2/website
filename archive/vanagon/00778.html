Subject:      jump seat?  camper...

I'm not sure what you want to call it but my 85 vanagon GL westy had the seat
for the middle. The seat is exactly like the driver &amp; front passenger seat but
it is mounted on a storage compartment (much like the glove
compartment.._dot_complete with lock). I have it wrapped in plastic as we prefer
the space. Everyone we've ever mentioned it to was real &quot;wide-eyed&quot; and
mentioned it was as good as gold but $900! No wonder more people don't order
them. Then again, it is cheaper than a larger van...
