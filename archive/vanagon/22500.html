Subject:       Wanted:  seat belt.  can trade for a wierd step.

Does anyone have a set of seat belts i could install in the middle 
section of the '87 Westy rear bench seat.  Need the black ones with 
the orange buckle release.  Please contact me.

Also, i have an entry step that slides into the front and rear jack 
points on the vans.  it reportedly came on a 70's bus but still fits 
the vanagon.  NOTE:  it is extremely rusted.  the embossed/textured 
metal facia is rusted thru completely but the frame is good.  i don't 
know if it's VW product or what.  Maybe it's worth alot, maybe 
nothing.  Is it worth a set of seat belts?
