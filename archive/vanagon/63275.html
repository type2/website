Subject:      Price check on 82 Diesel Westi

Hey Folks,
        I just signed back onto the list after a 2 month absence and I am
continuing my search for &quot;the perfect Westi&quot;.  There is a diesel for sale
in my area and it sounds very nice.  It has 100,000 miles on it with an
engine rebuild within the last 10,000 miles.  The fuel distributer and
alternator have been replace within the last 5000 miles.  The body sounds
great with little or no rust (it has been stored winters).  The interior
has a few stains and no rips. I have 2 questions:

        1. What do list members think the general price range should be
        (Kelly Blue Book puts it around $4000)?

        2. How difficult and expensive is it to put a gas power plant into
        the van if the diesel is to slow?

        I really appreciate the time people take to answer my questions and
I hope to hear from you soon.


Thanks,
Stephen
