&gt;Do you know what kind of alloy wheels can be put on a '73 Bus?
&gt;(Porsche,BMW...?)They should have 5 holes in a 112mm circle.
&gt;I know that Empi make some but I don't really like these ones.

Mercedes-Benz wheels will fit.  You will need the M-Benz lug nuts.
I suggest you try them on and make sure there is enough clearance
in the wheel wells before you invest.
