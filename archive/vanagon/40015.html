In a message dated 96-04-14 23:53:36 EDT, you write:

&gt;stoplights.  20 psi combined with 250 degree oil temperature is
&gt;definately running too hot.  One more thing you can do:  Check your
&gt;compression, especially if you don't know the history of your engine.
&gt;You're not only looking for low compression, but HIGH compression as
&gt;well.  If it's over 120 in any cylinder it's possible you have a high-
&gt;compression engine, or that there is a ton of carbon built up on top of
&gt;the piston.  This could well cause you to overheat.  I'm a believer in
&gt;low compression air-cooled VW engines, even though I don't know what my
&gt;compression is cause I didn't cc my heads (&lt;--Deliberate attempt to get
&gt;Bob Hoover's goat  :-))
&gt;
&gt;

Well here's what I have:

#1     92/95    (jumps to 120 with a little oil)
#2     128
#3     135
#4     135


Clearly a problem with #1 which I assume to be rings given the effect of the
oil. All of the others of course exceed your goal of 120. In your opinion,
would these levels lead to running hot?  What would you do with these #s?

BTW, the plugs were beautiful. Happened to be Autolite 404, any idea if that
is actually the right range?

Thanks for your help,

Weston
