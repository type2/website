Subject: Mineral to Synthetic?

With all this talk about synthetics, is there a suggested converion for the
weights between mineral and synthetics.  I am using 10-30 Castrol GTX now.
 What weight would I use if I were to switch to synthetic?  I have an 85
Vanagon GL Westy with a 1.9l waterboxer.  Only 700 miles on the rebuild
engine, so I couldn't switch for a while.
