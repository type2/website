A

&gt;Anyone have an idea what this bug is worth, in its present condition and/or
&gt;after full restoration?  We're told there are only -4- '56 Bugs in Calif.
&gt;
&gt;Pointers to good manuals and how-to's on rust removal and body work would be
&gt;much appreciated here.
&gt;

Hi,  I just thought I may be able to put in a little input. In the Oregonian
(Portland paper) today there is a '55 bug for $1000. It says it's
restorable. There has to be more than 4 '56 bugs in CA. Phone number for
the'55 is 503-251-2690
