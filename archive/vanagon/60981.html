Subject: EV serpentine belt (was EV malfunction woes)


Wouldn't the main problem running without the belt be loss of the 
charging system/alternator?  With the Audi 5 cyclinder, the waterpump
is run by the timing belt, so you wouldn't have to worry about overheating.
I'm wondering what problems there could be running without the alternator
(assuming no headlight, wiper, etc. power consumption).

Anyone figure out how install and properly tension a serpentine belt?  I've
looked under there but it doesn't look intuitive.  I know there's a special
lever-type tool that's used from underneath.  I'm hoping there's a substitute
that one could fashion.  Somthing I find scary is that the engine has to 
be lowered for access if for some reason you have to replace the idler pully!

&gt; I could not dive the vehicle any more since the serpentine belt, TYHE
&gt; ONLY belt, wss broken.

FWIW, as some may recall, I lost a belt on my 93 GL (Stella) a few years ago
due to a rat attack.  I drove Stella home that night and to the dealer the
next day.  Put probably 50 miles on her sans-a-belt.  Steering was a
little harder (without power), but she drove just fine.
