No crude jokes, please (well, maybe just one-- it's approaching 
Fried-day)

I use a product called Kroil made by Kano Labs in Nashville, TN.  
Several machinists up here in the hinterland swear by the stuff so I 
bought a gallon.  It does seem to be good stuff.  Possibly better 
than Liquid Wrench etc. but this sort of thing is so hard to objectively 
evaluate.  The cheesy literature one in flooded with if you get on 
their mailing list suggests it will cure everything.  They make 
several products and all are hyped in that 1950's over-exclamitory 
style of advertising.  Their marketing tactics aside, it does seem to 
work well.  

Anyone have experiences with this they'd like to share?

IF you're interested, the address is:
  KANO Laboratories
  1000 S. Thompson Lane
  Nashville, TN 37211-2627

Prices run about $15 per gallon but they offer lots of 'package 
deals' with squirting dispensors, aerosol cans etc.
