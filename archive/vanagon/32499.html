&gt;What are recommended spares to carry around that are vw specific.  My 87 
&gt;syncro is pushing 135kmi and I'd like to put together an emergency kit so's 
&gt;my chances of being stranded are reduced. 
&gt;
&gt;starter relay (what other relays or electrical components should be incl.)
&gt;a section of coolant hose and some couplings ,belts, coolant

Three more things I take along now are: 
A foot of small dia. coolant hose and clamps. 
V-Belt for the water pump and the hex wrench for the adjustment bolt. 
Throttle cable.
These three things have left me stranded in my 87.
