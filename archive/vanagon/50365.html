Subject: Re: A True Tire Story

&gt; Little scary.  Goes along with the Icelandic 4x4 drivers who
&gt; remount tires that have popped off the rim by using starting fluid and a
&gt; match =:O.  tim

Speeking of mounting tires yourself...i learned how to do it from my 
friends dad, who does it with the tires for his earthmoving equipment. 
&lt;accually the same guy i got my 74 super from&gt;
After prying off the old, and prying on the new, to reseat it, you just 
spray a small bit of fluid in and on the edge of the tire. toss the the 
match at it, and hope it doesnt explode. WARNING!!!! IT IS HIGHLY 
RECOMMENDED NOT TO DO THIS!! but, when your 16, and dont have money to 
get the tires replaces, and got a good set for free....................

but, a very important point after the tire seals, is to let it sit for 
1/2 an hr or so with the valve core still in, to suffacate any flames, 
&lt;half hr is just a safety factor..&gt; then remove the core and let the 
fumes air out!! very important!! and, if your good and paranoid, reinsert 
core, and fill tire, and remove core again...just to be sure you got the 
fumes out....



anyway......david
