Last two trips (with mice) were:

Upper Nooksak River, on the NW side Mt. Shuksan in WA state. Camped right on
the river bar here.

PG&amp;E campground (I forget the name) on the road between Shasta City, CA and
Reno, NV.

They seem to be nocturnal creatures, never see them in the daytime.

&gt;&gt; Often when I go camping I have problems with mice getting into my
&gt;Westfalia.
&gt;&gt; I've sealed the front air vents with wire mesh, so I don't think they can
&gt;&gt; enter that way anymore. The last trip I took, I observed the varmits
&gt;&gt; blatantly leaping in the open sliding door! I really don't like to keep
&gt;my
&gt;&gt; van closed up all the time when camping so I need some way to keep these
&gt;&gt; pests out. I'm thinking about trying one of those ultrasonic pest
&gt;repellant
&gt;&gt; devices, but I'm skeptical as to whether they will really work. Has
&gt;anyone
&gt;&gt; tried these devices before? I guess I could start taking a cat with me...
