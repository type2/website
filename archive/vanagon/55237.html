Subject: Thank you's much deserved!

Well I called my friend Wendy to get Craig &quot;doc&quot; Taylor's phone number, he
turned me on to the vanagon list, where I found Ian Webb's relay from Noah
Merritt's message about his &quot;80 westy on the UVA newsgroup!  talk about going
around yer elbow...  The camper comes home on saturday, in search of a new
engine. (air cooled 2.0) appreciate any east coast reman/new  quality engine
source.
