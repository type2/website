Ok, got the scanner working!

I've added pix of my '56 up next to this car that wanted to race for pinks.
Yeah, right!  Like he has a chance.  Interesting picture, but it was a
crappy original.  If the opportunity arises, I'll re-take the pix.  

For those who are curious, the other car is a Ferrari F40.  One of the many
interesting cars in the Alldata parking lot...

I also have some pix of the '55 FireWagen that Clara and I have been going
on and on about.
