&gt;me personally, i'd rather drive late at night, on the interstate, with nothing
&gt;but 18-wheelers on the road with me. cause those drivers have been through
&gt;some really good training ... well, at least, much more than the average Joe
&gt;behind the wheel of his Taurus ... i can count on one hand the number of times
&gt;i've been menaced by a big truck, in 36 years of driving. the 4-wheeler count
&gt;is just too high to even keep track of. every day, it's at least two or three.
&gt;which is why i stay the hell off the highway on holidays like these ... yeah,
&gt;i know: i'm an old fart. :)
&gt;

Very true, except for those times when they have a delivery deadline to
meet and have been driving for days on end...

&gt;but, to paraphrase an old aviation saying:
&gt;There are Old Drivers, and there are Bold Drivers.
&gt;There are NO Old Bold Drivers.
&gt;
&gt;remember, folks: be careful out there. ;)

Say Joel, you wouldn't happen to be an old aviator?

PS: Before I forget, you sent me some microfiches a couple of years
back, and for the longest time they were gathering dust.  Last week
however I needed some parts for my wife's Fox (you know, the dreaded
'dealer-only' thing), and they came in very handy...  Thanks!
