&gt;Well, I was told about channel VW on 'The Efnet'.  Well I've stopped by a 
&gt;few times and that there was no one there to chat with. Sure there was a 
&gt;couple of people on the channel, but they were not talking.   Anyway, I'm 
&gt;going to set a date to have a live chat nite.  Next Friday February 17th
     
        Did the same thing, same results. I'm game, just remind us around
Thursday or so...
     
Peace,
