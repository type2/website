I don't know what you can find &quot;over there&quot; but I have a Fiamma (Italian)
that attaches to the hatch, no drilling required. It carries two MTBs 
without trouble and they have stayed put even trough the roughest 
washboards. It's so easy to bring the bikes now that we always have them
with us. 

There's also an attachment available for holding skiis.
I'm attaching a section of big water pipe horizontally, in front of 
the bikes for storing the fishing rods, hiking staffs and other long, 
unwieldy objects.

Poelcher is another brand like that, from Germany.
