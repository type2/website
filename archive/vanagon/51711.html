Subject:  RE:'83.5 wasserboxer idling strange

Tony Wrote:

As the subject says, my bus is idling strange, whether warm or cold. It's
almost like you lightly touch the gas pedal every second or so. The
rev/idle is very consistent and rhythmic. It doesn't seem to effect the
drivability at all and doesn't stall when idling for extended periods, say
10 minutes.

Tony,
  What you are experiencing is a high idle being overridden by the fuel cut
off switch.  If you disconnect the wires from the switch on the throttle
you'l notice that the idle speeds up.  It will problably be about 1500 to
2000 RPMs.  What you need to do is find the cause of the fast idle.  It
more than likely is a vacume leak of some sort or the timming is advanced.
What the switch on the throttle does, actually there is 2 of them. One is a
full throttle switch the other is a fuel cut off switch.  THe fuel cut off
is just that, when the egine is running over 1500 RPMs and you deselerate
the switch tell the control box to shut of the fuel.  When it drops under
1500 the control box takes over and lets it idle normally.  MY 83.5 used to
do the same thing.  I checked and changed all of the vacumme lines and put
new boots on the air intake runners. Then I found the Aux air by-pass was
leaking slightly so I replaced it and that took care of it.  If you check
everything and find there isn't a problem the I would adjust the idle screw
on the throttle.  Hope this helps.  Take care.
