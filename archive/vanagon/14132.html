Red Rock Trip Report Part 1 - The Excursion (long and probably
boring) (Lot's of blah-blah-blah ;) )

Well for me, the trip began by getting my '91 beastie loaded
and ready to go.  This included cleaning out the water tank
which was just filling it with tap water, taking it for a 
drive, letting it sit for an hour or so and then draining
it.  All this during a nasty rain storm.  A trip to the 
grocery store for all the essential food groups: cookies,
chips, beer, eggs, beer, beans, beer and oh, some more beer. 

I loaded up the camper Wednesday night with the tool box, 
propane stove and 20lb tank, lantern, white gas, bag of
cloths, spare grill for fire cooking, cleaned and prepped
the porta-potti, cassette tapes, fire wood (two boxes), ice
chest full-o-groceries, spare ice chest for ice, sleeping
bags, tubs for washing and grey water, books, Bentley and
a few other misc. items like ear plugs for uninterupted
sleep. ;)

Well, I was suppose to leave Thursday night after work but
I bailed out cause I didn't feel I could make it to the Tulare
rest stop previously discussed as the meeting point, so I
decided I'd leave in the morning instead.  So I set the alarm
for 4:00AM and relaxed for the rest of the evening.  

At 4:00AM Friday, I woke up to the alarm and kissed the wife
good-bye and grabbed my wallet, keys etc. and headed out.  
Stopped at a donut shop and bought some organic coffee and
donuts and headed down HWY 50 to HWY99.  

Now let me tell you, for those of you not familiar with HWY
99.  It is about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It's
been around since I think dirt was formed.  There are still
signs for dinosaur crossings.  You can even see where they've
left tell-tale pot holes from them crossing.  It's kind of
interesting as you are entering each town, you can see how
they by-passed the old sections of the highway that enter
the towns.  I remember in the 50's and 60's when there were
no by-passes and we did have to go through those towns.  No
music back then, just my dad listening to the news radio with
the same reports over and over and over. 

Well, I went through several radio stations and then switched
to tapes listening to the Eagles Hell Freezes Over tape that
I recorded from Al Knoll's CD which he lent me over last
week (thanks again Al) and I know he misses it and I will try 
to get it back to him this week.  So I listened to that and some 
Doors, Dire Straits.  Good tunes to keep me hummin' along.

I figured I'd need gas around Merced and I wanted an Arco so
I waited and at Merced I had ~ 240 on the odometer.  I know
that I'd have about 40 more miles to go but I like filling
up at about 220 miles.  But I couldn't find an Arco while
driving through Merced plus the sun was just right so that
it silhouetted all of the signs for gas.  So I continued on
thinking there would be plenty of little sleepy towns along 
the way for there to be an Arco in the next 10 or 20 miles.
Well, as it turns out, there isn't anything after Merced for
quite a stretch.  So I was gettin' a bit nervous and gauged
how far I'd want to drive before turning back to Merced.  I
came up with about 15 miles, so keeping my eyes peeled for
anything I finally came upon a little place that was mostly
for trucks and pulled in there.  It was a pot-holed parking
lot and I found my way to the auto fill-up section and was
a bit leery about filling up with their gas because I'm sure
it wasn't used too often.  So I only got $5 worth and headed
back down the road, in the wrong direction.  This was because
it was one of those places where you have to go back a mile
or so to get turned back around again.  Ugh!  Only 300 more
miles to go.

I continued on and got to a Shell station in Madera only to
find out that it was closed up and I figured that the person
didn't show up for work for one reason or another and so I
continued on.  I filled up at a Chevron cause I didn't want
to make any more stops.  

The drive was pretty much mindless from then on till Bakersfield
although I was noticing off in the distant Sierras that there
was quite an accumulation of clouds in general area to which I
was headed.  So I tried to find some info. on the radio for what
was going on in that area.  All I could find were singers with
nasal voices crooning out about their lost loves in their sordid
lives. ;)  So I continued on and finally got to Bakersfield where
I had the 20lb. propane tank filled and was informed that my tank
on the vanagon didn't need any propane.  I wonder if that tank
ever gets empty?  I've used it for over a year on the fridge.  
Well, I had to get a cap for the 20lb-er for travel so I went to
an RV place next to the gas station and got a cap for $1 and was
on my way.

The drive on highway 58 through the Tehachpe's was gorgeous!  
Especially since it had a rare sprinkling of snow on the lower 
hills as well as the upper mountain sides.  All the way were scenes 
of trees and rocks and vegetation with the white powder accents.  
What a treat! I also saw a EV going in the other direction that had 
a pop-top but I wasn't sure if it was a weekender/multivan or the 
full camping Winnebago outfit.  There was also a train track that 
meandered through the hillside on the right that had an actual train 
running on it carrying several carloads of truck trailers.  As I got 
out to the Mojave side, I watched as the train headed out into the 
desert and thought, boy, what a boring ride that must be.  I hope 
he gets paid well.  

There are also many windmills on the hillsides just outside of Tehachpe.  
There was snow covered all over the town. It was a beautiful sight.  
As I got to the Mojave area, the scenery got dryer and cactus was 
abundant as well as the sage brush.  But it was greener than it 
usually would be and probably as green as it would ever get because 
of the excessive rain.  Lots of washes and dry riverbeds that had 
recently been filled from the rains.  

Highway 58 finally converged with Highway 14, so I headed north and saw
more of the same dry vegetation as I drew near my destination, the greenery
gave way to pushed up rocks and red landscape.  Dramatic rock formations
on boths sides kept me entertained and I knew for sure I was in the right
place.  I spotted the sign for Red Rock State Park and prepared for a
left turn.  Around a bend the sign showed itself and I had to laugh because
the name of the road into the place was 'Abbott Rd'.  Sorry Bill, but
ya should've been there. :)  The paved road went for about 1/2 mile and
then you turned into the campsite entrance.  I parked and hopped out of
the van and was met with a cold breezes.  Whew!  I had to put a sweatshirt
on.  So I went in and talk with the ranger person and got my camp spot
where I was told the others were.  Got back in the van and traveled 
around the wide loop of gravel road and lo and behold I arrived at 
the afore mentioned sight where there sat a cream colored Vanagon
and a split '66.  I knew who those belonged to and I knew that thing 
would be interesting from then on.........
