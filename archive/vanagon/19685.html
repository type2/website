I have not looked at the known web sites recently.  Does anyone have an up-to-date
picture of Thom's bus anywhere?

 &gt; &gt; I agree, and paying more for a straight bus almost makes sense in my case,
 &gt; &gt; since I took a $400 &quot;turd&quot; and sank close to $7k into it!  But then again,
 &gt; &gt; straight, rust free '56 kombis (sunroof) aren't exactly a dime a dozen!
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thom,
 &gt; 
 &gt; I would think if you were to sell (not that I think you should) it as it is 
 &gt; today, you could easily get $14K for it.  Just because it's in such good 
 &gt; condition for a '56.  Not to mention all the vintage parts you've restored.
