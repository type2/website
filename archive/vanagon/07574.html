Subject:       delayed starters, hammers, cables

Deja Vu--
The Dreaded Delayed Start.  I fought this worthy adversary, nearly 
lost my mind but emerged victorious.  Scenario:  Cold, morning, turn 
key and if you're lucky it starts after a perplexing (1-2-3 second) 
wait.  Maybe no start.  Get out.  Crawl under van and rap starter 
once with hammer, ahhhhhh. cranking now.  One comment, the cranking is 
getting very weak despite a new Interstate (TM) battery.

My delayed start (and weak crank) eventually turned into no start 
(unless the hammer rap, my wife got adept at delivering strategic 
blow too).  I removed the starter and 'went thru it' and thought I 
solved the problem by polishing up a somewhat sticky/corroded 
solenoid.  Replace starter expecting the world but got slapped
with no change.  Remove starter, order new solenoid assembly and 
replace.  No change.  Remove starter, take to my favorite auto 
electric guy and have him 'rebuild' it.  Replace starter, no change.
Add an additional big-ass welding cable to the existing one and 
clean all negative grounds.  No change.  Many desperate calls 
to rebuilder, lots of advice and vain searches in the ignition 
switch, wiring, etc.  Remove starter, take back to favorite guy and he 
'goes thru it' again.  Everything tests fine tho he says.  Replace 
starter, no change.  BTW I'm getting VERY good and pulling this 
sucker off now.  
Check all appropriate voltage drops and fix up a few bad 
connections.  With me at my wits end my rebuilder says I've been thru 
the mill enough and that some-times a problem just can't be found 
while its on the bench.  He orders a new Bosch unit from the dealer 
and gives it to me (yes, I said gives as in free) stating he'd 
rather keep me as a customer and have me speak well of himbut he's a 
good guy with a family to feed so I pay half.  Replace with new unit 
and everything has been fine for over 2 years now.

BTW, if you live in cold climes, I highly recommend adding to your 
existing starter cable with an additional one.  I can't remember the 
guage of welding cable I added but in retaining the existing one and 
adding the monster I effectively tripled the OE diameter.  The van 
just simply cranks and starts at all temps including sub -30 F 
mornings.  A fresh battery helps too and maybe I bought a bill of 
goods with the Interstate but it sure works.
