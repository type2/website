&gt;No disrespect but by Chryslers definition the rear engined buses are not

&gt;
&gt;Cab forward is the engine mushed as far forward as possible with the

Not really.  The intent is to get the CAB forward.  Their method of being
able to move the cab forward was to push the engine and wheels forward too so
as to make room for the cab to move forward.  The reason for moving the cab
forward?  To gain additional interior space.  One of the auto magazines a
couple of years ago did a little bit of &quot;space&quot; analysis and compared the new
&quot;cab forward&quot; Chryslers to Ford's Taurus and Chevy's Lumina.  They concluded
that when compared to it's overall size, the new Chryslers did not have
sigificantly more room than Ford &amp; Chevy's older models.  They concluded that
the new design was really &quot;windshield forward&quot;!!
