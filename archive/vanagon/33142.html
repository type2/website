Subject: better than stickers--licence plate frames!

licence plate frames with your email address in them or Vanagon.EDU etc.
whatever you want them to say:

http://www.lookup_dot_com/homepages/48618/plate.html

I ordered a set with my email address. Perhaps I should have put
&quot;Vanagon.Internet.List&quot; or something like that since my email address will
surely change some day (I starting to hanker for a 128K ISDN line).
Moreover, there's no indication that I'm on the list.

Still, anybody on our list who saw a &quot;drew_at_interport_dot_net&quot; licence plate
would know I was on the list, wouldn't they?
