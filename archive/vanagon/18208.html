Subject: Re: brake question

&gt;On my brother's `61 he has an interesting brake problem--the passenger rear
&gt;wheel will start dragging. All new brake stuff except lines. You can
&gt;go to the rear and loosen the bleeder screw and there will be some pressure,
&gt;back the adjusters off a bit, and it will be fine until the next time.

Sounds like swollen brake hoses, right by the hubs. They let enough fluid in 
when you step on the pedal, due to high preesure, but won't drain back fully 
due to the hoses being swollen shut inside. New hoses, stainless with teflon 
liners is nicest fix, anything would be an improvement however.   tim s.
