Subject: More songs for da trip....

It's so strange to have time to read my VANAGON mail...

Won't Get Fooled Again (The Who)
   [I always called this &quot;the highway-hypnosis song&quot;, because one local FM
station *always* played it at about 2:15am, and I would get to hear it at
just about the same place on my drive home every night.]

The version of &quot;Hot Rod Lincoln&quot; that I'm familiar with was done by
Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen.  I've always considered this to
be the very first &quot;rap&quot; song...
