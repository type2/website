i am also looking for the &quot;older style&quot; (i.e. the seat doesn't slide on
runners) 
drivers style seat for a 59 walk thru bus. all seat conditions considered but

would like to find a nice one
-------

i say take what you can find- these are hard to get.    I have only found one
of these, which was from Moselle, a 61 walk through micro.    Mike sold her
to Joe, who sold her to Jakin, who sold her to some guy who put a motor in
her.  Also put in other seats.  We found the seat in a junkyard on the
Olympic penninsula, which was odd to find familiar bits from a bus you drove
around for a couple years.  anyway, the seat went to Jeff Slater, for his
double door walk througfh 61 delivery van.     The seat had gotten pretty
ratty, but he was glad to get it.

I think that design is awful, myself, as the driver does NOT sit behind the
steering wheel, but slightly to the side, which can give you a crick in the
back like all get out.  I'm not too impressed by the set up on the passenger
side of the later (63-67) walk through, either.  (maybe it's worse for me as
my back is still messed up from being run into in November)  That's my own
personal biased opinion, and i'm not driving any walk through buses anymore.
 I'd unload the bus on someone else.
