Subject:      Fridge not Working on Propane

Hey folks,

I have what may turnout to be a simple question. But before I go tearing
things apart I thought I bounce the question of ya'll! When using our
fridge on the last couple of road trips I noticed that the weakest of the
power sources was the propane. In fact, last weekend it did not even seem
to work at all on propane.

So this past week I did the logical testing of each source of power, well
actually I have not tried running on battery since the trip (seemed to work
fine). When I set the fridge to outside electrical hookup overnight it was
able to freeze water! However, when I set it to propane (yes I followed the
directions on how to do so), nada! The fridge warmed right up to room temp.
I thought maybe I was out of propane, but the stove seems to work just
fine, thus propane!

Any suggestions????

Chris
