Subject: Re: How much is that Beetle in the window?

&gt;1959 Beetle  $35.00  Good Body, no engine.(local kids stomped its roof in)

OUCH! A '59, no less! I bet that one comes back and haunts you from time to
time! ;-)
BTW, this Beetle wouldn't have been trounced upon back in the '60's, would
it? (I've got a picture of my girlfriend's Dad stomping on a 1959 Beetle.)
Could this be the same one, or was that just something people did for fun
back then? Could it be that TWO '59 Beetle were trashed!?! Say it ain't so!!!
