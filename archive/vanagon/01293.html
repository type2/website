Subject: Re: 81 Vanagon Swaybar


Several years ago my '81 broke the drop link on the driver side.
Then the replacement broke.  Then the replacement-replacement broke
on the way home from the dealer!  (I heard it as I turned a corner
in my neighborhood that has a gutter that rocks the van.)

Then the passenger side broke!  Finally an investigation showed
that the driver side was in backwards--that transfered the stress
to the other one.  Whew!

Careful measurement by the dealer led them to suggest that the
lower suspension piece (where the drop link connects) was bent
slightly.  I got another one from Recycle VWs, the drop links
were replaced and I haven't had a problem.

This was all ~3+ years ago.  I figure I bent the sucker trying
to punch the Vanagon up jeep roads like I did with my earlier
buses.  Hey--I got up 'em!

So if you break them on one side, check that suspension arm.  If
you break them on both, maybe my experience is of no use....
