Subject: Re: 68 vw bus $550 runs &amp; looks great (Concord, Bay Area)


Welllllllllll, I took a look at it tonight.  I am not sure what to think.
The interior is not cool but he did tell me that before I made the trek so
I was not disappointed there.

The engine has a case number of B5XXXXXXXX  Can anyone identify that for
me?  Is this a Brazilian Bug block?  The lid did say it had been rebuilt
13k ago but it sounded kinda rough.  It kept dying at first and then he got
it to idle but I was a bit uneasy about it.

The electrical seemed good and the clutch/tranny were fine.  The steering
was way rough.

The cargo section under the rubber was major rusty.  It looks like it was a
delux with all the chrome trim but....

I dunno.  I have said I would not be able to pick it up until Sat so I am
kinda mulling it over.  ON THE OTHER HAND he had a 1970 Dk Blue Beetle that
was in pretty nice condition for $2500 but that is out of my budget so I
mention it for other listers.

I await your comments.  Again it is a 1968 for $550

&gt;&gt;I have may end up being a parts bus.  Anyhoo, will let you know either way.
&gt;
&gt;In my experience, a baywindow that's anywhere near that condition--
&gt;or even noticably worse as long as it runs-- that is going for that price,
&gt;will be bought real quickly. Good luck!
&gt;
&gt;If I were you, I'd:
&gt;
&gt;(a) Make sure it's still there, and
&gt;(b) Check with Higher Authority (the one you cited) on whether a &quot;parts
&gt;bus&quot; qualifies as &quot;another bus&quot;. Else it may become &quot;another domicile&quot;.
