Subject: Re: '78 Westy refrigerator

Junk it!

The camping interior of the '78 is well-designed except for that piece of 
&amp;*($%.

I (and others I know) have ripped out the guts of the fridge and now use 
the two bins for storage (there's lots of room in there!) A cooler (or 
chest fridge) behind the passenger seat is easily accessible and makes a 
great bench for working in the kitchen...
