Subject: Re: VW America denies recall

The only experience I've had with recalls is on my my '85 Jetta. I 
heard about a heater core recall, and took the car to the dealer in 
'92 asking about it. They gladly checked that it had not been done, 
and replaced it free of charge. I was the 2nd owner, the car had 
~200k kms on it, and had not seen dealer service for at least 2-3 
years, but they did not even ask. 

&gt; I know this won't make you feel better, but to my knowledge the VW customer
&gt; service line has NEVER acknowledged any recall of ANY kind for any car.
&gt; Many on the Corrado list have called about recalls and have gotten
&gt; stonewalled.
&gt; 
&gt; But take heart!  Persistance can sometimes be rewarded, I have heard that
&gt; there are times when the area reps are pushed hard enough they relent, and
&gt; even the customer service jerks will help out, but with something as big as
&gt; total loss due to fire it may take some doing.
&gt; 
&gt; First you need to get documentation of the recall either from the NTHSA or
&gt; from a local dealership.  Then you must establish that the recall work was
&gt; never performed (the dealer might be able to find out that info). Then get
&gt; to the area rep, and pressure him.  (play up the safety angle).
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps a little.  Good Luck
&gt;
