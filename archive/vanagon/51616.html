Subject: Re: (Fuel filter) What a Long Strange Trip It's Been

&gt;The small filter before the fuel pump was recalled on my 86GL leaving
&gt;only the big silver one after the pump.  Something about only needing
&gt;the small one for manufacturing debris.  I think the small one also
&gt;leaked, another reason to do without.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know about your years, but mine was a definite recall item.

Same with my '87 - dealer service recall.
