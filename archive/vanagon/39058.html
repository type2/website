Subject: List Stickers and Grateful Dead (This is a collector's item)


To Richard Palmer:  Sorry for EVER suggesting that you did wrong on the 
stickers....

To the Rest of the List: That's TWICE in two days I've EVER appologized for
anything....put a copy of this post away in a safe place, it may be worth 
money due to its rare nature!   8)


To the Issue of Main Concern...The Grateful Dead, Hippies, Drugs and VW 
Vans..

QUESTION: My three year old son Alex has the following symptoms:
1. He loves the Grateful Dead - he will even request &quot;Terrapin Station&quot; when 
we are driving in the EV.

2. He can identify: Split Window Vans, Oval Window Bugs, VW vans in general 
and EuroVans

3. Is now asking to help work on my EV and Oval Bug


Should I start looking for joints, roaches, and other drug related stuff in 
his toy box?

A concerned VW Van parent..

Ric
