Subject: Re: westy propane question

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can anyone tell me if it's safe to drive a westy with the propane
&gt;&gt; on for the refrigerator?  I know that one has to turn it off while
&gt;&gt; tanking up, but RV's all keep propane on while driving, so I'm 
&gt;&gt; wondering if this applies to the campers as well....
Probably no problem, even if the flame goes out, because everythings vented.
But what if there's an accident, and a propane line springs a leak?  I'd
rather depend on not keeping the 12V on while driving, and not opening the
door often.

&gt;Well...*I've* done it since the refrigerator is such a pain to light up, even 
&gt;with '85 that had the auxiliary battery. Which battery saved the main battery
&gt;IF you happened to forget, and left the fridge running on 12v.
My 12V does not appear to draw too much with the engine off. i.e., I've
always been able to start the engine, but then, I never leave it overnight...
&gt;
&gt;I NEVER had the flame go out, even in crosswinds and near horizontal deluge, 
&gt;while driving...
&gt;
&gt;Turning it off while tanking? Why? What property of the propane burner 
&gt;in the recesses of the refrigerator cabinetry makes it dangerous in 
&gt;a fill-up situation? Considering the flash point of gasoline, I would 
&gt;consider it more hazardous to start a vehicle than continue the refrigerator
&gt;flame...
It's not the flash point of gasoline, but the flashpoint of the vapour.  A
flame will definitely ignite the gas fumes.  OTOH, the fill is on the
opposite side of the van from the fridge.  OTOH, what about the guy next to
your fridge?  I think that the most dangerous situation would be when
filling the propane tank... but since I don't ever leave the gas on while
driving, I don't have to remember to turn it off when I fill any fuel.
