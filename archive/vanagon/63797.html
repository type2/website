Subject: Manual transmission Q's

Hi all:

Last week my transmission started making a howling or whining noise (not 
too bad yet) in 1st and 2nd gear.  Not surprising since the trans has 
more than 200,000 miles on it.

Anyway, a few questions:

Any experience or anectdotes about how long from the time you start 
hearing these noises until the trans self-destructs?

It doesn't seem likely that changing the trans oil, even to a heavier 
weight, would much improve things.  Anybody have any contrary opinions?

I guess rebuilding these things is beyond the realm of possibilities for 
the home mechanic, so does anybody have a good recommendation for trans 
rebuilders in the SF Bay Area?
