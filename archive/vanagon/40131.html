Subject:       Re: Screwed at the pump! Was: Re: gasoline prices

&gt; Unleaded =  $1.459/gal
&gt; Mid-grade = $1.569/gal
&gt; Premium =   $1.669/gal

&gt; I've never seen them this high in my life.
&gt; End of gripe.

Holy cow!  That's insane!  $1.66 a gallon.  I was going to complain 
about our prices in SLC, but I guess $1.25 for cheapo unleaded isn't 
bad at all...
