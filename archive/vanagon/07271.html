&gt; &quot;Be-Here-Now&quot; philosophy?  Is that a Muirism or what?  If so, I don't recall that
&gt; one.  Must be gettin' old.... ;)


   More likely the opposite - The book &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, the contents of which I 
   do not actually remember - a girlfriend MADE me read it - appeared in the
   late 60's or early 70's. Muir appeared for the first time around then too, 
   didn't he? He might of been into it.

   I have AC in other vehicles, but seldom use it- It is not for claustrophobes
   like myself. Besides, if you're driving an air-cooled VW and it is REALLY
&gt;  hot outside, you need to know - and show some sympathy towards the old 
   powerplant, right?


   So what is the desert without the heat?
