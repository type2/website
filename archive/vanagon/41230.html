Subject: re: EV oil change

ahh yes, the dreaded EV oil change.  This is a job that screams for a lift.
The engine cover is designed to release and hang by those two &quot;arms&quot; at the
rear, and being able to stand under  the EV would provide easy access to the 
filter.  So much for dreaming.  I've done it about 8 times now and I think 
I have it just about down pat.  Still takes a good 15 minutes to get the front
jacked up, on stands, the cover removed and pulled out, and the filter removed.
Definitely get the socket and an extension.  I can't think of any other way to
do it.  Even doing all that, the filter's almost impossible to see, and 
installing the new one is done entirely by feel.

When I bought the EV, I was hoping accessing the filter would be as easy 
as on my 5 cyl. Quantum (by far the easiest I've ever done).  Just the
opposite, I'm afraid.  While you're under there, take a look around.  Lots
of interesting stuff.

Anybody change the gas filter yet?  They sure didn't leave much extra rubber
hose in case you need to trim it back - grrr.
