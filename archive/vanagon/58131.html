Subject: Re: .. Diesel problems

&gt;&gt;      I am still having trouble with my 82 diesel.  It is not reving up
&gt;&gt;under load, ther is air geting into the fuel (Ican see it in the clear line,
&gt;&gt;it is most visible when I turn the engine off) I am deting ready to replace
&gt;&gt;the line from the tank to the filter, does that sound reasonable?
&gt;
&gt;My experience with not reving up under load, was a clogged fuel filter,
&gt;I did not notice any air bubbles in the line at the time.  It would seem 
&gt;that an air leak could cause similar trouble. Did you check at the
&gt;fuel filter, possibly the small brass screw that is loosened when you
&gt;drain water out the bottom of the fuel filter?  or the water drain?
&gt;
My guess is that you are probably having a slightly hard time starting in
the morning. The bubbles in the line do indicate air getting in. The
symptom of only seeing them when the engine is shut off tells me that the
shaft seal on the pump is leaking. It's an easy repair, if you have the
tools to re time it, and if you can find a seal. There is a diesel pump
rebuilding shop a couple hundred mile from me. I just call them up and tell
them the type of pump I'm working on and they UPS the seal to me. Used to
cost about five bucks plus shipping. You have to be real careful removing
the old seal. The shaft is hard and a little bit forgiving of being
scratched but you don't want to take any chances. HTH
