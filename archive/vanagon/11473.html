Subject: Re: crank bearing removal

&gt;I need to remove the #3 main bearing from the Bus crankshaft.  However,
&gt;I am without a press of any sort.  Anybody know a trick, using common
&gt;household appliances or rocks, on how to remove this bearing?
&gt;
Dave- I've used a craftsman puller, with a 6 in. range to do the trick.  
Life is made easier if you make an jig to hold the crank.  heat helps too.
