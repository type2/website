Subject: Sagging rear on 71 bus


My '71 bus sits kind of low in the rear, even while empty. I've been
told that this may be the result of worn rear torsion bars. I have several
questions:

1.) Are the rear torsion bars in a '71 bus adjustable? If not, can they
be made so? Would this just postpone the inevitable?

2.) How difficult is it to replace rear torsion bars in a '71 bus? Has
anyone out there actually DONE this? Any hints or tips?

3.) Anyone ever put coil-over shocks (with helper springs), or air shocks,
on a bus like this? Where can I find them? I've seen both for bugs, but
not for buses. JCWhitney has them for bugs only. Any help would be much
appreciated!
