Steve --among others-- is apparently working very hard to make it to the
top of the next statistics... :) So, in a desperate attempt to remain among
the top 20 big-mouths, here's my question/comment of the day:

Brian said:
&gt;I think this contraption is the same thing I saw in my local marine shop.
&gt;It is an electric cooler/heater. Looks like a coleman. It isn't any heavier
&gt;than a coleman either. Will keep things cold or hot! Plugs in to a 
&gt;cigarette lighter. Uses very little power (they say).
&gt;
&gt;Pretty nice. This one even came with a slidein tray that allows you to
&gt;turn it on its side to make it work like a fridge. I think it cost a
&gt;$100. I contemplated ripping out the fridge in my camper and installing
&gt;one of these in its place. Might be more practical.

I had the same idea. (BTW, I cut out the ad from a magazine but then lost it.
Does anyone have a phone#?) Anyway, I'd like to replace my non-working
fridge with this contraption, but would like to keep the propane stove
above. So there might be 2 solutions: either hope that the koolatron is
small enough to fit in place of ye olde fridge, OR transplant the
cooling mechanism/plumbing of the koolatron only. 

Do those who now own one think that this is possible? Also, would you know
its outside dimensions?

Thanks,

Sami
