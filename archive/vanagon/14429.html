Subject: Heater/Ventilation Questions

I have 2 questions,

1.Regarding the rear heat system located under the bench seat in an '85 
Westy.  For the first time, we used this to get some outside air 
circulating in.  The fan or blower makes this loud clickity clackity 
noise.  How do you access the fan/blower to lubricate or correct this, or 
is this noise somewhat normal?

2. There is virtually no air coming from the fresh air vents above the 
sliding passenger compartment door.  Plenty of fresh air comes in from 
the front vents, any ideas?  Thanks!
