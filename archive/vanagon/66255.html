Chris

Thanks a ton for your quick reply.
Joel Walker gave me you name and I dont know about a westy mailing list
but the vanagon mailing list address is Vanagon_at_GERRY.SDSC.EDU
This is where i posted my question about heaters and joel replied to it.

Hearing your response on the propex heaters may have me convinced that
that could be the way to go.  I moved into the van several months ago and
spending a litte $$ to avoid a lot of hassle and discomfort seems like a
good thing.

I will call the england line and get some info but if i have more
questions it would be really nice to be able to give to a call.

Thanks again

Blake
