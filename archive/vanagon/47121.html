Chris,

The service at Alamden RV in San Jose was fast and reliable.  Contact 
Chris was very helpful.  I purchased my Westy in March and the frig 
did not light.  Chris took out the frig and fixed the clogged burner 
for only $97.00. Chris' number is 408-448-1652.  He is really busy and 
has a 2 week backlog.

We just came back from a nine trip up the California coast and back. The 
frig worked great. 

Regards

Duane Phelps
