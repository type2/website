With all this exhaust system talk I guess I might as well get some
help too.  My 85 needs it all.  The front pipe has broken off at the
connector pipe, and the catalytic is broken off at the connector
pipe.  The muffler looks like swiss cheese and the tailpipe has been
gone for five years.  Some of us don't live in CA.

Well, I've patched, taped and plugged and have just adjusted to
running with loud straight exhaust.  Course the oxy sensor really
isn't get enough to sniff so it runs peculiar.

Well the dealer wants about $1,700 to do all the parts.  The Parts
Place in Detroit has all the parts but my favorite mechanic says
their stuff is junk.  Do any of you folks have a good source for all
three pipes, the converter, muffler and tailpipe?
