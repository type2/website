&gt; &gt; Mark (1980 was a good year for America)
&gt; 1980 in the United States (Canada, Mexico, and the rest are America, too) I 
&gt; get vaguely sick to my stomach and pale.
In 1980, Mark was a hero to America, and perhaps the rest of the world.
Who knows ... what will a historian looking back in say 50 to 100 years say
about what Mark contributed to the safety and peace that the world now starts
to enjoy.  More than that, to me Mark has been and continues to be a friend
and helpful.
If you don't know what I'm talking about, do some literature research.  You'll
find it.
