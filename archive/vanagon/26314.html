Subject: Tags on Eurovans? Mine does not fit!

Hi all,

I just recieved my tag, from the dealer and the holes don't even come 
close to the mounting holes in the Eurovan.

Has anybody else had this problem?  Do I have to buy or make a special 
bracket to hold my tag on?  Or should I just punch new holes in the tag 
to make it fit?

Please help,
