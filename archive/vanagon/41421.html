&gt;Working on the '69 Westy this weekend try8ing to put the windows back in.
&gt;Got rubber on the window glass.  Tried to put it back.  It does not want to
&gt;go.  I don't mean just the interior lip.  I mean the whole top half of the
&gt;friggin' window!  We beat on that thing for close to 2 hours and STILL
&gt;could not get it all the way in.  How does one install windows?  Am I
&gt;missing something?

Lubricate the rubber with vaseline or silicine spray.  Make sure the spray
you use is ruber safe.
