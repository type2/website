Subject: /f Re: VW-Vanagon Mailing List Split?

Fortunately it sounds like the water cooled engines are disintegrating at 
an incredible rate, so the air cooled engines will outlive them and solve 
the problem... I read that VW is going back to manufacturing '76 campers 
exclusively and forgetting the EuroVan nonsense to boot... : ' )
