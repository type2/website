Don't have a Vanagon (yet - workin' on it!) but I think I might be able 
to offer you some advice, as this problem popped up back in July in my

In my car, the temperature needle ran warmer or colder than normal, 
despite the fact that it was August in Austin, TX which meant that the 
problem probably wasn't cold-related. A friend advised me that the 
problem was probably related to the thermostat, and it would probably 
need replacing -- a repair which, at the dealer, cost me about $80.

The thermostat, like the one in your house, regulates the running 
temperature of the engine. If it is malfunctioning, your engine might be 
running at other than nominal temperature, even if nothing is actually 
wrong with it. You might want to have this checked at a local repair shop 
or by another VW lover near you. It's much, much cheaper than having your 
engine replaced.
