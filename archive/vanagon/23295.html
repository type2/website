&gt; Dad:  Because you have to 'fly' the tranny shaft in there.  (said with a
&gt; straight face)
&gt; Grandfather:  Because a pilot is a guide.  It guides the mainshaft into
&gt; alignment with the clutch.  (And threw a greasy rag at my dad, who caught it,

Makes me think of what the Simpsons would do/say...
Sorry, very little VW content.

Bart:	Why do they call it a pilot bearing?

Marge:	I don't know Bart, but mind you don't get your hands greasy.

Homer:	Mmmmmm.  Grease.

Grampa:	Well, Back in the war, the big one, you see, the pilots
	flew planes, now these planes weren't like the ones you 
	have today, no no no, they didn't have these stealthy
	bombers and Harriet Jump suit jets and such, they had
	biplanes.  They used to tie an onion to their belts, it
	was the style then, you see, and these pilots, you see,
	they...   &lt;Snore&gt;
