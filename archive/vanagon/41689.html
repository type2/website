Subject: Guages

    Hello everyone.
 The guages I installed in my Vanagon came from JC whitney.  Most places I
checked only had guage trios.
I also ordered the adapter kit for imports.  This supplies the bushings to
install the NPT senders in to the meteric ports.  I mounted the oil pressure
sender nest to the coolent reservoir and ran a plastic tube down to the oil
switch between the #2 and #4 cylinders.  I used a tee to tie in the line so
the switch is still functional.  I used a tee to tie the temperature sensor
in to the thermastat housing.  The ampmeter is only partly functional.  It
only reads discharge.  Thealtenator is tied to the starter power cable.  it
would be difficult to make the ampmeter work for charging.  

     Thank you to all who gave suggestions on wheel bearing sources.  I
still need to pull the bearings and get a number.  I think I am going to get
them from a local bearing distributor.  When I get the numbers  I will post
them with the numbers and price of the new part.

Thanks again.
