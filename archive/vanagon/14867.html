&gt; assuming breadloaf=Bay window, I have a breadloaf. I wave at every damn 
&gt; air-cooled I see. I guess I'm a waving fool, and I'm not really that 
&gt; friendly of a guy. (Hell I even waved at a dune buggy the other day).

I always wave at every transporter I see, and usually at any flat four.
I've tried waving at EVs but almost never get a positive response.

Anyway, the other day, lying on my back &quot;bench pressing&quot; my front end
(with the help of my coils) trying to determine the location of the new
squeak, I heard the lovely music of a 1600 aproaching.
I crawled out to see a beautiful little green Ghia 'vert pulling up.
The owner, who I've passed on the street and waved to a few times, asked 
if I needed help or anything.  I said no but thanked her anyways.
Now if I hadn't waved at her a few times in the past, would the driver
of a very nice Ghia offer help to a complete... nay compleat stranger
under an 85 Vanagon? I dunno, But waving may have it's benifits.
(she's also seen me in a 71 super, so she knows I'm not just a clueless
H2O owner.  :))
