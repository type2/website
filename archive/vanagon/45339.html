Subject: Re: Request for .009 timing measurments


&gt;Does someone have the measurements [inches or cm] from 0
&gt;on a stock-sized crank pulley for 7.5 and 30 BTDC? I seem
&gt;to remember 7.5&quot; being about 3/8&quot; to the left of 0.

Measuring on a stock-sized degree wheel I never have installed:

7.5 degrees =  .45&quot; or
                3/8&quot; or
                11 mm

30 degrees =   1.75&quot; or
               1 3/4&quot; or
               44 mm

I'm measuring as the crow flies, not rolling around the diameter.
