Subject: remove spring to replace F shock?


List members....
I'm gonna replace the shocks on my 87 syncro and after looking at bentley 
was wondering if I had to remove the spring to R&amp;R the shock?  can I just 
pass the shock by the lower control arm?
Is there clearance?

later,

relax and spin
87 syncro
