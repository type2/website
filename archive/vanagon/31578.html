Subject: Flat Spot

hey now,

i've noticed a flat spot when i first punch the accelerator on my '74 van. i'm
thinking i need to adjust the carb. kinda just sits for a second then the
engine engages. valves just been done, oil changed...timing okay. just had the
front window shield seal replaced and the van inspected (yeah yeah i know that
ain't got nothin' to do with my flat spot! :-) ) any ideas? i have a singe
weber carb. thanks!

jonathan
