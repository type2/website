Hi
I seem to be in between the air cooled and water cooled news groups. I have
a beetle fitted with a 2.1 Wasserboxer(vanagon) I currently run twin 46 ida 
Webers Berg cam and rockers 10.5 compression ratio  about 160bhp. I am 
setting up an IHI turbo with Haltec injection and water cooled intercooler 
(like the liberty) should be good for 250-300 bhp at 15psi boost. Is there 
anyone out there playing around with these also i cannot find much on the 
net about Wasserboxer/Vanagon engine..
