&gt; re DC's ideas
&gt; 
&gt; didnt take it as a flame at  all DC :-)
&gt; 
&gt; i guess i was reacting to my mbox this am - 50 posts mostly about
&gt; 'da trip' which (being one of the 20 or so interested) made me feel like
&gt; we were overusing the bandwidth of the 170 others on the list. 
&gt; Maybe they want to hear about it - i dont know, so i was raising the possibilty
&gt; that we should give them bandwidth back. If no objections then we can 
&gt; carry on  :-)

I am still trying to put together a mail alias for all of those interested
in the trip, but the list is still growing!  Up to 27 people now.  When I
finally create the alias, you all will at least be spared from *my* ranting :)
