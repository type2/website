Subject: Re: Redline Water Wetter


I used the Redline Water Wetter when I replaced the coolant after
installing a new engine.  The mechanic that replaced the engine used 100%
anti-freeze as well.  I think that the engine is running too cold.  While
replacing coolant with water when repairing leaks I would guess that I
have mabye 33% water in the system now, and the guage still very rarely
moves out of the white.  Only if I let it idle for 20 min or so will the
needle escape the white.  The needle used to always be at the redlight.  I
am going to replace the coolant without using the water wetter.  The
Vanagon just has a huge cooling system that should have no problem cooling
the engine. YMMV.

&gt; Has anyone tried this product? It is suppose to increase the heat transfer

&gt; water temp. Just curious if anyone has experience with this product.
