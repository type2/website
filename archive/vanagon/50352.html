&gt; Called my mechanic later from work and he told me had &quot;found the problem
&gt; for sure this time&quot;.  Said it was the ignition coil.  Said it had orange
&gt; spark on the plugs when it should have had blue.  I said, &quot;Great, I'll come
&gt; pick it up after work.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I fully expected my van to die on the way home like it did on Wednesday
&gt; when he had &quot;found the problem for sure this time&quot;.  Well, it DID NOT die
&gt; on th way home.  I even drove around for an extra half hour just to make
&gt; sure.  It never died!
&gt; 
&gt; Now the question for the panel?  Does anyone think that a bad ignition coil
&gt; could have caused my Vanagon to die in the way I have been describing the
&gt; past week?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still skeptical.  I feel like I have been betrayed by a loved one.  It
&gt; is going to take a long time to rebuild the trust. 
&gt; I think your mechanic may be right this time.
A defective coil will work when the engine is cold for a while.
When the engine is hot and the coil is at operating temp, the weak or
failing insulating yields and the coil loses its abilitilty to act as
an inductor, thus no sparks. When the coil cools down it will function
again since the insulation self-heals itself temporary.
&gt; The orange spark is a sign of a weak volatge.
