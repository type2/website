Subject: RE: reassemble on the tranny from long block?

Gary Shea inquires whether to assemble an 81 Vgon engine on the ground or
in the car.  I would say on the ground.  Vgon engine is low enough so that
a car on ramps is high enough to slide the engine under on a transmission
jack.  And since the transmission is on a hinge at the front, there's no
trick to getting the engine onto the trans and then up into the compart-
ment.

With taller engines like the Porsche, I do put the fan/shroud and induction
on in the car, because the completed engine is too tall to roll under the
van.

I basically never mastered the trick of getting Beetle and Thing engines in
and out.  One of the traits that originally endeared VW buses to me was the
removeable back brace on 60's buses, that made the engine so easy to remove
and install working solo.
