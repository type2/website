&gt; Hey Sean, your connection makes sense.  That pilot light is directly 
&gt; behind the driver side window area.  Mine usually stays on, but has 
&gt; occasionally gone out, could of been the window.  Presumably there is a 
&gt; safety device that shuts off the main gas feed when the pilot goes out (I 
&gt; hope, does anyone know?).  I'll experiment next time I go camping.
&gt; On the subject of pilot lights, it took a notice on a gas pump to remind 
&gt; me to shut off the pilot when fueling, I felt retarded!

Charles,
It only does it sometimes on mine as well.  It only seems to blow the
flame out if the driver's window is down and it's a windy day, and the
wind has to be blowing in the right direction :-) 

Yes, there is a thermocouple that shuts off the gas flow if the flame
goes out.  That's why lighting the fridge requires you to hold in the
safety valve button because otherwise no gas would get into the
combustion chamber because there's no flame.
