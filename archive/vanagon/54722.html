Hi Chris!

You might want to post this as a reply - 

Try using a lanolin hand cleaner/degreaser and warm water. This should take
out the gas and smell. Then wash the clothes as normal. The lanolin will not
hurt the clothes (in fact, if you look on the label, it usually says it can
be used instead of laundry detergent!). It's the only thing that ever worked
for me. I also shower with the goo if I get it on my skin. It removes the
oily gas residue that soap can't touch, as well as soothes the minor chemical
burns good gas can cause.

Hope this helps.

Frank
