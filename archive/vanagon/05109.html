&gt;So, this bears the question... Should the coolant be replaced with
&gt;fresh stuff? Or, filter and recycle back into the engine. (I've
&gt;already bought new coolant so I'm changing it anyway).

my understanding is that you NEVER put old coolant back into the car. always
use new stuff ... just like the oil (would anyone re-use their engine oil?)

and the reasoning given is that you need the new stuff (with its fresh
chemicals) to inhibit corrosion in the system (cause, after all, there IS
water in there, and water does tend to make things rust).
