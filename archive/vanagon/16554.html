Subject: RE: Mud Flaps

Sami, could you send me info on the catalog you have (or
place you said they were $35).  What a coincidence - just
yesterday I stopped by a VW dealer because my mud flaps finally
wore out and the rubber split in half (I only have them on
the front but rear mud flaps would be cool to have also).
The dealer wanted $90 each!  I laughed and walked out.

-Scott.
