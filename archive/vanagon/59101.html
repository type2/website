Hi Earl,

Wow! 27 MPG!?! In a Vanagon???

Did I miss some of this thread? Is yours a deisel?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The story so far:  about two months ago a sudden increase (or should it
be a
&gt; &gt;decrease?) in mileage from 27 mpg to 10 mpg. About a month ago, increase
of
&gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt;ten thousand percent in black smoke emission.  (Sure discourages
tail-gaters!) 
&gt; &gt;Lots of excellent advice and suggestions from you folk, change of ECU
and Temp.
&gt; &gt;sensor 2, adjustment of AFM.  Minimal improvement.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Friday, finally took it to a mechanic.  It took him three hours to
figure out
&gt; &gt;what was causing the problem and I think it was a great piece of
detective
&gt; work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Wire coming from the O2 sensor on the 84 is a single lead that plugs
into
&gt; &gt;another
&gt; &gt;lead coming out of the wiring harness.  That harness lead goes into the
&gt; multipin
&gt; &gt;connector.  For reasons known only to themselves, VW engineers made that
&gt; harness
&gt; &gt;lead a co-axial cable with the shield grounded.  Somewhere along that
lead,
&gt; &gt;inside the harness, the insulation around the inner wire broke and
allowed the
&gt; &gt;signal to ground on the shield.  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The mechanic, Niel, took endless trouble to explain the operation to me.
 Seems
&gt; &gt;at 600 degrees the O2 sensor generates a 0.5 volt signal to the
computer.  Over
&gt; &gt;that voltage indicates a rich mixture and the ECU decreases the fuel
flow.
&gt; &gt;Under
&gt; &gt;0.5 volts indicates a weak mixture and the ECU feeds in more gas.  A
grounded
&gt; &gt;wire will produce a 0.0 voltage so guess what the ECU does?!!.  Niel
simply
&gt; took
&gt; &gt;apart the multipin connector and checked the voltage at the pin, then
cut
&gt; &gt;off the
&gt; &gt;faulty lead and replaced it with a single wire lead.  Now ole Smoky
purrs like
&gt; &gt;a kitten and I am looking forward to 27mpg. again.
