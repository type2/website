The ground wire for the headlights has lost it's connection.  Probably burned 
at the connection by the fuse box.  Check the two round ground connectors.  
Both Headlights are grounded at the same terminal.  It is the one that is 
obviously overheated.

When I turn on headlights, the blue highbeams indicator is on permanently but
no headlights.  This was a rare intermittent thing that is now consistent.  A
couple of times it seems to ahve un-done itself when I jiggled and repeatedly
switched the high beams switch on the steering column, so I suspect the 
problem
is there.  Also, once, the high beam switch would cause the wipers to go on.

Any tips on what to do.  Thanks.
