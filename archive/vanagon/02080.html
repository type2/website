&gt; Micheal, shame on you for bringing up crass monetary concerns about the
&gt; price of fuel for heaven's sake.  Sure it's a bit cheaper to the
&gt; south but is it really that important? 

I kinda figured we could all drive single file *real* close together, like
they do in bike races (drafting, is that what they call it?).  I bet we
could all get 30 mpg :)
