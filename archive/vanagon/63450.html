Subject: 1985 Vanagon airflow sensor ?


I took my van into the shop (it was running rich) they popped the cover off
my 
air flow sensor and at idle the air sensing flap was jumping all around, not
steady.
Their saying this is caused by a bad intake valve. Anyone know if this is
right. 

Thanks Dave
