Subject: I got a new hat!



For my birthday (today, thanks in advance for all parts being gifted to me:-)
I received a new baseball cap.

On the front of said hat is, please pardon the implied profanity: FUKENGRUVEN

Below that is a skull with an enlarged cranium containing the VW logo.

Took me quite a while to notice the skull and that it didn't say FUNKENGRUVEN.

Subtle:-)
