Subject: Waterboxer engine swap


&gt;
&gt;Swapping a 2.1 motor into a vehicle that had a 1.9 is basically a straight-
&gt;forward deal. All the wiring still works. You need either to modify the
&gt;overflow bottle or replace it with a later model. Also the way the coolant
&gt;lines are set up it is necessary to trim some sheet metal from the firewall
&gt;on the driver's side. I am currently looking into upgrading my engine and
&gt;would prefer to install a 2.1. There just not easy to find, at least not with
&gt;reasonable low miles.
&gt;Has anybody looked into swapping in a VR6 or later model water-cooled motor?
&gt;One other note: I think the distributor from the 1.9 must be used in the 2.1
&gt;engine.  A friend of mine has gone through this swap on two of his vans, 
one an 
&gt;84 and one an 85.
