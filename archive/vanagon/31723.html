Whats the difference between a 25hp motor and a 36hp motor?
I mean besides the (duh) hp rating &amp; displacement.  

And is that bhp or SAE?

Is is something you can detect with the naked (!) eye?

How hard is it to get parts for one of these beauties?

I guess its obvious that I'm looking to add a vehicle with
this tremendous amount of horsepower to my stable...  Details
when I get the deal gelled...
