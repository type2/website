&gt; I had a total of seven people and their weights averaged about 190 pounds.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that the EV's ride  actually felt a lot cushier and I was not feeling
&gt; the cigarette butts that I drive over anymore....  The engine did not even
&gt; seem to notice the weight...

Yup.  The other weekend we had the wife and I, the 14 and 12 year old 
daughters, the 5 month old son, 6 40 lb. bags of wood pellets, 4 20 olb 
bags of cat food, 50 lbs of dog food, (we breed ferrets - ferret litter 
and food) and a whole mess of other stuff in the EV.  It was quite hot so 
we ran both A/Cs.  The van was quite 'happy'.  Don't want to hear 
anything about 'underpowered' Eurovans.

Checked with a VW dealer about a hitch for the EV.  Rated at 3500 lbs. 
costing $178 - gonna check for none VW parts but that hitch may be the 
next addition to the EV.  Might be able to 'tow' both Things with that - 
not that I expect that to be legal... :)
