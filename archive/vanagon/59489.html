Subject: re: EV parts

Try a couple of mail order parts places before commiting your cash to the
dealer for EV parts.  I would recommend Rapid Parts (914-357-6611,
saved me about $250 over dealer  on rear brake linings last year),  and 
Adirondack Auto Brokers (markaab_at_global2000_dot_net, also web site).

&gt;Has any one found part suppliers that
&gt;have/can get parts for Eurovans?
