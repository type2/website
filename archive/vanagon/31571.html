Subject: Re: where to stay when you're away?


WALMART does not discourage people from overnighting in their parking 
lots.  You'll see a lot of RVs crashing in their lots along the snowbird 
routes.  Encourages people to stay near their stores, and HEY!, they just 
might buy something.

Flat, more or less quiet, bathrooms in the store, and a security 
presence.  Not a bad deal for emergency crash-along-the-highway camping.

I wouldn't pull out the lawn chairs or BBQ or anything, though...
