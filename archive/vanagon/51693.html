&gt; 
&gt; HATCH STRUTS:  Just got a pair from Volks Cafe for $50.  I was told that
&gt; there are two strengths available and one side should have higher strength
&gt; than the other.  Peter recommended buying two heavy weight ones - I did and
&gt; I can just about do chin ups on the hatch.  So far so good!  And good
&gt; price.
&gt; 
&gt; Ask Kyle on the list to mail them to you.

Don,
I too just ordered some from Volks Cafe due to another lister's
recommendation.  Kyle told me that VW made two different ones for
different side, with one side being stronger, but exterior is the same.
So he said Volks Cafe only sells the strong ones (right side, I think)
and that the installation of 2 right side struts will be 4 times as
strong as the stock right-left combo.  I obviously ordered a pair :)
