&gt;How bout it ?

&gt;&gt;Houghton-Mifflin publishing company is giving books to children's
&gt;&gt;hospitals; how many books they give depends on how many e-mails
&gt;&gt;they receive from people around the world.  For every 25 e-mails they
&gt;&gt;receive, they will give one (1) book. All you have to do is e-mail:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;                            share_at_hmco_dot_com
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;and type a message saying &quot;children's hospitals book drive program&quot;.
&gt;&gt;Hope you can spare a few seconds ... let your friends know.  So far
&gt;&gt;they've only received 3,400 messages ... last year they got 23,000. I
&gt;&gt;think it would be great if we could kick it up to 30,000 . Please
&gt;&gt;forward
&gt;&gt;this mail to ANYONE you know. Thanks for your help.


&gt;From the http://www.hmco_dot_com/ web site:

     Thanks to you, the Internet community, we have reached our goal
     of 50,000 messages and Houghton Mifflin Interactive has donated
     2,000 books to hospitalized children who can't be home for the
     holidays. In recognition of the amazing and voluminous show of
     support from people all over the world, HMI has sent an additional
     500 books to these children. As of January 1, 1997, the campaign
     is officially over and we've closed the Share the Spirit inbox
     on this web site as well as the mailbox for share_at_hmco_dot_com.

PLEASE, do research before posting this sort of stuff.
