A couple of digests ago, someone mentioned a photo of a 4x4 breadloaf
going up a hill. I have a photocopied article in german about the history
of the various van types and it has a wee photo of such a 4X4. I looks
very macho. The article also has a photo of a vanagon syncro speeding
across a dusty road (desert?) with bush bar and fuel/water cans strapped
to the outside. 

I have noticed the same lack of traction of vanagons vs. breadloafs. I
attribute it to the &quot;more&quot; 50/50 weight dist. on the newer van. It does
stress the importance of good tires.
