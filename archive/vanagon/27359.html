&gt; So I take it these are 94mm pistons, the same used in 2.0 liter engines
&gt; (the 1.8 liter engine has 93mm pistons). Went back to the old paperwork
&gt; (which is complete), but saw no evidence of the pistons having ever been
&gt; replaced, even though the last rebuild required a new (rebuilt by VW of
&gt; Canada) shortblock. Very odd.
&gt; 
&gt; Will check some more serial numbers tonight. One more tidbit: the gap of
&gt; the upper ring is 0.070&quot;, i.e., *twice* the tolerance limit for old rings.
&gt; Could someone have fitted 94mm pistons with 93mm rings? Mmmh...
&gt; 
 
 My experience with VW of Canada rebuilds is that they take quite a few 
 liberties with replacement parts. My 1.8 had type I cam bearings which
 eventally came apart &lt;literally&gt;, was fitted with the camshaft with the
 raised bands that indicate a cam for an auto trans &lt;although the engine
 had a flywheel, not a flex plate&gt; and was built on a 2 liter case &lt;single 
 oil pressure relief instead of dual&gt; 

 If you take a piston off of the connecting rod, you can see whether you
 have a 2 liter or not. Connecting rods for the 66mm stroke engines have 
 a balancing &quot;nubbin&quot; on the small end - 2 liter connecting rods have a
 normal radius.

 1.7 liter parts &lt;and parts that didn't change as displacement went up&gt; will
 have an 021 part number prefix. Parts unique to the 1.8 have an 022 prefix
 while parts unique to the 2 liter have another prefix which I don't know. 
 David Schwarze can probably tell us what the 2 liter prefix is since he
 has recently had 2 liter parts spread around his kitchen &lt;appropriate use
 of a kitchen, IMHO, not shared by the wife, however&gt;
