Hey all,
This is kinda off subject, but I just remembered at bug-out 34 that I
saw a late '70s Westy that had a hardwood parquet floor in the camping
area!  I had never seen anything like that before and though it was
really cool.  The finish was worn off but with some staining it would
have looked really sharp.  Anybody seen anything like this before??

Sean
