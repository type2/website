Subject: VW's rebuilt engine offer?
Last month, several folks wrote of a $2500 rebuilt engine offer by VW
covering all water-cooled vanagons.  The local dealer here says VW doesn't
offer rebuilts for these models, only &quot;new&quot; engines costing maybe $8K!

Would anyone whose dealer gave them specific info on the rebuilt offer
please give me the date, dealer name, and phone # of their source?

Thanks!   George (gruff_at_abacus.bates_dot_edu)
