&gt;&gt; 3.&gt; Does anyone know how much tire holders for the front cost?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'll leave this for someone else.

they are cheap like under $20.00 at RMMW, BUT PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT before
you go drilling all those holes to mount the carrier eh? Numerous splits I
have had in the past had the infamous &quot;spare tire&quot; holder mounted on the
front and I have cursed said PO's for doing it.

Typically having the spare in the front and drilling the holes leads to (at
the least ) four uneasthetically pleasing holes when you go to get tired
of the carrier and remove it :), or at worst a dent on the front nose when
someone backs into the front of your car and the spare tire, while
mitigating direct contact between the front of your bus and said car bumper
has the result of disapating the pressure of the impact onto the front of
your bus resulting in a very unsighly dent :P whew!

hope i made my point clear, please think about it before breaking out the
drill bit that is all i ask!
