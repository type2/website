&gt;I resent the idea that this is one persons' mailing list. If this is the
&gt;case, I'd rather not be here. I don't want to be intruding on someone's
&gt;personal territory.

Please, Ron, no! 

It was Gerry's idea, he did (and continues to do) the work. Not only the technical 
setup, but careful moderation of the boundaries which I know goes on behind the scenes. 
The result is great, an ongoing discussion that is an entertaining, useful, and friendly 
forum that has brought many of us together in the flesh, helped us to find, understand 
and fix our buses, and served to nourish hundreds of great ideas, trips and get 
togethers. All this with little flaming, no spam, and plenty of good humor. 

The list is like Gerry's virtual garage, where we can get together to check out each 
others vans, share some tips, swap some parts, tell some stories, and drink some beer 
(well, Gerry gets to drink the beer, anyway). I don't resent that it is Gerry's garage,
and I'm happy to be welcome....
