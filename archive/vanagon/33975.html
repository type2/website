&gt;put it on!   if they try to steal it they probly bend it, yuck, but dont live
&gt;in fear.  those wingnuts'll keep it on.   it might scratch yr bus' nose a
&gt;little though

just to add to the paranoia thread...

a friend of mine had  (stress the *had* part) a VW symbol on the front of
his 65', some %&amp;*(%*%(*%_at__at_!!  ripped it off by grabbing the VW sign with
their one hand and bracing their foot against the front panel for
leverage,.....

needless to say the front panel wasn't a pretty sight by the time they
finally pried off the VW sign. In some ways i think painiting a VW sign on
the bus might be less strssful that having the real thing on their and
worrying about people stealing it. It is hard to say, the decision is
ultimately yours but i would hope that if you do decide to go with the real
thing that you don't get an ulcer over it or have to arttach an alarm to it
or sumthing..
