Hi Bus people-

First of all, Joel--put me down as unknown for now.  I am currently 
busless since having sold my Competition Orange 1977 Westfalia.

Now for my real question.  I'm going to be moving to Germany for
between 6 and 12 months, and I hope to buy a Transporter over there.
Does anyone have an idea of the cost comparison between North American
and German prices for one in the 84-89 range?  I am probably not 
going to go for a Westy unless the price is really good.  I also wonder
if there is a steep discount for Diesel engined Transporters like there
is here in the US.  

Finally, has anyone ever driven a VW van of any vintage on the Autobahn?
My only reservation in getting one over there is that it will be *way*
underpowered to the point of being unsafe.

Thanks in advance.
