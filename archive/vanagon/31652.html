Subject: Stripped drain plugs


                           Tight as You Can Get It... Plus One Turn


People have been stripping-out drain plugs since God invented the things.  It
comes from not using the proper washer.  Normally, a drain plug is installed
with a crushable washer, similar to those found on spark plugs except for
being a perfect ring, capable of forming an oil tight seal when compressed.
 That's how tight they should be turned -- just enough to compress the
washer.  But if you don't replace the washer you'll have to turn it a lot
harder.  You'll have to compress what's already compressed.  If you're lucky,
and if you didn't over-tighten it the first time, you can probably use it
twice.  After that, you're dealing with a flat washer.  You may be able to
flatten it some more but you're going to be making a mess of the threads.
 Eventually you'll strip it out.

Back in the Good Old Days, whenever that was, the local VW dealer would sell
you five drain plug washers for a quarter, plus there was a new one in each
oil-change gasket set.  Change the oil, put on a new washer.  But for some
reason, a lot of people didn't change the washer until it started to leak.
 Or fell out.  Or stripped out.  

Stripping-out the drain plug hole or the bolt wasn't a big problem on early
VW engines since you could replace the sump plate.  Of course, if the thing
fell out while driving you had to replace the engine, since your oil fell out
along with the bolt.  But you had the satisfaction of knowing you'd saved the
cost of a five cent washer.

                                   Expansion Plugs

The real message of this sermon is contained in the opening paragraph.
 People have been stripping-out sump plugs since the age of steam.  And as
you may have guessed, they've come up with a variety of fixes.  The most
common fix for a stripped sump plug is an expansion plug, a rubber jobbie
that fits in the drain hole and expands when you tighten it down.  That calls
for two wrenches, one to keep the expansion plug from turning while you
expand it, but High Tech expansion plugs have a short lever -- you can hold
it with your fingers.  The quick-lube joints use the things in wholesale
quantities.

                                            Sermonette

Every real auto-parts store carries expansion plugs.  And most mechanics keep
a few of the common sizes in their tool kit for emergencies.  But the real
cure for stipped sump plugs is prevention.  Use a new washer.  Tighten to
spec.  Leave the guess-work  for the amateurs.  Or the quick-lube joints.
