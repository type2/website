 I appreciate the suggestions for helping get this van to cool properly.  I 
 followed the Bently instructions, lifted the front 15 inches, opend the rear

 resevior and bleeder valve and the front bleeder valve.  As I was bleeding
the 
 system, the temp stayed right in the middle where it belonged.  After 
 bleeding, I shut the engine off.  At this point some fluid came up out of
the 
 &quot;radiator type&quot; cap on the rear resevoir.  This may have been because I put 
 too much in.  I drove it around for a while and the temp guage stayed right
in 
 the center as I was driving but as soon as I stop for a light, the guage
rises 
 to 2/3 quickly the drops down again as I drive.  I replaced the fan switch
but 
 this did not seem to help.  Any suggestions?

Could be bad radiator (collant not flowing properly) or you are getting
combusdtion gases in the system.  Coolant expansion after shutdown should be
minimal and the second resevoir should handle it.
