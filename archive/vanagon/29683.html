Bob, 

Your message was very intriguing.  

My alternator (the 90 amp model that comes with mid to late model Vanagons)
puts out about 13.9 volts. A few months ago, you wrote to me email saying
that this voltage seemed too low and that it ought to be higher. But I
checked Bentley and it specifies that the regulator is working properly if
it is operating anywhere from 13.5 to 14.5 volts. 

I would love to turn the voltage up higher, especially since I am running a
marine battery as one of my batteries. These marine batteries require higher
voltage than normal automotive batteries to charge properly so I have been
advised I will never be able to charge them enough. 

I looked in the bentley book for any reference to the resistor you spoke of
to see if I could replace this resistor to a different value and so increase
the voltage but I didn't see any such resistor in the manual. How can I
locate the wire wound resistor in my alternator so I can increase the
voltage? Is it inside the regulator somewhere?

&gt;Derek,
&gt;
&gt;The output of most alternators can be adjusted.  The chip in the typical
&gt;Bosch/Motorla internal regulator has a range of about ten volts.  On
&gt;alternators with external regulators, such as the old Bosch I'm using,
&gt;voltage is adjusted at the regulator by simply bending the relay contact.
&gt; This provides a range of about +2 volts, more than enough to compensate for
&gt;the 1.2 volt drop if your isolator uses garden variety diodes (Schottky
&gt;diodes have a drop of only .7v.).  For a wider range of adjustment there is a
&gt;wire-wound resistor that may be changed, a smaller value giving a higher
&gt;voltage.
&gt;
&gt;I strongly recommend against using a single battery circuit.
&gt;
&gt;Some off-road racers mount a second alternator just to power the lights.
&gt; This principle could be adopted to charge your auxiliary power circuit.
&gt;
