&gt;From: hugie_at_lindy.stanford_dot_edu (John Huguenard):
&gt;to put in a bid for a more central location.  Perhaps Morro Bay?  This seems
&gt;to be about halfway between SoCal and Bay Area. (Well I guess its a little
&gt;bit further from San Diego; Sorry David) Would this exclude any
&gt;unCalifornians who might otherwise come if it were at the Red Rocks site?
Yes, it would this Zonie.  I'm planning to make Red Rocks if my job 
cooperates.  How about if we all have a long drive just this once?  
Besides, desert camping is cool.
