Subject: STOP THAT BUS !!! 

or &quot;Did you see a VW bus roll by here recently, miss?&quot;

All kidding aside, I too, had my bus do the roll thang once.
I was going to empty some trash I had in the bus so I drove to the alley
next to the dumpster, stopped the engine, pulled on the emergency but didn't
put it in 1st as usual.  While I'm standing 6ft from the ass of the bus it
starts to s.l.o.w.l.y roll...heading right at a telephone pole 10ft away.  I
dashed after it, jump in, and got my foot on the brake just as it hit the pole
at maybe 3mph.  Put a good size dent in the front bumper and put a &quot;nice&quot;
crease in the front that I've never gotten to look perfect ( I cover it
with a bra) 

I felt like a real idiot for quite some time.  Now, I carry a set of foot
long 2&quot; square metal wheel caulks fastened together with heavy rope.  If
I park on a steep hill with no curb I use them...have had no rolling since.
(knock on wood):-)
