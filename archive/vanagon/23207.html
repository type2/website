Hi all,

Just a quick post about my new muffler

The old 77' was sounding a bit loud and I noticed that there were a few 
rust holes in the muffler.  I brought it to the local shop that I trust 
to get a new one put on.  He looks at it and asks me if this is a 
California bus.  Its from Montana, anyway the previous owner had all this 
extra muffler stuff on it.  It went from the heat exchangers to a 
complete 90 degree angle back to the old muffler.  He ended up cutting 
all that off and just stuck the new muffler on the heat exchangers.  He 
wouldn't write up a labor ticket, just parts.  I guess this is very 
illegal to mess with emissions like that.  Anyway he made me take the old 
parts with me (evidence) and said I'd thank him later (its supposed to 
have much more power).  The total price: $200.00 parts and $46.00 labor 
(under the table).  Too rich for me, my trusty old 71's muffler cost 40 
bucks.  These 2.0 liters are spendy.  I'm considering trying to trade it 
for a 71' weekender a guy has for sale.

Anyway, the bus is just as loud as it was before.  He explains that these 
two little OH rings are missing between the heads and the heat 
exchangers.  Must have happened on the maiden voyage (I do remember a 
ting, ting sound on the road just south of Michigan, and the bus got a 
little louder)  These copper rings cost $5.00 and his estimate on the 
labor, about $150.00 to $200.00 or around 1.5 to 2.0 hours at $46.00 an 
hour.  He explained that to get to where the rings go a metal pan has to 
come down and other time consuming things, just to get to the area.  
again too rich for me, so I'm going to attempt it myself, soon.  He did 
say to make sure not to break any bolts, and to 
clean the exhaust ports real good.

What am I getting my self into here, I can just see breaking the bolts 
and having to drill them and retap the heads.  God, those old motors were 
a breeze.

I might trade for the 71'.  

Or if anyone is interested in a 73' (with a 77' 2.0 liter motor and trany with
 1,500 miles on the rebuilt.  3 month 
old paint job (white) westfalia poptop, sink, stove, electric fridge, new 
interior - custom.  I can't drive it loud because it looks too good to 
sound like a beater.  Oh yea, new muffler and new tires, no rust ever.  
Bought it for $3,400 and put $230.00 into tires and $246.00 into a 
muffler so I'd sell it for $3,850.  Plus VDO oil presure and temp gauges 
(not installed, yet) They were around $150.00 from bus boys, i'll throw 
them in for free.

But I'll most likely keep her, my wife actually likes the bus.  I'm just 
frustrated by the complexity of the motor, fuel injected and all that.

enough complaining for now

Dave.
