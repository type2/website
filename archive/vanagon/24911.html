&gt; Why do you say that? How is it worthless?  I have cruise on my 1.9L with 
&gt; manual and I'm very happy with it.

I agree with Gerry.  I'm totally lazy these days and use my cruise control
all the time on the highway.  I tap it off on significant inclines and
resume when on the straight away again.  I also have a manual and would
only have considered the automatic if my regular commute would include
alot of stop-and-go traffic.
