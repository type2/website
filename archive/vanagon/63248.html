To Tom Via Ron:

My 86 westi ran for 6 months before I took it into a service site and when
they went to do a tune up they told me I didn't have one(o2 sensor) PO(SPO)
had exhaust changed and new pipes didn't have a spot for the sensor, must
have been one of those &quot;hey Marty, whets this thing for..... dunno jimmy,
couldn find a place for it, must not need it&quot;.

The condition on the van got worse as the time went on for gas mileage
dropping down to 250km per tank of gas(1.6km/mile) after adding a sensor,
and having the o2 level set by a shop that could measure it now we get
550-600km per tank of gas!

So the big question is &quot;why not have an o2 sensor&quot;

As so many people have said before &quot;always suspect the o2 sensor&quot;

The short after the long of it is by not having the new sensor, I paid 2x
for it in the gas I had to waste to keep running.
