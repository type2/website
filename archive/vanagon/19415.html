&gt; I am helping a friend to replace the pushrod tube seals on his '81 
&gt; Westy.  When he pops the valve cover bail off of the left side it hits
&gt; the catalytic converter and won't let him get the cover off.  So we 
&gt; are wondering what needs to be removed to do this.  Does the exhaust 
&gt; have to come off or at least part way?  He says the Bentley is no help
&gt; in the matter.  He is on the way to the store now to buy an idiot 
&gt; book.  This is all I know.  He is half a continent away from me.  I 
&gt; can't check my Muir from work and I figured someone here might have a
&gt; few things to watch for on this.  Ok, thanks for any help.  Jim

Not sure if this will work cause I can't see it, but I have a similar
problem which I get around by pulling the wire bale off from the side.
I just put a screwdriver under it right where it goes into the engine
and pry outward until that side pops out - then you can release the
other side and the valve cover will just fall off. =)
