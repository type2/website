&gt; Under normal conditions the front and back plates of the VC are rotating at

&gt;  With the front DS disconnected the front plates will not turn at all. The
&gt;  faster the van goes, the greater the speed differential between the front 
&gt; and
&gt;  rear plates, the greater the heat build up. Finally the VC either melts or
&gt;  explodes .

I don't think so.  The plates that are normally connected to the DS will be
turned through the VC fluid at the same rate as the plates connected to the
front diff.  There will be almost no resistance stopping them (the &quot;rear&quot;
plates) from turning, so they should be easily &quot;pulled&quot; along.

&gt;  Corollary: We go to great lengths to ensure a &lt;5% diference btwn. front
and
&gt;  rear rolling radii. Disconnecting the DS leads to a major violation of
this
&gt;  rule.

In this situation above, both are forced to rotate at different speeds.  In
the &quot;no DS&quot; example, one set is not &quot;forced&quot; at all, but allowed to be
rotated by the other set of plates.
