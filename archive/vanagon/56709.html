Converting the engine of a Vanagon to a 5 cyl. I had
some thoughts about additional gauges.

The AUDI 200 I disassembled had a tach including a
vacuum meter (econometer) which fits the right hole
of the Vanagon instrument board. I will add the tach
and will lose the fuel level indicator and water temp
gauge.

The AUDI had this gauges on a third place in the
instrument board, but in the Vanagon there is no space
for this. I planned to add a separate console for this,
but this all looking odd and I will lose the place for
the road maps between the two instrument covers on
left and right side of the dash board. Now I have this
gauge for sale: water and oil temp gauge, fuel indicator.
This all three fits the right hole of the Vanagon
instrument board.

I'm going to design a three bar indicators which will
fit the center of the instrument board below the
funny blinking colored LEDs. They will show the three
levels I stated above with 10 LEDs each, but in fact,
they are multi purpose. Below this three vertical bars
I found a small digital clock which fit the place.

The driver I like to use is the National LM3914N, and it
will show a dot or a bar as indicator. The brightness
of the LED are adjustable. Flashing is possible when
reaching a certain level.

In case of the fuel indicator I like to have the whole
bar turn into red when reaching the reserve, and to
to have an expanded range in this case. This is possible
with a two colored LED.

Because I have to do the design anyway, I like to part
with the list. I will do it in three ways:
 - publishing the design
 - offering printed boards
 - offering ready assembled gauges
But I'm in the beginning and this will take some time.

Please send me your suggestions and if you are
interested.
