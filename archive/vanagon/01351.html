&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For the time being, don't ask.  If you know how to use gopher and want to 
&gt; see what state of disarray the gopher is in today, go ahead and connect, 
&gt; but if you don't know how to use gopher, I'm not going to tell you much 
&gt; until I get it working right, and it ain't working right now.  I'll post 
&gt; something, but I'll have to wait until after Friday ...  &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
Okay, fine, be that way.  I already have enough gophers in my yard 
anyway.  ;)
