It is a whole day job if you have never done it before.

&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;The blower fan in the dashboard (vent, defog, etc...) makes a terrible
&gt;noise.  It's intermittant and varies between a quiet squeaking to a 
&gt;constant, irritating, squeal.
&gt;
&gt;I assume that the fan needs to be replaced (or maybe just lubricated).
&gt;
&gt;What I'm interested in, is how much work is involved in getting at
&gt;and replacing the fan?  I've read somewhere on the list that it's
&gt;not an easy job to remove the dashboard.  Is the fan behind the dash
&gt;or can I reach it from underneath?  I have a VW mechanic friend who
&gt;said he could replace it for $200, but I'd rather do it cheaper.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
