A common construction adhesive, available in any hardware store
nasty smelling brown goopish crap that will stick just about
anything to anything but is made for gluing up panelling, gluing
down flooring prior to nailing, etc.  Comes in small foil tubes
or standard caulk gun tubes, also nice to glue foam insulating
sheet up inside a bay behind the interior panels, not exactly OEM
specified but it sure does work.
