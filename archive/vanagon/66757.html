Subject:      Re: Yes, another but different tire question

Hi Mark,

Yes, the tire pressures of 39 front/48 rear were taken off the door jam
placard. I thought they were higher than what I've seen on my previous
Westy's. But who's to question the VW authority!?!?! :&gt;)

BTW: The tires on my '86 Westy are: Michelin MXL LT 195/75-14 with a max
load pressure rating of 50 lbs.
