Subject: a REAL basic electronics question 

Well, I guess I shouldn't feel that bad about this posting as the previous
person with a &quot;basic&quot; electronic question said he must have been asleep
during his wiring class in high school.  Well, about as technical we ever got
was making a shovel in shop class.  (It did have a nice handle I ground
me'self off the lathe)   Anyway, was wondering if someone could give me some
basic advice on a simple project.  I want to install a radio into the van
because the PO's one got ripped off.  It was the desirous Blaupunkt.  Anyway,
I figured this would be a simple hook up of existing wires but I've run into
some unidentifiable wires.  For example, my radio has one red wire for power
but when I look at the hot wire from the van it is three wires leading into a
wire harness.  What might three wires be doing here?  Is one of them a
neutral, the other a ground, etc.?  Or are the other two here for moral
support?  Can I simply wire all 3 together into the red one?  Also, the
speakers have two wires each coming from the van and the radio has, of
course, only one for each speaker.  I originally thought this was a ground
for each speaker but someone said this could be a &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; connection.
 Huh?  &quot;Oh, okay, no problem&quot;  Anyway, any advice would be helpful once you
stop laughing at the simpicity involved here. 

 Remember, install (or pay someone to install) your radio and you'll forever
be hungry, teach someone to install their own and they will never go hungry
again....

or something like that.  Actually, I seem to remember something about fish
being in that quote.....

Thanks,

Rich
