Subject:      RE: introduction?

well, since it might be of some small interest, perhaps us olde pharts on
the list should let some of the newbies and lurkers know just who or what
is hiding out there in the deep dark Email Forest.

i'm Joel Walker. It's not as much fun as being Donald Trump, but i don't
get sued nearly as much. i live in Tuscaloosa (pronounced Took-a-looka),
Alabama (pronounced Ahm-a-bala) and work for a crummy little two-bit state
football team that has a university tied to its shoestrings. :)

currently, i'm driving a 1988 Vanagon GL with 94,000 miles on it. previous
cars of note were 1971 bus, 1968 Double-cab Pickup, 1973 bus, 1980 vanagon L,
1986 vanagon GL, 1991 vanagon GL automatic, 1974 porsche 914, 1969 squareback,
and many beetles (the first car i ever drove was a unknown-year beetle with
semiphore turn signals. :)

i do most of the minor maintenance and stuff on the bus, and when i have to
get something semi-major done, i drive 200 miles to atlanta, ga, to get the
only dealer within reach that i feel like i can trust. and it doesn't hurt
that georgia has a lottery now ... so i can buy some tickets. :) but one
trip to the service dept. sure kills the hell outa one day. :(

what else? well, i'm about 700 years old ... at least it feels that way.
this body in this lifetime is only (only?!!!!) 50 years, but it's been
rode hard and put away wet. lots of scars and pains, several of which were
due to a 22-month vacation with my favorite uncle in a small southeast asian
country, and most of the rest simply due to youth, enthusiasm, and pure-dee
stupidity. :) my training has usually been with crayons, as they won't let
me have anything sharp around here ... i spent 4-1/2 miserable years in
aerospace engineering before i figured out that i was not an engineer and
wasn't likely to become one by default. i finagled a college degree (after
my favorite uncle gave me some monthly monies ... i think he felt guilty)
... and it is my belief that i hold the ONLY Bachelor of Arts in Computer
Science and Mathematics ever issued by this football team. anyway, it was
a screw-up because of the length of time spent loitering in the hallowed
halls of humility, and the fact that the records office looked only at the
last four pages of my transcript ... the ones with all the philosophy and
english classes on them. oh, well, it's just a union card anyway. :)

as Steve told you, there used to be an initial vanagon list, run by another
fellow (not Gerry), but he (the other fellow) fell afoul of &quot;work&quot; and the
list mailer kinda got run over by some necessary projects. so Gerry, being
the sweet-hearted easily-conned soul that he is, fell prey to my suggestions
that he (not me) start another list. :)  and here we are folks.

my personal opinion is that it's a really neat place to visit and talk to
folks. granted, all of YOU out there are a bit weird, but that's ok ...
i can make allowances for folks who never had Possum Stew or Barbecued Kudzu
or Muscadine Wine or Filet d'Alligator Flambeau ... after all, not everyone
is as lucky as i am. :)

that's about it. as my old Latin teacher used to say, &quot;Get out of here! You're
not taking this class!!!&quot;
