Subject: Brake line replacement.

Yes yes, I know that Bob Hoover recently wrote a very informative spiel 
on this very subject but I was wondering if I SHOULD replace my brake 
lines.  You see I bought this '66 Westy with no brakes ('cept hand 
brake).  I look in the master cylinder and jar, and both are bone dry.  I 
removed the master cylinder and had no fluid come from any of the 
three(?) lines at all (which reminds me-why are there three brake lines 
coming out of the cyl.?).  This bus hasn't been registered since 1983 so 
I'm none too surprised.  Here's the question, should I try to flush out 
and use the existing lines or should I just replace the whole system?  
What would YOU do?
TIA
-Erik
