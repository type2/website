&gt;Your story reminds me of when I started up my first rebuild. I used a
&gt;muffler that had sat in our shed for 2 years.  After the engine caught
&gt;I went back to tune it and discovered nesting material blown outall over
&gt;the garage. no baby mice, though they were found in later parts box 
rumaging.

Before every flight, a pilot does a preflight inspection of his light
plane. One place he ALWAYS checks, is to look carefully into the front
nostrils on either side of the propellor, checking for... you guessed
it... birds nests or rats nests. Those can ruin your whole day, as well
as the bird's or rat's day.

So, be heartened-- you're in good company.
