Pilgrims,

	Well, the overhwelming consensus is to have this some time
after 11:00AM.  Sounds good to me.  How 'bout we make it Noon O' clock? 

	This might preclude mountain biking activities, but then again 
it looks like this party is gonna take shape as it happens...

	Remember:

	When: Sat Aug 19th, 12:00noon
	Where: Pescadoes, Fair Oaks Blvd, Sacramento (see web page for map)
	Who:  The cool people
	Why:  Just because
	
Thom
