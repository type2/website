     Hello Randy,
     
     You need to use DOT 4 brake fluid, and the reservoir is located above 
     the instrument cluster behind your steering wheel.  The cover just 
     pops off, and you will see the tank.  A small funnel helps a lot, 
     cause it's easy to spill fluid.
     
     Good luck.

Sorry to ask dumb questions, but I just got my 86 GL ( my first VW, but for 
sure not my last) and haven't got a Bentley manual yet, my clutch seems to 
be quite soft and engages very low, there was a new clutch put in about 10k 
ago. Am I dealing with a hydraulic clutch system that needs fluid? If so, 
where is the fill located and what type of fluid does it use? I looked last 
night to no avail. Couldn't find the Brake master cylinder either. any 
input any of you fellow v-dub heads have would be greatly appreciated.
