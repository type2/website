Subject: Re: more Q's on the TDI

&gt;        The VW owners' manual with my diesel allows the addition of
&gt;up to 30% leaded or unleaded regular gasoline to the diesel fuel in
&gt;the tank.

Good to know, thanks,

&gt;It will not destroy the motor, nor will it &quot;detonate, pre-ignite etc.&quot; Since
&gt;the fuel is injected at the correct instant, it will operate well so long
&gt;as you haven't exceeded the 30% ratio of gasoline to diesel fuel.

OK, but this is not 100% gasoline, the gasoline in diesel is also
used for operation at low temperatures to prevent flaking of the diesel?

I heard about diesels running on their engine oil when they get real hot...
so the only way to stop it is to block the airinlet... we have a phrase
for this but i can't translate it very well, we call it the same as a horse
that's out of control and takes off...

Brian.
