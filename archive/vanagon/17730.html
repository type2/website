&gt; Well, David Schwarze started it and I'm following into his footsteps. We
&gt; both have a set of 4 solar panels, each 1 by 4 ft. in size.  The set is
&gt; rated at 87 Watt. David has his already installed, while I'm struggling to
&gt; find time on a rainless day. 

I just want to point out that though the panels are rated at 87 watts,
I am getting 120 watts out of mine.  Of course, I only had room for half
of them on the roof of my bus. :(

&gt; Another problem is that those 4 panels weight about 20 pounds and they
&gt; will make the pop-top so much more difficult to lift. Maybe some gas
&gt; struts would help. I'm also very nervous about drilling holes into the
&gt; pop-top. Maybe a couple of beers would help. :-)

Worked for me...  but every once in a while when I'm sober I start to
worry about the strain those panels put on the roof.  Oh well, I can
always get another bubble top if this one flies off.
