Subject: Re: A/C compressor not turning

In a message dated 96-05-13 16:31:47 EDT, you write:

&gt;Outside temperature was 70F so the temp sensors should have allowed the 
&gt;compressor to engage.

Check out these possibilities:

1. There are also high &amp; low pressure switches.  If the freon has leaked out
the pressure will be below the minimum required to engage the system.

2. There is an A/C fuse in the regular fuse area.

3. There is another LARGE fuse on the left pillar by the rear hatch.  It is
hidden by a plactic cover in a regular Vanagon, or behind a closet in a
Camper.

I don't call what the specific function of either of these fuses is, but I
think that either one can cause your symptoms.

Good luck,
