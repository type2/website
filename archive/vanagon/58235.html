Subject: Type two shifter and bottom of shifter

I have given up trying to fix my type two shifter problem so I am
appealing to the group.  M&lt;y friend who is a mechanic states the shifter
won't work because of some kind of a notching system that is worn out and
will not allow the shifter to select a gear.  If I double clutch, I can
find a progressive gear but sometimes I have to come to ,a stop , put the
van in gear and start the engine again.  I have a new clutch, pressure
plate, throeout bearing, and all the related seal in the van now.  Can an
after market shift lever like a Hurst or other type solve this problem?
Has anyone else on the list ever had a similar problem with this type of
vehicle,( 1978 F.I. 2 litre Westy) ??? Help!!  I also had a new rubber
bushing installed at the front of the transmission where the shifter rod
enters.
