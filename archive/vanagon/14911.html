&gt; Pete,
&gt; 	Here is a list of names and e-mails of people I have that are on
&gt; the East coast and have expressed some interest in GNATT:
&gt; 
&gt; Are you still willing to try and coordinate something?  It looks like
&gt; the West coast leg will be starting from St. Louis on Monday, May 29th
&gt; (after Busses by the Arch).  Let me know if you still want to do this,
&gt; and if not I will send this list to someone else...

Hi,

I've gotten busy and am way behind on email....  started working my way 
backwards.  Whatcha talkin about?  We're based in Northern Virgina and 
are interested in any east coast vw van type activity.  (93 Eurovan MV - 
almost a weekender)
