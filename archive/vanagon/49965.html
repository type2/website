&gt; At 140 K my van began to have some shifting problem.  Around town, fine, but
&gt; take it on extended trip at high speeds I have had problems getting it into
&gt; first, second, third.  Reverse, it tends to grind a little.  Bled the system
&gt; as people suggested (are you suppose to pump the clutch are just open the
&gt; bled valve and let it run out?).  Noticed no grinding for about ten miles
&gt; but then, back to the same old thing.  Cluth does not slip.  Could someone
&gt; post there experience in &quot;how to&quot; replace/rebuild the clutch master cylnder
&gt; and the slave cylinder?

             Sounds to me like this is not your problem. Try
             the pilot bearing!
