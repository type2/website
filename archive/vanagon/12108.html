Subject: Old Bus Backfire

I'm the newsletter editor for the local bus club here in Atlanta.

Even though the things in here are very regional I thought maybe some
of you might be interested.

Probably of most interest is our Vintage Volkswagen Show which will
be held June 25th.  Last year we had over 30 split window buses,
over 30 bubble window buses, a couple of split window bugs, and a 
handfull of oval windows.

I want to invite any of you who can make it to join us this year.

Anyhow, the following is the latest newsletter:


Greetings!

Greetings bus enthusiasts! I hope everyone is hitting on all four 
cylinders and keeping your oil changed. Sorry for the length of time 
since the last OLD BUS BACKFIRE but the holidays and new year kept us 
all very busy, as I'm sure it did you. Now I'm sure you're dreaming of 
getting your bus ready for a fun-filled year of bus- related action. 
Remember... this is your club!  If we're not doing something you think 
we should do, let us know. Communication is the best way to start the 
ball rolling.

Upcoming Events

Mar. 12	PST's Club Meeting

We will be having a meeting of PST on Sunday, March 12th, at the 60's 
style McDonald's again at I-575 and Hwy. 92 in Woodstock, Ga. (not N.Y.).
The time will  be 3:00 p.m. with a caravan leaving from Southern Tech 
in Marietta at 2:00 p.m.. We encourage everyone to attend as will be 
discussing important points and encourage everyone to attend. If you 
can't drive your bus that's okay, come out in whatever gets you there.

Jun. 2-4	Buses on the Blue Ridge

We have been asked to coordinate a caravan from the Atlanta area to 
&quot;Buses on the Blue Ridge&quot;. This could turn out to be a great bus 
gathering if what we're hearing from other NEATO chapters is true. Let 
us know what you think about where we  should  meet, when we should 
leave, etc.. This event is happening on June 2nd thru 4th.

Jun. 25	Vintage Show &amp; Shine

The biggest and best air-cooled VW show in the southeast will again be 
held at Southern Tech this June 25th. This show is sponsored by Peach 
State Transporters and will most undoubtedly be even bigger and better 
than the last two years. With this in mind, we will need much more help 
from club members to be able to host a really great show. PST is the 
sole sponsor for this event, so please volunteer!  We will start getting 
together to work everything out soon. Also if you have suggestions on 
how to make the show even better let us know ASAP.
 
PST's October Meeting Report

On Sunday afternoon, October 30th, a group of members met at Southern 
Tech to caravan up to the McDonald's in Woodstock.  Those in attendance 
were Tim Humphries - 63 Crew Cab, Steve Wiltin - 66 Hardtop Deluxe, 
Dewayne Epperson - 67 Crew Cab, George &amp; Bobbie Ratteree - 75 Westfalia, 
Dave Easterwood - 77 Westfalia, Mell Wallace - 85 Cavalier, Chris 
Johnson - 87 Diamondback Bicycle, and Mike Todd - Audi.  Allen Becker 
was out of state and couldn't attend so Dave Easterwood presided over 
the proceedings.  Among the items discussed were the club meeting 
schedule.  We decided to try to have a meeting every other month.  
Another thing that was suggested was having an additional swap meet 
sometime in the year.  And finally, we all agreed that everyone in the 
club should chip in a few dollars to Allen to help defray the cost of 
putting out the newsletter and mailing it to everyone.

After the meeting we all went outside to look at all the buses.  As we 
were doing this Chris &amp; Trish Martel passed by in a 72 bus and noticed 
us and stopped to talk.  Turns out they also have a 59 Single Cab 
(unfortunately, since the meeting it has been wrecked).

Bulli Brigade &amp; Bug Jam Report

On November 11, a group of members met to caravan down to Tampa for two 
VW shows.  In the caravan were Allen Becker - 87 Plymouth Voyager, Tim 
Humpries - 63 Crew Cab, Nick Azzolesi - 65 Kombi, Dave Easterwood - 77 
Westfalia, and Pete Durand hitching rides with Nick &amp; Dave.

It was a LONG ride down, but when we got to the campsite around midnight 
we were happy to find some friends from Tennessee and New York already 
there.

The next day at the Bulli Brigade we saw other PST members Mike Todd and 
Doug Davis.  This was a great first show and our hats go off to Mike 
Brown for getting thirty or so splits together (of course a couple of 
them were from our club!).  We can't let these guys beat us, so make 
sure you can get your buses ready by June 25th!

The next day we took in the Bug Jam.  This is a really big show with a 
huge swap meet.  There, we ran into PST member Bob Hagen and a friend, 
John Aracri - 62 23 window. Some of us had met him surfing at Cape 
Hatteras last summer.

The drive back was an adventure, because we weren't sure Tim was going 
to make it.  He was blowing oil like Ol' Faithful, but eventually made 
it home!
