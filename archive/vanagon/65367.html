There was a great article in the Porsche club magazine, Perfection? about
the trying to get a '70 or '71 911s to pass the new smogII tests. The car
had a just rebuilt engine to factory specs. Anyway, the way the owner got
it to pass was to place larger diameter tires on the rear of the car to
change what gear the car would be in on the dynamomiter test. Seems the CA
laws are specific on no engine mods - but say nothing about tire size..
The tester gave him a funny look - but he ended up passing. They had a
photo of the 911 with the oversized tires on the back, looked pretty
amusing.
