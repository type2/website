Subject: Vanagon Question?

 I own an '85 Vanagon with almost 140,000 miles and have been looking to
 replace it with one with fewer miles.  Today I found an '86 Syncro with
 83,000 that is in very good condition.  I don't know much about the all
 wheel drive Vanagon's and am concerned whether the had any unique problems
 or things to look out for.  This particular van has the weekender package
 and the guy is asking $4600.
 Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
