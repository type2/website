Subject: Re: Exhaust Pipes 2.1 86and up!

Hello,
        I'm trying to avoid having to replace my exhaust pipes, and since
they are solid, I think this must be possible.  The problem is that the
flanges on either end of my collector pipe are so rusted that the bolts are
gonna be gone soon.  The flanges themselves are solid, but the bolts and
flanges are like one piece of metal!

As a recently relocated Californian, I dont' know what to do about this!!
I've never had to deal with such rust...does anyone have any advice?

How can I get the old pipes off, with the bolts, in order to simple
reinstall the same pipes?  Must I replace solid pipes just because I can't
get a rusted bot removed from it?


Any advice would be appreciated,
Greg
89 Westy
