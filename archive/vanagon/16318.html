&gt; &gt;Has anyone had or know of the 
&gt; &gt;costs and pains of converting a bus (esp 71 and before) to a westy 
&gt; &gt;camper, either one that's already a camper to a pop-top, or a transporter 
&gt; &gt;to a camper?  Can some of the work be done at home or must all of it be 
&gt; &gt;done at a shop?

I've got a 1973 Westfalia in very clean condition. I just bought it from 
the original owner, and it has 146 miles on it. The canvas is good, and 
it came with a tent and a small hammock that hangs over the front seat. 
The problem is, I need to carry six peole in this thing. We MAY camp in 
it. So, can I stip off the westfailia stuff and sell it. Or is there a 
way to add a jumpseat and seabelt somethwere??
