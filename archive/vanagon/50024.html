A few weeks ago someone posted re: Weddle Eng'g installing a LockRite rear 
diff in a 2WD vanagon.  This might provide some firsthand impression.  The VW 
vacuum locker is definately better, IMHO.   tim smith

I have a lockright in my wrangler and it works great offroad.  On road
it's a little tricky to get used to.  The tires chirp and sometimes a low
speeds it jerks the jeep back and forth.  In the snow you just have to be
real careful and not drive stupid.  Don't floor it while in a corner
especially since you have a pick-up.  I chose the lockright becasue of the
durability and price, but if I had the money I would opt for the air
locker.  If you don't have a lot of money you might also look at the E-Z
locker by Detroit which is similiar to the Lcokright.
