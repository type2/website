&gt;&gt; in 1964 the Deluxe no logner has corner windows.  And my '64 which is a
&gt;&gt; Deluxe (the kelly blue book says 'Deluxe Wagon' if I go by VIN number) does
&gt;&gt; not have corner window (or sunroof or portholes - sigh).
&gt;
&gt;What *does* it have? Seats? Glass in the Windows? DoeSPOONsn't sound  
&gt;very deluxe so far ; )

Well, it has two colors, chrome VW in front, chrome (used to be?) trim all
around with the V-molding in the trim, Wheel trim (only on one or two wheels
now, three pop-out windows on each side plus a forth that doesn't pop-out
and those and the rear window have cargo bars.  A bench seat up front (used
to have rear seats by the mounts in the floor but gone also :-(.  And a
stock Five-speed (ok, just kidding).  I've never thought it as that Deluxe
-- isn't deluxe with french fries?
