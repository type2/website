Subject: Re: FWD (1600 engine parts needed in Portugal)


You might try this site. It says there that these folks are importers to
the US for VW Brazil, and exporters from Brazil. I'd think it was strange
if an exporter in Brazil wouldn't send stuff to Portugal. I know nothing
about this vendor other than the URL of the site:

http://www.marnal_dot_com


&gt;Hey can anybody help this guy out, looking for parts places in
&gt;Portugal, reply to him not me.

&gt;&gt;Hello, I'm the owner of VW Combi 75, with a 1600cc air cooled engine. I'm
&gt;&gt;having troubles with my engine and some spare parts here in Portugal.
&gt;&gt;Please, send me some information about places near by, where I can find
&gt;&gt;these parts. Thank You.
