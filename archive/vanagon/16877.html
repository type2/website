Subject: Really really vague rebuild problems.


Ok, so no respopnses about the Bosch 050...

So last summer I had to rebuild my '76.  (2.0, Feul inject...)
I had never done anything like that.  Fortunately, at the important steps 
like assembling the crankcase, I had a local (Aspen, Col.) VW guru help 
me out.  He was so helpful.  If you are ever in town, look up Jim Hayes.

After I got everything going, it ran fine.  But it ran HOT (like 350-375 
head temp) and the compressionwas not so good, like 90's all around.  
Now, I know that these are the most vague symptoms possible.  Anything 
could be wrong.

The only mistake that I am aware of is that I mismatched the new 
cylinders with their pistons.

Despite these symptoms (heat and compression) being about the most vague 
problems possible, I'd like to know what I can do or check.  I have done 
the standard tune-up about 5 times.  Also, it was driven 1000 miles, so I 
think everything is &quot;broken in.&quot;  I was thinking of taking it to a local 
VW mechanic back in Indiana and just saying - Whenever you have time in 
the next 4 weeks, look this over.

Any suggestions?
