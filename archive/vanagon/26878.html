Subject: I'm now down to 3.5 buses!

Yep, the '80 camper is now only about 50% there... about waist high.
I dropped off the doors I didn't want and the roof at the dump
yesterday, one load in the '66.

Anybody in the Bay Area that wants to come by and pick at the remains can
do so.  Just Email me for directions.

I've removed almost everything from the interior that I think I should
keep.  Everyhting I don't want, is getting trashed.  So if you think you
want something, anything let me know.  I thought I would post a list of
the parts that I can think of right now.  If it's not on the list I either
forgot, or I'm planning on throwing it away, or haven't removed it yet.  I
haven't gotten to the stuff under the Vanagon yet, but most of it's spoken
for already. 

I thought someone asked about the antenna, but I can't find any Email.  
Maybe I imagined it in a drunken stupor.  :)
I think someone also wanted the Hazard switch... who?

For sure FREE stuff!  :)  Anything that is ASI only goes to any ASI owner 
that wants it for free.  Anyone actually.  Here's what I can think of:

ASI camper stuff:
4 hold down thingies for the pop top
Curtain set, brownish, complete (I think).  One has cigarette burns 
Faucets (Coleman rocker pump and a city water tap)
Water tank (9.5 Gal?)
Fluorescent light, no cover
Water pump, electric.  100GPH, 1.25A, non-priming

I plan on selling most of the stuff that I keep, but ask, I might give it 
away if I'm in a good mood.  :)  I haven't set any prices yet, I'll do 
that after I finish stripping the bus.  

Parts available from '80 Vanagon so far:
Instrument panel (Speedo and gas gauge)
Bumper end caps (LR &amp; RF only)
Front seats, brown 
Door lock set, matched.  Key WTO (or WT0?)
Lock mechanism from sliding door
Steering column switches (turn, wiper and ignition)
Steering Wheel
Switches from instrument panel (Hazard, headlight, rear defog)
Side windows
Rear Window
Screens for sliding side windows (from ASI?)
Windwing from drivers side
Window from drivers side
Window regulator from drivers side
Rear view mirror
Side mirrors
Passenger door
Wiper motor and wiper linkage
Wiper arms
Heater blower motor
Seatbelts (2 front w/retractor, 2 rear)
Jack 
Antenna
