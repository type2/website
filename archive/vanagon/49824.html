Subject: Exhaust systems and pipes

This was on the Toronto Star's website today--this place fabricates exhaust
pipes and seeing as I understand some replacement pipes for type IV engines
are unavailable, you might check this place out.

&gt;
&gt;Finding the right pipes and muffler for your vintage car or truck can be
&gt;tough. It is important
&gt;to get the right length, diameter and muffler to get the optimum performance
&gt;from your
&gt;vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;Well, finding that vintage exhaust has become a little easier, with the help
&gt;of Ontario Vintage
&gt;Exhaust. Formerly known as Shady Jakes, located just an hour northeast of
&gt;Toronto in
&gt;Brooklin.
&gt;
&gt;What makes all this quite different is that Shady Jakes, or should I say
&gt;Ontario Vintage Exhaust,
&gt;stocks literally thousands of original pipes and mufflers. 
&gt;
&gt;Owner Chris Wells told me that he has just about every domestic exhaust
&gt;system in stock from
&gt;about 1928 to 1975 in stock. As for the foreign systems, Wells says they
&gt;have a pretty good
&gt;selection dating back to the 1950s (most imports came after the WWII).
&gt;
&gt;Ontario Vintage Exhaust caters to those looking for the real thing in their
&gt;restorations. Wells
&gt;pointed out the original stampings on the mufflers authenticating their
&gt;origin as factory
&gt;original pieces.
&gt;
&gt;I had the good fortune to spend an afternoon with Wells checking out the
&gt;stock of pipes and
&gt;mufflers he had in his showroom. I was amazed to find good quality in the
&gt;factory exhaust
&gt;systems over the years. Wells pointed out that it was not uncommon in ``the
&gt;god old days'' for
&gt;exhaust systems to last a good 10 to 15 years.
&gt;
&gt;If Vintage doesn't have the exhaust system you are looking for, and there
&gt;are a few that don't
&gt;exist, they can usually be made for you. Vintage usually has templates that
&gt;allow them to
&gt;construct a proper system for your old vehicle. It's at this point, an
&gt;appropriate muffler can be
&gt;chosen (many mufflers will interchange).
&gt;
&gt;When making these systems, Vintage uses a 14-gauge aluminized pipe.
&gt;According to Wells,
&gt;the aluminized pipe works generally better than any other pipe, including
&gt;stainless steel. Yes, I
&gt;know some of you will debate the fact and claim stainless steel is better,
&gt;but if not welded
&gt;correctly it just won't hold up as well.
&gt;
&gt;For added corrosion protection, Vintage will add a protective coating to the
&gt;outside of the
&gt;complete exhaust system at no charge. This coating is, believe it or not,
&gt;just barbecue grill
&gt;paint, which Wells claims works best on all systems.
&gt;
&gt;Now, if you have an unusual car, and have the original exhaust, Vintage will
&gt;bend an exact
&gt;duplicate. With some engine specifications, the right muffler will also be
&gt;picked for the vehicle.
&gt;It goes without saying that Vintage also supplies resonators, as needed for
&gt;your vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;Prices for exhaust pipes start at $65, on up to complete dual exhaust
&gt;systems for V-8 engined
&gt;vehicles at $350. For example, complete systems for six-cylinder cars and
&gt;trucks is about $200.
&gt;
&gt;Ontario Vintage Exhaust ships pipes anywhere. They can reached at
&gt;1-905-655-7473.
&gt;
&gt;While we are on the topic of parts for older vehicles, I would like to
&gt;mention another great
&gt;spot, Obsolete Automotive, of Point Edward (near Sarnia). 
&gt;
&gt;These people specialize in British sports car parts. They send out a monthly
&gt;tabloid-sized
&gt;newspaper called Sports Car Chronicle. This paper is crammed with sale parts
&gt;and great
&gt;information on repairing your British car.
&gt;
&gt;For the month of September they cover engine components for the MGB, as well as
&gt;rebuilding of the engine, the parts you will need and the basics on how to
&gt;do it all. The
&gt;editorial is straightforward and honest, giving you the right information to
&gt;solve most of your
&gt;problems.
&gt;
&gt;Obsolete Auto tends to specialize in MG's, Triumph and Austin-Healeys with a
&gt;hodge-podge
&gt;of other British sports cars parts. To get a copy of the Chronicle, give
&gt;them a call at
&gt;1-800-265-7437 or 1-519-337-3232 for customer service. They also have a web
&gt;site at
&gt;www.sarnia_dot_com/obsolete.
