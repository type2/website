&gt; &gt;Thanks for the reality check! Sometimes (confession time!) I wonder what 
&gt; &gt;it would be like to own a new crysler minivan. Thanks for setting me 
&gt; &gt;straight.
&gt; 
&gt; Then again, there are always exceptions...my father wonders why I keep buying
&gt; VW's, when his Chrysler vans perform so well...he puts about 40k/year on 'em,
&gt; and has never had any problems...go figure...'Course, he buys a new one every
&gt; three years, so prolly never kept one long enough to have rust..(sigh)..ha
&gt; also sent me an e-mail the other night, wondering why the Eurovan hadn't made
&gt; the C&amp;D Car of the Year  (salt in the wound).  Guess I'll just have to keep
&gt; comparing bank statements!  ;)

Lets not get too deep into EV vs. Caravan... but the best of the T4 
series can't come intot he US because of protectionsit import laws.  Its 
a truck and can't be imported easily.  If it could the EV wouldn't have 
been on haitus  and might be 'eligible' for car of the year.  Got have 
them available don't they?

My brother turned traitor and got a used Dodge mini-'van'.  to go along 
with his Jetta and his wife's Accord.  What an assemblage of cars that is.

No comaprison between his Caravan and our MV.  Its like comparing a 
Squareback Type III and a Deluxe Type II.  Both hold more than a standard 
sedan but one obviously holds more than the other.  (Don't be mad I'd 
MUCH rather have a Type III than a Caravan.  Comparison on storage room 
ONLY.)
