Subject: ISBN, tools, ect.

 Thanks to Mr. Goldberg for the information on the awning and Pat Walsh for
the info on Hemmings. As I stated in a previous message, I'll be acquiring a
1956 Kombi for full restoration. One problem I have, since I have never done
such a big project, is the lack of expertise in the tools department. If
anyone has a list of tools that I will be needing for the project, would you
be so kind and e-mail it to me? TIA. If these tools are mentioned in the
manuals below, please, just disregard this question.

 The second problem is more simple: I need the ISBN, title and author for
the Bentley, the Muir and any other shop/mechanic manuals for vehicles,
mostly, busses and Type 3's (Squarebacks) of all years. Thank you again!
