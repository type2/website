O.K., some quick calculation, just for fun:
at 4000 rpm, the Vanagon is going at about 70Mph. 

assume
35 hp is lost to air friction, transmission, etc.. So, we're left
with:

230-35 = 195 hp...

(I hope I get all unit conversion close)
 195 hp == 195 * .77  kWatts == (about) 150kW



70Mph = (1610 * 70 ) / 3600 = 31.31 meters/sec
assume 10% grade, which means altitude increases at 3.1 meters / sec.
(if my definition of % grade is correct -- never got it quite right)

150 kW means we can 150kJoules every second, sooo, we can be driving a
*total load of*  : (what was the g factor? 9.8 m/sec**2 ?? )

   150,000 / 3.1 / 9.8 = 4937.4 kilograms, or (almost) ** 5 Metric TONS !!**

wow!!!

Soo, you could actually put one of these engines in your Vanagon, and
you would potentially be able to tow 2 more vanagons behind you at
70 MPH up a 10% grade!!! (I can't help wonder what kind of
acceleration you'd get out of it, unfortunately, we do not know the
torque curve -- a torque of 224 ft-pounds would give very decent
acceleration, but at what rpm? 4000?)

Maybe this kind of engine is the one to put the EVanatics to shame and
rival the Porsche 6 conversion :-)

 &gt; Just had to throw this in:  Minutes ago I walked past a Subaru 
 &gt; dealership.  They had a big display in the window about some new 
 &gt; model, I forget which.  It has a 3.3 liter six that puts out 230hp at 
 &gt; 4,000 rpm, torque was something like 224.  Just injected, no turbos.  
 &gt; It had a six coil ignition system, at least that is what I got from 
 &gt; the poster.  I should have walked in and started asking annoying 
 &gt; questions.  I wonder how big that engine is?  hmmmmm
