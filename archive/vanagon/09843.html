Subject: Re: The water heater project

&gt;     Firstly was the design of a water filled heater box. I am going to
&gt;     buy one bare J-tube (cost about 7 quid) this weekend. Basically it's
&gt;     a heater box exhaust tube - without the heater box shroud and fins.
&gt;     I am going to weld a water tight tube around this J-tube as below:
&gt;
&gt;     J tube \ ___
&gt;             /               water tight tube
&gt;       out__|_____________ /
&gt;             \_|__________|___
&gt;               |__________|_
&gt;                             in
&gt;

This sounds like a pretty good idea to me! My concerns would be: 1) the system
must have an expansion tank since it's a closed loop, and 2) there must be
some sort of relief valve (like on any heating vessel) in case your water pump
fails or your expansion tank isn't big enough. I think that you did mention
some sort of tank to let off steam. If that includes a relief valve, you'll be
in good shape.
