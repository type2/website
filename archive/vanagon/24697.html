&gt;Definitely the &quot;Milepost&quot;.  A new one comes out each spring, and either &gt;you
&gt;can find it when you get into the area, or you could have a local &gt;bookstore
&gt;order it in for you (about $20, ISBN 1-878425-25-0).

My wife and I have started to talk about joining the Inuvik expedition and
I've been looking at this book. I've seen it at some bookstores (Barnes and
Noble, Brentanos) and it is great. I'm going to wait to buy it until next
years edition comes out, but I checked it out of the library. It covers all
the highways in BC, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Alaska on a mile by mile
basis (hence the name). Information on Road conditions updated each year, all
the campgrounds and services available along the way. If your planning on
going to the top of the world, you should get this book.
