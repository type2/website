Subject: Rough Running

Ok, I replaced the carbs on my '74, and tuned it as well.  There was a
wire on the plate that the points mount on to that connects to the body of
the distributor.  I had to replace that, and I re-set the timing.  The car
idles well, but is sort of jerky on acceleration.  It acts like it is
either lean or maybe the timing is off.

I noticed that the timing is supposed to be set at 5 degrees *after* TDC,
which seems a little odd.  Aren't most cars set at something before TDC?
I set mine to the specs(5 ATDC) and now this problem is occuring.  Any
ideas?  The carbs were rebuilt right before they went on the car.  My
vacuum advance works, and the dwell/point gap is correct.
