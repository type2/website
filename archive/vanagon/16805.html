Subject: Re: Kinda Stumped

&gt;Here's my major concern, I turn the key and she won't respond,
&gt;this has been ongoing for a while (I'm still poor), at first
&gt;I assumed the starter or solenoid, I would bang on the starter
&gt;and she would start, I changed the starter, and she works great, 
&gt;for 3-4 months, then she does the same thing, so I start thinking 
&gt;it must be the ingnition, from the key back. My friend that owns 
&gt;a VW repair shop says that changing this is a pain, so he gives me 
&gt;another starter (used but looks good and works) I put it in and it 
&gt;works great for another semester, I also stuck a button (in a secret 
&gt;spot behind my seat ;)) that puts juice directly to the solenoid, but
&gt;this button is not fused and sometimes hangs up (won't stop cranking,
&gt;even with no key) now the same thing is starting again. 

I recently found that the spade connector that attaches to the selenoid was
broken, but didn't look it.  Those spade connectors, they aren't always as
tight as they look to be.  Close them them up a bit with pliers, or replace
them.  The reverse light contacts also seem to go often.
