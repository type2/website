&gt; Before you break down and throw money at a dealer, you might try a used unit
&gt; from a wrecking yard.  I believe that this is a BOSCH made unit, simiilar (but
&gt; probably different) from the ones used in BMWs, and what I hear from that
&gt; on-line net group is that these boxes are fairly ava#005#ilable and cheap at
&gt; wreckers  =&gt; that they are pretty reliable.  Most reputable yards will
&gt; guarantee a &quot;good&quot; module.

Ive been through this before for parts for my trany.  There isnt a 
good supply of used vanagons around in Ontario to wish for a used 
part.  The van runs real rough right now (20l/100 km), so I could 
hang on for a while.  If there is someone out there who could locate 
a used one, that would be one strike against those crooks (the 
dealers)!  The part no. is 251 907 393B. The dealer wants $505. And 
20% restocking if I just want to look for IC#s. There is no guarantee 
that the chips will have recognizable #. 

Thanks in advance if anyone can help.
