David Carment:  I noticed your post regarding painting your vanagon
and replacing peeling/cracked &quot;wallpaper&quot; in the interior of the
vanagon.  I'd like to recommend if you have trouble getting this stuff
off, that you use a hair dryer.  The heat softens the adhesive, and
makes the job much easier.  I tried replacing mine with something
we have here in the states called &quot;Contact&quot; paper, which is basically
a self-adhesive-backed plastic-type shelf-paper, and while this looked
excellent at first (since I was able to match the color almost perfectly
to the original), within less than 6 months it buckled in parts which
received moisture or heat.  If you find something suitable, let me know..
