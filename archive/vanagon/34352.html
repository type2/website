&gt; yesterday i recieved the new j.c.whitney catalog.  thats fine and all
&gt; 'cause i've been meening to subscribe but how did they know i even
&gt; owned a v.w.?  as i see it, only some one who knows my address and
&gt; knows i own a v.w. could have let them know.  my friends and family
&gt; meet these criteria but none of em would have a reason to talk to
&gt; whitney.  then there's the mechanic that fixed my ball joints but i
&gt; can't see why he would give them the information.  the only
&gt; reasonable idea i came up with is that maybe the secretary of state
&gt; sells them a list of the names and addresses of people that buy v.w's
&gt; each year since i just bought it in august and recieved the first
&gt; catalog yesterday.  if so, it's a little disturbing how easily
&gt; personal information becomes public.  and probably at a nice profit
&gt; to the person gathering the info.  hmmmm, i suppose it could have
&gt; also been the insurance company.
&gt;     any ideas as to where whitney gets their mailing lists?  i'd
&gt; really like to know cause anyone that actively researches what kind
&gt; of vehicle i drive and where i live,  and then sells the information
&gt; deserves a serious reaming.
That is curious indeed, because I received *my* unsolicited Volkswagen catalog
from them yesterday as well...
Hmmmmmmmmm.
