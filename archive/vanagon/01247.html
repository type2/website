Subject: 86 Vanagon start problem


The 86 vanagon I bought from a local car dealer came with an Interstate 
battery that is only about 6 months old. Starting the van when its cold, 
or been sitting for a while is no problem; however after the intial 
start, when I shut the van down, and then try to restart it, it acts as 
if the battery isn't fully charged. The starter drags, and almost goes 
completely flat, then ZOOM, it cranks and the engine starts. 

I took the van to a car battery shop that checks your electrical system 
for free. The guy checked it out, told me the battery was completely 
charged, but that the battery was much too small to be in this vehicle. 
This battery was rated at 400 cca, and I needed one in the 650 range. I 
looked around town, tracked down the nearest Interstate battery dealer 
and asked if I could get a prorate to upgrade to the correct size for the 
vanagon. After much finagling, I ended up getting a brand new Interstate 
battery with 650 cca for less than $20.00!!! 

More than happy with the spoils of my dealings, I installed the new 
battery and ZOOM- the van started wonderfully, and off I went back to work.
About an hour later when I tried to start it again, I got the same 
response as with the smaller battery. The starter drags until it almost 
seems as if the battery is dead, then it cranks and takes off.

Anyone venture an explanation? The starter is old and draws too many amps?
The compression is so wonderful that when the engine is warm its 
difficult to crank over? The timing needs to be reset? Sun spots?

The van runs incredibly well once its started. 21+ mpg. New heads put on 
less than 2000 miles ago. Compression was tested before we bought it, and 
it checked out fine.

The van has never failed to start for us, but seems as though it may at 
any time...
