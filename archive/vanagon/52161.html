I have a few old rabbit heads around here, If they'll fit you could =
probably have one.  However since you mention damage, you'll probably =
have to redo the head and the bottom end.  The reason being that since =
clearances are so close in a diesel, you may have bent the rod or =
severly damaged the piston.  I suggest you contact MOFCO (in Wisconson) =
they have rebuilt heads for about $250 for rabbits.

Regards.
