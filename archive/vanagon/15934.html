Subject: 86 Westy to buy

Hello All,

I am currently in the WannaVan category and have been ease dropping
on the VANAGON list for a about a month. A local VW dealer has an
'86 Westy for sale with 127K miles, Wolfsburg Edition, 4sp and AC.
It's the basic camper, no sink or stove.  It's in fair condition,
drove well, the dealer is asking $3995, which sounds reasonable to
me. The most outstanding problems are:

1. The oil light came on after the engine was hot and at idle.
   What does that indicate?

2. The rear chrome bumper has surface rust.
   How much does a replacement bumper cost?

3. The body looks solid, but has a dent on the driver side and
   has some surface rust.

4. The driver seat is tatered.
   Are seat covers or replacement seats available?

5. Part of the pop top seal has separated from the fiberglass.
   How much does a new seal cost?

6. The ride was a little soft.
   How much for shocks or struts? I don't know what type is used on 
   Vanagons.

I kind of know what I am getting into here since in the past I had
owned the following VWs. '63 Beetle, 2 - '65 Beetles, - '72  Super,
and a '78 Rabbit.

Thank you in advance for any responses.

John Sharpe
