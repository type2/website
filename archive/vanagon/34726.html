Hiya Matt,

Thanks for you inquire, I'm glad that you found our homepage!  I hope it
was useful, any suggestions?  We currently have these Eurovans in stock:
                93' MV green AT 43K for   $20,495
                93' GL white 5spd 45K for $17,995
                93' CL white AT 38K for   $14,995
                Four 93' MV Weekenders (camper) 2 sticks 2 auto. for $23,995
I have been a little slow in updating the internet, sorry.

Regarding the rumor of a VR6 Eurovan.  Volkswagen has discontinued
production plans for the U.S. indefinitely of any vans.

As far as price, I'll save you 8-10% off any of the above vans.
