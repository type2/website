I would like help in clarifying the country of manufacture for 
several tool brands featured in the Harbor Freight tool catalog.  I 
wish to avoid tools made in China when buying sight unseen via the 
mail. Why do you want to avoid tools  made in China.  One of the 
problems is that environmental rgulations in this country and poor 
managemnt has closed most of our foundries.  Most tools are forged.  
China has lots of foundries and forges.  FOr what they build, they 
are fantastic bargains.  I think all rotors and drums are from 
china.  We can hardly write off a country of 1 billion people 
without more of an explanation. We buy oil from Kuwait, coffe from 
central america, diamonds form south africa.  Money talks.so....
     
If you can verify the country of manufacture for the following i will 
summarize them and repost.  Additionally, add to the list if you 
like, giving comments on the product quality.
     
     I think all these tols are made by the same company.  
Cen-Tech
Central Pnuematic
These tools are okay, but nor real strong, or precise
Central Machine
Central Electric
Pittsburg
these are really good, and have a lifetime warranty
Chicago Electric
Central Tool
     
others??
