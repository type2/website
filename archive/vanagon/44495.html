Subject:  Gas Smell: Flange to Filler Tube

My 75 Campmobile smells of  gas when full and I recently checked the
flange/seal to the filler tube and have noticed it is cracked and split.  This
connects with four screws to the body of the bus at the filler cap. Has
any one replaced this. It is like a 3 inch seal of some sort.  Will this solve
my problem or will I find that where the filler tube connects to my gas
tank more corroded rubber. Will I have to drop the engine?  Can I continue
to drive with 1/2 to 3/4 a tank of gas. I really would not like to see my bus
burn up. I have recieved some suggestions, I would appreciate many
more.  Hope everyone had a nice weekend.
