     I have an oak/metal roof rack that came off a '67 camper.  I sold the
     the camper and the person didn't want the rack so he could get it
     cheaper.  It is the original rack, not a replica.  It has the original
     wood.  It is not crack or dryrotted.  One slat is warped SLIGHTLY
     because the of the hold down screw coming loose.  It has the ser. #
     plate on it showing it as an original from Germany.  Make an offer.
