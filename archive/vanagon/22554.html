Subject: Need more Eurovan Advice

Again, thanks to all who have  helped so far.

I just made a find, I think.

I've been looking for an MV or a GL.
So far here are my choices.

'93 GL, 32,000 miles, $15,600 near or at bottom price
'93 MV, 36,000 miles, $17,000 maybe less?
'93 MV, 30,000 miles, $17,400 probably at bottom price

Here's the question, I just found a '93 MV, 52,000 miles, but they are 
only asking $14,000.  This cost fits my wallet much better.

Does anybody have a Eurovan with those kind of miles, any problems?

As always, your opinion is invaluable.
