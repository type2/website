Subject: EVs, MV and the pseudo-grave of Belushi


Well, its obvious that I'm back...yes, I agree with some of you...I
wasn't away long enough! Tuesday night, after intently watching the
progress of Hurricane Felix, we drove to Woods Hole and loaded the
EV on the ferry to Martha's Vinyard...about 45 minutes later we 
were off loaded and &quot;on island&quot; (a native term describing where
you are...either &quot;on island (Martha's Vinyard) or &quot;off island&quot;
(everywhere else in the universe)).

The genisis for this trip started some 110+ years ago when a
group of religious practitioners decided summering on the Vinyard
would be &quot;spiritual&quot;. They bought some land in Oak Bluffs, erected
a Tabernacle, and the flocks came and erected tents. Over the
years, the tents became shacks, and the shacks became the so-called
&quot;gingerbread houses&quot; (so called because of their design and ornamentation).

One night each summer the residents would hang candles and japanese 
lanterns on the front of their houses...that became a tradition
called &quot;illumination night&quot;. Illumination night became so popular
that it has become a &quot;semi-secret&quot; on the island. The last time
the night for illumination night was announced over 30,000 people
came into the little campground. So for the past few years or
so the &quot;exact&quot; night (actually the 3rd Wednesday of August) is
not announced until the week before...so much for secrets.

Anyway, our next door neighbors own two gingerbread houses..
one from each of their respective families. You see their
families summered on the Vinyard, owned houses, they got
married...etc.. So we were invited to see illumination night. All
in all it was an interesting, people watching experience.

We had two missions on this trip over and above illumination night...
the first to spend an afternoon at one of the island's clothing
optional beach...well, that was my wife's idea. Felix took care
of that...all the south facing beaches on the island (cooincidentially
where all the C.O.B.s were) were closed due to high surf...

The second mission (also my wife's idea...prodded on by people
at her place of employment...the local crisis intervention center)
was to find the grave of John Belushi. So off we went, guided by
our semi-island-native neighbors. Yes, we found the beaches, and
we also found the pseudo-grave of John Belushi.

Pseudo-grave you ask?? Yes, pseudo-grave. You see the grave has
become sort of a shrine. When we got there, the headstone was
covered with an interesting looking mushroom, a couple of
cigarettes (smoked and not smoked), some pocket change, a
N.O.R.M.L. brochure, a sea-shell, and a still cold bottle
of beer.

Oh yeah, the pseudo-grave stuff... The &quot;grave&quot; is right by the
entrance to the cemetary in Chilmark...suspiciously close to
the entrance in fact. It seems that so many people
visit the grave (evidenced by the worn path to the site, and
the lack of grass (of the lawn variety) around the headstone that
the cemetary folks asked the Belushi family if the headstone
could be moved to a more public, less damaging spot in the
cemetary.

Originally the headstone sat atop John's actual grave...which
was deep inside the back part of the cemetary...as the touristes
came, the cemetary suffered...so the headstone was moved, the 
body stayed where it was originally burried. So that's the story
of the pseudo-grave of Belushi. I also have it from a good source
that Elvis isn't really burried in Graceland...its just a ploy
to get people to pay good money to see the place...


Oh yeah, EV on MV content...there were lots of loaves and vanagons
of both the regular and Westy varieites...one of the car rental
places has a fleet of clapped out Things and bug converts for
rent...but we saw one EV weekender, and two other MVs on MV.
