&gt; 	Steven, weren't you the person I was sort of sparing about the
&gt; 	vitrues of VW, recently?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Hah! We're in a similar place as the goddesses say....
&gt; 
&gt; 	I NEED a pickup for my gardening. I'm stuck. No pickup. No
&gt; 	bricks. No Fertilizer.

I've told some of my friends that if I got a used truck, the first thing I'd
do is fill it up with manure and drive it through fast-food drive-throughs
car washes, snooty neighborhoods, park it in an indoor garage like at the
Mall...you get the idea.  

&gt; 
&gt; 	I refuse to haul shit like that in my '91 camper. And, I refuse,
&gt; 	can not actually, haul that shit in my workcar (93 Escort).
&gt; 
&gt; 	Less than an hour ago, I took $21,000 for my camper from (2) perfectly
&gt; 	nice folks from Medford, OR..
&gt; 
&gt; 	My workcar (Squert) is posted in the local rag.
&gt; 
&gt; 	By next weekend I'll have that honeywagon!!
&gt; 
&gt; 	I shall haul shit through the streets!!!!!!!!!!!

In more ways than one.  How could you DO such a thing!?!  There are always
work-arounds.  $21K isn't bad though. :P  I don't know man.  I just derive
too many good things from the camper.  And for my up-coming job change, I
will probably need it more.  I will be working longer hours on a more regular
bases.  I will also be finishing the (other) house and won't need to haul
anything for a while (knock on wood).  As I implied before, the truck would
have to be a third (3rd) car.

Good Luck...

Steven
