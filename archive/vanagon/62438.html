yup. that's what it says:

&quot;1985 Discovery Volkswagen Camper, LT400, imported, self-contained, loaded,
 new motor, 6-cyl., diesel, 5 spd., 18 mpg, brakes, tires, winch, shower,
 stove, sleeps 5, many extras, parts, all paper work, parts all avail. in
 US, $18,700 obo  (818) 735-7963&quot;

which is, i think, a Burbank, CA area code. this is the much larger van,
built by VW and MAN (of Austria). it looks somewhat like the Vanagon/T3,
but is larger. an LT400 (they start at LT250, i think) is a BIG truck. :)

might be worth a look-see, if you live in the area. :)
