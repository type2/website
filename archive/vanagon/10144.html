To import an automobile into the US, it must meet the US standards 
as of the date the automobile was manufactured, not designed. Alas, the 
Brazilian busses are not importable, without *major* mods.  Some will be 
impossible.  Finding &quot;DOT&quot; lenses for the lights might be possible if 
they really did reuse the mid-70's fixtures, but installing 1995 site 
impact protection (and certifying it by crashing a couple of vans) and 
getting an airbag system installed would drive the cost *way* beyond 
reality.  I looked into this back a bit when I lusted after an East 
German &quot;Carboard Car&quot;.  Even getting a cerifiable manufacture date proved 
impossible.  If you want a car that was manufactured outside the US and 
it was not on the road by Jan 1, 1968, and the owner does not have good 
records, you are setting yourself up for major heartbreak.  Even with 
all the record, it will still cost a minimum of ~$1500 for certification 
through one of the few DOT licensed importers.
