Subject: Re: Battery Purchases

All this speak of buying batteries reminds me of when I went to get a 
new battery for my '71 Bus. (Turned out to be a bad positive clamp)

At the FLAPS, they looked up my bus in the computer, said I needed the
550 CCA model, type 'A' , on sale for $39.00. We went over to the rack,
and saw a whole lone of 550 CCA batteries. Types 'A' through 'E'.

The Type 'A' weighed about 35 lbs. The type 'E' wieghed about 55 lbs.
Both were rated at 550 CCA. Both were the same price. I told the guy
that I wanted the model 'E'. He said the computer says model 'A'.

Well,, many foul and uncivilized words were traded as I tried to explain
that a battery that weighs half again as much, has about twice the
lead surface area and acid volume was the one for me. Fir the same price.

Now, this may be a problem for a Honda Civic, whose engine compartment
is too small to store a dipstick rag, but I can carry a case of oil
on ONE side of the engine compartment. The only thing I was worried about was
the structural integrity of the 'Blessed' (Holy) metal under the current
battery. So some 3/4 inch plywood later, I jacked that heavy mother
in there, and all was peachy.

I have since left the lights on for two days straight, and still fired 
the car right up! 

Dont let them sell you the battery that the computer or book says is for your
car. Get the most CCAs you can afford, then get the biggest battery that
will still fit the vehicle. Most books  list a smaller one.
