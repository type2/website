&gt; &gt;I'm planing to convert my 82 diesel to a TDI. Anybody out there done
&gt;anything
&gt; &gt;similar? I've got a source for the new engine. I'm thinking I'll have to
&gt;swap

I've been checking into this myself and I've found you need to get a complete
engine and the electronic brain with all the sensors and wiring.  I'm waiting
until I can buy a complete wrecked Passat donor car or a reasonably priced
complete 1.9 TDI package from someone who knows what they are doing.

&gt; &gt;the tranny also to take advantage of the new power. I've got a line on a 5
&gt; &gt;speed, from an '84, but i understand that,  that trans has about the same
&gt; &gt;final drive as the 4 speed. You just get a granny first gear ( plus
&gt; &gt;lockup???). Any experienced tranny folks out there? I seem to be on a
&gt;mission
&gt; &gt;to do this. 
&gt;Thanks,

I've driven two diesel Vanagons, one with a four speed and one with a five
speed.  It seems the five speed will give 5 to 10 mph faster highway speeds.

I'd like to hear what salvage yards are asking for complete TDI engines with
everything else that's required to do the swap in a Vanagon.
