 Subject: '71 VW Bus for sale (not camper)

  I am selling a '71 non camper Bus.  I am asking $450, obo.  It is very
  solid, but needs restoration.  The engine is out.  I bought the van from a
  guy that had it sitting in his garage for more that 10 years.  That is why
  it is so solid.
  I am located in Richmond, VA.
  Tim :)
