Subject: 97 EV differences

I had a chance to look at a  a '97 EV more closely yesterday while on the
ferry.
I do like the changes they made to the inside:
- real handles integrated into the 'A' pillars on both sides;
- rear heat duct behind passenger seat;
- cover for the stowed tables to prevent the tops from rattling;
- shoulder belts for the rear seat (well maybe - they're sorta in the way);
- a pair of incandescent lights along the ceiling instead of that flourescent;
- an &quot;on-demand&quot; water pump instead of that stupid switch;
- different dash panel - 4 rotary controls instead of the 2 sliders;
- different middle seat mounts - small round holes with plugs in them;

On the outside, the only differences were:
- white bumpers;
- small &quot;Winnebago Industries&quot; sticker on poptop (looks peelable);
- longer, more rounded nose.

The owner said he had driven both the 5 and the 6 and didn't notice *that*
much difference, at least on the low-end. (He barely had this one broken in
so hadn't really revved it up yet.)
Also, the notorious refrigerator had a &quot;level&quot; problem - something inside
was installed in the wrong position, making the fridge impossible to light
in any condition but level.

I'd really like to switch water pumps in mine - I really hate having to use
that dumb switch, and I hate how much noise the pump makes. My old Vanagon
had a nice hand pump - quiet and it was hard to waste water. I'm not sure
if the on-demand pumps require a different faucet - this one clearly had
one different than mine.
