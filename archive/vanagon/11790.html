Subject: Getting at the Rear heater -- '87 Weekender

I need to get at the rear heater (87 weekender with bed).  Problem is that
the bar upon which the seat pivots is in the way of getting the heater cover
off.  Does the whole seat mechanism have to come out just to get the cover
off?  I'm in Digest mode so please 'cc:' me or e-mail direct.  Thanks.
