&gt;I am wondering if anyone knows what hardware was used in the

I saw a '74 bus in the junkyard (Jack Stafford was there, maybe he
remembers too?) that had been modified to carry (I assume) a wheelchair.  A
good portion of the floor from behind the front seats to behind the sliding
door had been lowered at least 8 inches!  Custom welded, of course.  I
assume they just used some small ramps at that point.
