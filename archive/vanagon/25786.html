Subject: RE: Identify address of sender


&gt;There was a recent message about changing settings in Windows to prevent 
the
&gt;address of a message sender from being stripped from the message.  How do I 

&gt;access the archives and revisit this message?  I'd like to be able to
&gt;respond directly to a message sender (when it's most appropriate), rather
&gt;than bothering the whole mailing list.  Thanks in advance...


I got a note from another fellow, saying:

Add the following line to the [Options] section of MSMAIL.INI:

StripGatewayHeaders=0

MS Mail will then pass along all the message headers.

BTW, that's a zero at the end, not a letter O. Anyone have any clues
how to make this work with Windows NT?


I found my msmail.ini file didn't have an &quot;Options&quot; section, so I put this
line in my &quot;msmail&quot; section. It worked!
