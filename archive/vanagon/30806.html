Subject: Early Christmas in Maryland!

Hello all,

  I got a van!  I need some information to make my life complete.

1.  How do I become a regular of this fine list?

2.  What exactly do glowplugs do?  (yep, it's an 83 diesel westphalia)  
Do they function when the engine is warm?...i.e. help combustion?

3.  What is the number of J.C. Whitney?

4.  When draining oil and replacing the oil pan bolt is there a gasket 
that needs to be bought and replaced, or is it a reusable gasket?

5.  Are ther any other velocity challenged people who can give me hints 
about my new ugly toy.

6.  Does anybody out there have a set of spoke type wheels that fit a 
vanagon?  I saw them on a 1980 and they really look cool.  I want a set 
really bad!

Thanks for all the help!

Jimbo
