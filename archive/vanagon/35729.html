&gt; I am progressing on my '72 camper, but the distributor is a

&gt; suggest the timing should be set at? All the books say 5 degree ATDC - but
&gt; this assumes there is a vacuum module attached. I have it running at about
&gt; 0 at idle, but am dissatisfied with the &quot;load&quot; response if the RPM are not
&gt; high. Also, does anyone have any specs what the overall mechanical advance
&gt; range should be? It looks like this one is running about 20 degrees advance
&gt; when I rev it up. BTW, thought I had an alternator problem (light stays on),
&gt; but found out last night that the PO had wired the high beam indicator to
&gt; that! Oh, the tangled webs we weave when first we practice to hack up
&gt; wiring.

I run my '72 w/ Bosch 009 at about 10 degrees before top dead center, runs
great.  Total advance at speed should be around 30 degrees BTDC.

And I have to remember that when I time my stock '73 that I have to set
the idle timing at 10 degrees *after* top dead center.  20 degrees
difference, wow.

Works fer me,
