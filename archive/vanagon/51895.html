Subject: Re: Ignorant glow plug question

The cable is actually advancing the timing inside the pump. MAkes for
smoother running when cold. Don't worry if you forget it and leave it out.
The overall timing advance of the pump is greater than the amount added when
pulling out the advance, no harm done.

&gt;On a '82 diesel Westy, what does the pull out cold start lever actually do??  I
&gt;looked at the injection pump where the cable attaches and did not see any
&gt;electrical connections.  I used to think that this lever actuated the glow
&gt;plugs, but now I don't see how it could.  What does it do and are the glow
&gt;plugs controlled by a relay, independently??

&gt;Thanks for your patient help.
