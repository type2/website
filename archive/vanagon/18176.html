Subject: 59 update, FAQ question, Manasses Bugout question

Troy and I where going to test drive the pick up, we started to bleed the
brakes and one of the drivers front wheel cylinders popped, oh well fix it
tonight. We are having electrical problems, headlights and turn signals wont
work yet and the gen. light isnt working, oil light works fine though, also
the highbeam indicator isnt working now, I'll check the fusses again. The
new (used) gas tank is secure and the engine runs good. Looks like we need a
new $muffler$, man 36hp parts are costly. All in All we hope to test run
thursday.

I cruised the FAQ qt the gopher site, man thats a lot of info, but where
exactly will I find info on the 6-12 volt conversion.

Does any body know exactly where the manasses bugout is: what road? what
speedway, is it a farmers field, where the heck is this thing? and what day
sat or sun is it, please help on this one

thanx
jason

PS. the bug is running cool now, but my bus has a leak aroud the oil cooler.
There is always something to do.
