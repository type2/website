Subject: Core charge for Vanagon Transmission?

Hi all:

I bought a transmission at a wreaking yard yesterday, but since I'm
not going to pull it 'till next week, I paid the yard owner up front
to &quot;hold&quot; it for me.  As we were settling up he causually mentioned
that I could pay the core charge when I actually come back to get it.

It never occured to me that there might be a core charge on a piece
bought at a wreaking yard.  Is this normally done on rebuildable
parts?  What's a reasonable core charge in this situation?

Thanks.
