And what, you may ask, is a brain fart? it's when you get up to go into
&gt;another room to get something, but as soon as you walk through the door,
&gt;you can't recall why you came into the room. it's when you do something
&gt;and instantly realize that you knew better than to do that. just a little
&gt;involuntary expulsion of brain waves. :)
