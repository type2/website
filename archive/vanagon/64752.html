My ex '93 EV MV also tended to eat tires out of round, especially the original
tires. Since at about 10,000 they were lumpy, but had lots of tread, I had
them shaved round and rebalanced. They stayed pretty true until they wore out.
I also had the alignment done after the initial problem - rear &quot;couldn't&quot;
quite be brought into spec &amp; front was off &quot;as received&quot; but was easy to
adjust once we figured out the new procedures.

Over the last 30 years on many different cars I've noticed some tire brands
seem to go out-of-round more than others. Tire hop is also often to blame
depending on spring &amp; shock rates, wheel balance and load carried. Also be
sure you haven't bumped a rim into a warp. Good HD shocks help in many cars -
check with Bus Depot for EV shocks - he started listing them after I had him
get me a set. (Then I suddenly traded the car just before the front Bilsteins
arrived. Think Ahead)

On my '93 non-camper I put Pirelli P300s on with pretty good results. This was
a 44 psi non-reinforced tire with good load rating. However it was replaced
with the P400 (according to NTW) which is 36psi (some are 40) with lower load.
Michelin still makes reinforced tires for the VW vans, but they aren't a true
&quot;C&quot; 6-ply high-pressure tire. With a loaded EV Camper pushing 6000 lb you want
all the tire you can get. I now have a '97 VR6 camper and also wonder what
tires I'll find - but that's a year or two away.

I have a 95 EV Camper.  At 10,000 miles, a thumping began in the rear.
I noticed irregular tire wear.  Took it to an alignment specialist and
they said the rear end was within VW specs.  I have rotated tires
every 5 to 7 thousand miles, and with 26,000 miles on tires, the noise
and irregular wear is as bad as ever. If anyone has any suggestions, I
would be obliged.  Also, if anyone knows of a replacement tire other
than the Goodyear G 64, please let me know. &lt;snip&gt;
