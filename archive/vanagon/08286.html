&gt; rear).  Gosh!  I never named the thing!  That's why, right after cleaning,
&gt; the vanagon will always spray oil out again and make me clean it's rear.

For those like Stuart who have leaking seals due to blow-by, a powder
cleanser like Bab-o or Comet works very nicely at removing the offending
oil from tha back window and hatch. It did not scratch my paint
surface at all, and left it shiny clean to accept the next load of oil.

Oil from diseasel engines is really gucky (technical term).

Since I had the newer engine put in, I haven't had to clean it since.

p.s. Stuart--don't replace the seals. I spent $250 on new seals when
I should have spent it on a newer engine.

ppss NAPA has a lifetime warranted muffler for the D.V. I paid $120 installed
     for it (from my FLAG)
