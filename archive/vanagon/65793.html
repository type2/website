Subject:      Fuel Pump-Replace?

I am going to drop the fuel tank this week on my '84 1.9 to replace the
fuel lines and filter.  Should I go ahead and replace the fuel pump at the
same time?  The fuel pump is working and isn't making any unusual noises,
and a replacement is pricey.  I have no idea as to the history behind the
vehicle, but it seems to have been well maintained.  I bought it with 122k
on it and I'm slowly replacing everything as money comes in hand.  I will
be taking a 2500 mile round trip voyage to the Atlantic Provinces at the
end of October.  Items replaced so far:

Complete new engine with new clutch, alternator, distributor
CVs repacked and boots replaced
Coolant system flushed and filled
New front rotors, wheel bearings, brake pads.
Synthetic lube put in transmission.
New master and slave clutch cylinders
New tires and alignment

After reading about Jim Mitchells recent experience, I plan on getting a
rebuilt airflow meter and used ECU to use as spares, and the fuel pump will
put me over budget.  All three are currently working properly (knock on
wood), but of the three, which is most likely to fail and leave me stranded?

TIA
