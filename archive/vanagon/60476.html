&gt; Saw the initial post, and this response.  I think the coolant problems
&gt; warrant more than disregarding.  There IS a problem, sounds like the
&gt; internal head gasket leak (worst case) or a bad pressure cap (best case)
&gt; 
&gt; bye, Tim

I think the key here is 'everything ran fine'.  Continue to monitor the
coolant level, if everything continues to be fine, I don't think there
is a problem.

&gt; &gt; I drove home from there (about 4 miles) and watched the gauge all the way.
&gt; &gt; It was in the normal area and the van ran fine.  Do I need to worry about
&gt; &gt; this?
&gt; 
&gt; Nope.
&gt; 
&gt;  Does this fan just come on when the engine is overheating?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I live in Texas, and I only here it on hot days stuck in traffic.
&gt; 
&gt;  How do
&gt; &gt; you keep from loosing the coolant?
&gt; 
&gt; Don't put so much in.
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^  what! ???????????????
&gt; 
&gt;  Why have I never heard this fan
&gt; &gt; before????
&gt; 
&gt; You are a Yankee!
&gt; 
&gt; Ahem, but aren't you all Yankees?
&gt; Time to go cook some back bacon now.
&gt; See ya, eh?   A. Canuck
