Subject: Re: 86 Vanagon start problem


I had a similar problem with my old '71 bus. Lucky the ground clearance was
good enough that I could slide under the bus and short the starter terminals
to turn the engine over (making sure the parking brake was on and the van was
in neutral.)

I was told that the problem is a starter solenoid that is going bad. Driving
around heats up the solenoid just enough so that it binds in the housing. In
old busses with less than optimal current reaching the solenoid, the condition
is aggravated.Since you do not get enough ommph to counteract the binding.
The solution, I was told is to replace the solenoid.

Of course no one wanted to sell a solenoid, just ones with rebuilt starter
attached. One word of caution. Most FAPs will sell one rebuilt starter for all
VWs - even though the ones in the bus are heavier-duty. It does make it fun to
return half a dozen starters until you get the correct one.

For me, replacing the started and solenoid cured the problem.
