Subject: Question for anyone at BBTA

If anyone is at Busses by the Arch and talks to Everywhere Ed (O'Donnell)
can you ask him when he thinks he'll be back on Long Island?  I need to
get some stuff from him and I think he's planning on being away for a
while.  Thanks a lot and tell him Erik (that's me) says hello.  Sorry for
the waste of bandwidth.
-Erik
