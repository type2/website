&gt; Questions, anyone, would my 86 westy operate ok without the cat
&gt; converter?  No emmissons test here. The exhust tips would come closer to
&gt; the center for me if that were the case. Would the tips clear the tow
&gt; hook bumper hitch?

ED:  If you remove the cat, my guess is the brackets for the S&amp;S muffler
won't line up correctly.  Here's the cure:
At your local welding shop, split the cat, remove the contents and
reweld or
with a long chisel, make the cat flow through.

Now these operations have legal questionability, beware there is an
oxygen sensor attached to the cat, and performing one of the operations
will change the reading.  I have no idea of that impact on the FI
system.

anonymous for fear the big asshole is out there
