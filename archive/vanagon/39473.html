I built a 1800cc high perf. upright for my '71 westy. The late Gene Berg

in a bus and the bigger bores will crack, warp, break, etc.  I TRUST him.
I used all new internal parts, balanced and blueprinted.  It works...WELL.


My advice is to limit the size of the pistons and look into longer strokes
and expensive dellorto carbs.  Also higher flowing heads.  But most
importantly, get a NEW case, not an alignbored one.  I have NO confidence
in them and I see no reason to screw around on a project like this to save
a few hundred bucks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Friend Richard's 1600dp is almost dead.  In just over a year its gone
&gt;&gt;&gt;from fairly healthy to 1/2 the power of a 1100cc! :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;So he is going to buy a new engine.  Cost no object.  He wants to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be able to crush my 1776.

Red '87 GTI
