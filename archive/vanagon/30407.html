Subject: address change

 Being as my boss has been spending a little too much time watching over my
 shoulder lately &lt;could it be my lack of productivity?&gt; I am going to move
 my vanagon_at_lenti mail over to a screename on my son Nikki's AOL account.

 Folks who want to contact me directly during the week should el free to
 do so at dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com - it's not like they're ready to fire
 me or anything. The new address is westy7ol_dot_com  .


   Dave
