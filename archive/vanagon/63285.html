Subject:      VANAGON list Update

Well, we've survived our first five days. The list changeover from
lenti to gerry went rather seamlessly, although there were momemnts Friday
and Saturday when I was reconsidering what I was getting myself into.
Most, if not all, of our initial admin headaches were related to DEAD and
full mail-box accounts. For the time being (til' Ron, Gerry and I adopt
some new admin policies), all accounts which bounce mail due to full-mail
boxes are 'quietly DELETED after the 2nd day. I'm pretty conscienscious
about ALL my work (paid and unpaid) and reading ALL the error messages
that come my way is included. Who knows, someone may have a legitimate
concern/problem.

IF you are going to be away from email for any period of time, I HIGHLY
RECCOMMEND that you set your subscription options to 'NONMAIL'. This does
not unsubscribe you, but tells the listserv not to deliver mail. You can
then restart mail delivery with a follow-up message, 'MAIL'.

My apologies for not having a better WELCOME/INSTRUCTIONAL PACKAGE sent to
everyone at the time of the changeover. Ron did put something together
initially and has deligently been making additions. Part of this message
and a cheat-sheet were posted by Ron and Gerry a day or so ago. PLEASE
take time to read them, they are IMPORTANT.

Your cheerful neighborhood list admin ...

P.S. Does anyone know how much disk space (mailbox room) COMPUSERVE
clients get with their accounts ?
