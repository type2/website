Subject: Re: Distinguishing between 68-70 busses


Here's a real PITA difference--most unobtrusive, but nonetheless 
interesting.  The '70 uses a bigger clutch cross shaft than the 68/69, 
and better yet, the switch was made mid-year; so a '70 built in August of 69 
has a different one than the '70 built in December '69.    

I found this difference out the hard way.
