Subject: Re: Westy roof add-on to Syncro


&gt;My top is solid.  I don't understand
&gt;the argument about it not being strong enough since Westfalia
&gt;essentially does the same conversion that was done on mine.... In fact,
&gt;the ridges in the roof are set up for the opening to be cut.

You may cut the whole thin sheet of a Vanagon roof except the front
third. If you have to cut the top frame rails you have to add them
at same position, but maybe extended into the high to fit a fibre
high roof, as an example. This is also done at westfalia high roof
campers.

&gt;I would guess it could be a $1000-$2000 for the top.

Pop Tops and add-on fibre high roofs costs DM 1000.- to DM 2,000.- as
new. Not as expensive as you thought. Ready to weld in frame rail
extensions are available for different fibre high roofs.
