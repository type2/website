Subject: Re: 80 Vanagon Accelerator Cable Sticking

It's worth pulling out the entire cable and sheath, it will all come out via
the spare tire well. Not bad, just fiddly.  Had to do this on the last '85,
it wasn't just water, it was 8 years of water and fine silt, nice mud that
froze solid.  Once thawed in the basement I pulled out the cable and WD-40
blasted it and tube.  Let it all set then wiped of the cable and put it back
through and SECURELY tied a bit of rag to one end and pulled it through.
Took about 5 tries to get the inside of the sheath white instead of brown.
Apply WD-40 to the rag.  It gave a great smooth throttle when back in, after
soaking the cable in 10W30, amazing what I'd gotten used too over the years.
Removed the extra return spring I'd added on the throttle body too!  bye, tim
