Subject: Good Karma

What I enjoy most about reading the postings in this list is that I can
identify with so many of the stories and problems. Yep, been there, done that.
Back in '78 I bought a '69 VW camper and shipped it to Europe. My girlfriend
and I began a trip that we both have described as the best year of our lives.
We suffered through our share of misfortunes and breakdowns but it was an
experience I will never forget. When I read about the plans being made to pick
up and go, I yearn to get back to my gypsy roots and just take off (alas,
child support and the real world come crashing down...) Anyway, I thought I
would pass on a quote that to me sums up the VW Karma:

&quot;How much we enjoy what we have is more important than how much we have. Life
is full of people who have more than they know what to do with, but cannot be
content. It is the capacity to enjoy life that brings contentment.&quot; - unknown
