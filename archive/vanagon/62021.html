Subject: More bussi for me...(soon to be..:)


Well, today i've mostly decided that i WILL be getting this mid 60's 
Kombi that i know of....virtually no rust, been sitting 10+ years...

no engine though..:(

So it will sit, along with the rest of my projects...
(unless i end up selling it, which is a good posibility...)

And....went and helped a friend with his fiberglass body buggy (got the 
engine running nice and smooth like....now he's got to finish the pan, 
and tomorrow we do the brakes, then next weekend we put the body on, and 
shim it up good.......then off to the paint shop..:)

Anyhow!

I was talking with his dad, about the ones that got away, and the ones 
that havent yet...(his dad currently has 4 things and a baja.....:)

And he told me about this coworker of his wifes 88 Vanagon that he could 
get for 300 bucks...(yep, 300 bucks!) The guy says it has a porshe motor 
in it, but i think he's nuts...:) (he's the original owner, and he's 
selling (and its been sitting) because he cant stop it from running hot..

Hell, says I, i'd pay 300 bucks for a straight rust free 
vanagon...(particularly an 88!!!:)

So OJ's dad proceedes to tell me where it sits (i'm gonna go look at it 
tomorrow, i hope...:), and we drift off to other things...like how bad he 
wants to get his things running again (well, the two white ones...one 
needs a head, the other needshead-retorquing, both need tune ups...)

And he mentions buyin the bus (er...vanagon..:) for me, in exchange for 
the work..hmm!!! SOLD!!:)

So....if this guy is nuts about it having a porshe engine, i'm gonna have 
a wasser on my hands......else i'll have &quot;somthing&quot;:)

We'll see, i guess...

Ah....later....david
