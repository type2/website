Yes, Cousin Mike found another bus worthy to join alongside his 
Deluxe.

I just got off the phone with a fellow in the next town over, and 
tonight I drop off the check to pick up my new '59 Singlecab!  
Woo-hoo!
congrats!    

I saw it last night and was very impressed.  It's been in a garage 
for the last 10 years and has been a restoration project of a fellow ....

 The paint is the 
origianl reddish colored (not sealing wax) but more red.

if the original colour of a 59 is reddish, it would be sealing wax red,
common for late 50s commerical vws.    If it was in a garage, it might not
have faded to the light pinky colour as it tends to.     i suggest polishing
the dash to all happy drivers of buses of this beautiful and hard as h*ll to
copy colour bus the delight of polishing the dash, to see it's glory come
through and stop calling it peach, salmon, orange or pink.  

guess what colour my first split was?
