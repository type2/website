Subject: $70 muffler strap? 1.9L
Date: Wed, 9 Apr 1997 18:51:41 +0000

I installed new exhaust pipe and muffler on my '84 vanagon 1.9L.

My local VW dealer quoted $68.45 for the metal strap that supports the
muffler and attaches to a bracket and bracing on the passenger side of the
engine. 

Is there a good substitute. I have it temporarily supported with &quot;plumbers
tape.&quot; 
I'm concerned about the muffler rubbing against the exhaust pipe between #2
&amp; #4 cylinders.
There is little to no clearence.

Thanks,
