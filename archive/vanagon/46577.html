Subject: *THE GREAT SPLITTY DEBATE*


You know, when I first subscribed to the vintagvw 'serv, I honest to god 
thought that all air cooled vw's would be talked about there.  I was kind 
of confused as to why only Beetles are the mainstay.  But I soon found out
that the bus people had their own 'serv.  Great - now I could subscribe 
to 2 lists.  Wow!  What could I say...the volume of the vanagon 'serv rocked!

I am still quite puzzled as to why there aren't just 2 main 'servs like 
acldvw and h20vw or something to that effect.  Aircooled busses have a 
LOT in common with beetles and so one would reasonably expect that those 
2 would go together because for simple efficiency sakes, more people 
would benefit from any given message.

Now of course I am speaking my opinion and that ain't worth a hill of 
beans, but I fail to see what aircooled VW's and watercooled VW's have in 
common that warrants putting them both in the same 'serv - other than the 
fact that they are used for campers (the busses).

I'm trying to speak from the vantage point of how each message on a 
listserv benefits the recipients.  It does get kind of bothersome at 
times having to delete messages that have to do with post-80 busses as 
they don't interest me.  What I want is aircooled VW Bus info but I have 
to wade through a bunch of unrelated material until I find it.  

So based on that fact, I think the seperation is warranted.  However, I 
can plainly see if someone is subscribed to the 'serv merely for the 
comraderie, then certainly the vanagon 'serv should be left alone.

I percieve the split as method of &quot;net efficiency&quot; and &quot;courtesy&quot; to each 
other.  We don't want to split because we're mad at each other, we want 
to split to make it easier on everyone.

What do you think?
