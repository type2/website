Subject: RE: Pwr Brake Vac Hose (was RE: Idle Probs)


&gt;&gt;I've also heard, that ordinary heater hose works-- I don't have to use
&gt;&gt;the hugely expensive ribbed vacuum hose, so the story goes. I will get
&gt;&gt;the 1/2&quot; heater hose, and give it a try. It IS pretty stout looking.
&gt;
&gt;I tried experimenting with various hoses and solicited the group for
&gt;opinions while I was resurrecting my power brakes last month.  I would NOT
&gt;use regular heater hose since there is a chance it might collapse and
&gt;surprise you one day while braking.  I am using Wire Reinforced 1/2&quot; heater
&gt;hose (made by Gates--a.k.a. shape to fit hose).  It's as tough as the VW
&gt;vacuum hose but much cheaper.

Where did you get it?


&gt;It's a good idea to get a new rubber grommet on the firewall where the
&gt;vacuum hose passes through if yours is missing/dried out.  The metal edge 
on
&gt;the hole in the firewall could saw through your hose with all the engine
&gt;vibration.

Was this from VW? Or aftermarket, or HW store etc?
