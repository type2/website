Subject: Difficult Conditions doc update

Just to let everybody who wanted me to make a copy of the &quot;journeys under 
difficult conditions&quot; document for them that, because of the response, 
I've decided to hold off on copying until the digest people have a chance 
to respond.

And seeing as I'm taking off camping again for the weekend (free camping 
at the Hot Spring near Pemberton, BC if anyone wants to join me) and 
won't be back until Monday evening, I'll give everyone until 7:30am 
Pacific time Tuesday July 11 to tell me they want in before I run to the 
copy shop and run a kazillion copies.

This means the Canadian maniacs should have their copies by the beginning 
of the week of July 17, with our American friends receiving theirs about a 
week later.
