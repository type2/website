&gt; Question:
&gt;  
&gt;  I'ee seen prices for water cooled head gasket replacment in the range of
$1,
&gt; 500-$2,000 from 
&gt;  various postings. WOW!
&gt;  
&gt;  Why so expensive?  I have not seen what head costs, yet.

I've seen similar prices, up to $2,300 at a VW dealer.  These prices include
2 new heads.  The heads are a significant portion of the price and whithout
them, the gasket replacement alone should cost much less.

Good luck,
