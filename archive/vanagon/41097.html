&gt;I remember they were on at one time, but with an AOL address, so Bob's
&gt;your uncle...

When I ordered my parts a few weeks ago ('60 dddPanel - rear shift coupling
and two front door inner handles) I believe that the owner or manager
picked up the phone. Quite personable and actually chatted quite awhile.
And he was paying for the call on the 800 number.

He told me the handles were back-ordered and the coupling should be there
in a week.  The coupling was here in a week, and the handles still haven't
shown (three weeks now).  Since I live and breathe email I sent a message
to &lt;busboys_at_aol_dot_com&gt; to make sure that they remembered me and I haven't
heard anything yet.  I'm not truly desperate for the handles (4&quot; Vice-Grips
do quite well) I'm not worried yet.

Judging from the (non)response to my email to &quot;him&quot;, I'd say a
conglomerated list of complaints sent to &lt;busboys_at_aol_dot_com&gt; might not be the
best bet.  Hand delivery should do it.

He realizes that we're out here, and knows how much traffic we generate.
That's why he dropped off of the list - too much to deal with (at aol rates).

There's a good chance that a stout warning of their reputation sliding will
make things better.

I wish I'd remembered to ask for the VANAGON discount :-( ...
