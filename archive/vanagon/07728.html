Subject: Tie rod adjustment

I was poking around under my '71 Baywindow the other day and noticed
(not for the first time) that my right side tie rod was bent.
(A few bangs into the curb or something) So I tried to loosen the
nuts at the adjuster part and give it a turn or two to lengthen
it. Well, I loosened the nuts, put a pipe wrench on it, and TRIED
to turn it. Nothing.

A little liquid wrench, two pipe wrenches, some strong language, etc.
and it still would not budge.

The problem: To get any leverage, I have to use a 15 inch pipe wrench.
It is too long to swing under the car, and I cant get the leverage
on it that I want. If I jack the car up and put it on stands,
it may not be stable enough to start yanking on it. Also, I dont want
to torque the little ball joints at the ends, or thier mounting locations.

What should I do to get it to turn? How hard can I pull before I bugger
the tie rod ends? Any experience?

On a related note: I am saving the bread to fix the bearings and
bushings in my front beam. Does anybody know what a used front beam
would cost? How about a front beam all the way to the spindles? How
about just the bushings, bearings, etc, plus labor to put them in?
I have no clue about the costs, and my local buggie barn is out of
comission while they move to another location.
