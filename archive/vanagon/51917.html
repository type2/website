&gt; Do you need to bleed air out of the system after replacing this sensor, or is
&gt; it just plug and chug?

Very definately need to bleed system.  Mine lost a good 2 gallons of
coolant.  Refilled expansion and refill tanks, bled a while, stopped
van, readded to expansion and refill tanks, bled ...  Bled for a good 30
minutes before bubbles finally stopped.  After it cooled off completely,
refill tank was empty again and expansion tank half empty.  Filled up
again and probably should bleed again but haven't yet (on most important
to do list--haven't driven van yet).

It is very simple to replace though.  If I can do it, anyone can.  And
for only about $11 (including new o-ring), if in doubt, replace.
