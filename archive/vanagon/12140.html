Subject: Help, my bus has fallen and can't get up!!

On lunch break today my bus stopped running. I noticesd a peculiar
hesitation when accelerating yesterday. Today it got worse, as if it
were misfiring or not getting enough gas. I pulled over, checked for
leaky air hoses, connections, double relay wires, even point gap...still
nothing. At first it would turn over, run rough a few secs. then die. 
Then there were two big backfires and now it won't start, just turns over.

I checked the stator flap, what else can I try before calling a tow truck?
The brief history as I know it follows; Oct 94, new pushrods and seals,
Dec. 94 new pistons, rings, cylinders and heads. Ran good except for fuel
pump running with key off-- double relay wires were shorting, and occasional
stalling at idle which I feel is electrical.

Is there anything I can check before throwing in the towel and my wallet
to have someone tell me the F.I. needs replacing?! 
What about the temp. sensors, clogged fuel filter (but I smell fuel when
turning the engine), and I know it's not out of gas...&quot;I put 59 cents in
two days ago, man...&quot;

BTW I am referring to a 1977 Camper, 2.0 l, w/out hydraulic lifters.

Thanks in advance for any help on the matter!
