Subject: Slow starting when hot

Howdy Volks,

I have had a recent problem where my 85 Westy is sluggish to start when she
is warm.  Doesn't happen all the time.  There really seems to be no pattern
to it.  My starter checked out to be dragging, so I put a new one in two days
ago.  (Thanks Ron).  Sometimes, it won't start at all.  It just goes
'whir,whir' as if it had a dead battery (not the case) or was suffering from
vapor lock.  Anyone have any ideas?
