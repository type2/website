 F.Y.I.   About Isetta cars

In particular for Martha (Busgirl), and  Sam (Sglw_at_aol_dot_com) and others
interested in Isettas --

Somewhere I recall hearing that early Isetta's did not have a reverse gear at
all, and not until later did one become available.

Any of you intested in Isetta basic info, the Autust'95 issue of the BMW Car
Club magazine , &quot;Roundel&quot; has a series of articles about the Isetta in
conjunction with it's 40th birthday.  There a quite a few pictures as well,
including a full color glossy 3/4 (right front fender) shot of a bright red
one.  

Apparently, the roots of the Isetta predate BMWs production, going back prior
to 5 March, '55. &quot;Iso Automotovielto SpA in Milan designed, built, and marked
the original Isetta, or little Lso.  Iso, owned by Renzo Rivolta and son Piero
was a major motorscooter manufacturer with models like the Isoscooter,
Isomoto, and Iso Diva.  the company also produced Isothermos refrigerators. 
Could this have been the inspiration for the front door design?&quot;

To be certain to have some VW content, compared to 36 hp VWs, etc - ...&quot;the
Iso Isetta used a 236cc, two cylinder, two stroke 8 horsepower engine.&quot; &quot; BMW
Isettas used an R25 morotrcycle-based , four stroke, single cylinder...&quot;

Any one interested can contact me, and if not too many of you are interested,
maybe I can copy and mail or fax some of this .

Harvey
