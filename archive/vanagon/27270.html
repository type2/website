Subject: RE: NON VW...electric cars


&gt;Sorry for taking up the bandwidth, but I'm looking for info
&gt;in electric autos.  I've used a net browser to find everything
&gt;I can on the WWW, and now I'd like to know if you folks can turn
&gt;me on to any dealers, owners, outfits that do conversions or sell
&gt;parts/kits, etc.

off-the-shelf parts to convert VW to electric power)

The above info is several years old. Paul Davenport was very knowledgeable
and helpful.
