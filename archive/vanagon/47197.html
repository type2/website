&gt;&gt;&quot;...the car itself was still full of bugs.&quot; -Heinz Nordhoff, 1948, rebuilding
&gt;&gt;the VW after the war.

Was this really written in 1948?  The term &quot;bug&quot; as applied to an engineering
failure/problem, has been credited to Grace Hopper sometime in WWII, but I
am quite suprised that it migrated this far in such a short time!
