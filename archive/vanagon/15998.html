Subject:       RE: Interstate Batteries

Thanks to all who have responded to my questions about Interstate 
batteries.  Looks like we have a winner here, folks.  

The consensus being that the CCA is greater (700 in the Interstate) than in the stock 
Autobahn battery by 200 CCA, and the battery is serviceable (can add 
water), and a good warranty honoured all over North America.

Cheers,
Harry.
