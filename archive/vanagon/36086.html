Subject: 87 Vanagon: missing relay
Date: Sat, 24 Feb 1996 22:00:39 -0800

I was looking at my fuse block today, comparing it to the diagram in 
Bentley (pp 97.102) and noticed that I was missing the 2nd stage radiator 
cooling fan relay. I presume that this is something I should have? Could it 
be located elsewhere? What does this relay do exactly?
