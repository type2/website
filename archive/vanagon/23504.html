&gt; Geez David! The last thing we want on this list is someone with
&gt; principles! But since you agree with the lit flame in the gas station
&gt; argument would you agree that having both propane and gas exposed to a
&gt; flame increases your chances of being blowed up real good no matter how
&gt; infinitely small that increase is? 

I only agree if you are in a gas station.  Outside of a gas station I
still don't believe running the fridge increases the risk of blowing up
one iota.  At least, not yet.

&gt;			So if you are risk acceptant like
&gt; David Garth, you takes your chances, risk averse like Harry Yates and you
&gt; turn off the dial....The question is would you accept those odds with
&gt; someone else on board?

Ooooh, you're pulling out all the stops for this one, eh Dave?  ;)
I think I should have been grouped with Dave G. instead of Harry, and I
would have to let my passenger decide whether *they* believe there is
any risk to running the propane fridge while driving.  Then, if they
don't want to accept the risk, that's up to them.  :)
