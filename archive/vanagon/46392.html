Subject: The split and -fear of Geese- 

Hey Hoov, Whats that smell?

It's FLAMEBAIT! =) Honk!

I have over come my fear of &quot;Geese&quot; but still don't have time to mine my own
ore for the metal and grow my own rubber plants. I usually get the &quot;Spirit&quot;
when a semitruck is up my bumper on long upgrades in 115F heat or when the
injectors hiccup outside of Desert Center, CA. at 3:30 AM. Oh, it was
&quot;grease&quot; Oops sorry!
