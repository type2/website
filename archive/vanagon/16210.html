Subject: '71 Hard Start

Friends;

    As some of you may recall, I was having RED LIGHT syndrome last we spoke,
and since then I replaced the voltage reg. and the red light winked out!!
    BUT! Yesterday, I took Ramona out for a day cruise, and after the third
time starting her back up, she began to crank longer before she'd turn
over...I believe it's only after she's been cruising for a spell since she
always starts up dandy for me at the get-go, after she's been resting for a
bit.
    What should I check for first?? I have already gone back and
double-checked the connections on the regulator. Also, she seems to idle a
bit low when I first start her up....connection???
    Thanks for the input! Have I mentioned you guys are really greeaat?
Without all the letters of encouragement per my generator posting, I don't
think I would've had the confidence to do the procedure on my own, which I
did and now I'm all bloated with the pride of running my very first &quot;Muir
Procedure&quot; !! Thanks again!

Rachel &amp; Ramona
