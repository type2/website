Subject: NATO Crew-cab

	I've seen what was described as an ex-NATO Crew-cab,
most recently with a primered exterior, on Vanagon alloy wheels. 
Earlier, I saw an add in a north-Bay paper for what I think was the
same truck. 

	&quot;NATO spec&quot; in this case seemed primarily to mean
the body was painted olive drab, glossy, with brown interior vinyl.
I didn't see anything else special, though it might have
mountian gears, heavy duty battery/alternator blah blah.
The one I saw was an '76.

	Its a lot like the GMC trucks the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
Marines, Coast Guard, Coast and Geodesic Survey, etc, 
all drive, eg, stripper model with selected heavy-duty parts,
and possibly a unique paint job. All the Army Jimmys have the
same plastic controls and bench seat you can buy yourself.
Engines might be higher output, or lower compression, overload
springs, stiffer shocks. Nothing bullet-proof, and no pintle-mounted
M-60.
