Hi gang-

As you might recall, I recently bought a '67 single cab.  The guy had
the hoops too (no wood, no canvas, just the hoops and protective metal
strip for the wood), but as they were buried under a snowbank at the
time, they weren't part of the sale. We talked about him selling them
to me in the spring, for mebbe $100.  Well, now it's spring, and he
says he's found out that they're worth more than he thought, and now
he wants more like $350. 

So:
  * what are they worth, roughly? (I know, condition, etc...)
  * If they're too rich for my blood (I've got a fair bit of resto to do
before I start worrying about hoops and canvas!), does anybody out
there want me to buy them and resell to you?

I'm in a class all week and not reading the lists, so I would
appreciate direct cc of any responses.  

Thanks,

-Mitch
