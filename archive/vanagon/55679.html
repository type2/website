Subject: Head gasket failure Q

Hi volks,

My 85 Westy is getting combustion gas into the coolant system.  Does this
mean that the problem is failure of the the thin green &amp; black o-rings on the
cylinder jugs and/or the metal spacing rings between the head and the
cylinder jugs?

Are there any other possible causes?
