Subject:      vanagon armrests ...

well, for you folks with the adjustable front seat armrests ...

DON'T BREAK THEM!!! always, always fold them completely UP before trying to
get out of the seat!

&quot;well, of course&quot;, you say dumfoundedly. yeah, well ... some folks (i.e.,
kids) think it's &quot;cool&quot; to leave them down and use them as hand-holds when
getting out or in.

not cool. it seems that there is a metal sleeve in the armrest itself, and
such behavior on the part of the seat occupant tends to weaken and then split
this sleeve. how to fix? ha. welding, maybe. but then the foam rubber will
catch on fire.

buy a new one from the dealer? sure. how much could an armrest cost??
howzabout $130.00 ... that's ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS, folks. for a stinking
little armrest!! (but my favorite dealer says he'll cut me a deal: ONLY $100).
wow.

so, for now, my ex-favorite nephew will have to do without one, and i will
begin looking in the junkyards for a replacement ... and hope they don't know
what one costs. :)

also thinking about putting the old style door-mounted-armrests on my doors ...
but they'd be expensive as well. :(
