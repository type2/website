Subject:      when you think you've seen it all ...

... someone comes along with something new:

Joshua Tree Wood Trim
2525 Arapahoe Avenue, Suite E4-337
Boulder, Colorado 80302
(800) 769-9178  FAX (303) 413-1817
info_at_woodtrim_dot_com

it's wood trim for Vanagons. yup. no kidding. :)  they have a kit, $390
($790 if they install it). available in Brazilian Rosewood, Italian Walnut,
Santos Rosewood, Elm Burlwood, Italian Burlwood.

sorry. no kits for Splitties or Breadloafs or Eurovans (but EV folks might
check with them to see if any future plans have been made). :)
