Well ....

After that graphic of Martha, I've done some reflecting and soul searching 
:)

Realizing I've got a bit of money left over after school expenses, I should 
invest in the best possible ventures out there!.

Anyone know the stock exchange ticker symbol for the firm that makes 
flannel shirts?

Kodak will also be a high candidate since they make the camera that took 
the picture! ;)
