Subject:       Re: Speaking of Windshield Wipers...

&gt; 
&gt; I'm real dissappointed in the windshield wipers in both my 87 and 88
&gt; Vanagons.  They seem to smear, or chatter or both and just do a poor job in
&gt; general. 
&gt; I've swithced wipers by replacing the assembly sometimes and replacing just
&gt; the rubber insert at other times.  I've tried Anco, Trico (sp?) and right now
&gt; I've got fancy &quot;Tripledge&quot; wipers installed that have multiple ridges on each
&gt; wiper - supposed to be made of silicon for ultimate wiping.  They're just as
&gt; bad as the rest.  They do have a lifetime replacement warranty though.  Just
&gt; send in the wiper and about $8 for S+H and they'll send you a new $10 wiper!!
&gt; Some warranty!
&gt; 
Have you tried Bosch? I put a set on my Jetta - they seem to last 
quite well, and were $7 CDN each. I too went through the triple edge 
crap - they fall apart after 1-2 months of our rainy weather. On the 
Jetta, the Bosch have a much more OEM look also.
