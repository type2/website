&gt;&gt; This does not just affect syncros, but all later vanagons with 
&gt;&gt; digifant fuel injection. The VW recommended correction is a $100 
&gt;&gt; wiring harness. 
&gt;
&gt;I've also got some instructions for the $.50 version of this fix if 
&gt;anyone is interested (requires capacitor, soldering iron and 
&gt;heatshrink.)
&gt;
&gt;
Let's see.....$.50 or $100......this is NOT a real hard choice.  Let's hear 
the $.50 solution.
