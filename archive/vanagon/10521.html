Subject: Wacky Warning light

My 84 Vanagn GL has a problem. 

When starting the VW up, all the idiot lights go on then off, no problem.
After warming the vanagon up for a bit. I start driving. When i come to the 
first stop sign (about 1,500 yds), the water warning light starts flashing and 
the needle shoots off toward the right. I start driving again and the light
goes out, 
and the needle falls all the way (no recording of &quot;actual&quot; water temp.) When
I stop again 
at a light or something and then start off again the process repeats.

Today I just sat there for a while until the fan came on, about 15 minutes,
which
sounds about right. Then I drove off. This time no problem but the needle is
still
all the way to the left (no &quot;actual&quot; temperature).

Any ideas what and where I should be looking. Also which is the best manual
for the 84 Vanagon (GL)

Thanks!
