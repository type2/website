Subject: Fuel Pump Noise


Greetings All:
        There have been a number of questions regarding the noise that
electric fuel pumps tend to make.  This is normal, believe it or not.  It
does get louder with age and/or wear, but as long as you recieve the proper
output pressure fromt the pump, do not let it concern you.  My '84 GTi has
had this irritating whine for 'nigh onto three years.  They are to expensive
for me to consider replacing it, just for the sake of noise.  Hope this
helps shed some light,
