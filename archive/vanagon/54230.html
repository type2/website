&gt;| Instead he suggested that on my way out I take a
&gt;| look at his Range Panzer, a converted vanagon Syncro. I took a few
&gt;| pictures, which you'll find at
&gt;| http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/bus-stuff/MSch with a few comments. 

	I want a bush guard like that (well, one would be nice, one that was
more like the one on the Tristar photo that someone had on their web page
would be nice). Anyone know where Martin Schneider got his from that page?
