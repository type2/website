&gt; I am wanting to add a hitch to my 69 Bus.  I haven't figured out all of the

Richard,

Sorry, you cannot do this.  The U-Haul tandem trailers are too heavy to
pull with a bus, even empty, forget putting something on one.  I had a
recent experience moving Richard Palmer's (now my) '67 up to DC.  We used
a Toyota pickup and lied shamelessly (said it was a bug) in order to get
them to rent us one of their dollies.  The bus nearly ran the pickup off
the road every time we put on the brakes.  Check with U-Haul, there is a
strict towing vehicle/towed vehicle weight ratio, which I now am willing
to trust them on.  Basically they won't put one of their trailers behind
anything smaller than one of the ~20 foot trucks.  I think the weight
ratio is about 2:1 towing/towed.  If you want a class I hitch, I have one,
but the max is 1K lbs, and it is in VA.  I now believe that this is the
max for a bus, not just from a mounting point perspective, but from a
control perspective as well.
