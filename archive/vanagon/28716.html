&gt; Along these lines may I suggest humbly, that a US 50, and Rt 66 tour
&gt; in a circle would be neat.  My SO did a 2.5 week WV to Colorado and
&gt; back partially for a wedding, partially to see the country this spring
&gt; and had great fun on 50, it goes coast to coast after all, there are
&gt; books about it, and its mostly the best sort of Bus road, 2 lane
&gt; blacktop.  Of course she did it in a eeeeekk Legacy wagon and tent, but
&gt; she clearly has bad taste as she puts up with me.
