Subject: Re: VWs and we're off to Bolivia

Hi Glen, my experiences with VWs in South America is not a satisfactory
one. The most reliable country where you can find a good driveable westy
is Brazil and not all the Busses have enough supply of parts, specially
those from 73 and up. The easier bus to repair is pre-72 or 72 with an
upright engine. It's very difficult to find parts and good mechanics for
busses with fuel injection, and don't ever think about automatic trans-
mission. If I was you, I would buy a 1970 Westy,in mint conditions mecha-
mission. If I was you, I would buy a 1970 Westy,in mint conditions mecha-
nically and cosmetically, here in the States and ship it to Venezuela or
Brazil. Good luck and enjoy the beauty of a virgin country. Be careful in
the border between Venezuela and Brazil, where it is a little dangerous.
Saludos!
