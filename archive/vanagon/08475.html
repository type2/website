So William Abbott says:
&gt; 	All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bottom line, folks: Should I attempt to re-use a case, crank,
&gt; rods and heads from an engine that burned a piston after only a few
&gt; hours of running? Has anyone got experience CA smogging a dual-port big-bore
&gt; when a single-port 1600 was stock? Can anyone recomend a shop for
&gt; air-cooled machine work in the South Bay?

Smog is a non-issue for that old of a bus Bill.  Even if it was, a newer
engine would be acceptable.

I'd get a new case and not trust the burned one.
