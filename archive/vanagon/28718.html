&gt;&gt;I have a friend - a non-list member - who recently bought an '89 Vanagon 
&gt;&gt;that was equipped with alloy wheels.  As I recall from my Vanagon shopping 
&gt;&gt;days ('91 Westy) the alloy wheels, though gorgeous, had some pretty 
&gt;&gt;daunting care requirement/recommendations, such as weekly washing, 
&gt;&gt;avoiding certain detergents, etc, that were apparently related to 
&gt;&gt;corrosion problems.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, the corrosion &amp; maintenance problems are really, really bad.  Tell him
&gt;he should get rid of those alloys right away!  By the way, I, uh, uh, uh,
&gt;could be persuaded to take them off his hands (not that I'd want the
&gt;headaches of course) for a maybe uh, uh, $20. each or $50. if I was &quot;forced&quot;
&gt;to take the whole set.
&gt;
&gt;
Jim you are such a very thoughtful person to offer this. In light of the
fact that everyone would sorely miss you here I cannot let you be so selfless.

But because I live in a non corrosion sphere I will volunteer to take these
unwanted and unsafe corroding death hoops myself. That's CASH baby.
