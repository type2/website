Subject: Re: Bentley cost?

The last time I looked Bentleys were going for between $150,000 and $200,000
being the cheaper version of the Rolls-Royce.

Oh,,,,you mean Bentley manuals?  Forget the above:-)

The Bus Stop wants $84.95 for 1963 to 1967 and $34.95 for 1968 to 1979.

Parts Palce, Inc wants $84.95 for 1963 to 1967 (LOOKS LIKE PRICE FIXING TO
ME!!!) and $31.95 for 1968 to 1979.

Hope this helps!
