Subject: request for info/help in choosing a later model Vanagon

Hello,

    I am finally going to buy a Vanagon, and hopefully I won't get a lemon.  I
would like to buy as late of a model as I can find for less than $4000, and I
don't expect that I'll opt for the pop-top/Westfalia, unless someone here can
convince me that it is really worth the extra expense.

    Some questions I have...

    Are there certain years/models to look out for/be wary of (I've heard that
87 was a good year for Vanagons) ?

    What should I have checked out when I am taking a propective purchase to
the mechanic (I'm clueless about auto mechanics) ?

    What are typical problems that I should look for, and which ones are 
major ?

    Will I have to become a VW mechanic if I want to keep it on the road (as
I've been told more than once) ?


    Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice !


-James
