Umm, I was vague on purpose... couldn't remember. So I ran out to the
parking lot, boy the lengths I go to for this group :), and looked.

Tridon Aerofoil. I got them on the spur of the moment when I saw an
autoglass place advertising them for $6.99 each.

I hear that Bosch blades are good also, but have had no experience.
