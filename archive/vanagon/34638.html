Subject: Placement of list sticker

	I'll vote for bottom left corner, rear window, though on Little 
Martha there's already a very cool sticker there, so my actual sticker 
location will be similar but not exactly as specified. That seems logical, 
given context.

I also like Martha Rubin's suggesting of one in front- center top 
of windshield seems safe enough- area is blocked by the rear view mirror. 
But be careful- CA state vehicle code specifies lower-right corner ONLY 
for front-window  stickers, and yes, it is a safety issue. Maybe on the
Front Bumper is best for front stickers.

	Cheers!
	Bill
