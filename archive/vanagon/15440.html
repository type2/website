Subject: RE: Oil pressure

I bought and have been satisfied with whatever brand JC Whitney sells.  I've
used them on the stock Vanagon engine and on the Porsche six.  My take on
oil pressure and temperature gauges is that you're not looking for absolute
numbers but for relative numbers and change over time.
