Subject: VW Newbie needs advice!!!

I am an 18 year old from Long Island NY, who has for awhile wanted a vw
bus. I'd prefer a camper model as I plan to take it on the road for the
summer. I rerally know almost nothing and I'm looking for any advice
anyone can give me.

What is the cheapest vehicle I can get that will last me a summer of
touring?
Do you need to be a mechanic to drive a vw?
are major parts likely to break causing me to need parts during a trip?
What is the avg fuel economy of the vanagons?
how fast do they go? (safely)
What model would be best for camping in?
Is there a place where I can go to get these wuestions answered so I don't
have to burned you people??

any other advice or any info that can be given to me will be GREATLY
appreciated.

thanks in advance
Justin Fauci
