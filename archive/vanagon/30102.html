Subject: xmas present

I know this doesn't apply to type II's, my friend is one the other vw 
lists.  This friend has a 72 ghia without a owners manual, and it would 
make an excellent present for xmas.  does anyone have or know of one that 
is for sale.  I'd like it in decent cond and complete.  thanks for any help.
