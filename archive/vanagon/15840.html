&gt; Also, I have only been getting 16 miles per gallon in the city.  Again, does
&gt; anybody know what kind of mileage a 2.0 with fuel injection should get?
&gt; Highway or City?
&gt; 
&gt; 

This has been discussed thoroughly last fall. Here's my experience:

1980 Vanagon with Pop top, 2.0l F.I., Man. Trans., no extras

 -&gt; 15-17 mpg on short trips
 -&gt; up to 22 or 23 mpg on long highway runs (60-65 mph)
