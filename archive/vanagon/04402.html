&gt;&gt;       She is already opening comm channels with Bureau of Auto Repair.  Would
&gt;&gt; the Better Business Bureau be of an help?  Small claims?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!

My friend David had trouble with a shop doing work on his dodge. It had
previously been fixed under warranty. The same problem developed a week
later and he was told the first shop had done the job wrong and because it
had already been fixed it wasn't covered and it would take two weeks to
fix.
When he mentioned this to our friend Doug the lawyer, Doug mentioned a
consumer law and offered to call the shop. He called the next day,
explained he was Mr. Gow's lawyer and asked if they couldn't work something
out. David got the truck back the next day. They had fixed it, tuned it,
and changed the oil and lubed it. No legal action was ever taken.
So Thom, got a friend who's a lawyer?
A little polite intimidation goes a long way, be prepared to back it up though.

best of luck,
