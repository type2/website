&gt; While I won't defend the vandalization either, I wonder if you all would 
&gt; feel more comfortable if the black man in a caddy was replaced with a 
&gt; yuppie in a beemer or a bubba in a big ol 4x4? Would anyone rise to the 
&gt; defense of these much-maligned groups? 
&gt; 
&gt;   if it was a yuppie in a BMW he should have carved up BOTH sides
&gt;   of the offending vehicle...
&gt; 

If it were a bubba, he would have no idea what a VW is... By the way
what would a bubba be doing at the library.
