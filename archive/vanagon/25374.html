I am not sure that I originated the idea; but this and others have been
explored on the net (including water cooled heater boxes!). I agree with
Sami, the inline fan does ensure the defrosters work well at idle but
there is no increase in heat. $60 seems a bit steep.You maybe able to
locate
the equivalent at a marine shop where the JC model comes from anyway.
Bill Kennedy also has the fan set up with his Porsche/Vanagon.

There is one down side: the heat tube acts like a megaphone transmitting
the high pitch of the fan into the cabin. The closer to the defrosters the
higher the volume of the air but also the noise. I will be moving mine
from the front to the back once I get this BA6 aux gas heater hooked up... 

Good luck - DC
