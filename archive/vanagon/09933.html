So David Schwarze says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can't possibly believe for one instant that the Chargers are actually
&gt; &gt; going to beat the Steelers do you?  
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I believe it!  I have all my Steelers voodoo dolls lined up
&gt; and ready to go...

I don't think voodoo dolls or any other incantations are gonna help the
Chargers in this one.  I think even the 49er's (assuming they get past
Dallas) will have their work cut out for them with the Steelers as well.

&gt; &gt; BTW, please scan those pics before I go home!  :)  I can't see them on my
&gt; &gt; dumb terminal.  
&gt; 

Doh! is right.  Oh well, I'll just have to be patient. :|   
&gt; 
&gt; NTCA Mosaic?  What's that, Nauseating Thorougly Crappy Application?  I
&gt; suggest you acquire netscape, it's much beddah.

Well... I'm at the mercy of my systems people (and Intel).  Oh well....
