Subject: Violating the no-fun-allowed rule (was: 6 cylinders (phooey))


&gt;&gt;&quot;I hope people don't judge me based on one example of my behavior,&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The one example of Steve's behavior I find annoying is his CONTINUOUS
&gt;reference to 6, count them, VI, SIX, &lt;puts on little  girl's voice&gt; SEE --
&gt;ICKS, cylinders. I have always been attracted to the character and
&gt;personality of VW's not their cylinder endowment. More power to ya Stevo
&gt;(Pun intended), but don't think your little plan to encourage cylinder envy
&gt;has gone unnoticed.                  ^^^^^^^^^^^


It is NOT little. Hmph.



And V6anagon was easier to write than V_finally_a_car_with_the_utility_
room_handling_ease_of_maintainence_and_carrying_capacity_of_my_old_69_bus_
plus_the_ability_to_keep_up_with_traffic_without_being_a_pain_in_the_
patoot_to_the_people_behind_me_and_it_even_has_a_real_heater_anagon.

But you can refer to it that way it you want.   :^)



Gawd, I love Fridays!
