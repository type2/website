&gt;I guess this is sort of a &quot;See you too can do this&quot; message.  If you also
&gt;responded as a person for them to see write back!  They are loads of fun
&gt;and a welcome addition to your lives!



Any chance they're heading down San Diego way? They're welcome to
stop in, or meet at a restaurant/show/VW junkyard or whatever!
