&gt;Does anyone know of a way to get at the antenna of an '88 GL without
&gt;completely dismantling the dash?  I need to replace the antenna (snapped it
&gt;off in a car wash, DUH!), but it looks like I'll have to take the whole #$%_at_&amp;
&gt;dash out to do it.  Any shortcuts?

you do NOT have to remove the dash, just the headlights on the drivers side.
there is a HOW TO procedure out on the gopher files. if somebody wants it
and can't FTP or GOPHER to it, let me know and i'll send it to you.
