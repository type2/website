Subject: '79 Bus. . .grounded again (sigh)

Hope I don't look silly replying to my own post. . .it's the simplest way
for me to update y'all on the continuing saga of &quot;Scarecrow&quot; (so named
because 1. It needed a &quot;brain&quot; for a long time and 2. It's spent most of
it's time sitting in fields immobile.)

&gt;Well, I feel better now.  It's runs pretty decent, actually (I've only had
&gt;it a few hours, and just went home with it and spent an hour crawling all
&gt;around inside with Windex and towels spiffing everything up -- hasn't &gt;
been washed in a year I bet.)  The garage wants me to come back after 500
&gt;miles or so to flush (?) the fuel tank, some gunk in it I guess

&quot;Gunk&quot; which, while on the freeway at 60mph, created a bluish smoke from the
exhaust. Is it just cleaning itself out, or is the carb maladjusted? I.e.,
burning too rich? (if it was oil it'd be black, not blue.)  Should I be
slightly perturbed since I just spent $1313.16 (on credit) to fix it? I
would expect the mechanic would make sure this sucker will pass emissions or
at least warn me.

Anyway I'm grounded again. . .the blue smoke attracted a smokey on the
freeway who, upon doing a computer check of my (previous owner's) California
plate, discovered it to have expired a year ago.  So I was cited for
&quot;fictitious plate&quot; and a couple of other things.  The cops took the plate
off and forbade me to drive the thing until I got the problem squared away.
Oh well.

&gt;I may have messed up the emergency brake -- drove it for a while and
&gt;forgot to release it.  Then again, if it was working properly it should
have &gt;killed the engine in 1st gear, yes?  It still seems to work though.

It still seems to work. . .maybe when I'm back for the 500-mile check I'll
have 'em adjust the brakes again (rear.)  I always use the 1st gear as a
back-up brake anyway, since Phoenix is mostly flat. (I'm sure someone will
reply with reasons why the 1st gear alone is _not_ a reliable emergency
brake!  But heck, this ain't San Fran.)

More exciting stuff later, I'm sure. . .
