&gt; Is anybody going to the BUG OUT over Memorial Day weekend. I will be there

&gt; I will be camping at the Bull Run Regional park. Maybe we can have an East
&gt; Coast V_at_L cookout.
&gt; Is there any interest?  

YES!  Problem is I'll be off-line for some nine or ten days.  I'll get 
private email after I get back but I'll be unsubscribing for the 9 days.  
Could you imagine how unhappy my ISP would be with that much mail 
gathering in the inbox?


By the way I live some four or five miles from the Bug Out site.  Too bad 
I'll be gone or I could help work out stuff as the local boy...
