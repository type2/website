Subject: Re: Speedo light replacement

Ok, the bulb behind the speedometer in the dash of my '75Westy
has quit.  When I get a few spare hours, I'd like to replace it.
It looks like a major job, pulling the instrument panel and opening it
just to get at the bulb.  Two questions:
1.  what are the specs for the bulb, and can I replace it with
a common bulb found at Canadian Tire or any auto supply store, or must I
go to the dealer?
2. Does anyone have any painless procedure for getting to the bulb?
