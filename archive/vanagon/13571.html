So Bradley says:
&gt; split window buses there.
&gt; 
&gt; And speaking of the Red Rock (lobster)... I, as well as Martha and perhaps 
&gt; Sam (sglw_at_aol_dot_com), might be driving down on Thursday evening from the 
&gt; Bay Area.   Personally, I'd like a place to sleep that wasn't a rest 
&gt; stop.  So, anyone want to offer a driveway or a curb late that night?

Someone mentioned earliar that they'd like to meet in the Bakersfield
area.  Maybe a, ahem, KOA?  Just an area with no hook-ups but use of
the facilities.  I'd like to meet up with any folks that would like
to meet there Thursday night.
