John,

Do you really want to change to an aircooled engine? You will
get a lousy heater! And a Vanagon aircooled will be a step
backwards.

If you want to get more power, try converting to a AUDI 5 Cyl.
or, if you like to have a 6 Cyl., Oettinger offers a watercooled
engine with only 140PS. I heard about an conversion to the Volkswagen
VR6 but not of a kit for this.

My 91 Vanagon Carat 2.1 Seized up....
We are thinking about a conversion to a Porsche 6 cyl or and Aircooled
Bus engine.  What sort of conversions make sense and have been done...
are there any &quot;kits&quot; for this.

Thanks in advanced.
John
