Subject: expensive sounding noise

Well, tonight I've got two new problems on the 88GL.  Coolant leak out of the 
broken coolant level sensor probably due to a mechanic over torquing it while 
nickel and diming me instead of fixing the still leaking head gasket.  Guess 
I'll try super glue or maybe a #6.5 beer carboy stopper to get the van back to 
the shop for the 4th time. BTW, sorry for the rant.  I digress.  

Anyway, I also have an expensive sound coming from near the tranie or the 
anterior of the engine compartment when I push the clutch to the floor.  It 
sounds like metal scraping.  Is this the clutch plate gone bad and scaping 
metal on metal like a worn brake shoe on a drum?  Anyone had a similar symptom 
diagnosed and fixed?

Thanks in advance for patience and advice.
Karl
