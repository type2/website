Subject: HELP!  My 88 Vanagon has a problem.

I'm having a big problem with my 88 Vanagon.  Back in February, while 
driving along, the van revved up really high and stuck there.  I took it in 
for repair and they ended up replacing computer parts to the tune of about 
$600.00.  Now it's doing it again.  I took it back to the place I had it 
first, and they couldn't find anything wrong.  It's working fine for me now 
too.

What happened was that I was idling while waiting at a McDonald's drive 
through lane, and all of a sudden the van started revving up really high.  
I turned the whole thing off, and removed the key from the ignition.  It 
was still going!  The only way I could get it stopped was to start it up 
again, at which point it went back to normal.

I feel like I'm driving a time bomb.  Any suggestions or comments, other 
than that I got screwed out of $600?
