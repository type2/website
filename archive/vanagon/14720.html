Subject: Multivan Question

Does anybody know the book value for a 1991 Multivan.  The books I looked in 
have 
no listings for Multivans.  When I checked elswhere on the net where the 
Vins were 
explained the was no &quot;T&quot; for Multivan.  Does anybody know the value of a 
Multivan vs Camper
vs Vanagon?
