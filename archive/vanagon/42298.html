All,

  I thought all problems with my '62 bus were over! but sadly today i decided
to drive it to work (i work about 50 miles from home). This would be the
ultimate test of my overhaul work. Got on to the motorway (about 5 miles from
home) and the generator light came on, i did'nt think the battery would get
me all the way so i took the next junction off and left it round my aunty
house. As i came to a stop and the revs went down the light flickered off.
and when it was idling it did not come on.
Any suggestions?

Cheers,
'62 Camper
