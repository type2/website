Subject: Windshield wiper update for Vanagons

Hi Volks,
   I have a bit of news for Vanagon owners looking for a wiper that clean
more surface area.   The 1995 and newer GMC/Chevy S Series trucks use a
mounting design that is the same as VW's.  The new design blades are 20
inches long.  The mounting bracket is located such that when measured its 9
inches to the top and 11 inches to the bottom or left to right as the case
may be.  Make sense?  Anyway, when installed on a Vanagon the wiper cleans
2 inches more at the bottom of the windshield and the top area remains the
same. I installed a set on my Vanagon and the extra cleaning area make a
big difference.  The part number is:  15731162.  or ask for a right wiper
blade for a '96 S-truck.  Any questions, just write me. Take care.
