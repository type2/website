When I was a decade younger :-( the gas tank was drained off of my '73
type II three times in two weeks -- just happened to coincide with a bunch
of motorcycle-thugs roaimng around town -- they were later arrested for
allegedly stealing gas from cars all over State College, PA....

I wish I had thought of Thom Fitzpatrick's neat little trick then!!!
