Well I got that 69 camper going. Thought for a while it would kill me. Left me
to tired to tell ya about it as it went along, like when I had to haul the 71
bus away with the 68--wasn't that fun, especially each time I had to crawl up
under a bus in the middle of traffic. The real kicker was I got that window on
myself Joel, it look great but today I noticed water leaking at the bottom
inside so I gave a couple wacks in case it would help the seal set and sure
enough, busted the windshield. This thing has consumed me but now I leave it
behind with my wife for a couple of month while studying at Oxford and have to
sign off tell then. Still have a 68 bus to sell with a great engine, and yes
Barry it also has rust, its these Louisville winters.
