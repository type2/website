John  &amp; All -

Since you asked . . . . . . .
This was on my '64 Deluxe. I fabbed a high rack from Quik N Easy
clamps and 2x4's.  I added a vertical support with another 2x4.
covered kayak contact surfaces with carpet.  I was able to carry 6
boats up there.  With about 90 degrees of steering play, it was a
challenge to drive!  Scared the daylights out of the passengers.

The owner of Yakima racks is also a kayaker, so is familiar with the
needs of kayakers.  Check out their equipment.

However, with the takeover of the plastic tupperware boats and the
decline of fiberglass, most racks don't cater to the more delicate
fiberglass, which yours probably is (sounds like an ocean boat).

Check with shops that specialize in ocean cruisers.

As for driving, assure that you have the proper reinforced sidewall
tires, and be cautious.  It cannot be as bad as my '64 was.

Check the archives on bike racks.  The same principles apply in
regards to &quot;on the top&quot; versus &quot;over the top&quot;.

- Jeff  '80 Westi
My kayak fits INSIDE a Vanagon, and it's the
fiberglass one I bought way back in 1980

I would appreciate hearing from anyone that has had some
experience with setting up a roof rack for a large kayak and
then traveling on the road with it.  I imagine that it
can be pretty exciting in a high wind.
