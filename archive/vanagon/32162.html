Fellow Vanamaniacs,

If anyone tried to e-mail me or the list about the Alternator could you send
to me again?  AOL struck again and all the mail that I downloaded this
evening locked up and cannot be read.  But I did find bearings at Burnsville
VW.  They're a special order and about $35 but a lot cheaper than a new
alternator.

Well, out for now.

Brad
