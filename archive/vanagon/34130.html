Subject: Timming belt

Hi,
  Just read your post about the 86 Vanagon.  I just wanted to tell you that
Your bus doesn't have a timing belt. Well, actually if it's a diesel then
it would.  But I'm assuming that its a horizonally  opposed 4 cylinder
1.9L.  That engine is amazingly similiar to a beetle engine.  The cam runs
directly off of the crank.  So no belt needed.  As far as the muffler goes,
the last time I checked VW did not offer a warrenty on their Vanagon and
air-cooled mufflers. But that might have changed. If you bought your muffer
from a auto-parts store it might be warrentied.  I know that brands like
A-P and Walker offer lifetime warrenties and their VW mufflers. Hope this
helps.  Take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
