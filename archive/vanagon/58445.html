Chris,
Read this forwarded E-mail.  Unfortunately not very encouraging.

Hi Ron,

I'm afraid that my contacts at VAG and at VWoA Product Planning were not very
confident about the EuroVan being relaunched here. After two postponements
already, this time it was worded &quot;postponed until further notice&quot;.

If you have not already done so, I suggest you write to VWoAs Clive Warrilow
directly and express your concerns/desires. Perhaps a suggestion in the
EuroVan (and other) forum(s) to have your fellow enthusiasts do the same is
an idea. Don't bother with any correspondence to Volkswagen AG. They only
forward this kind of mail to VWoA anyway. 

Sorry for the bad news.

Regards
Juergen
