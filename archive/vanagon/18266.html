Subject: Re: VW-1600 DUAL PORT-MANIFOLD BOOT LEAKS(f)

On Wed, 24 May 1995, Nick Pace and Chris were comiserating:
&gt;
1.pulled the engine out of Bus sitting along side Interstate 5 somewhere... 
2. gas sprayed in my face when
3. watching one of the engine studs snap off on a Sunday morning and knowing
that the nearest parts shop won't be open
4. trying to change the oil cooler gaskets with the engine still in the Bus
5. secretly love to work on my Bus especially like the part where it's 30
degrees, and the metal feels like  -0.  The flash light is getting dimmer,
but you have to get the engine into the bus by daylight or you won't be
going home for Christmas this year, but then you got the wrong oil pump in
there, and Christmas ends 12 miles later anyway... 
6.stripped nutted, German-Brazilian-Mexican machinery.  Think of me when all
of you are at the beach having a good time.

Rusty adds:
1. snapping a (doghouse) oilcooler retention bolt on Sunday night 10PM
following a &quot;you never give me any attention&quot; conversation with the SO.
Snapped bolt due to over torqueing because the engine builder used a step
stud (10mm down to 8mm) instead of tapping the case for 10mm. Need the bus
for work at the new job 8AM Monday.
2.Accidently poking the old tranny output seal INTO the split case tranny of
the &quot;never  been ****ed (messed) up&quot; '57 oval beetle. Occurence on late
Saturday afternoon of a major 110 degree July holiday weekend. Everyone else
is swimming and getting drunk. The wife decides to start a discussion on
&quot;you never give me any attention.&quot; Need vehicle for SO to drive on Tuesday 8 AM.
3. Lunching the motor of the &quot;never been nosed&quot; '62 Ghia coupe that you just
bought. Getting a tow through Phoenix via 12' tow strap from someone that
you barely know. The wife rides with the tow guy &quot;for safety.&quot; Tow guy
starts HAULING through traffic, pushing yellow lights and you realize that
the brakes in the Ghia as well as the horn don't work for beans. Tow guy and
wife are in a pretty friendly chat (a discussion on &quot;Why you never give her
any attention&quot;) while you frantically try to slow the guy down with the
lousy brakes, honk the broken horn, avoid the bumper of the tow guys full
sized GMC truck and get his attention all at the same time. (about as much
fun as a Gene Berg road ralley through Compton or Oakland on a paycheck
Saturday night!)

I think we're all nuts. Don't you love it?
