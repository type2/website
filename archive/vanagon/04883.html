&gt; &gt; Okay, everyone, I think we should have our own &quot;Five Year Dream Car Pick.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Same rules, which for your convenience I reproduce here:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ..each was asked to pick the car, any car,
&gt; &gt; he wished. BUT! there's some gotchas!  (I think joel meant &quot;catches&quot;, but
&gt; &gt; I think maybe &quot;gotchas&quot; and &quot;catches&quot; are pronounced identically in
&gt; &gt; Alabamese.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; '84 Vanagon
&gt; 
&gt; 	I hate to admit it but I would get one of those Humvee (sp),
&gt; 	jeep on steroids thing. Rig some sort of camper add-on, or
&gt; 	maybe a pop-top, yeh thats it a hummer with a pop top!
&gt; 	The attraction is a car that can go more places, tow things, and
&gt; 	looks better when scratched.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Alistair &quot;ahll be bach&quot; Bell
&gt; 

i second the humvee (however it's spelled). i rather like the eurovan, 
but the humvee would be my choice one.

not only that it would look like me, too. wide, wide, and ugly enough to 
be cute. (yes wide twice)
