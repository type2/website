Subject: Re: Center Console

&gt;I must admit that I thought of building a short center console for tool
&gt;storage, but I'm sure not married to the idea. I too really appreciate the
&gt;walk-through feature...and I have many more important things to do to the
&gt;bus before I spend time weighing the pros and cons of a center console. I
&gt;also thought of mounting my spare tire up front and using the tire well for
&gt;tool storage...too much cabinet space is being eaten up by spare parts and
&gt;tools.

How do you mount the spare tire on the front?  I've seen some busses
like this and have wanted to mount it in the front to make room for tool
storage in back as well.  Also, the bus has looked sad ever since some jerk
stole
the VW symbol off of the front.  Spare tire on the front would make it
happy again!  Can anybody help?
