Subject: RE: VW camper interest

Darien and all list members - Anyone looking to buy a Vanagon or any vehicle 
needs to check at WWW.TraderOnline_dot_com. This is the online version of the Auto 
Trader magazines. I checked last week and there were 30 syncros and/or westies 
for sale across the US.

FL. Travelling through the US.
