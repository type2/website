Subject: Re[2]: syncro with snorkel ? Yes/No?

     Don't all vanagons have snorkels?
     
     My '87 just got back from the body shop and was missing the snorkel.  
     They repaired this portion of the van, but did not replace the old 
     one.  This thing is the air duct that connects to the air filter 
     assembly to get fresh air from the air scoop at eye level.  All of us 
     should have it, I believe.

As far as I know, I've been informed that the Syncro comes with a snorkel 
built in the right side air scoop cavity.....  supposedly up to &quot;eye level&quot;.
 (What is eye level anyway?)
     
Am I wrong?
