&gt; Well, I hope that after this problem is solved, most of the problems will go
&gt; away for a while.  I like my 82 diesel, though!  The oil definate does come 

I like my '82 diesel too! (when it is runnning well...).

I read earlier somebody having the &quot;oil-cap not tight&quot; problem.
With my old blow-by laden engine, leaving the oil cap loose meant a day
of cleaning the back of NuBus.  With my newer engine, I can
leave the cap loose all day and not have a bit of oil leak out. YMMV.

Today, NuBus is at the shop because of lousy horsepower. She idles
and rev's fine, but can't maintain 55 on the highway. My mechanic
is starting to feel sorry for me. He didn't charge for the last work he did.

We drove to NYC for thanksgiving. I had to drive the Plymouth Acclaim.
The kids hated having to share a seat. They whined and fought the
whole way.
