Hi Rik,

 You should read the archives, there is an excellent description of how
to drop the tank without a big hassle. One of the instructions that
helped me on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, etc. times that I dropped the tank
was that the plastic elbow connectors that are on the top must be popped
out by hand . There are 3 or 4 of them to yank before you can drop the
tank. The rubber seals usually pop out with them and once you have fully
removed the tank you simply clean the seals(or replace them, they're not
that expensive) and put them back in the holes on the top of the tank
before reinstalling. When the tank is back in, the plastic tubes just
pop back into the seals. You have to lube them up real good first, I
used silicon grease because it protect the rubber as well. 
 The sender can be disconnected when you have the tank half way out and
the breather tubes as well. The whole removal and reinstallation process
can be accomplished with only one set of hands and didn't take me more
than an hour or so. 
 
 I should probably add that the first time that I removed the tank, it
was to attend to those rubber seals on top because when they get old
they can leak when you fill it up all the way. I was having that problem
and my overfill tubes were leaking too. 

 If you can't find that archive, just let me know, I'll dig it up.
