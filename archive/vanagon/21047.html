&gt; Hello everyone. My friend with a '68 was interested in installing a short-
&gt; block V-8. Does anyone know what is involved, whether or not kits are   
&gt; available, or anyone else who has done anything similar?
&gt; 
&gt; As I don't subscribe to the list I'd greatly appreciate e-mailed
&gt; replys; if there is enough response I'll post a summary to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!

     Why  you  wana  swap  engine?
 If  you  wana  do  it  you  can  find  kit  for  it,  but  you  may  expend
 $2,000  dollars  minimun. Also  alot  of  work  and  modifications,
 probably  you  may  hve  to  cut  the  body  a  bit.  I  have  photos  
 wich  have  been  done  in  a  bug. If  you  want  more  Info...  
 send  me  a  personal  E  MAIL.
