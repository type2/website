&gt;My boyfriend and I are planning a cross country trip in December.
&gt;We live in Vermont and will head south to Key West up through Louisiana, 
&gt;Texas, The Grand Canyon, over to Los Angeles, San Francisco and up to 
&gt;Vancouver. We don't have any time table so we can take our time.
&gt;
&gt;I'm assuming that a lot of the readers of this net have done long trips 
&gt;in their buses and can offer some sound advise as to what to take along.
&gt;as far as provisions, tools, clothes, food, pots &amp; pans dishes etc.
&gt;
Your Bus *WILL* break down somewhere, sometime. So bring your tools along,
maybe some spare parts (like points, plugs, belts, wires, duct tape, etc.
I think there is a list in Muir's Idiot book). Get AAA Plus, so that you
can be towed to the next VW dealer (which may be 2-300 miles away) and not
some local garage which knows NOTHING about air-cooled boxer engines. I
also recommend a good CB radio to call for help when stranded in the
middle of Nevada's highway 50 (The Loniest Road in America). I also have a
cellular phone for that purpose, although large areas of parsely populated
regions in the West are not covered yet.

Bon voyage!

Sami
