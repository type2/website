Subject: Pwr Brake Vac Hose (was RE: Idle Probs)


&gt;Mine did that, among other things. I found a hole in the little one-way
&gt;valve in the vacuum line that runs fron the intake naifold, all the way
&gt;forward to the poer brake servo. Replaced the valve (aftermarket--
&gt;VW doesn't make  them any more, but you might find NOS if you try),

I bought a replacement check valve from the dealer a few weeks ago (~$9).
Parts manager said it's the same check valve that is used on the 93 golf(?).
I've heard of aftermarket valves being used with no problems, too.

&gt;and still have a few problems. Tomorrow I will replace the hoses that go
&gt;to the line-- several people tell me that these are common trouble spots
&gt;in '71s.
&gt;
&gt;I've also heard, that ordinary heater hose works-- I don't have to use
&gt;the hugely expensive ribbed vacuum hose, so the story goes. I will get
&gt;the 1/2&quot; heater hose, and give it a try. It IS pretty stout looking.

I tried experimenting with various hoses and solicited the group for
opinions while I was resurrecting my power brakes last month.  I would NOT
use regular heater hose since there is a chance it might collapse and
surprise you one day while braking.  I am using Wire Reinforced 1/2&quot; heater
hose (made by Gates--a.k.a. shape to fit hose).  It's as tough as the VW
vacuum hose but much cheaper.  

It's a good idea to get a new rubber grommet on the firewall where the
vacuum hose passes through if yours is missing/dried out.  The metal edge on
the hole in the firewall could saw through your hose with all the engine
vibration.
