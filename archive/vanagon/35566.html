&gt;What really pleases my wife about the safety of our Vanagon is that because
&gt;it has almost no get-up-and-go, I HAVE to drive defensively.  I used to be a
&gt;real jerk when I had my Jeep Grand  Wagoneer and didn't mind terrorizing
&gt;folks.  (...back in my immature days).

One time I flew on a military charter 747 and there was a single seat 
 that was at the very front  of the aircraft, you could turn around and 
 look back at the whole plane. It felt like I was on the tip of a 
 spear, the feeling was so powerful that no one would sit in it for 
 longer than a few minutes. I sometimes get that same feeling driving 
 my Bus, I have often told my friends that if everybody drove vw vans 
 that the world would be a safer place to drive. I have found I drive 
 the bus like I ride my motorcycle, pretend that you are invisible and 
 everyone is out to get you.

Drive safe,
Clay  ( still in my immature days) Perry
