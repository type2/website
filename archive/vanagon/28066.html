Subject: Help Me Before I Spend a Fortune!

Went out to our local camper specialists today
(OWASCO VW in Whitby Ontario Canada)to look at the
Winnebago-modified Eurovan.  Our 1988 Westy, at
175,000 km is showing all the classic Vanagon
problems - exhaust, shocks, head gaskets, tranny
etc.  

We had just about resolved to keep fixing the 1988.
Having examined the Eurovan camper and been severely
underwhelmed by the loss of interior space compared to 
our Westy, we thought that we would bite the bullet,
and work to keep ours on the road indefinitely.

Unfortunately, we reviewed the VW Web Site the other
day, and were hooked by the photos of the Winnebago
modified long-wheelbase camper.

OWASCO was staging a camper day today, complete with
bratwurst and oom-pa-pa, so we trekked out to see the
new beast.  It's great!

So, before I pony up Cdn $45,000 (which I don't have),
can V_at_L members advise me?  Is the 5-cylinder reliable?
Is the front-engine design sorted out yet?  Is the
4-speed automatic any good?  Is the paint better?
Should I see my bank manager?

Comments please.
