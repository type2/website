&gt; Relatedly, does it seem to anyone else that East Coast speeds are rising, on
&gt; average.  We went up to Saratoga and back this weekend, and the speed du jour
&gt; seemed to be 78 or so.

Well, the 7 states that still have a maximum speed limit of 55 are all
still on the East Coast.

Pennsylvania
New Jersey
New York
Delaware
Maryland
Connecticut?
Rhode Island?

(My memory is failing on this, but I can attest to PA, NY, NJ, DE, and MD)

However, us folks on the East Coast still drive like a bat out of Hell. :)
