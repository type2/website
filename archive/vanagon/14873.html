Subject: Hi to all!

Hi, I've just joined the list, so greetings to everyone from sunny 
Helsinki (ha! ha!). I've a '64 panel van which I use all year round, and 
sorry to say have no indoor parking. But true to the great VW spirit he 
always starts first time, no matter how cold it is! Getting the doors 
open (due to the ice, you know that stuff, those of you in 
California??)is another matter...

A couple of questions: anyone know a good and cheap(ish) source for 
window rubbers(I need the rear loading door one) that would send to me by 
mail? Secondly, what is the most economical and reliable way to get more 
cruising speed from the van? I have a 1600 engine, totally stock. 
Reliability is more important to me than getting the most speed, but the 
roads here are long and srtaight....90km/h gets a bit boring. Any 
suggestions welcome.

Andy
