Subject: door-lock problem

	Hi,
	So I've got one new, Brazilian, door-handle with lock
installed on the passenger side. When I lock it, from inside
or outside, it locks fine. However, I can't open it with
the key from the outside!
	If I open and close the inside lock-lever, it
makes a pop-ping sound and they the key works form outside.

	Anyone recognize this symptom?

	Bill
