Subject: Who wanted How To Keep Your Rabbit Alive book?

A while back someone asked if I had or could find a copy of &quot;Poor Richard's 
Rabbit Book: How to Keep Your VW Alive.&quot;  Just found a used one at a used 
book store (don't need it, as I already have a copy.) But I seem to have 
inadvertantly deleted the original message.  If you're out there, please 
e-mail me.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
