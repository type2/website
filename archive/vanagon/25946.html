Subject:      Converting from 6 to 12 volts

Greetings to the list, here's a question for y'all:
 Does anyone know of a good, thorough description (or can
fake one:) of converting an old '66 6-volt system to
12 volts? I've been wanting to do this as parts and bulbs are
getting more difficult to find. Any advice or words of
wisdom? I realize the purists among us will have their
panties wadded up- admonishments will be read and duly
noted. :*)

Thanks,
Lisa Demmy
