&gt;&gt; Here in San Diego, CA, gasoline has jumped up to $1.50 per gallon
&gt;&gt; (that's about 40 cents per litre).  This is an increase of over 20%
&gt;&gt; in the last month.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; HAve other parts of the USA had such a large increase?

Gas prices in Burnsville, MN for the last 10 tanks (all are Super America 92
octane except 11 Apr which is Amoco):

22 FEB 96  $1.319
29 FEB 96  $1.339
5 MAR 96   $1.339
10 MAR 96  $1.319
17 MAR 96  $1.339
24 MAR 96  $1.379
29 MAR 96  $1.399
3 APR 96    $1.439
11 APR 96  $1.399
16 APR 96  $1.459

This is about an 11% increase in less than 2 months.
