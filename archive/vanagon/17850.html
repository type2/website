Subject: Re: syncro diff lock

&gt;How do I get the diff vacum servo out? I have undone the two screws, 
&gt;but then I cannot get them out. They are too long and get stuck on
&gt; the drive shaft. Do I have to take that out too? How do I test the 
&gt;diff lock? What is the best way to get all the wheels off the ground 
&gt;so I can test the diff? I hope to get to know my SYNCRO a bit better 
&gt;so I dont have to ask too many questions, but first I have to find
&gt; a manual here in the &quot;lucky country&quot;.

If you are going to do this kind of stuff you really need the manual.
Anyway, in order to get the diff lock out yu have to drive out a tiny roll
pin. The manual shows this.

I had thought Tim would respond to this before now but I'll respond since he
hasn't.

What is the &quot;lucky country?&quot;
