Idle Stablizer Rebuild?
I've enjoyed reading the list over the past few days and thought it was finally
time to consult the 'Pro's'...

Has anyone had any luck rebuilding/lubricating an intermittently stuck Idle
Control Valve Stablizer Unit?  I'm talking about the cylindrical doohickey that
sits on top of the intake manifold and vibrates it's little heart out.  Mine
seems to get stuck (the valve, not my heart, thank goodness) every once in a
while.  Usually in the morning.  I live in San Francisco so it's not like it's
feezing up due to outside temperature.

My current favorite remedy is to pull the hose to the air intake and 'install' a
small screwdriver into the unit to loosten a stuck something (is there a piston
in there?).  Works every time, but a drag if you have stuff loaded in the rear
cargo area and/or bikes on the back...

Suggestions?

Thanks,

P.S.  What's the consensus on flaming particular VW dealers who give BAD
advice/service?
