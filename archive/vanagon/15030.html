I have seen an article regarding align boring (sp?) might not do any real
good to VW air cooled engines. The author said so based on his statistic
data that such machining did not result mostly in satisfactory results.
The resaon, the author concluded, was that unless the machine shop had the
precise equipment and skill to do a critical precision job, such machining
were mostly wasted. Buying a new block is a better choice. I would replace
all bearings without doing an align boring.

Was this article posted on the list before?
