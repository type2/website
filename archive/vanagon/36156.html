&gt; All Air cooled Vanagons came with the 2.0 liter engine.

That's right, maybe nice to add that if you were in a country
where VW put a 'Transporter' Badge on the rear hatch you could
order it with a flat 1600 with hydraulic lifters and oilfilter,
carbureted, 37 kW/50 DIN Hp, enginecode CT, these were available
from 5-'79 to 12-'82. Because VW used it only 2.5 years some
people think it's a bad engine, i think it had more to do with
the introduction of the wasserboxer...
