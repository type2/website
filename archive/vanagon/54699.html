Subject: David is now on the web...

All,

I have finally gone public (so to speak). I have my web page started and
I need links. I certainly can find most of them, but your help will aid
my web page. If you have a web page, and would like it linked from my
web page, send me the URL. Also if someone has a desire to add a link to
my page, go right ahead. The URL is:

http://www.students.stedwards_dot_edu/~dgoldbe2

Note: This server is administered by students(I think) therefore the
page may not be accessible all the time, if so try again the next day.
Sorry, I cannot help this.

The best defense is a strong offense...
I intend to start offending.
