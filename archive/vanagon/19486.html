While I won't defend the vandalization either, I wonder if you all would 
feel more comfortable if the black man in a caddy was replaced with a 
yuppie in a beemer or a bubba in a big ol 4x4? Would anyone rise to the 
defense of these much-maligned groups? 

  if it was a yuppie in a BMW he should have carved up BOTH sides
  of the offending vehicle...
