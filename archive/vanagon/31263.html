Subject: re: RE: Cruise control for '80-82 Vanagon


Hi folks,

A couple other folks asked me about the ARA unit I have for my '85 that 
has an electric servo. Unfortunately ARA went out of business a couple 
years after I bought mine.

This topic got me interested in who else sells electric servo cruise 
control. Well Isspro, here in Portland Oregon sells Dana-Rostra(sp?). 
Isspro's phone number is 503-239-0754. The following parts are available:

Control Box/Servo 	250-1199	$162.20
Control Stalk		250-3084	$19.55
Wire Harnes		250-4166	$15.47

As a comparison I paid about $125 for my ARA but I made my own control 
stalk (actually pushbuttons on the dash) and it was purchased about six 
years ago.
