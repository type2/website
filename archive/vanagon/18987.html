&gt;I've got to share em with someone (you unfortunately for you all)
&gt;thanks to the help I have now added &quot;maker of precision displacement
transducers&quot; to my &gt;abilities, in fact if anyone ever needs a bargain
basement $20 displacement
&gt;transducer, (reuseable extensometer type, rivaling $200-$2000 commercial
models), hopefully &gt;fatigue rated, (crossing my fingers), with a precision
of somewhere between .00001&quot; and .0001&quot; &gt;give me a call, in fact give me a
job and I'll make em for you.  Anyway thanks again everyone, &gt;this might
finally put me near the end of a too long MSME.
