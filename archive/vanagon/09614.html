Subject: diesel vanagon part search

       Someone out there may know a parts source for me: a dismantler
       in Canada, UK or Europe, maybe.  I need a tubular steel type
       oil pump pickup pipe as was fitted to later model diesel or
       turbodiesel transporters (the vanagon bodied type).  The part
       was not used on the '82 and '83 diesel Vanagons imported to the
       US.  The US ones have a cast aluminum oil pump pick up pipe
       that is integral with the oil pump cover.

       Unfortunately, when my old engine lost a rod bearing, the
       pieces were sucked up and they destroyed the face of my
       old-type oil pump cover/pick up pipe.  My new engine is a later
       type diesel that has the new oil pump but the oil pickup tube
       is for the Rabbit/Golf application, not the Vanagon.  The
       Vanagon type is longer and with a different bend.  My local VW
       dealer parts man can special order a new oil pump and pickup
       pipe complete, but it would be very, very expensive.  I think
       the price quoted was $270.  Similar new oil pumps with pickup
       pipes are $95 for diesel rabbits/golfs.  

       Help!  Can someone refer me to possible sources of a good used
       part?  Your help would be greatly appreciated.

       Thanks in advance.
