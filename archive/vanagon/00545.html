Subject: 2500c type IV engines

I remember hearing people dreaming of 2500 bus engines.  And I just saw 
an ad in VW Trends for 2.5-3.1 liter kits for the type 4 engines.  It 
consists of crank, rods, and piston assemblies.  103 &amp; 105 mm.
The company is European Racing.

Is that what all you late bus people were looking for?
