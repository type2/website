	Lori died about 3 weeks before our 15th anniversary, which would
have been Thanksgiving, 1991. My friend Richard and I took the Thanksgiving 
week off and went to Joshua Tree National Monument. Somewhat cold at night,
but stunningly beautiful, and it was easy to find a place to park my 
Golf and pitch the tent. I recommend it, particularly the southern
extreme. The trail to Lost Palms oasis is incredible.
