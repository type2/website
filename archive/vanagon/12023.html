Subject:       fessin' up 

Okay, so I was wrong.  The extra ordinary mileage reported earlier 
was a tank filling problem...  Averaging all figures for some 400 miles 
logged in the last 2 days I get an even-steven 38 mpg, not bad but no 
51 mpg.  Excuse me while I go crawl in a hole.  For those new to the 
thread this had little to do with vans except for an ECU temp sender, 
the mileage is for my Camry.
