Subject: Re: Ooh, Ooh, manual!


Okay, I've lurked a bit and gleaned a lot off the list, now its my 
turn to contribute.

I have the owners manual for the 70 bus and an owners manual (not the 
parts manual) for either a '69 or '70 Westphalia (I forget which).  

Anyone who wants a copy of either manual, just email me with your snail 
mail address. After a week, I'll head to Kinko's and make copies and send 
them out.

Another option, which will take lots more time, is to put up a WWW page, 
with text and possibly pictures of the manuals. I'll start on that this 
weekend, but I can't make any guarantees about when they'll get done or 
where they'll appear.
