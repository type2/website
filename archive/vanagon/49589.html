Subject: Re: Possibly stupid Syncro questions

Thanks Jim, I may try them.I had T/A's on my Pathfinder several years ago and
they wore well and had decent traction in the mud in SoCal so they will
probably work in the woods up here.Ive found the 195-75-14 tires on the van
now(i got it this way) are poor in the woods.They sink in the mud and slip on
wet leaves.I ve found some great woods roads up here going from 1050-6000 ft
elev. and need to upgrade tires.It  good to hear what other guys have
experienced.I would like to find some inexpensive alloys somewhere close.See
Ya.
