Subject: Re: 76 Westy Parts, Cheap

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; A local salvage yard is going out of business and they are having a
&gt; close-out sale--$25 an arm load etc.  Bus-wise they only have a 78
&gt; pop-top Westy camper that had an engine fire, but is more or less
&gt; complete.  I plan on getting the drivetrain etc. (heavy armload!) and can
&gt; probably grab misc. parts if they aren't too big.  Let me know soon.
&gt; BTW, looks like all the camper stuff is still in it.  You'll pay
&gt; shipping, but otherwise it's windfall if it's not a huge item.
&gt;
I made my first run-through on the yard.  Someone beat me to the tranny!  
Oh well.  I plan on one more run in a few days (their last day is Sunday) 
and most of the items aren't real good as it has been sitting for a 
while.  It does have the water resevoir, upper bed (not real great) and 
front seats (yes J. Brill, highbacks), but ditto on the not-so-great shape.
It's a 76 Westy poptop.

A neat score was a 71 Saab Sonnet(?)  It had all-German VDO guages &amp; 
tach, along with oddball alloy wheels.  Also scored some Mercedes alloys 
(same bolt pattern as 71 and newer buses) for $1 each!  8-)
