Subject: DC ZOO bar

Man o man,

I'm eating my shorts on this one folks.

I am sorry to say that i did not make it to the zoo bar on Sunday seeing that 
I literally live around the corner on Cathedral and that I had proposed the 
Zoo bar to Pete(r).   I left work last Thursday after I posted the message 
that Jacques was closed and did not read any til this morning.  As I noted 
Pete, I declined a friend's invitation to walk to the little store next to 
the Zoo bar right at 615.

Be quiet west coasters we'll get this yet.

I'm willing to make amends.  I'm sorry to say I can't make the Manassas Rally 
over Mermorial weekend, seeing that I will be in Canada.

Chris Chubb had mentioned  Curious/Generous George's down in Alexandria as a 
meeting place and I will put my dime down right now saying that I will be 
there just name the time

John 70 van  voicemail 202-762-7959

ps.. if you are willing I will accept phone numbers and other in addition to 
the e-addresses I have, to develop a list to harass for the next meeting.
