Subject: Battery Removal

Greg,  I got mine out last weekend by sliding a woven back pack strap down
the side and then under one end and then under the middle.  Always keeping
both loose ends in my hand! Once this is done it is easy to lift out.
Others have used bicycle tubes etc - any thin, strong material.  When I
replaced the battery I left the belt in place for next time.  The only
problem in lifting out is to keep the cable connectors out of the way -
another pair of hands are helpful - but watch out for the battery acid!!

Good Luck - Don.
