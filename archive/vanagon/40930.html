Subject: Heads up for 78 champagne edition bus

BO&gt;This bus had unusual colors.  The exterior is 2-tone, brown bottom and
BO&gt;brick-red top, with disco stripes painted along the sides.  Interior
BO&gt;panels are red vinyl with chrome stripe accents.  The seats were
BO&gt;apparently either red vinyl with brown corduroy panels, or brown vinyl
BO&gt;with red corduroy panels, not sure which, as none of the original
BO&gt;seats came with my bus.  The dashboard, steering wheel, and related
BO&gt;plastic bits were a dark, chocolate brown color, NOT black.

I've seen this combo, once, weidest color scheme ever on a new bus,
sort of brought back splittie memories.  BTW my cocoa brown '78
camper and any late '78-'79 white over brown bus I have seen also
carries the brown dash, with brown column cover, wiper and blinker
switches.  As to the interior panels, GOOD LUCK.
