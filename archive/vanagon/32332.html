Subject: Re: Syncro Tranny Died

&gt;&gt;The tranny seems to be seized.  I was driving along (50 miles into a trip)
&gt;&gt;when I went to downshift, and I could not move the shifter at all.  I
pulled
&gt;&gt;over and that was the last the vehicle moved.  Engine and clutch is fine,
&gt;but
&gt;&gt;I cannot move the shifter and any amount of rpm and clutch slipping will
not
&gt;&gt;move it, it just stalls.  When is was loaded onto a rollback the rear
wheels
&gt;&gt;dragged, fronts rolled OK.
&gt;&gt;
Its hard to diagnose trany problems over the E-Mail but I'll give you some
suggestions.  Sounds like you blew up the 3/4 synchronizer hub(shifter
doesn't move).  Parts went flying everywher until van came to halt.  Probably
made some noises that startled other motorists!  Just finished repairing one
yesterday that failed that way.  Van was brought to me with trans &quot;In a
Basket&quot;.  It was dissasemble by a dealer.  It needed the 3/4 hub assembly,
(they all do, early poor design, stress cracks start around engagement keys),
Pinion bearing, Mainshft bearing,  2 gears in low range housing, (smashed
from hub parts),  all new synchros, seals gaskets etc.  Some other parts were
replaced with used. With a new clutch set-up,  $1800.00 put it back in the
van running.  I even filled with Mobil 1 SHC 75w-90 gear oil.  If the
ring/pinion is shot, add another $500.00.  I have many parts available and
connections to get more. The most worrisome parts are the housings.
 Sometimes these are destroyed beyond repair.  I have machined and fitted
oversize bearings.  I should be able to save you money and I stand behind my
work.
