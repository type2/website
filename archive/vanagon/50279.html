Subject: Re: VW Bus Artwork for the asking

Roy, and the rest of y'all,

The drawings that Roy has done are indeed at my web site. (Y'know one of
these days, I simply *must* write one of those &quot;home page&quot; things for
myself :-) OTOH, I do ask that anyone interested, get 'em now!  At the end
of the month I will be posting a new set of economic data, and *may* need
to remove them.  I may not, as well, depends on some factors at work that
are as yet undetermined.  (Can you tell I work for the gov't yet? :-)  At
any rate, they will surely remain thru the end of the month. 

Anyone curious about what I do to support my VW habit is welcome to visit
the other page at my site,

 http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/

It contains pointers to the data we at the Bureau of Economic Analysis
generate.  Find out how far above average you really are!

&gt; For those of you still enquiring about the VW Bus drawings, H Stephen 
&gt; Dolan's webpage still has my VW Bus drawings that you can download 
&gt; easily:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/vw/
&gt; 
&gt; Do what you want with the artwork; I'm making it available to all, to 
&gt; use however you want, for free.  If you're going to have this tatooed on 
&gt; your body, or make posters, stickers or whatever from this stuff, I 
&gt; suggest downloading the larger, crisper images (300 dpi).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun,
