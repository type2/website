Subject:      Down at the Wand Wash, (little VW, (Fun))

Here's a little excerpt from my upcoming MASSIVE post on soundproofing,
rustproofing, and the life here-after for vw owners...

...With the motor installed we turned to pulling out all of the interior
stuff in preparation for the next phase of our project, THE BODY.

We removed EVERYTHING from the interior that didn't have a heartbeat. Bare
bones, nothing but glass and metal. We drove the van to the Fairfax Circle
&quot;Wand Wash&quot;, then removed the driver's seat.

God Bless all of you who do not have a &quot;Wand Wash&quot; in your town. This is a
car-sized stall, with a drain in the middle and a high-pressure hose hanging
with a 30&quot; steel wand/nozzle at the end. Next to the stall is a little booth
where the remainder of the high-pressure hose is coiled up on the floor.
Inside this tiny booth lives a colony of little elves that go absolutely nuts
when they see an American quarter. If you pump a couple of bucks worth of
quarters into the slot into the booth, they start humming uncontrollably,
while jumping up and down on the hose making the pressure spray an incredible
1200 psi. This is very useful for cleaning.

We spent $6.00 washing every square inch of the inside of the van, allowing
the water to run out the open sliding door of the van. We paid particular
attention to the window seals, the slider tracks for the door, and to the
headliner, which I am proud to say, looks like brand new...

There's plenty more like that and I have a number of options for posting it,
probably early next week.

have a great weekend,
