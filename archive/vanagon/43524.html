Subject: RE: FS: propane tank for early Westfalia

I don't know what year the tank is for. I suspect it is for late 50's, 
early 60's, but I don't know enough about early buses to know. I figured 
that anyone that was interested could identify it from my description. It 
is significantly different from the tanks that I'm used to seeing, the ones 
that mount under the bus. This one looks like it's designed to go in the 
bus or on the back of the bus. It has a flat bottom and stands upright like 
a bottle. Looks like a welding gas bottle, only much shorter, like about 
16&quot; tall and 10&quot; in diameter. Anyone on the list know what I'm describing 
here?
