We've been using a Rhode Gear (is that the name?), which is like what
Albrecht Janders described: designed for sedans, but adjustable for rear
van hatches. I am not all too satisfied, though. With two bikes on it,
the weight puts two dents into the rear hatch, despite the foam pads.
Moreover, dust will sneak in between the foam pads and the paint and with
the vibration will scratch the paint.

I would much rather be able to place the bikes to the front of the bus,
attached to the spare tire. I figure this should be better in terms of
weight distribution, plus you can monitor the bikes all the time, in case
they get loose. I've seen bike carriers for external spare tires on Jeeps
so I know they exist. But would anyone know whether the spare holding
fixture is strong enough to carry two bikes in addition to the spare
wheel? 

Oh, and while I'm dreaming, doesn't Martin Schneider DS fabricate a brush
guard for breadloaves. Perhaps the bikes could be attached to that, instead?
