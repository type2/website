Subject: Re:Brazilian clutch etc

If you can affors it always go for German parts - we have to use brazilian
things like kingpins etc...but although good the quality is not as good as the
German...basically you get whay you pay for. I fitted a Brazilian clutch and
plate in my bus and it wore out in about 14 months...the german one I now have
was more expensive but you coukd see anf feel the difference when it was on
the counter. Still needs must etc....
