Subject: '54 Deluxe Progress?

        Ok, so I haven't done squat to the '54 in the last month.  I've been
busy behind the scenes getting everything ready.  I've put in new
workbenches and shelves in the garage, got a new air compressor, a
sandblaster, and 200 lbs of media.  I also got a propane fired heater and
some 6 mil plastic and what not for (hopefully) not making too much of a mess.

        This weekend I'm going to fire up the sandblaster for the first
time, which should be interesting.  We're (Dean &quot;busfarmr&quot; Anderson) and I
are going to make a small booth with the plastic so it will be easier to
recover the media and not make such a mess.
