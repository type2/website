Subject: FS: No code Heidelberg cassette radio

FOR SALE:

Heidelberg Cassette Radio, 1986 Vanagon factory option

perfect working condition;
owner's manual with installation instructions included.

asking $175.00 + shipping and COD charges.

This unit does not have the anti-theft code circuitry and buttons, it
was manufactured by Matsushita in Japan just before the code feature
was added to Heidelberg radios.  The radio is VW part # 161 035 180 C
(superseded). I can attest that the FM reception in this radio is
outstanding.

I had a car stereo store replace it in my '86 Westy with a Philips
DC-777 cassette radio which has the shortwave bands in it.  This
required installing two more wires (ground) to the rear speakers;
they did a good job, following the same path as the other wires that
connect the rear speakers.  When I'm camping, I just connect a longwire
antenna to the Vanagon's antenna mast to boost the shortwave reception.
