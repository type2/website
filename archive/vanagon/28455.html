Subject: Top o' the World tour

Hey now,
        Just checked out the web page (which for the uninitiated is at
http://www.chaco_dot_com/~coyote/trek/  ), saw the &quot;why?&quot; portion-which says
&quot;you tell me&quot;. Ok, I will. I know why; because it's there! Now wasn't that
easy?  BTW, my SO is now really into the idea, so if we can scrounge the
cash, we'll be there. Whoopiee!!!! Now all I gotta do is get the bus into
shape... gee, what a bummer.  ;-)

Peace,
