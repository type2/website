Subject: YooHoo! I got reverse now!

I finished putting in my tranny and brakes.  It's great having reverse,
and the new tranny is alot quieter on the freeway than the old one.  The
the fourth is a bit higher than the last one.  It spins about 3700 RPM at
60 MPH now as oppsed to almost 4000 before.  I think I'll need a little
stonger engine if I want to go much faster.  And I can now stop in a
straight line, no more of the pulling to the right. 

On a side note, I got a Harbor Freight order that included thier 21 
piece, $46 3/4 inch drive sockets set.  Looks pretty nice for the price.  
I also got a $15, 40 piece metric die and tap set that had one piece that 
was not cut right.  Thier customer service said they'll send me a 
replacement.  I also got a $9 winshield washer kit, comes with all I need 
to make it work in my bus (I already have the nozzles on my bus).
