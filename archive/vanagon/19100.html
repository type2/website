get the plug taken care of if you have time and $$ now... unless your wife is
accepting of fix-it-when-it-breaks side adventures...

        My wife and I will be going to Maine (and back) in our 71 camper on 
June 22.  It is 800 miles one way, and I was wondering what I should bring, 
and what I should check.  The only thing which is bugging me about the bus 
is the frozen #4 plug.  It has been in there for who knows how long, and I 
plan to run it until the plug fails.  Does anyone have an idea of how long a 
plug will last in a 1600?  I've put almost 2k on it since I installed it in 
late April, and have had few problems.  

TIA.
