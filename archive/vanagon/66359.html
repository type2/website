Hi All,

Just read the post by Peter Larsson with refference to his 1994 Eurovan
Doublecab Diesel Syncro.

Question: Why have we not seen any Eurovan Diesel Syncros over here in the
USA? After all, there is little about the new Eurovan to tempt the Vanagon
Westie owner into mortgate-like car payments......&quot;but a Eurovan Diesel Syncro
Camper&quot; that would be a different story. Cheap to run and maintain, and an
engine to last? I (like many who drive 2wd Westies) still suffer from the old
&quot;Syncro Envy&quot;, great for snowy climates like Alaska!


I have looked at the EV Campers on our local VW lot and I must say they look
low, I'd say they have less ground clearance than my 88 Westie! Until I see a
Syncro out there I'm not interested in even a test drive. Does the NEW Syncro
have a little extra ground clearance like the old Vanagon Syncro?

Please let us know about the new Syncros!

Regards,
Chris Gibbs

PS. Maybe Peter can FedEx us one or two from Sweden ;-)

Hi Chris,
guess to ship the stuff from Europe to America would be the least problem. You
talk about a NEW EuroVan Diesel syncro. Well as the Eurovan syncro has been
sold since 1992 it si likely to ba the OLD syncro in a few years. According to
news published in July  (see
&gt;http://www.vanagon_dot_com/info/news/new_transporter_2001.html&lt; ) VW is working
on 4x4 vehicles and there is some chance for a new 4x4 T5 Transporter using
AUDI quattro components and engines around the turn of the milleneium.

Recently they presented the EuroVan (T4) syncro TDI (2,5l 102 HP) which lacks
a bit of ground clearance but is very fast and convenient on paved roads.

In case you want to support a 4x4 VW Transporter project write your ideas to:
