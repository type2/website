Subject: unusual event

This morning on the way to work, I stopped at a convenience store for gas
just outside Flagstaff.  I was the only soul around.  Shortly afterward,
a guy pulls up in a '70 Westfalia, and almost at the same time, a guy
on a bicycle with a gas can in his hand pulls up.  It turned out that the
guy on the bike *also* has a '70 Westfalia! (perhaps with a broken gas
gage?)  A regular impromptu Bus club meeting!  This place is out there
aways, so it's unusual to get three people getting gas at the same time,
let alone three Bus owners!

I asked the first guy if he knew of any good VW shops in Flagstaff, 
whereupon he proudly thrust his thumbs under his suspenders and says 
&quot;Ah do all muh own work!!&quot;.  He then climbed into his ride, wound up
the starter, sputtered to life, and roared away on three cylinders!

Jeez, I hope this guy isn't on this list!

Dave
'71 Westfalia &amp; SB
