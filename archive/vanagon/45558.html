Subject: Cancelling Axle Seminar - VA

I went out this evening and found that the axle that I was going to swap
into my bus is as bad as the axle coming out (~1/4&quot; of play in the relay
shaft {ouch!}).  As a result there will be *no* axle swapping done tomorrow.
:-(  Those of you who were planning to come, Thanks! and Hold that thought!
