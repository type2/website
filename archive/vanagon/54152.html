ye gods and little fishes...!

  reminds me of the time when, heading for washington st. from s.f. with
a load of small kids and a wife, i limped into bend, ore., with a
sputtering '68 bus and a kindly roadside gas station mechanic advised me
that no. 3 exhaust valve had blown, that he could fix it within maybe 72
hours, adding that a reasonable motel was nearby, and that the repair
would cost only slightly more than an arm and a leg.  in purple shock, i
stuck my head into the rear hatch a bit, noticed the sparkplug wire on
no. 2 had jiggled off, reattached it, and engine fired back to life.  
this archcriminal's response was, of course, silence... the engine ran
fine for many more years.
