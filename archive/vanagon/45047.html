Subject: Lowering Busses, etc

I must interject to the list snobs here.  I have been wanting to lower my
'85 Westy Wolfsburg.  Before the snobs delete...The reason for this
desire is that my Vanagon rides 2-3 inches higher in the front than in the
back.  I know I am not the only one with this situation.  For the
snobs/purists, I believe that my Westy would ride better, and maybe even
look like an 80-83 or a 86-90 Vanagon. Why would that be so horible?
I am ready....Flame away  8-)
