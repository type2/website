Subject: My power locks in 95/EV have gone crazy

Hey Now,
 When I unlock the drivers side door on my EV the power locks cycle
continuously while you have the door open and automaticly locks
as soon as you shut the door. When you locks or unlock the locks
from the passenger side door they work properly. Does anyone know
how to disable the power locks? I looked in the oweners manual and
the fuse that controlles the central locking also controlls the
domelight and some other stuff that I don't want to stop working.
I don't know how to get the doors apart to disable the locks idependently.
Any ideas? I am calling my VW dealer today to see what they say.

Robert
