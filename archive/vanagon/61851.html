Subject: FS: &quot;73 westy automatic: Alabama

Hello All:

I have a friend who has a '73 westy automatic he wants to sell.

He bought it in Feb. and took it to a sorry-ass piece of SH*T
mechanic named Dewayne Allan in Birmingham, AL. Who proceeded to 
rip him off and leave him $525 poorer.  While Dewayne was doing his
dirty business.  My friend pulled the tranny and took it to be 
rebuilt at a transmission place. He also bought a new Weber 
progressive carb for it.  Well, Dewayne supposedly had the heads
rebuilt and reinstalled them.  Whoever did the rebuild on the heads
is a blithering idiot!  When they were reinstalled #1&amp;2 side was 
leaking air.  Then got that fixed and the #3&amp;4 side stud that
holds the manifold tubes pulled out and is leaking air on that side.....

To make a long story short, he wants out.  He wants to cut his losses
and get whatever he can back out of this bus and find a manual bus.
He has roughly ~$1600 invested and fully realizes that he will not be able
to get what he has in it. make him an offer and you will have the bus.
It is immobile so you will either have to tow it or get it running first.

As some of you know you I am in the middle of R&amp;R my engine and
a host of other things and can't deal with it now.

If you are interested or know someone is is contact me or him.
