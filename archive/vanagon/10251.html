&gt; It's not a problem if you don't run the heater.  It's probably a
&gt; leaking core.  My 85 has been this way for a bout 3 years.  I just
&gt; don't use it.

Some would argue that you risk the chance of pulling air into the coolant
system as the coolant contracts from cooling.  If you have had no problem
for the past 3 years, maybe it's an invalid argument.
