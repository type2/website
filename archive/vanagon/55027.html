Subject: Re: Bob Lewis VW? EV MV?

Thad asked:

&gt; 1) What is the difference between an EV MV and an EV GL? Is either
bigger or &gt;roomier inside? I found what sounds like a nice EV in maine
-- MV93, 29,500 mi., &gt;camper, extra seats, 17,500. Sound worth it?
There is also a 93 GL in todays paper &gt;(San Jose) which brings me to
the next question:
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Anybody have any dealings with Bob Lewis VW in San Jose? That
last
&gt; GL is through him.

The MV has two theater style, rear facing seats in the middle, the GL
has
a two seat, front facing bench in the middle.  They're both about the
same
amount of room, although I imagine the MV's seats are easier to remove
than
the GL's.

Regarding question number two; when we were shopping around for our
MV,
Bob Lewis had the largest selection of EVs.  Being a volume dealer,
they also tend to be somewhat &quot;slimey&quot;  'Nuf said.  However, if you DO
have to deal with them, I hear Steve Lewis (Bob's son) is an OK guy...
We've never purchased a vehicle from them and the closest we got was
almost
buying a '92 Corrado SLC from them, which was a (typically) unpleasant
experience.

If you want a poptop camper for your family, you want an MV w/ the 
Weekender option, or one of the Winnie EV conversions ('95 on).
