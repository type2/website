Subject: Vanagon rocker covers??

Hi all, the rockers on my '87 Syncro GL are covered in what looks like 
leftover adhesive goop. Any ideas what was there before? Ground effects 
skirt? Hah. The goop is on both sides, full length between wheels. Cleaning 
it off for repainting is going to be a chore. My '85 was cleanly painted 
down there, no chipguard, nothing but smooth paint, so I'm puzzled. No 
ground effects airdam up front on the '87, regular square tin bumpers. Any 
takers? TIA, tim s.
