&gt;Thom,
&gt;I would be interested in a price breakdown of your entire
&gt;project.  I know that it would be a bit of a bitch to do 
&gt;but I'm contemplating something along the same lines that

Actually, it won't be that bad.  I have a spreadsheet with all of the major
parts listed on it, and I've kept most of the receipts.  I haven't updated
this sheet in a few weeks, but it wouldn't take but an hour max to
bring it up to date.

I haven't kept real close track of what I've spend on sandpaper and
primer and filler, what I can &quot;expendables&quot; so I'll have to guess.
I'm kinda wastefull with some of that stuff anyway, and I've been
experimenting a lot...

Thom
