I'm not too far from this establishment, about a half hour or so.  I
have been in there once.  Unfortunately, they didn't have what I 
needed.  I inquired about prices on a few other things f comparison
purposes, and they seemed sort of &quot;mid-range.&quot;  Perhaps ordering
from them thru 'net will gain a better discount?  They did
seem to have a lot of Audi things...
