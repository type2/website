Subject: RE:  Rust in seams


&gt;My 84 has the slight indication of rust in the seams along the
&gt;drivers side.  How quickly does this progress?  I am thinking about
&gt;trading up into a later model van, like a 89 or similar, but I have
&gt;done so much mechanical on my 84 I don't want to take on another head
&gt;job etc.  Should I worry about the rust, or is it a slowly progessing
&gt;problem?  Any opinions welcome.


My favorite anti-rust trick:

Get some motor oil and a small paint brush or eyedropper, and dab the
oil liberally onto the rust. THIS WORKS ESPECIALLY WELL IN SEAMS!
Wipe up any obvious dribbles, then let the oil spread over the metal
and rust areas (as oil does so well-- ever gotten a little on your
fingers, and found it all over your hands ten minutes later?

It locks out both air and water, and stops the rust cold. After a few
months, it will tend to wear off somewhat, so re-do it every 6 months
or so. Cheap, handy, effective!
