... shitty details omitted ... :)                                              
&gt;Guarteed odorless: design eliminates foul odor problems that are               
&gt;characteristic of other systems. written guarantee &quot; toilet gives off no       
&gt;foul odors inside or outside.                                                  
                                                                                
ahem. as one well acquainted from personal experience with TWO different        
aspects of the burning of human waste (&lt;1&gt;worked for the sewer dept. back       
home; &lt;2&gt;worked for my Uncle Samuel, in his Southeast Asia Police Dept.         
(see movie &quot;Platoon&quot; for details of said burning techniques)), i feel it        
necessary to comment here: bullshit.                                            
                                                                                
it STINKS. it burns, but it stinks. trust me. El Grande Stinko.                 
                                                                                
&gt;Capaicity: can be used 40 to 60 times in succession before incineration        
&gt;is neccessary.                                                                 
                                                                                
sounds more and more like those old oil drums we used in the army. cept we      
used diesel fuel instead of propane.

no, really, folks: it does smell. :)
