&gt;&gt;&gt;At any rate, I'd like to see the results of the great hidden key 
&gt;&gt;&gt;search.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, all I got was a face full of dried up mouse poop and dirt when I 
&gt;&gt;investigated the heater hose on my '75 westy. No keys though.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;*Careful* with that mouse poop! Seriously, someone died last year
&gt;from cleaning up around mouse poop. Seems that inhaling it can result

Ahah!!!! so that's why he wanted us all to look into our heater tubes!
Roy Robertson secretly wanted all of us type 2 owners who were stupid enough to
rip our heater hoses apart - to die of mouse poop poisoning!!!!!!!

just kidding, Roy  ya know, a little mouse poop humor.........
4 days premature.....
