&gt; &gt;I would drain it after the trip and check for metal, but have been told
&gt; &gt;that it's a real pain to get new fluid back in the unit, that you have to
&gt; &gt;&quot;pump it in&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Sound correct?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's the best, but I used Castrol 80/90 oil which comes in a squeeze 
&gt; bottle with tip like a caulking tube. I added about 18&quot; of vinyl tubing and 
&gt; it worked fine. Not fun though, on your back, spilling oil periodically, 
&gt; while holding the bottle upside down in the wheel well. You need a 17mm 
&gt; Allen key to get out the plugs, screw 2 17 mm nuts really tightly together 
&gt; on a 17 mm bolt then use it with a wrench to turn the plug out.  Use the 
&gt; same thing to get the drain plug out, it IS a pain. tim s.
&gt; 
Two things-
1. your life will be millions of times easier if you get the little hand
pump that attaches to the mouth of the trans. oil bottle. It is only
like $3.00, and is a lifesaver. (I had trans. leaks for a while, and
used to have to fill it every 200 miles or so...)
2. Bugpack makes a 17mm hex head that fits on a standard 3/8&quot; ratchet.
Another great thing.
