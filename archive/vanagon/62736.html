I've tried screw extractors 3 times, each time without success.  Plus, 
I've read post after post in this and other newgroups about the problems 
with using these things.  Maybe it's one of those things somebody needs 
to show you how to do, or maybe you need more mechanical aptitude than I 
have, but I've sworn off using them.
