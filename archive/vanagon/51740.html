Subject: Just won't stall-thanks to all

Thanks to all for the help posted and e-mailed, I solved the ongoing &quot;run
for a half hour and stall/strand&quot; routine in my 84.  After installing new
coil, capacitor in harness trick, filters I found hole in the underside of
the vaccum line connected to the fuel regulator(?).  This hole apparently
made der motor think it was no longer running, so fuel delivery was
unnecessary.  Replace all those old vac.lines, it sure beats walking.
