 I have in my possession a highroof for an older bus I lifted it off an a
early 70's bus and had intended to put it on mine but a loose fuel line
clamp put an end to that idea and that bus. That was a few years ago I
still have the roof gingerly suspended from the roof of a rented garage
that I am soon to vacate. It is a pain to move it the 2 hours from its
current local to int's new home and I would still have no use for it.
Anyone interested in it can E-mail me personally or here publically. It is
about 2-2 1/2' feet tall and full length. It has two side windows wich
slide back and forth but needs new glass. It is fiberglass and as of yet
uncracked (the next move for it might not be so kind to it)
        I also have a aftermarket sunroof for a beetle. The Roof would like a
token donation for it, The sunroof is easily moved so I'm not hot to sell
it but it is available.
        ALso a windshield for a early 70's Bus dusty but whole.

          Let me know
                        Vinnie
