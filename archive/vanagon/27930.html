Subject: Thanks re: head gasket sealant

Thanks to all those who answered my query about finding head gasket sealant
for
my '84 Vanagon; Doug Jones, Joel Walker, Brian Verbeek, Alex Munro, and 
especially Don Kane who is sending me his leftover tube from his project.
In case anyone's interested, I was told by a dealer in Atlanta that the
reason
for the backorder was a recall on the Fox that used up all the sealant in the
country.

The best news from all my searching was that I found this list! I have
enjoyed
reading all the posts on various subjects and am pleased that there are so
many
friendly and helpful (and funny) people here.
