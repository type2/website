Subject: Reasonable source for parts?


Hi,
Does anyone know a reasonable source for parts for an '80 Vanagon?
I need the small gas struts that hold the tailgate open. The VW dealer here
(State College, PA) wants $140. I think this is preposterous, but he is the
only game in town. I'd appreciate any tips on reasonable mail-order sources
for new (or used) parts.

Thanks a bunch.

Still looking for an 85 or newer Westy to replace the '80.  Please let me know if
you know about someone who knows about someone that has one for sale.
