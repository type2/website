Subject: replacing fuel lines

If you are going to be replacing your entire fuel line, consider fitting the
fuel line with a valve.  This valve, if placed near the fuel tank, is useful
when removing an engine.  Instead of pulling off the hose and getting sprayed
with gas, one can shut off the fuel supply before removing anything.

I have not set this up in my 1970 camper, but I plan to when I remove the
engine for cleaning and maintenance.  I have not yet found a suitable valve
or petcock, so I can't recommend what kind of valve to use.
