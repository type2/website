Subject: Bentley Manuals-Cheap Source


I talked to a distribution house today (whose name I do not know) about a
Jeep manual. Good prices. Turns out they also carry the Bentley manuals.

Price quoted for the 68-79 Bus manual was $35.00. Second-day ground
shipping was an additional $4.

The number is 216-572-0725.
