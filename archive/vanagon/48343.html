Subject: Solar-Powered 1969 VW Van


Those of you interested in photo-voltaics or renewable 
energy may be interested to read about Don Kulha's 1969 bus 
featured in the August/September issue of Home Power 
magazine.

Don has mounted 5 Siemens modules on a rack atop his van.  
The array produces 24 amps of current at 14.5 VDC, or approx 
375 watts.  With inverter, controller, batteries etc. he has 
added $4,421 of investment and 400 pounds of weight to the 
bus.

There is an extremely cool photo of his campsite, all lit up 
with renewable power!
