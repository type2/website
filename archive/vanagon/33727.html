The '57 single cab is a rusty POS in the back half  but runs great and
 hasn't cost much at all.

Tim Parker described some vocabulary clarification...
&gt;Anyway, that's my personal definition of a thrasher.  A POS is a
&gt;fundamentally different animal, requiring either sloppy workmanship, or a
&gt;basic focus on quantity, rather than quality, in the vehicle's manufacture.
 
At risk of sounding like vintagvw list, the '57 single is a definite
thrasher with about enough bondo to sound like a city side walk when
knocking on the drivers side and looks like Davey Jone's locker near the
rocker panels and doglegs. The front cab half is basically great, as are the
gates (go figure) Cubby door hanging on with coat hanger wire. Doors rattle
like your standing under the Chicago &quot;el&quot; tracks. No low beams and only the
passgr side tail light/stop light. Cracked windshields with virtually slight
remains of fossilized seals holding them in. Paint job is misc oxide and
cheap grey primer with occasional rattle can tests &lt;exactly what I mean&gt;
here and there. The hoops and stays were pushed back an inch due to a low
over hang. Makes it look fast even when it's still. ;) Empty semaphore holes
with the wires hanging bare and no hub caps round out the look.  Drips like
a bad dog in heat. The new neighbors love it &lt;not&gt;. Hauls butt though! It is
a friendly and charming POS, too. ;) Hence the name &quot;Rusty VanBondo.&quot;

&gt;&gt;Oh yeeah, we call the teeny neons and GEO, Yugos etc &quot;Kitty&quot; boxes. The
name has been altered for the list. ;)
&gt;Feel free to tell me to jump off, if you wish!  8^)
&gt;&gt; only if it makes you feel better =)  Lets drop the thread.
