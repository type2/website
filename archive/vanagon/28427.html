Subject: seatbelts and airbags

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, I don't know about MD law, but I do know about my cars.  My '63
&gt;&gt;Dodge has none.  My '65 Chevy has only two seat belts, but can seat six.
&gt;&gt;And my '66 Kombi only had 2 front belts, and one front seat, I added
&gt;&gt;anther front seat, and a rear bench including seat belts.
&gt;
&gt;My dad's '60 Sunbeam Alpine came from the factory with seat belts.
&gt;So did his '63 Ford Falcon van.
&gt;
I was in an Alfa Romeo once that had a placard on the rear seat that said:

    &quot;WARNING rear seat not for occupation while car is in motion&quot;

No seatbelts of course.
