Subject: RE: AC Blowing Out Black Material

That black stuff is the filter material after the evaporator.  It main 
function is to collect the water that condenses on the coil and keep it from 
blowing into the ductwork with the air.  It also collects dust and pollen 
which is then carried away with the water as it drains down.  It should be 
replaced. Without it, water will start spraying out the vents.  It is a hell 
of a job as the cabinetry has to be disassembled.  The material gets ruined 
from the heat in the Van when parked in the sun with everything closed.  Go to 
an AC supplier and get metal screening like that used on range hoods to 
replace that plastic junk.

Subject:	AC Blowing Out Black Material

Lately when I have been running the A/C on my 88 Westy the unit has been
blowing out bits of a black plastic material that looks like it is from
some kind of air filter that has been chopped up by the A/C fan.  The
A/C seems to work OK but I wonder if I should be concerned about this,
what is goning on, and whether I should have it fixed.

Also is it possibe to upgrade the A/C on an 88 Westy to run on the new
(R134?) refigerent? Are there kits available and who should I have do
it. Hopefully not my VW dealership.  As you may know the A/C on an 88 is
different, the entire unit is in the rear roof with outlits in the rear
only (beacuse of the pop-top).
