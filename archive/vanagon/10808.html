Subject: Re: Syncro Parts Costs FYI

&gt;Derek, will you be my parts guy? You seem to be good/lucky/smart at
&gt;getting parts at super prices.

&gt;I am fairly interested in a syncro rear locking tran and diff. if it is
&gt;possibel to fit into my 82.


&gt;Half seriously,

&gt;Alistair

Installing a syncro trans is a good but risky way to improve the traction of 
all vanagons, even two wheel drive vanagons such as Alistair's.

The idea is that it adds the capability to lock up the rear diff at any time,

a maneuver that would greatly increase the offroad traction of a two wheel
drive vanagon. Also, you get a granny gear for going slowly on bad 
terrain. 

The risky part is that some evidence exists which suggests, very tentatively,
that the syncro trans is more likely to break down. When it does break 
down, it is hard to find a used replacement part. A reconditioned, used, 
syncro trans at the dealer is supposed to cost around $4,000. 

Go figure.
