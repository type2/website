Tom:

Try sticking a long screwdriver from the back through one of the holes in
the brake plate (those that give access to the adjuster stars). That way
the tip of the screwdriver should touch the drum from inside. Now hit the
screwdriver with a hammer, turn the wheel a few degrees, hit again, and so
on until the drum is unwedged. Hope this helps.

Sorry I couldn't CC this. Don't have your address.

Sami
