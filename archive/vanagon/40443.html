Subject: RE: Tranny/Engine mounts for T4-&gt;T1 engine conv.?


&gt;Anybody know if I could take a later baywindow and drop my ('70)
&gt;engine/tranny combo into it?


I recently owned a '71 bus with a '70 single-port engine, which I think
was bolted to the original '71 transmission (are the transmissions
different from '70 to '71? I don't know).

Ran well enough-- nice and peppy, especially for a single-port, and I've
heard that single-port engines are tougher than dual-ports because they
have less tendency to develop cracks from the spark plug holes to the
intake ports when stressed.

Two things to watch for:

1.) '71 is the first year (in the U.S.) for busses to come with front
power disc brakes standard. These are wonderful-- a vast improvement
over the standard front drums on '70 and older in the U.S. But they
require a vacuum tap into the intake manifold of the engine, which U.S.
single-port engines don't have. You can fabricate one pretty easily, I
think (mine already had one, looked homemade), or you can drive around
with very stiff brakes. This is safe once you get used to using a LOT of
pressure on the pedal.

2.) '71s had dualport engines with the doghouse fan shroud and offset
oil cooler. Most single-port engines don't have this, unless someone's
modified them. They let the engine run cooler, which is VERY important
in a bus. There are kits available to change to a doghouse, and it's
a pretty easy swap once the engine is out of the car.

Hope this helps.
