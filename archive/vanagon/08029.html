I have had a similiar oil pressure warning light and buzzer problem, however
it is not related to cold temperatures.  Actually perhaps the opposite.
After cruising the turnpike at 65-70 for over 1 hour when I  slow down on
the exit ramp, the oil light at warning buzzer will come on.  If I momentarily
depress the clutch and rev the engine for a couple of seconds, the warning
light/buzzer go out.  This may repeat for several times over the next
several miles of slower driving.

Its been irratic.  Hasn't done it in the last 5 months.  The dealer didn't
know what it was.  Suggested perhaps the pressure relief valve.  I also do not
know which sensor is responsible for the buzzer warning.  I haven't checked
the Bentley manual in awhile, but it seemed like the buzzer warning may
somehow be indicating which sensor is acting up, but this may be my
imagination!!!

&gt;I and my trusty 87 vanagon have recently acquired a cold-oil warning
system that works as follows:   In weather colder than 45 deg, after van
sits more than 8-10 hours, get in, start, drive away.   After revs go
over 2500-3000 for a short period, combination low oil pressure and dive
warning horn comes on.   After the van is warm, warning light/horn never
comes on.  (the current solution is to idle the van until warm before
