&gt;&amp; 2.) The GREAT heater it had! Original heater boxes, I'm pretty sure.
&gt;&amp; I would start from Boulder when it was like 10 below Farenheit at
&gt;&amp; night. By the time I was 10 minutes out of town, the whole bus
&gt;&amp; was warm enough that I could take off my goosedown jacket and drive
&gt;&amp; comfortably in shirtsleeves. Fact!
&gt;
&gt;Mustabeen an alien bus. From the other side of the moon where
&gt;temperature drops to 130K. Jens.


Could be... that would explain the tanks full of strange gas behind
the driver's seat when I got it, and the three-buttock imprint on the
seat itself???

But the heater really did work as I described. And could again, I
suspect, with the correct (internally finned) heater boxes.

Removing those little heat-spreaders under the rear seat probably
helped, too. In summer, I covered them with foil and a hose clamp.
