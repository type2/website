&lt;I totally, completely disagree with WHellmer who says the electrical &lt;load
on an alternator does not significantly affect the effort required &lt;to turn
the alternator.
ok

&lt;If this were true, the alternator would either be very inefficient and
&lt;difficult to turn at low loads, or, at high load we would be getting 
&lt;something for nothing. 
the first part is true. an alternator tends to be both innefficient and 
somewhat more difficult to turn at low loads.

&lt; Sorry, no free lunch. 
you are correct, but if you shop around you may find better values 
for your money.
..
&lt;Just where do you think this electrical energy comes from? From &lt;the torque
turning the shaft. (And in our VWs from the engine, and, &lt;thus from the
gasoline.)
no argument here. my point isn't where the power comes from or even the fact
that mechanical power is consumed to drive the &quot;alternator&quot;. i maintain that
the alternator does not consume a signifigant amount of additional mechanical
energy as its electrical
loads increase. 

&lt;In fact, the turning effort is directly proportional to load. 
this is not true of &quot;bosch&quot; alternator's as well as most alternators in
general. 

&lt;(In an old carburated engine, the idle speed will drop down when &lt;you turn
on the lights or other big draw). In all portable and RV &lt;generator sets
(which are now all alternators) look at the specs for &lt;fuel consumption;
they're directly proportional to electrical load. &lt;When large loads are
instantly applied, the engines bog down for a &lt;second or two until their
automatic throttle can pour on more fuel. In &lt;fact, they warn you not to run
the gen sets with no loads or light &lt;loads for a long time. Why, because the
engines won't warm up &lt;properly and they'll carbon up. Without a load on the
alternator, the &lt;engine has almost no work to do. With a load, it has lots of
work to &lt;do. 
&lt;(If this weren't the case, why not just use a little tiny 2hp &lt;lawnmower
engine on a 10KW generator?). Look in any catalog, 
&lt;the higher the rated output, the larger the engine.
most generators (both portable and rv) are designed to operate over a very
limited range of rpm. in fact the motor for these devices is specifically
dedicated to producing electrical power; to the point where the governor is
controlled by electreical demand.these devices typically have a steady state
differential rpm range of only 500 to 1000 and put out straight ac.  i am
restraining from conjecturing on these devices because i am not readily
familliar with their specific individual designs, but as far as i can see
they have a pretty &quot;user friendly environment&quot;.  an alternator doesn't have
it nearly so well off. 
faced with rpm's from about 1000 to 5000 it is expected to put out a constant
dc voltage no matter what the rpm available to it. as far as i'm concerned
alternators make the best of a rather bad situation. i suspect that these so
called &quot;generators&quot; aren't true alternators, because alternators aren't as
capable of producing electrical power as generator type devices over limited
rpm ranges.

&lt;If you still don't believe me, find an old bicycle headlight generator. 
&lt;Short the outputs. It will be almost impossible to spin with your &lt;hand or
bike. Unshort it with no load. You can spin it with your &lt;finger tips.
I am quite familliar with this feature on my commuter bike which has 
a bottom bracket mounted union generator. you are correct in describing the
above events but the analagy is not valid. a typical bicycle generator is a
series wound &quot;generator&quot; and carries very little electrical resemblance to an
&quot;alternator&quot;. there is no phase modification and the power factor can be
presumed constant etc...
in a series wound generator the armature, magnetic field, and load are in
series and therefore all &quot;see&quot; approximately the same current. as a result
the faster i pedal the more current i produce and the resistance in the light
bulb's element makes the light burn brighter and it becomes somewhat more
difficult to pedal. this all happens in a very linear fashion; increased
electrical load requiring increased mechanical input.

this is not how an alternator functions.let me try and go one step further
back into the theory. basically there is no difference in the electrical and
mechanical designs between dc generators and dc motors. a dc generator will
&quot;motor&quot; and a dc motor will &quot;generate&quot;.
for me motors are easier to think about and there is certainly more available
data regarding motors. take a sereis dc generator which is being driven by an
external power source. according to lenz's law
the reaction of the induced currents tends to oppose the motion which
produces the currents. thus, when the armature is forceably driven ( by the
external source) the magnomotive force of the armature in it's reaction to
the magnetic field will oppose the direction of rotation. this is true of all
dc generators/motors whether they be wired in series, shunt or combination.
for reference vw &quot;generators&quot; are wired in shunt.  

the difference between an alternator and a generator is mainly from 
the alternater's ability to manipulate the ac before it is rectified to dc.
an alternator operates on the principal inductive reactance. there is a 
distinct relationship between the electrical phase angle of ac from the 
spinning multipolar magnetic field and the electrical phase angle of the ac
in the stationary stator winding. this is similar to the principal in a
synchronous ac motor in which these two phases are matched pole for pole
(power factor = 100). the angle of lag is the phase difference between these
two waveforms. the amount and polarity of this lag is what regulates the
output by changing the alternator's power factor. the power factor may be
thought of as the efficiency of the load- the ratio of apparent power to
total power. power factor denotes that portion of current supplied to a
system which is performing useful work. the portion of current not doing
useful work is 
maintaining/regulating the power field in th rotor. this current, although it
is called reactive load, does not require engine power to maintain it. as the
power factor goes up the total current supplied to a constant power demand
will go down. a high power factor will result in full engine load at less
than alternator rated amperage. the power factor of a synchronous motor
(alternators too!) may be varied by excitation of the magnetic field. an
underexcited field causes a lagging power factor and also increases the ac
stator current. at normal excitation the power factor is approximately 100%
and the ac stator current is minnimum. by over exciting the field the power
factor will lead and the ac stator current will then increase. this variation
in the exciter current is how an alternator regulates its output as i stated
in my original post. 

dc motors /generators do not intentionally modify the phase angles and
therefore have no power factor. they get their regulation
by increasing and reducing the back emf (this is the evil power robbing
symptom everybody has been referring to in their posts.)

now i did _not_ prove that there are little genies and fairies on treadmills
in your alternator producing free electrical power. 
instead your alternator wastes power while under low load conditions
and thus appears to magiacally produce greater electrical output without a
correspondingly large mechanical input as increased electrical demand is
encountered.

so my point in all this is, why heck i done fergot what my point was;
oh yeah. my point is grab yer keys, put some beer in the fridge (for
when you get to where ever it is your going) turn the lights on, crank some
tunes and enjoy some power because even ifnya don't use it
yer gonna pay for it anyways.

 p.s. to anyone still bored enough to be reading, i sincerely apologize
        for all the technobabble.
