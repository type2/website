Subject:      Re: Eurovan Timing Belt/ Waterpump seized!

I know nothing about Eurovans, but back when I had Japanese cars, my dad
taught me that whenever you change a timing belt in a car that the belt
drives the H2O pump, change the pump 'cause it's not worth the trouble to
go back in when the pump goes bad.  Of course it was about 100 times easier
to change a timing belt AND pump on my old Honda than to change the H2O
pump in our '90 Vanagon.

BTW, the water pump I got from you, Kyle, still pumping away.
