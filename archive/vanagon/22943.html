Subject: The Silver Socket is a factory option, M***, I think, Adverse Condtions questions

	I got a copy of Tobin Copley's find, &quot;Driving In Adverse Conditions&quot;
by VAG- it gives an M number for a dashboard powersocket- the dread 
Silver Socket? Its a factory option- it was never clear to me if it
took a special plug (DIN?) or a cigaret lighter plug... anyway, Martha's
got one, that thing. Its recomended for adverse conditions, though
they don't say why. Perhaps for the hand held spotlight or additional
air-blower they also recomend.

	Is this something everyone else knew? I can bring in the M
number tomorrow if it matters. (We're hardly going to be ordering
new Vanagons from the factory, alas.) 


	The same document recomends&quot;Anti Dazzle Strips&quot;, being
affixed to the inside of the windshield, and not legal for vehicles
operated in the Federal Republic of Germany (as it was then). Anyone
have a clue what these are? 
	Could they be something to encourage your irises to contract,
like a reflective tape or light-colored or phosphorescent object
placed in the periphery of the driver's vision path? 


	Finally, the document (this is starting to sound like The
Celistine Prophesy...) describes rubber-bag car-jacks, operated
by engine exhaust. Lay it under the car, connect to the exhaust,
run engine, raise car, close valve, change tire or whatever. 
Sylvia Plath jokes optional. A regular jack is certainly simpler,
probably faster and likely safer, but what a cool idea! Has anyone
ever seen one for sale?
