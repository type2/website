&gt;I have an '89 Westfalia camper that seems to be running hot. The temp gauge
&gt;tends to run above the red light on the gauge, even when it is cool outside.

I don't know if this is feasible, but is there a way you could
double-check your gauge's accuracy by dropping the sensor in hot water and
compare it to the reading of a reliable thermometer?
