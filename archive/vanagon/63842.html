&gt;  So I brought it to an RV dealer (Media Camping in Media PA).  Last time 
&gt;I filled up the propane tank I saw gas leaking out of the fillup valvue. 
&gt;I wanted a pro to look into that before we went away.  While I was 
&gt;getting that fixed I also wanted an estimate on the refrigerator.  It 
&gt;worked two way and we usually used coolers.  I made it clear that I would 
&gt;take the unit without any work on the refrigerator, I wanted an estimate 
&gt;on the frig and I had to have the propane tank looked into.  Based on 
&gt;phone and personal conveyance of that I brought and left the vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;I asked for a dometic estimate and (naturally) could not be told one 
&gt;until it was pulled out and looked at.  They test and soaped it up and 
&gt;found no leak.  They did lubricate a reset button just outside of the 
&gt;fill valvue.  Good work, no problem here.
&gt;
&gt;Well a _good_  and _thorough_ cleaning was what it took to fix the 
&gt;propane dometic and I picked up the unit today and I was presented with a 
&gt;bill for $380!  No parts were included.
&gt;
&gt;This represents 8 hours at $45 per hour.  They never called me with an 
&gt;estimate and never in my wildest dreams did I think it would get this 
&gt;high without any phone call or any parts.  Seems like he put on the 
&gt;blinders, fixed it and billed me without any regard for my wallet. I 
&gt;would not have had him go beyond $200 though I did not tell him that.  I 
&gt;cannot imagine ever valuing this refrigerator on propane to the tune of 
&gt;over $300.  I was told that $380 was typical for this work after it was 
&gt;done but never beforehand.
&gt;
&gt;I would like some list opinions on this mechanics bill and lack of any 
&gt;estimate (as a matter of fact he never, ever called me in the four days 
&gt;he had my daily driver).  

I think you're being screwed.  For $380 you could get an entirely new
fridge, and any honest mechanic wouldn't work for 8 hours without giving
you an estimate.  You probably should contact your state government fraud
division.

Since you asked for an estimate, they should not have done any work without
first giving you the estimate.  You should not have to pay.
