Subject:      NOS Beetle

I just spotted a  '79 convertible Beetle in a shop. It has been in storage
since 1981 and it has 800 actual miles. The car is immaculate, except for
some dust, it even has the new car smell. It is in the shop to get it running
to be sold. It is getting a new gas tank, I guess letting gas sit for 17
years has taken its toll. It is black on black on black and is fuel injected.
The owner bought it in '79 to keep for later sale, waiting for the market to
peak, but I think the thought of the re-introduction of the Beetle is making
him nervous. If anyone is interested I will try to get the owner's ph.
number. I don't think  he is going to let it go cheap.
