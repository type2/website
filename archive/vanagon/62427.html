Subject: Fridge fan GREAT!!!

If you hav'nt done the modification to add an internal fan to your Dometic 
fridge stop what your doing and do it NOW!. What a difference it makes. I had 
to turn the thermostat down to keep things from freezing. The fridge went from 
45 to 30 after I turned on the internal fan (a hour had passed). This has 
beneficial side effects when the thermostat is turned down like; less propane 
used, less cycling on of the exterior fridge rear cooling fan, less heat in 
the van from fridge etc... 

I took the suggestion fron the vanagon archives document;

The fan addition is VERY simple. Just buy a matchbook size PC cooling fan at 
Radio Shack for about $10. You can steal some power at the fridge 12V 
connector in the cabinet to the right of the fridge. Add a small switch to the 
wire and volia. To mount it I just gently pried open the rightmost two cooling   
fins and squeezed in the fan so no mounting hardware was required. 

Man that beer is cold now...

PS: PS: If you don't feel mechanically inclined you can buy a fridge recirculating 
    fad that runs off two &quot;D&quot; battery cells at Camping World or other RV stores 
    for about $15. It should do somewhat the same thing. Although the small 
    fan blows directly across the cooling fins. Which is why it gets so cold.
