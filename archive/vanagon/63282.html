Subject:      LIST VALUE

As a long time list lurker, can only manage the digest form,  I wanted to
write and thank the list for the help I have received and congratulate it
on the change over.  I recently decided to put in a new longblock in my
tired 1984 Westy.  After installation, actually the second time but that is
another story, it ran but had no power on hills and stumbled on
acceleration.  I decided to change the plugs and found that the old ones
were heavily carboned and fouled.  Ah ha, I read something about that,  I
disconnected the O2 sensor and sure enough ran great.  I bought an new
generic Bosch sensor and installed it.  The same symptoms appeared, no
power on hills.  Disconnect the new sensor and everything was fine again.
Ah ha, I also read about this,  check the coaxial cable and sure enough it
was shorting out the O2 sensor.  After trimming back the shielded wire it
works fine.  I still have the feeling that it did run slightly better with
the sensor disconnected but perhaps that is the price of cleaner air.  I
still have no idea what happen to the coaxial cable to cause the short
since the only thing I did was to disconnect it.  In any case, the point of
the message was to thank the list for making what otherwise would have been
a complete mystery, solvable.
