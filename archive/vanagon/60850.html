Well after absolutely No Response to my offer to sell the beloved Wally my
84 plain camper, I can no longer ask the owner's of Wally's almost
replacement to hold it any longer AND I will also offer it to the list.
Orig owner (now 88) can't really drive it. 76K only work new clutch and
muffler, no air, has the extra two passenger middle seat, Brown with tan
top, all manuals and tables. 4 speed w/PS. This was their third camperbus.
No rust or body damage, none. Asking $5000. Here in Augusta GA. Family name
