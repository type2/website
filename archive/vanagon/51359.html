Subject: '79 ac - interior metal 'supports'
Date: Wed, 6 Nov 1996 07:38:29 -0500

I've noticed that on my 'new' 79's ac, the interior plastic vent and blower
assembly mounted on the roof has metal &quot;supports&quot; over the plastic where it
is mounted. The same system on my '83.5 wasserboxer does not have these
metal supports and the plastic is cracked severely. Obviously, the '79
doesn't have any cracks due to these metal mounts. Does anyone know if
these metal &quot;supports&quot; are stock for the '79 or aftermarket? Are they
available anywhere for the vanagon? It looks like the supports from the '79
may fit the vanagon. Does anyone have a 'parter' with these supports they'd
like to sell?
