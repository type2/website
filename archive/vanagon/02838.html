&gt;Hey there!
&gt;
&gt;I'm keen on borrowing my buddy's '71 camper for some travelling in a couple
&gt;of weeks, but we're both concerned about a wierd problem that it's having.
&gt;He was having some bad tread wear on the left front tire, so he took it in
&gt;to the shop to have an alignment done.  Turns out the ball joints are shot,
&gt;so they put in new ones all the way around and new Continental tires up
&gt;front.  Off he goes on a trip.  Well, the steering is screwy now.  The
&gt;steering wheel won't return and the bus feels strange in the turn, like
&gt;it's slow to start turning, then wants to turn &quot;extra&quot; in the turn, then
&gt;the wheel won't come back.  This wasn't happening before, in fact the bus
&gt;was tracking straight and turning fine.  So he's going to take it back to
&gt;the shop that did the work (a VW shop) but they've already told him that
&gt;&quot;it sounds like the steering box.&quot;  I know these are expensive buggers and
&gt;my buddy doesn't want to be had.  He's already done the external adjustment
&gt;(the screw thingy) on the outside of the steering box, and that didn't fix
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;Could new ball joints all around cause a new problem with the steering box?
&gt;What else could cause this kind of behavior?  Does he need to do the shim
&gt;adjustment to the steering box?  Anyone done this?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!
&gt;Bill
&gt;
&gt;(could someone forward this to the vanagon/bus list for me?  I don't
&gt;subscribe to that one.  Thanks!)
