Subject:      Re: Yokohama Y370D 195/75 R14

On the tire story...I went to purchase a new set of tires today.  Called up
the trusty folks at Tire Rack.  The Y370 is still available from Yokohama.
 While Tire Rack did not have them in stock, they could directly order them
from Yokohoma.  However....they did not recommend them for anything other
than &quot;on-road&quot; usage.  I ended up going with the Bridgestone 603V, another
&quot;D&quot; load tire, ~1700lbs/tire, 65 psi max.  At $300 for the set delivered
($66/tire)...a real deal...I hope.  I'll report back and let all know how
they are doing.

Other tires that will fit the Vanagon that I got data on:

Goodyear Wrangler HT
1708lbs/tire
$88/tire at Tire Rack

Goodyear Wrangler Aquatred
1412lbs/tire
$69/tire

Yokohama Y356
1710lbs/tire
$58/tire at Tire Rack
 - highway rib design.

Yokohama SD-05 Super DIgger V
1435lbs/tire, 50 psi max
$71/tire at Tire Rack
- Yokohama recommends these but admits that these are too weak for a
Westie.

BTW...the GVW on a 84 Westie is 5160lbs.  I figure that you need to allow
at least an additional 1000lbs of margin for people, gear, water, etc.
 This means that nothing under 1540lbs/tire will cut the mustard.  As a
reference point, the Bridgestone RoadTamer SF-475 tires (rated at
1433lbs/tire) are the worst pieces of sh*t that I have ever bought.  They
are pretty much shot after about 18 months.  You can push the car back and
forth about 1/2&quot; on the side walls alone.

Like I said...I'll report back in a couple of months and let the world know
how the new tires are.  BTW..the owner of Tire Rack drives a Vanagon
FWIW....

&gt;&gt;I have seen it said in the thread lately that these tires are no longer
&gt;&gt;being manufactured.  Today I had a new set put on my 91 Westy at $72 a
&gt;&gt;tire.  SO...unless these are old stock (look brand new), they ARE being
&gt;&gt;manufactured, and I hope they are as good as everyone says they are.
&gt;&gt;Here's what I know about them:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yokohama Y370D 195/75 R14
&gt;&gt;8 ply side walls
&gt;&gt;Load range &quot;d&quot;
&gt;&gt;40k mileage warranty
&gt;&gt;Vanagon_dot_com says 45 psi front and 52 psi rear is recommended.  Anyone
&gt;&gt;have any thoughts as too whether or not this is a good pressure?  I
&gt;&gt;think the tire place left at around 35 psi.  (The tires have a max psi
&gt;&gt;of 61, I think)
