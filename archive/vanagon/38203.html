When the Pioneer is cold something in the front just squeaks like 
crazy when you hit bumps.  It sounds like it is coming from the 
middle of the front (so I discount the shocks doing it).  Do I have a 
cricket colony in my heater tubes? :)

Would those rubber busings be the culprate.  Should I get out the 
Grease and squirt it all over them?

When did you last give her a lube job?   Jack her up and squirt grease in the
torsion tube, wing lever, tie rods and king pins.  I think there are abot 23
grease points on an early bus so get pumping!

Hows yr steering?  Play in the tie rods?  Drag link?  up down movement at the
swing lever?  Play in the king pins?

I friend brough his bus round thinking he had some squeek in his brakes, but
he ended up getting his king pins replaced.  The grease guys dont look for
grease points there.
