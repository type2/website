Subject: Re: Lifespan, the next level??

&gt;When our initial survey is complete, the next task seems to be to try to 
&gt;isolate some of the factors that contribute to longevity or lack 
&gt;thereof.

Well, I'm not sure if this is relevant, but my '87 VW Golf is still running
strong (with good compression according to my mechanic) at 155,000 miles.  I
give credit to Mobil 1 synthetic oil changed every 10,000 miles.

(And I've ridden this buggy rough.  Several times across the country,
including one trip from Boston -&gt; Hot Springs, South Dakota, stopping only
for gas!)
