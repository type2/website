 &gt; As I cut, gas started coming out and I turned
 &gt; to avoid getting it in my eyes.  It went into my ear instead. Man did this
 &gt; hurt.  Massive ear ache for about 2 hrs.  I used a diluted solution of 
 &gt; hand cleaner/distilled water to flush it out. Its been two days and I've
 &gt; been wandering around south Boston.  Just kidding, careful with the GAS!


Woof!  That can be VERY VERY bad.  Remember, Claudius killed Hamlet's dad by 
pouring poison in his ear[1] and it ain't just fiction; you can get bad stuff 
in your blood stream this way.

Be careful out there.

[1] Hamlet, Act 1 Scene V:

Ghost:           Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, 
                 My custom always of the afternoon, 
                 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, 
                 With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, 
                 And in the porches of my ears did pour 
                 The leperous distilment; whose effect 
                 Holds such an enmity with blood of man 
                 That swift as quicksilver it courses through 
                 The natural gates and alleys of the body, 
                 And with a sudden vigour doth posset 
                 And curd, like eager droppings into milk, 
                 The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; 
                 And a most instant tetter bark'd about, 
                 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, 
                 All my smooth body. 
                 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand 
                 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
