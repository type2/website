So Joel Walker says:
&gt;
&gt; cause i did it to myself on my 88 bus. :(    $1200 for junkyard wiring
&gt; harness, brain, etc. the whole rear fuel injection control system.

YOWCH!!!  $1200.  Man you got boned but good.  :(
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; seriously, ALL vanagons: when you put the air filter box back, either get
&gt; some little cable ties and get those injector wires out of the way ... tie
&gt; them (with some slack, so the engine can wiggle back and forth) under the
&gt; shelf ... or make damn sure you didn't pinch them.
&gt;
&gt; it's a careless mistake, but it happens. :(
&gt; joel
&gt; ol' sadder but wiser
&gt;

I seriously think we vanagon owners should each send a $10 - $25 check to Joel 
for this one.  I think he really paid the price.  A small donation from us
for some excellent words of wisdom.
