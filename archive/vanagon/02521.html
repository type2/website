Subject: Vangon Fan Housing


Has anyone  out there had any experience in removing an air cooled Vanagon 
fan housing 
with the engine  in the vehicle? I have had experience installing the 
engine and all its components so am relatively familiar with the 
attachment points and labour involved. My concern is not having to drop the 
engine to remove/examine the oil cooler. Presumeably the fan housing must 
also be removed to get at the cooler. 

The engine has an aux oil cooler with 
electric fan but oil pressure will not exceed 30 psi at speed when hot 
(air temp 78 F). This was 
even lower without the aux cooler. The  pump and main bearings check out ok
(75 psi at startup) so I am left with the possibility that the oil cooler is 
blocked.- do they &quot;wear out&quot; like radiators?... The filter is mounted on a 
remote adapter so this may also create some problems. JCW says that 
special oil bypass valves are necessary when using remotely located 
filters....why?

Let me know if you have performed the r/r task and if it is a) impossible, 
b) possible with some difficulty or c) not difficult but time consuming.

Thanks in advance - 
PS I am thinking of installing  a grooved oil bypass relief valve and an 
oil pressure adjuster to boost pressure  if the oil cooler is not the 
problem- any ideas/experience?


Thanks in advance....DC
