        2.  heater.  This isn't the first vw I've owned; that said, I know

Umm, you do mean a gas heater, right?  Assuming that to be so, and this
being an area in which I've gained a distressing amount of experience, you
need to check the business end of the heater, under the Bus (under the
shield).  It may just (just! Ha!) be the igniter, a little electric gizmo
which costs.  Also, is the fuel line intact to the heater?  I've seem some
that, for whatever reason, were clipped &amp; crimped.  It might be worth while
seeing if you can find somebody who works on these in your area if the
trouble isn't immediately obvious.  I'm always paranoid about a fire
stemming from a screwed-up heater.
