Subject:      1.9L Turbo Diesel Westy

Well, it's official... I now have a running, snorting, seething 1.9L TD in
the Westy that works. After returning the tranny back to the rebuilder ( I.
T. S., El Cajon, Ca.) and having the Lock-Rite locking differential
removed. then reinstalling it, I got to drive it for the first time just a
few minutes ago...The results blew me away. I now have a rocket ship. I
wasn't able to open it up all the way due to traffic but cruising at 75mph,
I still had peddle left, going uphill... I'm going to have to put larger
tires on it. For those of you who don't drive a diesel Westy, anything over
60 mph is cause for celebration. That van has never seen 70 much less 75.
One thing I'm going to do is put tires with  stiffer sidewalls on. Not
having attained those lofty speeds before, the XZX's that are on there
seemed fine. With the new top end, I'm going to have to rethink the tire
setup.  Anyone know offhand what the largest tires fit a stock setup
without rubbing or bottoming out? I'm sure it's in the archives somewhere
but right now I'm a little to excited to look.
