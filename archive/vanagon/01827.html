&gt; A dealer told me that VW was not going to distribute the Westfalia
&gt; version of the full camper in the states because it would cost 35-40K.
&gt; The story then was that Winnebago was going to do a pop-top model.
&gt; But it sounds now like the VW distributed model is made by Westfalia.
&gt; Is that true?  Does anyone know what they are asking for this??

&gt;From the VW EuroVan Camper brochure:
&quot;The conversion-ready EuroVan is built in Hannover, Germany, and its
transition to a fully-equipped camper is completed in Forest City, Iowa by
Winnebago Industries.&quot;
Volkswagen starts with an extended wheelbase EuroVan to give the new
Camper more interior volume than its predecessors....blah, blah&quot;
