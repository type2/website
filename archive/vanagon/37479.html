&gt;Breaks up the low-frequency sounds (&quot;exhaust rumble&quot;) and turns them
&gt;into high-frequency sounds (&quot;chirp!&quot;), which are then better filtered out
&gt;by the car's insulation. Chirping cars are quieter inside!

It would follow that cars that do not go &quot;chirp,&quot; but instead go &quot;blap,&quot;
like mine does, are quieter *outside*. (!) This is not the case. I know it.
My neighbors know it. Idle passers-by know it.

Maybe we all have inadequate insulation. ;)
