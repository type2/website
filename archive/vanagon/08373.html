&gt; 
&gt; About roof racks for the vanagon-
&gt;   in my experience hauling kids canoes bikes and kayaks...
&gt; the famous &quot;quick and easy&quot; brackets are still the best strongest
&gt; and cheapest . they are under 30$ and you use fir 2x4's
&gt; or hardwood 2x2's for the crossbars-its really easy!
&gt;   tips:
&gt;  spray paint them bright colors,
&gt;   if your canoe has wood gunnnels cover the rear one with indoor outdoor
&gt;     carpet.
&gt;   for bikes, the thule bike racks can be bolted to them easily, for
&gt;     bikes and canoes it's helpful to have a 3rd crossbar. i have always found
&gt; the bikerack [from rhode gear i recall] that sits on the rear hatch door
&gt; to be the bast solution,it's also cheap.
&gt;     loading- if you have a canoe put your rear rack as far back as possible ,
&gt; just rest the bow on it and push it forward onto the rack.
&gt;     remember to tie down those bow and stern lines!
&gt; 
&gt;  that's my experience for what it's worth!
