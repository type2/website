Subject: eurovan/winnebago

&gt;
&gt;I've hear lots of bad and a little good about the Eurovan.
&gt;

You must have been reading old issues of Consumer Reports or something.
I'm certainly pretty happy with mine so far.

&gt;But... I am looking for something between an RV and a Conversion Van so that
&gt;I can travel in some comfort and not have to stay at motels and eat at
&gt;restaurants all the time.  About the only vehicle that I know about that
&gt;fills this requirement is the VW EuroVan camper.  I was talking to a dealer
&gt;yesterday who mentioned the marriage of Winnebago and VW in the latest
&gt;camper incarnation.  Does anyone know anything about these puppies.  Like:
&gt;how long have they been made?  are they any good?  cost?  availability of
&gt;used ones?  should I buy new if I can afford it??  If they used to be lousy,
&gt;are they better now?  etc., etc.?
&gt;

To attempt answering your questions:
They were made in  1995, carried over into 1996.
Yes, they're &quot;any good&quot;. Basically a Westfalia-like design.
Cost is high, MSRP is about $32K, street price is $27-$28K.
There are not many used ones, I've heard total # manufactured around 5000+.
I recently heard of a used one in Idaho, it was selling for $28K too.
There have been some reports here of problems with the '93 EV, notably
&quot;piston slap&quot; which has been covered by the warranty. I don't know if these
apply to
the '95 model - they do have the same engine though.
Eventually, VW is supposed to be bringing EVs with the VR6 engine in, but
no one seems to know if/when they'll do that to the Camper model. Nor how
much more it will cost.


&gt;I am especially concerned about their reliability, as this has been a huge
&gt;question about the Eurovans.
&gt;

Hard to say: the '93s haven't been especially troublesome. There's rather
a small sample to determine anything from here though. I've seen lots of them
in the Seattle area lately. You know how VWs are though: even if you have
trouble with it, you still love it.
The '95s are still pretty new and low mileage: we'll have to wait awhile and
see what breaks. They are pretty much the same vehicle though: the Camper is
just the extended wheelbase model of the EV.

&gt;I really need some help here, so any and all advice on the specific question
&gt;of the VW/Winnebago vehicle or potential solutions to the general question
&gt;of what is a good vehicle to buy for &quot;camping&quot; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;

A lot of people are happy with trucks with campers on the back.
Certainly cheaper. The EV is a lot better in a cross-wind I'll bet though!
I've seen a Canadian (Vancouver/Victoria) company which does camper
conversions of more common vans. I don't know what they cost though.

If the UPS.EDU you're at is Univ of Puget Sound, you might check out:
Carter VW in Seattle, and whatever the dealer is in Everett.
