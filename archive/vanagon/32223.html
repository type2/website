Pop tops that hinge at the front do have a cool kind of look, but there 
are a couple of problems you should know about:

The &quot;upstairs&quot; bunk is only a single-person cot, whereas later westies 
(75(?) on?) have pop tops that hinge at the rear and have a full double 
bunk up top.

Many people report problems with lifting or rattling of the pop-top while 
driving, especially at highway speeds.  A number of fixes for this have 
been described on the list, with varying success and degrees of 
difficulty, so you may want to search the archives for this.  Rear-hinged 
pop-tops do not appear to have this problem.

It may be easier to mount and remove heavy cargo from the roof luggage 
carrier area on rear-hinged pop-tops since you can stand on the front 
door sills to stand up high for tying things down, etc.  I don't know if 
it's quite so easy to do on front-hinged pop-tops, where the luggage 
carrier is at the rear.  (I know we shouldn't be putting 400 lbs on the 
roof, but even a 6 gallon gas can is plenty heavy in my books).
