So nathan lebron says:
&gt; I've come to the conclusion that the best way to save money with this van is 
&gt; do everything myself.  I have been somewhat hesitant since I have never 
&gt; done major work on any kind of car, except for replacing bulbs, oil 
&gt; changes and an alternator adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt; My baby now needs to have some brake work done and I need some 
&gt; assistantce.  Can anybody give me a cyber-hand?  Thanx

Brake jobs are about the easiest jobs to do on most cars. 

This job is covered in the Bentley Manual, the 'Idiot Guide' as well as the
other aftermarket books like Clymer &amp; Haynes.  It's pretty straight forward
and they all have diagrams that you can easily follow.
