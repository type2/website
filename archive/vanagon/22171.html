Subject:      bus for sale: 82 diesel

i saw this one in Centreville, AL on the way back home today:

1982 Vanagon Diesel,
     Dark Brown (below), Light Tan (on top), brown vinyl interior.
     110,237 miles,
     $1,650   (205) 926-6554

&lt;my observations:&gt;
tires look ok, about half-tread left;
body in excellent shape: no dings or scrapes or repairs that i could see
                         anyway; original paint;
upholstery looks very good (if you like brown);

only funny thing was this big wire that was holding up the muffler. :)

if anybody is seriously considering it, i'll go back and drive it if you want
... it's about 30 miles from me.
