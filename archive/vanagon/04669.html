&gt;I've always found it humorous that with the thousands of things that can
&gt;go wrong with a car that will put it out of commission, we carry spare
&gt;tires.  I don't get it.  I've put on hundreds of thousands of miles in my
&gt;life, and I've NEVER had a flat tire on the road.  It just makes me
&gt;chuckle.

especially since the 'new' cars all seem to want to save 'weight' and have
those Weenie-Wheels as spares. :)   but we must have more crap on the roads,
cause i've had flats over the years ... never on the highways, though ...
always around town (nails, screws, etc.).

but i can still remember (oh, shit ... here he goes again!) back in the old
days, when we would drive 200 miles to florida, and every single time, we'd
have a flat tire. every time. never fail. of course, tires back then only
cost about $10 new, but they lasted maybe 12,000 miles if you were lucky.

but if i go to alaska (yeah, right: one of these days ...) i'm damn sure
gonna take me about THREE spare tires!!! and a couple of gas cans full of
fuel, too!! :)
