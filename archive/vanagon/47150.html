&gt;Actually, I received $700 for the '79.....on sale just in time for 
&gt;summer.

It's sitting in my driveway here in Pa.  Turned out to have 
virtually no compression in 3 cylinders.  I'd like to tear the 
motor apart just out of curiosity - didn't see or hear anything 
obvious to explain the problem (no thrown rod, etc.).  

Just put a motor in it last week but haven't got it running yet.  
It's got a very nice interior, needs a little rust work (in 
particular, I'd like to find a nice sliding door for it) but
worth putting the effort into. 

With any luck, this bus will live again real soon!
Ron
