So Ben Orlock says:
&gt; My question is---am I being too ambitious, biting off more than I can chew?
&gt; Or is the procedure really as uncomplicated as Muir's book paints it out to
&gt; be?

I say go for it!   Your time/money situation clearly dictates that you should
, at least, tear into the engine and see what kind of shape it's in and
determine via Muir and Bentley (if you can afford it) whether it is worth
a rebuild or not.  Take your time and as the Idiot guide suggests, mark
and tag everything as you dismantle so that you know how it goes back 
together.   You should have no problem with taking it out and apart and
be sure to heed the cautions in the book(s).

&gt; 
&gt; Also, could anyone tell me a good place to acquire the necessary Phase II
&gt; tools?  Would these be available at any good hardware store or auto supply
&gt; store, or is it going to require a ittle more searching than that.
&gt; 

As a novice, I recommending just getting the cheapest sockett set and
wrenches, screw drivers etc. you can get.  I say this because ya never
now whether or not you are going to like doing mechanical things.  And
it makes no sense spending booko-bucks on premium tools until you know
it is worth the expense.  Besides, you can't afford them yet and the 
cheaper tools will do fine for a while.  I know, I still use some of
mine. ;p   I'd just go to a Kragen Auto Supply or similar and price
the parts with other places and get the cheapest set.

Enjoy the challenge!
