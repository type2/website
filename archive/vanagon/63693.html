Subject: Return or an old problem

Short story... Earlier this year my 82 westy (FI no O2 sensor) began to
run very rich, smoking and losing power.  Checked all the FI parts
(injectors, temp sensors, vacuum leaks etc.) even tried replacing the
AFM.  No Luck.  Got to the point I was trying to sell it.  Finally, I
cleaned the connector to the ECU and the damn thing started and ran
great for a week.  I should add that the battery had completely
discharged.  After a week, the same problem reoccured.

Two questions:

1.  Just before this all started, I put a set of splitfire sparkplugs in
it.  Wrong? or what.

2.  Is there any way to check the ECU without taking it to the dealer?

I throw myself on the mercy of the list.
