Subject: Weird Golf

&gt;&gt;&gt;While travelling around the roads in near Lake Donner yesterday, I happened
upon this bright metallic green Golf with a spare tire on the back (on one
of those swing out racks that most SUVs carry the spare on). Up front it had
a brush bar with headlight protectors... The tires looked quite large; it
diffiently rode much higher than my own Golf.... Looked pretty new
and very snazzy... Oh, and it had this little badge on the back which read:
syncro

Dave,

It looks as though you had a Golf &quot;Country&quot; sighting.  These were Syncro beasts, about
4&quot; higher, Very big tires, external spare... Just as you described.  I have pictures from my
last trip to Germany including the fascinating underpinnings.  I was very impressed.
