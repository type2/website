Subject: Help Help 009 Distributor?

Hi,

I'm subscribed to the list at work, but not on my home account, and I need
a question answered as quickly as possible(I need to get my bus goin
today).  If you could email me an answer( sequoia_at_halcyon_dot_com),  I would
greatly appreciate it.

The question:  The distributor in my '70 bus is fried.  This is the
distributor with the vacuum advance.  These things are not made any more,
some companies re-manufacture them, but the people I've talked to say that
they are of poor quality.  I have also heard bad things about putting a 009
distributor on a bus.  I can't remember the reason why, but it was to the
effect that it would fry the engine.  So, have any of you run into this
problem, and what did you do? (Do I put a 009 on it?)  Or do I hunt down
the other distributor at a higher cost?

I'm looking for someone to say &quot;I've got a 009 on my bus, and it's been
fine for X years =)

Thanks for any help, I'll be sitting here waiting for replies.
