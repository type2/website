What do you all think about going out for beer/food in the evening on
Thursday, May 25? There are some fine bars &amp; restaurants in my
neighborhood. Afterwards we can all caravan to the BBTA campground, 25
minutes away.

If you arrive into town late, you could still call in for directions. I'll
bring the cellular phone with me: (314) 740-2217. Lemme know what your
plans are. --  Sami
