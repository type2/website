Subject: Re: ignition wires

Funny, I just bought a new set of Bosch, even though I have a fairly good
set of wires on the beast now.  The Bosch were not much more expensive (I
paid $25 for them vs. $20 for the aftermarket versions).  I doubt there is
much difference.  The reason for the purchase was that the little caps on
the sparkplugs kept getting loose.  The aftermarket wires used these, but
the original Bosch wires do not.

Actually, though, I really much prefer the wires on the later waterboxers.
Does anybody know if you can just change the distributor cap and use the
(very expensive, but beautiful) waterboxer wires on a airboxer?  Even if they
need those little screwcaps on the sparkplugs (^;

The aftermarket waterboxer wires I have bought all had Bosch brand ends on
them.
