Subject:       Weekend Plans/No Poopie

Ok, since we're on the environmental kick.

If anyone is in Moab this weekend, look out for me.  

We'll be doing our part to damage nature while biking!

Just kidding of course.  

Since we're sharing our environmental views, I need to give my two-
cents worth:

For anyone camping in the desert, DO NOT TAKE A CRAP AND BURY IT IN 
THE SAND!

Unfortunately your little treat will be around for years.  Anyone 
familiar with camping at lakes like Lake Powell, or Mead has probably 
had the unlucky experience of finding waste on the beach, as the 
water falls and rises over the course of a year.

Ok.  That's enough from me.

Oh yeah another thing: 

So help me if I ever find out any of you are the kind of losers that 
throw their lit cigarette butts out the window while driving on the 
highway, so help me...  I've been hit one too many times by flying 
cigarette butts sparking their way across my hood.

P.S.  For all concerned, we are very cautious whilst biking in 
environmentally sensitive areas (such as the desert).  Riding off 
marked trails can cause much damage to wild plants.
