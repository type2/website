Subject: coolant leak up front

Howdy All,
        I've got a coolant leak that only occurs when I use the
heater/defroster. The general area of the leak is front passenger side. I
crawled underneath with a flashlight but couldn't find the leak source. I
assume the leak originates at the heater core or its hose connections. So
what is the best way to get up in there? Do you need to remove the dash?
        Any info is appreciated (my Bentley is en route)

Pat
