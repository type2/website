Myles queries:
&gt;  I do have a couple of Q's for the list since I am a virgin at working on 
&gt; the fuel injection system in these buses.
 &gt;  1) What is the best book to get to find out how to work on the FI?

I can wholeheartedly reccommend 2 FI injection books.  BOTH are 
excellent and you need BOTH if you are to become a true FI 
afficiando.

&quot;Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; by Charles Probst  AND
&quot;How to Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection&quot; by Ben Watson

If I were to buy just one which would I buy?  Well, the one by Watson 
is more 'how to' and Probst is more 'theory', which,  if you learn, 
enables you to 'how to' better than most.  You choose.



&gt;  I enjoy reading all that goes on on the VANAGON list, even though my 
&gt; wife thinks I waste too much time at the computer

Ahhh.  If she thinks you waste too much time at the computer, wait 
'til you start working on your van ;-)
