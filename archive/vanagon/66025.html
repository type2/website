Subject:      All CA '91s really '90s?

Oh wise ones,

Someone recently told me that due to a law in California in 1991 which
required all catalytic converters on new vehicles to have something called
a constant monitoring device (?), all Vanagons sold in California
in 1991 were really '90s (or identified as such), since VW knew they
were phasing them out and didn't want to bother with the change.

Any truth to this?

Also, I thought i read somewhere that power windows &amp; locks were standard
on '90s &amp; '91s, but i've found one that does not have them...what gives?

thanks

stephen
