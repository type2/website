regarding charles' post on frozen brake drums


you warm weather guys/gals might not appreciate that for a good three
months in the heart of winter one never uses your parking brake unless
you are forced to park on a hill or the like -one can wait as long as 
thirty days between temps above freezing, so if you manage to freeze
your brake on you can look forward to a tripunderneath the beast, invariably
in six inches of slush.

on a related topic i have yet to find a good lock lubricant that is
effective at -25 to -30 below - we dont dare lock our car doors
during these spells - happily crime is not permitted during the
cold snaps.
