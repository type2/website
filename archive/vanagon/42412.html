&gt;Subject says it all.  Anyone ever rebuilt one of these and had it work!?  
&gt;Dealer says they've failed several times, FLAPS says no go, usually hidden 
&gt;machining work required that the rebuild kit won't fix. Prices are $420Cdn 
&gt;($300US) for a FLAPS rebuild (using my core if desired), with lifetime 
&gt;warranty. VW say $1060 hah hah hah, they have a $100 seal kit, hence my 
&gt;dilema, do I waste the $100, then buy the $420 rebuild......  The rack 
&gt;failed fast, seems like a seal blew, rather than wearout.  Any advice on 
&gt;this would be appreciated, like if they really can be rebuilt, or if I can 
&gt;pull a rack out of an Audi 5000 say?   Tim

Take it apart.  If in perfect mechanical condition, buy the seal kit.  If
not, buy the rebuilt rack.
