Subject: 80 - 83? GAS TANK REPAIRS [longish


Stephen White wrote&lt;spw_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;
My gas tank has a 1/4&quot; by 1/8&quot; hole under where the heater tube runs.  It=

seems to be in good shape otherwise.
My _plan_ is to fiberglass the outside of the hole for structural rigidit=
y
and then to slosh the inside of the tank with sealer to keep the gasoline=

from eating through my patch. Is this a feasable plan?
If not, What can i expect to pay for a rust-free used tank, or even
better, what can i expect to pay a professional welder to fix my little
hole?
--------------------------------
Hi Vanagoners,
In response to the above gas tank query  I had a similar problem when I
bought my 82 westy.  I had major rust in the same spot which is common.  =
I
first went to a radiator shop to see about repair.  They could do it but
said no guarantee, it could last 30 days or a year.  =


I ended up searching the junkyards for a replacement here in Salt Lake
City, Ut.  I found a few.   The cheapest was 60 bucks but were  bent and
crushed or had holes.  The last one I found was from the rip off place he=
re
called Allsmall.  They have lots of Vanagons and buses but charge about 1=
/2
of new cost.  I ended up paying out the nose/butt  ($225) for the Allsmal=
l
used one.  AVOID THAT PLACE EXCEPT LAST RESORT.

It has worked for 3 years.  I posted a while back that I have gone throug=
h
three fuel filters in the past 6 months.  Last month I pulled the tank to=

inspect and repair.  I did not see any rust inside.  Cutting open the use=
d
filter showed lots of rust.  On the Vanagon tank there is a lower section=

of the tank where fuel is sucked from. It is sealed from the rest of the
tank except for a very small hole.   Water and gunk also settle here.  It=

is very inaccessible.   Taking it to a repair shop did not help.  They
could not figure out how to clean and seal the lower section.  Also there=

is a plastic hose inside the tank which could be broken or eroded with
acid.  I am fearful of adding the tank sealer as there are a lot of small=

vent tubes on these tanks which could get plugged.  ANYONE DONE THIS WITH=

SUCCESS??

I am still at odds on how to remedy this.  ANY SUGGESTIONS WELCOME.  Whil=
e
the tank is out I decided to check and replace all rubber fuel lines and
rubber seals.  Been doing that for a month now as I keep having to order
seasl and gaskets from VW and wait.   =


 The vapor expansion tanks in the wheel wells had very bad seals.  One ha=
d
no seal at all as the fuel vapors had eaten the rubber gasket turning it =
to
silly putty.  Dirt griome and water was entering the system this way. =

CHECK THOSE EXPANSION TANK SEALS!!!!!  Vapors eat them for dinner.  I am
currently waiting for these seals which were $7.50 each from VW. (yikes)

 Also I could not find the big fuel line (7/16 or 1/2 inch) which connect=
s
to the filler tube.  I spent most of last saturday searching everywhere f=
or
this line.  VW was the only place in town with this hose.    When they sa=
id
is was $10.14 per foot ( not 1.014 but 10.14)  all I could do was burst o=
ut
laughing.  SO I BENT OVER AND BOUGHT 2 feet.  20 bucks for 2 feet of fuel=

line, sheesh!!!!!  Anyway I will have all new lines and seals so I will b=
e
set for another 10 - 15 years.

I took the gas tank to a high pressure car wash and shot the little high
pressure squirter into the tiny little hole to the lower section of the g=
as
tank. I just kept squirting and chunks of rust kept coming out.  I guess =
I
will reinstall it and change filters 6 times a year if needed, (not the
best option).  Also you know when the filter is plugging as you hear that=

whine of the pump as it struggles to pump throught the clogged filter. =

This was mentioned a day or two ago by a listee who thought his pump was
going out.  CHECK THAT FILTER FIRST, $5 versus $140 - 300.

In the meantime I will look for a another tank..   Hopefully I have remov=
ed
most of the flakable rust at the car wash.  ANYONE KNOW WHERE TO GET ONE =
OF
THOSE BIG GLASS FUEL FILTERS WITH REMOVEABLE ELEMENTS or  A HIGHER CAPACI=
TY
FILTER??

One other option the gas tank repair guy suggested was to clamp and weld
off the old fuel out line and install a new one above the lower section s=
o
it wopuld not suck up the rust.   I do not like this idea as then water
would collect in there and never be removed causing more rust.  =


Sorry this has been so long and rambleous but it has consumed my life the=

last month and  continues.  That about all I know.  If anyone made it thi=
s
far and has suggestion on a better fix, I would love to hear about it.

Have a great day.
