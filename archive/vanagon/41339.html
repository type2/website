&gt;Actually, we are talking about replacing the nut aren't we? The bolt is a 
&gt;stud with a cap nut, at least in the drawings in Bentley. From what I can 
&gt;tell by reading the manual, there is no need to seal the stud, just the cap 
&gt;nut. And is there need to use a new nut or can the old one be cleaned, 
&gt;sealed, and reinstalled?

Yes, I'm referring to the nut.  I would recomend repalcing it as the face can
get pitted also.  BTW, nuts should allways be repalced in critical
applications.  Small cost to ensure constant clamp load at the head.
