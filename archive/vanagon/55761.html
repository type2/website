Subject: Re: Needed - EV Oil Filters

Try:

Paul Walser Volkswagen
Phoenix, Az 85016
800-876-5199
fax: 602-265-8768

I first got their number through the list about two years ago. I've been
ordering from them ever since and their prices and service are unbeatable.
Mention the internet and they give you an additional discount. When I say
they cost less, I mean THEY COST A LOT LESS! Original VW parts for about 25
- 30% less on average than what I could get them for locally.

I can't remember if they've changed the name of the dealership or not. (If
they have, it's still the same people, only a different name.) Check them
out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

&gt;My dear friends (particularly you EVers):
&gt;
&gt;Some time ago (about two years, I think) there was some traffic about
&gt;getting oil filters for the Eurovan in bulk or from some source (mail
&gt;oreer) OTHER than a VW($) dealer and saving a few bucks.
&gt;
&gt;I've searched my old message traffic and can't find anything like that.
&gt;
&gt;Now that I'm in a place the dealers love to have us, I'm getting
&gt;&quot;everything BUT the grease&quot; when I need to do an oil change.
&gt;
&gt;In my locale (Saint Louis or Joplin, MO are the nearest dealers - both
&gt;100+ miles away) the Eurovan oil filter is still listed as a 'dealer
&gt;only' item, and it costs BIG bucks!
&gt;
&gt;Got any informationj on a source for Eurovan filters (name, phone,
&gt;addresss) that you can pass to me?
