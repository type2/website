Subject: [F]  Eurovans owners shown as litterbugs

Last night while watching tv I saw a commercial shown by the cable company
which often cut in showing local and state commercials.  There was one from
the state of Georgia showing how clean the state is, what we must do, 
blah, blah, blah...

At the end of the commercial is a family in a Eurovan driving down the road
dumping their trash out the window.  I was surprised to see one on a
commercial.  I hope that it does not portray us as bad people.
