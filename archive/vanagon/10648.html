&gt;  I've heard that noisy CV joints can sometimes be cured by injecting grease
&gt;  into them using one of those giant &quot;syringe needles&quot; attached to a grease 
&gt;  gun. This avoids taking the axles off and getting dirty &lt;not that we mind,
&gt;  right?&gt;. Does anyone have an opinion on swapping the axles from one side
&gt;  to the other so as to run the CV joints in the opposite direction and 
&gt;  move the wear to the ball races on the other side?

Boy that takes a lot of _balls_, injecting such a _race_-ist statement into
the discussion.  But then again, this has no _bearing_ on the subject.
