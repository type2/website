Subject: WESTY FABRIC, THIS JUST IN

OK, people have been writing concerned and all.  Trim shop just
got back to me today and here is the scoop, I have just purchased 54
yards of the stuff, at an increased price of $10.99 driven by
the &quot;competitive bidder&quot; if indeed they existed, as some suggested
the Trim Shop may have been jerking my chain, but so is life.
The thing is this, I have 1 continuous 27 yd roll, and the other
is piece meal, cut from the sounds of the lengths already to fit
a couple of buses, so as it stands I feel I have enough for everyone
who had to this point asked for it, I will get around to mailing
you confirmations tomorrow, and begin discussing terms of payment.
Except for rare circumstances like Canadiams, it is safest for all
of us to use UPS COD, and the fee is not too bad.  But I will make
other arrangements if desired, so long as I recieve money order, or
cashiers check payment before shipment, but to be fair like I said
COD is all of our best bet.  When I ask for confirmation I'll let you
suggest your payment strategy, I feel I'm trustworthy but I can't prove
that, however I've been on this list nearly 2 years now and am not going
anywhere.  I also note, I may ration this stuff a bit to cover all those
interested if the need be, hence I'm going to measure carefully and talk
to an upholstery shop so as to get a very exacting idea what we each need.
