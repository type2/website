&gt;This weekend I had the pleasure of working on two different post '71

Typical.  I'm suprised the original metal piece was there at all.  The
marks were originally painted on, and I've seen very few that still
have paint.

&gt;Does anyone make an aftermarket piece to replace the stock one that
&gt;has marks pressed into it?  Does anyone know where 0 degrees is in
&gt;reference to either end of the strip?  If I get lucky enough to find
&gt;one in a junkyard around here are the marks the same for 72-79?

Vee Parts in San Diego sells them for $3.99.  Their phone # is 619-477-4787.
I just bought three of them there two months ago for fellow listmembers, but
as I don't live in San Diego anymore, I can't just go down there and get
more.  :(  They are black plastic, not nearly as nice as the originals, but
they work.  I would be really suprised if the marks were different for any
year from 72-79, as they are the same basic engine.  If someone tells you
one of those years is different, do yourself a favor and get a second
opinion.  My opinion is that 72-79 are the same.
