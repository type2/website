Hey, whoever you are that posted about the '75 FI bus that stalls when
cold, I can give you something to think about.

In the VW fuel injected engine, there is a cold-start valve which
supplies fuel to the intake air when the engine is cold.  This valve is
controlled by the thermo-time switch.  The thermo-time switch cuts off
juice to the cold-start valve when the air around it reaches a
prescribed temp, which is marked on the outside of the thermo-time
switch.  Bentley says that early FI engines had the switch set to cut
off the cold-start valve at 50 degrees F but that that setting caused
problems with starting and cold-running.  Later FI engines were equipped
with thermo-time switches that cut off at 95 degrees F to cure this
problem and those are what's available now for replacement.  You might
want to check that out.  Also, you might want to check the cold-start
valve itself to make sure that it is in fact pumping out fuel when it's
supposed to.  The Bentley book goes through the FI troubleshooting
procedure fairly thoroughly.  Anybody else?
