&gt; Here in San Diego, CA, gasoline has jumped up to $1.50 per gallon
&gt; (that's about 40 cents per litre).  This is an increase of over 20%
&gt; in the last month.  

Its gone up here, to.

I read it was because of the re-formulated, anti-smog they are s'posed
to be producing, but that won't be here until june.

I've also noticed that the bus has run like crap on the last 2 tanks:
one from Beacon (which I usually don't get but I was desparate) and one
from AM/PM-Arco
