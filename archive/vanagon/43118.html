&gt;  &gt; i'm really interested in maybe a VR6 for my crewcab...
&gt; i'd get lots of power and still have heat....
&gt; still looking for more info,though...

&gt;I have been considering installing a late 911 engine in my Westy (I will if
I have any more head troubles). From all that I have read the engines from
the late 80s are very high- mileage, trouble-free motors. I read a magazine
article about a outfit in CA. that offers a kit to insatall one. It seemed
reasonably easy to install but the engines of course are not cheap. I think
the heater problem might be solved by welding up a waterjacket around part
of the muffler and adapting a water pump onto the engine and just run water
heated by the muffler through the existing coolant system. Living in
Washington, the heater is a prime concern.
