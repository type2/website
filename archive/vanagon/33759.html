Subject: bulletproof....

	Not to be pedantic, but 'bulletproof', when used
seriously, always comes with the practical info of which
bullets its proof against. 22 Short? Sure, NATO .308? maybe
Russian 7.62 X 39mm? maybe. .415 Weatherby? Probably not.
30mm depleted uranium GAU-8? No way. 
120mm smoothbore penetrator?? Come on!

	Since *nothing* else on a VW Type 2 is bullet-proof,
for any military cartridge I can think of, its difficult to 
believe bullet-proof tires- that is, sidewalls and tread that
withstand rifle or pistol shots, would be fitted. You COULD
put Kevlar or ceramic armor in the doors, behind the seat, inside
the nose pannel, and a blanket around the gas tank, and 
something for the sides and rear of the engine and tranny...
nothing like that, and certainly no bullet-proof glass, was
visible on the 'NATO' crewcab I saw. And it isn't likely.

	Run-flat tires are a better bet.

	A friend of mine worked a major diesel engine manufacturer
and they sold engines for, among other things, M-113 Armored Personel
Carriers. In addition to the hundreds of horsepower and feet-pounds
of torque normally provided, there was a button or lever which would
disable the governor on the engine. It voided the normal warranty, but
90% of engines delivered were expected to be able to produce 1000+ hp 
for 90 seconds. Some would probably use it to advance, most
would probably save it to retreat as needed!

	The same option was popular for dump-trucks that haul ore out 
of strip-mines. The cost of an engine being small compared to the
expense of having one lane of the two-lane road in and out of
the hole blocked by a broken-down truck. As long as the engine would
run, the drivers are expected to get the truck out of the hole by
any means, fair or foul. Grenaded engines were sometimes boxed up and
sent back to the manufacturer for R&amp;D value or ammuseent, and my
friend saw more than one.

	Bill
