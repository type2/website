I swear...some days you're the windscreen and some days you're the bug.

I sent out the first post about tires and found it got all mangled.
Sent it out again only to find that the mailer sent it out a second
time, this time correctly.  So apologies to anyone who thinks they're
seeing double.  Well actually, you are.  Kind of.

Joachim, going home now to finish off that well-deserved bottle of
hooch.  Or was that what got me into this mess in the first place?
