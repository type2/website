Subject: 86 westy syncro , wires, and locking diff.

 1. I need to find a good set of after market wires for my van. Does any one
have any suggestions.


































                                                                           2.
I also help in diagnosing a locking diff. problem. Is there any manuals or
lit. that may make this easier, my Bentley only breezes over this area .
                                                              Thank you ,
