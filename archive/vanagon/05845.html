Subject: Muir &quot;How to Buy a VW&quot; Question

I'm a Wanabuser, but don't want to be.  I'm not in any particular
hurry so I've been just keeping my eyes open for buses in that
narrow range (given my financial state) between too rusty and
too expensive.  Not much in that niche, here in Michigan.

Anyway, I looked at a '72 camper the other day that actually,
despite oxidized paint, had a body in excellent shape, so the
next visit will be to do the Muir &quot;How to Buy a VW&quot; tests of
various mechanical components.

My question is, he says to check the differential and brakes 
this way:  jack up one side of the car, block the
other wheels, and run the car through all gears (this is on page 25 of
my &quot;15th&quot; edition), is this possible?  Won't the other rear
wheel try to rotate too, with dangerous results?  Has anyone
done this test?

I'm sure to post many other questions later. . . . .

Thanks
