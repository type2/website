Subject: Re: Vanagon Transaxle Oil Change

&gt; Question here.  I want to change the transaxle oil in my '85 Vanagon.  It
&gt; looks impossible to get the drain bolt out due to the exhaust pipes being in
&gt; the way.  My big old allen wrench won't even begin to fit in there.

I recently had this problem with the wrench not being able to fit because
of the pipes.  What I did was to use a rabbit wheel bolt (17mm) with a tall
head and a 17mm wrench.  Worked like a charm.
