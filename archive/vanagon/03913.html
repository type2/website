&gt; Dave, why isn't your bus running? There is a support group for your
&gt; special needs....

Well, in a moment of insanity, I traded my roommate my freshly rebuilt
set of stock carbs for his newly-acquired dual Webers.  To make a
long story short, one of the Webers don't do shit, and I can't find a
rebuild kit for it.  I don't even know what kind of carbs they are.
They have no numbers on them except for &quot;24&quot; on both barrels.  They
appear to be Brazillian made.  I have a Haynes Weber book and it doesn't
have any carbs like these in it.

I may have to pay off my roommate to swap me back for my old carbs.  How
embarrasing...  Before I do that, I will attempt to find out what kind
of carbs these are and fix the right one.  Oh, the mount for the throttle
assembly is in the wrong place and the cable rubs against the firewall.
I will have to remount that too to make them work well.  *sigh*
