Subject: Coolant disappearing
Date: Sun, 17 Dec 1995 00:03:27 GMT

My neighbour has a 1990 Westy (same as mine).  His coolant keeps disappearing.
No leaks on the floor and he could not find any around the engine.  He replaced
the water pump with a new one.  Since then, has lost about a liter more.  Would
appreciate any help.  He is mechanically inclined and does most repairs
himself.  The vehicle has just gone over 100 klicks.
