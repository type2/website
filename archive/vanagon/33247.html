I'm suprised to hear that your the expert on synthetic oil having never used
it.  I won't go into all of the engineering (I'm a mechanical engineer)
reasons why it's better, but I will say this:  A leading synthetic oil maker
(I won't mention the name so it won't be a commercial) meet the SAE oil
requirements for grade SF 2 years before they requirements were official -
with their standard product.  NO changes needed.  I'm certain that no mineral
based oil can claim that.  Would you rather use an oil that meets old SE
standards or one that probably already meets SH standards?
