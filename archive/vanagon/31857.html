I have an '80 Vanagon w/ 4speed manual transmission, and the tranny filler
hole (with same big plug as the draining hole) is hidden above where the
short shift coupler enters the tranny, which is at the front right side of
the transmission (on the right side and towards the front end of the
vehicle). Little hard to get to it, I use a standard 17mm allen key and a
17mm wrench to 'work' that plug.
