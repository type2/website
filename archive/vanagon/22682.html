  Hi Sami,

  As you have experienced personally, there are many Kautzini and when we
  want to take our bikes it requires BOTH a front and rear rack. On the rear
  we use a strap on type that Francesca picked up at Target for 50 bucks. This
  one was packaged as being specifically for &quot;mini-vans and wagons&quot; and has
  a foam covered bar that rests on the bumper. The straps carry very little
  weight and basically keep the rack from falling off the back. This rack
  has plenty of room for three bikes. On the front, I bought this contraption
  from J.C. Whipme that is a bumper mounted rack for RVs that have a bumper
  mounted spare tire. There are these big welded extension gizmos that attach
  to the bumper and a fairly normal looking bumper rack that attachs to the
  extensions. I'm not too happy with this piece of $hit. The extensions are
  very crudely made and are way too long for the VW. The bikes are held so
  far out front that they sometimes scrape on driveways and ramps. The rack
  is designed to carry two bikes, but I've been able to add a third behind, 
  between the rack and the spare tire, the wheels resting on the rack
  extensions. Maybe that will help you visualize just how far this thing
  sticks out.

  Here are a couple ideas I've though of, but haven't tried:

  Shorten or refabricate the extensions on the J.C. Whipme rack so that the
  rack is just in front of the spare.

  Use a &quot;rests on the bumper&quot; rack like Francesca got for the back and try
  and find some structure  to attach the top straps to - maybe the spare mount
  or perhaps there is something sturdy behind the fresh air vent grill. I've
  held that rack up to the front and the shape of it is just right to clear
  the spare.


  Hope this helps, and let me know if you reach a good solution for the front,
  I'm not happy with what I've got now.


  Best regards

  Dave
