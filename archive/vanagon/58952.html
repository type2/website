Subject: replacing westy interior

Hi Volks,

Has anyone changed the paneling like pieces in their westy. The cab ceiling
in mine is really nasty, buckled and the paper is falling off. I took it
out tonight to check it out. I was going to go to the home depot tomorrow
with a cabinet door (color reference) to try and match up some paneling to
replace the interior panels. All of the panels on the sides should be easy
to just trace, cut, finish the edges and put back on. The cab piece has
that bend in it and I noticed that the original piece is a little thinner
than paneling. Does anyone see any problems with this or have any
experience? Thanks

Dave
