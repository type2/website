&gt; &gt;Buy a EuroVan ;)  We already got that engine....
&gt; 
&gt; Bill , have you ever driven a Eurovan?
&gt; 
&gt; I have.  God, I HATED it!  That 5-cylinder engine right up front there 
&gt; really growls in your ears so loudly it's hard to have a conversation.  The 
&gt; one I drove, a Winnebago conversion, didn't feel any quicker, any more 
&gt; responsive or any nimbler than my '86 Westie.  But it sure was LOUD!

	Mmmmm.  &quot;growls&quot;  &quot;LOUD&quot; ??  My '73 was loud, but hey, that comes
along with air cooling.  But now my '93, it purrs.  Maybe the Winnie
conversion (w/ an automatic I bet) growls.  I would too with an RV on my
back and only a lame 4 speed automatic to get from here to there.  But my EV
with the 5 speed stick is very quiet.  Road noise is more noticeable.

The 2500 5-cylinder is a nice little engine.

BTW:  Does on automatic transmission in a bus make any sense at all?  I
could never understand it.
