Subject: water in my exhaust..

Hi,

Yesterday I noticed an unusual amount of water being spit out from my
exhaust.  I was a good 10 feet away from the exaust and could see rain
drop sized drops spewing forth...

How much (if any) water is normal in exhaust?  What horrific disease
could my baby have??

anxiously awaiting...

jg
