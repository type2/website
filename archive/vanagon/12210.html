&gt;Then there were two big backfires and now it won't start, just turns over.
&gt;I checked the stator flap, what else can I try before calling a tow truck?


I had a similar breakdown about 18 months ago. It was the condenser on the
side of the distributor &lt;lousy aftermarket piece of _at_#$%, never again anything
but Bosch&gt;. The repair cost me $8.00 and took about 15 minutes, once I figured
out what it was. The hint was a very faint spark when holding the wire from 
the coil &lt;that usually goes to the distributor&gt; close to the fan housing while
my 10 yr. old operated the starter. Kids CAN be occasionally useful, see?

Hoping it's easy and cheap,

Dave
