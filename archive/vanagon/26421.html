Subject: Re: Need r. bumper splash pans for '67 Bus

OK, all you smart alecks!...
Would you believe me if I said that I was just sniffing for availablity
before I provided the key location for repops?  I thought that I would troll
the list to see if any existed. Yeah, right.

The typical response was from M. White in Utah (the Humor state). Mike's
response was the old ROTFL. Mike was too much of a gentleman to include the &quot;AO&quot;

'67ish rear splash pans are currently being repopped by:
Darrel Combs
3121 Wentworth St.
Reidsville, NC 27320 
(910) 349-8562 

Shipped already primered and cost approx. $42.00 US plus shipping. I was
quoted $49.00 to Arizona USA.
Cashier's check, personal check or money orders. No credit cards!
Darrel claims that the repop is undistinguishable from the OEM. OK, will let
you know how they work. It sounds pretty good to me. According to Darrel, No
one is repopping the rubber for these things (yet). 

BTW: Does anyone need (want to buy) a perfectly good set of powder coated
(60% gloss black) early splash pans? =)
