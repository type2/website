&gt;The headlights on my 84 are awfull.  I was thinking of trying to get some
&gt;of the later modelsquare lights from a junkyard but I am told that they are
&gt;not much better.  Has anyone got any bright(!) and preferably economical
&gt;solutions to this problem?

my solution was to get some aftermarket round 7&quot; H4-bulbed lights. i chose
Cibie Z-Beams, but Hella and Bosch also make some pop-in replacements. you
don't have to rewire anything. just remove the four screw holding the retain-
ing ring, ease the sealed-beam bulb out, remove the electrical connector.
put the electrical connector onto the new H4-bulb (already inserted and locked
into the new non-sealed-beam unit), put the new unit back in place, and put
the retaining ring back on. if you are careful, you won't even have to
adjust the headlights. :)

cost? welllllll ... that's where they kinda getcha: about $70 for a pair of
reflectors and two H4 bulbs. :(
