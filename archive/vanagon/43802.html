Subject: Question - '78 Bus Exhaust

Hi Folks

Forgive what may be a stupid question - I'm in NYC this week and the
VWs are in NJ with their manuals...

I'm planning on replacing the exhaust system on my '78 Westy with a
one-piece unit that I bought from JC Whitney.  Right now, all I've got
is the new muffler, which replaces everything rear of the heat exchangers.

Here's the question - Do I need to get some gasket material for where
the new exhaust bolts on?  If so, can I just pick up some gasket material
at my FLAPS and cut to fit?  Should I use some Permatex stuff?  I'd like
to do it this weekend if I can find some info; the bus is really loud,
and I'll have some time this weekend...

	Thanks
		Jay
