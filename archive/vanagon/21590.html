Subject: Re:Split Window brakes

&gt;Have any of you made any cool upgrades to the brakes and what work was
&gt;required?

According to the encyclopedic Monsieur Lee Griffiths the front end out of a
68 will bolt straight into an earlier splittie and then discs from a later
bay window will then bolt up to the 68...ergo discs brakes in your split....I
haven't made this mod to my 62 yet (still looking for a reasonably priced 68
front end) but I intend to do so....

I guess it depends on how much of a purist you are and whther you want to
keep the original front end (but you can always hang on to it and put it back
right?).
