&gt;      My '84 Vanagon camper has this problem where every 30,000

&gt; the water  cooling system.  This first appears as a rising coolant
&gt; level in the overflow tank next to the oil dipstick. Next the
&gt; dashboard heater quits because it fills with gas.  Finally (about
&gt; 2K miles later) the leaking gas literally blows coolant out of most
&gt; of the cooling system and the temperature sensor begins to signal
&gt; imminent meltdown!


In my '85, I had an experience last week of coolant overflowing the 
overflow tank. Level rose. meltdown was signalled by temp. sensor. They 
drained and replaced the coolant and could find no other &quot;cause&quot;. It now 
runs fine and temp is back to normal.

Strange.
