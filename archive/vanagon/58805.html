Bill, this is the disconnecting circuit for your secondary battery.
It's a simple relay driven by the D+ port of your alternator. The
relay should switch to on when the battery light goes out. Then
the batteries are connected together. On my '80 Camper the two
heavy wires are going directly to the batteries, but they are both
read inside a black cover. The relay should be a 40 Amps, that the
original VW set up.

I am still trying to identify the mysterious black box on my '81 Westie.
Plastic, sealed, with a double, heavier black wire, like lamp cord, a
single orange wire, and a double grey wire coming out of it.  It is 3&quot; by 2
1/2&quot; by 1&quot;, with three hole flat plastic mounting flanges on two sides.  It
says part #3206, and made in Taiwan.  I found it screwed to the metal air
channel behind where the glove box goes when I was taking out the AC, but
it doesn't seem associated with the AC.  The wires all go to the fuse
panel, as near as I can tell.

Anybody else have one?

Thanks,
Bill
