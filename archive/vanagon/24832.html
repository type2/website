Subject: VWofA suing over VW piccie use???



Dear Vanagon list,
   I pulled this of rec.moto.vw as it might be relevent to some of the 
   people here who run WWW pages containing VW pictures and information. 
   I pressume this isn't a hoax or though in someways it would be better 
   if it where.

   (Apologies if someone else has already posted this but my system went 
    down at the weekend and unsubscribed me from the list, so I lost a 
    couple of days posts)
