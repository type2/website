Subject:       (Fwd) Re: Wanted:  seat belt.  can trade for a wierd step.

I'd said:
&gt;Also, i have an entry step that slides into the front and rear jack 
&gt;points on the vans.  it reportedly came on a 70's bus but still fits 
&gt;the vanagon.  NOTE:  it is extremely rusted.  the embossed/textured 
&gt;metal facia is rusted thru completely but the frame is good.  i don't 
&gt;know if it's VW product or what.  Maybe it's worth alot, maybe 

then Dean replied:
Dan,
These are neat.  Saw one once on a '93 Mexican breadloaf that a friend's dad 
drove up to visit (they are from mexico city).  He said that it is a Germany 
aftermarket thing.  I don't doubt him - he travels all over the world.  Made 
it easier to get in the bus.

I thought of making a step like that (whenever I have extra spare 
time.....).  Not sure what they are worth - have never seen another.

quadrupled.  Naw.  couldn't do that.  samo offer.
