Subject:      re Aux. Battery Isolator Relay

&gt;
&gt;I am in the process of installing an auxillary battery. I have read all I=
&gt;
&gt;can find in the archives, but still have some confusion on how to hook up=
&gt;
&gt;the isolator relay. The relay I purchased has four terminals but the
&gt;diagram shows one switching terminal goes to ground and one to the igniti=
&gt;on
&gt;switch. I had read in the archives that I could jump terminals 85 and 86 =
&gt;of
&gt;the refrigerator relay to the switching terminals of the new cut off rela=
&gt;y,
&gt;but this seems to differ from the wiring diagram that came with the relay=
&gt;=2E
&gt;Should I connect the ground terminal to ground or to termnial 86 of the
&gt;refrigerator relay (which I believe goes to the alternator)?
&gt;

Since I have my old notes sitting here, here's what I see 3 years after the
fact:
#30 is always hot lead in a VW;
#32 is always ground
#15 is switched;
#85 and #86 operate the relay;

my homemade wiring diagram shows:
#30 connected to primary battery, #87 connected to aux battery; a Ground
connection, and then the switch operation connected to the Alternator
rather than to the ignition. (this way it doesn't enable the circuit until
the alternator is actually charging. but maybe you don't want that
behaviour.)

Given your question: ground to ground, and the switch to alternator.
I don't know about your refrigerator relay though - the one I used was an X
relay specied for a Rabbit. It was rated at 30 amps.
