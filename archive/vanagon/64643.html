 I think Diesel Johns idea is great. In fact I proposed it a couple of
months ago. It helps to know where problems/for sales are so you can
ignore or pursue. It also is nice to know if someone is in the area where
you live in case you might want to get together to work on a project or
share a brew! There are a lot of maintenance and repair jobs I want to
do, but would rather have a helping hand with ( two heads are better than
one ). I try to always include my city in my signature and no one has
violated my privacy.
