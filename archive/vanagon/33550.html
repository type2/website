Subject: 1835cc Carburation Query

Looking for help for a FOAF...

He's recently put a new motor in his Bus.  It's a 1835cc running a
Solex 34 PICT 3.  He's experiencing what seems to him to be carburation
problems.  Getting the info through an intermediary, I don't know what
the exact symptoms are.

The place where he bought the motor told him he'd need a dual carb setup
for this motor, projecting lean fuel mix and valve burn if he didn't.
Being a poor student he's just using his original carb at the moment.

I'm not up on Buses or 1835's.  Could somebody with more insight comment?
What do _you_ use on your 1835?  This fellow is concerned he's being sold
a bill of goods and thinks that his stock Solex should do the job.

Please reply directly to this email account.  I'm not currently subscribed
to the Vanagon list, so replies here won't reach me.  Feel free to Cc: to
the list if you think this is of general interest.

TIA,
Mr. Bill
