 I'm sure this question has come up before but I haven't seen it. Our '85 
 Westy has about 110 K miles on the (2nd) engine, I am about to do an oil 
 change, what are your feelings about using an oil additive such as Slick 
 50 or something simular?  My mechanic says &quot;It probably woun't do any 
 harm&quot;... Will it do any good?  Will it make those first cold morning 
 starts any less drag on the engine? 
 Thanks for input

Put that money towards a good quality synthetic.
