Subject: HELP: clutch/pilot bearing update


Hi again folks!

Took the day off Friday, started working at 7:30. Couldn't
get all the CV bolts off on one side but have a half-decent
opening between the trans and the engine to work through. 
Got all the clutch parts out, up to the pilot bearing.
Given all the little bits that fell out, Tim was right,
the pilot bearing was likely the problem. Have all the
parts I need (new clutch disk pilot bearing, throwout
bearing), but can't get the g..d.. pilot bearing casing
out. Have now tried different suggested methods. The best
seemed to be to toggle a filed-down washer in on a bolt,
put a bar accross the flywheel, put a washer and a nut on
this side of the bar and screw in the nut. However, the
first 2 washers got bent out of shape. Found a stronger
washer, had to file it down for a while before it would
finally fit. Got it in TIGHT. Good. Got the nut on this
side of the bar, started torking. Thought it might be good
to tap the wrench with a hammer to give jolts rather than
a constant pull which seemed more likely to bend the washer
in the back. Eventually, just turned the wrench by hand.
Noticed after a while that we didn't seem to be getting
anywhere. i.e. I think the nut or the bolt is stripped.
Have tried sticking things on flywheel side of the bar
now and prying. Doesn't seem to be moving. Now.. Do we 
need to take off the flywheel or WHAT?? I understand 
the pilot bearing case is really hard to take out, but 
there seem to be things in front of it which won't let it 
go anywhere anyway. In my book these things are labelled
&quot;felt ring&quot; and &quot;distance ring&quot; (translated from German).
I've removed the felt ring by destroying it (I guess
I'll have to pick up a new one), but I don't know about
the other one. The exploded view of the clutch assembly
in the book shows the felt ring on the outside of the 
flywheel, but the distance ring and the pilot bearing on
the inside, as if the flywheel had to be removed first.
Of course we've tried the nuts on the flywheel. Man,
they're on tight!

By the way, I haven't found any bolts that required a 12-point
Hazett tool yet. Went in search of one Friday morning.
Found one after 2.5 hours. Took it home, tried it in the
CV bolts, didn't fit. Looked at them more closely. Turned 
out they took a 6mm Allen key.. (or was it 8mm I don't 
remember now) Maybe they've been changed before due to 
the rarity of the tool. Anyhow, 2 of them can't even be
taken off with the vice grips. My husband puts the grips 
on as tight as he can possibly make them and they just 
turn on the bolt... Any suggestions as to what to do with
these bolts? The pilot bearing? Any substance that could
help loosen things anywhere (flywheel bolts, pilot bearing)?
For instance, would a little WD-40 in the center of the
flywheel help it? (Didn't try that yet, just thought of
it before I had to leave to catch the train to come to 
work and write this e-mail!) If we have to torch out the
pilot bearing, how do you do it? Isn't is dangerous with
all this oil and stuff around? Also, unless we get the
bolts out on the right-side CV joint, we don't have a lot
of room to maneuver. (How do you &quot;drill&quot; bolts out?)

Sorry for the hectic mess of a mail. I have to catch my
hubby on the next train. We'll drop by on the way home
in case anyone has responded, despite this being Sunday
and all. Thanks a million.
