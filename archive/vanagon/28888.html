Subject: Re: what with cold weather coming up ...

&gt;i was getting some stuff from the tech bulletin file and thought this might
&gt;be a timely time to put this out for the folks who live where it gets cold.
&gt;especially if you have gotten a water-cooled vanagon recently ... the
&gt;oil cooler seal, if it breaks, can dump ALL your oil on the ground in a
&gt;big hurry, as one poor soul on the list already found out.

One poor IRATE soul too, happened after 3 days of standing with temps of 
-27C, brrrrr.  You decide if you need worry, hell NASA didn't worry about it 
in balmy Florida, should you?  Tim Smith
