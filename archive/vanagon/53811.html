&gt; And I have not changed my oil for years

money &gt; while giving me the benefits of the superiority of the syn oil.

I too have been using synthetic oil and send a sample of oil to an
indepentent testing lab at each 10,000 mile change interval.  The anaylsis
comes back time &amp; time again saying &quot;the oil is fit for continued use -
sample at normal intrervals&quot;.  I've been using Amsoil synthetic oil and the
Amsoil oil filters.  Like the filters that Mark mentioned, these filters are
able to filter out particles much smaller than typical fiters.
