&gt; &gt;&gt; SET CAR=NODRIVE to stop screwing it up.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Or else quit whining about it! Exxon et. al. only supplies YOUR demand!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hmmm... remember the Chevron Valdez?  No, wait, it was the EXXON Valdez!
&gt; &gt;I have not set wheel in an Exxon station since then.  Friendly serv or
&gt; &gt;not.  Perhaps I'm punishing the wrong villain, perhaps not, but it makes
&gt; &gt;me feel better.
&gt; 
&gt; An easy trap to fall into, Dave. As I recall, there have been lotsa
&gt; tanker spills over the years. I don't recall all the companies involved,

Hi all

Point taken about our demand for gasoline.  The Exxon thing is a real
sore point with me, too - I've not bought a drop of Exxon gas since then.
And not because they spilled oil; that was an accident, and accidents
happen.  That's why they're &quot;accidents&quot; and not &quot;intendeds&quot;.

Most oil companies, when faced with a spill, stop everything and mobilize
lots of resources to clean up their mess.  Exxon didn't move at all, and
then paid lots of &quot;environmental consultants&quot; lots of money to publish
reports that claim that the best thing you can do in the case of an oil
spill is to let the environment absorb it, and not clean it up.

It's enough to make me say &quot;yikes&quot; and never buy Exxon gas again.
