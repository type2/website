Subject: Waved by Jetta 3, and add campaigns
Date: Fri, 6 Oct 95 17:06:59 EDT

Subject says it all, blew my mind, driving along a guy
in a brand new Jetta 3 flashes then starts waving frantically
I was so dazed and confused I barely waved back.  Makes you
wonder I didn't think the &quot;drivers&quot; on the road of life knew
what an air cooled VW was.  
   On another add related subject, what the hell is Eagle doing claiming they
have originated the &quot;autostick&quot;.  Seems like a friend once had a cursed
Ghia with such a thing, VW should start fighting back in their add
campaigns against this shit.  Personally my ideal add for the
reintroduction of the EV with the V6 would be where a Caravan is
driving down the road (an early one for Ric, spewing black oil smoke)
with this guy telling you, remember the company that originated the
minivan, then as it gets over a hill, you suddenly here BEEP BEEP
and a couple hippies in a &quot;cherry&quot; splitty crest the hill and blow past the
Caravan (admittedly not a great possibility) waving peace signs. 
Then into like something along the lines of, well we've come along
way but we're still at it and go into the EV commercial.
