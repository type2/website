Subject: Re: Vanagon Awning

I fully concur with Derek's response about getting support or decent
information about things like awnings.

As some of you know, I had a fit while searching for my awning.  I was
told several times that these things don't exist, then they exists for
vans other than the Eurovan then finally that, at least one, 'could' be
modified to fit the Eurovan.

Until I showed determination and persistence, I did not get results.

Having an extended information source such as here, also helped to
reserarch and confirm snipetts that came my way.

Example: the only other awning I saw on a Eurovan had a decal on it
'APOLLO', while placing queries here I actually did not get a specific
lead to that brand but I did get other leads, and one that I eventually
pursued to a purchase. (I note that very recently, I saw someone's message
indicating that there is a product with 'apollo' as PART of the brand name).

Summation: the cohesion and cooperation here is synergistic and an
incalculable benefit.

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
