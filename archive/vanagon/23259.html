&gt;&gt;Well we could have &quot;Hands Across Hoover.&quot; Treat Bob like a pass
&gt;&gt; around pack/Pony Express kinda thing! Everybody sign up for a twentymile to
&gt;&gt; two hundred mile stretch. One thing is for sure, at least you won't be out
&gt;&gt; of luck and with out a clue if you break down!
&gt;
&gt;we could see how long vanagon.lenti people could host, move, feed,
&gt;and entertain one individual.  i suppose Bob would have to be a
&gt;willing participant in all this but if the idea gets enough
&gt;momentum, that point may become secondary!  :)

that reminds me of some foolishness that my brother was involved in during
his misbegotten days of college fraternities ... it seems that some frat
up in north carolina decided that one of their members should NOT be present
at some wedding rehearsal or some such, so they tied him up and gagged him
and drove him to the next college with a chapter of the same fraternity.
supposedly he got loose somewhere in texas. and was highly pissed.

i think that's called &quot;kidnapping&quot;?? :)

good thing it wasn't a sorority. then it would have been a violation of the
Mann Act (Herbie and Tom): transporting women across staid lions for immortal
porpoises. :)
