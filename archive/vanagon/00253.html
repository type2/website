]turning radius: :) that's where the vanagon is really neat! Amaze Your Friends!
]Surprise Your Relatives!  but the air-cooled vanagons will outturn the water-
]cooled ones. if you park it with the wheels turned to lock in one direction,
]it looks like the wheels are broken. :)

I love it!  This is one of my favorite aspects of the VW Typ II.  This is
why it's the only vehicle that will carry a Little League team AND their
gear AND manouver in a parking lot easily.

]did you guys know about that Porsche factory vanagon with their own 911
]engine ... and four-wheel disc brakes?  they did it a bit different from that
]guy in california: they raised the rear deck about 4 inches to make room for
]an oil tank and more air intake holes (in the side).  they used it as a chase
]car (carrying parts and mechanics) to prototype testing.  then some of the
]executives found out about it and started using it to car-pool to meetings. :)
]i can just see some Porsche factory executive trying to show off to his
]buddies as he zips down the Autobahn!

Drool...slobber...salivate....
