Tom says:

&gt;Cory, the salesman is scum, or at least a know-nothing. See if he has the 
&gt;manual to the car, prove him wrong!

Agreed!  Major scum.  Distrust everything he says now!

&gt;I thought diff lock was standard on all US Syncros as late as '89, (what 
&gt;say you, Jim Davis), but that could be wrong. Was this vehicle imported 
&gt;for the US market?

For the USA, rear diff lock was optional in 1986,87, &amp; 89.
Satandard equipment in 1990 &amp; 1991.
