Subject: holiday travel sights...

Part of our path over the recent holiday weekend took us from Houston to
New Orleans.  On the east side of Houston is an enormous bridge that spans
the Houston Ship Channel.  On the north side of the channel is the Great
Big Parking Lot for all of the new cars that are off-loaded from ships in
the port.  Big VW area - I remember seeing rows of Vanagons a couple of
years back, and a huge expanse of Golfs and Jettas.  But I only saw three
(3) Eurovans on Sunday...

We were cruising at 65mph in the Vanagon and passed a very nice looking
('76?) Bus going 55mph.  For trips of a 100 miles, who needs the extra
strain on the air-cooled engine to save 17 minutes?

Oddest sight: a (blue-bird) bus-based motor home towing secondary
transportation behind - a two-place helicopter! (The kind with the BIG
plexiglas bubble.)

Vanagon ran great over the 600+ miles, but sure used a lot of oil (will
break 100k miles this week).  No blue cloud...
