Also, it looks as if the last two weekends in October are the favored
possiblities.  Which of those specifically, is yet to be decided.  By
weekend, I mean for sure Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, leaving open
for people the possibility to start out as early as the Wednesday
before, and/or leave the following Monday to avoid traffic.  I am
told that there are not only certain days but also certain hours which
dictate heavy border crossing traffic, so we will probably want to plan
an hour to cross over when we will hope not to have a 4 hour delay.

Let me know if you're in or out....
