&gt; Sam Taylor Park on the Marin side of GGBR has group sites.

samual p. taylor park is where i rebuilt 3 van engines on one pik-nik 
bench dureing a very hot summer about 8 or 9 years ago.

i will only do consultant work on any repairs that need to be done, this 
time.

i saw enough volkswagon innards to last me a long time in that park, and 
i haven't been back since.
