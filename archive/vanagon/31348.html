Subject: RE: TIRE QUESTIONS?


&gt;1.  Is the high ply tires needed for vans because:
&gt;
&gt;a.) The weight of the van
&gt;b.) Because the handling is so odd and the added ply is required for 
stifness
&gt;and intern      better handling.
&gt;c.) None of the above.


The answer is (b) and (c). And (d), if (d) is:

d) Most VW vans have huge cargo-carrying capacity-- see the &quot;Gross Weight&quot;
specification in the oweners manual. If you fill it up with firewood or
whatever until it reaches this max weight, you will overstress ordinary car
tires-- that is, load them to a higher weight than that specified on the
tire sidewall.
