&lt;&lt;   I am interested in installing a Weekender-style pull out bed.  Is this
 possible (the van is a 84) ?  Are the fittings the same for the normal seat
 and the puul-out seat ?  Has anyone done this ?

     The rear bumper is missing, and I was quoted &gt; $800 for a new one.  Will
I
 have trouble finding a good bumper at the junk yard, and how involved is it
to
 replace this ? &gt;&gt;


yes, you can put a weekender interior into a pre 85 van (BTDT, and BTW I've
got 2 weekender interiors for sale.. anyone interested?)
and as far as the 800 for a back bumper..... YEAH, RIGHT!!!   whoever told
you that was really yankin your chain....
You can get NEW ones for about 100......
