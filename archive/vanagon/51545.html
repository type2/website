&gt; &gt; &gt; and alternator lights lit up but very dimly (it was dark), about 15 seconds
&gt; &gt; &gt; later, they pulsated and became dimmer, then went out! I pulled over and
&gt; &gt; &gt; found a mist of coolant on the rear bumper, and when I opened the inspection
&gt; &gt; &gt; door behind the license plate, again, the coolant was full to the top and
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently had blown excess out the top which the engine had apparently
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     Sad to say, you have a blown head gasket. The combusion gas is leaking
&gt; &gt;     into the cooling system, forcing the coolant out!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     This last line you typed said it all!

&gt; Eric, if this is so, why did the coolant not fill up the overflow reservoir on the way 
&gt; home (from combustion gases again displacing even more coolant)? I would expect this to 
&gt; be an ongoing and relentless problem. It is now staying at a &quot;normal&quot; level? I would 
&gt; expect for the cooling main tank to suck all of the overflow reservoir dry when the 
&gt; engine cools down (since some is being displaced by combustion), but it's not?
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on this?

   Simply, You didn't push the motor  hard on the return trip. 
   
   Try this. Go for a ride.
   Run the motor easy. Check the over flow level. Them go for another
   ride. Get on the highway, 4th gear, keep your foot on the floor at
   least up and down 2 large hills. (no joke this is how I found
   out about my problem). Check the level again, before it cools.
   IF you have a bad head gasket the overflow will be filled! 

   Warning driving at excessive speeds are bad for your health!
