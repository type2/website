&gt;I'm beginning to
&gt;think the fridge problem is us, tho.  The level guage is too important for
&gt;refrigeration;  I believe we are not levelling the van properly and this is
&gt;the heart of our difficulties.

Gary, why don't you explain the importance of levelling the van for proper
refrigeration to the whole list?  I don't understand it myself.  I do
observe the caution in the owner's lit that the propane should not be
engaged on a slope greater than 6% lest it harm the burners.

I would like to know what you know on this subject.
