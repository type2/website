Subject: Re: Front heater motor replacement

You do have to drop the steering wheel (need to drill out the breakoff
bolts) and remove the dash.  It's lots of unscrewing, but pretty
straightforward.   One person can do it  (lifting the dash out and in is a
little awkward).   (To reattach the steering you need two new breakoff
bolts from the dealer.)   The Bentley manual describes the process very
well.    After the dash is out, you need to separate the halves of the
heater housing and pull out the blower.    The one on our 87 gradually got
slower and slower, then froze and blew the fuse (new fuses blew in about 5
sec).    Do you have the right size in that circuit?

&gt;Does the dash have to be removed?  Does the stearing wheel drop down out of
&gt;the way?  Any idea of a replacement part?  I don't know if the dropping
