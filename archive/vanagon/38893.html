&gt;  According to Piaget linear concrete thinking stops being a problem at
&gt;about age 5 or 6 when we learn to use abstract concepts.  Get over it!

no wonder i have so much trouble with the real world!!! i never learned to
use them abstract concepters ... kept poking myself in the eye with them! :(
so i just use the regular concepts. it's not as fast, but then, my reality
doesn't fray along the edges (like it does when you use abstract concepts).

and what's all this &quot;linear concrete&quot; stuff?? everybody down here knows that
concrete is FLAT. period. flat, flat, flat. well ... unless you make a
pillar or something with it. and the sides of it are still flat!

fences are linear.

boy! this is as bad as that damn trigonomical class ... the teacher was
always talking about &quot;pie are square&quot;. dern fool. pie are round! cornbread
are square.
