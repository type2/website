Subject: Geologic time scale and oil origin

I'm a little rusty at this but I thought that the fossil fuels (coal and oil) 
originated from the Carboniferous period, which predates the Jurassic by a few 
million years.  I may be wrong - &quot;I'm a biologist Jim, not a petroleum 
geochemist.&quot;

FYI:

Period         Millions of Years Ago        Big Events
__________     _____________________        __________________________
Quaternary       0 to   2 m.y.a.            4 major Ice Ages
Tertiary         2 to  65 m.y.a.            Humans Appear
Cretaceous      65 to 135 m.y.a.            Dino extinction
Jurassic       135 to 197 m.y.a.            Dinos rule the Earth
Triassic       197 to 225 m.y.a.            Dinos appear
Permian        225 to 280 m.y.a.            Cool period, many extinctions
Carboniferous  280 to 345 m.y.a             Shallow seas, coal swamps
etc...

By the way, I've been following the silver socket discussion, and our 81 Camper 
has it and although it is shown in the instrument console figure in the manual, 
it is not labelled or mentioned anywhere.  On the group's advice, I'll keep my
fingers out of it.  Next question: Can we figure out how to wire a useful 
gadget from it?
