Subject: Seattle Times discovers VW campers

A long article in the Sunday Seattle Times (Travel Section) discussed the
writer's first foray into VW camping (after many years of tent camping).
The article is way too long to post, but in summary she liked it a lot, but
thought that the EV Camper she rented was too expensive for her. (Of course
she quoted List Price on it rather than Going Price.)
A sidebar discusses RV rental options, including AdventureWerks in
Bellingham &amp; New Mexico. (I didn't know they also rented VW buses!).
