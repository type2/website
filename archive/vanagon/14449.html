Subject: Re: inverted clay pot Q

I'm talking about a clay pot inverted over the rack of the stove,
so it is elevated about 1&quot; above the flame.  The pot is about 10&quot;
or so - actually haven't measured it, but it's the same size
as my '81 westy sink, as it parks in there just perfectly when
not in use.
