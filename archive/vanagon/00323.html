It's been a while, but I made two attempts to rebuild the wiper motor on
my '78.  As I recall it was a matter of failing PLASTIC gears.  Ultimately
I gave up &amp; got a new one at a dealer ($160+ at the time - ouch).  Had it
to do over I'd have researched a good used one.

I remember it being quite easy to remove the motor.  The wiper arms come
off first at the motor pulls out below the dash.  I think I had to pop the
heater hoses off first.

Good luck,  Tim Burnett (n9135171_at_henson.cc.wwu_dot_edu
