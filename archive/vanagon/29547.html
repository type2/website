Subject: thanxgiving cattle drive...

    Dear list,
 Just got back from a 1500 mile trip through the mountains of southeastern
Oregon. Figured I'd let the turkey live and take the bus (&quot;Festus&quot;, 73
westy) out into the country instead. It was the first big trip after I put
in the 1800cc engine and the Alpine stereo, so I didn't really know how it
would turn out. Turned out great: No mechanical problems except a flat tire
while offroading. Even gas mileage is better than with the old 1700, about
20mpg. I started in Coos Bay on the southern Oregon coast on wednesday nite,
had a few beers with friends in Eugene, then headed seriously east. Crossed
the Cascades in the nite, then popped my top near &quot;Crack-in-the-ground&quot; in
eastern Oregon. Gotta love that pine\sage smell ! Clear skies. No rain.
Incredible if you live on the coast...Next day drove along the Owyhee
Canyon, mainly to scout for possible future whitewater trip. Then headed for
Steens Mtns., a volcanic fault block that rises over a mile from the
surrounding countryside. Almost vertical towards the east, gradually towards
the west, which is really nice 'cause you can drive rite up there ! Steens
summit is the highest point you can drive to in Oregon (9730 ft). No snow
yet ! On my way down I saw my first ever cattle drive! About 200 head of
cattle, 6 cowboys with all the trimmings plus half a dozen dogs...I was
waving at them and they were flashing me a peace sign ! it was WAY
cool...later I soaked about an hour in one of the countless hotsprings in
the area...You know, that area is so nice, we should have a bus-bash there
sometime, burn a few engine parts...eat prunes...
    ciao,
                gregor
