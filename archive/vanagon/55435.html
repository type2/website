First off, Congrats!

The EV manual, or at least the one that came with my EV, does not have any 
info on the Weekender package...or specific info on the MV. It seems to be a 
&quot;universal&quot; English version, as it lists equipment that is available 
everywhere else but in the US, so you are not missing much.

One thing you may want to do is to check your new manual....the early EV 
manuals had an &quot;addendum page&quot; slipped into the manual. The old manuals 
referred to the oil capacity of the EV w/filter as 4.9 quarts...and the 
addendum says its 5.9 quarts. Check your manual, which can be ordered from 
any VW dealer, and if necessary make the correction.
