Subject: Removing Speedo Face '80

Sean - 

Yes, I have removed the needle.  Learn from my mistakes.

You shouldn't have to do it, avoid it if you can is the first rule.

The needle has a pre-load applied by the spring.

If you take the needle off without noting how much pre-load is 
applied, installing later will leave it inaccurate.  Mine's low by 
about 4mph.

With the face exposed, gently lift the needle over the 0 mph stop and 
allow it to come to rest on it's own.  I'd do this with the face 
flat, face up.  Make a mark on the speedo face of this location on 
easily removed tape or a Post-It note (don't remove it tho)

Protect the face of the speedo with something like cardboard from a 
cereal box and pry off the speedo needle.  It does NOT come off 
easily, but be gentle.  After the needle is off there are two brass 
screws to remove to get the face off.  These also do NOT come off 
easily and very easy to damage.

Spend the time to find/make screwdriver that FITS the screw.  One 
slip and the speedo face gets scratched.  I filled my scratches in 
with a black permanent marker and had to file the screw head to make 
them look nice again.

Re-installation should be the reverse.

Thought I'd make this procedure public also.
