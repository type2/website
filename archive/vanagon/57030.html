Subject: Re: Three (!) Syncro Westies for sale (FWD)

&gt; Behind Door #1, the fixer of the group,
&gt; but worth the effort if you want the rare moon roof :-): 
&gt; 
&gt; 1987 VW VANAGON CAMPER IN GOOD
&gt; CONDITION. SYNCRO ALL WHEEL DRIVE, A/C,
&gt; SINK, 3-WAY FRIDGE, POWER LOCKS, AM/FM
&gt; STEREO CASSETTE, MOON ROOF, AND MORE.
&gt; RECENTLY REPLACED HEADS. ONLY 58,000
&gt; MILES. NEEDS GAS TANK. HAS BEEN OFF THE
&gt; ROAD FOR 9 MOS. ASKING $10,000. 
&gt; (508) 369-7352 [Day] 
&gt; bpasha1034_at_aol_dot_com
&gt; Concord, MA
&gt; ****
&gt; 

I would note that any syncro that has not been moved in that long a 
time might be suspect for seal failure on the viscous coupling 
regardless of the low miles, still a real damn apealing price, want 
to sell your extra tank Tom?
