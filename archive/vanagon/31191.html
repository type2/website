Subject: Rough Clutch, How bad is bad?
Date: Tue, 19 Dec 95 10:33:00 PST


Howdy all,

Last night, while preparing the bus (83 Westy) for its first long trip (with 
me as the pilot), I noticed that the clutch was beginning to get a little 
rough.  Conceptually, I have a good understanding of the workings of a 
clutch but when it comes to the mechanics of it all I am clueless, so bear 
with me.  Here is what is going on: when engaging the clutch it vibrates 
along with the engine and emits a very slight rubbing noise.  There is no 
screeching or loud noises, and it is still rather easy to engage the clutch 
and transmission.  So all that I can guess it that something is going on in 
there, but I have no idea.  Is this something that can slide, or should it 
definitely be taken care of before a 1500 mile trip?  Any input would be 
appreciated.  Please respond to my personal address as well as the list as 
my server can only process 1/2 of each digest.

Thanks,
Bill Ernest
