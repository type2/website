Subject:       moving to california emissions?

There is a chance i may be moving to California in the next 3 to 5 
years.  i was wondering what it takes to get a vehicle californeized. 
Should i just forget about my '72 bus and find another when i get 
there or is there a chance that this original detroit smog machine is 
saveable?  The engine and carbs are original but is any extra 
equipment required?  How about my '76 cutlass? that thing is just a 
body, engine, and carb.  while constructing this beast my whole 
philosophy has just been &quot;make it go faster&quot;.  my cars have always 
been old enough to be exempt from the now completely defunct michigan 
emissions laws so not a single one of em has any polution controlls 
at all.  If california has those nasty safety inspections some states 
have i may as well forget the whole thing.
thanks.
Ed.
