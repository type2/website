   Daqvid &amp; Listees,

  I recently went to AVP Engines in Sacramento:)  I went there to see the
shop, and decide if we wanted to use their services for our rebuilt engines.
After spending the WHOLE day at AVP, with Leonard and crew.  I decided that
they would Definitly be the people to supply our shop with Longblocks!

  From what I saw in the process that the engines were dealt with. I was
VERY impressed!  No corners were cut, and Leonard knows when he ships a
motor that ALL things are checked exactly the same each time.  This was one
of the things I liked the most.  Every piece of the engine had it's own
Quality Control mark on it.  Any AVP employee could look at any part of an
engine, look for the different marks and tell at exactly what stage that
part is or was.  This makes for a high quality product.

  I wanted to pass this info on to BOTH lists because I got to see what only
a few list members will see, AVP on the inside.

  IMHO, AVP has the best product availible today in the aftermarket, their
prices are fair for what you get.  They offer an Extended Warranty if you
choose.  Here's their URL,http://www.sacbiz_dot_com/avp/  there is a complete
Price List of Engines on their Web Site!

  Glad I could pass on this info to someone looking for an engine, and also
the list's as a Whole 8-)
