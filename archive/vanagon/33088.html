&gt;&gt; a VW?
&gt;&gt; 

Err, ahem, and out of the closet in a single bound...

Dropped off wife and mother-in-law at art gallery in very busy area, blocked
traffic to do so, much traffic. The MIL had bad knees and wanted to be as
close as possible to the entrance. I open the sliding door, jump down to
help her/wife out, then lock and slam the sliding door. The little click of
the latch was still in my ears as I realized that now ALL the doors were
locked, the engine running, half a block of traffic now built up and angry.
It was a one-way one-lane street, cars parked on both sides.
         I walked to my door and belted the vent window in frustration, upon
which it shattered into little sparkly bits. Quite surprised and relieved
somewhat I wind down the window and let myself in.  The next day the dealer
tells me the vent window is $195CDN, doooooh!  The next week or so, with a
Lexan triangle fitted in place I discover that the door locks were worn out
and could be opened with a dime, doooooh noooooh.
