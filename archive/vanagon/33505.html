Subject: Cold Starting Question
Date: Tue, 23 Jan 96 10:58:00 PST


Stupid question of the day:

I am finding that I have a much easier time starting the Van in cold weather 
if I give the accelerator a pump before starting the engine.  I know that 
most later model (all?) VWs have a choke of some sort, so it seems like this 
shouldn't be helping.  Do any of you out there pump a little on the gas 
pedal before starting or I am just trying to flood my engine every morning?

Now mind you, cold in Portland is 38 Degrees F, so no flames please :)
