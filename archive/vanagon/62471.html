&gt; A properly tuned TDI motor should not smoke and is very clean, emissions-
&gt; wise.  It's real appeal (to me, anyway) is that it has diesel mileage
&gt; coupled with gas engine performance (i.e. doesn't have a 0-60 of 20 secs.
&gt; or whatever it is).

My next door neighbor has always bought the latest VW, and now she has
a new Passat TDI. The car puts out a LOT of smoke. It is not a heavy black
smoke, but more greyish; it still stinks pretty badly however. She
says she gets nasty looks all the time. She also has had a few people
honk the horn and hold their nose when they pass her car. The car is
very well maintained by the excellent local VW dealer, and runs perfectly.

The most smoke is on acceleration from a stop. Out on the highway, smoke
is less noticable, but still smells badly. But, then, so do M-B's.
