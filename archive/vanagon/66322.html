I can't help you, but I had something similar happen. I had a
bolt fall out of the linkage resulting in losing gears 1,2 and 5. And
the
shifter went really limp! Since I was on warranty and the free autoclub,

I had it towed and the dealer fixed for free.

I wonder if there's a design flaw here.

===============================

My 95 EVC 5 speed had a similar trouble at 20k mi.
In late June, after 3 days in Death Valley's heat, my gear shift
refused to find 1st and 2nd; made it to VW through downtown Las Vegas
stop lights in 3rd: the mechanic found that the screws holding down
the shift plate had popped. Was a simple fix under warranty.
