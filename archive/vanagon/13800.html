  The question is now &quot;what to do&quot;? I was looking through the Rocky Mountain
  Motorworks catalog and it looks to me like it is cheaper to buy a GEX
  rebuilt than it is to buy all the parts to do it yourself &lt;?!&gt; Why is this?

I recently went through this myself.  

How much time have you got?  If you don't do this sort of thing everyday, 
it does take a bit of time to build up a motor.  I spent about $500.  It 
took a month of weekends to gather together all the bits, have the machine 
work done, and assemble the motor.  I learned a lot, but next time I'm 
not sure I'll want to spend all that time when I could just buy a motor, 
mount the tin, bolt it in, and go.  You can get perfectly acceptable long 
blocks around here for $500 -- I drove one for 10 years before this latest 
rebuild.
