Subject: Goo Gone!

I just wanted to say thanks for who those emailed to me for the restoring 
tips on Westfalia '66. 
I was working on my Westfalia today, I discover there was a tar blotter 
in my cabinet so I used &quot;Goo Gone&quot; by Citrus Power to remove the tar. It 
really works and the paint on the wood still stays there! I would 
recomned this product for restoring on bus!
