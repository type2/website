&gt; &gt;The LT series vehicles are referenced as  LT 30, LT 35, LT 40. The

&gt; 4 tons.

&gt; Even the 6 Zylinder seems not to be the original one. The LT is
&gt; equipped
&gt; with AUDI 5 Cyl.. engines. I may be wrong and have to check the
&gt; leaflets.

    The LT chassis based Westfalia SvenHedin I brought to the US back in
the '70s
    had a 6cyl VW/Audi diesel... the '82 Volvo DIESEL I owned had a
6cyl  VW/Audi
    diesel... they were totally gutless, noisy and smelly (~78 HP) but
very fuel
    conservative.
