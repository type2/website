Subject: Re: Circuit Breaker '81 Westy


My response:  A GFI is a good idea -- I'd put it into where the outlet
is.  These are not circuit breakers, though.  The breaker in my 80
Westfalia is a standard unit (which I need to replce as well).  I am
sitting looking at an outlet strip, $4 at Target, with the same breaker.
Kind of a shame to dissect it for a little part, but sure beats $38!
The one in my hand is 15 amps, which should be fine (the outside plug
is a 15-amp'r so you wouldn't want more inside).  I'm going to shop
at an Electronic surplus store Thursday for this breaker -- they're
real common, and should be about a buck.  I'll pick up two if they
have 'em, and mail you one.  I also need to find that little fuse from
the refrigerator...

Trying to get the camper in shape to head north with the wife and
kidlets to see if we can see the Inuvik'ers on the road.  We're going
to try to make it to Alaska.  Hope the poor veedub'll hold up!
Last year it was 8000 miles around the lower 48 (we only hit about 40
of 'em, tho').
