Hi all VW folks,
I just subscribed and wanted to introduce myself.  I  am amazed at all of
the interest.  I acquired an 82 westy a year ago March.  Immediately had
to swap out the gas tank.  (Big rust holes) Then gutted the inside and
redid a bunch of stuff and rewired some switches and custom panel and
lights etc.    Took it to california  for a month.  I figured wherever it broke
down is where i would move.  It didn't break.  The day after I returned to
the land ofZion (Utah), the tranny went out.  Not sure if that is luck or
what.  I could have escaped the zion curtain.  It is interesting to see all
the activity.  I was curious about the red marks on the Speedo and
shifting.  I tend to go beyond them when going up hill.  Is this real bad or
just potentially bad.  I try to keep it under to the extent possible.  

I have Michelins which have a max pressure of 40 psi

I do love the bus!!  Best thing I ever did.  Would be interesetd in linking up
with others for outside fun. Is there a Utah or intermountain
contingent???   CCC sounds fun.   Thanks for all the insight.  I'll probaly
get fired for getting all these emails at work but then I can go on tour.  
Going down the road.......
