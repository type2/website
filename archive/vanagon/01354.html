Subject:  Installation of Roof-Mount Antenna on Camper (Longish)

Fellow Vanagon/Bus Netters,

I's like to brag about a moderate success I had last weekend fitting
a new radio antenna to my '81 Vanagon Westphalia.

I bought the camper about 1-1/2 years ago with a really poor radio
in it, but had suffered along with it until a good deal on an Alpine
pull-out jumped in my lap recently.  I thought that as long as I was
changing out the radio, I'd upgrade the antenna, too.  I have been
itching for an excuse to do this, because I did it years ago to my
'76 Westphalia and was really pleased with the result.

You all know how to install a radio, so I won't bore you with that
part.  Installing the Alpine pullout was routine, except that the
chassis box wouldn't quite fit through the opening in the dashboard.
To solve that problem, I hacksawed a diagonal cut about 1/32&quot; into
the metal dash from each corner of the radio opening, then took the
largest iron bar I could find (actually a big file) and tapped it
semi-gently with a medium ball-peen hammer in both directions at
each corner.  That spread the sides of the box just enough that the
radio chassis fit perfectly.

But that's not the story.

I wanted a powered electronic antenna on the roof, rather than that
ugly thing mounted on the front passenger side.  I went to my local
FLAPS (Friendly Local Auto Parts Store) and picked up a $19.95
Universal electronic fender mount antenna; the kind that unfolds
like a pocket knife and then telescopes out to 16&quot;.  The antenna
itself pivots 180 degrees out of the base, so when you extend it,
you can always find a position that is vertical.  The trade name was
Harrada or something vaguely Asian sounding.  There was a wide range
of models on their display board.  I measured the diameter of the
plug on the end of the antenna cable and determined that it was 3/8&quot;
in diameter (need this measurement for drill and grommet size) and
about 1-1/2 inches long.  I also got a 24&quot; extension antenna cable,
a 1&quot; plastic plug for the hole that would be left in the old antenna
hole in the front of the bus, a 3/8&quot; rubber grommet and some silicon
caulking/sealer.

First I demounted the roof rack part of the camper top over the
front seats (four screws and four nuts - easy).  Boy!  is 13 years
worth of gradoo on the roof underneath ugly!  I washed the roof and
put on a quick coat of wax.

Inside the bus, I removed the right-side sun visor mount to expose
the hole in the ceiling where the pivot for the sun visor sits
(you don't need to remove the part where the free end of the visor
clips in, just the pivot part).  The hole is about 7/8&quot; in diameter
and there is a little more than one inch clearance behind that hole
up to the sheet metal above.  I pushed the plug on the end of the
antenna cable through to ensure that there was enough clearance to
maneuver the plug under the sheet metal above and over toward the
right-side windshield pillar.  I believe that a plug much longer
than 1-1/2&quot; will be too long, so check carefully before proceeding.

To ensure that there was a clear cable run down the right windshield
pillar, I tied a steel nut larger than the diameter of the antenna
cable plug to a piece of string and fed it into the visor pivot hole
(from inside the car) and shoved it forward and to the right into
what appeared to be the top of the windshield pillar.  The nut went
in OK, but stopped at the handgrip mounted about a foot down; but
when that was removed I could see the string passing by as I fed it
into the visor pivot hole.  Remove the glove box from in front of
the passenger's seat.  There is an access hole on the front (front!)
of the door frame, large enough to reach around and get most of your
hand into, just about at the level of the lower edge of the
dashboard panel.  Just feel around there and you'll find it.  I
found the nut on the string 'way to the outside of the space behind
there.  Keep trying - you'll find it if you've fed in enough string
at the top.  Leave the string there once you fish out the nut.  That
becomes the lead you'll use to draw the antenna cable down the
windshield pillar space.

Once satisfied that there was room to fit everything, I drilled a
3/8&quot; hole (the diameter of the antenna plug, remember?) up through
the center of the windshield pivot hole and through the roof.  (I
must admit a considerable amount of trepidation at this point, but I
said to myself, &quot;What the hell:  the car is 13 years old anyhow and
if this doesn't work, I'll just fill the hole with a plug and
silicone goop and put everything back together the way it was.
Nobody will ever know&quot;.) You will drill through one layer of steel
before you start to drill into the exterior roof, so all together,
you will drill through two layers of steel.  Whew!  De-burr the
holes as best you can:  there will be electrical wires running
through them.

I then selected the position to mount the antenna on the roof rack
over the passenger's head.  I think it's good above the right-side
roof rack mounting screw, mounted vertically and facing fore-and-aft
on the edge of the roof rack, so that the antenna folds back (not
forward) to lock into its base.  I chose a position that far back so
that I could have a drip-loop in the cable.  (I don't know if that's
the proper term, but it puts an S-shaped dip in the cable so that
water running down the cable from any leak around the antenna base
will form a drip and fall off before it can pass through the hole in
the roof and become a leak.) I drilled the roof rack and mounted the
antenna, using the 7-degree angled base gasket that comes with the
antenna to compensate for the slight outward tilt of the roof rack
edge.

Lift the roof rack back up onto the roof and set it loosely in
place.  Feed the antenna cable and power wire one at a time
(cable first) through the hole in the roof and into the car through
the visor pivot hole.  Yes, the cable is a tight fit going through
the roof because of the spring-thingie on the plug.  Now pull as
much as you can of the cable/wire through.  Tape the cable and wire
together at 6&quot; intervals to keep everything together during
installation.  Now tie the string to the antenna cable/wire and wrap
some electrical tape over the cable plug and knot to make the whole
thing smooth and tapered so it won't catch on anything (you will now
have the cable/wire going into the tape which smoothly tapers down
to a piece of string coming out of the tape).  Now, using the end of
the string under the dash, start to gently pull the cable/wire back
into the sun visor pivot hole.  Soon you'll have a small loop of
cable/wire trying to pull itself back through the visor pivot hole:
help it - then everything is suddenly all inside the roof.  Pull the
cable/wire out the other end and the hard part's done!  Reinstall
the sun visor, glove box and hand grip.

Go up to the roof and fit the grommet around the cable/wire going
into the hole in the roof (you'll probably have to cut the grommet
because the plug might be too big to slip through the grommet before
you feed it into the roof).  Pull back enough slack out of the car
to make the drip loop on the cable/wire.  Slather a big glob of
silicone sealer onto the wire/cable and grommet and roof.  Bolt and
screw the roof rack back on.  Connect the antenna cable extension to
the antenna so it'll reach the radio and put electrical tape over
the joint.  Then just connect the radio as usual.  Don't forget to
lead power to the antenna, too.  The base of the antenna I bought
has a nut and screw through the pivot point that allows you to
adjust how tightly the antenna is pinched.  I needed to tighten this
screw because on the road, wind pressure blew the erected antenna
back from vertical.

Remove the old antenna from wherever it was and plug the hole with
the 1&quot; (mine was, anyway) plastic plug and some silicone goop to
seal it.  Perhaps one of you can think of a more elegant way to do
this, but I didn't want to get into body work.

Thanks for your patience in reading this.  Hope some of you take
inspiration from my effort.  I'm really pleased with the way it
looks and works.

I also installed an awning a couple of weeks ago, but that'll be
another story.
