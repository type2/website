Subject: 86 GL intermittent running problem on start

Hello to everyone out there in VW-land, I hope everyone's Friday is going
better then mine, have been having a problem, when started it will act like
it's running out of gas. This happens in hot (running temp) and cold
situations about 5% of the time. it will not die, but will not accelerate
(small backfires) and the idol (after kicking in the clutch) will drop to
about 2-400 rpm. In the past (up until about an hour ago) all I did to
remedy was to kick in the clutch and key it off for about 3-4 seconds kick
it back over and away I go with no more problems. Today (Warm engine had
just made a 15min stop) I had to repeat about 3 times then finally just let
it idol (200rpm) for about 10-15 sec and it leveled out to 900rpm with no
more problems all the way back to the office (30mile). BTW Have put on
sense I got it in February:

(OEM)
plugs 
plug wires
Dist cap

(VW Recall)
idol stab
ECU
gas tank
fuel filter
assorted fuel hoses

O2 Sensor (Bosch generic)
all exhaust ex converter
starter (not really relevant, but oh well)

I have really not done anything to it in the past several weeks so I think
something is failing. BTW I know you're supposed to change your ignition
coil regularly on most vehicles, how often for the Vanagon?
also, I have front brake parts on the way and have a question. Do I need a
press to Install bearings/race into new rotors? I have done brakes on lots
of domestic cars, and 2 Nissan's if memory serves, so I know my way around
brake systems pretty good. But I know VW's always seem to be a bit
different. TIA
