Robert, about the quantum engine swap to Vanagon..

&gt;Aside from finding that I will need a different
&gt;transmission,

Why would that be?, I thought that you would put your clutch,
flywheel, etc. onto the quantum engine.

&gt; I am wondering if anyone has the part # for the exaust pipe
&gt;that will go from the turbo to the muffler, or will this part need to be
&gt;made localy?

When I got to that point, I towed my camper to a local muffler shop,
and had them make the pipe from the turbo exit to the muffler.   The pipe 
makes a U turn from the turbo and runs outside the engine cover.
 I found a larger diameter muffler looking through the local auto parts
catalog.  The whole deal cost about $95.  An alternate would be and
try for the factory van TD parts from Germany or England.

Brent
