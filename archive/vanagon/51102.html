Subject: Re: First Westy questions....

&gt;The propane on/off knob on the outside of the van leaks propane
&gt;when turned on.  I guess that it's a seal of some sort that needs
&gt;replacing.  I suppose I can get a rebuild kit at an RV place?  

The same thing happened to my '85.  I went to a local Propane dealer and he 
installed a generic non-VW valve on my tank for about $30, parts and labor, 
including new gaskets.  This compared to threats of out-of-production parts 
and/or price quotes in the hundreds (??!!) from local RV specialists and 
the VW dealer

&gt;Two of the three camper panels on the outside of the van have lost
&gt;the spring tension they're supposed to have.  They're not flapping in
&gt;the breeze yet, but does anyone sell the spring-loaded replacements?  I
&gt;seem to remember someone saying these things wear out from time to time.

To my knowledge, you have to buy the entire fixture to get a door.  If 
anyone knows this to be incorrect, please let me know.

By the way, the Bentley manual has a large section on the Westy camper 
gear, which may help answer some of your other questions.
