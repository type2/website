Subject: Re: 84 Running rich

If you solve this problem let me and everyone on the list know.  There are a
whole bunch of 84 owners out there including myself who have been fighting
this thing. I have replaced everything in my fuel system and most of the
things in the ignition system.  Still runs like a Jack Rabbit when cold but
deteriorates when it warms up.
