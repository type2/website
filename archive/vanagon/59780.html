Subject: thanks for info (re:lure of syncro)


Thanks to all who replied to my request for information.  I've seen the 
'87 syncro camper (not a GL), and it's in decent shape except for a CV 
joint that needs to be replaced.  It has an excellent interior and body, 
rear diff. lock, and the heads have been done already (new heads).  The 
engine has about 113k, and though it idles a little roughly, it runs 
well.  I'm still not sure about jumping into the world of the syncro, but 
it hasn't sold yet.  By the way, the guy was asking $5300 for it, and 
he's only the second owner.

Meanwhile, I'm taking care of my '87 camper that has logged 20K since I 
bought it last July.  I'll be driving back across the country next week, 
so I shouldn't talk too loudly about another vanagon.
