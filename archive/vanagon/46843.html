Subject: Web site update

Hi Volks,
  Just wanted to tel everyone that I have updated the 'Swap Area' page of
the Web site.  Who knows you might find what your looking for.

   I was looking for people to do a business card exchange.  If you have a
business card would you send me one.  I'm collecting them. I will gladly
send you mine in return.

    BTW, only 3 more days til &quot;Transporters by The Tunnel&quot;  if your
interested let me know.  We could make this event a vanagon list event too.
Take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim
