Mike,

I had this problem when I replaced my vent window on my 85 Westy.  I removed
the window and bent the upper attatchement down slightly.  This way, when I
reinstalled the window, the attaching screw on the top was slightly
missaligned and caused enough friction to prevent the window from pivoting.
