Subject: help-gas tank straps

After much persuasion from fellow listmembers, I have decided to keep
my bus for now and fix the leaky gas tank.  This is a 79 bus.

This morning, I removed the bolts holding the gas tank straps down.
That went fine.  But, now the straps won't come out.  There's nothing
holding them in, or is there?

I took off the two front bolts, and the rear bolt which holds each strap in place.  But those straps won't move!

Any ideas?

Paul
