Subject: breadloaf air flow meter

There is a strange situation with my 79 bus.
When I turn the key to the 'on' position, the fuel pump turns on.
Supposedly, this is a fire hazard!  The fuel pump should only run 
when the key gets turned to the 'start' position.

This all leads(I think) to the air flow meter.  Is this the probable 
cause?  How do I test it?

Paul
