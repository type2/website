Dean writes...
&gt; I got the crew cab home this weekend and the heat riser tube on the dp 
&gt; manifold is rusted thru and broken on the left side. Is there a way to fix 
&gt; this or do I need a new manifold. I know this is important for 
&gt; driveability, warmup, etc, so I want to have it working. 

I'd rather have it, than not.  DP intake manifolds should be cheap at
junkyards.  I have several I couldn't sell for $1 each at a swap-meet.

&gt; Can the stock, cheap beetle mufflers be used on '68-'71 type 2s?

Yes, they can.  If the tailpipes rub on the bumper, bend them down.

&gt; Also, what causes the trans to jump out of fourth gear when it gets worn. 
&gt; What parts need to be replaced to fix this. It would be nice to have it 
&gt; right instead of using the bungee method, although the bungee method is 
&gt; probably much cheaper.

You answered your own question.  Wear makes these transaxles jump out of
gear.  I'd get a rebuilt transaxle, or buy William Claspy's, wpc_at_po.cwru_dot_edu,
good used box.
