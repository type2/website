&gt;&gt;First time post been on list about 3 months wonderful information
&gt;&gt;Question: opinions wanted on 91 Westfalia,52,000 miles, poptop, bed
&gt;&gt;,no sink,
&gt;&gt;no frig.  2 rear facing seats in back a/c heat good interior $11,900.
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; I got look at it earlier today. Going back later today to test drive.
&gt;&gt;Hope to get some ideas as to what other list members might think of this    
&gt;&gt;setup and any questions i should ask.  I'm not mechanically  inclined.
&gt;&gt;                                 
I prefer the non-kitchen setup for most sports and for 7+ people/kids.  
And when we camp we typically do so outside anyway with
separate camp stove etc. esp. since we have 3 kids so we like to get
outside.  $11,900 is a great deal from what I've seen in N. California
where these are usually $15K+.
