Subject: bill of sale stuff


Thanks to the many of you who responded regarding my bill of sale question.

I'm not sure that things would always go as smoothly as I had the luck
to experience, but here were my experiences, just for the record.   This
was all regarding the purchase of my '74 Thing for $500.

1.  I was lacking a bill of sale.  The AAA did not ask for one.

2.  I had the pink slip with the previous owner releasing interest in
    the vehicle, but he had failed to list and sign the odometer reading.
    AAA let me write in the miles myself, and didn't ask for a signature
    from the previous owner.

This all may have had to do with the age of the car.  I understand that
they can be a lot more picky with newer cars, especially after '85.  

By the way, I did have a valid smog report and certificate to present
them.  AND the pink slip I had was not for junk/salvage, but a regular
valid title, and still current at that.

For some complicated reasons, I registered this 5 weeks after the previous
owner signed off, so I had to pay some penalty, but it wasn't much.  At
the same time I transferred ownership, paid sales tax, doc fees, paid
one year ahead, bought new license plates, new registration, interest,
all necessary fees, and penalties, and the total bill was $111.   I'm
supposed to receive my new pink slip in the mail withing 2-3 weeks.  All
in all, I didn't think this was much hassle, or THAT expensive, considering
the tardiness, and the things missing.  This may all have been due
to the fact that I went to AAA, rather than DMV.

Also, I learned something.  I had thought that any parking tickets were
liened against the car, but the AAA woman informed me that they follow
the previous owner.  In this case there weren't any, so it was a moot point.

Thanks, all of you, for all the help!
