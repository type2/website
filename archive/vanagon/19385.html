_______________________________________________________________________________
It looks like Winnebago has created a really slick motorhome with the 
Eurovan's front end on it.

Has anyone seen or heard about this unit.  If it runs the stock EV 
engine it has got to be &gt;&gt;WAY&lt;&lt; underpowered!

Pretty cool though!

   I never liked Vanagons much... until I saw my first Eurovan...
