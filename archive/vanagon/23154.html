&gt;I think what you're talking about is a vehicle made from a brand-new German
&gt;Messerschmidt fighter plane fuselage.  Seems that there were a lot of 'em
&gt;left over after WWII, lacking wings, engine, tail, etc.  Someone apparently
&gt;decided to make use of them and turned out a number of very strange-looking
&gt;three-wheeled cars.  The passenger sits behind the driver.
&gt;
&gt;The lead character in the film &quot;Brazil&quot; drives one (to go with all of the
&gt;other goofy-looking technological marvels in the movie).  I can't remember
&gt;what they're called but I saw a couple of them in Austin (one of them was
&gt;for sale at a gas station).  I believe that there's a club for owners of
&gt;this funny aminal.

Yesterday in Windsor Ontario (across from Dee-troit) they had the annual
Willistead Car Show. People around here are nuts about restorations. There
were several cars that were very reminiscent to me of my Army days in
Darmstadt Germany (1957):

        BMW Isetta (two seats side by side, door opens forward, standard
joke about parking up against the wall and not being able to find reverse,
four small wheels, the rear wheels very close together);
        Messerschmidt (two passengers, one behind the other, two small
wheels forward, one behind);
        Janus (two passengers, one in front, one in back, but they sit
back-to-back, hence the name Janus as in January (remember your Roman
mythology?));
        Lloyd, a standard four-wheeler but very small.

My brand-new 1957 VW Deluxe (baby blue) was a medium-sized car in those days.

In 1968 I went to Prague (shortly after the ousting of Dubcek: a very sad
city). At the time they vehicle to resident ratio was about the same as it
is today in Havana. But talk about weird cars: Tatra, with the rear V-8
(the Czechs loved to lend them to Nazis, who would then kill themselves on
windy road thanks to the tremendous oversteer); some kind of a
three-wheeled motorcycle vehicle like the Messerschmidt, but covered with
leather; old pre-war Skodas and a wild assortment of other pre-war vehicles
still in good preservation.

They're all gone now; Prague rolls on the used cars of Germany. Too bad for
the nostalgia quotient.
