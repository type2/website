Today I got some goodies I ordered from Wolfsburg West.
I got some master cylinder reservoir sealing rings, a center brake light
lens, pedal seals, and engine lid hinge seal.  I _ordered_ 2 engine lid hinge
seals and 2 pedal seals, and _got_ 1 engine lid hinge seals and 3 pedal selas.
AArrrgh!

I also got a brake m/c plug.

I'd also ordered hinges and a license plate light, but they were backordered,
so I said forget it, so they are sending me a check.  Turns out they _did_
have the hinges, but only _german_ ones.  Nobody told methat, and it wasn't
in the catalogue, so now I have to turn around and do it all over again...
