Subject: &lt;syncro&gt; bits needed/misc

Hi folks,

 I _need_ a difflock switch+knob from the dash panel, infact I'd take the
whole panel as a spare.  Anyone got/seen one cheap.  My front locker is set
up to come on with the rear one presently. :) Not real desirable for
steering.  Also would like a spare vacumm box for the diff, the one that I
have is now epoxied together. 


I _really_ need a dead viscous coupler for dissassembly/autopsy...  the
rebuild plan is not going any further until I get one!  I don't know if VW
gives a corecharge on these or if they are throwaways.  I'll cover postage,
they are heavy. It does look like mine has been rebuilt BTW.  The units are
balanced with welded on weights, and mine shows some old welding scars from
past weights being removed.  

FYI, the Audi power door locks work via vacuum servos, but they are only
single sided.  Audi has an air pump that must reverse to push/pull.  The vac
hose is suitable salvage, pull it out from the trunk latch, gives 2 x 4'
lengths and nice spare rubber hose bits too. Perhaps the entire Audi system
(pump+servos) would do in a pinch.

I've built one trailer hitch for a friends '89 Syncro Westy with the plastic
bumpers. PITA compared to the steel ones. It goes straight through the
bumper at midline, a slot like below about 1&quot; high by 6&quot; wide is needed.
Get the jigsaw!

Doing a drop hitch under bumper would've meant cutting larger chunk off
bottom lip/curve.  It is a detachable flat bar type, sticks out about 2.5&quot;
but has nice Reese cover over it when bar is out. Working on a 3500lb 2&quot;
drawbar for myself now, again straight out the mid bumper to preserve
departure angle.
        Those who asked for hitches, please be patient, I'm still
'experimenting' at my expense :(.  I still have your e-mails.  Thule hitch
mount bike racks are avail to fit flat bar, 1.25&quot; and 2&quot; square receivers.
My preference is for the lower profile flat bar type, limited to about 2000
lb. trailers (ie. plenty). 1.25&quot; goes to 3500lbs BTW. 

bye, Tim


PS: reply direct if wanted, I'm reading via Skips page, not the list.
