listees,

i have been a vanagon owner for 5 months, and a list subscriber for a
couple of weeks.  and for what i have seen this is the most appropriate
place to ask a couple of questions:

is there a place other than the dealer where i can find a new pair of the
hydraulic cylinders that keep the rear hatch open ?  what type would you
recommend; original or aftermarket ?

also, the front windshield whiper fluid reservoir has a major leak.  i may
need to replace/reconnect the hose or the reservoir, or both.   what's the
best way to access it ?

yes, i'm saving to buy a bentley manual.

thanks for your help.
