Well, ah hate to be cynical and all.  And I understand that some
of us are tryin' to do the best we can with the given system.  Recycling
and holden on to our cars as long as possible.  But... the only real
way you can put any kind of dent in the dealers/salesman/goverment system
is to turn you back on them completely.  That would mean giving up not
only your VW, but your TV/Cable connection (if you have it), your home,
your grocery stores, your CD player/collection, your PC and any other kind 
of consumer item you can think of.  So as long as you keep buying they've
got us all by the short and curlys.  It's only varying degrees of how much
your willing to give up and put up with.  

I do the best I can, but it's tough, real tough.  

I apologize for the wet blanket.  Don't stop trying.
