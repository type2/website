Subject: Re: Who sells VW mechanics overalls?

I have a pair that I got at the Good Guys show in Vallejo last spring (not
for sale).  SInce I got mine, I have seen others for sale at other shows on
the east coast, like Manassas.  If you can wait til show season, someone will
probably have them for sale.  Don't know who sells them but they must have a
pile of the considering I have seen them on both coasts last show season.
