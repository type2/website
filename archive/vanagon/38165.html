Subject:       Backing plates for a '72

I really really need rear brake backing plates for my '72.  I have 
been in contact with some of you over the past few months and so far 
no one has let me know what they want for em.  Here is the deal 
again.  I am in south east michigan,  the 48170 area code.  If anyone 
on the list has a set of backing plates for a '72 bus in good 
condition, please let me know how much you want TOTAL parts and 
shipping.
thanks.
ED.
