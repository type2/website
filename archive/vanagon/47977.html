Hello John,
You are powerhouse loaded with all these technical goodies( I mean knowledge)
If we all banded together and inputted all these consumer and road use
info to VW, they would probably be able to market the ideal camper
vehicle in the US again!. The point is whether their management are
assertive listeners and can grab these info and use it, especially its
free and assummingly untainted from any &quot;Detroit&quot; bias.
All we list members want is some appreciation from VW, e.g 50% discount
for any original parts purchased to repair our &quot;frequently in need of 
service&quot; Vanagon.
		Is this suggestion or idea too absurd ?
						TT
