You volks are tremendous.  Where else would the collective intelligence
be so high that I'd be able to piece together all of the following.  Five
starts to Jim Bryant for ALL the lyrics, complete, and thanks to
to the rest of you for your interpretive comments.  

Ode To Billie Joe by Bobby Gentry

It was the 3rd of June, another sleepy, dusty delta day.
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was bailin' hay.
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat.
And Mama hollered at the back door &quot;Y'all remember to wipe your feet.&quot;
And then she said &quot;I got some news this morning from Choctaw Ridge.
Today Billie Joe McAlister jumped off the Tallahachee Bridge.&quot;

Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
&quot;Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits please.
There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow.&quot;
And Mama said &quot;It was a shame about Billie Joe anyhow.
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge,
And now Billie Joe McAlister's jumped off the Tallahachee Bridge.&quot;

Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carol County picture show,
And wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night.
I'll have another piece of apple pie, ya know it don't seem right.
I saw him yesterday at the saw mill up on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahachee Bridge.

Mama said to me, girl what's happened to your appetite
I been cooking all morning and you haven't touched a single bite.
That nice young preacher Brother Taylor stopped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh by the way,
He said he saw a girl who looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwing something off the Tallahachee Bridge.

A year has come and gone since we heard the news about Billie Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo.
There was a virus going  round, Papa caught it and he died last spring,
And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything.
And me, I spend a lot of time picking flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And throwin' em into the muddy waters off the Tallahachee Bridge.

Comments about the mystery of the song:

1.  I always surmised it was a body.  Why?  I dunno.
