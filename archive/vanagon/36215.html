Subject: Factory Fuel Injection

Anybody out there Know about factory fuel injection on my 1800cc
Type IV engine?

The car is not getting fuel.  Could this be the fuel pump relay?
Where is it located?

Also, should I just trash the injection system and buy carbs?

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks

See ya
