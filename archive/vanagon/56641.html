Subject: Roof-racks+Mudflaps

Mucho thanks to all those who responded to my question about roof racks
for the Westfalia! I'll probably be going with the Thule system that
attaches to the rain gutters. This way won't allow me to raise the roof
with the racks on the vehicle but I'll mostly be carring the canoe to
lakes and rivers in the area where I live.

	Car Racks Direct - Seems like a good place to purchase racks for any
kind of vehicle. URL: http://www.outdoorsports_dot_com/systems.htm
They replied to my original message. They know their stuff. My hometown
VW dealer was not helpful.

	Next Question: How about easy-fit mudflaps? The VW dealer ones are
expensive. Heard of any other ones? Maybe something from a different
 car that work? I'd like not to have to drill a lot of holes.

					Thanks,

							John Falconer
