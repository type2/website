&gt;&gt;     2. I'm betting that wear of the Nylon slides is the reason my windows 
&gt;&gt;     sound like the dreaded &quot;fingernails-on-chalkboard&quot; when I open and 
&gt;&gt;     close them.  Garth seemed to intimate that the required number of 
&gt;&gt;     these thingies is 8 per vehicle; true?
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;Ditto.  My wife wanted me to ask the list if anyone had any brilliant
&gt;suggestions for getting rid of this hideous sound.  I thought of WD40 but
&gt;over time it will attract a great deal of dust and dirt.  Any other
&gt;suggestions out there?

I am fairly certain that the sound comes from the plastic edge running
vertically up between the windows, and *not* the track that the window
slides in.  I don't think that you would want to add any sort of lubricant
to this, as it would smear on the window when you slid it back and forth.
