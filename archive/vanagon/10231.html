Do you have new bushings? (big rubber donuts that go on the torsion bar on
either side of the spring plate - need four)

On those bolts - I bought some extra-extra-long bolts of the same thread
and used those to get it snug, then replaced them with the originals for
final torqueing.

Otherness:

Sears makes a nice magnetic-bottomed gravity-aligned inclinometer.  Less
than $20US.

Don't overadjust!  One full spline will give you the tallest bus on earth,
with the spring plate riding the lower stops while at rest...
