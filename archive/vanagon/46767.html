I hate to see it go!!!!!
I have purchased a 1991 and must sell my 1986.
 
 
  VW '86 Westfalia 200K mi $6,900/OBO Greensboro, NC 
     

	Options:
      	Air conditioning - works great (new compressor - last summer)
      	Cassette deck (factory rebuilt - fall 1994)
     	5th Seat option (like new - never used)
     	Manual transmission w/ clutch 160K
     	New Heads installed last week  (I didn't know I was going to buy
1991)
	Installed new front rotors at 150K
	Bentley manual included
	Tires - over 25000 remaining
	Driven everyday plus weekends

	Description:
	White w/tan interior, full Westy Equipment

	Needs to make perfect:
	New rubber around top
	Install radio antenna (included)
	
	This is one of the nicest westy's I have seen, I bought the van with
70,000 miles  	and have enjoyed all 130,000 I have put on it.  All
equipment works (stove, sink, 	fridge, etc.) and I feel it is ready for
many miles of enjoyment.

	Day phone      :  1 800 288 6363
