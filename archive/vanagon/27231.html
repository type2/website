Subject: Re: Clear Coat..Good/Bad?

In a message dated 95-10-19 22:19:28 EDT, you write:

&gt;What about clear coats...the guys at ONE DAY say that is eventually 
&gt;causes a haze...I think it makes the paint look wet/glossy.  Any thoughts?

I had a couple of VW K70's (precursor to the Jetta) in Germany in '82...One
was a '73, the other a '74...They both had clear coat, and they both looked
great, even at 7-8 yrs. old.  My '84 Jetta also had clear coat, and it looked
great until I sold it in '93.  The Gray Ghost ('88 Vanagon GL) has clear
coat, and it still looks great, although I've had a little chipping (of just
the clear stuff) from around the front wipers.

If you take care of it, hand-wash it, and use non-abrasive waxes, I think
you'll be fine (provided they a decent product is used in the first place).
