I dunno about them there vanagon critters, but you do on a '68-'71.  The 
frame horns from earlier years aren't there.  The manual sez chain it up; 
I just use a bottle jack.  Makes it a hassle to move the car while the 
engine's out, of course.  I always end up having to tweak the 
bell-housing-end's height on reinstall, anyway.

BTW I apologize to Gerry and the list for my rather off-topic 
&quot;Potty-Mouths&quot; rant.  It just seemed to me that wild-eyed free speech 
goes hand in hand with the sort of ruffians that tend to own vw vans -- 
but that's no excuse for trolling.  Sorry.
