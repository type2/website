Subject: Re: VW America denies recall

My experience with VW America has not been a &quot;joy&quot; either.  When my 78 Bus
lost the rear oil galley plug(popped out, thus losing all the oil) the
engine was wasted.  When I talked with the VW people about this design
problem, they said that since the engine had  a 100k that it was not their
problem.

Latter I had problems with my 85 sliding door not closing all the way.
Bringing up the national recall on this problem, VW said  &quot;OH yes, we will
fix this condition for you.&quot;  The customer service rep noted that the repair
had been completed by the previous  owner, but &quot;if it is the same problem,
we will fix again at VW&quot;s expense.  When I brought it to the local dealer,
they told me they would half to get approval from VW to do the repair work.
When I called VW of America back, their tune had changed.  Now they stated
&quot;that since the repair had been already been done once, VW of America is not
responsible for additional repair work.&quot;  When I reminded the rep, that he
had already promised to take care of the problem, there was a long silence
and then a denial that he had ever promised to take care of things for me.  
        When I asked to talk to a supervisor, the person I got told me that
the service rep I delt with would never have promise service.  When I asked
to speak to someone higher, I was informed that was no one higher at VW I
could talk to.

This was my experience with VW of America.

Gee, will I buy a new VW next time?
