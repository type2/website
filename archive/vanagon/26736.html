&gt; Second tip, if anyone does decide to go up into Sequoia, e-mail me and
&gt;     I will dig up the directions to a wonderful, one/two lane road that
&gt;     ran from the Grant Grove area back down to the valley. It is on some
&gt;     maps, but not all.  4wd not required, but no Winnebagos, either.

Speaking of Winnebagos, has anyone seen the Rialta model which is based on
the Eurovan?  What did you think of it?
