Subject: Late T2 steering box into earlier bus?
Date: Mon, 10 Oct 1994 14:27:25 +0100 (MET DST)

My 70 steering box is fairly knackered. I did eventually find
a replacement at a volks meet, but that turned out to be even worse.
Basically the 68-70 boxes are getting hard to find, but the 71- type
seem to be more plentiful and thus cheaper. 

So can I put the later box into my bus, or more to the point
what mods will be needed to do this? 

Thanx in advance

Marcus
