True, but a 6-8x drive is not cheap.  A 2x will deliver data faster
than a T-1 can transmit it, and it's quite reasonable for such an
application.  Besides, you can get a 7-cd changer with a 2x drive in
it for between $130 and $150.  Poof, you just effectively put seven
drives on line at one time.  As always, faster is better, but it's not
necessarily the economically-practical thing to do.

If anyone cares to continue the discussion of web-server technology,
feel free to send me private email -- it doesn't have a lot to do with
VWs, really....
