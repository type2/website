&gt; Subject:       '85 Vanagon woes...

&gt; For the 6 years I have owned my 85 GL Vanagon, it has from time to
&gt; time decided to leave me stranded by not restarting.  The usual
&gt; symptom is that it simply will not restart after being stopped (when
&gt; warm).  Each time I take it to the dealer, it restarts for them
&gt; (because it has sat for a few days), and they have never been able
&gt; to figure it out.  Once it even would not start in their driveway,
&gt; but they still failed to figure it out.  Last summer it died in the
&gt; Oregon desert, this summer it died in the Nevada desert.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had a similar problem, and been able to determine the
&gt; cause-
&gt; 
&gt; I'd love to keep the car, but my family is getting tired of rides in
&gt; tow-trucks.

Mark,

This happened to me in my '78. The cause was a bit of rubber hose in 
the fuel pump that would sometimes get stuck in the rotor, jamming 
the pump. Next time it happens, check to see if the pump is running 
and pumping. (Is pumping rubber anything like pumping iron?)
