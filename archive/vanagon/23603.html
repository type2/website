I agree with Angel

I think we should allow the water-cooled people to stay.  Since their
vehicles are so much more dependable than our air-cooled antiques I forget
they're here most of the time.  If we drove them into the electronic
wilderness to set up a new camp it just wouldn't be the same, not seeing
signatures like:

 'Wilbur 
  '89 Eurobomb
   2,434,381.1 miles and NO repairs.  Original tires, too.

Seeing stuff like that sort of inspires me.  Gives me a goal to shoot for.
 Or at.  :-)

One list is best.  We need to keep an eye on those fellers.
