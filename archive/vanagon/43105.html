EA&gt; anyway: what's this about a porsche water cooled six
EA&gt; i guess i better start saving now?

Might just be cheaper to see if Oettinger still makes their
watercooled 6 which they did put in Syncro's likely without
even changing the gas tank.  Probably quit making it back with
the reorganization of the company after the bankruptcy of
the early 90's though.  I got a picture of this conversion BTW
that 6 cly cast aluminum intake plenum looks REAL COOL.
