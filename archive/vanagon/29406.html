Subject: RE: CA buses for sale in the SF Examiner


&gt;I was bored at work today, so I started looking at the paper that was
&gt;laying there.  I couldn't find the comics, so I read what was there, the
&gt;classified ads.  I was going to bring it home and post the interesting
&gt;ones, but I forgot, so I'll recount the ones I remember.  There were
&gt;probably over 20 advertised.
&gt;
&gt;'93 Eurovan Westy, $18,500
&gt;'65 crewcab, $3200 (I'd gladly trade my '66 and '72 for this)
&gt;A couple '90 Westys in the $10k+ range, I think one was $19k
&gt;
&gt;Sorry I don't have phone numbers and stuff.  I don't subscribe to the
&gt;examiner.


Aaaaiiiieeeeeee!!!!!  Classified Addus Interruptus!!!    :-O
