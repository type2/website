Subject: RE: fuel line stoppers


&gt;Pencils are in the Idiots Guide as the fuel line plug of choice.
&gt;I have been using golf tees with good success for many years.  Good Luck.

Hmmm, wood is porous, paint is likely dissolved by gasoline, lead
tips can break off if stressed, and most pencils aren't even round...

Normally I like Muir, but he musta had a bad day while writing that
procedure.
