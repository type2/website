If I remember correctly, among survivors of the bombings there were 
astronomical  cancer and birth defect rates.  And just think about all 
the people who could have been assisted with funds which were used to 
build up a nuclear  arsenal which is capable of destroying the planet 
many times over. Not to mention the Reagan-Bush national debt growth.
