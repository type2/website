Mark,

Thanks for the offer but I'm still unsure what I'm looking for. Right now 
I'm still trying to determine what exactly it is that I want/need (2WD, 4WD, 
Westie) to get me to mountain bike races in New England this coming summer 
(loading up the '91 Golf can be quite the trick with  bikes, a passenger or 
two, and misc bike and camping gear)!

Enjoy your trip to New Mexico!

Paul
