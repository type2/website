Subject:  Re: Synchro Crew Cab

&gt;A few years ago I saw an ad for a Synchro Crew Cab pickup and wondered if
&gt;anyone else has heard of this and if it was ever imported into the U.S.  I
&gt;think the ad appeared in a Northern California nickel want ad type
&gt;publication.
&gt;


well,  a friend of mine has a synchro crewcab,  and he thinks it's just the
greatest.   It came from Canada.
