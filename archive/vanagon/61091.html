Subject: '87 Syncro Starter Woes

I'm new to Vanagons....we just acquired an '87 Syncro GL this week.  The 
starter needs some work and I am eager to get at it.  Just one question:  
How do you remove the starter?  I don't have any repair manuals yet, and 
I worked for about 4 hours trying to remove the thing with no luck.  Any 
advice is much appreciatied. 

TIA,

Sean and Susan
