&gt;When I open the big sliding side door on the '80 V6anagon, I tug down
&gt;on the lever, of course. But, sometimes the handle goes down but nothing
&gt;else happens. The rear edge of the door SHOULD pop out an inch or so,
&gt;allowing the door to slide back. But sometimes it doesn't pop out, and
&gt;so the door goes nowhere. You have to wedge your fingers into the crack
&gt;at the back of the door and pull it out, and then the door slides
&gt;normally.
&gt;
&gt;What's wrong with this picture? Is there supposed to be a spring or
&gt;something that pops the door out at the back edge, an inch or two?
&gt;Maybe this spring is worn or broken? Please let me pick your brains
&gt;for nuggets of priceless knowledge, before I rush in where angels
&gt;fear to tread, and take it apart just to find out what's wrong.
&gt;
On my '71, I believe there's two springs on the hinge (middle of the door,
rear, outside).  When this happened on mine, it was a large coil spring
that's hidden inside the part of the hinge that fits inside the door.  I
think there's four screws that hold the hinge to the door, so it's pretty
easy to take out, but you pretty much have to remove the door to get to
them.  (Not a BIG deal, really.)
