&gt; What are current prices for buses of this vintage, in moderate shape?

71 campers seem to be in the $1500 range.  Can't comment on the 66.
&gt; 
&gt; Friends of mine say the '71 was the best year built, easy to work on, cheap
&gt; engine, dual port, front disks, do others agree?

Absolutely.  Yo flend velly wise...

&gt; Is there anything good or bad about the '66 year that stands out (It's the
&gt; one I like and my wife has always wanted a pickup).

I like it cause it was made the same year I was.  On the other hand, I
think the cutoff for smog checks in Calif. is 65 - someone correct me if
I'm wrong.  Oh, I didn't check where you're from so this may not apply
to you.  :)

&gt; How hard are parts to get for these, things like rubber door gaskets, etc.

There are several places that sell them (Bus Boys, J.C. Whitney) if you
have the $$ to invest.

&gt; Anything special I should look for with these that John Muir didn't take
&gt; into account.   Rick

Watch out for rust.  Rust is the *hardest* thing to fix.  Engine and interior
work are trivial by comparison.
