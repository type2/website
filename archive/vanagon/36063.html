Subject: Windshield replacement

Hello All


I am going to look at a 1986 Vanagon GL tommorrow morning. The windshield has a 
crack in it so it has to be replaced.  I understand that there are places that 
will repair the windshield at your home or place of work.  Has anyone had this 
done and does it seal as well as the original. Also was there a recall for the 
rear heater cores leaking, someone told me that there was. 

This vehicle has a rebuilt motor from Volkswagen of Canada?  Does any know about 
this??  I was wondewring what else I should look for in this model 


OH the tranny has 150,000 mile so it.  Will the one from my 1984 Vanagon fit 
into it ok BTH both are a automatic??

Thanks Folks,

PaulC
