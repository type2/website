Subject: 23-Windows and Room for More

Did the deal.  The Bus is, as expected, very rusty.  In fact the right- 
rear corner is hanging by a thread.  It does, however, have most of the 
pieces.  I didn't dig around in it much -- we just drove there, traded the 
tranny and brought back a signed piece of paper and some undeveloped film.  
All the glass is there (one side window is cracked), the Deluxe dash pieces 
intact (white steering wheel w/Wolfsburg Crest button, chrome ashtray, 
clock, and a radio w/good knobs), the front seats are good, and the sunroof 
mechanism is intact.  The middle is full of &quot;stuff&quot;, but on the top of 
the pile is a gas heater.  I will actually bring it home next weekend and 
dig deeper.
  
The PO has a sideline VW repair shop, but primarily builds rail buggies.  
There were a few Beetles scattered around (one a cloth-sunroofed Baja), 
a 412 Wagon and a '68 Panel Bus.  The Panel is my next rescue mission.  
It is currently being used as a storage building, but the body is in very 
nice shape (only rust is down low on the nose).  I has no motor/tranny/rear 
drums or title, but is worth rescue as 2nd generation Panels are few and 
far between (and I just *love* Panel Busses [none of those silly windows 
to break up the beautiful lines]).  I'll try to trade him the '72 Bus I'm 
currently parting out plus some old heads, etc. that he may be able to 
use in his buggies.  More next week when I get the 23-Window home ...
