Subject: trip planner (URL-wwwsite)

I stumbled across a *commercial* trip planner service on the www  located
via  word search of
 &lt; an RV family&gt;   located at http://members.gnn_dot_com/RuffinItEZ/index.html

Kinda cool to see what is offered but costs real money (CC online) vs
looking in the darned atlas.
