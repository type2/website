Subject: Brain dead '87 HELP!!

Volks Folks,

The bad news is the problems I have been having with my '87 Vanagon have
slowly been getting worse.  The good news is it finally happend while I was
at my mechanic so it could be diagnosed.  The worse news is it appears to be
the computer.  8-(

If anyone out there in Vanagonland has or knows of a brain for a late '86
thru '9? Vanagon (Digifant) I desperately need one.  As always, less
expensive is more better.  I also have aircooled parts to trade...some of it
neat stuff too.

Any leads appreciated.  Please reply direct.

-Dan
