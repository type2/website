Yo,

Finally added Michael Heron's latest pix to the tent pages at:

http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/tents.html

The changes are on the nonwesty and privy pages.  Some 
rather cool old tent pix, including the cover of a Pop Mechanics from 
the 50's and some dudettes smokin' on the roof of a hatchtop westy.

I'll be off at a conference and then a-honeymooning in Barbados, 
tra-la.  Back 11/5.  Thanks to the well-wishers.  Rusty, my fiancee 
is asking me funny questions about you.

Dworkin sez his server twiddlings may cause unsuccessful page access 
sometime in the next coupla weeks.  Download them tent gifs now.

Later,
Joe
