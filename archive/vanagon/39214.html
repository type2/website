Subject: '78 Bus Rolling Chassis - Very Cheap or Trade

Just finished stripping my '78 sunroof bus.  Only thing left is 
body (rusty), sunroof, most windows, and everything underneath 
(suspension, good axle beam &amp; steering box, wheels, brake 
components, etc.).  (Trans is still in it, but I'm pulling that.)
Bus is in Philadelphia area.

If anyone can use what's left (above), and wants to tow away the 
rolling chassis (or pull what you want off it), make me a cheap 
offer or trade me for something you have lying around, and come
get it.
