Subject: GEX is on my sh*t list
Date: Mon, 11 Dec 1995 12:49:31 -0800 (PST)

The other day I got around to installing the spark plugs in my rebuilt
GEX heads.  The first one I install feels real loose as it is going in,
but tightens up okay.  The second one goes in about half a turn and gets
tight.  Real tight.  Looking at the threads I see they are in sorry
shape.  Don't know why I didn't notice it when I bought them.  I break
out the trusty thread-chaser graciously loaned to my by Dave Kautz
(thanks Dave!) and run it in a ways.  Meets some resistance, but after
that the spark plug screws in easily.  At least a little ways.  The
thread chaser can only go in about half way because the opening for the
spark plug hole is recessed, and the chaser is too wide to fit.  So I
just used it to its capability, and threaded the spark plug in slowly using
grease on the threads, backing it off every few turns.  It's still kind
of tight when it's almost all the way in.  I'm worried that if I use it
this way, it will strip the first time I try to remove the plug.  I'm
not too happy with GEX, but I'm not going to try and exchange the head
at this point.  I'm just going to use some anti-sieze on the plug and
hope for the best.  More to come...
