From: Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_lenti&gt;
Subject: Administrative Change

Due the the number of people on the list and the large volume of posts, 
(and due to requests from a few people) I'm changing the operation of 
the vanagon mailing list starting immediately.  The default destination for 
replies to messages sent to the list will now be the originator of the 
message and not the list.  This will cut down on &quot;Me Too&quot; posts and 
accidental posting back to the list when the intent was to send personal 
mail. It will also reduce the &quot;discussion&quot; aspect of the list, so if you 
want something to generate discussion, you will need to be explicit about 
replying to the list.

Any comments on this decision should go either to me or to the 
bit-bucket.  Please do not discuss it on the list itself.

Thnanks.
