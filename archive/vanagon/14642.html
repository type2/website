Subject: Almost-free bus sold

Hi, Dr. Lee...

Thank you for the tip on the &quot;almost-free&quot; bus. I went there and talked
to Paul, and the condition was pretty much as you described. He had
done a rebuild last, and it ran fine until the gland nut holding the 
flywheel loosened, and egged out the dowel holes in both the flywheel
and the crankshaft.

I have bought the bus from him, in as-is condition of course, and will
tow it home soon. Consider it saved! The body is not in bad shape aside
from the under-windshield rust (where have I seen that before?). Should
make a pretty good project. Spltting the case is the first order of 
business, then maybe some bodywork later. Know anyone who has a good
used flywheel and/or crank?

You mentioned you had some front seats that were OK. I'd like to look at
them sometime-- will call you soon. Do you have, or know of anyone who
has, the (short) middle seat for a 68-71 bus that goes behind the two
front seats?

Thanx again for the tip-- this bus has plenty of life left, with a little
TLC (and an engine rebuild).
