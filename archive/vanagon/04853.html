&gt; 
&gt; (Continued)
&gt;Hastily, in the 
&gt; darkness and rain, I convinced myself that the oil level on the dip-
&gt; stick was low, -- too low.
&gt; 
	Certainly understandable logic with little people on-board
	and Hell-like-weather........

&gt; Now, I KNEW that no mere mortal can read a water-cooled Vanagon oil
&gt; dipstick accurately unless he has let the vehicle sit overnight or 
&gt; has divine insight.

	Huh? Why's that?

  And, I KNEW that it was especially hard to read
&gt; in the darkness and rain that evening.  And I also KNEW that lots
&gt; things can cause the oil pressure light to come on besides low oil.
&gt; But, at the time and place, circumstances and fate would have it
&gt; that these things didn't matter.  I decided the van needed oil.
&gt; And not one quart, after checking the dipstick again -- but two.
&gt; 

	Your sin.......clean oil.

 
&gt; I could not tell where the smoke was coming from; my wife helpfully
&gt; observed that it came from &quot;everywhere in the back, and smelled like
&gt; a refinery&quot;.
		
		Thank you dear.......


&gt; We ate hot-pockets and fudge bars at the Circle-K while waiting for
&gt; the tow truck to come. 

	Mmmmmmmmm yummy....

&gt; Everything was A-OK.  
&gt; Not once did the oil pressure light come on.  So, the following
&gt; morning we gave the cat another tranquilizer and started out again.

	Were you tempted to pop a couple, yerself?


	Good story.
