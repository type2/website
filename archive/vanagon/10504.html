  Well along this thread, I am proud to announce that as of yesterday,
our very own Steven Dolan is the proud owner of my old lovely '67 Westfalia.
After a few minor things (new engine, brakes, paint, etc) I know he will
have a lovely mobile. Just goes to show that you CAN get some practical
use from this list! Isn't this technology thing wonderful??? So anyway,
that leaves us each with a '78 and a '67, which balances nicely, along
with the fact that I got my '67 in Washington D.C. , and he came here
from there to get his. See, a great cosmic balance has been achieved...
