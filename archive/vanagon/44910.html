&lt;&lt; Does anyone have an air conditioner on an '85 (or so) Westfalia they 
 are happy with? &gt;&gt;

Joe, 
I LOVE the AC in my 85 Westy.  I aim the two vents in the back together and
slightly towards the roof.  The cold air blows over the rear seat occupants
heads and directly to the front seats.  There is just enough air to cool of
the rear area.

I live in Northern Virginia and temp get to about 95 or 100 during the
summer.  Never had a problem in the past 4 years.  The only problem (very
recent) is the front heater works well, too.  I can't turn the damn thing
off.  So, I've got the AC fighting the front heater core.  Gotta figure this
one out.

Oh, yeah, I run my AC every month wether its hot or cold out.  I even run it
in the winter to keep the comperssor lubricated with the oil thats in the
freon.  I do the same with the heaters.  Every year, I have the AC checked
and serviced by an AC shop.  Cost about $25 to have it done during the winter
months.
