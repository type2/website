Subject: Volvo 6cyl motors

&gt;I have been reading posting here on and off for the past few months.  Great
&gt;stories about engine swapping.  Has anyone considered using a Volvo V6.  They
&gt;had a 2.7-2.8 liter motor in their Volvo 260 from the late 70's into the late
&gt;80's.  There has got to be a pretty good supply of them here in the states.
&gt; They run on Bosch Jetronic-K CIS fuel injection.  I think they were rated at
&gt;about 125 HP.  The only bad thing I can think of about them is that they are
&gt;actually of Renault/Citreon manufacture.  I saw a rusty 260 in the sunday
&gt;paper for about $500  'runs good, but very rusty'
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have any comments on what would be necessary on a conversion like
&gt;this?

I don't know how hard the conversion would be, but these are not engines
are not considered to be very long-term, unlike say the B20/B23 series. At
least according to the Volvo people I talk to occasionally - I also have an
'old' 244 so I stay in touch with the other V world too. (Maybe I should
sell my Honda scooter and get a Vespa so that all my vehicles can start
with V?)
