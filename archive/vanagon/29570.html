&gt; Prior to today I have seen 2  Waserbox Westies in area (1) '87 GL Camper 
&gt; with 74k miles in amazing shape at $10,000 and an 87 GL Camper with 34k 
&gt; miles at $12,000.  Neither has been sold but those were the only prices 
&gt; the owners were willing to part at.   I have been thinking that the 2.1 
&gt; engine, 1986+ Westies would be a great vehicle and (because I need heat 
&gt; up here in Valley Forge) I have avoided the air-cooled campers.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I saw a 1985 Westfalia GL with 38,000 original  miles on it for 
&gt; $8,600 outside Philadelphia at a VW dealer.  

Okay, since I haven't seen anything from the other yahoos still digesting
their turkey, I'll put in a word or two.  The '87's you spoke of don't
sound too far out of line, but it really depends on whether or not they've
had the infamous head gasket problem yet.  I'm not sure if it is inevitable
for them or not.  All statistics up to this point seem to say that it will
happen and that is a ~ $2,000 difference in the price right there.  No 
matter which vehicle you go for, you should ask for the paperwork for
any repairs on them and check them over.  If no paperwork is to be offered,
then pass on the vehicle.  And DO NOT take their word for it.  It's easy
to fall in love with these beasties and over-look the bad.  It's your
money.  

As inviting as the '85 sounds, I'd steer clear of it simply because
it's at a dealers lot.  I just don't trust them.  They have a profit
to consider that a private party does not.  And the mark up on the
'85 sounds like it's $1,000 or $2,000 too high.  My guess is that it
has had the head leaking coolant and they did the cheapo bottle fix
for it.  Buy from a private party.  They, at least, won't be looking
for the kind of profit a dealer does.
