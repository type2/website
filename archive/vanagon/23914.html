Subject:      Re: Death to VW Vandals

  There is definitely a VW karma force at work. A friend's father
  pulled into our driveway recently in his big Caddy, took one
  look at the Frau and called her &quot;Hitler's Revenge&quot; (we were
  changing her oil). *The very next day* his big hunk of Detroit
  steel gave it up and need $800 worth of repairs to get him
  home to Ohio. How sweet it is.

  My condolences to your bus, Brad, may the repairs be easy
  and cheap.

  ps: a friend in town had &quot;f**k you&quot; etched
      into the back of his pink '66 Kombi this
      summer by some jackass...mean people suck.
