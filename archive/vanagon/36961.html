Subject:       easy C.clip trick for c.v.s'

I recently replaced my c.v. joints.  I had a hell of a time with the 
c clips since no one sells c clip spreaders.  Then i had this 
wonderful brainstorm.  I just bought a $10 craftsman set of snap ring 
plyers and ground the out side of the largest set of teeth flat.  If 
you take this set up and come at the rings at a 180 degree angle, 
removing and installing c clips is sooooooo easy.  Don't even bother 
with the two screw drivers thing, I just ended up stabbing myself and 
bending the clips.
just thought you should know.
Ed.
