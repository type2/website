&gt; Hi all!  I found a '79 Westy in good condition, no body

&gt; does (I was in sort of a rush).  What would be a reasonable
&gt; price for this?  I went to the store to check out the N.A.D.A.
&gt; book, but that's exactly what I found, Nada.  It only goes
&gt; back to the early Vanagons, no bread loafs and no camper options.
&gt; I'd be interested in a range much like they do in that book, ie.
&gt; Low Price, Average, High.  I want to make a fair offer, but being 
&gt; a student I can't be tooooo extravegent with the ol' budget.
&gt; Any help is appreciated especially if someone has a recent copy 
&gt; of NADA that includes the bread loaves.  Thanks.

Ken, go to your local library.  I am sure even College Station has one. 
N.A.D.A. has a book on older vehicles.  Perhaps you may find what you want
in there..
