&gt;i believe in some countries in europe, when parking on the street, parking
&gt;lights live up to their name.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hmmm, I thought they were called that, because when you pull into an
apartment parking lot at night, you kill the headlights so as not to
illuminate that amorous couple in the 1st floor bedroom over there,
thru their lace curtains... but you can still see where *you* are going
while parking...
