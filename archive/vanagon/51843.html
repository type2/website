Are you serious????????

The stupidity of that line of thinking should force all 'free thinking' 
beings (or plainly - any being that thinks at all) to boycott Wal-Mart.

Due to Wal-Mart's new sensoship policy they will no longer be offering
cupholders that have ties to VW campers. A company spokesperson says VW
OEM style cupholders reflect on the past days in which VW campers
symbalized drug use and free thinking. Everyone will have to go to
K-mart.
