&gt;...The later model vanagons,...[snip]...are closer in design to Ben Pon's

&gt;aquarium on wheels (in German, &quot;wasserboxer&quot;)...[snip]..
&gt;Now if only I knew what &quot;todd&quot; meant. (could Todd Bridges, famous for his
&gt;stint on Diff'rent Strokes have something to do with it?...)

Aha! This is where Barry gives himself away!

&quot;todd&quot; is an arcane reference to the &quot;wasserboxer,&quot; as follows:
     todd--&gt;Todd Bridges--&gt;Lloyd Bridges--&gt;Sea Hunt--&gt;SeaQuarium--&gt;wasserboxer

Barry is NOT a newby, but apparently a VW insider, privy to the lesser known
secrets of the Pon archives held at Wolfsburg. He may be, in fact, be an
operative searching for the scurrilous knaves who infiltrated the Shrine of
St. Pon last year and spirited away the only known record of the &quot;Visions of
St. Pon.&quot;  No one outside of &quot;le Cirque d'Interieur&quot; would have known about
the contents of the &quot;Visions.&quot;  (The group was cleverly named in French, as
this would be the least likely name for a group of German fanatics, and
thereby excellent cover for the covert recovery operations.)

Ryan, they've drawn you out.  You've blown your cover.  They knew the
superior intellects who snatched the &quot;Visions&quot; were also too arrogant to be
able to resist responding to the apparently innocent query from &quot;Barry&quot; [if
that is indeed his real name].  Expect visitors soon who may want to ask you
lots of questions.  I suggest you consult alt.legal.nonextradition.Germany
immediately and convert all your assets to cash.

Elementary inductive reasoning. Or is that deductive? I'm not sure. This is
all so confusing.  Have to go now -- I think it's medication time. Why do
all the jackets here have such long sleeves?
