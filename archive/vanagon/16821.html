        Joel:
        
        In Tennessee, any place selling oil changes is REQUIRED to accept 
        oil for recycling at no charge.  There is also a .10 per quart 
        surcharge on oil to cover the cost of recovery.  Sounds like a 
        tax to me but it has forced a bunch of good ol' boys to quit 
        dumping the juices from the huge tired pickup trucks down the 
        street drain or in the wooded lot behind my house.  Never argue 
        with a set of bib overalls who loves his huntin' dog more than 
        his wife.  After all, his family once starred in the movie 
        Deliverance.
        
        I get the bus back by Friday.  It started with the heads but 
        ended being much more, including pistons and a clutch.  After 
        pulling the heads, I realized that this was more than I could 
        handle (educated beyond my intelligence) so I had to get the 
        local VW diety to work his magic.  Details to follow when I'm 
        finally driving it again.
