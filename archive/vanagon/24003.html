Subject: i wanna compile a list of reliable parts dealers

hey now,

my experience with vw partsplace has left me steaming...and i want to do
something about it. has anyone ever compiled a list of the reliable mail order
vw parts dealers before? i realize mistakes will happen (he he i'm a
distribution support agent for ibm) but i keep hearing and hearing about
vw parts place.

maybe folks can send me or post to the list about their experiences with
various mail order companies?

jonathan
