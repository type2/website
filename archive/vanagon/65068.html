&lt;&lt; I'll be at a workshop in Greenbelt, Maryland, next week.  Does anyone
 know of a salvage yard near D.C. where I could browse for Vanagon parts?

 Please let me know at cwyatt_at_gi.alaska_dot_edu&gt;&gt;

if you could cc: me on that posting, I'd be much obliged.

BTW: do you think there's a newsgroup for folks who own AMC Gremlins/Pacers?,
