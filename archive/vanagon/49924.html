&gt; Anyhow. OEM is vinyl coated steel, and is $220!!  And in typical VW style..
&gt; the newer plastic pipe is not backwards compatible!!  SO, off to the muffler
&gt; shop I go, (called all FLAPS for hose that diam: NA)   Anyone see any
&gt; corrosion/other probs using galvalume muffler pipe in stead of OEM or
&gt; rubber? Reply ASAP, this will be a done deal by the end of the day.  many

    Tim ,
     Is this the pipe that runs from the water pump to the thermostat?
     I need to replace mine. I think I will have it made out of 
     stainless steel. There is a shop here in PGH. PA that will 
     make it cheap. The flange and weld is the only problem I see!
