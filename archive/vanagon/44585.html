Subject: Re: Diesel opines

I had always wondered why a curve would have a sign posted that said &quot;40
mph&quot;. It was obvious that my car could make the curve at 60 mph with ease.
Then I bought my first westy, a 78.  Then it became clear.  Someone had
posted these signs just for us breadloafers.

I bought a NEW '83 BMW 325i. I drove it for 3 years and put 30k miles on it.
I bought the Westy for a camping trip to Canada in '86.  The BMW never came
out of the garage again. I sold it for $1500 in 1995 with the same 30k miles
on it. I sold the '78 in 1991.  I bought a '86 Westy Wasserboxer.  I was
taking it to Germany and wanted the heat.  I still drive the '86 Westy
today, and plan to die driving it.  I love it.  It is me.

I can't say anything about the diesel engine.  BTW, I have 100k on the '86
now. I know that I am going to have head problems.  Is it better to repair
the heads, buy a long block, or do a complete rebuild?  What will be the cost.

&gt;My father is considering buying his first vanagon--an '81 diesel &quot;partial

&gt;with the slow lane before making the decision. In the interest of fairness,
&gt;though, I told him I'd ask the list for some more opinions (I guaranteed him
&gt;we'd have a lot to share), both pro and con, about the wisdom of this
&gt;purchase. So, here's your chance to influence a VW virgin--what does anyone
&gt;have to say about '81s or diesels or both, or about the vanagon experience
&gt;in general? (I have done what I can to sell him on VW, but I'm a breadloafer
&gt;myself, and can't attest to the virtues of the brick firsthand...)
