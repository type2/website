&gt; it must be something about like fascination follows function.  you have to
&gt; admit: the vw bus is not the prettiest, or the most powerful, or the
&gt; 'snazziest' or really any kind of -est.  rather homely, as a matter of fact.


	Homely....Hell, I get all sorts of positive comments about Ruby's looks.

&gt; 
&gt; so why do so many people of such varying ages and occupations like them?
&gt; beats me. i'm just glad they made them. :)

	I think it partly has to do with the weeny-sized engines. Brickheads
	feel less like road hogs (as opposed to Detroit-Iron drivers).

	Also, prior to the wasserboxer, one's engine could be coming apart
	at its' seams and still spin. Thus, popular with poor folk (students)
	as I was.

	But, for me, it's sitting over the front wheel that I dig.
