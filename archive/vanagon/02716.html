Canoes on Type 2s...or was it Tipacanoe and Youllsinktoo..

When I owned the late, lamented 67 camper, I used to carry around
a 13' Great Canadian fiberglass canoe. One of the neat things
about carrying the canoe was you could use it as an &quot;aerodynamic&quot;
luggage box. We would strap things into the canoe using bungee
cords and some plastic netting and then toss the canoe on
the roof rack.
