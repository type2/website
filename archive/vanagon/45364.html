Subject: try again: Re: '64 Deluxe Engine #? 

I checked the number on the motor currently in my '64 Deluxe with that on 
the warranty card (found in the Service Booklet).  The book shows engine 
# 0301353 and the current motor is # 0590821.  I assume that this is the 
&quot;G&quot; series 1500 (there is no &quot;G&quot; stamped on the case).

in 64 the motor, whether the usual 40hp 1200, or the optional 1500, did not
come with a letter before the number.   the 1500s had a six digit number,
where the 1200s had a seven digit number.  In aug 65, with the 1500 as
standard, the case was stamped with an H.   does your bus have a &quot;1500&quot;
chrome emblem on the back engine lid?  or on the space between the engine lid
and rear hatch?

0 301 353 -  ~ early sept 63

0 590 821 -  ~ early june 64

what is your chassis number?


I'm curious as to the date of manufacture of this motor (and question why 
it is in such a low mileage Bus).  It could be that the PO used the 
previous motor to drive an external generator (or other contraption) and 
put a few too many &quot;hours&quot; on it.  There are about 16 holes in the floor 
above the motor and a manual throttle cable (handle mounted to the parcel 
shelf) along with the double pully and slot for the belt up through the 
floor.  It also has what I think is a rev-limiter or governor mounted 
under the 28-PICT carb.  It has the markings APG, Made in W. Germany, 28 
DR 1,5 on the face plate.

im more surprised to find an original motor than otherwise, no matter how low
the milage.    I was amazed to find that my 69 bug came with the original
(needing rebuild) motor.   people could (can) kill them in a few years, no
problem.    especially with the funky generator set up you described.  oh,
and yes the bus would have come with a governer to prevent overrevving.

hope this helps
