Subject: Re: Sheesh? Duct Tape? BTDT

&gt;| I shall continue to yank the grill in late November, stuff the intake with
&gt;| foam, cover over with &quot;riggers tape&quot; AKA &quot;Gaffers Tape&quot; and leave it until
&gt;| the poppies bloom.

	The true wonders of gaf tape should be experienced by those who
currently worship in the House of Duct... The adhesive is pressure sensitive
and does not melt onto your cables and the like. Plus it's black and the
exterior is clothlike so you can paint it... But at $7 a 100 yard roll (I
think they are 100 yard rolls), it is a bit more pricy...
