Subject: Re: 12-point tool


&gt;Take $20, go find a Snap-On truck and get the tool from them.  It will last 

&gt;forever, which is probably longer than you need, but more than that it will 

&gt;not break under the van, so your knuckles, your blood pressure and your 
kid's
&gt;ears will all be safe, and you won't have to swear, crawl out, clean up, go
&gt;to
&gt;FLAPS, get another cheap tool, come back, crawl under, break it again,
&gt;swear....
&gt;
&gt;Snap-On.  Just do it.  Ordinarily I don't buy tools from Snap-On because 
I'm
&gt;not a pro mechanic relying on his tools all day every day, but for this
&gt;particular application I recommend them without reservation.


My '69 bus had hex socket-head bolts holding its CVs on. When I replaced
one, couldn't get them loose, so clamped my vice grips on the end of the
cheapo allen wrench I was using. SNAP.

So, went to Sears and got a Craftsman allen wrench of the appropriate
size. No more problems, then or later, vice grips or no vice grips.
I don't know if Sears has the 12-point tool or not-- call them.

Craftsman allen wrenches are great. But I've broken three Craftsman
screwdrivers, usually while trying to pry things loose with them *after*
using them to hotwire various automobiles and getting that nasty
electric-arc burn on the tip. Sears replaced them free, cheerfully,
no questions asked, each time (I went to different Sears stores-- why
push your luck).    :^)
