Hey, Thanks Joel!

I've been needing to replace mine for a long time (bumped the noggin 
too many times now), but the VWoA price of around $100 pair (+tax) 
made me hesitate. The place you posted has the original German 
shocks for $29 ea. With tax and shipping the total is $67. What a 
deal! I just ordered a pair.
