&gt; The problem is SEVERE black smoke when more than 3/4 throttle is applied.
&gt; (We're talking james bond smokescreen here)


Hi Robert.  Having the injection pump checked is a good start... you 
don't want that baby to go!  If it's calibrated correctly, I would 
suspect the injectors.  Black smoke is unburned fuel, if too much 
fuel is being sent to the combustion chambers, it'll spit it out.  
The spray pattern of the injectors is critical for correct burn.  
Also, check your fuel and air filters.  Both crucial to life of a 
diesel.  

What fuel are you burning?  Have you changed fuel in the last while?  
If the smoke is excessive, it could even by a lack of proper engine 
compression as well.  You might want to try an injector cleaner for 
diesels as well.  BG makes a product called DieselMax.  It's 
excellent at cleaning the injectors, and varnish from the pump.  One 
can is for 55 gallons (or something as horrendous) of fuel... use it 
straight up for one full tank in your van.  I have a diesel Golf, and 
do this twice a year.  Haven't had any problems with the engine yet.

Hope this helps,
Harry.
