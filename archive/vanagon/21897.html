Subject: Oil Splatters in Engine Compartment
Date: Tue, 1 Aug 1995 06:51:20 -0700 (PDT)

Hi,

	When I got home from work yesterday, I noticed the bus was dripping 
oil, so I opened the engine lid to find oil splattered all over the back (FIF)
part of the engine compartment! It was concentrated around the crank pulley
area.

	A friend of mine from down the street sez &quot;looks like you blew a seal&quot;
and I said &quot;help me fix the damn thing, and keep my private life out of this!&quot;

	Anyway, I cleaned up the mess, and took it for a another drive, and
didn't see any more oil.

	Can this be caused by over-revving?  It was hot yesterdday, I was really
cookin' down 80 (I actually passed a bunch of cars!)

	I've never had a motor do this one before, so any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thom
