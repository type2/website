Don't think this will help, just an excuse to pass along an 
observation I made in my '80 Westi while crawling around underneath.

The mounting bolts for the propane unit have siblings on the 
passenger side.  If you need additional propane, there is a place to 
mount another one, with bolts in the right place.  Don't know about a 
non-Westi.

&gt; A friend of mine needs a propane tank complete with valves for his 76 Westy.  He
&gt; wants to mount it on the driver's side.  I do not know if this is standard
&gt; location or not.  He has modified the bus so maybe he has to mount it there.
&gt; Will a vanagon unit fit there?
