The following is meant as information to help any on the Vanagon List who
thinks they might want an inverter (110 Volt power from their van).

&gt;Chris, 
&gt;
&gt;After much investigating I have determined that these inverters are
excellent values. I have decided to get the PC 1500, which has a surge
capaciy to 3,000 watts. This is enough to run our 110 volt air compressors
by the way.
&gt;
&gt;All three inverters seem to have a nice modified sine wave output and they
are much more compact than Tripp Lite models. (Also, many Tripp Lite models
are square wave--ugh!). They are very similar to the ProWatt models which
are also more money (in photos they look nearly identical). 
&gt;
&gt;If you think you're going to want to get one eventually, then buy one now
through CUC. The first price given is the CUC price.
&gt;
&gt;PC140     $29     ($65 at All Electronics closeout catalog)
&gt;PC300     $55     ($69 at Danmark catalog; $129 at All Electronics closeout
catalog) 
&gt;PC600   $158     ($199 in Danmark catalog; $279 in All Electronics closeout
catalog))
&gt;PC1500 $358     ($449 in Danmark catalog; $595 for ProWatt equivalent in
discount Camper's Choice catalog)
&gt;
&gt;All models list the &quot;continous&quot; rating. Multiply this by 66% for a
realistic figure. (I made up 66%; it has no basis in fact.) Double the
rating of these units to obtain the &quot;transient&quot; or &quot;surge&quot; rating. 
&gt;
&gt;Manufacturer is Focus Industries, now going by the Power-To-Go brand name,
distributed by Clearline Concepts of which the corporate owner is HSN Mktg,
which has no relation to Home Shopping Network. For information you can call
201-402-5243.
&gt;
&gt;The prices above *include* shipping and taxes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to NYC.
&gt;
&gt;The CUC phone number is 1-800-835-7467. Join up for $1 but be sure to
cancel your membership in 90 days or less to avoid the CUC membership fee of
around $40 to $50. You can elect to do as I do and join and cancel CUC
continuously to avoid this fee and yet maintain a CUC membership.
