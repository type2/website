 Ok, I have seen so far a few people interested. George Washington's
Birthday weekend seems to be the time of choice. This is Friday Feb. 17
through possibly Monday, Feb. 20. Those interested would I suppose meet
Friday afternoon/evening, and others join when possible. Sorry to bother
those who have already replied yes, but please, let's get a sort of
final count and idea of times people could arrive. ( I will probably get
there Friday early afternoon, and remember, the gate closes at 6) Also,
should we dare to try a communal eating set-up?any ideas/volunteers for
that? Anyone bringing kids/dogs/guitars/anything else?  I am not much of
an organizer, so I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot. Please do respond, even
if you have already. Thank you all and have a lovely day. I have included
below all the information about the location, the Jordan Lake State Park.

&gt;   So, there is ONE park open now, it is the Jordan Lake State Park. It
&gt; is on highway 64, around Apex, N.C. which is actually closer to D.C, and
&gt; around the same from the South.
&gt;   They have 100 spaces available now, 6 people per space (as many
&gt; vehicles as you can fit! ) and it's $9.00 for a regular space, and
&gt; $14.00 for a space with a power hook-up (this is per space, not per
&gt; person) The park gates are open 8 am - 6 pm, and the number for all
&gt; wishing further details is 1-919-362-0586. This is the park office, open
&gt; 9-5. As Isaid, this is on a lake, with trails to hike, etc. I have talked
&gt; to several people that have been there, and they all said it was nice.
