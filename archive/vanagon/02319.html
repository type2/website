Jerry, I replaced mine back in April.  I was able to order them from
my local VW dealer (919-493-7411, Durham NC) with no problem.  I believe 
they were around $7 for the pair.  I'll see if I can find the receipt 
when I get home tonight.  I have no idea if the local dealer above will
ship parts. If they don't I would be willing to order another set and mail
them to you.
