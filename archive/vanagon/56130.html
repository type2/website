&gt;  They make a viscous coupler just like

&gt;GM's Blazer/Jimmy/Olds Bravda all are available with the same system as the
Syncros, viscous coupling &amp; all;  they are AWD's that run as rear wheel
drive with up to 90% of engine power available to the front wheels when
necessary (although locking diff's are not available - only a posi in the
rear as an option).
