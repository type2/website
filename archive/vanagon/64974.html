Blain,
Does it really matter if its DOT3 or 4?  I have 3 in my van and haven't
noticed anything wrong.  Should I be using DOT4?  How come?  :-)

     This has generated a lot of traffic.  I need to apologize somewhat for
     perhaps promulgating another Internet &quot;apocryphal&quot; tale.  A few weeks
     ago there was some traffic on the Vanagon list about DOT 4 being the
     required brake fluid; since there wasn't much discussion at the time,
     I took it as the gospel.  The service guy at the local non-dealer VW
     repair also concurred.

     Turns out that the owners manual (which I didn't have at the time) and
     the Bentley book (which I did have) both indicate that DOT3 or DOT 4
     may be used.  Some listies agreed that the additional resilience of
     the DOT 4 was worth having.

     Meanwhile, I changed mine out (it needed it) and &quot;installed&quot; Castrol
     DOT 4.  Bleeding the system was a gold-plated b*tch, and it's still
     not 100%.  I was getting air out of the back brakes long after I
     expected (pretty much ran an entire quart through it).  I'm beginning
     to suspect that the piston for the rear circuit is drawing air and
     that it may be time for a new master cylinder.  Who was selling these
     for $100?

     BTW, can anyone explain the Bentley instruction to &quot;flip the lever on
     the pressure regulator towards the rear of the car&quot; before bleeding?
     And why does it never instruct you to &quot;flip it back&quot;?  Does this even
     apply to the '91?

     TIA
