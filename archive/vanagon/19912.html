Subject: Dealers and the American Way



To All:

Speaking as a mechanic, the preditations of dealers (and mechanics) on car
owners has kept pace with the systemic dumbing of America.  Here in
California automotive interests bribed our elected officials to gut the
automotive division of the Office of Consumer Affairs; we now have two (!)
investigators to handle complaints.  The population of California is about
30,000,000.

The bribes were all legal, of course -- campaign contributions and the like.
 And the official word is that the staff reductions are part of a State-wide
economy move.  Besides (the legislators argue), the State office duplicated
the functions of various city and county offices.  Sure they did.

When we have a headache we don't think of cancer, we pop a couple of asperins
and the pain goes away.  Until the next time.  But the problem of dishonest
dealers and mechanics is only a symptom, the disease is more subtle and far
more pervasive.   Unless the root problem is dealt with, complaints, civil
suits and letters to the editor are about as effective as treating cancer
with asperin.

One reason I own older Volkswagens is because I can maintain them forever, no
dealers required.  I would rather have the work done by an honest, courteous
dealer but I haven't run into one of those in more than twenty years.  If my
family is to enjoy the benefits of personal transportation I feel I've no
choice but to become my own mechanic.  (Lucky for me I are one.)  

I would also like to own a newer car but it doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out that the fair market value of the typical new car is from 67%
to 73% of its price, according to Kelly's Blue Book.  And insurance companies
use the same kind of creative accounting, having one evaluation to calculate
your insurance rates, another when settling a claim.  This is 'good
business.'  It is taught in our business schools and its sharpest
practitioners receive million dollar salaries and are celebrated in numerous
Man of the Year awards.  But it is neither fair nor ethical.  With the bulk
of Americans mechanically challanged with changing a flat tire, their options
in personal transportation are limited to a choice between cancer and polio.
   

Up to this point a lot of people -- possibly a majority -- will agree with
me, offering a verbal pat on the back for being the last of the red-blooded
Americans with greasy fingernails.  But that misses the basic message, which
is simply that the system doesn't work.  And what lies ahead is definitely
dangerous territory.  

I'm also prepared to shoot mad dogs and kill my own burglars.  This is not a
Rambo-esque choice, it is a requirement for the security of my family since
our hi-tech mega-buck public safety system has an average response time of
about thirty minutes, if they show up at all.  Our courts have ruled that
public safety organizations are not obligated to respond to any specific
call, only that they provide a uniform level of response to the public as a
whole.  So everyone please note:  Wandering around my property at night may
be hazardous to your health.  

Far fewer Americans will agree with this latter position, but for the area in
which I live it is as valid as the need to do my own auto repairs and for the
same reason:  The system doesn't work.  The only question is, how long before
this situation becomes the accepted norm for a majority of Americans?
