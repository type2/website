Subject: VW micromachines!

Just visiting a local Bradlees I finally found the VW set of 
Micromachines.  For those not familiar, these are very small toy cars 
that come in packs of five.  I'd been looking for a number of months, 
ever since my friend informed me of thier existence.  The set includes:  
A Bug, Bug convertible, Karmen Ghia, Rabbit convertible, and a split 
screen bus.  I'm not sure of the year (im a Vanagon guy;)) But it has a 
sunroof and the corner rear windows (23 windows?)
Just thought someone would want to know...
