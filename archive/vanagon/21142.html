Subject: propane fridge for 78' Westfalia

Hi All.

Has anyone converted their 79' or below Westfalia fridge to run on  
propane instead of 12VDC?  I think the American conversions are easier  
to convert because the fridge (ice box?) was an upright type, but what  
of the Westfalia where the fridge opens from the top?  I'm sick of  
relying on an additional cooler w/ice for trips longer than a weekend.

Thanks,

Dick Myers
