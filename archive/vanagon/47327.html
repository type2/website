Subject: RE: CBC Radio Interview...

&gt;Hi Everyone.  I taped Christa Ovenell's  interview with the CBC Radio 
&gt;that aired yesterday morning.  This is the interview about all the VW 
&gt;vans going to Inuvik this summer.  It was a pretty good plug for 
&gt;travelling in VW's, and the &quot;community&quot; one belongs to while owning 
&gt;these vehicles.  It is about 15 minutes long.
&gt;
I also have a tape of the CBC Morningside interview, taped for my by a
friend in Vancouver, if anyone in the USA wants a copy of the tape I could
probably make copies and avoid the higher postage...
