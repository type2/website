Subject: '97 Eurovan Camper

While camping this weekend at Chincoteague VA we spotted a new VW camper
near our site.  We approached it and a couple from N.J. was just having
breakfast.  This, they explained, was their first trip and were just
learning how to work everything.  We asked where they bought it and they
said a dealer in NJ had just started selling them.  I thought you
couldn't buy one in this country (?)  We were supposed to go back later
in the day for a tour but they were pulling out as we were coming back
from a side trip.  The only thing I did learn was that they are 6 cyl.
(engine in the front?) Otherwise, I wasn't too impressed with the
outside.  I thought it looked like a tall Dodge Caravan and I really
didn't like the idea of not having side windows in the &quot;way-back&quot; and
the scaled down openings in the middle side windows.  Maybe I'm just a
traditionalist but...
Can anyone tell me about the inside of these things - are ther any big
design changes?  What do they go for now? Does anyone know of a web site
with pictures &amp; discriptions?  
Thanks in advance for any info.
By the way, you who live in the DelMaVa area really have some beautiful
sights to see!
