Subject: Re: so that's what it was!

&gt; 
&gt; Postscript: my '91 does not have the illconceived dash light and she is
&gt; nearing her 90k milestone, I really love her too so how do I know when the
&gt; o2 sensor actually does need attending to?
&gt; 
 
You know this has had me wondering as of course the '90 has no OXS 
light either.  I noticed this as I was going to change instrument 
pods from '85 to '90 (weird old coot who owned the '90 painted the 
bezels WHITE?) before I realized I could change only the bezel part.  
Why no light on the later ones.  Of course, I'd still do the change 
regardless, it is an expensive heated sensor, but shit $100 won't 
break me.
