Well for example, last fall I sold my '76, dad bought the
car new in '77, it was in average+ condition, though had been
Zbarted, I had done body work, paint, new rubber, and the
catalyst for all this was dad replaced the engine with a
factory 2.0 at 65,000 or so, the bus had 7?000.  This had
always been a work bus and had a fair amount of damage/rust repair,
rockers and 1 corner, the rest was in fairly good shape
from the Z-bart.  With the nearly new engine, $500 worth
of rubber, and $500 worth of paint supplies, I got $2800
for her.  I really can't imagine over $4000 for a 77 if
totaly like new.  In fact the local bug guy, usually a total
ass has a '79 with a very nice interior, totaly solid NC body
that does need cosmetics, paint, and rubber, rebuilt 2.0,
and A/C unit inside but compressor missing, for $3000 I think
which I thought to be ludicrous by the time you did paint
and seals.  It has around 100k on it I believe, remember even
if well cared for at 75,000 or so a lot of things are going
to start needing attention, that have probably been put off.
