Subject: Re: Truly bonding with my Bus


I once was bonded with my bus. Back in my college days, I had my
67 camper (actually had it for even post-college days...until
Shithead made me sell it...), and I decided to replace the 
floormat with some linoleum. When I removed the floormat
I noticed a rust hole thru the floor. I got some glass cloth,
some resin and started working on the floor.

While I was working, I must have spilled the resin on the
floor, and my pant leg landed in the puddle...

Within a few minutes, I too was truly bonded with my bus!  ;-)
