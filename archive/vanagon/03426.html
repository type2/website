Back when I first got the '56 I threw a quick coat of paint on it. The
next day I went off to the Univ library.....as I was walking toward the
bug (about 20 feet away), the passenger in the Caddy parked next to the
bug opened the door...and dinged the bug.

I was pissed. The fellow in the Caddy said:  &quot;Don't worry 'bout it
brutah....its only a Volkswagen&quot;.....

I got in the bug...did a loooong &quot;Muir&quot; warm up...and when they
were out of sight, I reached under the seat, pulled out my trusty
Deer Slayer knife.....walked up to the front fender of the Caddy....

I dragged that sucker all the way to the back of the Caddy...I got
metal shavings...as I dragged the knife back I looked at the Caddy...
and said:

&quot;don't worry 'bout it brutah, its only a Cadillac!&quot;
