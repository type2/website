Subject: Fwd: Auxiliary heater

A VW Rabbit heater core is a close fit also.  Had to trim the plastic shroud
a bit, but it works fine.  The Rabbit core is metal, not aluminum and
plastic.

I replaced the rear bench seat heater core in my 85 Vanagon with a Ford
heater core the same size and used a plumbers in-line valve instead of the
factory replacement.  Cost:  $25.00 for the core and $0.85 for the valve.
 Just go into an auto parts store and have them bring out heater cores until
youfind one the same dimension (nearly) as yours.
