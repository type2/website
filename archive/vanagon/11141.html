&gt;&gt;They are also good for using in crawl spaces and attics!  
&gt;&gt;Be sure to bring protective goggles with you when you climb under the
&gt;&gt;car so the little particles falling off the cars underside won't get
&gt;&gt;in your eyes.

A frind got something into one of his eyes under his car and suffered a week
long struggling and finally went to see an eye doc. The doc told him if he
delayed further seeing him he might need a surgery. He took a tiny rusted 
piece of metal, part of exhaust tube, out of his eye. Good advice, Steve.
