Subject: steady oil light revisited

I still haven't changed the oil to 20W50 or put on an OEM filter 
(soon though), but I've been searching the archives.  From a summary 
of how the oil pressure system works:
 
http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg02115&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.
01

it says:

&quot;There does not appear to be a condition in a normally operating
monitoring system when the light should be on steady.&quot;

That's exactly what mine does.  Comes one steady (not flashing) and
no buzzer under 2000 RPM, meaning it's the .3bar sensor.  According
to Ron Salmon, there were 2 specs on sending units, but of course,
I'm not sure which one I have.  

So I've been pestering individuals about how to install a real 
pressure gauge.  :-)

We'll see how it goes after the oil/filter change.  In the meantime, 
I'll start saving for a rebuild, just in case.  :-o
