Subject: Re: AVP where are you?

Ken:

Talked to them last week - no problem.  I know they take lunch at
11:30 AM PT.  Are these the numbers you have?  (800) 548-5766 -or-
(916) 344-8999.  E-mail address is volks4_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com

Good luck!  I've had the same experience with BusBoys.  Finally
spend my $1000.00 + in parts elsewhere.
