&gt;Is there any way to deterine if a particular vehicle has or has not been
&gt;serviced for factory recalls? Does VWoA keep a database that they will
&gt;check for you?

yes, they do keep a database, and if you write them, they will check to see
if your bus has had the recalls applied.

the servicing dealer is also supposed to record the recall service in the
owner's maintenance book (or owner's manual) with a stamp. and a sticker is
supposed to be put on the car (in the front door jams somewhere).

&gt;Will VWoA perform free recall work only for original owners upon receipt of
&gt;recall letter?

depends on the type of recall. if it is a safety recall (one that the
government tells them to make), yes. if it's one that vw makes (like checking
the torque on the head bolts), most likely not.

all of this &quot;they ought to&quot; and &quot;they have to&quot; is widely variable from
dealer to dealer. :(

but you can get a list of recalls on your year bus by calling an 800 number
to NHTSA (in the u.s.) and they'll mail you a computer printout of the
recalls that they know about. they also mail you a post card that you can
fill out and mail (to vwoa), requesting info on your individual bus and its
recall status.
