Sierra? that's the one around here that is 'ecologoically safe for kids and
dogs' ... i.e., it's propylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol ... which
supposedly means it isn't poisonous to kids and dogs and cats. but it also
(supposedly) doesn't cool or protect against freezing quite as well. by that,
i mean that instead of -60 degrees for the good ole stuff, this new stuff
only protects down to -40. same kind of thing for heat: not quite as high.
but if you don't need it, ...

&gt;Also, the cooling system is supposed to hold just over 16 quarts;  16
&gt;quarts=4 gallons, so I bought 2 gallons of antifreeze.  Is this going to
&gt;be enough, or should I go back and get more?  Just wondering.

i heard 18 quarts or 2.25 gallons. one more bottle? :)
