Subject: 2nd Ottawa Pizza Night ?
Date: Thu, 1 Jun 1995 05:37:56 -0400 (EDT)

All you Ottawaians and even those of you who are close by and want to get
on board, I'm seeking a consensus for a 2nd Ottawa Pizza Night.  I've been
in recent comunication with David C. and he is ready so....... how about
the rest of you...... Markus, Ralph, ?, ?, ?.   You can respond to me so
as not to clog the list with useless dribble (useless for the others)
):-}{   Let's get the Vans and buses rounded up for a meet.  Another idea
would be to meet up at the VW show.  I don't know much about it except I
think it's coming up soon.  If anyone has more info on this please respond.

Cheers

Frank
