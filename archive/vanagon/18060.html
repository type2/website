Subject: Re: High Water Temp

A few comments:

1. If there is a small airleak in the coolant system, you will see your
temperature rise. Have you driven any stop &amp; go in hot weather yet? 
You would see the same symptom here as driving up a long hill.

I had a problem where the temp gauge would rise in stop &amp; go traffic. 
It started to occur just after I flushed the coolant. I found I had
created a small leak at a fitting where one of the larger hoses crosses
over the front (transmission side) of the engine. I replaced the clamp, 
bled the system and no problems since.

2.  Your temp gauge does seem to be a bit high. My gauge always stays
just at the point where the bottom edge is just kissing the top part
of the warning light.

The higher constant temp could be caused by an incorrect thermostat
or blockage in the radiator. 

How many miles on the Westy and was it very well maintained by the
previous owner?  A knowledgable, meticulous, previous owner probably 
would have fixed the problem with the higher constant temp.

3. Coolant.  Since you have checked the archives, you will notice *many*
coolant/head related postings.  I would always recommend to use *new*
Autobahn whenever radiator work is done. 

Good luck with diagnosing the problem.

&gt; My recently purchased '86 Westy is running well. I love to
&gt; drive it, and I'll never go back to tent camping. But it
&gt; does have one problem, on long gradual up hills the water
&gt; temperature gauge will go way over to the right and the
&gt; red warning light will blink. This has happened twice,
&gt; and both times I slowed from 60~65 to 55~60 and turned
&gt; the heat on. The temperature dropped and the light stopped
&gt; blinking. Also the gauge is normally to the right of the
&gt; red light, about 1/2 way between the light and the max temp
&gt; band. Is that normal?
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked around in the FAQ/archives and it seems to me
&gt; that I should have the thermostat replaced. Is that true?
&gt; I was thinking that I should have the radiator pulled, taken
&gt; to a radiator specialist, flushed and tested. Is this a 
&gt; good idea? I've talked to one shop and they said they could
&gt; do it but that they use recycled phosphate free antifreeze,
&gt; would this be OK or should I insist on the Autobahn stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
