&gt; Ned (Rothstein, I think) was asking about EV tire options.  I recently
&gt; bought a set of reinforced sidewall Michelin MXL 205/65R15 tires from NTW 
&gt; for approx. $90 each.  These replaced the original Goodyear G64 that 
&gt; wore very well (replaced at 49K) but had become quite noisy.  What a
&gt; difference in ride noise level.  If you go with NTW, you'll have to convince 
&gt; them that a reinforced sidewall MXL exists, and also wait a few days for 
&gt; them to order them.

Did the same switch myself.  I miss the Goodyears.  MUCH better traction 
from what I can tell in snow and mud.  Michelins though are cheaper.  
Where we are moving in real rural Virginia we need mud and snow traction.

I'll tell you Vanagon folks about the new property soon.  14 acres and 
&quot;free&quot; camping offers...

Its badness on my part that let the Goodyears wear out so fast - over 49k 
but worn because of neglecting to rotate enough.  rear tires got odd bar 
wear from &quot;bouncing&quot; the mostly empty light weight back end that made 
them quite noisy.  We got both kinds (one Goodyear died real early from 
road debris from an accident) from &quot;Just Tires&quot; cause they were handy...

The guy at &quot;&quot;Just Tires&quot; used to drive around a bay window bus - until 
last year I think.
