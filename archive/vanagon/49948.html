&gt; I'm back from vacation and still haven't sold the interior from that 
&gt; wrecked '85 Vanagon Westy GL that's been in my driveway since shortly 
&gt; before I left.  I posted this about 1-1/2 months ago, and thought I'd post 
&gt; it once more.  I wouldn't mind splitting the interior up IF I could sell 
&gt; most of it that way, but the only inquiries I got for separate parts were 
&gt; for the tables and other minor stuff like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Surely there must be a Vanagon owner out there who wants to upgrade to a 
&gt; full-blown Westy interior. I have just about everything behind the front 
&gt; seats - sofabed, stove, fridge, sink, cabinets, tables, curtains, etc.  
&gt; Fits any year Vanagon. Asking $675 complete. I'm in southeastern Pa. E-mail 
&gt; me directly for more info.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
