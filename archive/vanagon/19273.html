Concerning pulling trailers. I have pulled 3 sailboats, 2 Sunfish
and an M-16 with vacation gear (probably about 1200#) and 6 fairly
large people with more vacation junk with vans, '67, '74 , '91.
Ran 450 miles during the summer and never had a problem in 20
years. Take that back. I did have one case of vapor lock on the
'74 when we had to wait for a train and the engine was just too
hot. The '91 really purrs along at 65 with the a/c on. Of course
now we don't have 4 kids but we have put on a little weight.

Take it easy and don't stress anything and you will probably do
fine.
