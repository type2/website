&gt;&gt; is that short for Personal Computer,  or Portion Control?

Then Thom, The Growler, popped off with:
&gt;Grrr!  Don't get me started on portion control!  Damn Jenny Craig fascists!

what does Jenny Craig have to do with german cars?? does she drive a
Portion 911?? i think not... more likely a pink Cataract or maybe a
Wrinkled Continent.   :)

so how to you &quot;control&quot; them Portion cars, anyway?
