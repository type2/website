Subject: Replace Engine?

Hello everyone,
	I have an '86 Westy with 140K miles that has developed the dreaded
head gasket leak.  After looking through the archives it seems that there
are four options:
	1)  AlumaSeal/Bars Leak
	2)  Repair heads/Replace Gaskets (J.B. Weld)
	3)  Replace the heads/Gaskets
	4)  Replace engine
The main contingency is that I'm planning on driving down to Cabo San
Lucas at the tip of Baja.  I'm just guessing, but it seems that trouble
with the wasserboxer en mexico would be a major nightmare.  I also have
a %15 off coupon for the local VW dealer, which will bring the cost of a 
newly rebuilt engine to $1955.  I'm looking into replacing it myself as
I have time on my hands.  It seems as though replacing the engine may be 
easier than R&amp;R the heads.  At 140K miles is it just time to replace the 
engine?  Any comments greatly appreciated!
