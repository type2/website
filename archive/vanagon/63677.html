Harvey,
Sounds like a possible head leak to me...I had a similar problem a while
back. Does your cooling system pressurize prematurely (before it's warmed
up)? As mine didn't go through a lot of coolent, it was hard to diagnose.
Wasn't till I actually pulled the head that a definative cause was found.
Very minor gasket leak was the cause. Meanwhile, I drove it for over a
year...
Good luck,
Bob Bellanca

&gt; Could use some help on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; Been original owner of an '82 diesel vanagon, now at 179K miles.  Except
&gt; under a few very rare (and understandable) circumstances, it has never =
&gt; run
&gt; warmer than the temp needle at the left hand edge of the LED in the temp.
&gt; gauge.  Coupla weeks ago, wife noticed that at freeway speeds, it ran
&gt; warmer, at the right hand edge of the led, but cooled down if she slowed
&gt; down to say 50-55.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So - I ordered a new thermostat from VW, and had it installed with fresh
&gt; phosphate free antifreeze.  On the way home I noticed that the engine =
&gt; temp
&gt; now runs steady state at the right hand edge of the LED all the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Now - although this probably isn't &quot;overheat&quot; it is warmer than it has =
&gt; run
&gt; for the last 15 years.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that the electric radiator fan is an issue here, I don't
&gt; think the current temp is hot enough to trigger the fan, and the last =
&gt; time,
&gt; about a year ago stuck on a hot day in a traffic jam, I did hear it come
&gt; on, guess I could short the switch to verify, but the engine never ran =
&gt; hot
&gt; enough under nominal conditions (left hand edge of the LED) before to =
&gt; need
&gt; the fan.
&gt; 
&gt; Coolant was last changed 2 years ago, and looking at the coolant tanks,
&gt; showed no signs of rust in the cooling system.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
