 If I had $30,000 to spend on a new camper, I think I would get one from each
 air-cooled genre. I'd get a 67 westy with the little pop-top and hopefully
 a bench seat in front. I'd fix up my '74 so it looked and ran like new and
 I'd get an '82 with the non-deluxe camper that has the &quot;dining elbow&quot; and 
 seat belts for six. I think I've only spent 11-12K$ so far, so I would have
 GEX send me a spare engine and transmission for each of those, now I'm up to
 15K$. Sorry, I can't spend it all - I'd have to use the other 15K$ going 
 places in my buses &lt;a field trip to Unca Joel's library and possum kitchen 
 for starters?&gt;
