Subject: Re:  Programmable W/W VW too

Has anyone confirmed the following?

*** Start orignal message:

     The part# is: 1HM 955 531A, and it replaces the Audi part# 443 955
     531. This is used in most Audis from mid-80's on (maybe '87+?). The
     relay is in the fuse/relay box, next to the fuses, third from the
     front of the car. It is white, with a &quot;271&quot; stamped on the top in big
     numbers.

     The new one dropped right into my '89 100Q, and works as follows:

     1) turn wipers to &quot;intermittent&quot; (*not* mist) 2) turn off
     3) wait time interval you want
     4) turn back to intermittent, it will repeat that interval.

     Unquote

     Someone wanna check out the relay number in their Vanagon during lunch
     today (I drove the Audi) and report back to the group if this is a
     possibility?
