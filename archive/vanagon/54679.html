&gt; Basically, can you get to all of the connection points through the front
grill

&gt;  new hoses?

I don't know how to get to the entire hose, but I fixed a similar problem as
follows:

The kink in the hose was in the area right behind the squirter.  I removed
the squirter and the hose attached to it, while the other end of the hose
remained wherever it was.  Cut off about 1&quot; of kinked hose and re-attached
the remaining good hose to the new squirter and reinstalled.

Did I say NEW squirter?  Yes, you'll likely destroy the old one prying it
out, so buy a new one first.

Good luck,
