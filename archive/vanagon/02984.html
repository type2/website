You are right on all counts.  Try AMSOIL spin on filters that remove 1
micron particles as opposed to std FRAM and AC that remove 25 micron.
AMSOIL also has a bypass filter that essentially elminates the need to
change  oil. Many truckers never change their oil with this.  It costs
around $109 retail(you can get it for $89 as a dealer.  Call
715-393-7101 for a dealer near you or more info.
