&gt;When it is very cold I end up with a puddle of coolant under van after
&gt;driving.
&gt;The puddle is near driver's side of engine toward front of van.
&gt;Leak seems to be worst the colder it gets (-8 here this weekend).
&gt;Any ideas ??
&gt;Thanks Anthony

Sounds like external head gasket leaks.  Try using cooling system sealer.
