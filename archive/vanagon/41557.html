Subject: Choke!  *&amp;% Gasp! $162  EV Repair manual?
Date: Tue, 07 May 1996 18:25:36 GMT

Well, after being stranded once in Alabama and being stuck
for 3 hours because of lack of a diagram showing how the
serpentine belt is routed, as well as the need to do some
maintenance, I resolved to obtain a service manual to carry
with me in my 93 Eurovan.  A call to Bentley results in
learning that their version of the manual will not be out
until late this year.  

So, I called VW Tech Pubs to see if I could get a microfiche
version like the dealers use.  A very courteous young lady
helped me.  &quot;Sorry, its no longer available on fiche for
your year &amp; model.  We do have the dealer service manual
available in hardcopy, but its kind of expensive.&quot;

So, VW gets another $162 of my money and in ten days I'll
have a manual.  But, I guess I'll cheerfully pay that if it
means I can get rolling sooner or if it'll keep me from
stopping unexpectedly to begin with!
