Subject: heater assist kit

I was wondering if anyone has tried out one of those 
inline heater/defroster/defogger assist kits.  It is supposed to 
boost heating up by over 100 cfm and right now I think my heater puts 
out about two or three cfm.  I really need something that works, does 
anyone know of something better?
