Hal,

To answer your question on why I felt comfortable in putting non-Reinforced 
tires (namely the Blizzaks) on my EV, here's why:

1. According to the stuff on the sidewall, the rating for the tires is 1550 
lbs. The front axle load is approx 2800 lbs, and the rear load is 2200 lbs., 
therefore there is an approx. 300 lb load margin with the Blizzaks.

2. The majority of my driving during the winter using the EV is usually 
short hops...&lt;25 miles....as opposed to lots of long trips during the 
summer. When I need to do long distance driving during the winter, the 
Outback gets the nod.

Based on 1 &amp; 2 above, I felt comfortable with the Blizzaks.


As to the availability, I got mine from the local Firestone dealer. BTW 
Firestone has a deal whereby if you buy either a pair or a set of Blizzaks, 
they will change them over back to your summer tires w/a balance...change 
your summers over to Blizzaks w/balancing for the next four years free of 
charge.


Hope this answers your questions.

Ric
