Subject: RE: Insurance Industry Regulation (was RE: BUSES, VALUE &amp; RESALE)


&gt;&gt;&gt;Public Citizen, in Washington DC, the group founded by Ralph Nader, is 
very
&gt;&gt;&gt;active in lobbying government to control insurance company rates, etc.
&gt;&gt; Many
&gt;&gt;&gt;states have their own chapters of this organization.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;In Texas, it's called Texas Citizen Action, based in Austin and Ft. 
Worth.
&gt;&gt;&gt;They made a huge difference in the favor of consumers when Gov. Ann
&gt;&gt;Richards
&gt;&gt;&gt;appointed the head of Texas Citizen Action to head the Texas Board of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Insurance.  Since newly-elected Gov. Shrub Bush has been in office, he's
&gt;&gt;&gt;appointed white males from the insurance industry to the Texas Board of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Insurance and fired the consumer advocate, resulting in much higher rates
&gt;&gt;&gt;for the general public.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is this the first proven connection between genitalia, skin color, and
&gt;&gt;economics?
&gt;&gt;So the racists were right after all!   ;)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;..NOT
&gt;
&gt;No, just same as it ever was: the Good Ol' Boy system at work in Texas
&gt;government.  Really doesn't have that much to do with race or gender
&gt;
&gt;Costs me about 25% more per year SO FAR, and we're only into his first year
&gt;of office.


Makes me wonder about the insurance companie's profit/loss statements
before and after the elections; as well as the info on premiums taken
in vs. benefits paid out, for both periods. I have zero information on 
this--
makes it real tough to make any reasonable decisions, though some people
try anyway.

In other words, insurance co's are profit-making institutions, as any legit
business must be. But corrupt ones try to jazz it way up, creating 
situations
like you've described.

Any chance that government restrictions before the election, were so severe,
that even legit, clean companies could only lose money? I have no info on 
this
(do you, Cheese? How about sharing your stats with us?), but would sure like 

to find out-- if my rates were lower, I could afford that new engine for my 
'71!

How does one get this info, I wonder? (When pigs fly, if corruption is
that widespread, maybe?) Any suggestions, anyone?
