Subject: Westy Racks Available

G:
Please post if it's OK to mention business name and address.
I've seen cars/products advertised for sale on the list before. But wanted
to check with you before laying out there. Could we alter the msg to fit the
requirements of the list? Trying to behave ahead of time. Thanks! 
BTW: This post has not gone public only private to you.
