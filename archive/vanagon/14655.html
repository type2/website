My diesel Vanagon had, and I retained it after the swap, a plastic
&quot;housing/support&quot; that fits 'round the oil filter. Does this guy know the
story on this ?

&gt; I think they are worth it for another reason, however. They are so strong
&gt; they would protect the rear of your vanagon if it was hit by anything
&gt; smaller than a Mac truck semi. As you van stands now, the bumpers are
&gt; useless in a real accident, and major $$ is required to repair a Vanagon hit
&gt; from the rear. 

I have a pair of rabbit bumper mounts that my friend and I thought could
be modified to use on the van. They are spring? loaded and telescope. We
thought that they may be able to take up the shock of small impacts that
normally translate into dents with the stock rigid mounted set-up.
