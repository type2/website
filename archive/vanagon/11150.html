Add the following to the list from my collection:

VWUS EuroVan repair manual set

I have most of the manual set - donated by local VW dealer.



Russek T4 Pocket Repair Manual
&gt;From the UK, covers diesel 4&amp;5 cyl as well as 4 cyl gas. Unfortunately
does not have anything on 5 cylinder gas, but is still a wealth
of information for a VW product that does not have a Bentley 
manual.
