Subject: brake question

Hello Everyone,


I have a bit of a dilemma. My 83 wasserwesty has developed a brake problem
and I was wondering if anyone can field a few questions I have?

1. When I apply the brakes and hold the pedal down it very slowly sinks
toward the floor. I checked the fluid in the master cylinder and the level
hasn't moved. I checked the calipers and as much brake line as possible and
I can't find any leaks. The parking brake also suffers from this as is
doesn't engage until it is further from the floor than usual.

2. Can I just replace the fluid and bleed the brakes? Is bleeding the
brakes the same procedure as the clutch? I replaced the master and slave
cylinders about a month ago (thanks to the advice from the list). I didn't
bleed the brakes though. For some reason it didn't dawn on me that the
clean oil in the clutch will mix with the dirty oil in the brakes.

3. I read the warning on the brake fluid bottle and the &quot;costly repairs&quot;
part made me scared. It warns of corrosion in the brake system. Will having
this condition for one month cause this to happen?

Any info would be greatly appreciated.
