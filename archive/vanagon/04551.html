For what it worth I was told by VW Canada that a catalytic convertor would
cost $800 also. I ended buying from alocal place and got it for $150.00
CDN. Contact me if you want their address they may ship to the US. There was a
thread a while back on mufflers, on average Vanagon owners were paying
about 150 for the muffler itself. Keep in mind neither are hard do it
yourself jobs: the muffler tailpipe will unbolt from the muffler and the
muffler itself can be unbolted and hacksawed off from the exhaust pipe
with a clamp or weld in place. The real bugger is replacing the cast iron
components of the system because they are expensive and VW only parts,
so save your dough for those parts if and when they break.
