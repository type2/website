Subject:      Undercoating: Cool Patch or Something?

Volks,
Someone posted up a mention of an undercoating that is actually a roof
patching compound, water based. I lost the message (Western Digital spun
a bearing: sudden cardiac HD failure). I have searched throughout the
Houston Area roofing suppliers and can't find this brand. There is
something available here that sounds similar but it's white. Whoever
posted this up, where did you get that stuff?
