Ah yes, the age old shower config issue!
Mr. and Mrs. VanBondo found a great set up on our trip from Phoenix to the 
San Jose/Kelly Park meet in April. Don't shower for several days and then 
invite yourself to Martha's house at the last minute.

It works great!

Otherwise we take a &quot;liberated&quot; 5 gallon bottled water jug, a washcloth and 
a bar of soap. I think that without these options it is easy for VW bus 
owners to quickly look like Alannis Morrisette in braids and the Reverand 
Jim Ignatowski after a rough night. Sheesh, and some folks wonder why I 
always wear that broken down J.B. Stetson straw hat while on the road... 
Fashion statement? No, it just keeps the fleas down.  ;-)
