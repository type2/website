Subject: Is It Possible to Install Oil Filter on Autobox in'87 GL?

Does anyone know if if is possible to install an oil filter on a Vanagon 
automatic tranny? I have an '87GL and wish to do so as I always do on my 
USA/JAP applications and run synthetic and this works great in 
lengthening the service life. Any comments or feedback appreciated.
