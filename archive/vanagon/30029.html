	Well, 400,000 miles on my Jetta Diesel tells you something positive
about these engins.  I love them!  Yea, they are under powered, I never
broke any land speed records in my 71 1600 cc. camper tho.  I rode in a
friends camper diesel, and I find they have comparable power to a stock
1600 cc. SP. engine. If I could find a Diesel camper I would buy it.  On

&gt; neat.  I was told that they are very underpowered. Is this true...diesel
