So Bob J. said:

&gt; Does anybody have any reason why I shouldn't put one of these on my bus
&gt; motor?

Yes, i have. The pumps leak between pumpbody and case, they have flow problems
due to the small area in which their designers had to fit all the passages. If you
want to use one you could improve flow by re-shaping/smoothing the  corners in the
oil passages, at least, where you can get at them. For best performance you should
hard-anodize the pump body to assure a tight, leakfree fit in the case opening.
The pumps can not be used with a rear motor mount and or some exhaust systems.
If your case has the rear mount bosses you might need to clearance the left one
a little. It's nice not to have external oil lines but i'm getting more and more
convinced that they are a nessesity.
