Subject: Type 2 w/ Rabbit engines?

Hi, Gang!

Can anyone verify the following little snippet that I pulled off r.a.vw last
week from some poster in Belmont, MA? :

&gt;: Didn't anyone know? The VW dealer here in Belmont, MA has been selling 
&gt;: brand new Mexican Bugs for 2 months now! He's got em in three colors,

&gt;: warranty applies along with the 2 year free maintenance. He also plans 
&gt;: on bringing in new Type 2 Buses with Rabbit engines. Get one now!

Is this guy pulling our body parts?

Norman
