So Joel Walker says:
&gt; low already. :)  and the girls what do take the oil, well, they want only the
&gt; best ... none of this Uncle Bubba's Recycled Dino Surprise stuff. the best
&gt; impression can be made with a case of straight 30W High Detergent Valvoline.
&gt; :)  &lt;cause they've seen that name on the sides of racing cars&gt;
&gt; 

Hmmf... (looking down my nose with a snooty look)  And I thought that
Castrol 20w-50 was the Dom Perignon of engine oils...  ;)
