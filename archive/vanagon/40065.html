Check your timing and vacuum advance canister.  My vacuum advance
cannister went out and my bus ran like hell.  It surged, missed, sputtered
and everything.  Yours may be onit's way out, but not yet broken all the
way.  Just get a piece of clean vacuum hose, put it on the canister, and
suck on it (I know what you're thinking).  If the canister will hold a
vacuum, no problem, but if it doesn't, then change it.  They are about $15
at a junkyard, and can be changed in no time at all.  If you want advice
on how to change it, email me and I'll send some.
