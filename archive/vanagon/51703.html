Subject: Mudflap installation - any tips?
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 22:40:59 -0000

I bought some original VW mudflaps to put on my 1982 bus. This was because
road grime was getting all over both sliding doors in such a big way. Has
everyone else got mudflaps or do you put up with washing the bus every few
days?

Anyway, before I drill some holes in the lip of the wheel arch, do you have
any tips? I don't know what the end result should look like even. The
instructions indicate that the flat should be square in all dimensions (ie
vertical, horizontal or at right angles to the midline wherever possible).
But how low should the flaps hang down and how far should they stick out at
the side?
