Subject: reassemble on the tranny from long block?

Someone (I only remember the name of the bus, it was Das Boat :)
was saying they like doing the final assembly, from long-block on
out, with the engine in place.  My question is, will that work on
a newer bus.  I have an '81 Vanagon and I have to go in from
underneath, there's no access to the rear of the engine, really.

Does anyone have any other inventive ideas?  How do the rest of you
folks deal with reassembling these later-bus engines?
