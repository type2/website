Subject: Sources for VW Video, books, toys &amp; &quot;Herbie&quot; stuff


Classic Motorbooks
1-800-826-6600

Lots of VW repair manuals (bentley, haynes, etc.), restoration and
history books. Over they past three years they have added at least
3 new VW titles in every quarterly catalogue.  Great service...
if you can't delay gratitude like me...they can ship next day!


EWA &amp; Miniature Cars
1-800 EWA-4454
1-908-665-7814 - fax

Lots of obsucre (for the US anyway) die-cast and epoxy 1/43 scale
VW models. They carry the subscriptions for VolksWorld. Not as
many books in their list as Classic. They have some videos including
Love Bug stuff.


Melissa &amp; Jerry Jess
602-867-7672

Jerry is a Herbie freak. Owns four of the original cars used in the 
movies. He buys, sells and trades Herbie memborabilia.

They also have a great sellection in new and used toys, models,
literature and books, as well as stamps, pins, etc.


Maybe we can put together a list of various sources where we get our
parts, books, etc., from and make a FAQ list and publish it from
time to time,  avoiding the &quot;where do I get..&quot; syndrome?
