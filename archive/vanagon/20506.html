&gt; As far as the latches on splits, and late models I believe, you have to
&gt; PULL on it, as opposed to pushihg it, so there should be no danger of it
&gt; getting accidentally bumped. I seem to recall some early campers
&gt; actually had a knob attached to it, to pull it open. If you don't mind
&gt; cutting a small hole in that panel, it shouldn't be too hard to do, if
&gt; it is at all similar to the early latches.  At least check it out while
&gt; you are in there.
&gt; 
Yes, there is indeed a little plate which, when pulled, will open the door.
With all the hints of ways others have done this, I am beginning to formulate
my approach to the problem also.  I think it will be a lot like a long string
attached to the locking plate.
