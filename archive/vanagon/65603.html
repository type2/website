Yokohama Canada is a client of mine.  I called them on Friday to get the
latest on the availability of the Y370 LT tire for our busses.  Here are
the straight goods:

Yokohama Canada has no plans to discontinue the Y370 LT at this time.

I had spoken with someone at Yokohama Canada a few months ago who confirmed
the rumour that they were planning to discontinue these tires.  This is
certainly no longer the case.

These tires are readily available at most tire shops in my area.  If any
listees in the US want a source for these tires, there is a shop in town
that sells them for CA$87 per tire (US$62).  If anyone is interested I will
ask if they will ship to the US.
