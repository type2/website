&gt;boy. can you guys just imagine if we could DRIVE from, say, labrador to
&gt;greenland to iceland to norway or some such? just being able to drive a
&gt;car all the way to europe? :)  what a trip!

My 1972 bus was one of the first vehicles to actually drive overland across
the tundra to Labrador. This was in or about 1987. We were celebrities
up there.
