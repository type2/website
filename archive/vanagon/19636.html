Hello,

My name is Joerg and I have owned a 1982 VW
Camper Diesel (99k) for 6 years. Even though this is probably one of the
slowest vehicles on the road, I love it (I used to drive them for the
German postal service as a student).

I have three questions

1. I recently moved to Dallas and the Van doesn't have air-conditioning.
As far as I know, it is not possible to hook this engine up to an
air-conditioner. Does anybody have any information about this? Is there
any other way to do anything about this problem? What do our air-cooled
friends do in this country?

2. In Germany, there is a turbo-diesel version. Does anybody know of any
place in the U.S. that works on these things? Is it possible to get an
engine and/or the additional parts and where?

3. I'd like to here from other Vanagon-diesel owners, if possible. I
realize there are not that many out there.

Thanks so much,

Joerg
