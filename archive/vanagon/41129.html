Hey there!

Just wanted to say congrats to you.  Whether you took it in or not,
you did a rebuild, by yourself.  And if that's all that was wrong on
your first one, then I say alright!  And next time, that won't happen
(it'll probably be something else:)  About 8 months ago I was busless
and a mechanical idot.  Now I just own a bus, and at the end of June
I'll be attempting the same thing, and I really liked reading about
your updates, gives me a sense of &quot;maybe I can do it to!&quot;  So alright
to ya:)  

take care,
	brandy
