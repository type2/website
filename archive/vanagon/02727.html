The Twisted Mind of Uncle 'Curly' Joe cyfered:
&gt; 
&gt; HA! just for that, i'm gonna get RIGHT behind you and turn on ALL my
&gt; misaimed headlights, 7&quot; driving light, 7&quot; pencil beam light, and dual
&gt; 7&quot; fog lights. and if you get behind me, i'll turn on my red rear fog light
&gt; and my dash-switchable clear rear fog/backup light!!! ha!
&gt; 
&gt; take them photons and smoke 'em!

You haven't seen my deflector screen have ya?  You'll think the sun was
shinin' from my campers rear window. ;)

&gt; 
&gt; why the sudden interest in properly inflated spares? huh? :)

I'm not sure how to respond to this one.  The real reason is that I don't
want people dickin' with their damn tires on the bus tour.  Don't want
to be held up because somebody wants to get every last mile out of their
damn tires.

&gt; 
&gt; and isn't it past your bedtime?

If your referrin' to my lack of posts, I've had so much GD work to do
that the best I could do was lurk.  :(  I know I missed a great Friday
last week. GD all day meetings! :P  And there's still more on the way.
