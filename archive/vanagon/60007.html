&gt;&gt;I just replaced that pipe on my '87 last year. It IS a specific pipe and the
&gt;&gt;only place in the Mpls/St Paul area I could find it was VW.  It was $252
&gt;&gt;(thank goodness for the 15% VW Club discount!).  What Bently also doesn't tell
&gt;&gt;you is that you have to drop the skid plates to get the old pipe off and the
&gt;&gt;new one on.  Found that one out the hard way.

&gt;Is that where the skid rail can contact the exhaust if it's bent up?
&gt;I bent my skid frame again on a bad road and I think that the low
&gt;rumble that I hear now isn't a cracked exhaust, but the skid rail
&gt;contacting either the engine frame or an exhaust pipe; this has
&gt;happened before, has it happened to anyone else?  Except for the
&gt;muffler, I haven't had to replace any exhaust parts yet.

To fix this park over a gutter drain. Chain the skid rail down to the drain,
and then jack the van up into the air with some strong jacks. This will pull
the skid railing back down.

Sort of a hairy exercize as a lot of force is being expended.

Then, reinforce the skid railing back up to the frame rails on the vehicle
with angle iron so it doesn't happen again.
