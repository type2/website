&gt; &gt; and installed
&gt; &gt;       the  standard prestone anti-freeze, with the best Pgh. city water
&gt; &gt;       I could find. Have not touched it since. It has about 70,000
&gt; &gt;       miles since the job and has no signs of leaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Call me back at 140,000 miles.  From all the reports I've read &amp; experienced,
&gt; 70,000 miles seems to be near the minimum for the duration it takes for the
&gt; corrosion to get bad enought to leak.  While there are exceptions, I'd
&gt; venture that about 80% of head leaks occur between 70,000 and 130,000 miles.
&gt;  If you get 140,000 or more, I might take you up on that Pgh. water!!

   Well JIm at 140,000 mile on any Gas engine I would expect thing to
   be in bad shape!                        Eric
