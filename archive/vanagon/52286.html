&gt;You forgot to mention where you live as this will probably determine 
&gt;the quality of your &quot;bad shape&quot; bus.  One is bad shape from southern CA 
&gt;probably wouldn't come close to one rusted into the ground in upstate
NY.  I 
&gt;would recommend purchasing a running vehicle, one where the mechanics
are 
&gt;good but maybe with cosmetic damage.  I say this because you may not be 
&gt;prepared for the expense of fixing the vehicle mechanically.  You can
always fix 
&gt;cosmetic stuff as time goes on, minor body work, paint, etc.  

	I never took location into consideration.  I'm from Port St.
Lucie, Florida (where the N.Y. Mets have spring training)...And during
the weekend I go to Tampa Florida....Is that bad or good for the
condition of the bus?  :)

	Yeah, I think I should look into a running bus.  How much would a
Breadloaf in running condition that looks like crap cost me?  Anyone have
an idea?  I've been doing some shopping, but I'd like an idea.	

Thanks...

Richie
