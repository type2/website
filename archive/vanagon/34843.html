Gosh-durnit!
  I am sorely tempted to go and kill my ol' American bomb (daily driver) 
so I can justify getting something like that.  Ah well,  who would've 
guessed that a GM product from the late 70's could last this long...not me.
Some day I'll &quot;ethnically cleanse&quot; my 'fleet', but I just don't have the 
heart to do it intentionally.

&gt; * no smog!
&gt; * double cargo doors!

&gt; * rebuilt transmission and reduction boxes
&gt; * new brakes
&gt; * fairly new engine
&gt; * has minor rust in cargo area, not too bad.
&gt; * all glass, lights, interior, etc complete
&gt; * $1500
