&lt;&lt;  I expect I will need to replace my O2 sensor in the near future- how much
should
 I expect to pay for one (3-wire)? Is there a source for a sensor other than
the
 dealer?  What about for water pumps?  &gt;&gt;

I paid $30 for a single wire O2 sensor &amp; $100 for a new water pump for my 85
Westy from the following company (they'll ship):

Olympic Imported Parts
5168 Eisenhower Ave
Alexandria, Va  22304
800-572-2440

I've always been real pleased with the quality of the parts I've purchased
from them.  I'm not connected with them.  Just happy with quality &amp; prices.
