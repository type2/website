Subject: Re: side mirrors


Hi all,

Once the following happens to the mirror you can drill completely through
the mirror arm in the same axes as the original stud that is pressed into
the mirror arm.  Then buy a stainless steel bolt of appropriate size  that
you replace the stud with.  The stainless steel bolt can be countersunk
into the exterior of the mirror arm and the cavity filled with silicon or
something like that.  Now you can tighten the nut against the spring all
you want to.

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, this was a poor design by VW.  The piece of hex stock
&gt;&gt;which has been threaded to take the nut sticks into the &quot;socket&quot; of the
&gt;&gt;mechanism by only about 1/8th inch, and can be backed out by the action
&gt;&gt;of tightening the nut.  When this happens the mirror is basically junk.
&gt;&gt;I've tried repairing this with epoxy-type glues and a pin, with limited
&gt;&gt;success.
