 Well, yes, but how about the attacking dude, whose rudeness and
distasteful remarks were only scantily clad?  Bit my tongue real hard
resisting comment!  Got some kind of sadistic enjoyment out of the
exchange, though.  Not too proud of that reaction.  Just goes to show you,
you can't shut off even the basest drives.  Maybe that's what this
degrading thread was really about.

Philosophical mode -&gt; off.
