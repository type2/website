&gt;	Sorry if this has already been covered, but it there any way
&gt;to get a digest of the mail, like on vintagvw.  I can't sort through
&gt;all the traffic to get important messages (ie. getting a job upon
&gt;graduation) but I still enjoy reading the van mail.
&gt;	If so how ??

well, it's supposed to be able to be done by the subscriber, but it doesn't
seem to work right. so if you want to be set to 'digest', let me know and
i'll change you in the subscribers file.

but i don't know what the criteria is for the digest (i.e., when it splits
and gets sent) ... like, so many bytes? or time? or some many messages?

anyway, i'll go ahead and change you, brent. anybody else that wants to be
changed, let me know.
