Subject: Re: What is VW Karma?

Karma is....

by the traditions of many ancient (and not so ancient) people, the ticket 
to the afterlife...or, the next life...

sortof a goldenrule book..:)

a storehouse for good fortune.

i'm certian others will bring up other good descriptions..:)

the more karma you...er...make that positive karma...you build up, the 
higher your status in the next life. negative karma effects you just the 
opposite...

anyhow....david
