&gt;Second, it seems that our starter is approaching the end of its life.
&gt;Well, at least according to my girlfriend, who has the van out west.
&gt;I was planning on getting a new starter ahead of time.  Where is the best 
&gt;place to get one?  J C Whitney?  A rebuilt one?  Autoworks-type parts
stores?
&gt;A genuine Bosch?  Bus Boys?

Hi Jesse -

Before spendin' bucks (130.31 + 65.00 Core) in a Bosch rebuilt, check a few
things first.

1.  Are the Battery Cable connections (and cables) in good shape?
 Connections (all) at the starter? Clean?
2.  How about that Ground Strap between the Front Tranny Mount and the
Chassis?  Corroded to heck?
Replace it!  With a Battery type cable (insulated) with lug ends on it.
3.  Starter Bushing ovaled a bit?  That'll slow a starter down.
4.  Common problem with solenoids.  When the starter was new (or rebuilt) a
light touch of grease was put on the solenoid piston to allow free movement
of the Bendix.  Too light if you ask me.  By the time that starter reaches a
few years old the grease is gone and the piston &amp; bore are dryer than a
popcorn fart.  Pull it apart and use a little CV grease to free it up.
 Haven't had to replace mine in years.

Sure I wanna sell starters.  But only to people who REALLY need 'em (Bosch
units only please).  Save yer money to buy stuff like Underdash Package
Trays, Aluminum Side Steps, Poptop Seals, Poptop Canvas, etc. :))))
