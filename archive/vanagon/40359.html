Subject: any body got some nice spoon latches


i was wondering if anyone out there had a good used or NOS set of spoon window 
lathes (all 6 of them) that would be correct for a 59' bus

i am also looking for the &quot;older style&quot; (i.e. the seat doesn't slide on runners) 
drivers style seat for a 59 walk thru bus. all seat conditions considered but 
would like to find a nice one

any leads appreciated

michael
