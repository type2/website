&gt; You guys set the pizza thing for whenever is convenient, since my
&gt; schedule will throw a wrench into things, so to speak.  If I can join
&gt; you, I would love to, just let me know where and when you decide.  AFTER
&gt; x-mas is definitely better for me, as I don't have a free nite before,
&gt; but set it when you need to..

I agree - After xmas is much better!
