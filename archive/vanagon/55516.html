Subject: alloy wheel offset  re-correction

I read the post about the audi 5000 wheels and I think the person that wrote it
was not clear entirely clear about wheel offset.  There are two types of
offset(distance from the center line of the wheel) positive and negative.  The
wheels that were being talked about all have positive offset.  &quot;ET30&quot;  means
&quot;einpress tiefe 30mm&quot; which is german for the &quot;recessed depth of 30mm&quot; from the
center line of the wheel (positive offset).  So I'm afraid that the person that
was writen about was right in adding a 15mm spacer to a wheel with an ET of
45mm. This would have the effect of turning a wheel with an ET45 into a ET30
wheel, which is the stock offset on the 5-spoke carat wheels.          
                 Thanks for listening,
                 Derrek Wittmann
