&gt;   I suggest that none of you eat turkey today.  It's laced with
&gt;   hormones, and we all know most of you have a problem with too 
&gt;   much of that in your systems as it is!

Hate to object to this, but here's a minor point: all the hormones in the 
turkey are actually digested by the time they get into your blood -- they
are just broken down into the four amino acids, just as any other protein
molecule that you eat...

Now, if you take some of that nice and fatty juice that drips into the
basting pan and inject it....  Well, I do not know about that....
