Hi all,

	Well, last week I had the good fortune to meet list members
Gene and Michelle (mizamook) who reside in the vacation capital of the
world (at least that is what the sign said upon entering their fair
town) in Northernish California.  What a nice evening it was.
Michelle and Gene couldn't be a nicer couple, and they sure know how
to make a road weary (read brain fried from the driving and heat all
day) feel welcome and refreshed.  They are a couple of real good souls
I feel fortunate to have run into.  Makes me feel good to a member of
the human race when I meet nice people like that!

	So, I drove about 13 hours from Portland Oregon to say hello,
and buy about 90% of a 1700cc engine, that had already been dismantled
(by Michelle's father?).  The onle major parts that appear to be
missing is one of the carbs and the muffler.  But the other carb looks
great, as well as three camshafts, 2 sets of heat exchangers, a couple
fuel pumps, a couple fly wheels and three clutch pressure plates.  I
still have yet to go through all the boxes of stuff.

	I've never torn down an engine before, so all these parts are
pretty mind boggling!  But I've got the bentley and the idiots guide,
and I checked out the haynes manual as well as a chilton manual from
the library.  So I am reading up, trying to figure out how to inspect
all the parts to see which peices to use, which ones to toss (if any),
and hopefully by next summer I'll have rebuilt an engine!  It'd be
nice if it didn't take that long, but chances are...:)

	Well all, just thought I'd share that with you all, its nice
to see a face on the otherside of the list, lots of fun.  Hope
everyone is enjoying their summer!

take care,
	brandy
