Hey not trying to make a killing here in fact FREE 
if you need and want to pay shipping, to the first
response I get, I have an OEM bent Y pipe thingy that
goes to one heater box and to the crossover from the
other box and merge into the cat or pipe to muffler.
Bought new from VW in '85 and used about two years
still solid and these things were very expensive from
VW $70 or so then I think.  It is connected to the
origional crossover pipe from my '76 which is dented but
OK.  Both pieces are rusty but solid and should provide a 
couple of years use to anyone who has to keep their system
stock.  They were ripped off in about '87 and replaced with
a one piece system and have been sitting in the garage
since.  I got no idea what it would cost to ship but
certainly under $15 or so.  Anyway if anyone want them
email me at
