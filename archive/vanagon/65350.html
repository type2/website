Subject:      vw asbestos/heater boxes replacemnts

would all the people who have had their heater boxes replaced (for free)
contact me with this info:

- what YEAR bus was the work done on???
- what exactly was replaced on the bus??

all this is the free stuff that Le Coz and his mechanics were doing over
the last year or so.

i've got an idea as to the real purpose of this, but need some data to
see if i might be right.

thanks folks.
joel :)
