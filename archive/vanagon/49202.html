Subject: CCC RESERVATIONS!!! (finally!)
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

Hi kids!

Well, believe it or else - I have FINALLY finalized the reservations 
for our trip! We rented the WHOLE place. How's that for privacy?

The reservation was made under:

Kathy Myers - CCCs

Our comfirmation numbers are:

Site #1:    426823
Site #2     426825
Site#3      426827
Site#4      426828

It would be smart if you ALL take the above information with you.


Site #1
8 cars
$20 per night

Site #2
3 cars
$20 per night

Site #3
4 cars
$20 per night

Site#4
10 cars
$22 per night

Total of 25 cars - if more show up, they will have to park across the 
street in the CLOSED Ranger Station Parking lot and walk in an sleep in 
tents. 

Including the service charges for the reservation company, the grand 
total was $223.00. I put it on my credit card since they would not 
confirm the reservation with a check. This entire fee is 
NON-refundable... so I hope you all show up!!!  We can break down the 
expense  per person or per car - whatever.

:-)

Looks like we're going to have a BLAST!
