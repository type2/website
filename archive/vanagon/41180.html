Subject: Re:  cruising speed

Hey Ric (aka VDubDude) -

That was an informative reply to the question about reasonable cruising 
speed in an air cooled vanagon.  Could you share some thoughts with the 
list about reasonable speeds for the water cooled crowd?  

In my ignorance I've adopted the magic number of 62 mph as a 
zero-headwind cruise speed, with a downshift to 3rd (and drop to 50 mph) 
when I can't hold speed on a grade with less than 3/4 throttle.  This 
&quot;feels&quot; safe for the engine, if feelings count for anything, but I'd be 
curious as to your (and other's) opinion as to where the danger zones 
start (in terms of rpm and engine load) for the wasserboxer.

thanks,
Ed Mellinger
