Subject:       Starter bendix not engaging

First off, I've been on Digest mode for less than 24 hrs but I
ALREADY MISS YOU FOLKS!  Reading the back and forth diatribe just
ain't the same in a digest...  Lunch break now and I have a starter
problem:

In this new '87 van the starter occassionally grinds against the
ring gear and it won't engage until I hit the starter a few times.  I
had the starter rebuilt and a new bendix put on but it still does
this.  I can feel the edge of the teeth on the ring gear are worn
somewhat.  Do I need to replace the ring-gear?  Is there an alignment
trick when installing the starter?  Would experimenting with shims on
the mounting face of the starter help? All help appreciated.

On the coolant bleeding update-- I'm watching for air in the system 
after using the washer pump idea and all looks good so far.  It seems 
no matter how I do it, I always have to top off the reservoir after a 
day or two from working on the cooling system.

Lastly, if anyone responds to this and their mailer allows, please send 
response to the list AND me personally so I have SOMETHING to read 
today :)
