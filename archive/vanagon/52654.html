Are you using the standard diesel injector pump or the pump for a
turbodiesel along with the added turbo?  I think that adding the TD
injector pump and turbo would increase engine stress significantly, but
just adding the turbo should be real safe.

I'm working on a similar conversion.  Did your use of the Quantum
manifolds allow you to retain the standard diesel left motor mount without
modification?  Jetta TD manifolds and turbo, used on a Vanagon, seem to be
right in the way of the left motor mount.  Is there anyone else out there
running TD conversions?
