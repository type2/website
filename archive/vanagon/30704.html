Subject: re:A Manual Question

msanner_at_hooked_dot_net(Matt) wondered about Haynes manuals:

IMHO I think (comparing my Haynes and Bentley for transporter up to
1979) In some respects Bentley is better, but overall they are
comparable. With Haynes you have to remember all measurments are metric
(which makes it hard when you are using one on an american car) and some
tools are listed by what they are called in England (where the book
comes from), though they do provide a chart at the beginning of the book
for the US equivalent of those tools.

I feel you can get by with one or the other and Muir, although both and
the Idiot book are optimal.  Some will tell you there is no comparison
between the two, but the price difference (Haynes runs about $13US)
makes all things equal.

Cheers,

David

Hey all:

Went to a local VW place today and picked up some &quot;dealer only &quot;
stuff. While I was there, some guy was forking over $93 for the
Bentley Manual. However, on their manual rack they had the Hayes
(Haynes?) manual for all makes and models. For the Vanagon it looked
a lot thinner than the Bentley one (not that this matters).  I was on my
way out when I saw the manuals sitting there, so I didn't get the price.

Can anyone give me a run-down on these. Are they as good as Bentley?
Better? I'm sure it is mostly a matter of opinion, so all opinions
invited.


Thanks

Matt
