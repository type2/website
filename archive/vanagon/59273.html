Subject: Australian EV Camper

I have been off the list for a few months, great to be back.

When in Australia recently I saw a long wheel base Eurovan with a pop top
and stove, frig etc.  It had the name of Trekka or Trakka.  Any list
members out here who can give me a lead on the company.  It is in Sydney I
think.

Incidentally the range of VW in Oz is amazing - EV come in diesel or gas,
long or short wheel base, 4 door or 2 door pick ups etc!  Why not here!
