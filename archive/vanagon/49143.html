&lt;&lt; BTW 205R16
 is the VW Syncro-16 stock size, diam=??  &lt;28.5&quot; I'd say, R+P gear ratios
 avail were: gas- 38:7 and 34:7(ours) diesel- 38:7 and 35:6  The 16&quot; Syncro
 got diesel R+P, you may need to swap, but to which? &gt;&gt;
Tim, Does Vw change to the 38:7 w/ the 16's? I bet they do due to the rolling
radius.I had these 205x16 Michelins on my 1990 Range Rover I used to own and
those tires were pretty tall, smaller than a truck tire  ie:215 85 16, but
much larger thab a vanagon.They are also skinny.
