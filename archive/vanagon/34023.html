Hey all,
	I have a question.  I was out looking at a '78 bus today and I
	think I really like it but there was something weird going on
	with the hazard flashers and turn signals.  OK, none of the
	bulbs are burnt out, but when the key is in the on position, the
	turn signals don't work.  The indicator light on the dash comes
	on and stays on without blinking and none of the outside turn
	signal lights light up.  Same with the hazard flasher.  However,
	when the key is off, the hazard flashers work fine.  What could
	be causing this?  Is something wired wrong or is a relay
	defective or maybe a short circuit somewhere?  Please help as
	this bus only needs minimal work + paint and it would be pretty
	nice.

	Sean
