Good friday afternoon to all

This seems like a good day to introduce myself.  I have just bought a
Westie (87 Vanagon GL with 65,000 Km) two weeks ago.  Elkavitch, Michael
and Diana you may have seen it in your travels, it is a blue one and was
parked just outside Sussex NB on the Trans Canada highway with a for sale
sign on it.  I have already benifeted greatly from this list as I searched
to archives to find the answer to a flashing  and buzzing oil light, what a
heart wrenching sound for a new owner.  I have changed the oil and made
sure it is full with the proper VW filter.  It was running very rich; a
mechanic friend of mine found a bad vacume hose so it was replaced it is
running much better now!  This weekend is the test, my wife two children
and myself are headed down the road to see what we will forget to take with
us and what extra we will bring.  Our full plan is to go across Canada in
July of next year (4 to 5 weeks).

I hope that as I learn from the list and experiance first hand that I will
be able to help others as well.

I still have not been able to light the fridge in propane mode, so I shold
go and see if there are any web pages to cover that.

Have a great weekend and I will be back on Tuesday
