&gt; I Would like to someday get a Rialta. 

I wouldn't even consider a Realta.  Plain and simple, it's a pig, IMHO.
No ground clearance, no headroom inside, in fact for it's exterior size
it is really cramped inside.  I would much prefer the Eurovan Westy.

&gt; heat is as suffecient as the poor acceleration. Maybe someone should take a
&gt; Ford full size Van and equip it as a Vanagin Westfalia.  I think it would
&gt; sell like hot cakes.  I want mine with four wheel drive.  

I saw just this at an RV show.  It was awesome!!  Had a full length pop
top, 33&quot; tires, winch on the front, extended length van, looked like it
could climb Mt. Everest.  Had all the camping goodies too, like propane
appliances and furnace and even a microwave!  They were around $50K, I
think.  Slightly less for the two wheel drive model.

p.s. I nominate Dennis Haynes as the listmember with the highest S/N
	 ratio.  Vote early and often!
