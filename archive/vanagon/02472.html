The trip with the 87 was a different trip. 

We saw eskimos in Labrador with our 72 bus too. It was july when we reached
Labrador City and it was snowing. We couldn't find the hotel because there
were no signs in the the whole city. They didn't think they needed signs
because there were no visitors from &quot;outside&quot; until we got there, and
everybody living there knew where everything was. The police pulled us over
when they saw we had New York plates because they couldn't believe it. When
they heard we had driven in we had to talk to them about the route for a half
hour at two in the morning. Then they led us to the hotel.

The route the police asked about consisted, for about 100 miles, of driving
along some train tracks. The vibration was so intense all the bolts in the
van began unscrewing themselves. The bolts holding the accelerator bar
unscrewed themselves and fell off, so the car was on full throttle the last
half of the trip and the speed had to be controled with the brakes and
key-off only. 

This was my honeymoon.
