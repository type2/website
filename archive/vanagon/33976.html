&gt;&gt;THis second plate can be found riveted to the bulkhead behind the drivers
&gt;&gt;seat...unless some nurd removed it in which case your stuck!

it has been my experience that up to 1967 the metal tag was actually held
on by two small sheet metal screws (unfortunately making the tag easily
removable) whereas in 1968 --&gt; they actaully riveted the tag to the
bulkhead rendering it more stationary. (kind of getting hung up on details
here), i.e. to remove the tag you would need to drill out the rivets

btw the removable older style tags are always painted the same origianl
colour as the upper half of your van unless the dreaded PO really went gung
ho and resprayed the inside of the van the incorrect colour too
