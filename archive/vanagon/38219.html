Subject: RE: Wrecked EV for sale--$1500



&gt;&gt; 1993 V.W Eurovan
&gt;&gt; 25000 mi, bad side damage
&gt;&gt; $1500 (907) 488 7863
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thats all I know.  On the slight chance that someone is interested, =
&gt;I'll
&gt;&gt; look into it and shipping.
&gt;&gt;



Sorry All.  That phone # is (907) 488-7448.   I just talked to the fellow
who owns it and he said that the engine is there and untouched.  But the
passenger side is pushed all the way in to the center of the van.  He says
it is quite totaled.  I will look at it this afternoon and post more.
