Hi Derek!

I was off-line for several days and I lost contact with you. I'm still looking
forward to have the bench seat for my Westy. If you are still giving it away,
please let me know because I'm really interested in the seat. It can be sent
via UPS 2nd Day Delivery in a C.O.D. basis. Please reply. Thanks a lot.
Best regards,

Angel
