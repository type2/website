Subject: Re: Add-on Oil Coolers

&gt;Those barbed hoses with clamps are the worst.
&gt;After dumping two quarts of oil in the drive way on two different occasions I
&gt;went over to West Sac. to where they repair big trucks.  For under $30 I
&gt;eliminated all hose clamped lines, and replaced them with High pressure
&gt;hydralic line using AN-8 (used on A/C) fittings and swedged on ends.  A
&gt;couple of years later I eliminated the whole damn mess and went back to
&gt;stock.
&gt;I have found that an external cooler won't help overheating, just delay
&gt;reaching overheated, by virtue of there being more oil to heat.
&gt;I have also found that an oilcooler on a new strong well running engine is a
&gt;waist, takes motor longer to warm up, leaks. hoses in the way.
&gt;Most of the stuff in the mags are there because they sell, they don't give a
&gt;ship about your engine.

I couldn't agree more.  I especially like what the author of the &quot;high 
performance&quot; section of Muirs book says on the subject.  He says something 
like: &quot; build it right the first time, and you will not have to cover up 
your mistakes with coolers and .....&quot;.
