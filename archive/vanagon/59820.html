&gt;Does anyone know of a software package used to create fonts of your
own
&gt;design?
&gt;
&gt;This might help Ron out too if there is no answer to his original
question.

&quot;Fontographer&quot; by Macromedia allows you to create your own fonts.
Denfinitely on a Mac, but I don't know if it is available for wintel.

&quot;Freehand&quot; or &quot;Illustrator&quot; or any other vector based program would
work if you just wanted westphalia as a graphic.
