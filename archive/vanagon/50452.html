Subject: Re: Vanagon Dirvability

BTDT,  but following an article form LIMBO(?)  It noted that they tried a
10microfarad cap, but it wasn;t enough, and rec'd a 22uFd tantalum which I
put in.  Worked just fine, and the 'will not restart for 30 minutes'
absolutely does NOT apply (because it never stalls ;) )  Just after I bought
the van it was quitting often after 1/2hrs on highway, took 15mins for the
fix.  Procedure below is too OEM for my tastes though, so here's what ya do..

peel back the rubber boot, way back, and expose the white FI wires.  Find #s
2 and 4 and nick them on one side for 1/2&quot; using an Xacto knife etc. Don't
nick the copper! Force a small screwdriver between copper and remaining
insul. and pull up copper into a U.  Tin these with solder/iron and tin the
ends of the cap, with a nice blob left on.  Then hold the tinned cap against
the U and heat while holding. Hold til cool.  Then do the other leg of the
cap.  Pretinning makes life easier, keeps heat input lower and gives best
joint. Push everything back flat/neat and wrap carefully with tape then roll
the boot back over.  Voila, no one knows you were there and you haven't had
to fight ripping out the terminal pins and finding new ones.
Gotta go add that ground wire soon!!!

&gt;Air flow Sensor Modification
&gt;The addition of a capacitor to the air flow sensor wiring
&gt;may help with intermitent miss. (The mechanic at the
&gt;dealership says this will also cause stalling after being
&gt;driven awhile and will not restart for about 30 minutes.
&gt;Runs fine when restarted.) A 10=E6F/25 Volt capacitor can be
                               ^^^^^^  make that  E-6

&gt;installed.
&gt;
&gt;1)  Remove the connector from the air
&gt;	flow sensor.
&gt;2)  Pull back the boot on the connector
&gt;	for the air flow sensor.
&gt;3)  Remove connectors 2 and 4 from the
&gt;	hardshell connector for the air flow
&gt;	sensor.
&gt;4)  Cut the connectors of the ends of the
&gt;	wires, strip the ends of the wire and
&gt;	connect the &quot;+&quot; side of the capacitor to
&gt;	the #2 wire and the &quot;-&quot; side of the
&gt;	capacitor to the #4 wire. Crimp on new
&gt;	power timer connectors on the #2 and #4
&gt;	wires and reinsert them back into the
&gt;	hardshell connector.
&gt;5)  Reconnect the airflow sensor
&gt;	connector.
&gt;6)  Connect a ground from the metal part
&gt;	of the air box to the empty 6mm ground
&gt;	connection point on the right cylinder
&gt;	head.
