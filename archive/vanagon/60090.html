Subject: New Clutch in SW WA

In case anyone in this region is in need of a new clutch and doesn't want to
get dirty.....I just had my clutch replaced by the Clutch Doctors in
Vancouver WA.  Total cost for parts and labor was $317 plus tax.  I dropped
it off at noon and it was done by 6:00pm that day.  This shop came highly
recommended by a friend of mine at work.  This shop beat all the other shops
I called for quotes  by at least $140.  They were very friendly and provided
excellent service.  There may be differences in costs for the different
models/yrs of Vanagons.
