Subject: Re Pick Up Dates..

Ok guys - definitive from Bulli Kartei and Wolfsberg archives
March 7 1950 - first prototype Pick up built
Sept 13 1952 - producion line of Pick up starts

So if someone says they have a 1950 pick up and its true it's a prototype -
and NOONE i know in the world has got any of these...so BK tell me...
unless of course you know something we dont? Dave.
