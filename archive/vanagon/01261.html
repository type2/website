]The ol' water pump on my '84 Vanagon has been dripping just enough coolant
]to be noticeable on the garage floor for the past 4 weeks or so.  In the
]past few days it has started to make a squealing type noise that is audible
]at idle.  Sounds to me like its days are numbered.  I was hoping to find
]some kind soul on the mailing list that would be willing to FAX me the
]water pump replacement section from the Bentley manual.  I know this probably
]violates a copyright or two by I won't tell if you don't, plus I promise
]to purchase a Bentley Bible as soon as I come across an extra $65-$85 bucks.
]I have replaced water pumps on other vehicles before but this one looks like 
]a bugger to get to.  Basically I'm trying to figure out if I want to tackle 
]this myself or farm it out to my FLARS.
]
]Any kind souls out there?  If so email me directly and I will reply with
]the FAX number.  I would post it here but I fear that a hundred kind souls
]would flood the company FAX machine with Bentley contraband.
