I'm surprised that throughout the oil and oil change discussion, no one
has mentioned Castrol Syntec 5W-50 or other synthetic oils. That's what I
have been using for about a year now, thinking other air-cooled car owners
would too. &quot;My&quot; mechanic, i.e., the guy who does the yearly state
inspection, recommended it highly. It's significantly more expensive than
conventional oils, but it's probably worth it. The van starts real easy
--even on the coldest days in MO. It also seems to behave rather well
under extreme heat conditions: the oil pressure gauge showed 20-25 psi as
I drove in 108F heat through Arizona last month. Compare that with 15-20
psi last summer with temperatures in the upper 90s. 

If someone thinks that I'm nevertheless wasting my money, I'd like to hear
it. BTW, oil change every 3000 mi, because Muir says so. I also use WIX
oil filters (nothing but the best for my old friend). Also heard that VW
filters come with a special warranty: VW pays for damage to the engine if
it is caused by a faulty oil filter. --
