Subject: help-corroded handbrake rod and nut

I need to adjust the handbrake on my '87 Vanagon and the adjustment 
locking nut is badly corroded to the connecting rod.  

The problem is that it's connected to the cable from the brake
assembly with some sort of gizmo (looks plastic) right above the
fuel tank.  If I get a new part, anyone know how to do this
replacement without removing the tank?

I think I might be able to pull the assembly forward by pulling on 
the cable inside the car (don't think I can pull it all the way into 
the vehicle because of a rubber boot in the way).  I don't want to 
snip off the cable until a) I have the new part and b) I know how 
it's done.  Of course, once I snip off the rod, it may become 
obvious.

Has anyone done this replacement?  

Thanks,

-Karl
