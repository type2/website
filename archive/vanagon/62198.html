Subject: PS racks

Hi,

Your rack can be rebuilt, by MOOG, mine cost me $350Cdn sent in via a
friendly freelance VW mechie. One year warranty.  Mine is weeping
slightly around the valve body, shaft there was extremely pitted by rust
when I tore it down. Must send it back with a note, sigh. The seal kit
from VW DOES NOT contain any parts for the valve body, costs $180Cdn and
rebuilding is unlikely to work anyhow.

MOOG will supposedly rebuild the valve body if needed....

The MOOG rebuild required my own core, none in stock at the time, good
luck.  FYI both my end seals blew out together about 2 months after I
replaced the factory Pentosin fill with STPs Dexron-III ATF.  I now use
Castrols PS fluid, has a VW part number on the back and better resembles
the Pentosin $$ stuff.

Tim
