&gt;        Uhh, ever since I saw this post (and deleted it too fast) I've been
&gt;thinking there were some important omissions. This is, after all, an VW bus
&gt;list, so the ultimate (deceased) band should of course include the
&gt;following:
&gt;
&gt;Jerry Garcia
&gt;Brent Mydland
&gt;Keith Godcheaux
&gt;Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan

&gt;Voice Major, UT Austin      *  |  *      But I'm not the only one...
&gt;(512) 416-7980             *  /|\  *     I hope someday you'll join us,
&gt;&lt;ehintz_at_mail.utexas_dot_edu&gt;    */ | \*      And the world will live as one.

Righteous!!  You're way out of my league.
