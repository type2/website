Curt,
Just as Bill wrote, don't make statements until you check things out.
You and Bill are uniformed to the situation and should not criticism me
for expressing legitimate concern.   I thought this was an open forum. 
Think before you speak is a good suggestion of everyone.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;  Perhaps everyone should slow down before they jump on this
&gt;  &quot;slam the vendor&quot; bandwagon.  There are good and bad guys
&gt;  out there, and it now seems that perhaps Kenneth Winter owes
&gt;  Ron Salmon an apology  for his recent post.  I'm just saying that
&gt;  everyone should slow down and check things out before you type
&gt;  something you might regret later.
&gt; 
&gt;  Enough said,
&gt; 
&gt;  Bill Bowman &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Good advice Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently ordered exhaust components from Ron at
&gt; Bus Depot, and for one reason or another, there was a mistake on his part
&gt; about how to ship the stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; When I called him about it, he realised his mistake, apologised and went way
&gt; beyond what any retailer would likely do to correct a probem,  even to the
&gt; point of absorbing the cost of &quot;Overnight Guaranteed Delivery&quot;.
&gt;  Unfortunately,  those costs were far beyond any profit for the parts.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel bad that he lost money on my order and hope future business with Ron
&gt; will be profitable for him.
&gt; 
&gt; Misunderstandings and mistakes can and will happen especially in the
&gt; mail-order business,  but I can verify Bus Depot's sincerity and honesty, and
&gt; I find it hard to believe that Bus Boys would intentionally cheat their
&gt; customers.
&gt; 
&gt; I know it doesn't help the frustration we can experience on a botched order,
&gt;  but where would we be without mail-order places to buy VW stuff???
