&gt; I've never really cared if someone passes me on the right on a
&gt; three-lane freeway.  I assume that they are exiting or in their judgment 
&gt; the left lane was a bad choice.   As long as they don't tailgate before 
&gt; they pass I have no qualms whatsoever.  Tailgating, however, makes my 
&gt; blood boil.

Me too.  That's why I was so excited at finding (and purchasing) a 3500
lb. trailer hitch for my '73 bus.  It's got a thick square steel tube
running across the back underneath the bumper, which is much needed to
reinforce the paper thin metal of the stock bumper, and it's also got a
nice beefy section that extends out towards the rear several inches
where the ball attaches.  Perfect for punching holes in the radiators of
those tailgaters when I tap the brakes.  I recommend everyone get a trailer 
hitch on their bus, even if you're never going to tow anything.  :)
Found the hitch at the junkyard, btw...
