Subject: Re: Easter van playing.

&gt;Day 2 was to fit air conditioning. What A/C in the UK? Well alright
&gt;then, I actually cut the cab floor out, but it would probably be the 
&gt;same effect. 
&gt;
&gt;The previous owner had responded to a rusting cab floor by 
&gt;welding panels above and below the rust and then leaving it alone.
&gt;So over the years it rusted from the inside out, only showing up
&gt;badly few months ago, by which time its also taken out one of the chassis
&gt;(sp?) members from the top. So floor and a large lump of metal to
&gt;replace. Also after digging around with a screwdriver I found
&gt;the passengers seatbelt mounting has more or less rusted right
&gt;out. A moderate smack would have smeared an unfortunate passenger
&gt;all over the windscreen, but thats ok, cause the screen needs
&gt;replacing anyway :)
&gt;

More air conditioning!  My friends '67 that I maintain (the engine at least)
has no rear window and no rag where the rag is supposed to be, excellent for
loading tables through the back and chairs over the top.


&gt;Day 3 I took out the engine. Looking in the oil strainer revealed
&gt;a tiny lump of rubber and a small almost circular piece of swarf.
&gt;Nothing I particularly recognised as belonging anywhere specific.
&gt;Removing cylinder head, rocker gear and pushrods for 3 and 4
&gt;showed a pushrod from 3 with a completely missing end (on the lifter
&gt;end)!! Well that explains why I lost power before the oil light
&gt;came on and stayed on. I haven't stripped any more of the engine,
&gt;but I'm already playing `I wonder where the end has gone' detective.
&gt;
&gt;Oh well. I may just chuck a 1600 in for a bit and rebuild the
&gt;2000 as and when finances allow. At least with all the welding
&gt;that needs doing, the van should be a good 'un by the time
&gt;it hits the road again.
&gt;

Maybe the &quot;swarf&quot; (great term) is from the lifter insides getting beaten to
death from the sharp pushrod end.  End could be embedded in the lifter, eh
Sherlock?  Maybe you could see it with a flashlight.  wOW, definitely a
teardown job.  Could these perhaps be dual springs and/or high lift cam
assisting the entropy here?

Yes, indeed Easter/Passover mechanicking.
I say, weld header flanges in while yer there.

Sincerely,
Eugene, way across the ocean
