So why would you gut your cat?  Was it to string a tennis racket or 
fiddle or something?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, did you like the cat?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;  I heard they taste like chicken; use a little Tabbyisco sauce.A

I thought anything gutless was a chicken so of course it would taste &quot;like&quot; 
a chicken.

&gt; Did he stuff the cat when he was done?  Did he mount it?  And did
&gt; he mount it before or after it was gutteed :o

But if you stuff it would it taste like chicken or turkey?

I don't think we should be talking about mounting pussy-cats unless 
this is becoming a whole different adult oriented list now.

Sure it ain't Friday?
