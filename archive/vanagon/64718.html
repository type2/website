Subject:      Re: Door vents

Door vents on 87's and earlier had a blue plastic piece that slide back and
forth to open or close the vented air flow.  On 88's and up the venting was
moved to the back of the rear most side windows.  I've even pulled the tape
and put the blue sliding plastic on my 88 door vents, but didn't get any
additional air flow.  I suspect the rubber seal on the front of the door
panels on 88's and up stop any additional air flow from moving through the
door.  I guess this because there does not appear to be any ducts or
passageways connected to the chamber in which these door vents are located.
I'd also guess that VW didn't want to recast the door molds because it
would be too costly when they could just keep using the same doors plus
some additional tape.  The tape would cost extra, but would be offset by
the replacement of the blue plastic slidding piece.  All this just to quiet
the wind noise on the fronts of the doors!?
