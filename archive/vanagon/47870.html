   Mine did this to.... The grease is coming from the transmission
   out of the splines like you guessed. You are missing a
   rubber seal over the splines areas that  keeps grease  out of the CV
   joint.

&gt; This is a bizarre one!
&gt; Upon pulling my CV joints to remove my tranny for a rebuild :-(  90 weight 
&gt; oil came pouring out of the inner joint on both sides.  I know that all of 
&gt; the joints should have grease in them.   The only way oil could have gotten 
&gt; into them is if it leaked down the spline of the tranny shaft into the 
&gt; bearing, or if someone filled them with 90 weight a long time ago???
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone EVER SEEN this?  How can I prevent this from happening if it 
&gt; truly is a leak?
