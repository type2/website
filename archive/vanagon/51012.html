Subject: Re: pitted cv problem decided

&gt; Of course 2 of my vans are running day in day out on terribly
&gt; pitted but reversed joints.  Haven't failed them yet and all
&gt; looked much worse than any Bentley manual &quot;BAD&quot; picture over 10k
&gt; miles ago.  But I am prepared to deal with one if it goes at
&gt; nearly any time.
&gt; 
Ok, a someone dumb question here, since my CV experience is limited 
to rabbit/golf/jetta types: Is it true that bus CVs are identical 
inner &amp; outer, and left to right? Is it also true that they are the 
same from 68 right up to the Vanagons?
Just noticed the JCW catalog shows one listing, and one of my boots 
if torn, so just wondering...
