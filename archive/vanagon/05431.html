	Last night I did some more work on the sunroof.  I was looking at the
stuff Uncle Joel sent, and I saw what looked like a slit that the 
edge of the bow went into on the edge of the cover.  So I did that, making
small slits in the bottom piece, slipping the bows in and putting the
screws back in.  It looks a lot better!  You can't see the mechanism now,
and it sists closer to the roof!

	I also greased up the rails slightly with some waterproof grease.  That 
made the biggest difference!  I had a real hard time closing and opening
the roof before, and it would always bind up!  Now I can open or close
it almost as fast as I want!

	The magazine articles didn't mention the slit idea, nor did the VW
tech reference, but they were visble in the diagrams.  Hmmm.

	I also see that I could have made an easier time for myself by removing
the op plate from the latch bow first.  Oh well.

	Thanks again everyone, especially Joel!

Thom
