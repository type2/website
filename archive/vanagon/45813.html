Subject: [Question] Air-conditioning retro-fit?

How difficult is it to retro-fit a/c in a Westy??

My wife refuses to ride without it :^P

Is there a good aftermarket unit out there or is it better
to use a unit out of a junked Vanagon??  What do dealerships
charge nowadays??

Has anyone on the list done something similiar??

I would really appreciate any answers.  

William
