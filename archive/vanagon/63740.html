Subject: Re: Interesting Eurovan Pickup

&gt;  They sold EV trucks in Canada?  Are there many around?  I could use a
&gt;truck, and an EV one would be great or at least better than my old
&gt;Chevy.  Do you, or does anyone have pictures, specs., or better yet
&gt;brochures from VW on these?

Russ,  

I called the local Eurovan experts (a dealership that sells more EVs than
any other dealership in the area) who told me that although the Transporter
(cargo van) version of the EV is regularly sold, the single and double cab
pickups have not been sold since the EV replaced the Vanagon.  The ultimate
source of this information would be VW of Canada.  Anyone in Toronto want
to give them a call?
