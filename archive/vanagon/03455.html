Subject: Re: vanagon rear wheel brg. ????

&gt;I have the axels off I check the rear wheel bearings by trying to move the
&gt;rear wheel and find a bit of looseness in the bearing, is this normal ? 

Yes, somewhat, but if the tire moves much more than say 1/8 inch it's a bit 
much. I haven't checked the Bentley manual, usually these bearing are 
tapered thrust bearings and are tightened by the presence of shim washers of 
appropriate thickness. A loose bearing will roll on forever, almost, but an 
overtightened bearing will seize going around the block, it's better to err 
on the side of caution. With the CVs out of the way, and the brake shoes not 
dragging, you should be able to rotate the hub and feel for smoothness as it 
turns. Try to put some load on the bearings, in-out and radially, while 
rotating (the hub please) if you can feel roughness replace-em. If you can 
rock the hubs and get any movement and clunk-clunk noise replace-em also.
        BTW I never buy bearings from VW or a FLAPS, ever!! Pull the 
bearing, the number is etched onto it somewhere on the flank then hit a 
bearing supplier. They can usually get the exact replacement, or 
cross-reference to their suppliers. eg flywheel pilot bearing, $15.95_at_VW, 
$4.95 _at_ suppliers.
        All you vintage types... I've had incredible luck with FAG Canada in 
Toronto getting discontinued, no longer on any list,  nope buddy jes no way, 
transmission bearings for a '65 Porsche. The guy went through his old 
microfiche, then &quot;Let me connect to Miami,..... yup they've got 8, I can 
have one here in 3 days&quot; The price was $72 list, he gave me a 70% trade 
discount, shipped it airmail etc. etc. it fits too. They list in the 
'Porsche Club' stores like Automotion in CA at $US70-80.   bye for 
tonight...   tim s.
