&lt;&lt; My wife finally used the term &quot;Money Pit&quot; when referring to my 83.5 Westy
that 
 I've had for 3 months now.  After yesterdays $500 repair she's ready to
scrap 
 this thing.  I'm on thin ice right now.  (Please insert prayer for my van 
 here).  My current problem is one of the bolts I used to put the exhaust
back 
 on after I put new heads on was too long and striped the threads.  After a 
 while it has blown the gasket and is real noisy now.  If I go get this
fixed, 
 that will be the end of my van I'm sure of it.  What is the &quot;cheapest&quot; way
to 
 fix this temporarily at least.  I don't care if the repair only lasts 6 
 months, I have to do it myself.  Any suggestions (and prayers) would be 
 greatly appreciated.



The best fix is to use a Heli-Coil of the correct size.  You will have to
remove the exhaust again, but it can be done in the car with a right angle
drill.  The heli coil will make it better than new.
