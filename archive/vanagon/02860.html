Subject: CV Joint Removal (OK, we go back to the topic)

I removed 4 half-shafts these past two days, two from the bus and two at 
the junk yard (hoped to pick up some rebuildable joints [no luck]).  I am 
now convinced that an impact driver is the only way to go.  If you are 
considering doing your CV joints, get one of the 6mm allen sockets or 
12-point drives and one of those hand impact wrenches.  I tried an &quot;L&quot; 
allen wrench and the allen socket on a 3/8&quot; drive bar and succeeded only 
in stripping the head of one of the socket head bolts.  The impact driver 
took the rest out lickety split. (Family board, I won't discuss removing 
the stripped one)

Now that I find myself in need of replacement joints, has anyone 
bought/installed the $59.95 J.C. Whitney joints?  Are they 
Mexican/Brazilian? Did you get &gt;10K miles out of them?  (The three words I 
despise most are &quot;Hecho en Mexico) Also, when I pulled the joints from the 
junkyard axle, two needed to be pulled off with the heavy duty puller, but 
the other two just slid off by hand. Which is right?  Does it matter?
