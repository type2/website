Subject: Baton Rouge repair shops

Tonya.
Did you go to foreign car repair on Florida Boulevard in Baton Rouge.  I havn't
been there in ten years, but I noticed an ad in VW trends so they should still
be there.  In the old old days the were the only people in the area who knew
anything about VW's (except for the dealers).  I'm sure they are up to date with
waterboxers...Anyway, If they still have a mechanic named Francois, say john
jensen sent you.  (maybe these are the folks you don't want to go to anymore:-)
