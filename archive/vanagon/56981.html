Subject: Frank C. gives Tim S. a break (Ottawa mechanic)

Frank:

Sounds great. I'll be in touch.

Just a word of warning...Tim Smith is a neighbor and 
I have been a fimilar sight on his back step dressed 
in coveralls, armed with a greasy part, and spouting 
the phrase &quot;Sach..is your Dad at home?&quot;.

Tim . . . you gota a break, till April 10.

ps. Ottawa e-mail should be &lt;kubikd_at_em.agr_dot_ca&gt;


Cheers

Dino K
