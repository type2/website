 Hi,

&gt; Joel comments that some Vanagons were sold with smaller, carbureted engines.
&gt; Haynes manual on Vanagons shows 1600cc Type 1 engine in a Vanagon, which I
&gt; guess they did so there would be something else in the same racing class as
&gt; the diesels.

 :-). This is true- the early bricks came with either the 1600 type I or
2000 type IV engines. The type I engines were modified to fit them under the
low decklid at the back. Bear in mind that the European market for transporters
is very different from the US one- most of the transporters are sold at panel
vans for utility purposes with minimal equipment and low cost. For some people
it's almost an advantage to have an underpowered van 'cos it stops your
employees driving it at 90mph on the motorway!

&gt; Relatedly, when I was in Europe ...
&gt; ...  Turbo badges 				 ... saw several.  I assume
&gt; that these were turbodiesels.  Anyone know more? 

 Yup, probably the most popular engine in much of Europe. It's certainly the
one that my folks used to buy in their bricks (used for delivering books in
Scotland). I used to know the power rating but can't remember offhand- I think
it was about 70-80bhp.

&gt;						   In fact, do we have Euro-
&gt; pean addressees on the net?

 Yup, I'm in Edinburgh, Scotland (for another month) and Andy Erskine is from
England somewhere (Loughborough, I think). There's a couple of others about,
too, including someone who has just popped up on Joel's stats that's posting
from Germany.

Cheers,
        W.
