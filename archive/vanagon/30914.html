&gt; So GRAZUL_at_zodiac.rutgers_dot_edu says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How do you guys/gals do it?  A friend of mine really wants to sell me 
&gt; &gt; a '73 beetle,  it runs,  no rust,  a real beauty....plus two of its 
&gt; &gt; organ donors which can be left in the field where they currently reside.
&gt; &gt; The price?  $750.00 for all three...my wife is quite sceptical.  Is ity
&gt; &gt; jealously?  Could be the staggering price tag....Should I be sneaky?
&gt; &gt; I tried the Xmas thing already....I would love some input...


...It is better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission...
   ....(easier too!!!)
