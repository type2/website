Subject: Re:Synchro Shifter Trouble

I don't have a Synchro, but I've had plenty of manual transmission 
equiped cars.  Your problem sounds like either a badly worn clutch and 
pressure plate, or a leaky clutch cylinder.  I don't know the system your 
van uses, but I'd check the master and slave clutch cylinders (or 
whatever VW equivalent is on yours).  That's probably where the trouble 
is.  A way to check is to try pumping the clutch, and also be sure to 
check your clutch fluid level.
