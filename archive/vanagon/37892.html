Hello,

 Clock: My '84 has an electronic clock.  Mine died with a bad 
        capacitor.  Since I know about such things, I was able to 
        fix it for under $1.  Actually, the reason for this post is 
        to alert you to the fact that the clock can have either 
        electronic or mechanical problems.

Speedo: I'd check the cable first.  Perhaps it is kinked, or just 
        needs lube.

Mike
