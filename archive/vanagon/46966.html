&lt;&lt; My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is a
 noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the dash.
 I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of the heater
 controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in mid
 summer.
 
 Is this a common problem? What's the diagnosis and what's the fix?

I've noticed this same problem on my '84 Camper!
