&gt;Wow...this thread has finally migrated from VINTAGVW to here...so
&gt;let me throw in my $.02 worth...although I DID get chucked off
&gt;of VINTAGVW for expressing my views on VWT&amp;A and Douche Bags &amp;
&gt;Horny Volks Wusses....
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps when I was a pubescent 14 or 16 the format of a magazine
&gt;that featured both cars and semi-nekid wimmen was the ultimate...
&gt;Unfortunately, that was 25 years ago...I've had plenty of
&gt;cars...and plenty of women since then (not to sound sexist...
&gt;but you know what I mean)...
&gt;
&gt;Back twenty five years ago the thought of cars and blonde big breasted
&gt;bikini bug/bus bimbos would bring about the requisite necessity for
&gt;crank polishing....today, I'm older and I HATE the idea that the
&gt;magazine publishers believe that I'm still a 16 year old, and that
&gt;my purchasing habits, my life pleasures stil revolve around
&gt;this sort of drivel. Hell, if I want to have a car fantasy
&gt;today, I'll drive the bug or even the 944...if I want a sexual
&gt;fantasy, my wife can fullfill that...I don't need no steenking
&gt;magazine!
&gt;
&gt;The second thing I find offensive about VWT&amp;A or DB&amp;HVWs is that
&gt;the &quot;bimbo factor&quot; is clearly a devise to cloak the fact that
&gt;the writing in these magazines (both technical and event) sucks..
&gt;My 6th grade son can do better....and considering that I've
&gt;been thru college/grad school/law school reading something written
&gt;by an author whose highest literary style is to use words like
&gt;&quot;sano&quot;, &quot;bitchin'&quot;, &quot;resto&quot;, &quot;ass kickin' stereo&quot; just doesn't
&gt;cut it...to add insult to injury it appears that BOTH the magazine
&gt;editors and advertisers appear to believe that I'll probably
&gt;ignore the writing style because I now have a &quot;chub&quot; from looking
&gt;at the bikini clad bimbos....so therefore I will now have to
&gt;run up to the bathroom...latch the door and flog my dolphin..
&gt;
&gt;Their logic being with the amount of vibration going on, the only
&gt;thing I'll be able to focus on is the picture...rather than
&gt;the print.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'll pick up those mags only when I have to...if there is some info
&gt;that I'm not able to get anywhere else. All is not lost however,
&gt;this group as well as the VintagVW group provides much better
&gt;and IMMEDIATE tech info than any of those magazines could ever
&gt;do! In addition, clubs like the VVWCA, GASS, The CVA etc. puit
&gt;out a better newsletter than these editors at the various magazines...
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to get off on a rant....
&gt;
&gt;Ric
&gt;
Ric,  all I have to say is....... RIGHT ON!!!!!!!!
I do subscribe to one of those magazines and do agree wholeheartedly with
you and find it interesting in their reader's poll; that over 70% of the
readers are over 25 and married.  Maybe Muscle car Camaro mania magazine or
a similar lot would be apprapo for the cheesecake but not such prestigious
readers as those interested in such a world-class automobile such as the
German car.
               If I want to see cheesecake I'll buy the sports magazine
swimsuit issue or turn on the TV Hype type news shows,
