On my '80 Camper there is no wire behind the dashboard on the flexible
wiring board which will supply a tach. Originally it came without tach,
clock and, of cause, without water temp indicator.

I had to run a wire from the coil #1 (green wire) to the tach,
the regulated power from the dashboard regulator and the ground wire.
Be sure to have a tach for 4 cylinder engines.

Perhaps most 85 up vans were wired for the tach but my 85 crew cab
wasn't.
You can plug in the dash for an 85 GL but you will need to supply a wire
(green) to the coil.  Its on #8, I believe, on the multipoint connector.
