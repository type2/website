&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The 82 Westfalia has a way of &quot;monitoring&quot; the state of the battery - a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;switch with three dodes is located on the stove panel. Ours no longer works
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;-even though the battery is fully charged. Does anyone have any ideas on
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;how to fix or check the switch/diode set-up?
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I seem rember seeing an IC when last time I took the switch/LED board off
&gt;&gt;&gt; the stove. I believe it is a comparator IC which compares battery voltage
&gt;&gt;&gt; against three predefined voltages, low, half and full. It's most likely 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the power for the board is disconnected. There is a fuse somewhere in
&gt;&gt;&gt; charge of the power to this board. CHeck the fuse first.

David:

I looked up the Bentley last night. There is a fuse under the driver's seat
which the battery power goes through to the LED panel on the stove cabinet.
I also saw some pictures of the LED board. There are 2 ICs and a power
transistor (TO-3) on the board.

Check the fuse under the driver's seat first. If the fuse is OK then check
the connector of the LED board to see if power is live on the board and
the ground is grounded. If Power and ground are properly connected then
you may be out of luck for this one. Find someone with electronics skill
to check it out or repair it. I do think that it is very unlikely that
the board needs repair. Good luck
