&gt;In my own Westy, lowering the pressure is no problem ;-), but
&gt;pumping it up again (in the &quot;field&quot;, far from a service station) is!.
&gt;I've tried:
&gt;
&gt;Hand pump: Forget this. My arms are worn out before adding 10psi
&gt;into ONE tire.
&gt;
&gt;12V Walmart (or insert generic department store name here) pump:
&gt;Does pump the tire, but: 

Two alternatives that comes to mind: 1/ Buy an inverter and a 110V
&gt;pump: Price &gt;$100, way more than my student budget can devote to
&gt;this. 
&gt;
&gt;2/ Buy a foot pump: Real cheap ($5-10) but do they work? Do they last?
&gt;And how long would it take me to pump the tires from 20-45 PSI?
&gt;I hate to buy potential junk that break on me when I really need it.
&gt;
&gt;3/ Pressure tank (3 or so gal): Too bulky to motivate its place during 
&gt;extended trips, and how many tires does it fill on one &quot;charge&quot;? Less 
&gt;than four is my guess. 

This is going to be really stoopid, but hey it's Friday:  how 'bout using
the engine as a pump???  I'm imagining removing all plugs, ground the coil
wire, disconnect the fuel pump, then screw in a long hose with a compression
test fitting at one end &amp; a tire filling valve at the other.  It shouldn't
take but a couple of seconds of cranking to fill up a tire  ( &amp; it's at
least 130 psi - could do road bike tires too!!!)  ???.   Comments  (be kind
- it's been a long week).
