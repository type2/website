Subject: Re: A lurker revealed.


Having purchased an '88 Wolfsburg GL yesterday (still slightly giddy from the
experience),here in Houston, I am revealing myself as an ex-lurker and finally
have a reason for contributing (well I have afew questions).
I now own two VW's , one originally bourght in South Africa , shipped to 
England last year, then left in England (in company car-park, sob),when i was
posted to Houston.It's a lovely 3.0 litre Ford V6 conversion, but alas the 
tranny went crunch a week before I left for the U.S (no 3rd gear, what-so-ever).

The only thing that needs looking at on my new(ish) '88 is the brakes.Being a
complete bozzo when it comes to cars/buses , how difficult will it be for me
to adjust/replace pads on this vehicle.Is there anywhere on the NET that could
take me through it step by step.(or anyone in or near Houston willing to help).
I was hit with a $400.00 bill last year when I took my Ford to 'Brake Check',
and I certainly can't afford that now.

I look forward to any responses, 
I also have afew good tales of expeditions around Southern Africa which I 
will be telling later.

Hello to everyone.
