Subject: On The Road with Charles Kuralt

  Last night there was a rerun of OTR on cable television.
Charles Kuralt did a 5 minute segment on Volkswagens that
was originally produced around 1970 or so.  I'm guessing
the year 'cause all the VWs license plates were black and
Charles had the hair color to match.  California's plates
were gold on black in the 1960's.

  Don Burns was shown driving the world's smallest beetle
around his VW dealership's lot.  It was a tiny bug body on a
lawnmower powered go-kart chassis.
  Charles spoke of how kids these (those?) days were taking
the lovable beetle and making it uglier (by converting it
into a Baja).  Chopped off front ends, big tires, loud exhaust
and pinstriping by Shakey Jake of Costa Mesa.  Lots of shots
of dune buggies and off-road running followed.
  A beetle with a white, wrought iron body was shown driving
down the highway.  I saw one in the Chick Iverson VW showroom
as a kid but it was black and never knew it was roadworthy.
  Someone with a chopped, split window bus was doing wheelies
in a parking lot.  It looked like the wheelbase was less than
8 feet.
  Charles interviewed Big Daddy Roth while riding on the back
of his VW powered trike.  At the end of the show they showed
a black stretch limo beetle that had suicide doors. Kool!
