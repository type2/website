Subject: Re: Back-up lights -Reply

I've been watching twin threads, one on backup lights not comming on
and the other related to intermitant starter operation.  I had both problems
arising from a common source --- this applies to automatic transmissions. In
addition to the backup switch positioned on the shift lever, there is also an
interlock switch which prevents the starter from engaging unless the
transmission is in neutral or park.  Cleaning the contacts solved both
problems.
