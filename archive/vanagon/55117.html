Laurie:
It is possible that you &quot;stripped out&quot; the wiper arms where they attach
to the shafts. You can try tightening them with a 10mm socket. You will
have to pop off the black plastic caps to expose the end of the shafts. 
This symptom is also known as the&quot; I left the wipers on when I shut off
the car last night and now they are frozen to the glass and trying
turn.&quot; syndrome.

&gt;&gt;Replacing the motor the three times, as well as the switch and
