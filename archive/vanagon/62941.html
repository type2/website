     Scott-
     
     believe it or not - use original German parts!
     
     Bosch plugs
     Bosch cap and rotor
     Mahle oil filter
     OEM plug wires (yes, they're expensive!)
     
     Wrong Bosch plugs, aftermarket cap and rotor, Autolite plug wires 
     delayed my '91 from being able to pass emissions tests.  (I didn't do 
     it - blame PO)
