Subject: Importing vans to CA

Matt Q,  Yes, I just brought in a WA Syncro from AZ to CA!  I was in luck
because it turned out to have been purchased originally in CA!  It had the
CA pollution sticker etc.  If it does not have a sticker it costs $300 to
pollute. I found that the most difficult item to get was a statutory
declaration that the mileage on the odometer was either accurate, not
accurate or unknown.  This must come from the previous owner.  In any case
you have to get a smog check.
Don.
