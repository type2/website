Hey all,

OK, I've gotten six replies of interest for a camping get-together
sometime from March 7 to March 16.

Here's my schedule:
Friday March 7:  My spring break begins after 11:00 AM (class).
Sunday March 16:  My dorm re-opens at 2:00, classes start the 17.  So I
have to be on the road heading back to school that day.

Here's a summary of the replies I've gotten so far:

John Anderson (West Virginia) expressed interest and suggested either
southern Virginia to attract the North Carolina contingent or northern
Pennsylvania to attract the New York folks.

Erik O (Ohio) informed me that he and a buddy would be road-tripping to
Greenville, South Carolina on the 14th and that he wants to hook up if
possible.

Paul Wies (Maryland) expressed interest but nothing definite yet.

Tom Forhan (Maryland) expressed interest and suggested a New Jersey
campsite to attract the New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania folks.

Kevin Rusch expressed interest voted for the weekend of the 16th.

David Higginbotham (North Carolina) and a friend expressed interest and
suggested somewhere in North Carolina, like Hatteras.

Now, here's my ideas, feel free to comment or suggest better things:
If it's gonna be a weekend, as I'm sure it is for most of you, I'd
prefer it to be the weekend of the 7th, only because the next weekend I
only have Saturday to camp, as Sunday I have to head back to school.
The weekend of the 7th I have the whole weekend and David H. has said he
may be able to wrangle a couple weekdays as well.  

I personally am inclined to do something a bit farther south, like
southern Virginia or North Carolina.  With any luck, it will be a bit
warmer there than Pennsylvania or New Jersey.  Plus, I have a friend in
North Carolina who I haven't seen in a long time.  

As far as campsites go, I'm thinking along the lines of a state or
national park, with electric hookups at the sites.  Wouldn't want to
rough it too much :) .  But, if it does happen to get chilly we'll be
able to plug in our heaters (Then there's Tom, the lucky b*st*rd, with
his Propex ;) ) or TV or what not.  I'd like a place with hiking
available or other nice scenic/fun stuff nearby.  I have to ask the
locals to let me know what kind of parks there are near you and which
ones to avoid.  

If anyone's got any comments or recommendations, please let me know.
And if anyone else wants to join up, please let me know because as with
any gatherings, there will be cancellations.  I don't want to be camping
alone because everyone else cancelled :-) .

Take care,
Sean
