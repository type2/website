Subject: Re: walk thru~FWIW

On a similar vein does anyone know if walkthru 23 or 21 windows were
offered? If they were I see no reason that a walk thru Dorm. could not have
been made?

FWIW: I momentarily owned a walk through 15 window but of course it didn't
have the big ol' sunroof/skylights nor the belly pan.
Q: were the benches retained to help strengthen the buses with sunroofs and
all of the leetle windows and the huge~mongous dorm top cutouts? I guess
that Einstein (self) is the question that you are trying to determine. or is
it Einsteeeeen ;-)
