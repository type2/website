Bus boys,  I had one of those old sinks in my van also.  I found that it was
a slick idea, and good selling point, but useless.  I took the whole unit out
and now have a little less storage, but gained a nice big carpeted area.
A pan works as well or better than the sink, and a gallon jug holds
enough  drinking water to get you to the next source.

Question #2.  Get a louder stereo;  make a VW statement!

NO OFFENSE to any bus GALS out there.
Chris
