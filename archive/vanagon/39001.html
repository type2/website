Subject: [Syncro] front lockers

Ok Syncro pilots,

Fed up with getting stuck and only have three wheels spinning at once?
Here's your chance to dig deeper holes faster,
by adding the factory locking front diff to your Syncro.

        Hayman Motors near Toronto, Ontario has quite a few locker units 
available 'complete' for $1500Cdn each.  The units do not include the 
viscous coupling, but you've got one of those anyhow.  Couplings add another 
$1000Cdn to the price! He pulls them out and sells them seperately.  You 
will need the vacuum lines and dash panel knob/valve to complete the 
installation parts, and someone to swap visc. couplers and do the install.

        An expensive option to get one more wheel working, but hey if you 
get stuck you can have complete confidence that no one is more stuck than 
you are! Hello AAA, yes, towing please :)

        I want one of these babies, however....  Four tire chains are $120, 
and don't cost anything to install, other than jacking the van and kneeling 
in cold mud and water or snow/ice.  They will drag you out of most anything 
though, all four wheels each doing their bit.

Tim, off 3 wheeling this weekend  =:0)

And a note of caution to those spending much time offroad in deep water/mud. 
Hayman sez to change gearoil twice annually due to silt/mud buildup INSIDE 
the front diff. Do the rear annually.  This may save your viscous coupler.
