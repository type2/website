Subject: the split...


As a longtime VW owner (three diesel Rabbits, a '67 Kombi, and currently a
'74 Bus and a '90 Jetta), I hate to see us split, but I have to
agree...anything to reduce the volume of this list to a more manageable
level.  At some point, I'll probably retire Meuller (my Jetta) in favor of a
Vanagon diesel to supplement the bus. In the meantime, however, I'm most
interested in what my air-cooled partners in crime have to say.  Not that
all of you Vanagon owners won't get a friendly wave (and roadside assistance
when you need it), but the traffic on this list is so massive that I just
can't keep up with it.

My $0.02...

 - Tom
