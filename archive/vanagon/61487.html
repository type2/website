Subject: 87' Syncro Oil Pressure Problem
Date: Tue, 17 Jun 1997 11:21:39 -0400

I'm a little concerned after an oil change to Castrol 20w50 and a &quot;Fram&quot;
filter. I read the post a week or so ago about someone else having trouble
with Fram filters, but that was the first time I heard anything like that.
My oil light comes on after driving a while and won't shut off at all.
Anyone have any insight as to possible problems? I have no problem with
buying a new filter and will probably do so today. 

Still have some Syncro parts available, check out either link below.
