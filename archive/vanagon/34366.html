While on the subject of off-subject, but interesting engines... by far my
favorite car in Harrah's was another one-off car, the 1905 Compound.  It
had a three-cylinder inline engine in which the first and third cylinders
had a 3.5&quot;
bore, but the center cylinder had a 7.5&quot; bore.  The center cylinder ran off
the incompletely combusted exhaust from the other two cylinders.  Early
environmentalists!!
