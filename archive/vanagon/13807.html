&gt; So is a '64 Deluxe with sunroof and all the oval windows?  I have a '64 with
&gt; just four windows on each side (last two with cargo rails).  I just moved to

Well, they did sell the Deluxe without the sunroof and little windows,
my dad's '65 he customed ordered without either, with the 1500, and
with seatbelts, but was a Deluxe in in trim etc.

(in fact a guy has a really nice '65 Deluxe for sale out here sans
sunroof for $1600, genuinely no rust, a student brought it from
New Mexico or somewhere, has a 1600 DP at the moment and a 12V
upgrade but pretty much stock origional rust free and 140,000 (maybe
240,000 but with the great body it's hard to tell)  Interior shows
wear one would expect but only has one or two say 6&quot; rips in each seat
door panels dirty but complete, floor mats OK, second or third paint
job pretty oxidized, window rubber needed all round. If anyone's
interested email me, I looked at it and would have bought but just
got the '71 and don't have room for the split anywhere. Condition
is unreally good for up here in the rust belt, ie only surface and dent
work needed, no rust repair.)
