Subject: Rear hatch struts

Received the struts from Boge today.  Same as original VW.  One 
error on the numbers 291 927 is the correct number, no left and 
right.  These are for the hatch with wipers, the other no. isn't as 
strong for the others, I think 291 935.  Hope I got to the 
interested parties before they ordered.  Sherwin
