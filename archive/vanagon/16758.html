Subject: Why there are so many cars with &quot;rebuilt&quot; engines for sale?

Someone noted that all (most) VW's which are for sale have recently rebuilt 
engines in them.  I have been pondering this over the last few weeks.
A few thoughts:
1. the most obvious: They aren't all rebuilt.
2. They may be rebuilt, but very few parts replaced.
3. maybe rebuilt means the engine has had a valve job recently.

Seriously, how would you tell if the engine had been rebuilt?  If it was 
very clean, I might believe them, but in the space of two days, I cleaned my 
engine till you could eat off it.  So who knows.  When I was shopping for my 
current bus, I found a bus with a &quot;freshly rebuilt engine&quot; in it, the owner 
told me that it had less than 10k on it. I told him that it was a bald-faced 
lie, and left.  That engine was absolutly filthy, and hardly looked or 
sounded rebuilt.
Food for thought.
