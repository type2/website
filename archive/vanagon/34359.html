Subject: wiper/washer addition (for older busses)

Hey now,
        All the cold down here made it neccessary to fix up the washer
system so's to clean the ice off the windshield. Went down the the local
parts place, asked about wiper parts for the bug, they had a better idea.
Goes like this:

        Find a Rabbit/Golf/Sirocco/Audi/Whatever and take out the electric
(yes, I said electric) washer pump. Hook it up to your exisiting resevoir,
wire it to a toggle switch in an unobtrusive area up front, and Voila!, a
washer that works without a bicycle pump. Works real well, as I found out
this afternoon. Cheap too. Makes a real nice addition to the ol' warrior.

Peace,
