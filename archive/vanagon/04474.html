Subject: Re: Fricking headliner panel installation - 60 bus!!


&gt;a) What type of material are the original panels made of and
&gt;   should I have even bothered with the pressboard crud?
&gt;   The rear is campered out in original wood paneling and I
&gt;   was wondering if the same stuff is supposed to go up front
&gt;   as well.

Pressboard, is that the same as hardboard or Masonite? This is the brown 
stuff that looks like compressed dung. It breaks if you try to bend it too 
much and is difficult to cut cleanly. The hot tip for splitty interior 
panels here is to use thin (like 3 or 4 mm) MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard). 
This really tough, easy to cut neatly, and can be sprayed to match the 
original panels. It's even water resistant for when your door windows leak!
