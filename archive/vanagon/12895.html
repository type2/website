&gt; 
&gt; 17-20mpg on a '71 1600 in my '60 camper.
&gt; 
&gt; My 10 gallon tank blows, though, as I ran out
&gt; of gas AGAIN yesterday.  That makes 3 times this
&gt; year (no gauge, never was one).  Gas every 150
&gt; miles to be safe.  That's every other day in LA.

I get 20-16 mpg. in a '67 with a '68 bug engine...
and yes, the small tanks do suck. I am still looking into putting a
larger late model tank in.
