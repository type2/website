Subject:        Tires

I'm going to be replacing my Michlin XZX 185 R  14's soon and stopped by my
local Costco to see what they had. The only thing they stock is a Uniroyal
AWP Lariat 195 75 14, load range C,  LT tire. $261.70 out the door. They
can order a Michlin XC45 185 R 14 for $365.14 out the door. Anyone have any
expierience with either of these? I hate the thought of not being able to
use the XZX's anymore cause the work so well. Later,
