Subject: Re: Eurovan tow rating

&gt; I'm considering buying a minivan.  Does anyone know what the tow rating
&gt; of the Eurovan is?  What is the engine horsepower?  Is the automatic
&gt; more or less reliable than the stick?

If you really want a &quot;mini-van&quot; skip the EV.  It's in a higher class.  
Mini-vans are really tall station wagons as far as I'm concerned.

We have a 3500 lb. rated hitch on ours.  Have towed a Thing and had 
absolutely no trouble.  It didn't affect perceived power or gas mileage.

HP is somewhere over 100 isn't it?  But it is plenty powerful and much 
more so than the older Vanagons.  Power is smooth and evenly distributed 
all the way up.  Cruises up to over 80 MPH with no problems.  No 
opportunity to try faster yet.  Torque is possibly more important in a 
vehicle like this from what list folks have said.

I have auto.  Wish I had stick.
