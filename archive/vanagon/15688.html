Subject: Terminology

Some terminology questions.  I have a book on VW busses, but it's British and
the names are different.  I guess I should know this, but I don't.

Are all busses &quot;transporters&quot;

What are the preferred names for the first two stlyes of buses?

What does &quot;Type ...&quot; etc mean?

Is there an authoritative book out there on the history of busses?

What are the best large gatherings of VW's?

email or post on Vanagon...
