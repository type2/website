&lt;&lt;  We had a thread a while ago about several people not knowing about the oil
filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats revolve! Any
others out there?  &gt;&gt;

   My wife &amp; I met a couple with a Westy who didn't realize that the stainless
steel heat shield behind the 2-burner range is hinged and can be dropped so it
can be utilized as a countertop for draining washed dishes.

   BTW, here's an unintended &quot;feature&quot; we discovered.  The rear seat can be
clicked into  position facing backwards, forming a nice chaise which we find
comfortable for reading before bedtime.
