Howdy,

	I just put my shiny new center brake light lens, and hooked the wires
up, and life started getting interestting.

	The light went on, and stayed on!  I did some tests, and came to the
conclusion that the switch was bad, so today I bought a new switch and
put it in.  tested everything, looked good, so I bled the brakes (you 
have to after replacing the switch) and checked the light - it was on
again.

	Did some more checking.  I looks like the pressure in my brake system
is not going down all the way.  If I use the brakes, and then open a 
bleeder screw, I get a hefty squirt of fluid out of it!  That is what is
keeping my light on, since its pressure activated and not pedal-travel
activated.

	I'm suspecting the master cylinder, even though it is fairly new.  
The brake fluid had run dry a few times before I replaced all of the 
components, and maybe thats what's causing the sticking (?)

	Any ideas on this one?  Anyone ever have similar symptoms?
