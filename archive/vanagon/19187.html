To All:

Somebody buy it.  I'll overhaul the engine.  We'll sell it to one of the
wannavan-bees, make them send us regular posts on how well it climbs trees,
eats Porsches, gets 30 miles to a gallon, make all the Type IV types gnash
their gnums with envy.

(Semi-serious offer, at least with regard to overhauling the engine.)

-Bob
