&gt;      hi jim, sorry to bother you through email about the problem i just ran in
&gt;to but since my bus is in the garage until i can figure the problem out i
&gt;thought maybe you could lead me in the right direction for some information.  I
&gt; am replacing my canvas in my 1974 camper, and the top was already torn down an
&gt;d i can't seem to gasp how it folds in with a plastic strip that was also
&gt;hanging loose. If you have any ideas or know of anyone that could help me i
&gt;would be very thankful.  Thanks
&gt;Again! From Beth in narragansett, R.I.
