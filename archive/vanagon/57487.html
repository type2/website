	I felt the same way about replacing with a factory part. I used a 1/2 in
piece of pexiglass and cut it to fit. Cost me a buck and works great. I
still have to do the finishing touches because it was about zero degrees
when I started the job. If anyone wants a template, email me your address
and I'll send you one.
