Subject:      '93 Eurovan MV for sale/trade

Hey y'all,
I have a 93 Eurovan mv in excellent condition with approx.
55,000 miles on it for sale or for trade.
I would love to get a late model vanagon camper in trade.
We can do a straight-up trade (if they are truly equivalent)
or I would take a trade + cash.
If you would be interested in buying or trading, please
give me a call at (919) 933-6093 or email me directly.
I do not check my email consistently, so a phone call would
work best.
I live in North Carolina and would be willing to drive and meet
up with someone who is serious (so that you would not have to do
the full drive--we could meet halfway).
Call for specs....

KEITH
