Subject: Request Help On Antenna Installation

The antenna on my 86 vanagon broke off; the local VW people said that I needed
to replace the entire unit.  Well I have the antenna unit but I's stuck in
terms of the installation.  It seems that the antenna has to be installed from
the inside.  That is, push the antenna through the hole from the inside and
then install the gasket and locking nut from the outside.  However, I can't see
how to disassemble the dash plastic to install it from the inside.  If anyone
could provides some assistance, I would be most grateful.  Thanks!
