Subject: About Red Line gear oil???
Date: Thu, 14 Aug 1997 07:10:36 -0700

After probing the depths of the archives for about an hour, I give up...
Does anyone know approximatly when the Red Line gear oil discussion took
place? Or... if you have first hand knowledge and/or know about it's
properties, I'd be mighty greatfull. After rebuilding the Westy tranny and
adding a locking differential, I'm interested in giving it something good
to drink... Thanks,
Bob Bellanca
