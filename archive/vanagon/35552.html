&gt;	Hello all, my problem is that my fuel gauge is possesed, but only 
&gt;when it hits 1/4 of a tank.  I bought this bus in November and have not 
&gt;had any problems with it until now.  When my fuel gauge gets down to 1/4 
&gt;of a tank it starts changing positions dramatically dropping to the 
&gt;bottem of the reserve and then going back up to 1/4 and even sometimes to 
&gt;1/2.  It never did this before and registers fine when stopped, but when 
&gt;driving at constant speeds and not climbing and hill or bumps it just 
&gt;freaks out and doesn't stop until I do.  This started last week and I 
&gt;checked the connectiond for the wires in the back of the gauge, and they 
&gt;are all snug.  It tends to make your heart skip a beat when you start 
&gt;with 1/4 of a tank and then 10 minutes later you got nothing on the 
&gt;gauge, and you don't smell fuel.
&gt;	So is this fixable, bus personality, or should I call a priest?
&gt;
&gt;		Thanks,  -Brian   &quot;I am in no way a mechanic,
&gt;				  But I am a masochist, thats
&gt;				     why I own a bus.&quot; :)   

Sound like a bad sensor.  In order to get at it, you either have to remove
the tank,(you do not want to do this), or cut an access in the deck above the
tank.  I hate this approach as it damages the vehicle but the other approach
requires a lot of work;  Everything on top of the engine has to come out.
 Both these approaches should be done by someone with some experience.  Buses
burn to easy.
Dennis.
