Subject: Re: re Shifting, no clutch

I drove my 66 bus for four months using the clutch only at stop
signs.  I drove diesel school busses for a couple years back in
the 70s with crash boxes where a clutch was unnecessary.  Every
standard shift car can be driven without use of the clutch, except
for stopping of course.  The variables are &quot;fear&quot; and competence.    

Now that I've declared what i know, I wonder if someone will
reveal how narrow my knowledge is...
