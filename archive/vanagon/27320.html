Subject: RE: CV work and rebuilt parts


Got a pair of $175 rebuilt axles, have some shiny new parts under the
Campmobile.

This has always puzzled me, what is a rebuilt axle?  There is nothing to 
&quot;Rebuild&quot; except the bearings, which can't be rebuilt.  So is a rebuilt axle 
one out of a junker, with unknown mileage, new boots, and fresh grease?  Or 
is it rebuilt in the same way many starters on the East Coast are &quot;rebuilt&quot; 
..... unknown usage, never opened, but with a fresh coat of black paint? 
 Someone I know had a rebuilt starter fail, and the thing had sand inside, 
probably from the abrasive cleaner they used to give it that new coat of 
paint.
