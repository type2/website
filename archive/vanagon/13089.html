This is a tardy reply to Chris Bridges' post on bad idle with 009.

If I remember all the details correctly, this is a '71 bus or at least the 
carb is from a '71, right? The '71 stock distributor had a two hose vacuum 
diaphragm which, in conjunction with drillings in the carb, retarded the 
timing at idle substantially, to 5 degrees AFTER top dead center. The nominal
static setting &lt;engine off&gt; is 7.5 degrees BEFORE top dead center. While I 
would still look carefully for a vacuum leak, keep in mind that the idle with
the 009 will never be real good with the stock carb. The jetting is based on 
the assumption that the timing will be retarded at idle. If you still have the
stock distributor, I would put it back in. It has both mechanical and vacuum
advance and will improve your gas mileage over the mechanical advance only
009. 

I messed around with a similar set-up on my '72 bus. Without  the vacuum 
retard at idle connected, the idle was rough and it had a flat spot just
off idle. With everything in good condition and hooked up the way the
engineers at VW  had intended was when it ran it's best. Idle problems with
the stock set up usually turned out to be rubber hoses or elbows with cracks
in them, electrical problems, and in one case - a leaky brake booster.

Good luck, Chris!

Dave
