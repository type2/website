Subject:      Re: Syncro Alignment

There is a working link to the correct syncro alignment
specs on the Syncro Westfalia page, under
the &quot;All Syncros&quot; column:

http://www.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm

Regretfully, I have been unable to maintain this page,
and your continued patronage often results in my ISP
turning it off because of excessive bandwidth use.The
solution is a new proprietor and ISP, they  have been
located, and if you've been exploring the various
vanagon sites, you've probably found the nascent new
location. Details once its more in place.
