Subject: Portable Sunshower-III with Enclosure

&gt;
&gt;Has any one ever used this thing before?  It is a big bag of water that heats
&gt;up from  solar energy that is hung from a high object.  There is also a
&gt;privacy enclosure that can be hung around below the bag of water.  Each of
&gt;these were 19.99
&gt;for a total of 40.00 plus shipping. They were in the R.V. Direct catalog.
&gt;Any help would be great. Thanks

I haven't used that particular model, but I do have an older one - just a
big bag of thick vinyl thats clear on one side. Works great when the sun
shines.
Fill it with water you've heated when it doesn't. Either way, enough for a
couple of navy showers at least.
