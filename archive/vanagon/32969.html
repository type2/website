Ya know how busses leak a little oil to mark their spot?

My new bus is different.  Yes, it leaks, but not oil - it leaks rust!

Every time I slam the door, little clumps of rust fall to the ground.  When
you slam the door, you can hear the pitter-patter of little rust particles
cascading to the ground!
