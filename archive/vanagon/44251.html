Subject: Touch Up Paint for Vgon

Steve Maher asked about touch up paint ---   Years ago I had one of those day
glow green and yellow loafs with the bright blue horizontal stripe seperating
the two colors.

Needing touch up paint for it in quantity greater than 1/2 oz but not enought
to repaint the entire van, I went to an automotive paint store.  They got the
paint codes and mixed a quart for me, and loaded part of that quart into a
custom spray can.  By the way, after they mixed the paint, the smeared a bit
on some paper and took it outside to the van and compared the match.  Since it
was off a bit, they went back and &quot;custom&quot; matched it to account for some
fade.  Worked out great!
