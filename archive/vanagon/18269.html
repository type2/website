                   Cows and Other Useful Stuff

A recent series of posts on the 17mm hex tool used on the VW
tranny caused me quite a bit of confusion.  I use a 5/8&quot; coupling
nut, an internally threaded sleeve used to connect threaded rod
together.  I've been using it (or one like it) for nearly 40
years; started using it about ten minutes after crawling under my
first VW.  (Back then [1956], metric tools were as rare as lips
on a chicken.)

No, it's not a perfect fit; 5/8&quot; is only 16mm, about forty-thou
shy of the real thing; it wouldn't do in a 12-point socket.  But
when you're dealing with a hex-socket it works well enough.  And
you don't need a lot of force with VW drain plugs either coming
or going; they're tapered.  If you put them in with too much
muscle you can crack the case.  (I recall drilling a 5/16&quot; hole
through the first one I used so I could get a tommy bar in there;
that way, you didn't need a wrench.)

I thought everyone used coupling nuts.  They used to cost about a
quarter; probably more nowadays.  Get them at the hardware store,
back with the nuts &amp; bolts.  

Machinists use a lot of five-eights stuff.  If you're really
strapped they'd probably give you a 5/8&quot; hex-head hold-down bolt. 
The head will work for you.  Grab the shank with vise grips.  Or
your teeth, if you're really strapped.

I see J. C. Whitney sells a 17mm hex-thingee for a 1/2&quot; drive
socket set.  Three bucks.  (14 xx 4740A).  They've also got those
intake manifold boots that don't leak; even got them in black if
you're the shy type.  Four bucks.  (38 xk 2005T).   And those 12-
point bits for CV joints.  Damn, but those things were hard to
find!  Had to drive all the way to Tijuana to get a set.  (It's
not the drive, only fifty miles or so, it's the border; takes you
about two hours to get back across the line.)  Now they got them
in J. C. Whitney; save you that wait at the border.  Expensive,
though; ten bucks for a set of four.  (14 xt 1662P).

I wouldn't buy a cow from J. C. Whitney.  (Probably come with a
little notice:  &quot;Teats available at extra cost&quot;)  But I feel
pretty safe using them for things like gaskets and consumable
tools, stuff you want to keep on hand because you know you're
going to need them.  But no cows.
