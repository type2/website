&gt;Howza,
&gt;	Matt Sanner sent me a gif file of a sticker idea he had.  I think
&gt;it's rather cool, myself.  The gif is in B/W but he says the actual
&gt;drawing is in color.  Check it out!

Nice! I like the idea of adding graphics. How about cartoonesque splits,
loaves, vanagons, and Euros driving down a futuristic (tron) highway? Lots
of colors...
