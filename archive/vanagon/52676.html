Subject: Re: Safety: Harnesses better than seatbelts?

So then, James C. asked:

&gt;On the subject of better safety, does anyone know if 4 point harnesses
are
&gt;a lot better than standard 3 point belts? All race car drivers use
them,


I've used the three point Schroth harness on another car I used to
have and it did a creditable job of keeping the body in place.  I 
have to say it reduces submarining and lateral motion by quite a bit.
'Gotta watch out for that flopping head though, like someone else
mentioned earlier...

I've still got the harness, but I don't use it, 'cuz, uh, it'd look
a little, uhm, out of place in an EV, if you know what I mean.
You're welcome to try it out though...
