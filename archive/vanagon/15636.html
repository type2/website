So Gerald Skerbitz says:
&gt; I propose the next time someone wants to bring up the topic of &quot;My car is 
&gt; better than *your* car&quot; that they put [s] /s or something like that in 
&gt; the message indicating the stupidity of it.
&gt; Please refrain (both sides here).  All cars are money pits, and we are 
&gt; banded here to keep VW buses running and not to believe that they are the 
&gt; be-all and end-all of cars, but because we want to keep ours running.  
&gt; Some of the people on this list might even HATE their VWs.  It doesn't 
&gt; matter. Please don't get juvenile about this.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; P.S. It's in the archives -- why are we rehashing it?

Well Dad-e-o,

I don't particularly agree with you on this.  Sometimes, IMHO, these kind 
of things need to get re-hashed (cornbeef? ;) ) out so that the list can 
grow (or shrink) as a result of the discussion.  I really don't think it 
was a juvenile discussion at all.  Someone had a real legitimate argument 
about the handling characteristics and other virtues (or lack there of) of 
the VW van and wanted to test the feelings of the list about it.  Some, 
back and forth, debate ensued, and people who didn't even participate can 
and will make their own decision about the two sides viewpoint.  Yes, maybe 
these issues are in the archives, but were they hashed enough for those 
concerned about the issues we were debating about?  I suspect not.  And 
this list, after all, is about discussion isn't it?  I hope, just because
the debate gets a little heated, doesn't mean that it can't be considered
for discussion.  Sometimes it has to in order to get to the real answers.
I don't think anyone got too singed in this debate.  And if you don't
care for this particulare thread, you should use the 'D' key accordingly.
Again IMHO.

Off my soapbox,

Thanks for listening (Dad) ;)
