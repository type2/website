Subject: Re: Bruno #1Big Phillips Screws

&gt;&gt;Anyone have any ideas for freeing extra large phillips head screws?

Yes, go buy an impact driver, it will come with a large enough Phillips head
bit. Oh, I'd recommend buying a thick pair of gloves, something akin to a
goaltenders mit.  This is to allow you to smack yourself firmly on the
tender bits of your hand several times while trying to nail the impact
driver with the hammer :&gt;.  Tim Smith
