Subject: 87 Oil Pressure Fixed: Down with Fram!!!
Date: Fri, 20 Jun 1997 15:54:36 -0400

I'm finally back to the real world :-) Super long work days this week :-(

Thanks to Karl B, Uncle J, Dan F, Richard A, Joe W, and VWbus for the oil
pressure info they sent me. (If I missed anyone, sorry) I replaced the Fram
filter with a Mahle (all I could get at the time) and all is fine :-) Now I
can devote some time to stripping the rest of the parts van and get it out
of here. I've updated my sites below (pick one, they're the same) and hope
to spend some time this weekend on the Westy.
