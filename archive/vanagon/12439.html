Subject: Re: Busted ignition lock

&gt; I've got a key tumbler with a little (cheap pot metal) shaft that
&gt; broke off.  It won't engage the plastic electrical connector switch.

I found a better price for the ignition lock tumbler - $19.95 at
a nearby aftermarket parts supplier.  It's Brazilian manufactured.
I also replaced the electrical connector _at_ $19.95 because I took
the original one apart &quot;to see how it works inside&quot;. I destroyed it.

The dealer wanted $46 for just the tumbler - special order. Boo.

After all the knuckle-busting and cussing I finally got it all back
together.  The ignition works great. But the horn stopped working.
I think I pinched the green horn wire inside the column or something
stupid.  All I wanted is to get her back on the road 'cause it's
raining again.

Thanks to all for co-miserating and good advice,
