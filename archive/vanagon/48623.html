 You can buy one that mounts in a class III reciever hitch.  Which you can
buy
 from a guy named Dennis Haynes for $225 including shipping.  I bought a
hitch
 from him and it went in &quot;slick as a whistle&quot;  _No_ problems at all mounting
 it up.  Excellent quality, service, etc.  Do I sound like a satisfied
 customer yet?  I am.  
 
 If I remember right his address is Dhaynes_at_AOL_dot_com.  Tell him I sent you.
 
 Oh, when you are not using it to haul bikes it also doubles as a trailer
 hitch so you can pull a trailer!!

Actually, my e-mail address is DHaynes57_at_AOL_dot_com.  Camping world offers a
full assortment of bike and cargo carriers that fit well with that hitch.  I
presently use thier &quot;Wheelless&quot; trailer with an adapter that allows that
carrier and a trailer.  I will be adding a 3 postion bike rack to that
set-up.

Dennis.
