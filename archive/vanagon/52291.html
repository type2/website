&lt;&lt; How well does a Syncro Westy fare on sand dunes?  We have a pretty good
 set of dunes on the west side of Michigan (Silver Lake, Sleeping Bear,
 etc.), and have been considering taking a Syncro out on the sand.  &gt;&gt;

I've been on a lot of 4x4 trails including a lot of sandy river beds, but
haven't once ventured onto (into??) any dunes.  The dunes I'm familiar with
are very soft shifting sand and I suspect a Vanagon Syncro would fare poorly.
 The Syncro has quite a bit of weight and a relatively small tire contact
patch - a combination that I believe couldn't handle dunes.

On the other hand, I'd love to see someone else try it and report back to the
list what happens.  I'd suggest bringing along a &quot;real&quot; dune vehicle and a
winch!

Good luck,
