&gt;I don't believe that, in 1986, this is called a Westfalia Weekender.
&gt;
&gt;I was just looking at one the other day and it was called simply a Wolfsberg
&gt;Westfalia 
&gt;Camper.
&gt;
&gt;This was supported by Wolfsberg crests on the sides.
&gt;
&gt;Features are same as listed below.
&gt;
&gt;Just wanted to add:
&gt;
&gt;-Poor quality velour fabric interior, doesn't wear for sh#t.

Oh No.... Ok,  Here we go again..........(you asked for it...:&lt;)

The &quot;Westfalia Weekender&quot; is a non-factory term used to coin the:

Wolfsburg Ed. non-GL Westy's  ( &quot;WWW&quot; )
               AND
Standard non-GL Westy's.


Keep in mind that in '84 there was a two tone brown Wolfsburg Ed. Westy that
was a 
FULLY equipped GL westy, and The weekender term, followed by the Name &quot;Westy&quot;
is used to differentiate from this model.

Cleared up now?
(of course not....  :&lt;)
