I had a similar situation with two different keys and a locksmith was able
to rekey the barrels so they all worked with one key. However, be
prepared for some corroded barrels if you live in a damp climate. All my
barrels looked pretty bad, and I had to replace one because of corrosion.
The whole thing (mostly labor) cost around $100 US.

I have acquired a 1984 GL with two different keys which is slightly
cumbersome.

Is it simple or inexpensive change some or all of the barrels so that one
key will fit ignition/cab doors/sliding door/rear hatch?
