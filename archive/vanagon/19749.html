OK, so it's not a bus but at least its a VW (of sorts). I found a die-cast  
model of a Renegade buggy at a swap-meet. It looked a bit tatty so I painted 
it the same colour as Ann's buggy. Bearing in mind I've only ever seen three 
real-life Renegades, including ours, I couldn't believe it when I found a 
model of one. I'd like a plastic kit of a bay window bus, but they just 
don't seem to exist, which is strange when you consider how many real ones 
were made and are still about.
