Subject: Re: Snap-On Catalog


Many of their tools (particularly the low-end products) are not
actually made by Snap-on at all, but by a subsidiary called
'Blue M' or something like that.  I think they have the same
garantee, though.  I didn't find this out until I actually
got the tools in hand, since they are advertised as 'Snap-on'.
(These were tools bought by my employer at my last job).
