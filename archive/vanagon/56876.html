&gt;I have an '84 Vanagon in need of engine work.  It has a serious coolant

&gt;
&gt;Any recomendations on parts suppliers?  I have seen AVP's web site, any 
&gt;comments on them?

Try Fast German Auto at 888-211-3334 or at their web page at
fastgermanauto_dot_com.  I was very happy with their knowledge and the rebuild
job they did on my 84 Westy.

Take care...Bob
