Subject: ROUND GIZMO TO LEFT OF HEATER CONTROL

OK, I'LL BITE AGAIN SINCE NO ONE ANSWERED WHAT THE SMALL ROUND GIZMO ON THE
VANAGON DASH IS. THE MANUAL PICTURES IT BUT DOESN'T ID IT. WHAT IS IT?

AS AN ASIDE, IS IT PART OF THE VW  MYSTIQUE THAT APPARENTLY PEOPLE CAN OWN
THESE THINGS FOR LIFETIMES AND STILL NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT HOW THE HEATER
CONTROLS WORK?
