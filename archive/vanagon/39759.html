&gt;
&gt;How much power the viscous coupling &quot;dumps,&quot; or absorbs, is a matter of
&gt;design. I confess I do not know how much the Syncro dumps. In most trucks I
&gt;think it's around 30%, but if anybody knows better please clarify.

I generally concur with Ken's comments.  VW claims that 90% of the torque can
be applied through the viscous coupling to the front wheels.
