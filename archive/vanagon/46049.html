Subject: Further adventures of Ras Bulli Split [Part the fourth].

[At the end of this installment of &quot;The further adventures of Ras
Bulli Split&quot; is a plea to the list community for parts needed to get
things going...some of these parts are easy to find and I know that
I can order them from BusBoys, WCM or WW...however others I have not
been able to locate in any parts catalogues... I am hoping that
someone will have parts for sale/trade]

Hello out there all you brick pushers, breadloaf babies, and
Vanagonauts:

It has bee sometime since we last checked in on our fearless duo [..no
this is not a story about a moose and a squirrel], and since
then...well...not much has gone on.  Ras Bulli has spent the better
part of six weeks kicking back with his tyres up while his suspension
as been disassembled in such as manner as to break as few components
as possible ;-)  This was also the opportunity to renew the entire
braking system [which turned out to be more of an exercise in
&quot;replacing&quot; rather than &quot;renewing&quot;...needless to say, I can now write
cheques with the speed and precision of an Olympic medallist].  

The highlight of recent events included a tiring three round
wrestling match with the rear axle nuts [of which you have probably
heard enough by now...so I will spare you from reading the tail yet
again].  I was also able to locate a three-finger puller of sufficient
proportion as to tackle the rear brake drums [it will be arriving in
the next couple of days]...originally used to pull drum-heads from
marine cargo wenches, it should scare those drums off in no time :-).

This weekend has been spent doing those &quot;little things&quot; that tend to
accumulate in number until a complete day can be spent putting
around.  This morning I disassembled the windshield wiper assembly and
discovered that the wiper &quot;shaft and crank&quot; for the passenger side had
seized in its guide tube and sheared off.  I also had the dubious
pleasure of draining yesterdays downpour from the passenger side
headlight assembly [which is now a slimy, rusty treat inside].  

Today's little treat was the &quot;horn which hasn't worked since I have
had the Bus.  I was planning to pull the horn off the Thing for the
purpose of passing this year's inspection and in the process of
removing the old bus horn decided to blow it out with the compressor
just &quot;to see&quot;.  I then hooked it to the pos. terminal of the batter
and intermittently grounded the other terminal...after a few
&quot;clickity-clicks&quot;, my head was almost taken off by a sound that could
nearest be described as a 'moose in rutting season'.  Hey, inspection
doesn't require that the horn be &quot;polite&quot;, just that it make
sufficient noise...and that it does!  So, for the first time, Ras
Split has a fully functioning horn :-)

Inspection is the end of the month and provided that &quot;they&quot; do not
insist on seat-belts, we will be ready...more or less.

However, there are a few things that are needed before I can do any
amount of 'transporting':

1)  New seals for headlight and front turnsignal assemblies...I also
need those little rubber &quot;nibs&quot; that go inside the headlight
assemblies to cushion the sealed beam and adjusters.  I was hoping to
put this off until after the body work and painting was done...but I
am growing tired of draining the headlights after every rain...plus I
do not need anymore rust...I already have my share.

2)  New turnsignal/high beam assembly ... I have cleaned and re-soldered
the connections in my current turnsignal lever.  The turn signals work
fine, however toggling between high/low beam requires &quot;jiggling&quot; the
switch until the desired setting is achieved.

3)  New &quot;crank and shaft&quot; and possibly &quot;guide tube&quot; for the
passenger-side windshield wiper.  I haven't been able to extract the
broken shaft from the tube ... it is currently &quot;soaking&quot; in
penetrating oil.

4)  New engine seal gasket [whatever it is called].  This is the big
gasket that goes between the engine tin and the floor of the engine
compartment to keep all that nasty hot air out.

5)  Air-cleaner and duct that attaches to the carb. --trust I, these
things do not bounce very well, no enjoy falling off the back of a
truck :-(...


Non-essential items [I am still looking for the following]:

6)  Sun visors and mounting brackets...PO had removed the originals to
put in another Bus.

7)  Front overriders ... the complete assembly.  I have managed to
locate a set of rear overriders.

8)  windshield washer bottle and pump  .... anyone want to part with
one of these?

9)  I need the rubber seals that go where the clutch/brake/accelerator
pedals come through the floor of the van...the local VW dealer
couldn't find them...does anyone still make these?

10)  I am also looking for a dual chamber master cylinder.  Where Ras
Bulli Split is mostly a '66 Westy [the rear end...engine compartment,
etc is from a '67 deluxe and the electrical is 12v], I only have a
single chamber master cylinder that I am just waiting for it to start
leaking [it's never been rebuilt]


All sought after parts are for a '66 Kombi/Westy that is part '67
...as mentioned above...12v electrical, and some '67 body parts...ie I
have two chassis numbers...the PO had registered the bus as a '67
based upon the number in the engine space.

Any and all help will be greatly appreciated...Hey the sooner i get
this thing going...the greater are the chances of my &quot;mug&quot; ending up
on your doorstoop ;-)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
