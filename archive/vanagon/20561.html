Subject: odometer &amp; hub cap enquiry


I have an 82 Vanagon and when I bought it the odometer didnt work but the 
speedometer does. Does anyone have any suggestions before I rip the dash 
apart??

Also I am looking for 1 hub cap for her, does anyone have an extra or 
know where I can get one?

Also I would like to get a set of the silver caps that are on the older 
vans, now will these fit on my 82? Where can I get them if they do?

Thanks

Jared
