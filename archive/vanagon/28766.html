I have this Dutch EV Brochure on safety, it covers the safety-aspect-evolution
back to '68. There are some action pictures on baywindow crashtests, there is
one that shows a baywindow, airborne, bouncing back of a frontal collision
with something, dono what the speed was, but imagine a Bus coming off the ground...
The cabine of the car was entirely intact, the frontbumper support (post '72)
seemed to have done what it's supposed to, the entire front became flat.
Seeing this picture gives me a safer feel driving a Bus.

Brian.
