Subject:      HOW TO CLEAN YOUR LUGGAGE RACK a step by step procedure

1.  Wait for sunny day
2.  Tell wife you will be busy for a while.  Could you look after the kids?
3.  If that doesn't work tell her you think that the effin roof may be
rusted through and you have to get to it now.
4.  Buy case of beer; at least one foot high.
5.  Remove four visible screws from pop top with Large screwdriver.  These
are the large round ones with the noticible streaks of rust below them.
6.  Go inside camper, stand on case of beer (or two if you are short) open
mosquito net in front of van.  Pry off plastic caps on rear cap nuts and remove.
7.  Call for wife.  &quot;This is really effin important, I NEED HELP NOW&quot;
8.  With wife's help carefully remove luggage rack.  Put on ground and clean
carefully.
9.  Have a beer; you are about half done.
10.  That first one tasted good; have another one.
11.  Clean roof with soap and brush.  Wax roof.  Clean luggage rack.  Tell
everyone  (especially wife) about the incredible mess.
12.  Notice that some ofthe screws, that stick out of the roof in the rear
appear loose.  Put a dab of silicone or calking on them to hold them
temporarily and wait for 30 min.
12.  Carefully, with help (you know who) replace roof.  Put it carefully
over those rear screws and put on the nuts.
13.  Now try to replace the four original screws.  Hah.  Three go in but the
forth won't.  Remove all screws and bent roof bracket.  Try screws again.
Hah, no luck.  Wonder if roof will fly off with only 3 screws. Not sure?
Take all the screws, put one in pocket and throw remaining three (or
whatever you have left) and throw into the woods.  If you live in the city,
dump down manhole.
14.  Take remaining screw to metric fastener store and purchase many
stainless steel phillips head machine screws of the same thread and large
washers.  Use four of each to reattach roof and place remaining stash in
garage on top of beer cases to admire when wife has visitors over.
15.  Smile smugly when you see other westys with what you know are
disgusting messes under ther luggage roofs.

Good Luck, Lloyd
