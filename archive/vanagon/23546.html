Subject: Vanagon motor swap???

SO's '86 tossed part of a connecting rod cap through the top of the case...
Have located a '90 waterboxer (expensive, but...).

?1.  What problems will I have if I swap the '90 motor into the '86 Vanagon?
	( I will have both Brain Boxes)

?2.  Would I be better off installing a 2.0 liter air-cooled?

Any info will help.
