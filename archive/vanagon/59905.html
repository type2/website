Subject: '84 leaking oil

I know less than nothing about matters automotive but still love my Westy
(1984, 71,000 original miles), an incendiary combination unless you happen
to be rich (which I'm not). Anyway, I've been reading this list and trying
to learn and I think I'm in trouble . . .

My '84 came out of storage and made a quick visit to our local mechanic for
inspection, oil change and the annual &quot;See anything we should be worried
about?&quot;

Well, we took it out over the weekend and found that we are leaking oil.
Three hours after running we have a stain the size of a basketball on our
driveway. A cursory look at the engine doesn't show anything for someone
who doesn't know what he is looking for. Underneath it seems there's oil on
all kinds of things.

I guess I'm going to call my mechanic and make an appointment. It sure
would be helpful to have a little clue before I do. Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,
Bruce
