Subject: 89 SYNCRO engine hestaition 

I have just returned from a trip to Montreal from Marblehead MA. A pesky
gremblin that has been present since purchased new in 89 returns again. The
engine after 2 or more hours of running begins to short circuit as if some
electrical nanosec stoppage distrupts smooth running. I have tried drygas
on most occasions with some luck. AM confused if problem is water in gas,
bad gas bought on trips, or this some mysterious electrical black box
gremblin. any thoughts would be welcome.
