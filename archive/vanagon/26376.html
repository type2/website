Subject: Re: Vans in europe?

An English friend of mine said there used to be a bridge in or
near London where traveling Australians would hang out, buying
and selling VW buses.  Apparently they got hounded out of
that area, but I'm sure they just moved somewhere else.  Any
UKers or Aussies know any more?
