Subject: Unusual cases in a/c engine


A French bug featured in this months VolksWorld has an
interesting 2276cc motor. Interesting, cause the cases are forged
in France by some guy who builds VW based aero engines and doesn't
appear to rate the AS21/41 cases. No details of any differences
are given, but a set of his cases will cost 900 pounds, so they had 
better be good.

The full engine spec for this bug is 82mm Pauter crank, Carrillo
con rods, 94mm barrels and pistons, Engle (???) FK89 a-like cam,
ARPM Superflo heads, 46*36 (don't know which dimensions this refers
to?) valves, some kind of multiple spark ignition system and
twin Weber 48IDA carbs.

With all that lot it would be nice to get some kind of idea of the HP
produced, but none is given. However the compression ratio is given as 
11.5:1! This thing appears to be mainly aimed at the strip, but
an engine like that would make going up hills in the bus somewhat
easier. Even if it did only last for five minutes and eat petrol
faster than the bus does now....

cheers
