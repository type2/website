Subject: Re: WD-40 starting fluid

&gt;&gt;WD40 is the absolute best starter fluid there is... anyone know if it's
&gt;&gt;true (or dangerous, or damaging)?
&gt;
&gt;Works fine for my snowblower :), don't know about damage :( Tim

works fine as a starting fluid for me too.

as it is somewhat volatile it has been now to turn into &quot;flame from hell&quot;
if i get a bit over zelous (sp?) and spray a tonne of it in the carbie..

michael &quot;now where did i put that magnesium....&quot;
