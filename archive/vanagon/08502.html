Well, it looks like we know have a plan for our little gathering.
I have a, um, question: why can't I find this place in the Palo Alto
directory??  It worries me.  I am wondering when David C. last knew
of its existence and if it is possibly going by another name now.

Talk about yer monkey-wrenches!  I hope I simply missed something...
If it does turn out to be a mirage, we could try Stuft Pizza (which _is_ in
the directory) in Mountain View or Star Pizza (small, but they have a great
Greek pizza) in Menlo Park.
