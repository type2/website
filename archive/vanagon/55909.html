Subject: Re: Oldest Vanagon on the list??

Jim - and all,

I would like to know who has the latest Vanagon on the list! That is, one of
the last models made?

The VIN from my '91 Westy, Greta, is: WV2ZB0251MG009895.

&gt; Vanatics,
&gt; I was wondering who has the oldest Vanagon on the list?  If you have a 1980
&gt; Vanagon and would like to see if your's is the oldest on the list, send your
&gt; VIN (vehicle identification number) to me.  I'll keep a list and let the
&gt; whole list know the result.  BTW, Skip Montanaro's WWW page shows that VIN:
&gt; 24A-0013-069 was the first 1980 Vanagon produced.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you're reading this from the Type2 list, please email me directly, since I
&gt; don't subscribe to that list.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Jim Davis
