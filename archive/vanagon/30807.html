Subject: spare tire window wash

Hello,
	I have a '73 camper van with a window wash resivoir that won't 
hold any pressure for longer than one day.  I have heard of one solution 
that involved connecting the spare tire air valve to the resivoir.  I 
assumed the spare tire was on the front of the van as it is on mine.  Has 
anyone ever done this and if so, how was it done?

Thanks,

Charley
