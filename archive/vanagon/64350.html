&gt;The compartment under the drivers seat contains not as I expected a jack
&gt;or tire iron, but another battery which appears at initial observation
&gt;to be connected into my system. Anyone  know how this setup works? Does
&gt;it function as a backup in case the one under the passenger seat fails,
&gt;or just give me more duration for running appliances?

I believe that this second battery is only connected to the fridge.  It
charges while the ignition is turned on, and is isolated when the ignition
is turned off.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
