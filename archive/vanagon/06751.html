&gt; Looking for a ride down the coast to Martha's Flannel Jamboree. I am
&gt; located in Felton, about 12 miles off of Hwy 17. I have a tent that I
&gt; will be using, so I don't need a place to sleep. I generally read in a
&gt; car, so I should be quiet the whole trip (unless you want to talk).

I'm willing to pick up anyone that wants a ride between Hayward and there. 
It sounds like Felton is on the way, right?  I have seat belts for 5.  I
don't have a camper so I was planing on bringing a tent and using it, or
sleeping on the rear bench. 

&gt; My Westy is non-operational, so please help this poor soul out :)

Well, mine isn't a westy, but it'll let you see how much fun a split 
window bus is.  And my heater even works... at least it keeps my feet 
warm with out fumigating me.
