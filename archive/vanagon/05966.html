Subject: re:My bus engine(again)

I have just rebuilt a 2.0L engine and also assumed that I could rebuild it for 
$700 or $800.  
My engine is from a 78 westfalia and is fuel injected.  No real problems 
rebuilding other than parts are expensive for that engine. I also replaced my 
clutch and pressure plate while I had the engine out since they were worn.  
You probably should budget closer to $1400 to $1500 for the rebuild.  I had to 
replace a head on mine as it was damaged, so you may get by a little cheaper

        I have had the engine out of my bus since August.  After tearing
the lil 2.0L apart, I 'found' that the mains were gone, the cam worn
out, lifters worn, heads needed redone, needs new wrist pin bushings,
and of course new pistons and cylinders.


        So basically, my question is, rebuild this engine?
        Or buy a remanufactured one?

        I think the rebuild would cost about $700-800ish, possibly
more.  I am a bit leary of remanufactured engines for some reason.
The warranty for 12,000 miles would last me about 4 months....not
exactly what I would call a long time.


        I would like about 80k out of it....am I dreaming?
