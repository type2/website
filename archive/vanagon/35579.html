Subject: Re:Surf bus for sale

&gt;&gt;I've got a nice 65 deluxe 21 window VW bus filled with fond memories of 
&gt;&gt;chilly dawn patrols in Morro Bay.  Now I live in Idaho and it don't work 
&gt;&gt;so good for backcountry snowboard expeditions.  Its for sale if anybody's 

&gt;Later

&gt;Thom Fitzpatrick

I've checked this one out (via email anyway) it sounds in reasonable shape but
he wants US$7000 for it - I have a couple of paras of description if anyone's
interested.
