Subject: Re[2]: The water heater project - Steven

     Steven,
     
     &gt;Oops!  Re-read you message (after I replied, of course) and noticed 
     &gt;the 80 mile commute part.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, still you 
     &gt;should have your control flaps installed and working with the 
     &gt;thermostat if you want decent heat.  Other than that, the seals in 
     &gt;your windows/doors should be in good shape and sealing to retain the 
     &gt;heat.
     
     Hmm, well I have a brand new engine as well, oh and brand new window 
     and door seals as well. Basically I've got a brand new '64 bus as far 
     as things that ware out are concerned.
     
     I just think that the system is poorly designed. Take the windsheild
     demist vents. They simply weren't designed, just added. This makes me
     think that they didn't give much thought about heating a bug bus 
     inside.
     
     Lee.
