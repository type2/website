Subject: Calif. GNATT route?
Date: Mon, 5 Jun 95 17:52:13 PDT

  Has anyone spoken with David Schwarze recently? I was thinking of going to
  the GNATT meeting point in the Yosemite high country, but, according to 
  road conditions report on the WWW, Hwy 120 is still closed between Crane
  Flat and Hwy 395! 

  Is anyone aware of GNATT route changes due to this?
