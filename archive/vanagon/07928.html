Subject: Shifter Jams

	Hello again.  I have a shifter problem I hope someone out there can 
help me diagnose.  Sometimes when I shift into 3rd gear, it appears that 
the spring loaded pin that fits into the ball end at the base of the 
shifter pops out of the shift linkage socket, causing my shift lever to get 
hung up in 3rd.  I have to remove the shift plate bolts and position the 
shifter ball in the socket each time this happens.  When it first happened, 
right after I bought the bus (oh, it's a '71 Westy) I replaced the shifter 
lever and front shifter linkage piece with used ones I had around, thinking 
it was a case of worn ball or socket or pin or spring.  After a few 
attempts at correctly installing the 2nd shifter it seemed to work OK and 
so I thought I found the problem.  A few weeks ago, I replaced my rear 
shift bushing and cage (worn and bent) and the jamming problem came back.  
It happens every now and then if I thoughtlessly shift too far into the 3rd 
position, but today it happened unpredictably.  I was wondering if wear on 
the front shifter linkage bushing (which I never replaced because I didn't 
know of its existence till I read a Rocky Mountain Motorworks catalog) 
would cause something like this to happen or if there is something more 
menacing lurking in my shift linkage.  I ordered the bushing today, but I 
have not examined the old one to see its condition (for only $2 who 
cares?).
	I'm guessing that it's this worn bushing (or lack thereof) that is 
causing the front shift linkage to sit just a little too low, allowing the 
ball to pop out of the socket when I shift to 3rd.  But I don't know for 
sure...Well, anyone out there ever have something similar?

Thanks,
