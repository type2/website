Subject: Oil Cooler Foam Question
Date: Sun, 13 Aug 1995 19:37:42 -0500 (CDT)

In the never ending quest to someday drive my bus again I hauled my 
lazy butt out to the garage this afternoon in 100 degree weather and 
did some wrenching.  I did come up against a problem.  What else?

This is a stock '71 1600DP in a bus.  It has the upright oil cooler.  
I have the foam glued on there that goes up over the top and down both
sides.  However, one of my manuals shows a piece that also wraps 
around the lower end of the cooler.  I don't remember now if it was 
Bentley or Haynes.  It said something like, &quot;later models also have 
this piece one the cooler...&quot;  The old cooler didn't have this piece 
andneither does this new one.  Is this something I need to have or can
I llive without it?  Where can I get one or fabricate one if I do have
to to have it?  Thanks, Jim
