&gt; Well, I'm interested.  Can you estimate the number of hours to travel
&gt; from Sac. as well as the number of hours from a point in the bay
&gt; area so I know how much travel time I need to account for?

Red Rock looks to be about 350 miles from both San Francisco and 
Sacramento.  All interstate.

I also know another place that is really nice, but it is in the mountains
instead of the desert.  It is in the Inyo National Forest just East of
the Tule River Indian Reservation.  There is a beautiful campground 
there called Peppermint and a great hike nearby to an overlook point,
which consists of a small house perched on top of a large rock.  It is
really an amazing sight - worth the whole trip just to see it.  This
place is 225 miles of interstate from SF and Sac and then about 40 miles
of (sometimes) steep winding mountain highway.  Anyone else been here?
Oh the campgrounds at Peppermint and Red Rock have pit toilets and no
showers, but are only a few dollars a night.  They are very clean though,
especially Red Rock.

&gt; The reason I'm asking is because I don't think I can afford any
&gt; more vacation days if I want to do the N. American tour later
&gt; in May.  Sooo... I don't want too long of a drive just for a
&gt; weekend.  

No kidding.  My odometer reads 880 miles more than it did last Thursday.
Good thing I was able to listen to the Chargers game on the radio or I
would have been really bored on the drive back...  :)
