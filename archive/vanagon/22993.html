&gt;&gt;the band is PHISH...they seem destined to be the 'next' grateful dead...
&gt;&gt;Can't you imagine kids following them around in aging Chrysler mini-vans
&gt;&gt;over the next 25 years?

When I test drove the '87 it was covered in nice Dead &amp; Phish window 
stickers. When I bought it the salesguy had cleared everything off it. Kinda 
sad, liked them, my 5 year old noticed they were missing too. My '85 that 
was barren of stickers is now loaded with dead and others. Deadheads have 
made the leap from micros to breadloafs to vanagon, I can't see skipping 
Eurovans to get to Chryslers, but then again they're the same thing aren't 
they? :) tim s.

HoHoHo let the flames fly high. Gotta go now, the ethernet card is heating 
up, my harddisc is beginning to curl at the edges. Is that Ric serving up 
torte? 
Stay tuned for next Fridays flame bait: Barndoors, who cares?
