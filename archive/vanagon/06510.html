Subject: Van Street

Tooled into our quiet little subdivision (The Meadows of Reproduction) last
night to see a new addition - a white panel van in a driveway down the
street.  With my wife's Vanagon and my Bozobus our front, I began to wonder
if we could get the remaining empty, new houses to only look good to
Volkswagen owners with some kind of spell...

My mother-in-law has been pressuring my wife to have me paint the Bozobus
white, so that it won't lower the property values.  I wonder if this will
put more pressure on her (or me), or should I help our neighbor make
his/her van more entertaining?

It was an odd beastie.  Couldn't see the front, but it looked like a
'72-'77 kinda body style, except for the slightly-higher-than-normal roof.
It was also in just-off-the-showroom condition.  Later, I watched (and
heard) it drive away - it had a Rabbit engine!  This was a Mexican-made
bus!  I wish I'd gotten a look at the front (for that radiator) or the
license plate to see what country it was from.  If they could teach me the
trick for importing these...

the '67 isn't a rickshaw anymore - but I'm gonna make an MPEG movie
of running it down the street with my four-year-old driving :-)
