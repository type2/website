('67s don't have firewalls, Clara? The engines are in the cargo bay? The
split-window Type II must be a primitive beast indeed!)(Any seal that can't
balance a beach ball on its nose is something up with which I will not put,
even if I have to swat the flywheel.)
-------

Bubble window buses have a removable firewall betweenthe motor and the gas
tank.    These are not present, for VWs own reason (like they didn't bother)
 in the split, and it was to that I was referring.

the term &quot;main engine seal&quot;  is usually used to mean the main seal behind the
flywheel.   What I now understand it to be used here as I call the engine to
body seal, which I think is more clear.  Sorry for any confusion.


My friend's dog will jump three feet in the air for a treat (pizza crust will
do).  I suggested he be renamed Flipper.   Beach balls come next........
