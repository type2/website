........................................ end ...........................
 that is, the dimension of the bottom hole is 118mm x 102mm (4-5/8in x
 4in). but the front edge of the hole is 216mm (8-1/2in) above the
 bottom edge of the trim panel, while the rear edge of the hole is
 245mm (9-5/8in) from that same edge.  that is, the hole is slightly
 tilted. the upper hole is 67mm x 38mm (2-5/8in x 1-1/2in) and appears
 also to be slightly tilted. the upper hole has its bottom front edge
 442mm (17-3/8in) from the bottom edge of the trim panel.

notice that the instructions do NOT say anything about those two 22mm
(7/8in) holes. both are 31mm (1-1/4in) from the closest edge of the trim
panel. the lower of the two is 203mm (8-1/8in) from the bottom edge,
while the upper of the two holes is 298mm (11-3/4in) above that same
bottom edge.

i have no idea what those holes are supposed to be used for.
