Subject: propane life

well it has been some seven months now and my propane tank has just gone 
empty after daily use, usually just once a day, but sometimes twice.  and 
of course I have finals tomorrow so it is cold sandwiches for me.
The reason I bring this up is because of thread that went be during the 
summer regarding the propane life.  BTW, I have the fridge on 110.
