Subject: Steering gear


Hello all,

On my 70 bus, the steering is binding.  The effect is particularly noticeable 
when I am parallel parking.  This is because the bus is completely stopped 
when I am turning the steering wheel (very difficult).  When moving the 
problem is not so apparent.  Now, I have located the source of the problem  
which is the worm gear? connecting the steering wheel column to the front 
wheels and have loosened the gear according to the idiots guide.  This action 
has helped some but I fear the problem is to get worse.  According to the 
idiots guide breakdown of the gear should be left to the dealer ( aghh!)
Does any one have any experience with this problem.  Is it really that bad or 
can I break it down myself on the work bench.  Is it advisable to get a used 
one or rebuilt, i understand they are rare......or is there fluid in there 
that I let get too low ?  Goodthoughts anyone
                                                                       
TIA

John
