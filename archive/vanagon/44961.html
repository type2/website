I don't think Fischer and Berg made a &quot;boo-boo&quot;.  These guys are more
expert than you or I could ever hope to be.  They know vw engines and have
experimented with all kinds of senders.  If they say it, I'm not going to
argue with them.  Maybe Porsche goofed.  Or maybe Porsche's sysetem is
different and compensates for the sump &quot;too cool&quot; reading.

Also, you are wrong, the dipstick doesn't just read just from the tip.  It
gets it's reading from the whole length of the stick, and therefore, it
gets a wider range of coverage.  Rather than just from the bottom of the
sump.

I'll stick with Berg and co.  I believe everything else they've said, I
will give them my faith in this too.  Plus, I don't like to take chances,
rebuilds are a pain in the butt.

But, of cousre, it is YOUR (all of us) personal decision.  Put the sender
where you want.

&gt;Did you know that the tip of the dipstick is less than an inch from where
&gt;the sender would be if it were mounted in the sump plate?  It's true.  If
&gt;you remove the sump plate and look up in there, you will see the tip of the
&gt;dipstick.  It's right there ('72 - '82 air cooled type IV engines).
