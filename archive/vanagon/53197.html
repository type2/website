&gt;&gt; I believe I have an 094 transmission, though I haven't double checked that.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Tell me the name of your shop.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Hi Derek:  The shop I work with is Mendeola Racing. (mmmsocal_at_juno_dot_com)
&gt;Mike has been building trannys for off road race cars since the
&gt;beginning of Baja racing in the late 60's. I do some machine work for
&gt;him. In the December 96 issue of Hot VWs there is a article about a new
&gt;tranny he developed using a 10 inch ring gear. There are pictures of the
&gt;differential and bearing carriers that I machined for him. Mike builds
&gt;the transmissions for the fast attack vehicles that the Navy Seals
&gt;use(basicly a 3 seat buggy with a machine gun on top). He uses a 091
&gt;transmission and cuts/welds the pinion shaft to accomodate use of tranny
&gt;gears from a 002 in these boxes. The Navy pounds the boxes and he does
&gt;not get them back broken.  Just the other day He was telling me that the
&gt;Navy doesn't pound the boxes like the off-roaders do though. The off
&gt;road racers usally have to change ring and pinion after a few races
&gt;because they won't pass mag. The gears themselves start to crack. The
&gt;weld always holds up though.  I think Mike is the only one that does
&gt;this welding process  and all of the other tranny shops buy from him. He
&gt;is thinking of developing the new transmission to make it usable for
&gt;4wd. The military is interested in a 4wd version buggy.    Feel free to
&gt;e-mail him and you can tell him I put you on to him if you like. As you
&gt;can probably tell by now I think Mike is about the best in the buisness.
&gt;
