Subject: Southern New England Drive-in Nite



Ok, here it is...the VW Van lists Drive-in nite is tentatively set for 
Sunday, August 18, at the Rustic Drive-in, North Smithfield, RI about 15 
miles north of Providence RI on RT 146. I say it is tentative in that I 
will have to find out what is playing next weekend, as the three VWers that 
have decided to go (including myself) want to go only if there is a &quot;family 
movie&quot;. This shouldn't be a problem as the Rustic has three screens.

I will post a meeting place, time and movie sometime next week. If you are 
interested, e-mail me.

Ric
