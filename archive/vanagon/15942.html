Just some quick thoughts...

That interesting, a Wolfsburg edition with no sink or stove, but has
pop-top, is this some kind of &quot;weekender&quot;


&gt; 1. The oil light came on after the engine was hot and at idle.
&gt;    What does that indicate?
low pressure, worn bearings.

&gt; 2. The rear chrome bumper has surface rust.
&gt;    How much does a replacement bumper cost?
I have to guess that it would be cheaper to have it rechromed.

&gt; 3. The body looks solid, but has a dent on the driver side and
&gt;    has some surface rust.
Check carefully for rust under the van.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. The driver seat is tatered.
&gt;    Are seat covers or replacement seats available?
I've stiched up the originals, not a long term solution.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Part of the pop top seal has separated from the fiberglass.
&gt;    How much does a new seal cost?
West Coast Metric makes replacements, about $150 (Canadian) for the big
one, much, much, cheaper than VW. Its supposed to have aluminum instead of
steel clips so that it won't rust out like the originals, but I don't know
if they fir aswell as the originals.

&gt; 6. The ride was a little soft.
&gt;    How much for shocks or struts? I don't know what type is used on 
&gt;    Vanagons.

No struts, just shocks, various prices. Easy to replace the rears, more of
a pain to replace the fronts.
