Subject: Syncro oil pressure switchs


      Ok another technical Question.....
    I can't figure out the bentley description of how the oil 
    pressure switchs are suppose to work at all. It's just a  simple
    switch, witch means my 1987 edition of the book has to be wrong! 

    Right now I have no oil light at all, any time.
    Can someone tell me if both switches should be grounded with no
    oil pressure, (engine off)? 

    I think I have a bad switch in the rear of the engine. I also have
    a oil leak from that area.  What  is the best way to get to the 
    switch?
