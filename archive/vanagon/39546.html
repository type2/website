&gt;I have had an external oil cooler installed under the floor of my '72 
&gt;bus. It is parallel to the floor.
&gt;
&gt;As it was installed before my oil temp guage, I don't know what 
&gt;difference it made to engine temps. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm planning on making a scoop from some softish metal alloy used for 
&gt;flashings in houses and to also fit a fan between the cooler and the 
&gt;floor to increase the air flow through the cooler. The fan will be switched
&gt;on by me rather than a thermostat.

If it is a tube and fin type, its benifit is probably minimal.  Oil does not
cool well in these things.  A flat plate cooler properly sized and given good
air flow will require a thermostat. Dennis.
