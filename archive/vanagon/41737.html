Subject: Hydrolic lifters- 81'

I finally got all my parts in and put the motor back in (including 
new pilot bearing) and can't get the lifters to prime. I went thru 
the procedure in the Bently on the initial settings, but they still 
won't quiet down. Any ideas or tricks? I've got 20W50 in, is it too 
thick? Help I've already missed the best spring camping.
Thanks
