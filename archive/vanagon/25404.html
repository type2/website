&gt; I have an '80 standard (no stove, ref.) Westy with the full width rear seat
&gt; and side seat.  According to my manual, the rear seat setup's one of the
&gt; differences between the standard and deluxe models.  I could be wrong but I
&gt; don't think it's because of the year.  There is a hidden stash box under the
&gt; seat though.  
Yeah, but this one had a fridge and stove just as on all the others,&gt;  and
the water tank, plus a jump seat. Up until then I had only seen the jump
seat behind the passenger.
