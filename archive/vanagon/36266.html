Subject: RE: high energy ignition

Sami -
When I saw your post I looked in JCW and was surprised not to see the CD
ignition I bought from them.  It was inexpensive and &quot;universal&quot; in that
it is triggered by the points, but puts only triggering voltage across
the points so it has nearly the &quot;set it, forget it&quot; characteristic of 
photo or hall-effect triggering.  It also has a reversible plug that lets
you return to normal points-and-condensor operation, for diagnostic pur-
poses.  (Except that the tach sender connects one spot in CD mode, another
spot in normal mode, I found.)  I used it on the 2.2l Porsche engine when
that was in my 81 Vgon, so I know it's good for six cylinders, presume it's
good for four.

If you want, I'll see if I have the manufacturer's info.
