Hi folx,

I have two questions today:

First, what is the procedure for replacing a non-windshield window?
Is it pretty much the same as the windshield procedure?  I.e., the
cord wrapped inside the window seal, one person inside pulling the
cord, and one person outside pushing?  I need to replace the sliding
window in the cargo door of a 78.  On a scale of 1 (v. difficult) to
10 (v. easy), how would you rate the difficulty of this?  It *sounds*
easy, but what problems am I likely to run into?

Second, what are the most common causes of a spark plug that
repeatedly works itself loose?  This is a bus I just bought last
weekend, and I've discovered this twice now on #3 sparkplug.  I can
tell it's loose when it starts making a chirping noise like someone
else was describing on his 81 Vanagon; I go back and check, and sure
enough, it's loose again.  Tighten it down, and the chirping subsides
considerably (although not altogether).

Thanks,
Rodney
