Subject: Re: Front wheel bearings (rabbits)

Jonathan,
Were you able to get a look at the contraption they used?  I've never 
seen one and the picture in the &quot;Recycled Bugs&quot; catalog leaves alot to 
the imagination.  A description of the device might be enough for me to 
fab something up for the next go-round of bearings.

I had already assumed that the wheel and the CV joint would need to be 
pulled so I'm not surprised that it took them 45 minutes/side.

&gt; them about 45 minutes to replace a bearing.  There is still quite a bit of 
&gt; work to do even with the puller.  If I had done it myself it would probably
&gt; taken me all day.  It also helps to have the car up on a lift.  The best thing
&gt; about it that the entire housing does not have to be taken off.  The labor was
&gt; $40 for each replacement.  I supplied the bearings which are about $23 each.
