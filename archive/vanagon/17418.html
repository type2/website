Subject: diff lock shaft madness (syncro)

Ok Tim, now that I've encouraged you to get into diff lock shaft madness
enter a little further here and tell me what you think. 

As you know, I have purchased a new front diff with the factory diff lock in
it. But the unit's vacume servo unit was smashed in shipping and I had to
buy a spare one. 

But the spare one did not have the rubber seals/boots that go between the
vacume servo and the diff and the original seals were torn on the servo that
was smashed in shipping. 

I am told by one person that VW won't sell these rubber seals but I cannot
believe this. I study the manual and I think I see where the seals are
identified--on a page totally separate from the page where the diff or
vacume servo is located. 

The seals in question are two--one is rust colored and the other is black. 

Now, take a look at your microfiche and tell me which you think are those
seals. These parts appear on plates: 
42-10
136-05
 71

Ref, Description, Part number, Price

54  Sealing Washer  094 301 190 ($8.35)
54  Sealing Washer  094 301 190 A ($8.35)

53  Bush  094 301 213 B ($37.90)

52  Sealing Washer N 902 621 01 ($0.38)

Which do you think is the red seal and which do you think is the black one
of whether I have identified the correct seals?
