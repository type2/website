&gt; Ummm... are you talking about the one on the front disc brakes?  That
&gt; one comes out real easy once you pull the two pins out... or is it some
&gt; other clip?

On the rear brakes of my '85 vanagon there is a spring loaded clip on 
each side shoe.  Once you remove these three or four times (don't ask) 
they aren't so hard to get back replace.  Basically, I took a pair of 
pliers half opened and pinched the little metal &quot;shield&quot; and spring in 
one hand.  Then reached around and held the little pin in place with the 
other hand and ....PUUUUUUUUSHED...  
The tricky part is that the catch is a kind of needle and eye thing.  You 
have to push the pin through and then somehow turn it 180o so it 
catches.  With the spring loading it isn't so easy.  I shot the damn 
&quot;shield&quot; across most of Florida today and killed several small innocent 
woodland creatures ; )
