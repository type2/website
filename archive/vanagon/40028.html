Subject: Page with Free DC Splittie Pictures
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

I finished up a quick web page last night that has pictures of 
the free DC splittie. Its at: 
 
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan 
 
It was late and there was some e-mail confusion last night when 
I posted a reply to Clara to the whole list. Sorry.
