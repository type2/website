Hello,

I just got my 83 wasserwesty inspected and the mechanic who did the
adjustments said that one on the cylinders was a bit weak. The numbers were
around 150 for cyl 1,2,4 and around 110 for cylinder 3. Can someone break
the news to me of how long the motor will survive like this. The mechanic
said it should be alright, but I think he could read my face and didn't
want me to drop dead in his garage. I really wan to know so that I can plan
ahead. The v'gon has lots of power and runs very well. (the idle is pretty
smooth too!) Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
dave
