&gt; However, NC is a bit too far for me to travel for a weekend, and
&gt; I suspect others up here in NE. So.....
&gt; howabout the handfull of us up here, anyone interested in getting
&gt; together?

I am sure that we could &quot;scare-up&quot; some wingnuts to do this, however,
I might suggest we do a little waiting...like until...the Summer.

Of course, without Martha, the 3-course dinner will be Lager, Pilsner,
and Stout...

I am going through a midlife crisis and switching career fields, so I
wouldn't be able to attend until summer anyway. :-(
