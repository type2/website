Subject: turn signal blinker, More Mermen tour dates

	So my '70 pickup (Little Martha)'s turn signals changed symptoms
slightly. I haven't gotten the new emergency flasher switch installed but
will get it from Antonio VW's parts dept. this weekend.
	Used to be, signalling a turn produced blinking lights BUT the
green arrow indicators in the left-'instrument' face would light steadily.
Now, at first, BOTH the exterior lamps AND the instrument indicator blink,
and the sound of the blinker is louder. Then the sound get softer and the
indicator stays on without blinking. 
	Cycling the emergency blinker switch on and off still causes the 
green interior indicators to go out once the turn signal is cancelled.
The emergency blinker still doesn't work, still, however.
	This is still telling me to change the switch, but can anyone
relate these symptoms to their experinces? Is the blinker bad TOO?

	The steel wool joke is from my friend Karl Pedersen.
