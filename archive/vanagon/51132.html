&gt; 1978 VW Bus, with Porsche Engine(2 Liter).
&gt; Runs OK, $1500.00 OBO
&gt; 
Hey, is there any difference between the typeIV engines used in 914's,
411's and type2's?  I always assumed they were the same, and was going to
flame this with a &quot;Don't they all&quot; message.  Thinking about it, though,
I don't really know if there is a difference.  Vanagons have some slight
differences from the bus versions (like the exhaust mounting on the heads).
Anybody familiar with the changes over the years and the differences in
the versions used in the different models?  I was once told that the 914
was sold in Europe as a VW not a Porsche, as the follow-on to the Karmen
Ghia.   Fiction?
