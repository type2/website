Subject:       Re: Syncro trans probs

Hello Jim.  

With my ' 90 Syncro, I often go from LOW to 1ST with little problem.  
Just have to wait for the lever to pop up from Low to neutral, and 
then go into 1ST.  It's a balky move, but I have managed to get used 
to it by just going slow with the stick.

I usually never go into 1ST while moving... I believe the gearing is 
too low to downshift into smoothly.

You always have to push down on the lever going into reverse or LOW.

Hope this helps
Harry.

&gt; My 87 Syncro has had a problem getting into 1ST since I bought it 4 years
&gt; ago.  I can get it into 1ST only when traveling VERY slowly or stopped.  I
&gt; can't seem to make a LOW to 1ST gear transition either.  When I use LOW, I
&gt; live with shifting from LOW to 2ND and skipping 1ST altogether.  I do however
&gt; need to push down on the stick to reach LOW or REVERSE.  I too, would love to
&gt; hear a solution for this problem.
