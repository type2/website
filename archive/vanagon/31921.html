&gt; It's a lovely story about your 75 subaru wagon, but the transplant we 
&gt; are discussing is a 93 Subaru engine, which provides 130HP and should 
&gt; be cheaper to maintain than a 1.9L waterboxer.

FWIW, Subaru has a 2.5 155HP they are putting in '96 Automatic Outback 
Wagons...

If you could find a wrecked one...
