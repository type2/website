So Mark McCulley says:
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone other than Tom basking in the warm glow of a new Propex furnace
&gt; yet? Or are you all waiting for summer like me because you don't have a
&gt; garage and it's always dark, raining, or too cold to work outside. If you
&gt; have installed the furnace, how long did it take?
&gt; 

Gawd Mark!  Did I post my Propex posts for nothing?!  I had mine running
at the CCC's get together last September and it did quite well.  Only 
problem was, I had a weak battery and by morning I'd need a jump start.
