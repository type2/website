Subject: FS: 15 inch alloys/tires

For sale five 15 x 7 inch alloys with correct bolt pattern and offset for
Vanagon.  Lug nuts, wheel locks included.
Fresh (3-4 thousand miles) LT215/75R-15C BF Goodrich T/A All Terrain tires-
especially good for syncro enthusiasts.  These were as big as I could fit
them without rubbing.
$1250
Wheel style roughly similar to Vanagon stock alloys.
Wheels made in Brazil- Rodao brand.
I'm selling the wheels because I've &quot;replaced&quot; my syncro with a 4wd truck
and put the original 14&quot; steel wheels back on prior to selling it --(of
course there's no real substitute for a Vanagon).  San Francisco Bay Area.
