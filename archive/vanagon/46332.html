Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

Gerry,

I appreciate the effort someone else is going to put into an aircooled van 
list...however, I think that there has ALWAYS been something special on this 
list which transcends air v water v T1 vT2 v T3 v T4 vans, and I would hate 
to see this disapear when the split window/loaf/early brick crowd has spun 
off onto another list....

You said that this is in partial response to those who had problems with the 
amount of traffic....to those I say (to play on H. Truman)...&quot;If you can't 
stand the traffic, get off the list&quot;. 

There are much more of us out there, I'm sure, who like the list and how it 
is run, and who would rather have the list stay the way it has always been 
handled.

Could you please make the split optional? Besides, think of poor Richard 
Palmer, he'll have to scrap his stock of V_at_L shirts and have to revert to 
ones with late Vanagons and EVs only.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T SPLIT THE LIST!!!

I'll buy you extra beer!!!!!!


We are loosing our sense of &quot;community&quot; here....


Ric
