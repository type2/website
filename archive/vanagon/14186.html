Subject: Re[2]: 6v wipers on 12v bus


For a 6V gas gauge and clock your best and easiest solution is to buy a
'universal converter' available at Radio shack, Kmart, waal-mart for under
$10.00 -- you can never get it that cheap.  The wipers are a different story
due to the sheer power they need off of the 6V converter...

&gt;   Please send me a wiring diagram.  I am assuming that this is something I could 
&gt;   use for a 6-volt gas gauge and possibly a clock as well?  Thanks!
