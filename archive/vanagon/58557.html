&gt;PS:  Oh - the little button on the Handbrake activates the Brake Warning
&gt;Light when the Handbrake is in use - push the button (which happens when
&gt;releasing the Handbrake) and the light goes out.

now that's odd.  On my 3 vanagons and in the Bentley manual that button
releases the parking brake only.  The light goes out when the lever reaches
the floor and presses on the switch. very odd ;).  Tim
