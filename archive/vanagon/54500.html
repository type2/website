Well, you don't HAVE to remove the hub.  The hub and drum on the Vanagon 
are &quot;split&quot;, so you can remove the drum without removing the hub.  It's 
slightly harder to get at everything withoug removing the hub, but I'll 
bet that's the way any brake shop in the world would go about replacing 
the lining.  Besides, that way you don't need a giant socket, a hub 
puller and a breaker bar capable of 360 ft-lbs.

Maybe you already knew all this, but I'd hate to see you go to the extra 
work and expense of pulling the hub if it's not really needed.
