&gt;     There is a 1984 Westfalia Wolfsburg Edition for sale on a lot near my 
&gt;     house.  It has been there for probably two months now.  I think the 
&gt;     reasons why may be that it has 105K miles, and they are asking $8995! 
&gt;     It looks as though the owners took REAL good care of it.  I am just 
&gt;     worried about the mileage.  Does anyone have an idea as to how much a 
&gt;     rebuild costs for a waterboxer?  Does anyone also have an idea as to 
&gt;     what would be an acceptable price?  Thanks

Figuer worst case about $2200 at the dealer for the engine.  Instalation,
hoses, belts, mounts exhaust etc. extra.  Should go another 50K if taken care
of.
Dennis.
