&gt;	One point I just noticed:
&gt;
&gt;TireRack lists Michelin LTX 195/75 14 in two ways:
&gt;
&gt;LTX M/S LT 195/75 R14 C
&gt;&amp;
&gt;LTX M/S P 195/75 SR 14 RWL
&gt;
&gt;Obviously these two have some differences. Which tire does you page mean?
 
You would want the LT version. They're rated at 1435 lbs _at_ 50psi.  I have a
set of these on my syncro westy--they are fine tires in my opinion, but not
cheap. Great in snow, but if you're doing much off-road travel, you might
want to check out BFG All Terrain T/A or Yokohama Y370.
