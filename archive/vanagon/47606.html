Subject: Parts Sources??

I've got an '87 Westy Syncro...

I just broke the drain cap for the internal (potable) water tank, and I was
already missing the drain cap (for the sink drain).

Does anyone have a source for parts such as these, or are they only
available through the dealer (or do dealers even have this stuff?)?

In fact, if someone has an unabridged (!) list of part sources which they
consider mandatory (and if possible firms to avoid too!), I and the rest of
the list community would be most grateful.

BTW whats FLAPS that I keep reading about? I'm assuming its a West Coast
thing, since as far as I know there's no flaps around here in New Jersey.

Thanks!
