Subject: VW ijnsult and Brick Trip


I fear I have screwed up again.  I accidently posted this
on vintage vw board.  I hope they other type VW owners
don't start pounding down our doors to attend the trip.

Hello

to read it, or send this Chucklehead some mail

He obviously does not appreciate any of the finer qualities of a
Bus.
He must be a chevy grease monkey without a clue or something
