Subject: Springfield, MO: June Bug Jamboree

Hi All

On June 17th there will be the 1st annual 'June Bug Jamboree' in 
Springfield, Missouri (SW Missouri, USA) put on by G.R.O.O.V.E.

 'General Registry Of Ozark Volkswagen Enthusiasts'--How's that for an 
acronym!

The deadline for entries is June 10th, so if you're interested contact 
the one of the following folks:  Tim Laffoon (417)882-7162
                                 Bob Hufford (417)833-2047

Over 20 classes including 'long distance' and 'beater' (rusty &amp; 
crusty) classes.  

For added flame-bait and thread fodder I'll add that there is a bikini 
contest &amp; an engine blow with the understanding that I'm condoning that 
sort of activity!  8-)
