&gt;DISCLAIMER:
&gt;As the US Mail screwed me on the last shipment, with about a 2% failure
&gt;rate, I must state that I cannot be held responsible for shirts lost in
&gt;the mail. All orders are sent 1st class, multiple orders sent priority
&gt;mail, so they should be shipped properly. As a poor recent college
&gt;graduate, I cannot afford to cover Uncle Sam's screw-ups, and while I will be
&gt;really sorry, I can't do anything as far as a refund.
&gt;If you are really scared about that, for an additional $6.75, I can ship
&gt;it registered mail. Like I said, 1 loss out of 54 isn't bad, but it is
&gt;still inexcusable on their part. Anyway...

As one who didn't get his shirt in the last shipment, I think that you
should arrange an appointment with your postmaster (or postmistress) and
demand that they find the missing shirts.
