Subject: Re: 1987 Camper Center Swivel Seat

I don't have one, but I've seen 'em. Saw one for sale at Campbell-Nelson
Used Parts--they wanted $200 or so.

&gt;Camperites,
&gt;
&gt;I've looked at the 1987 Camper Supplement to the Vanagon Owner's Manual and
&gt;found a Center Swivel Seat pictured and described as optional.  Do any of you
&gt;Camper owners have this option on a USA Vanagon.  It mounts in the center
&gt;area of the van, seats 1 passenger, has two armrests and a lockable
&gt;compartment in the base.  I have personally never seen one of these and am
&gt;trying to determine if they exist on Vanagons made for the USA.  I think that
&gt;if it was available, it would just be on GL model Campers.
