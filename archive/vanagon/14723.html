Subject: '89 Westy Price - Reasonable??

My friend is talking with a dealer in the SF Bay area about a '89 Westy. 
The van has about 70K miles and is imaculate - Power steering, brakes, 
Air &lt;needs service - no cooling&gt;, automatic, but otherwise seems a very 
nice van. They are sticking with a price of $17.1K and are quoting a 
&quot;Blue Book&quot; of nearly $21.
What say you all - They have refused $16K saying they paid more &lt;doubt 
it, but maybe&gt;.

Thanks - Jack
