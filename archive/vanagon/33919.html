Ha!  I knew that would get your attention!

I fired up the air compressor this evening, walked away to let it fill up,
and about 20 seconds later it started emitting this horrendous clatter!
I ran back and shut it off, and it coasted to a stop.  I opened the 
cover, and the piston fell onto the ground!  

Further inspection showed that the small bolt that holds the top of the
piston on (strange design!) broke off, so on the next up-stroke it bound 
against the top of the chamber, cracking the rod.  That was the first part
of the noise - the second part was the rod self destructing while it 
continued to fly at like 3000 RPM or whatever it runs at!  Then once the
rod had cast off the remnants of the piston, it continued to beat itself
against the bottom of the cylinder bore. Horrible noise, in either case.

She (its broke, so its a &quot;she&quot; now) musta heard me arranging delivery of
my new compressor not 3 minutes before (the 5hp, 60gal 15cfm jobber)!

Well, I dug up the receipt, and its only 10 months old, so I would hope
its still under warranty.  Its a Devilbiss 3.5hp, 30G tank, 9CFM model.
(thats a 30G tank to use on my next shuttle mission :)

So it looks like any further bus work is stalled until I get this problem
resolved...
