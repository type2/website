&gt;&gt;My advice to anyone with an older bus is to check the hinge *before* it
&gt;&gt;breaks, because it will be much easier to fix if it isn't already broken.
&gt;&gt;I am still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it looks like
&gt;&gt;drilling it out and running a bolt through the hinge is my best option,
&gt;&gt;without actually removing the entire hinge.
&gt;
&gt;I bought four new hinges for my '73 PickUp, they cost the equivalent
&gt;of 25 to 30 US dollar each _at_ the dealer.

It's also nice to have a friend that works in a machine shop and can do it
for you for free.. :)  One of my hinges was broke and the other one was
going the same direction.. Had em drilled out, and new stainless steel pins
lathed out for me..
