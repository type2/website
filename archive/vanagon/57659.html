Subject: Re: Good Dealers Exist!

&gt;Both my local dealer - with whom I have had a full 2 year relationship with -
&gt;and this distant dealer that I am working with are good people who are willing
&gt;to work WITH me on meeting my needs. But it is a 2 WAY RESPONSIBILITY when
&gt;you are buying anything.

I am a very careful consumer and endorse the steps you took leading up to
the purchase of your '91 Westy.  However, buyer beware is a sad commentary
on the state of consumer/vendor relationships.

Not everyone has the benefit of having previously owned 2 vehicles of the
same type, having a trusted expert to examine the vehicle, having 2 years to
build a relationship with a vendor or having the foresight to list such
explicit conditions of sale.

Yes, good dealers exist but some dealers do suck.  Let's continue to bad
mouth and boycott vendors and suppliers who deal less than fairly with
consumers and let us support and promote those who are fair, reasonable and
stand behind their products, even if they aren't explicitly bound to do so.
Consumers will always do better if they work together.

P.S. Kenyon, That is a great list you posted.
