Greg,

&quot;bum steer&quot;

I don't think it was a bum steer; no need to apologize.  The AC is in the 
general area (back of the engine) of the water pump and is always 
intimidating ... at least for me.  I was just trying to re-assure Tonya 
that the AC was not really going to be a problem this time.

Speaking of apologies, sorry that I misspelled you name on the last post.

Have a nice day,
Mike
