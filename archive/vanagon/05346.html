Subject: Aux. heater questions.


??  Does anybody know where the exhaust pipe of the heater is supposed to go
    to?  My pipe was missing when I bought the Bus ('82 Vanagon).  Should it
    go all the way back past the engine, or does it go off to the side of the
    car?

Ya see, when I turn on the auxiliary heater-- which is of the gasoline powered
variety, mounted in line with the heater pipes from the heat exchangers --
I get a lot of smoke in the cabin.  I took the whole thing appart yesterday,
and there don't seem to be any leaks in the combustion chamber, so the only
thing I can think of is that the exhaust from the heater is ending up in the
wrong place and somehow getting sucked into the cabin.  Any ideas, anyone?
I want to be warm this winter.

Thanks,

Albrecht
