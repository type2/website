Subject: Does everyones bus roll away?

My van has a bad habit of occasionally rolling away when I go inside 
for dinner or WHY.  I wonder if this is a 'common' thing, or an 
anomaly.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Sometimes the e-brake 
works well, other times it feels like I am hitting the end of travel 
on the handle and the brake isn't fully engaged.
