Subject: RE: My Westy diesel needs an engine..YIPPEEEE!


&gt;This gives me the excuse to repower with a gas burner...just the reason I
&gt;bought the van in the first place! Now, I could stuff a V-6 in the back,
&gt;but I am hearing loong tales of woe about that one. (sorry Steve, I feel
&gt;for you, but I just couldn't resist)


No complaints, Tom, I am indeed having problems with the V6anagon. Turns
out it's not the V6 engine or the adapter, despite my early STRONG
suspicions in that direction. Current prime suspect is a worn transmission
input shaft-- the (new) pilot bearing sits pretty loosely on it. Stay
tuned.

Odd vibration characteristics of the Chevy 2.8L V6 engine, still make
me scratch my head.
