Subject: '56 Controls

Howdy Volks'

Just bought a '56 Standard Microbus a few weeks back.  After a few days of
cleaning she is now ready to drive. But first, I would really like to find
out a few things about the controls (which are different than my '67)  On
either side of the heater control knob are two identical pull knob controls,
choke type.  The one the drivers side is, ironically, the choke.  What is the
other one?  Is it the reserve control for the fuel tank?  The bus had a gas
heater at one time so it might go to that.  I dunno.  If it is not the
reserve switch, where is it.  It's a '56 so there is no gas guage.  I really
don't want to run out of gas without knowing where the reserve is.

Thanks,
