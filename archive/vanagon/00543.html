Subject: interchangeability of ignition cylinders (key)

Re: No keys for bus:

A locksmith can handle that. Locksmiths have this widget that they plug into
the cylinder where they can basically &quot;dial-a-key&quot;, at which point they can
then make a key for that cylinder. I don't know the details because I've never
had to have it done... but it IS possible.
