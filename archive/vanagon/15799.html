Subject: Here's a creampuff for you jaded folks...

As seen in a local Auto Shopper type rag....

1967 VW Campmobile, White, one owner, 51,455 miles mint condition. Phone 605-348-7353 or days 605 348-1177

I called the guy tonight, and get this story (are you sitting down with your drool cups in hand?) The original owner was this guys uncle who recently died at 80 something. The old guy and his wife bought it to go camping in, as they had no kids and lots of free time. Included in the story was the fact that the old guy only drove it on clear summer days, and would open the engine compartment and wipe off the engine with his handkerchief when he was done driving it. 

Supposedly there are seatcovers put on the vehicle when brand new, and they are still on it... there are a few minor rock chips, and from what I can tell from the photo, a side step by the cargo doors, and a spare tire on the front. Of course it has the small popup section.

$5000 firm. I called out of curiousity, and found the current owner is the nephew who inherited it, and he and his brother are selling it to split the proceeds. It is located in Rapid City South Dakota. Good luck, and you had better move FAST on this pup! (Just think, a splitty with 12Volts-- and it is CORRECT!!! )
