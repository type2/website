Subject: Have Factory Training VHS Tapes 

OK everybody, here are the killer factory training VHS 
videos I hinted at a few weeks ago. I obtained most of 
this stuff by whining, sneaking around regional VW 
headquarters after-hours, acting kind of official in my 
behavior, and generally degrading my usually honorable 
self. 

I would generally plot for months as to how to obtain each
one of the segments. Then I put them all together on just two 
tapes.

This is the stuff VW made to train its top mechanics 
in how to fix Vanagons. Since the mechanics were 
obviously asleep during the screenings (if your 
experience at the dealers is anything like mine), 
you need to watch these yourself.

Mostly we're talking about late model Vanagon here.

There are two tapes and here are their contents (the
first number is minutes, then the description of each 
segment):

I am charging a fee for lending these tapes out to you guys, 
but I am not doing this for money as I have better things to do. 
But I feel it is my obligation to support everybody in their Vanagonness
and spread the knowledge around.

To get these tapes in the mail from me, send me e-mail with 
your snail mailing address. Send the e-mail to derekdrew_at_aol_dot_com.
Alternatively, save me time and a stamp by sending me a SASE 
(1 stamp; envelope for 8-1/2 x 11paper) to Derek Drew, 487 
Columbus Ave. #3R, New York, NY 10024.

Onward Vanagons!
