I think you can trade with just about any pre-Vanagon gas tank. They're
pretty easy to come by, but you probably will still have to get it worked
on. Mine had a cracked weld where the neck goes into the tank, and it was
also very rusty. I took it to a radiator shop, had them weld and gusset the
neck, and got it cleaned and sealed. It cost $125 but it was worth every
penny.
