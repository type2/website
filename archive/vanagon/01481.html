Subject: Re: westy H2O-tank key?

&gt;
&gt;I have an '81 westy with no key to the water tank.  Does anyone
&gt;know if these keys are all the same or where I can get one?  I've
&gt;tried 3 dealers with no success.  If they ARE the same, is
&gt;anyone willing to make me a copy?
&gt;
When my parents owned the van, their key broke off in the lock.  A locksmith
had no trouble making a new key, but I have no idea if they were able to get
the cap off first, or if they had to take the whole van in to the shop.
