I agree with Ken Winter.  Elevating the rear deck cushion to create a 
concealed storage space sounds appealing.

  This idea is consistant with Westy minimalist philosophy:  maximizing 
versitility and utility while minimizing weight and space commitment.  
Always elegant, never clumsy.

  Imagine some window cord sized line and four open eyelet &quot;quick lace&quot; 
loops, two on each side above the stock rear cushion height.  

  Use Instructions:  Lift rear door, attach cord to a rear loop, lace it 
forming a boxed X ending at the starting loop and tie.  Slide the cushion 
out and back in on top the boxed X.  Done.

  Total weight, probably under 6 ounces.  Commited space, both minimal 
and versitile.  You determine your concealed volume by deciding how high 
you intall your loops.  Too much lift would draw unwanted attention.  I 
think an 8&quot; lift, allowing conventional grocery sacks to fit on edge 
would work well, but it's your bus.  RV no-slip matting would arrest 
rattles.

  But four open eyelet loops projecting into the sleeping space is a 
design defect.  I've seen small resessed spring loaded handles on movable 
objects that would solve this objection.  But I don't know a source.  
Anyone know a source for suitable non-projecting cord attachment 
hardware?
