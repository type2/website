This trip report reminds me of a question that arose on my recent trip to 
the Canadian Rockies. Should you follow the same precautions camping in a 
Westfalia that you follow camping in a tent in bear country? In other 
words, should you be concerned about a bear ripping through the poptop 
canvas to get at the food in the van?
