Subject: I'm back?


I've been absent from this list for a couple of weeks because... I'm a 
new father!

Yikes! 

Margaret had a 9lb 1oz boy (Michael) last Tuesday morning. Both doing fine.

One of the gifts we recieved was a leather dog harness made by a good 
friend. He thought that Al the dog could pull a little cart with the kid 
in it. (Can you imagine that David Schwarze!). the harness is inscribed 
with our names and on the breast strap, under a brass badge, he inscribed 
the VW logo... just can't escape that damn company :)

To all that I've promise parts and literature  -  I'll get to it this week!


What kinda nonsense has this list been up to these last weeks!

Gas wars, electrical boners, and talk of splitting! I can only hope that 
last thread was started as a joke. It does seem to fit in with Derek 
&quot;Nostradamus&quot; Drew's predictions on the evolution of a list.
