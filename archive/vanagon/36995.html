&gt; Hey all,
&gt; While I was parts shopping at the local FL(foreign)APS today I asked the counter
&gt; guy if they carried the big chrome VW logo that goes on the front of the bus.
&gt; The guy said &quot;you're not gonna want it when I tell you.&quot;  It was
&gt; $78(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  I told him he was right.  Well, when i receive my WCM and
&gt; RMMW catalogs I will see if they carry them...


	Sean, West Coast Metric sells the chrome emblem for $57.75 (part 
211-601E) and the installation cups $3.90 (part 211-619). These were the 
prices in my 1995 glovebox edition. I don't work for WCM but I think 
their products are of good quality.
