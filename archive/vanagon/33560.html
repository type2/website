Subject: Re: 71:Timing:Carb: I can't get no satisfaction

Your puzzle intreges me.  I've had similar problems but I've figured them
out.  I jumped into your string late so if you could give me some
background on the bus and probelm it would help me troubleshoot.  Flat
spots are more likely to be a fuel delivery problem than timing.  Is the
flat spot always there?  Or does it go away after the engine is warm.  And
is it always off of idle or anytime you hit the accelerator? Have you
rebuilt your carb?  Is it stock and original or from unknown origin?

As for timing, the engine will work just fine timed statically.  You don't
need to time it a 3500 rpm to get it right.  Remember, the distributor
advances.  Of course it SHOULD also work setting it dynamically but in your
case it may not be.  John Muir has a whole section on static versus
dynamic.  It's worth reading.

I hope I can help you shed light on this.

&gt;James, thanks for the suggestion. I'm sure it's not the heat riser tube
&gt;(since I've had the engine off recently and checked), but your post did
&gt;make me think about exhaust. I'm not getting all the power I should;
&gt;maybe the exhaust is somehow clogged. That would partly explain the
&gt;releas of exhaust gases into the cab (not lots, but still not good).
&gt;
&gt;As for the timing, I can try adjusting per Muir, but it's my
&gt;understanding that the timing you need to be correct is the one at 3500
&gt;RPM, which is where the engine fries if you don't have it right.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe

&gt;&gt; If the '71 is a single carb then I might have a possible answer to the flat
&gt;&gt; spot problem.  The heat riser tubes that channel heat from the exhaust up
&gt;&gt; along the intake manifold (to preheat the gas/o2 mix) may be plugged up.
&gt;&gt; They can get filled with carbon from the exhaust and once that happens you
&gt;&gt; will get that awful, annoying flat spot.  You can try to unplug it but
&gt;&gt; you'll probably have to replace the whole manifold.  And...by the way...
&gt;&gt; this can happen over night, without warning.  You can test it by removing
&gt;&gt; the manifold and blowing into it. If air dosen't flow freely, it's plugged.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Another possibilty is the way you're trying to time the engine.  Try timing
&gt;&gt; it statically via Lord John Muir's book.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good Luck,
&gt;&gt; James
