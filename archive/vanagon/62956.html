Subject: Re: Which Subaru engine?


Subaru put a 6 cylinder in some of their XT's, and called it the XT6.  My 
mom drives an '89 XT6, with nearly 200,000 miles on it.  The engine purrs 
like a cat on valium, and I believe all it has needed is a valve cover 
gasket.  It is as strong as the day I drove it off the lot new for her.  I 
told her to change the oil monthly, send me the bills, and when she 
decides to get an Outback, I'll yank the six and drop it into my '87 
Syncro GL, if such a thing is possible.  

I'm not interested in going 100 mph with six of my friends in the Van, 
but I'd like to be able to get up all but the steepest of hills on the 
highway without downshifting.  And it would be nice to not lie awake at 
night worrying that tomorrow might bring a head gasket leak, intermittent 
engine cut-out, sticky lifter, high idle...

&gt; For what it is worth, I also thing the legacy engine would make a better
&gt; choice.  Correct me if I am wrong but did the 6 cylinder come only in the
&gt; SVX?  If so you will have to consider the avaliability and cost of the
&gt; engine and replacement parts.  Not to mention, the strain on the drive 
&gt; train, you will also need a brake system upgrade to stop the
&gt; shoe box when you are doing 100+ with 7 people, while pulling the trailer
&gt; and the A/C blasting. Also subaru no longer produces the SUX?

&gt; &gt; How about the six cylinder Subaru?  Would it be too much power?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which Subaru engine(s) is(are) a suitable replacement for the 1.9l VW?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I saw an ad for a Subaru 1800 4WD asking just GB#50 that 50 pounds for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engine. Should I buy this as an insurance policy?

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lionel,
&gt; &gt; &gt; The 2.2L Legacy engine is a much better candidate- more power, more
&gt; &gt; &gt; efficient, more modern. Available in turbo version.
