Subject: '90 Vanagon Needs Mechanic in Chicago
Date: Wed, 6 Aug 1997 15:19:45 -0500

I had a good non dealer guy until last month when he shut down.  Anybody
have anyone they are happy with on the North Side of Chicago?  Also how
about a body shop?   I am not looking for the cheapest ones just
somebody honest who knows Vanagons.

Also my A/C wasn't working and a freon recharge didn't work, so I took
it to an A/C shop.
Diagnosis bad expansion valve.  Cost approximately $600 including 3lbs
of freon and new evaporator drier. About 5 hrs labor for the expansion
valve (one dealer said it was a 7 hr job).  How close was this to being
in the ballpark?
