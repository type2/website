&gt; Last time I was at the farm to check up on the resting 
&gt; beast I noticed a small pool of oil forming on the 
&gt; ground on the drivers side of the engine near the front
&gt; (front is front).  This pool only forms with the engine
&gt; running.  The suspect:  Blown oil cooler seal.
&gt; Now, how much would a new oil cooler run me?  Gasket set?

Dave Carment and I priced new coolers here in San Diego recently.
They were $120.  The seals are cheap, if not included.

&gt; I presume that the engine must be removed in order to 
&gt; perform this service.  Correct?  ('74 II)  

Nope, it can be done easily with the engine in the bus.  Just
remove the fan housing and it is right in front of ya.

&gt; 						Btw, I get
&gt; the impression that the engine has to come out for any
&gt; and every kind of service.  I'm surprised that we don't
&gt; have to drop it when we change the oil...  Sigh...  

Baloney.  I once went as far as putting new pistons and liners on
my bus without removing the engine.  This is not to say that it
wouldn't be easier to drop the engine though, if you have the
facilities.  I didn't at the time.  BTW, I had to grind a tiny bit
on the transmission case to get one of the wrist pins out.

&gt; 							I'm
&gt; also wondering if dropping the engine can be done by one
&gt; guy (no gender specificity).  --Ralf (gutteral 'R')

Yes, no problem if you have a large floor jack and some patience.
