     Hello all you volksy types, I'm quite new to this list and to E-mail 
     in general so this all exciting stuff.
     What I wanted to ask you all is this: my good friend Paul has a Super 
     Bug and has been searching high and low for a list that is the 
     equivalent of this one but for Beetles. Can anyone help?
     
     I am chugging around Sunny UK in a 76 Camper this summer. Cheers.
