Subject:       Oil for a T4

I have always used a 15-50 in my bus but it is becomming hard to find 
and rather expensive.  the other day at Meijers I found 20-50 for a 
rather reasonable price. Can anyone tell me the difference between the 
two or reccommend a better, more available oil?
thanks.
Ed.
