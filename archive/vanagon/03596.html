Subject: Replace a sunroof ('72)

Hi all.

I have a '72 bus with the large sunroof (about midships). One of the
cables on said sunroof has broken and now the roof opens not 8(.

I am about to do a fixit thing on the cable, but (pausing thoughtfully)
am wondering if anyone makes an after market replacement. What I am
looking for is one that is made of dark plastic, pop-up type. Maybe in
a metal frame that just drops into the existing hole (water tight).

Any ideas, suggestions?

Thanks in advance!
