So Rich Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; My '87 Vanagon has blown 5, yes 5 different coolant hoses since last Labor
&gt; Day. I have spewed coolant (the good stuff) all over the state of Indiana.
&gt; Is it just me? Is it the fact that the van is now 8 years old and they all
&gt; need to be replaced. Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and replace
&gt; the rest (might have to get a 2nd mortgage on the house)? Are you guys
&gt; running in to this?

Well... do you want to pay for towing charges on top of the cost of the
replacement coolant hoses too?  If your losing different hoses, then I'd
say yes, replace them all.  That way your dealing with the hoses on your
own terms.   How many miles was the odometer at when this started happening?
