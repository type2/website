Subject: Heater exchange eliminators?

 Hi all. The heater boxes on my 1700cc Bus engine are rusted out, and
I can't afford to replace them until the winter, so I'd like to remove them.
 I am constantly seeing ads for pipes to eliminate the boxes for the upright
(type I) engines, but never for my (type IV) style. Does anyone sell these?
 Thanks.
Dan
