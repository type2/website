Martino,

First of all...
Learn to use your editor.  What you've done there is claimed that Ric
flamed himself by starting on a line with a &gt; to signify inclusion of
the previous message.
If Ric had written that sentence, I beleive he would have punctuated it 
properly (he, unlike you, is educated).

Now, hopefully, you will be able to understand this and in the future
you may even be able to feign intelligence when posting.


Secondly...

That flame is both:
			Over done elsewhere (alt.tasteless etc.)

and			Not appreciated here.  We're a group of
			friends not idiots.



Thirdly, and lastly...

It should have read...  (and notice the commas)

The best part of you, Ric, is the left hemisphere of your cerebrum.
You sure must not be in your right mind to drive with the engine in 
the wrong end.


Cheers

My Mother always said life was like a box of chocolates...
Your only going to like about one tenth of it.
