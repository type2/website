Subject: Re: #1 firing position on 009? (2.0 l FI)

  

though many things have been said about distributors,  I drove around in a 73
pop top Westy with a 77 fuel injected engine that came  (to me)  with a 009
distributor,  and I was happy with it for years.    I have heard someone tell
me it was wrong for the motor (after I sold the car),  but I had no
complaints with  that.    I had plenty of power, even cruising over the
Kiskiyoos I never had to shift down.

Yes always adjust valves at regular 3000 mile intervals, but  switching plugs
wires would not neccessitate adjusting valves.   But don't switch plugs
wires.   Put the new distributor in the same way the old one was.  Voila!
