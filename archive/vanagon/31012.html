Subject: V6 Transplant (WAS Surprising Syncro Sighting Part 2)

     Patrick Egan was showing me around his Crewcab Vanagon yesterday,
     and I can see that these definitely have added transplant potential.

     For those of you, like me, that had not examine these vehicles,
     the pickup truck bed is about four inches above the engine
     compartment. From the bed, you open a roughly 2x2 opening (orginally a
     wood lid, but Patrick's is very cool diamond plate aluminum). Then,
     down about four inches deeper, you are staring at the top of the
     engine compartment, with the stock rectangular opening.

     The potential of using this free four inches of space for a taller
     engine was obvious, and I'll just bet that is how the California
     Syncro Crewcab was done.

     (Another nice thing about the Crewcab is the entire back panel drops
     down for engine access from the rear. None of that stupid licence
     plate stuff.)
