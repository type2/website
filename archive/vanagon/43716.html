Subject: Chassis motor number

Every time I keep looking around my bus for the chassis number, I can not
find it! Am I blind or something? The only thing I could find vin-number
plates are on the right verticle of motor cover, right side of air cooler,
and right side of front passager seat. Am I overcoming something?
