&gt;My O2 sensor on my 87'Wolfburg seems &quot;stuck&quot;  I tried removing it with my
&gt;O2 sensor socket and a 3/8rachet but the darn thing won't bulge at all!
&gt;Anyone has any killer ideas?  Taking off the cat will be a real pain, I
&gt;hope isn't the only way.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone wanna take a crack at this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

Use a 7/8&quot; wrench.  If that won't work use a 7/8&quot; 6point deepwell impact socket with a
long 1/2&quot; breaker bar.
