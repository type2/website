Subject: Vac lines on a 79 Westie?

Oh boy....

A friend came over last night and decided he wanted to detail his engine before the
local VW show this Sunday... Sure, I said... knock yourself out... Stuff's over there
by the fridge...I come back a few minutes later and said friend has ripped all the injector
wiring and vacuum lines out of the way so he can paint the throttle body a nice mint green
(sm ;-))   Hmmmm, I thinks... wonder if'n he thunk to lable stuff...Naw, he say's...figure
you'd know'd it all.....

Jeeez...


What's the collective wisdom on the vacuum lines on a ACL type 79 liter? Got the wiring
back in place, but none of my reference stuff shows hose routing....

help folks.....


Kevin
