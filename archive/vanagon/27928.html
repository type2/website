Subject: 3/4&quot; Socket Set: Help

Would someone who received the original post (with the name and
address/phone number of the seller) about the 3/4&quot; socket set offer please
send me a copy?

As a newcomer to the list, I havn't yet become proficient at fishing in the
archive. However, being such a wealth of knowledge, it's inevitable. Until
then, I'd appreciate help in taking advantage of the socket set deal...

Thanks,
Dave
