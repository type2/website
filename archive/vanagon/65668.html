Subject:      Philly area parade (final)

OK everybody in the Philly area! Here's the final details of the Lansdale=

parade/show.

Sunday Sept 21, 1997 - meet at the Montgomery Commons Shopping Plaza
(this is not the Montgomery Mall).  The Plaza is located on Rt 63 just =
east
of Lansdale (between N. Wales Road and Rt 202).  Meet at 11:00 am.  I =
will
be there a little earlier and pop my top so you can find me easily.

Around 12:00 noon we will move as a group to the parade staging area
just up Rt 63 at the Penn Jr. High (Penn &amp; Church St).  As this is a firs=
t come,
first serve parade the only way we can parade as a group of VW's is
to arrive as a group, hence the pre-meeting.  The parade starts heading
down Main St. at 12:30 pm to the Olean Tile Works on N. Cannon St.
Once there everybody parks for this eccletic (sp?) car show.

There are refreshment vendors , demonstartions, activities.  No registrat=
ion
or entry fees.  I have seen everything from Mark IV Jaguars to tricked =
out
T-Birds, hot rods, classics, antiques, motorcycles, anybody is welcome.

For our purposes lets try to keep it anything VW related.

If you feel the need to call offical people Lansdale Parks&amp;Rec  215 368 =
1691
or 1 800 333 4550 (Gladys Ditzler - organizer?)  Call these numbers if =
raining
for confirmation of Sept 28 raindate if inclement (sp?) weather.

Come one ! come all !   Lets see what you've got!!!  Great fun!

If you need more hand holding, e-mail me privately.  If everyone who
e-mailed shows up we'll have an excellent turn-out!
