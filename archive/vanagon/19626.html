Not good, if you don't have the second battery.  I think I remember
looking at Sami's 75 Westfalia at Busses By the Arch and noticing that
it *did* have a built-in battery charger.  I bet it goes with the
auxiliary battery.

&gt; 											If it doesn't work that way is
&gt; there any way I can get it to? 

Only if you install a battery charger yourself, or coerce a friend into
doing it for you.  :)

&gt; 								  For some reason I have minor nightmares
&gt; about camping in some remote location, using battery for various things
&gt; and discovering that I don't have enough juice to get started again. 

You're not the only one.  The only way to rid yourself of those
nightmares is to get a second battery installed, and reserve the first
battery *only* for starting the van.
