Subject: RE: 12v dropping resistors

&gt;&gt; To drop 12v to 6v with merely a resistor will require a specific
&gt;&gt; resistor based upon the amperage draw of the device (or entire
&gt;&gt; circuit) you intend to supply 6v for. One resistor can't apply to
&gt;&gt; all loads/circuits/devices!   the mathematics to calculate this
&gt;&gt; resistor value are simple but i can't remember them!!
&gt;&gt; 

&gt;The same as the resistance thru the wiper motor,  Six is half of twelve.

Not true, as the voltage drop across the motor when it is running is due to the
sum of the resistive drop (IR or copper losses) and the Counter Electromotive
Force (CEMF).  The CEMF is a voltage that is generated across the motor leads
in opposition to the applied voltage that is proportional to the speed of the
motor.  The CEMF is what determines the maximum speed for a motor under a given
load.  The current flow through the motor is what determines its load carrying
capacity.  The load of the wipers requires a certain current flow to operate,
this determines the IR loss.

What all this means is that the proper method of determining the correct sizing
of a series is to either do it with a rheostat like was mentioned earlier, or
measure the voltage and current through the motor when running it off a 6V
battery and calculate the &quot;effective&quot; resistance of the motor using 'Ohm's
Law'.  That is R=E/I.  The minimum power rating for the reistor is E*I=P.  

I still say, go to the junk yard and scrounge up a twelve volt motor and make
it work.
