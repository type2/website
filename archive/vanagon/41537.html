Subject:  RE: Help! Fridge won't start on propane...  -Reply

i have an '84 westy...
i find that making sure the van is fairly level makes a big difference.
(if the front is higher than the back, it is really hard to start)

there is also a mod in the bently manual, i think you take the air pump
out, drill out something, and the pump pumps more air...
