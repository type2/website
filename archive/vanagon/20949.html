Subject: Head Temperature gauge wiring sensitive?

Well, I'm still in the process of wiring up the gauges on my 80 Van. What a
pain. First the oil pressure sender wouldn't fit into the hole in the tin
that
the old warning light sender left. Luckily my Dremel Moto-Tool was handy to
grind all that metal (just the tin) away.

The head temp gauge sender was fun too - I'm not
really happy with putting it on the spark plug, because it increases the
pressure one must use to put the plug on. I can only hope that I didn't
strip
the threads! (I'm pretty sure I didn't but it was hard to tell!)

Now I find that the wiring kit that came with the head temp gauge is about
10 ft too short for my choice of routing. (Frankly I'd be surprised if it
would work with any choice of routing in a bus/van!) Any idea *how*
sensitive this thing
is to the length of wire? the instructions mention not shortening the wire, but
nothing about lengthening it! I'm assuming that the increase in resistance
will simply cause the readings to be subject to a simple translation  -
I'll try to
measure it once I finish hooking up the other wires. Just wondered if anyone had
already done so.
