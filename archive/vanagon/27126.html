&gt; But OH NO.  Mr Station wagon, AS I AM CHANGING LANES cuts to the

    People tend to drive maniacally here in San Diego, and 
     inexplicably tailgate at all times. I'm about as patient
     as the next person, but there have been a few times when
     I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
     bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
     them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
     their shorts in fear of running into me.


     I'm in the market for a bumper sticker advising tailgaters that
     tailgating will not make my car go any faster...

     I can't decide if this is immature driving on my part
     or a good-natured effort to improve the driving habits
     of others...


A friend of mine had an old red Ford pickup and was tired of people on his
ass on hwy 9 and other windy mountain roads in Santa Cruz county.  What he
did was back the thing up into a sturdy stump a couple times and paste on a
&quot;Ibrake for tailgaters&quot; bumper sticker.  Never had a problem again...
