Subject:      Re: Yes, another but different tire question

&gt; Here's a test of tire knowledge. If my '86 Westy calls for the COLD tire
&gt; pressure for 185/70-14 tires to be 48 rear/39 front, then what should
&gt; the pressure be for 195/75-14?
Denys,
This is an interesting question. I can't answer-sorry. However I would
ask you specifically -what- called for those tire pressures. Is this a
placard on the door jamb, in the camper manual etc.? I am curious to
know, and would throw out this question to the list:
What is the concensus on Vanagon Westy tire pressures front and rear, at
least a loaded-condition ball park?. The 185R-14 Michelins on mine call
for max load at 35 psi. Can I go considerably higher:-safely-. With my
little diesel, tire hardness sure makes her roll a lot easier,(kept at
35psi f/r) but I don't want a blow-out.
I don't have any data on tire pressures for my Westy short of what is
tatooed on the tires themselves. Can someone expand (pressurize) my mind
on this point?
