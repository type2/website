Subject:      Re: throttle bodies - older motor with 85 tb??

the two switches are an earlier version ... as of engine number DH033353,
approximately mid-production for the 1985 model year, the two switches
were combined into a single switch.

the wiring diagram shows that the two switches are in parallel ... that is,
EITHER completes the circuit (and signals the computer). the full-throttle
switch (the lower of the two) is piggy-backed off the terminals on the
idle/deceleration switch (the uppermost of the two).

one wire (brown/yellow) goes to a ground connection on the left cylinder head.
the other (white) goes to connection pin #4 on the computer/control-unit.

hope that helps. :)
