Subject: Re: need BUS badge


Who all like to have European badges?

I'm just visiting several German junk yards to find the BUS
logo for an US listmember. Any other who like to have a used
or new emblem should e-mail me. I will collect the items and
ship it in one envelope to US, that will reduce to shipping
costs. But hurry up, I need some parts for my camper and have
to visit the salvage yards soon.
