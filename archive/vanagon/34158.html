&gt;My A/C compressor on my 85 Westy (water cooled) is starting to sound pretty
&gt;bad.  (Yes, I test it periodically during the winter months).  When I had
the
&gt;system checked last fall, the mechanic told me the compressor was dying.  I
&gt;just did a rebuild on the engine so I am mechanically inclined.  What is
&gt;involved in rebuilding the A/C compressor?  I curious as to how it compares
&gt;to an engine rebuild, costs involved, etc...

Problem is finding the parts.  Some special tools are needed for seal
instalation.  Need to find cause of failure.  Compresors only go bad for the
following reasons,   Lack of oil, or oil not able to circulate due to system
blockage.  Check receiver/dryer.  Run with out sufficient charge,  or
overcharged.  Radiator fan not working properly.  Liquid refrigerant getting
into suction side of compressor.  These compressors should be able to outlast
the vehicle.  Especially since they are rarely used due to insufficient
horsepower and lousy performance.
