Subject: re:But it's rusty

The story about Dean Aukes getting Opie hit and the woman complaining reminds
me of another incident similar to that.  My brother owned a Subaru that was
relatively old(I know it is not a VW, and he still hasn't reformed) and
extremely rusty, but it ran well, and he had just bought it a few days before
for $200.  He came out of a 7-11 or similar to find that someone had just
sideswiped it, and was just getting out of the car that caused the damage.
My brother informed him that this was his car, and he wanted the guys
insurance info so he could get the dent fixed.  The looked at him and said
the car was a pile of rust, and it was soooo old.
My brother told him that he had just bought it, so it was still new to him.
The guy then pulled out his wallet and gave him $200 to fix the damage, rather
than report it to the insurance. My brother was happy because that is what
he paid for the car.

It's a shame that no one has any respect for older cars, unless it is a
corvette, or something similar.

Oh well,

Cheers,

David
