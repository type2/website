Subject: Bleeding a dry coolant system


I'm in the stage to fill up the coolant system from
complete dryness. Because the van is still jacked up
on axle stands I can not raise the front. Also I
guess I will keep a lot of bubbles in the engine and
heater area. I have filled about half of the
capacity. What should I do with the rest, pushing
it under pressure into the cooling system (bleeding
screw opened)? Or is this waste of time and I should
wait until the engine runs to push the bubbles to the
radiator?

All suggestions are welcome
