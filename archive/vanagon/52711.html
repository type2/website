Gorilla?


hmm...i have one on my dash...name is Gonga...sucks his thumbs and all! 
then there is the monkey hanging from the poptop handle, the large bear 
that rides on what ever seat he feels like at the moment, a Dicken (cross 
between a duck and a chicken, best we can figure..) that rides in a small 
hammock hanging right under th cot int he poptop opening, and a normal 
size bear that usually sits by the spare tire, and stares out at the cars 
that are forced to slow down...looking right over my &quot;Fear This&quot; sticker 
on the rear window...(as in, I'm bigger, and slower. Get outta my damn way!)

oh! wait...you meant....oops..:)
