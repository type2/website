Subject: the lure of the Syncro

I've got a lead on an '87 syncro w/113K westy (base camper - fridge, 
poptop).  (I haven't seen this yet.....was this configuration produced?)

First, how much does the syncro add to the selling price of these typically?
(I knnow that this is kind of a ridiculous question, but I just haven't 
seen any syncro westies that weren't full campers)

Second, how do you test whether or not the syncro works properly?  

I've readd enough to know the rest of the deal, but I've generally 
ignored the syncro posts except those that mention how much tranny 
problems cost.  Actually, for those who know, is there a typical tranny 
repair that syncro owners encounter at some point analagous to the head  
gasket problem?  

If it's in good shape (and I've been told that there's a complete set of 
repair records), then it may sell fast.  So, any replies that y'all can 
make today would be appreciated.

Thanks  for the help.

david
