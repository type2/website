&lt;&lt; On another unrelated, but VW note:  I received my rear window seal that I
 ordered from RMMW when it was on sale for $9.95.  That was a great price,
 but did I mention that I ordered it in February?  That just broke my
 personal record for longest backorder!  Oh well, at least it finally
arrived. &gt;&gt;
Very interesting, considering we just shipped over 100 of these seals to RMMW
about 3 weeks ago, because RMMW's normal supplier (Brazil) has had them on
B/O for them since last November.  Guess RMMW got tired of waiting too. (And
they paid a little more than $9.95 too!).  We're now RMMW's main supplier for
these and a few other Window Seals they've inquired about from us.  It's a
lot softer than WCM's IMHO and easier to install as well.  I've been making
these since 1976 (The Old Volks Home).  Made in USA - the only way to go :)
