  &gt; PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T SPLIT THE LIST!!!

I agree wwith Ric.  Even though I'm a waterleaker, I'd hate to lose, say, Bob 
Hoover's missives, or the exploits of Rusty vanBondo, or all the other 
air-cooled things that make this list great.

If it's split, I'll just have to subscribe to both halves.
