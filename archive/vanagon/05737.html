&gt; 
&gt; Ok here is the situation, I found a guy witha 79 camper.  He wants $3200 
&gt; for it.  Here is a general description of it.

	Hi! - I've been reading the list religiously since I bought my
        Westfalia about 5 months ago...Here's my first .02 cents:

	$3200 seems like a bit high although potentially reasonable.
	I bought my 84 GL Wolfsberg Edtn. (sp?) (cracked windshield but 
	otherwise in good condition) for $3500...Here are some more
	details: 

		1. 98000 miles
		2. Blaupunkt amp and speakers (12 in all)
		3. Canvas in good shape (a few 1/4 cm holes)
		4. Fridge and  Stove working ok
		5. Sink pump needs to be replaced
		6. Automatic Trans 
		7. Quite clean - no rust
	
	Although it seemed a bit expensive when I bought it (in Ga)
	I now believe it was a good deal. Actually I'm not all too 
	concerned about $$ in hindsight - I've been very, very happy 
	with it so far - Westy's are great all around vehicles IMHO. 
	
	Recommendation: Buy it, but bargain some if you can...
	
	Also...(and a bit unrelated to above)

	With Bently manual in hand (plus Muir's &quot;How To Keep Your 
        Volkswagen Alive&quot;) I performed my first mechanical feat over 
  	the weekend...Replaced my front disk brake pads...trivial it 
	may be to most - but life altering for me.  Perhaps even a 
	religious event...!

	I have this question though: Although the brakes were making
	some remarkable noise before the pad change, it seems not to have
	gone away after the change.  Is this normal? - Is there a spray I
	can use safely and effectively?

	Help would be appreciated...
