Wanted to add my experience to the don't-be-intimidated-by-fuel-injection
stories:

A few years ago my '78 Westy was acting up.  It ran fine most of the time
but every now and then there was a very sudden and very brief loss of
power.  Kind of a lurching feeling as power was lost and then almost
instantly regained.  I too suffer from the 'oh mi god not the fuel
injection' syndrome and it was getting worse and worse to the point where
it would do this every few minutes as my knuckles tightened and my
stomache churned. So during the 4 hour drive from Mount Rainier
(in Washington) where I was working at the time to Bellingham, WA to visit
friends (now I live there) I pulled over in a campgound to take a look.

I spend a few hours going through all of the basics of ignition just to be
sure (spark, timing, dwell, etc.) all looks good.  And then I start
through the fuel injection checks in Bently with ohm-meter in hand.
Nothing too definite here, until... wait - doesn't that big plug to the
intake air sensor seem a bit loose??  That's all it was. The plug was
jiggling around and aparently occasionally losing contact in one or
more of its connectors. Problem solved.

Cheers, Tim Burnett

p.s. A mechanic once advised me to always check the systems grounds on the
bolt boss in between cylinders 3 &amp; 4.  I've also found that the plugs to
the double relay (on the firewall on the left side) can get loose, too.
