&gt; &gt;	3.	Replacing the louvered (sic) windows in a 79(or earlier) 
&gt; &gt;Westy with solid or sliding glass windows from an early 80's Vanagon 
&gt; &gt;based Westy? 
   The sliding window thing is not possible, from Vanagons at least,
the window is much smaller, '79 Buses came with the exact same style
sliding windows though occasionally, as I have a set I bought out of
one to put in my '71 Westy.  They take the same seal as a side window
without vent window, which is another good swap, but try to replace
the louvered windows seals first.  A company used to sell the sliders
for Buses as a conversion in the late '80's as well as a lot of rubber
products for bay windows but they went out of business.
