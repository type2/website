	Geez, *GUYS*. SOOOO possessive! Or are you thinking of
all the maintenance items that might strand your S.O. in NoFunsVille
that would just be more adventure to us hardcore types? 

	The last time the fuel pump relay failed in my 77 Rabbit, I
was on the way to watch an F1 race on ESPN. The engine died and
I didn't hear the fuel pump running, so I knew exactly what to do.
The first time it happened, I assembled an emergency wiring harnes
with a fuse and a big toggle switch and long leads (soldered) to
plug into the fuse pannel. I carried this doggle in the car
for when the fuel pump relay or the relay pannel would fail.

	I pulled it all out of the spares box/tool-kit, tie-wrapped 
the aluminum bar with the switch and fuse holder on it to the steering 
column and kept going. Total delay, about 3 minutes. There's NO WAY
my late wife would have reacted that way, though just a jumper
wire with a fuse would have made sense to her. Natch, she got the
new car when we bought one.

	Couples where both are car-heads are rare and wonderful things.
I know one such. :)

	Cheers!

	Bill
