Subject: Unexpected trip part I

Volks,

When I got the call that my gramother had passed 
away, I knew that there was no way we could
afford to have me fly to Syracuse New York from 
Memphis Tennessee for the funeral.  I was
bumming heavilly untill the obvious became 
visible.  I would drive my 71 Westy, Olga.

Crazy?  Yes, but I had tried to take good care 
of her, and I had enough spare parts to fix most
any problem that I encountered on the almost 
2200 mile round trip.  As for a place to sleep, 
well, I would sleep in the camper!!

So last tuesday I informed my employer that I 
would be taking thursday, friday and monday off
for the trip to New York.  I worked feverishly 
on tuesday and wednesday getting Olga packed,
and making sure everything worked as well as can 
be expected. My trip home from work
wednesday revealed a new squeak, so upon my 
arrival I got the front up in the air to 
discover the disk brakes shot.  Working until 
about 10:00 PM, I got everything together and 
double checked my spare parts just in case... My 
spare parts list included: spark plugs, ignition 
coil, rotor, distributor cap, fuel pump, belt, 
voltage regulator, battery, tire, oil, transaxle 
lube (with thoughts of Grendal), two jacks, 
wheel chocks, fix-a-flat, tire puncture sealer, 
timing light, dwell/tach meter, starting fluid, 
wheel bearing grease, disk brake pads, spray 
lube, and of course duct tape.

Being unsure how Olgas heat would hold up in the 
cold north, I packed two sleeping bags, a wool
blanket, thermal coveralls and everything else I 
expected to need in the event of the winter
weather that appeared to be approaching the 
area.

I started off at 4:00am on thursday under a 
cloudy sky.  I was able to maintain 65 mph 
despite the full load in the bus (including a 
port-a-poty just in case).  My only complaint 
was the cool breeze blowing from the back into 
my right shoulder.  During one rest stop, I 
decided to try and put one of my sleeping bags 
in the open area under the camper top, and much 
to my delight I found it stopped the draft!!!  
So, I set out to look for a building supply 
store where  I would purchase a sheet of rigid 
foam insulation and install it in the offending 
space.

I couldn't help but notice the wind blowing in 
the area of 30mph around Cincinnati, but wasn't 
too concerened until I attempted to carry the 
sheet of foam across the parking lot of the HQ 
in which I had bought it.  It started to break 
on a couple of occasions, but I managed to get 
it to the bus, only to discover my true problem 
would be how to hold it, cut it, and install it 
without the remaining piece blowing away!!!  I 
wont go into detail, lets just say that 
somewhere over Cincinnati there is a piece of 
silver covered insulation blowing free with the 
breeze.....  I did keep the majority of the 
insulation, cut and fitted a piece to the 
opening in the roof, and completely ended the 
draft!!!YAY!!!

So, I set out once again.

I found that I was beginning to get a little 
road weary around Columbus OH, so I decided to 
look for a campground.  I was looking forward to 
the first night in the bus..  I found a place 
about 15 minutes south of Columbus, and stopped. 
 They had electrical hook-ups (for my space 
heater) but no bathroom facilities... Boy was I 
glad I brought the portable toilet!!  I 
surrendered my $12.00 and chose a site.

Stay tuned for part II tomorrow...
