 I am looking at an '87 Vanagon GL to buy.  Everything seems great except the
 following:
 
 Idles low (to me) about 700-800 RPM.  After 5 minutes of hgwy driving the
oil
 light came on when it was at idle (with the AC on).  I have had several
 Jettas and 70% of them have had problems with oil pressure sending system.
  Ie problem with the pressure sender not the pressure.  Is this a common
 problem with Vanagons or is there really a problem with the oil pressure in
 this one??
  &gt;&gt;
Low idle speed and wrong viscosity oil can both cause this problem.  Find out
what oil is being used (should be 20-50 or synthetic equal) and have oil
pressure checked with a gauge.  Typical healthy engine should hold about 10
psi per 100 rpm up to the relief valve setting, (engine warm).
