Subject: &lt;'86 Vanagon sighting [F]

As I was watching X-Files tonight, who should 
make an appearance than Dr. I. Wannabe (a Kevorkian
copy), helping some convalescent home resident w/
a suicide in a pre-86 Vanagon.

This stereotype is getting old; I think Hollywood
should move onto Chrysler products for assisted
suicides, as there's probably more common ground
there...  ;-)
