Subject: Re: Adventurewagen and Transawn 2000

&gt;I have a 10ft awning manufactured by A&amp;E, a subsidiary of Dometic, it's tidy,
&gt;fits with three rain gutter adapters, and is fairly strong.  A&amp;E used to 
&gt;manufacture a more basic model the Transawn 2000, mine is the Catalina 2500.

Actually, I have the transawn, uh, 3000, I think. 

Anyway, the model I have is very beautiful and I have painted it the same
color as the van, which I have determined is just the thing to do with any
awning. 

The Transawn that I got was said to be the easiest to  put up and down that
Dometic ever sold (I can do it 1 handed) but for some reason they
discontinued this model.
