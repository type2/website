Ed,
Thanks for the reply.  I must have just missed that one. When I was there
they had a Vanagon out front minus engine. They said they sold it for $550.
I think the odometer read 200,000.  I bought an engine core from a 1983
Vanagon they had.  They said when they got it, it ran but sounded like it
was running on three cylinders.

I have it dismantled and am attempting a rebuild.  Where would you buy new
gaskets, bearings, etc?

Thanks,

Scott Maurer
