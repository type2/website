It sounds like the solenoid is bad.  I would recommend just purchasing a 
quality rebuild.  Except for Syncro's, a starter is easy to change on a 
Vanagon.  Should only take about an hour.  Don't for get to disconnect the 
battery for safety.

My 85 westy starter is on its way out. It starts with a little coaxing,
ie. a hammer. It is hard to turn the key and tap the starter at the
same time not to mention lyingg on the ground every morning is begining to
lose it novelty. I read in Bently that it can be rebuilt. Has anyone
rebuilt startes or is it better off to find a newer one and install it. I
would like to rebuild and  install it myself if it can be done fairly
easily.

Thanks

Mike
