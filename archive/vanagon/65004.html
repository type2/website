Listees,

  I have a person working on a set of Discs for the front of an 86 and
newer Vanagon( Spindles are different) to be able to install a MUCH
larger set of rotors.

  As far as year disc I don't know I'll run that by him:)

  The Larger discs are being &quot;created&quot; for the 2.0 Longstroke engine
install that will be offered before the end of the year!!!!!!!!

  Kyle
