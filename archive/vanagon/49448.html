Subject: Re: vanagon sliding door han

Gary Nichols asked about replacement sliding door handles.  



Been there, done that, spent the $$$.

I decided to replace the handle before the sag allowed the free end of the
handle to gouge the door.

Price sound's about right - exhorbitant!  But it does come with a new lock
cylinder and key -- which of course is a seperate and different key than will
fit the existing locks.  Unfortunately the replacement part appears to be a
twin of the original.  On the other hand, my original lasted about 13 years,
so there is hompe for similar longevity of the replacement.  When I ordered
the handle, I ordered a few small plastic washer type pieces at the same time 
referenced from the dealer's fisch diagram.

However --  If you remove the old handle and turn it over and look on the
bottom side of the main barrel, you should find a very small patch of some
kind of paint that you can scrape off to uncover a small threaded hole, about
1/16&quot; in dia.  Put the key in the lock cylinder, use a jewler's flat bladed
screwdriver to probe down the hole, locate and engage the slotted headless
screw and remove it.  If you then turn the key and simultaneously pull, you
can withdraw the entire lock cylinder assembly.  To the same to the new haldle
and swap the cylinder/key assemblies, reinstall the screw with a drop of
locktite on the threads and you should be in business again.
