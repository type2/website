Subject:       Re: Heavy-duty, rear, permanent, rack question 

&gt; allows access to the rear hatch. I am toying with doing such a thing for
&gt; my '67, but wonder if it would be safely possible to attach such a burly
&gt; thing to her tender rear. Anyway, if anyone has any thoughts on this, I
&gt; would be curious...

I'm sure its possible, but I can hear her screaming.  Don't do it!  
Please!

I'd suggest a roof rack:

Pros:

Definatly the coolest accessory for a bus.
Will hold spare and gas, and small house. 
Much easier to install.  Probably around the same cost. (Couple 
hunert bucks)
No holes in her skin.

Cons:

Where's the ladder honey, we're out of gas!
Wind resistance.  Actually... considering the bus' own resistance.

Just my thoughts...  probably biased by my own desire for a roof 
rack, and the pain I experience when seeing splitties with 
attachments on the body (ie. scoops, ext oil cooler, etc.)
