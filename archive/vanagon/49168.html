Subject: '76 Westi in Holland

Hi there,

I am writing this note just to let you know I joined the list. I own 
a '76 Westfalia camper (120.000 km, 75000 miles, only a 1600cc) that I 
acquired from the first owner just two month ago. 

I live in Holland (the tiny country just west of Germany). It is my 3rd 
bus but I am not a real auto DIY fanatic. I am amazed at all the techie 
stuff (welding heads, fixing Porsche engines etc) I read of people on the list.

I work in the software field and visit Ca (Sacramento area) once or 
twice every year. I've seen several messages from people in that 
area so drop me a note. We may be able to meet someday.

I live about 30 min drive from Germany and also speak the language. 
Any help needed with German, send me a note. One of my customers is 
an automotive publisher. They have an archive that goes back to 
around 1900. I may be able to draw on them on occasions.

My address details are:
     Jan ('John') W. Brier
     email: j.w.brier_at_briscon.nl
     tel  : +31 (318) 518 778 fax +31 (318) 526 274
Best regards,

Jan W. Brier
