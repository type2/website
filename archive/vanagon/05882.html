&gt; &gt; I think we in Canada deserve to be broken down by province. How about it.
&gt; &gt; I'm sure most will be in BC, but we're a hard-living, cold driving folk.
&gt; &gt; C'mon joel, please?

&gt; Yeah, Joel!  PLEEEEZE???  I'd like to see, too.  (But in B.C., we're 
&gt; laid-back, snow-boardin', RAIN drivin' folk!)

We debated this once before but nothing was done. Now is the time! Sieze
the motor! (I mean moment!). (I am willing to bet that next to TO and
Vancouver, Ottawa has a pretty good representation on the list). A
breakdown by province would be very helpful for all involved. DC-
an Ontarian and proud of it.
