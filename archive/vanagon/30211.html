Speaking of Westphalia and Holidays.  Each time I make the drive home to 
see my parents in Newburgh, IN  I pass through Westphalia, IN (didn't 
see any campers or busses though).  I took  pictures, which I'll upload 
to a web page when I get them developed.

[During the same visit] I went jogging one morning through an adjoining 
neighborhood and passed a house with a large wooden sign in the front yard 
that said 'Possum Crossing.'  Uh Joel... any relatives in Indiana?
