Subject: Re: Diesel Westy Glow Plug LED

The sensor is on the flange that is pointed to the front of the van, it has
the small heater hose connected to it. The temp sensor on the upper
radiator hose flange on the side of the head is for the temperature gauge.
They are both the same if you want to switch them to test it. The relay
goes into full glow when resistance is high, disconnected is very high
resistance and full glow should be in the area of 30 seconds. The relay
like to get very corroded in the location it's in so pull it out and look
at the terminals. Good luck.

&gt;temperature sensor which tells the LED to go out??

&gt;We haven't heard anything out here in the west coast about the election. 
&gt;What's happening with the exit polls?
