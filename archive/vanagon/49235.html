Subject: Clicking Noise

Hello all:

Started the &quot;Road Hoopty&quot; up this morning (84 VW Vanagon with 110K on it),
and heard clicking noises. Went round the back and confirmed that it was
mechanical in nautre and not a loose fitting in the exhaust. It seems to be
coming from the left side of the engine. So, could it be valves, or push
rods? Would taking a rubber mallet to it help? Any help would be great.

thanks


Matt
