&gt; A dim memory.. reading of a Tatra, a Czech car.  Aircooled by an induction 
&gt; system.  The cylinders were shrouded with tin with an exit nozzle on one 
&gt; side, inlet on other.  The exhaust was blown out the centre of the cooling 
&gt; nozzle tin and created a venturi effect that sucked air past the cylinders.  
&gt; Supposedly noisy, wonder why?  Tim Smith
&gt; 
&gt; 
Speaking of Eastern European cars, how about the Trabant?  A
two-cylinder, two-stroke cycle air cooled engine.  No oil changes, just
mix some oil in with the gas when you fill it up.  No fuel pump, the gas
tank sits right on top of the engine and gravity supplies the fuel.
Interesting :)
