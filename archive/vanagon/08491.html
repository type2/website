&gt; 
&gt; don't know about Mexico ... but if they do have &quot;Transporter&quot; badges, wouldn't
&gt; they fit only the older breadloaf buses? they don't make Vanagon bodies down
&gt; there.
&gt; 
  
  There is a water-cooled Mexican breadloaf (with Mexican license plates too)
  that I've seen several times in Palo Alto. It has a black badge that reads
  &quot;CARAVELLE&quot; on the rear hatch.
