&gt; 1.) This bus has some rusted-thru areas just below the windshield. 
&gt; I've seen this on many 68-71 buses-- it seems to be a common problem.
&gt; Normally, body shops fix this by cutting out the rusted metal, and
&gt; either welding in new metal, or fiberglassing. But this section helps
&gt; mount the windshield. Can these things still be done? Anyone have any
&gt; experience in this area? Any other suggestions for fixing this?

Yep, they all do that, the 68-71 worse than the post 71 though
I never have figured why, the airbox was redesigned but that really
shouldn't matter.  Either solution will work fine, if the rust is real
bad try to have it done in metal, If after pulling the winshield and
cleaning up with a wire brush on a grinder or a sanblaster and its
only fairly pitted with small holes, fiberglass is a good solution, I
caution from some body work experience, fiberglass sticks best only to
clean, acid etched bare metal, do less and youll do it again.  Even done
like this H20 will come from behind and eventually cause problems. It is
fairly critical to maintain the origional contours for good weatherstip
sealing and after you finish, paint the frame and let dry a good while
before reinstalling the glass.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.) The big sliding door on the side, runs on two (three?) bearings.
&gt; These are very stiff and difficult on this bus, and probably haven't
&gt; been lubed in years. How do I lube these, and with what? Also, if they
&gt; need to be replaced, where can I get (new) parts? Any special techniques
&gt; for removal/replacement/adjustment?
&gt;

Three, or four sort of, one on the little arm at the top, two on the
little arm on the bottom and one in the middle under the track cover
below the rear window.  Clean out all the tracks with a degreaser, a
cheap quality paint prep degreaser or a product called VARSOL works
nicely.  You might remove the little castings the bearings are attached
on the bottom while somehow supporting the door to clean the bottom
track and the bearings well. Grease liberally with a molybenedum (sp?)
based grease, commonly available at auto parts stores for about $2.00
for a 14ox tube or tub.  Typically called Moly EP, looks like cv joint
grease and smells the same way, rated for extreme pressure and water
insoluable, good stuff, could even be used in cv's in a pinch.  Note
that with your other rust problem chances are the lower track may be
rusted and need some attention or the door will never work correctly.
I have never seen any of these bearings wear out to the point they wont
work, including on some well worn 200,000+ mile parts Buses, more likely
the tracks are full of hardened lithium grease filled with sand grime,
etc.  Adjustment is a matter of common sense, look how it fits closed
and move the appropriate bracket to compensate, shims are stacked
between the door frame and lower bracket to affect the height in the
frame, if the door is low when closed, the rollers might have worn to
the point another shim is required.
 
&gt; 7.) Has anyone ever mounted a Type-4 engine (1800cc or bigger) in a 68-71
&gt; bus? These years have the rear engine mount, which requires either the
&gt; &quot;busmount&quot; engine case, or an aftermarket adapter plate that goes over
&gt; the oil pump, for type-1 style (upright fan) engines. Any suggestions or
&gt; tales of experience, either good or bad?

Probably not worth the effort, cheaper to build a good high performance
Type I anyway.
