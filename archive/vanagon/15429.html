What was the result of the discussion on Stainless Steel valves?  Yea? Nea?

A buddy of mine is building a desert race motor and was telling me he
was gonna put em in (we were looking for started DP heads today at the
junkyard)

I mentioned I'd heard some stuff about them, but couldn't recall exactly
what the consensus was.  I think I remember them being OK for race motors
that get torn apart alot but not for street motors.  He doesn't tear
his motors apart unless he has to, but he does drive them hard.
