Subject: Re: 71 bus...floorpans


I have a catalog from Mill Supply in Cleveland, OH, that shows front and 
rear floor sections for '50 - '67 Busses and rear floor sections for '68 
- '79 Busses.  They may have front floor sections by now (they also have 
most other repair sections, including structural members and some Vanagon 
pieces).  Their phone number is 1-800-888-5072, the snail mail address is:

   Mill Supply, Inc.
   3241 Superior Ave.
   Cleveland, OH  44114-4344

Good luck :)
