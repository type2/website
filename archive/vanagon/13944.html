I'd second this; I learnt the hard way and had to remove my engine
three times before I sussed out that the 70 release bearing and
the later pressure plate don't work together (having been assured
there would be now problem). 

I went a strange route and had the ring from the 70 pressure
plate fitted to the later one and thus retained the original
release bearing. It has been fine for over two years, but with
hindsight I would change the release bearing.

Good luck
