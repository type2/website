Subject: Tires again

I have one tire that's gotten damaged by running it at low pressure.  
Found out too late.
All the tires on the van ('84 GL) are BF Goodrich LT 195/75 R14 M+S, and 
not the 185 R14 C7 PR that are called for.
Now for my questions:
  Would anyone recommend replacing the one damaged tire?
  If I replace two, should I put on 185/75 or get what's on there
  Lastly, should I put the new ones on the front or back?

Thanks for your advice!
