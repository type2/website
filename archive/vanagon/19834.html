Subject: '66 kombi problems (longish, sorry)

          the week after the blue ridge rally (where &quot;horst&quot; performed
          beautifully) i was heading to the tampa area and something
          let go in the motor (1600 sp).  it was towed to shop of
          choice for diagnosis.  they said broken con-rod and they
          wanted $2000 to put in a rebuilt from sunny cal.  nope says
          i, paid them 1/2 hour labor and had it towed to my house.
          tonight i finally have time to begin.  hopefully motor will
          be out and sitting on the bench in my shop where i'll tear
          into it on the weekend.  i've never done this with a
          4-wheeled vehicle but have built harleys, indians, bmws, and
          moto guzzis (motorcycles with equally dinosaur technology as
          a vw) so i figure this shouldn't be a great problem.  might
          have to get some bigger spring compressors, etc.  might get
          a hernia carrying the motor up the four stairs to my shop.
          might have to wait longer for parts to arrive from whereevr.
          anyway, i'll certainly ask some dumb questions from time to
          time.  1st one is: are there any good reasons to keep the
          1600 single port configuration?  i have access to a dual
          port motor for super cheap.  should i consider switching
          heads?  i bought this vehicle 45k ago and have been very
          happy with it.  i have no idea how many miles before me or
          how it was treated.  body is very rough but we're working on
          it.  1/2 of those 45k have been in the smokies and 1/2 in
          hot but flat florida and that's the way it'll continue.
          we've been able to cruise a steady 65mph in the flat parts
          with no overheating or knocking.  my inclination is to
          rebuild this very motor but i'm open to suggestions.  thanks
