Martha Rubin askes:

&gt; John et al - many of us in the Bay Area prefer the Morro Bay option,
&gt; since it's a lot closer, but the southern CA site was selected
&gt; out of the possibility that people from AZ and NM would also attend.
&gt; Can we PLEEEEEZE hear from those people - whether they would
&gt; come to Red Rock?

Well, I'm still interested.  I definately won't go if it moves to
Morro Bay.  I'd like to make it if held at Red Rocks although I can't
say for absolutely certain at this point.  Some stuff that I have
to include in the equation right now are:

1. Janice has a kidney infection right now which is putting
   her behind with her school work.
2. Prospector ('72) seems to be leaking more oil out the back than
   usual.  (oil cooler? yarg)
3. Georg ('73) is on the road again and just passed emmisions with
   flying colors so we could bring him. (needs tie rod ends though)
4. Red Rocks is *still* around 600 miles for me...

So, I would have to say that my likelyhood of coming to Red Rocks
would be around 70% at this point.  Sorry, that's the best I can
predict at this point.  (I really *want* to come!)

Cheers,

 -Dyer
