&gt;He was wondering if it was possible to get a vanagon with nine seats. 
&gt;I think not in the US market, but what about Europe or Canada?

I believe they offered both 7 and 9 seater Vanagons in the USA in 1980 and
1981 and discontinued the 9 seaters after that.  They may have been offered
as late as 1982, but I don't think so.
