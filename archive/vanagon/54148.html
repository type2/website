Subject: Hoover Sermons Change Pulpits...


The Sermons of Bob Hoover have a new home. They are now located at:

http://www.primenet_dot_com/~bighouse

Please note that this location is temporary; they'll be moving all over
again in the near future, but Mr. Kurtz needed them moved out and there was
nothing else for it. I know it's inconvenient but we'd be grateful if those
of you who have links to the Sermons would keep track of this.

Up to now the Sermons have been graciously and capably archived by Richard
Kurtz &lt;rkurtz_at_bellsouth_dot_net&gt;, who has been responsible for maintaining what
is in my opinion the most phenomenal resource on the net. We owe him and
Bob Hoover a lot.

I'd appreciate it if somebody would post this to vintagevw.
