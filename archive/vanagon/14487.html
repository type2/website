&quot;mantis&quot; (would that be decesed(sic) as in dead, or as in contagious?) sez:

&gt;my life has been the van on the A team and I think that is a vw bus..

Uh, not quite; the A team van I saw was some sort of GM truck product.(?)  
Unless you were around for Back to the Future or Magnum PI, you wouldn't
have seen too many Type 2s, and they sure weren't EuroVans...

&gt;(blah, blah)... 5 cylinders right?, just like the
&gt;later vanagons... so power is probably equal..

YIKES!  I'd like to have Steven Johnson jump up and tell us his '91 Westy
has 5 cylinders!  While the EV does have 5 cyls, the only N. American Vanagons
with more than 4 cyls that I know of have Porsche flat sixes stuffed in 'em,
and they sure didn't leave Hannover that way...
The &quot;feel&quot; of power (or lack thereof), however, does feel approximately
equal in the bus/vanagon/ev due to the increased weight of the EV.

hmm...  vt_dot_edu...  what is that?  Virgin. Tech?  what exactly is a &quot;Hokie&quot;?

Now, back to your regularly scheduled madness...

ps-my apologies if some other EV driver has already fired off a salvo; I'm
in digest mode and this is as good as it gets.  :-)
