Subject: RE: Rain-x

        Tried it for awhile and did not like what it did to my field of 
        view.  Streaks were a problem as was the water beading caused by 
        the world's slowest wipers.  It did &quot;gunk&quot; up till it wore off 
        which took about a month.  It just did not work for me.
