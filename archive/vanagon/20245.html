Subject: 71?-79 headrests for sale

i recently obtained a few of the headrests that fit the front seats on a
71?-79 bus. they would also fit the rear seats on kombi's w/ headrest tobes
in them (ever wonder what those black plastic plugs are covering on the top
of your seat?)

any body interested in them? i am charging $20/headrest (canadian) shipping
not included. they are in good shape (not rips/tears) . There is minor rust
on the metal tubes that actually fit into the seat frames,  but you'll
never see it once they are installed. fwiw the local ripoff/scamartists
wrecking yard hayman's (could you concur more s.stones??) charge
$75.00/pair for headrests!

e-mail me privately if interested.

michael
