Subject: Right Plug? also, #3, lightly toasted...


Doin' the ol' tuneup this afternoon, I checked my compression for the 
first time in a while;

#1= 135		#2= 130		#3= 107		#4= 135

I assume #3 is toast. How bad would you say this is? How soon does it 
need attention? all plugs have white deposits, so I'm gonna assume its 
running too lean...

da stats: '71 Bus, stock 1600, replacement carb (just in), all parts 
generally new. has about 20,000 miles :-(

ALSO*****
When I got back from the parts store, I noticed that they gave me 
Champion RL-87-YC plugs. Is this right? I thought is was L-88-A.
Anybody know what these will do in terms of heat range? 

Thanks
