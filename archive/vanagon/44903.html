Subject: A short Query

Hi peoples....

Just thought I'd ask if anyone in Oregon or Washington knows Steve Clark.  He is 
the PO of our '81 Westy (Edward), and I thought that it would be cool to tell 
him that Edward is fine, and that we're happy with him.  He displayed a certain 
tenderness upon parting with his pal, so I thought that he might like to hear 
this.....
