Quoting  Eugene Palmer ( eugp_at_uclink3.berkley):

&gt;&gt;After reading Jim Busboy's account of the low pressure oil cooler idea, I
decided I liked it, and drilled and tapped two holes in the deep sump so
this will be possible in the future.  I brazed the deep sump pick-up tube
on, and managed to get it square, even though the factory tube was way
crooked.&lt;&lt;
   -I didn't see this account, are you sure you weren't reading my post of
the 1/2&quot; pipes I braized to the sump plate in my 71 bus and ran thru an oil
cooler so it SUCKED the oil thru the (horizontal, under the bus) cooler and
filter before sending it to pump and bearings?  Must have worked, that bus
made it around the country that way (and another 50k MI; I used a temp.
gauge, don't remember what the readings were; around 230-250 I think,
dipstick sender.
