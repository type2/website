Subject: Why me?


Well, I am now looking for an engine.  Anyone got a long block 1600 DP? for 
sale?
It turns out that my motor with brand new heads ate a valve on #2.  I have 
no idea why this happened with 1042 miles on it.  I am however, bummed.  The 
only reason I can think this would happen at so few miles is that I got a 
defective head.  There is absolutely no way the valve was tight on #2 
exaust, I kept a log of what the clearance was at every adjustment.  
miles  old clearance
------------------------------
93      .006
172     .010
284     .009
548     found out that adjustment screws were getting worn
600     replaced screws and set all to .007
907     loose again- screws are wearing out _again_

Most of the internals are thrashed, including the new cam.  There is very 
little left of the piston, and the head of the valve came out the exaust.  I 
don't know if I'll be able to rebuild the engine with the extreme cost which 
will be involved.  

I know where there is a 68 bug with a AE motor from 1971 in it.  I was 
considering buying it and scrapping the body, it is in very bad shape.  I 
did a compression check on the motor, all were 115-120 PSI.  The only 
problem is the motor has no crossmember holes.  I know I heard some people 
talking about some adapter or some such thing, has anyone ever really used 
one of these things for a long period of time?
