&gt;     You must be talking about Manhattan Kansas.  Its only about 110 miles
&gt;from KC. Fort Leavenworth is north of Kansas City.  Seems like you were a
&gt;little lost on this trip.  :-)

&quot;lost&quot; ain't the word for it! :)  it was stupid to drive that long, but i
was in a hurry and my father was with me and he wouldn't shut up the whole
trip!!!! gack! anyway, it must be that Lawrence was the last sign i can
recall when i was lucid. :)

but at least i remember i was in Kansas. :)
