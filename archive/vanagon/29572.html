&gt;other head as well).  Is is it possible to skim the head (machine it?)?
&gt;BTW, in my opinion, the Bently manual really sucks!  Even simple tasks such
&gt;as draining the coolant are described in such a manner as to make them
&gt;completely uninteligible.  I have checked out the Vanagon Information site

Replacing the head is the normal way, used heads are available, try Parts
Place Auburn Hills Michigan.

I have never heard of just plain milling down the head.
Don't know why the corrosion pits can't be filled with TIG welding, then
milled. Perhaps take it to a GOOD machine shop, non-automotive alloy
fabricator types who do lots of aluminium work.

Desperate low budget fix: 

1) Wire brush/sand blast the heads and get the pits down to clean metal,
absolutely CLEAN, uniform silver gray with no crud. Maybe acid etch too.
2) Mix up JBWeld automotive epoxy (no other brand) and fill the pits, using
a good steel edge to get the surface flat/smooth.  No bubbles allowed.
3) Let cure 24hours, (oven cure?) then reinstall with new gasket.


This fix was done on my bus by the PO and a devious mechanic.  I was not
pleased when I found out about it.  However, it is still tight after about
16 months, and I regularly run it up into the warm/hot range, coolant fan
was broken for a while too, ran very hot.  It's also done two 750 mile
non-stops and several 400mile non-stops.  Seems fine, absolutely dry.  It
was a gusher before done apparently. If a new gasket and $7 worth of epoxy
buys 2 years driving ........ you figure!

Oh, and you'll get used to the Bentley, like you have a choice :)  Tim
