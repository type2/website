&gt;BTW who on the net has put a door light switch in the sliding door on a
&gt;84 and on Westie?

well, i've made a &quot;modification&quot; to mine ... if that counts. the switch was
already there, but i made it turn on/off a Westy light fixture right overhead
in the middle of the sliding door. so i can now turn on the light (or have it
turn on when the sliding door opens) and be able to see my toolbox (which is
bungied to the side of the middle two-setat).

the only thing i did to the light fixture was to add a back on it, to prevent
the light from going up onto the roof/headliner. the light is just another
courtesy front light fixture.

if you are getting ready to ask if you can do the add-a-switch, the answer is
yes. the B-pillar (between the front door and the sliding door) is hollow,
and is accessible from the overhead &quot;air duct&quot; ... where the air vents live
in the roof. that's also where some big wires (for the courtesy light and the
rear window defroster) live.

it takes a bit of &quot;fishing and snaking&quot; to get wires down into the B-pillar,
but it can be done.

good luck.
