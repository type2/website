Subject: Re: leaking vanagon

&gt;Greetings! Any Vanagonites (or otherwise) had experience with rainwater
&gt;leaking from behind dash?
&gt;After about 24 hours of driving rain, there were slow drips on both the
&gt;passenger and driver side (91 Vanagon) onto the floormats. I felt around as
&gt;best I could from below: very damp, unable to locate source. windshield seal
&gt;seems intact. Any ideas?

It IS the window seal, take out the glove box and pull off the airduct 
tubing and you can see right up to the  metal rim/panels under the seal.  
Betcha see some rusties there too.  Mine leaks on both sides, worst on 
passengers side. Pry the seal slightly by glass and body and goop with your 
favorite slime.  I use clear cause I can never do it neatly enough to avoid 
smearing black stuff all over.  Tim Smith
