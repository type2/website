Clay, this is what I have come to call the idiot factor (no offence 
intended).

The idiot factor arises when you do something which you ought not to 
do because you know better. It is not about doing things through 
ignorance, like me NOT undoing two crankcase nuts which I didn't know 
about, and couldn't see, and which are not well explained in Muir or 
Bentley, and cracking my case trying to split it. 

The idiot factor causes you to do such things as put your distributor 
rotor on 180 degrees out so your motor doesn't start 'til your mechanic 
drives out to your house to tell you. It also causes you to catch your 
accelarator cable between your engine and gearbox everytime you reinstall 
your engine, resulting in you having to undo the engine bolts to get it 
out. It causes you to connect the positive wire to the earth terminal on 
you new VDO temp guage so that the guage doesn't work until your mechanic 
checks it and tells you about it. It caused me to do a number of other 
idiotic things when I did my engine rebuild and causes me to do idiotic 
things regularly.

I suspect we all have to live with the idiot factor, some more than 
others. So far I've been lucky, it hasn't cost me too much money, just a 
bit of embarassment.

&gt; I spent a whole year driving slow 

I am lucky, I only spent a month driving slow but I know how you feel.
