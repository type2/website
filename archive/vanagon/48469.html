Subject: VW Jamboree

Well, i just got back froma rather lack luster Jamboree.  I guess it was
all right.  i was really disapointed to see a category for honda's and
toyota's with loud radios though.  they just don't fit int the &quot;VW
Jamboree&quot; billing.  anyway......

I had the opertunity to meet a few folks from the list.  We got to chat
and tqalk about VW's.  actually, i had a great time all day just talking
to people.  Since i was trying to sell my crew, that opened up alll kinds
of conversations.  In my opinion, that is the joy of going to a show.
getting to talk to folks about something that both love.  VW's.

the show was, as i said, ok.  not too many bus's.  maybe 20 - 25.  some
nice ones though.  5 crew cabs there.  A ton of bugs there though.  the
show attracts bugs with big motors and loud radio's.  not what i like,
but...  

The parts sections was, well small.  not much there.  i did get a perfect
front over-ridder for $10.  not much there. though.  maybe 20 guy's with
stuff.

The bikini contest, missed it.  

my truck did take !st in vintage type II class which was a suprise to me.
they did not have a vintage comertial class so i got throughn in with all
the deluxe's and others.  i was happy though.

 The truck did not sell, but i got some offers.  anybody know what a
&quot;gucci&quot; motorcycle is????

I don't know if i will go back.  it is right next store to my house, but i
am not sure.  anybody else go???  what was your opinions?

Take care and God Bless
matt
