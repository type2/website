Subject: Re: 71 bus turn signals

&gt; Hello listmembers,
&gt;    Taking my son to school this a.m. Noticed when I changed lane car behind
&gt;me blew horn. My signal was on but clicked fast. Got home and  checked rear
&gt;bulb was out.
&gt;Replaced bulb and signal worked fine. Was wondering if signal supposed to
&gt;give you this  racing click when bulb is out or do I have some kind of
&gt;electrical problem. 

Hi!

The rapid clicking also could mean the contacts that the bulb push against
are dirty/corroded.  Replacing the bulb in this case might only solve the
problem temporarily since removing and inserting the bulb may have caused
you to make a good contact.  Make sure the old bulb is truly bad--if not,
then clean those contacts!
