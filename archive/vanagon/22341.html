&gt;.happens to me all the time on the freeway. don't even think about it much
&gt;anymore. crawl under the bus with a hammer and bang the solenoid a few
&gt;times. works like charm for me. scares the hell outta gas station
&gt;attendants though, the way i'm reaching for that 5 pound hammer when i pull
&gt;up...

&gt;
&gt;&gt; a friend with another '80 Vanagon asked me about the following problem and
&gt;&gt; I didn't know the answer:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; when he first bought the van a couple of years ago, he found that when it
&gt;&gt; got really hot it would not start. eventually a local vw garage told him
&gt;&gt; that this was common in older vans, that the starter was the culprit, that
&gt;&gt; once it was fixed it wouldn't happen again for years, and so they replaced
&gt;&gt; the starter for him.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; well, this year it's doing it again. symptom is that the lights dim when
he
&gt;&gt; engages the starter but there is no audible solenoid function, nor is
there
&gt;&gt; any starter motor spin. if he lets is set awhile and tries it again, it
&gt;&gt; works fine.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; any ideas? I'd be happy to relay them on to him!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; TIA

I have a '82 Diesel Vanagon and have had 3 starters in the 2 1/2 years I've
had it.  Actually, my 3rd starter is my second, rebuilt.  They always work
fine for a while, but eventually, sooner or later, I turn the key and nothing
happens.  I try again, and starts instantly.  My rebuilt one has even done it
a couple of times and its only two months old!  I'm starting to think
something besides the starter is at fault.  I think it happens most often on
very humid days (most of the Summer, here in Tidewater Virginia).
