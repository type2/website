bounced this off a power engineer here at work re: current limiting.
so for what it's worth...

&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems the correct way to hook up an aux
&gt;&gt;&gt;battery in our vans is to use a 'combiner' relay and not use an RV
&gt;&gt;&gt;'isolator'.  Fine.

&gt;Dwight, I'm not familiar with either of these.
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;But a problem remains when the aux battery is heavily discharged and
&gt;&gt;&gt;the vehicle is started.  The discharged battery can draw a very heavy
&gt;&gt;&gt;current load until battery voltage comes up.  Something in the order
&gt;&gt;&gt;of 30, 60, or even 100 amps.  This also has a disadvantage of
&gt;&gt;&gt;prodcuing gobs of H2 gas (acutally H2 and O2 in a exquisitely
&gt;&gt;&gt;explosive combination) if a conventional deep cycle battery is used.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Very heavy battery cables are the order of the day, in addition to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;sealed battery box.

&gt;
&gt;I would rather vent the H2.  H2 diffuses fast.  Best not to let it
&gt;accumulate.  The threshold for combustion/explosion is 4% minimum H2 in
&gt;air.  That explosion possibility continues up to about 80% maximum H2 in
&gt;air.
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn't there an electronic device that could limit the charging
&gt;&gt;&gt;current in the conductor going to the aux battery?
&gt;
&gt;This would be a switching &quot;buck&quot; or &quot;stepdown&quot; voltage regulator with two
&gt;stage current limit.  30 amp initial current limit, backing down to a 1 amp
&gt;&quot;trickle&quot; charge once the aux. battery ternminal voltage reaches 13.6 or
&gt;13.8 or so.
&gt;
&gt;I am not aware of an existing product on the market like this, but I
&gt;haven't needed one and never looked for one.  Do you want me to look for
&gt;one?  Probably at least $100. if it exists.  The one possible problem with
&gt;what I described is that coming off the alternator at about 14.5V doesn't
&gt;leave much &quot;voltage headroom&quot; for the switching buck regulator to operate
&gt;from.  The switching transistor duty cycle would probably go to 100%
&gt;initially, or maybe 99% to limit the current to 30 amps.
