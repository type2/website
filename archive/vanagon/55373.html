Subject: JB WELD HEADS?

I have an 86 westfalia, 102K with leaky heads(never overheated).  I am in the
process of repairing it. I would like to know who out there has tried
repairing heads with the JB Weld method and how long does this repair last?
TIA
                                     
                                                  Chris
