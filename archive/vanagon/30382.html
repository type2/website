&gt;If these questions have been recent threads, feel free to just email
&gt;me directly.  Any replies are greatly appreciated!

Actually, I think ALL of these have been recent threads.

In answer to your questions:

1)  Yes, Bentley seems to be oblique sometimes.

2)  Yes, if your rear heater core leaks, turn it off until
you can replace it.  If shutting it off solves the leaking
problem, then the core is bad, not hoses.  Prevailing
viewpoint is that repair of these is difficult but doable.

3)  Defroster vent cable...now what was that solution?

4)  Yes, vanagon parts are expensive and everyone has an
opinion on where to go for replacements.  Bus Boys has some
Vanagon parts too.  Some have been unhappy with Parts Place,
Inc.

5)  Driving in snow/ice with a Vanagon (2WD) is not a major
problem if you have good rubber, but remember your weight is
in the back when you turn or you fishtail big time.

6)  You should not need to block off your radiator on a trip
to Milwaukee unless it gets way below zero (F).

7)  The Old Bus Rescue Squad (northern Illinois chapter) is
here in DeKalb, Illinois if you need help in the area.  I
believe your Vanagon qualifies as old enough.

Any one else?
