Subject: Coolant hose needed.


Hi All,
	I am looking for the coolant hose that runs from the thermostat
housing over the transmission and down to the radiator pipe that runs the
length of the van.  If anyone has one sitting around or know where I could
get one besides the dealer, please let me know.  I've got one coming from
Camelback but it wont' get here until late next week, even overnighting it
the whole way.  

Cory
'86 Westfalia

P.S.  This is for a manual transmission van 86 or newer.
