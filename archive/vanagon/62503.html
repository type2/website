Subject: Re: Tech tip #2/torque values

&gt;Excuse my ignorance but what are the torque values for Vanagon lug nuts
&gt;(standard wheels) and why are they so crucial?  Thanks in advance for
&gt;educating a novice.

Bentley shows

	1980 to Nov. 1984	125 ft-lb
	from Nov. 1984		133 ft-lb

and doesn't seem to differentiate between synchro or 2wd.
