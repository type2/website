&gt;Joel: we can probably dispense with the &quot;CAN&quot; designation for the Canadian
&gt;provinces. I pity the bus whose owner doesn't know the short-form terms
&gt;for the provinces and territories.... But just in case some do not know, they
&gt;are: ALB

well ... the only problem with that is that my dipply little program keeps
track of 'foreign' countries with the - prefix ... and if i turn Alberta
into -ALB, what will i do when someone from Albania joins the list? :)

oh ... and we didn't 'lose' the swedish one ... he just turned out to only
work for a swedish company, but was really in the UK. :)

you know, this is almost getting to be real work ... i might actually have
to rewrite the program!!! horrors!!
