     &gt;&gt;The last time the fuel pump relay failed in my 77 Rabbit, I
&gt;&gt;was on the way to watch an F1 race on ESPN. The engine died and
&gt;&gt;I didn't hear the fuel pump running, so I knew exactly what to
&gt;&gt;do. The first time it happened, I assembled an emergency wiring
&gt;&gt;harnes with a fuse and a big toggle switch and long leads
&gt;&gt;(soldered) to plug into the fuse pannel. I carried this doggle in
&gt;&gt;the car
&gt;&gt;for when the fuel pump relay or the relay pannel would fail.

        Ahhh, yes, the dreaded fuel pump relay failure...
        I also had the same little jumper setup stored in the
        glovebax... I once gave one to a neighbor who was
        stranded in a similar situation...
