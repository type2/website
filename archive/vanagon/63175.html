Subject:      Power curves and torque curves for 2.1L

Does anyone know where I might find torque and power plots for the 2.1L
engine? And then the same for a 1.8 inline four (out of a Golf, Jetta etc
etc)? I found I regularly cruise at the same rpm ranges with the auto tranny
in my recently acquired older Golf and since the golf would be a striaght-
forward switch (provided I find the parts from a diesel), I think such a
switch would be a better option to my syncro as I wouldn't lose ground
clearance and could use the snorkel as the air intake routing would not be
much different)... Plus, the wiring harness and injectors are the same for
the two cars, I believe, just need to change the ECU and maybe the airbox...

I know some of the parts can be imported, but I don't know about the oil pan
or the dip stick (I believe this is different). I will have to look over
the Bentley for a few hundred more hours, but I wanted to check the torque
and power curves to figure out if such a switch is really a decent idea...

P.S. anyone know if lower ratio granny, and reverse gears or difficult
to come by? I want to put 215/75R15s and want to be able to go 5 mph in the
granny gear. I don't really know where to start looking for anything like
this...
