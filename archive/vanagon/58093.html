&gt; I have AN 84 GL (automatic).  For about a year I have struggled with a low
&gt; power/poor milage
&gt; problem.  Compression checks out on all cyl.  Power is good unti the engine
&gt; warms up.   After reaching operating temperature it is a dog and I get about
&gt; 16 miles to the gallen on the hwy.  I might think this is normal except for
&gt; the fact that I have an 83 that is identical except for the xmision (4spd
&gt; manual).  It seems to have plenty of power and averges from 22-24 miles per
&gt; gal.  I have swapped out every component in the fuel and ignition system
&gt; including fuel rails.  The only thing I haven't changed is the wiring harness
&gt; itself.  This includes different computer, ignition module, injectors,
&gt; flapper box and fuel regulator. I have also changed the temperature sensor #1
&gt; that is next to the temperature sender near water pump.
&gt; 
&gt; I also get the mysterious and famous occasional miss/ cut-out that occures
&gt; infrequently and is corrected by shutting the engine off and starting up
&gt; again.  I haven't purchased the reccomened harness that is suppose to fix
&gt; this but I don't think this is unrelated to the fuel consumption and power
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas would be appreciated?

I too have the same problem with my 84 Westy.  Got about 20mpg when I
first purchased it at 70k.  5k later I started noticing terrible mileage
(14-15mpg)  I searched the archives and I cannot get a clear picture
about this harness.  It seems that it is a fix for 86(85?)  and above. 
However, I exhibit the exact same symptoms as you do and what the
archives say, so I think I will track down a new harness.  What the hell
it just might work.. Good luck and I will let you know.
