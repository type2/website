&gt; I have a line on a 1978 bus with a 1974 SUPER BEETLE engine (???!!!). Does
&gt; this raise any hackles? Also the bus is possibly in need of some carb work. He
&gt; said that the bus floods and stalls at stops and that he had it fixed before
&gt; but it's starting to happen again. Anyone hear of this before?
&gt;
&gt;No but I've imagined putting a Type I engine in a 72-79 bus.  If you get a 
&gt;look at this unit, please see how they handled the engine tin to body seal?

	I have a 1974 super beetle (type 1 1600 dual port) in my 1973 bus
and it works fine.  I've never had any problems that i can associate with
the different engine (aside from a little pre-removal to ge tthe engine
out).  I kept the original shrouding and cut a piece of tin to fit the gap.
It screws to the engine shrouding and is rubber bumpered to the frame (and
it's about ready to be replaced because all the recent work has warped it
loose).  
	As for the carb.. if it's a bad problem it'd drop the money and get
a new one.  I've spent way too much time trying to fix one when it never
really comes out right.  Make Sure It's the Carb that is Faulty before you
do this....

backing problem without disconnecting his auto-choke.... for now&quot;
