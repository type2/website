Subject: '87 exaust story - finale !
Date: Fri, 24 Jun 1994 07:00:28 -0400 (EDT)

Yes, finale !  I got my '87 camper back on the road Wednesday night. 
After much running around and calls to RMR in Montreal.  Seems the pieces
that were to come from them were not really there when they were supposed
to be ????  Any way,  All the pieces finally got into my hands Wednesday
afternoon and after work I installen them.  Quite straight forward and all
the pieces ligned up and bolted together with amazing ease.  For those of
you who don't remember the original story, there is a multiude of pieces
to this exaust system.  I kept the original front manifold pipe and
catalyic converter, got a muffler and tail pipe from Canadian Tire, rear
manifold pipe, side pipe, manifold gaskets, and muffler support straps
from RMR, muffler to converter gasket and muffler to tail pipe gasket from
Bells Corners Auto Parts, side pipe dougnut gaskets from Speedy and last
but not least all new nuts and bolts from Ottawa Fastener --Whew !
I was inatially afraid that the myraid of parts would not line up and a
lot of prying and grumbling would be neccessary -- not so !  The manifold
pipe, side pipe and straps from RMR turned out to be ALTROM stuff - had 
ALTROM stickers on them anyway.  So these were the same pieces that others
were asking more than double the money for - go figure !  Profit my a*s,
thats outright thievery !  The side pipe has a small story all it's own. 
The original is attached to a cast iron right angle piece, which I kept in
the end, using a doughnut gasket at this end and a flat triangular gasket
atr the converter conection end.  RMR said originally he was sending a
side pipe that was made to eliminate the cast iron right angle piece, but
when the pipe arrived it was not so but it was still not as the original,
it connected to the converter with a doughnut gasket intead of the flat
gasket.  At first I thought this was not going to work but after close
inspection I realized the the converter is made to use either pipe and
their respective gasket - yea !  Oh, yes one other tidbit, the hanger for
the rear manifold pipe, that VW wanted $90 for and that nobody else had, I
had repaired for $5,  I cut off the old rusted clamp from the hanger and
had welded a normal U-type muffler clamp in place -- works just fine -- I
even painted it with high-heat, rust proof paint, which I did to the
converter and cast iron right angle piece also.  So, that's it, job done
and it's quite once more and the savings were HUGE !
