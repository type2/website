Subject: VW Parts availible to listmemebers. (was Bus Boys/Bus depot/??????????????

I've been sitting back and reading the Bus Boys/Jim Thompson/Rob Clay/Anylistmember 
who wanted to jump in ORDEAL.

  I find it strange that after so many of us have sent BB's $4.00 Or $5.00 OR whatever 
the Catalog cost is, and HAVE NOT received a catalog then WHY would you call and order 
PARTS from them?

  There are a few Honest and Fair people that are Easily Reachable via E-mail and will 
respond to your e-mail and even ship out your order ON TIME, or at least when they say 
they will!

  Granted I've not been around the &quot;List as long as Bus Boys, but I've been serving 
the people that contact me as fast and fair as possible.  I offer Deals frequently on 
Expensive parts, and I'm always looking to find that special deal to &quot;Pass On&quot; to the 
list or anyother lucky person in need of that part.

  I'm seeing Many post's about Ron NOT Responding as quick as you ALL think he should. 
 Well, doing this type of a business is NOT easy!  I work 40 Hours a week in the 
Repair shop,(Volks Cafe) I then add about 35-40 running the &quot;Volks-Motorsports&quot; 
Business.  Try that one on for size.  I'm not bragging, I letting the people that 
Don't Know that providing this type of a service can be tough at times.  Most people 
want the cheapest price on the best part availible to them.  I and a few others try 
our Damndest to do this for you.

  Ron is suffering from the early stages of creating a system that works for him in my 
opinon.  I used to be BURIED with e-mail and never making any forward movment to 
satisfy the &quot;Customer&quot;.  Sometimes the best thing to do is to point that customer in 
the direction that they'll get the peticular part they need, Instead of spending too 
much time and neglecting other peoples orders.  This is a fine line.  If I send you 
the direction that you'll find Exactly what you're looking for, Won't you check with 
me in the future the next time you have a need?  Usually a person will.

  I've been a bit slower than normal, I'm not sure if it's the UPS situation or that I 
Pissed somebody off? Either way I uncurage All people Looking for parts to check ALL 
their resources and see what the different people have to offer.

  I also don't post as much to the list as some of the other &quot;Vendors&quot; do due to the 
fact that in the past I was given a tough time.  I am almost afraid to post to the 
list sometimes because I'm worried that I'll piss somebody off and start something 
similar to the Bus Boys Ordeal.  I think WE have better things to post to the list.  

  The list and the Internet are 2 tools that we ALL have access to utilize.  I know 
that I can go anywere and the List is going to be there to help me, In the same aspect 
that I've been here for other listmembers while they were in my area.

  Anyone that needs parts that seems to NOT be finding what their looking for, e-mail 
me.  I have more resources than most and If I don't have it I probably know were to 
find it.

  Thanks for listening to my once every other month posting:)

  Kyle
