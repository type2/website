Subject: RE: female stuff on trips

	while we're on the subject of interiors and cooking, etc..  I was 
wondering if anybody out there has info on privacy curtains to go btwn 
the front and the back of the bus--just behind the front seats.  
currently i have a curtain strung across a stretched rope but i would 
like to have a curtain which draws across the arc of the roof so as to 
provide complete privacy.  since my '82 westy does not have any front 
curtains or the original westy info, i have not been able to duplicate 
the factory stuff.  any sugestions on this?
	also, regarding the cooking.  i have been living in mine for 
about 9 months and just two months ago was able to hook up to 
electricity--no computer though!  before with two of us and cooking most 
days and using the gas for the fridge, the propane would run out in 8 to 
9 days.  now running the fridge on electo, the propane has not yet run 
out and when i checked it a couple of weeks ago, it was more than half 
full.  how long do they usually last with just cooking?

	btw,  i have noticed quite a few subscribers are ncal. that is 
cool, i feel like i should be able to walk out side and see them on the 
street.  i live is santa cruz where there are thousands of vw's, esp the 
westies.  when my nieces come to visit, they usually count bugs on the 
road, but once over the hill they give up because it is overwelming.  an 
awsome site.
