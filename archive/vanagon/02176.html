&gt; &gt;Okay, its time I asked, what exactly is a &quot;dropped&quot; or &quot;sucked&quot;
&gt; &gt;valve? 

 While we're on the topic of identifying expensive problems, how do you tell
that you have a cracked cylinder head? ?Very low compression on the affected
cylinders?

 I have a dodgy head on my '71 westy- it has a helicoil that leaks slightly-
but the compression is fine at the moment. Am I correct in thinking that
if and when the head cracks I'll know because of low compression?

Cheers,
