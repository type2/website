Subject: '67 Westy resto update (98% burnt out)

Wood Interior Refab:
Just called Woodworker's Resource 5402 S. 40th Street, Phoenix, AZ and
confirmed that Baltic Birch is available in 5' x 5' x .125&quot; Estimated cost
is $25-30.00 US each and is special order with only a couple of days wait. I
would suggest calling your local &quot;Fine Woods/Woodworker's&quot; outlet near you.

Rekeying the Latches and Locks:
Got it done last week. Paid through the A** and of course heard of the
imfamous &quot;someone else who coulda done it cheaper&quot; after the deed was
completed. I went with the good chrome and said to heck with the EXACT
correct month on the part number. All work on one key. =)

Reinstalling the Locks and latches:
Have you ever had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of reinstalling the long slider bars in the
side cargo doors! Phew! what fun...

Insulation:
Pink Panther delight and spray glue. The lungs love me. Safety first... 
I bought a roll of R-25 and quickly found that it was much too thick. Split
it in half and it still looks plenty thick. If I used the whole thickness it
would have compressed too much to capture any dead air. I didn't go for the
sound deadening, foil covered carpet padding stuff. The intentions are to
install some kind of a moisture/vapor barrier. I think I will get by just
fine. Huh? Say what? I can't hear you...

Painting of overlooked items:
See the flame post!

Overall:
Slow progress and totally burnt on the project. Wish I never started the
thing... Grrrrr. In reality, we will enjoy it when completed but are 12
months out of love with the bus. Flakey vendors have been a 98% buzz kill
for my love of VWs.

Ellis needs an attitude adjustment...
