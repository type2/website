&gt;Thanks for the reality check! Sometimes (confession time!) I wonder what 
&gt;it would be like to own a new crysler minivan. Thanks for setting me 
&gt;straight.

Then again, there are always exceptions...my father wonders why I keep buying
VW's, when his Chrysler vans perform so well...he puts about 40k/year on 'em,
and has never had any problems...go figure...'Course, he buys a new one every
three years, so prolly never kept one long enough to have rust..(sigh)..ha
also sent me an e-mail the other night, wondering why the Eurovan hadn't made
the C&amp;D Car of the Year  (salt in the wound).  Guess I'll just have to keep
comparing bank statements!  ;)
