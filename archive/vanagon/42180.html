 &gt; BTW K-D tools make a good quality
 &gt; triple square as well, brobably a bit cheaper than that &quot;gold-plated&quot;
 &gt; Snap-On.
 
K-D is the brand I broke three of, before I got my SnapOn.  

K-D may work for some folks, if their vehicles weren't assembled by 
orang-utans.  I have quite a few K-D tools I am happy with but the 
triple-square driver is NOT one of them.
