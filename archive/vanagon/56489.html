Subject: Daytime Running Lights-91 Carat

I am looking for information on how to install the daytime running lights as 
shown in the Vanagon Bentley manual on pages 97.241-97.243. My local dealer 
couldn't find the relays or the resistor in his parts books. If anyone can 
give me the relay and resistor part numbers or the wattage, resistance and 
mounting location of the resistor, I would surely appreciate it.

I would also like to put the two driving lamps on a separate switch from the 
high beams. If anyone has done this I would like to hear from you.

TIA, Tim
