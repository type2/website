  &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;Steve,
  &gt;&gt;         I have two vehicles fully insured in Christchurch, New Zealand and 
  &gt;&gt; a '67 bus with minimum coverage in Arizona.  I pay less annually for the 
  &gt;&gt;two in NZ than the crappy coverage in AZ for 6 months.  Gary Gibson
  &gt;&gt;------------------------------

[...]

&gt;However, both places contain some of the most beautiful locations on the
&gt;planet and NZ has the friendliest people I've ever run across.  In fact, I
&gt;could use an ice cold Dominion Bitter Double Brown right now.

then Jim aka Rusty says:

&gt;Hopefully y'all think that there are some of the &quot;friendliest people&quot; in
&gt;Arizona also! Contact me when traveling through **in a VW with insurance **
&gt;and I'll prove it. In fact, please bring the ice cold Dominion Bitter Double
&gt;Brown with you and I'll provide the Mexican food! =)


I used to spend 2 months every year in Christchurch, NZ.  Yep, friendly
people, those Kiwi's!

Now I live in AZ.  Yessir, friendly people, those 'zonians!

However, some of the nicest, friendliest people I've met (figuratively,
at least), are right here on this list!

Now, that means that Gary Gibson, who seems to have a connection with all
three, must be *the* nicest, friendliest person on earth!!
