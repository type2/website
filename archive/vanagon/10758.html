&gt;&gt;Rockhill brake parts makes an aftermarket replacement.  I believe the
&gt;&gt;part # is 11-1560.  It is available at my FLAPS for $45.
&gt;
&gt;Is this a dual-circuit unit?  The one for my '61 is only $19...

Yes.  I can get the the '58-66 master cylinders for $15.

&gt;&gt;Send me an early Westfalia tent, full length roof rack, and '55-'63
&gt;&gt;wheel cylinders to show your gratitude.
&gt;
&gt;Did I buy up all of the remaining wheel cylinders from BFY?  :-)
&gt;

If you know a source for front and rear '55-63 wheel cylinders for less
than $35/ea please let me know.
