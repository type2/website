I know that there are many, like me, on this list who only have 
access through work.  I know that my Internet access is monitored and 
every site I visit is listed for possible review.  My email is monitored only 
in that they know the number I receive, but not the content.  My 
server is set up so that I CANNOT get ANY newsgroups.  Obviously I 
would prefer to keep it like it is, where it is.  I use digest to 
limit message quantities.

&gt; I like the idea of a newsgroup. That way when I go away for the weekend
&gt; I don't have 250 new mail messages waiting for me. I can easily browse
&gt; a newgroup and look at the threads to see if I am interested.

So, what you are saying is that we should unsubscribe to the list, and
use this site instead?  Sounds good.  Any negatives?
