remember, when the PC 600 is putting out 5 amps, then (110*5 =
550Watts) it is drawing MORE THAN 45 amps from the
alternator/battery.

Scares me to think that the PC 1500, at full blast, could draw more
than (1500/12 = 125) 125 amps from the alternator/battery combo.  

Better get an extra laternator while you're at it!!!!!

Cetin - Very valid point, except :  your numbers are at 100% conversion
efficiency.  The real world won't allow that - probably better add at least
20% to your numbers!
