About the remark of the EV having a side-mounted fuel tank (by
the disgruntled EV owner at the SF show)...obviously this
person does not know much about his/her van...the only
thing
side mounted about the EV gas tank is the filler area...the tank
is snugly mounted between the frame rails just aft of the driver's
compartment...

Oh well...what do you expect from someone who is whining about plastic
bumpers!
