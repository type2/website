Subject: Antifreeze vapors

We had an interesting problem crop up. I had turned the rear heat off on
our 86 westy syncro about three weeks ago(efven the tundra heats up sooner
or later), but now when I turn the heat on only in the front, we get a
strong odor (aroma ) of antifreeze. Where (in heck) do I check!(my check
for the list goes in the mail tomorrow). There do not seem to be any leaks
in front. The odor gets stronger if you turn the heat on more! Ideas?
Thanks all. Oh, he also seems to be runnning okay temp wise.
