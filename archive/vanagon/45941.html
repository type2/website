Subject: help, clutch cable replacement, '66 Kombi

Hi. First, I would like to thank those of you who helped solve my previous
problems. I had a rubber hose running from my air cleaner to an opening on
the upper right of the fan shroud. The results of my inquiry are that the
hose on the bottom of my air cleaner is the carburetor pre-heat hose (which
I probably don't need in San Diego), and that the opening on the top of the
fan shroud is supposed to be connected to the gas fume coffee can-thingy
(which I lack). Someone proposed that the connection of the fan shroud tube
to the air cleaner was a &quot;poor-man's turbo&quot; designed to increase air flow
to the carburetor at higher rpms. However, I didn't notice any change in
performance after disconnecting it. I finally resolved this problem by
plugging the hole in the fan shroud with some dense rubber foam, and
plugging the carburetor pre-heat hose hole in the rear engine tin with the
bottom of a Pepsi[TM] can and a couple machine screws. 

Yesterday, on the way to Independence Day festivities, my clutch cabe
broke. Luckily, this was only about a mile from home, so I was able to limp
back to get the backup car. I plan on replacing it this weekend. I have a
few questions: Which components, as a matter of course, should I be sure to
replace besides the clutch cable? Should I clean out the clutch cable tube,
and how should I do it? Finally, my clutch cable tube is open in the front;
that is, there is no grommet/cap/rubber seal on it. Is this ok, or am I
missing a part that belongs there? As is, it seems that a lot of road grime
would collect in the tube. Thanks in advance,
