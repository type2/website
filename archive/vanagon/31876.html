How much do you fill the '80 Vanagon's 4-sp tranny? Keep putting it in
until it overflows the filler hole, as on the '71? Even though the filler
hole is higher (if that's what it is) than the '71's filler hole?
==================
I think that you fill it until if wants to come out the filler hole. Perhaps
others here can confirm that.  HOWEVER - I recommend that if you wish to drain
and refill your gear box you work in the following sequence:  1) remove filler
plug, 2) remove drain plug and drain old fluid, 3)  replace drain plug, 4)
fill, 5) replace fill plug.

The reason being: if you drain the old fluid and then discover for some reason
you are unable to get the fill plug loose you have a gearbox with no lube in
it and will be unable to replace the lube!
