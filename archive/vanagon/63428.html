&gt; Ok. I took the engine and tranny out and the release shaft fork is broken off.
&gt; I need to replace the release shaft, and it looks like I can get one by
&gt; tomorrow (fingers crossed). However, I have yet to figure out how the hell I
&gt; remove it.  Anyone who knows how to remove it -- I can't find it in Bentley --
&gt; please give me a clue!

According to my Clymer..........

&quot;To remove the throw-out bearing release lever perform the following.
     a. Remove the throw-out bearing.
     b. Remove the snap ring from the end of the release lever with a
        pair of snap ring pliers.
     c. Pull the clutch lever off the release lever.  Some clutch
        levers may just slip off; others may need coaxing with a
        hammer and a drift or a puller.  Do not hammer on the end
        of the release lever; you will ruin it.
     d. Remove the pivot bolt.
     e. Rotate the release lever up and slide it to the left side of
        the transmission housing.  The rubber bushing housing and
        bushings will pop out where the clutch lever was removed;
        pull them off the release lever.  The right-hand side of the
        release lever will pop out of the transmission housing; pull
        this end back and slide the lever to the left.  The right side
        of the release lever will come free and out of the transaxle
        housing.
     f. Perform CLEANING AND INSPECTION.
     g. Installation is the reverse of removal.  When installing the
        center bushing, align the hole with the pivot bolt hole in
        the transaxle housing; slide the bushing in and instll the
        pivot bolt immediately.&quot;
