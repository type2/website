Subject:  rebuild again? - update, goodbye

refresher: 81 vanagon, 1000 miles on 2nd rebuild this summer, chirping
sort of noise on acceleration.

since i last posted i had a leakdown test performed, 30% leakage on #1
and #3.  compression still 125 all around.  good thing i caught it this early
this time.  assuming intake valves are not seating as air can be heard
coming out through the intake on the leakdown test, also assuming this is
a head related problem at this time, as the first time i sent them back to
mark stephens they 'freshened' them and sent the same pair back to me. 
but...i am wondering what the mechanic could have possibly done to
cause the same problem twice.  ideas would be appreciated.

since i'm supposed to be moving tuesday for a new job (2,300 miles) ,
they agreed to send me a different pair this time (not sure of the financial
details of that transaction yet, i just need to get on the road).  i'll check to
make sure the case is straight this time before putting them on as
dhaynes has sugggested.

thanks for the suggestions and moral support.  i'll keep the list posted as i
can in the future, but this may be my last post for awhile as this is my
last day at work and i'll be unsubscribing this afternoon.  i appreciate the
community here and am truly thankful for all i have learned.
