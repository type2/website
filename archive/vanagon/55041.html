&gt; Well it finally happened.  My invinsible Westy (83.5) is now surging after
&gt; driving for two hours.  When I step on the gas I get no throttle response.
&gt; It bucks a little bit at highway speed.  No problems when it is cold.
&gt; Idle is normal.  Any ideas?  Could it be coolant temp sensor?  Any
&gt; thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks.
