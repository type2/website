&gt; So Derek Drew says:
&gt; &gt; I was able to knock one of my labels off but I can't get the other label to
&gt; &gt; come off yet. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you think you can remove your label, by all means DO IT. I used a chisel
&gt; &gt; and a sledge hammer and a lot of bending back and forth once it started to
&gt; &gt; come off.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yeah, I can just see myself now.  Tap-tap-tap-tBOOOOOOOOOM!!!!  ;)
&gt;

&gt; 
You, know if really serious you could always grind the labels off,
but along Steven's reasoning, I would say, only with the tank empty,
off the vehicle, blown out with compressed air, and having set for
a few days, much the same precautions one would use when fixing
gas tanks.  But I also wonder if it is not a federal offense to remove 
such labels?
