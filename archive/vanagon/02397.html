&gt;&gt;1988 Syncro Pickup &lt;single cab with canvas cover and frame&gt;,
&gt;&gt;California legal, facotry wheels and top. 80,000 miles. Very rare.
&gt;&gt;$24,000. (206) 454-8066 Message phone only. I will return your call.
&gt;These beasts were imported into Canada, I've seen a couple of the double cab
&gt;versions, my personal favorite. No canvas up though. The $24K strikes me as
&gt;outrageous! Canada's biggest dealer for the Vanagons is Owasco VW in Oshawa
&gt;Ont., a call to them might start a reasonable search, especially if you told
&gt;them that the price could be up to $30,000Cdn. for a 5 year old vehicle that
&gt;sold for ~$22,500Cdn. new.              tim s.

a word of caution, however:

when importing these things into the u.s., our Friendly Federal Government,
in its unceasing effort to protect its Citizens from Themselves, and, at the
same time, protect its auto-makers from the Hordes of Volkswagen Trucks that
would descend upon these shores, will slap a twenty-five percent import tax
on that sucker! 25 percent!

point being that this fellow, trying to sell his already u.s. legal vw truck,
is also trying to recoup that expense of the tax. not to mention all the
fees and paperwork stuff that is additional to the big tax. i checked into
it a while back (wanted a double-cab non-syncro) and the price was to be
$8000 u.s., but the taxes and import duty ran it up to about $11000. :(

just be aware that if the truck is licensed in canada, and you want it in the
Unfriendly South (u.s., that is), well ... it's gonna cost ya. :)
