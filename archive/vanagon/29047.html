Subject: lubricating the cluch pedal

My clutch pedal (on '87 syncro) is squeaking terribly, but it's very hard
to get to--I haven't even been able to position myself to get a complete
view of all the moving parts. Has anyone worked on the clutch pedal or
master cylinder before? Is there some trick to getting access to this
assembly?
