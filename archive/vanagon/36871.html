Well, I was suppose to bring the pickup in to the 
DMV today so they could see that the VIN was correct.
However, I couldn't get the damn thing to start.  I hooked
up the generator and the rest of the regulator wiring
and was getting a jump start from the Sentra.  Well, the
truck would start, but when I removed the cables, it would
just die.  So I left the cables connected for a while thinking
the battery just needed more charging.  After letting it run
on transfusion power, I disconnected again and it ran for a
while longer.  Well when I revved it up, the headlights went
out and I no longer get idiot lights at the dash.  So I'm
thinking, either I blew the regulator. (Never was really sure
if it was 6 or 12V.  Or I have a bad ground.  I'll get to
mess with it again tonight.
