&gt; Last I saw on PBS a show called something like 'B-29: Frozen in time'.
&gt; I missed the start of the show but it was about a dozen or so people 
&gt; who try to rescue a WWII era B-29 that has been frozen somewhere.  

This was an incredible show.  I sat watching it spell-bound with 
my two kids on my lap, ages 4 and 6.  Very Grendel- esque in its 
attempt to retrieve *by flying out* a B-29 that crash landed in the 
Arctic in 1947!!!  Except Grendel got home.  Most tragic was the lead 
mechanic-- he was this incredible talent that worked with a continual 
grin on his face... until he developed a blood clot while in the 
tundra and died before the project was finished.  Perhaps it is just 
that the plane also met its final demise.
