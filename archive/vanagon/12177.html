Subject: Re: TDC, AC

	Matt Bushore asks how to id TDC on a 2.0.
	I had this same problem on my 914, where, for extra fun,
you can't see the fan or the end of the crank. 

	The answer is, for all engines, the distributor!
	I would jack up all four corners of the 914 for general access, 
then put it in gear and jam the spare tire under one rear wheel, pop the
cap off the distributor and turn the other rear wheel to turn the 
engine until the distributor rotor was pointing to the little notch in
the distributor housing that marks #1 tdc.

	The distributor is your best guide for TDC because the spark
plug is only fired when both valves are closed, which is the position 
you want when setting the lash adjustment. 

	A. Burczyk's right, exact 0 degree location of the crank isn't
important, since over 90 degrees of the crank throw on compression are
with both valves closed. 

	Note that with a 4 stroke engine, the crank goes around twice
for every one time each cylender gets to TDC (with both valves closed
anyway). So you want to use the distributor as an indicator in any
event. (That's why the cam is geared at 1:2 to the crank and the distributor
is driven by the cam shaft.) 

	On a T2/Type IV, you can see the fan too, so you could mark the fan
and shroud with a painted-on-line for TDC and 180 degrees out. Just
like the notch in the pulley on a type I/II.  You can also 
turn the engine over using the bolt that attaches the fan, BUT ONLY IN THE 
DIRECTION THAT TIGHTENS THE BOLT!!! (Clockwise). Just like using the fan 
pulley bolt on a Type I/II engine.

	To figure out whether that turns the engine in the forward or
backwards direction, follow the wires from the cap to the cylenders and
note the firing order which is given on the generator pedistal. 

	If you find one valve very tight, (eg 1/4 turn of adjuster
doesn't allow feeler to slip in) then suspect you're not REALLY looking
at a cylender at TDC! Measure twice, cut once and all that.

	David Kao, I'm pretty sure you can't adjust #1 and #4 at the
same crank position, since one is will have BOTH valves open (overlap)
and one will have both valves closed (TDC- correct place to adjust).

	Someone wanted an anointee of St. Muir. The man hizzelf would
certainly have disagreed. Gather the facts, sit down, take your time
and work it out. Anyone can be a disciple if they are honest and willing
to accept being wrong once in a while.



	I like Derek Drew's strategy for fixing his AC - I hope
it works, Derek. But I've also got to endorse Joel's advice- my
friend and Society of Automotive Engineers member Kevin says 
you should run AC once a week to keep the seals, etc. lubricated.
I *try* to remember with the Corrado. Kevin seems serious about
this so I believe him.
