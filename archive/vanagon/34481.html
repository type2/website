Subject: cold temp metal failure

     
     It's been cold here,   -24 degrees yesterday morning.  Around noon I 
     went to open the sliding door.  I turned the handle, and without a 
     sound the whole handle came off in my hand.  Inside you can see where 
     the metal failed.
     
     Looks like it's back to rummaging through junkyards.  Does anyone have 
     parts around for these ?  It's an 82 and it'll be a few days before I 
     take a careful look at it.
     
     cheers
     
     john
