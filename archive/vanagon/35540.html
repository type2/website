Subject: For sales - 2 Questions

Hi all. Seen in the Boston Globe this (2/18) weekend. All disclaimers apply
        For Sale
        91 Vanagon camper auto

        90 Vanagon auto, beauty

        Both at Wellesley Volkswagen-Mazda-Buick, 231 Linden St.,
Wellesley, MA 617 - 237- 3553.
        Descriptions as written in the auto ads. Go get 'em, campers to be!!
Two Questions - On very cold mornings I get a howl from my engine which I
suspect is my alternator. The O2 light and the alternator light glow
dimly(like me!) similar to the typical early 12v glow when your fan belt is
loose. Should I replace alternator, is there an easier fix, should I worry
more than I am now? Two - my rear chrome bumper is showing some rust spots.
What can I do, short of rechroming(gag) to stop the cancer. I don't need a
perfect job just enough to stop/ cover the spots. TIA.
        Mike, A Syncro Westy in deep snow is like a duck in water - smooth
