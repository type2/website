Subject:      Yes, another but different tire question

Hi all,

Here's a test of tire knowledge. If my '86 Westy calls for the COLD tire
pressure for 185/70-14 tires to be 48 rear/39 front, then what should
the pressure be for 195/75-14?

I would presume that since the internal volume should be the same for
both tires and the vehicle weight remains the same the pressure would be
the same.

Any feedback would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Denys Mueller
