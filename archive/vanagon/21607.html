&gt;I am a bit leery about
&gt;taking out that big ol' honkin' piece of glass and keeping it intact!  Any
&gt;points, tips, hints, or general foolishness you can pass my way on such a
&gt;procedure?

Jason -

This is a two peoples job.  Have yer buddy stand in the front of the bus to
stabilize the glass while yer inside with a single-edged razor cutting the
inside lip all the way around.  Cut as much of the inside lip as you can.
 Then GENTLY push the glass out towards yer buddy while he or she hangs onto
it.  I can't guarantee you won't crack it ($125 or better for a new one), but
there's less chance you'll will if as much of the inside lip is cut away.
 When it's out put the glass as far away from foot contact as possible ;)
Before re-installing, clean the body channel/flange the inner lip goes over.
 That area has to be as smooth as a baby's bottom or else it will leak - even
with a OE German, Crappy Brazilian or Bus Boys' Excellent USA Made Seal.  If
yer not up to the task, let a glass shop do the job.
