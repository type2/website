Subject: '78 a/c - where to add freon??

Hey all,
Today, through the arrival of the proper belt from Bill Lund, I hooked up my
a/c.  What a pain in the ass!!  Anyway, finally got it done.  Turned it on and
the compressor  compresses but I fear there is not much freon to compress as the
air isn't much cold.  We've got some illicit freon laying in the garage, away
from the EPA's eyes ;) and I want to load this sucker up.  OK, so where do I put
the stuff in?  couldn't find the port.  This is on a '78, btw, with a/c by cool
VW products of america.  

Any and all help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Sean
