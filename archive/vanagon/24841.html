&gt;I have a 71' Westfalia that I need to bring back to the land of the living.
&gt;Currently I have it garaged and I pulled the engine out. I bought it knowing
&gt;that I would need to do engine work. I ordered an engine from ECI out of
&gt;corona,CA. however they forgot to tell me that they were going out of business.
&gt;Well now I'm back to where I was....Needing a engine! I want a 1600 so as I
&gt;don't have to worry about smog restrictions. Any good experiences with some of
&gt;the other companies advertising in the current VW mags? What should I look for
&gt;if ordering an engine? Any info greatly apprieciated!

 Hi,
    I have owned my '71 passenger bus for many years now and love it.  Two
years ago I had my existing engine rebuilt by a local guy who talked me into
alignboring my existing case and regrind (3 angle) a set of used heads.
Never again!  After only 15,000 miles the engine has low oil preasure, over
heats, blows white smoke when started (leaking valve guides, I think) and
low compression (100psi).  I'm going to yank this engine and keep it for
smog checks while I put in a GOOD engine...one with a NEW case (read Gene
Bergs catalog) NEW heads, full flow oil filter and dual carbs.
