Subject: where to find parts?
Date: Mon, 4 Nov 96 22:15:51 EST

Hey all,
Where do you Vanagoners go to find parts?  I want to find the RMMW of
Vanagon parts.  I know WCM sells Vanagon parts, I will have to get their
water-cooled catalog for its Vanagon parts.  

I'm also going to get a catalog from Delta Six (assuming they have a
catalog), I've got their number so I'm set there.  

I don't want to have to go to the dealer if I can avoid it.  

Any and all parts supplier information will be very gratefully
appreciated.  

Sean

			      &quot;Ha,&quot; he said,
			      &quot;I see that none has passed here
			      In a long time.&quot;
			      Later he saw that each weed
			      Was a singular knife.
			      &quot;Well,&quot; he mumbled at last,
			      &quot;Doubtless there are other roads.&quot;
