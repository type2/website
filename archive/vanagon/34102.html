Subject: Re:  Sealing wax


&gt;Wait!  I thought that sealing wax belonged, like other &quot;fancy stuff,&quot; to
&gt;Puff, the Magic Dragon.


&quot;The time has come, the Walrus said, to talk of many things:
 of ships and &lt;something&gt; and SEALING WAX... of cabbages and kings!
 And if the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings.&quot;


Or something like that. Quoted, probably badly, from Lewis Carroll.

Puff didn't show up till later.   :^)
