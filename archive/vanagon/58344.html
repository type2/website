&gt;like to know what other simpler options there are.  In my 92 VW Fanatic

&gt;connect the propane, add some venting and connect up a few wires for power
&gt;and the thermostat.  Would this be a viable option?

        This is what I plan to do with my 82 diesel camper once I 1)get it
runing, and 2) find a propane tank for it.  JCW hac furnaces, but they
require cutting into the outside body pannel of the van.  I wouldn't even
consider something that dosen't vent to the outside.
