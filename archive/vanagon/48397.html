Subject: Eurovan MV???

Howdy all. As my folks are considering adding a Eurovan to replace their ailing
Chr*sler (They've seen the light!), they are looking at campers. However, they
really don't want all the fancy equipment. So, I was wondering if they make
Weekender Eurovans? I mean a van with a pop-top and foldout rear bed, but
without the propane stove, refrigerator, and such? Hopefully I will be going
with them to check some out in the next couple months. It should be fun, and I
love the expressions of the folks at the dealer when I drive up in my splittie.
 Anyway, thanks...
