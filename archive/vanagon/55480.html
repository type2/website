Subject: autotrans (again)

well, it looks like the bushing and torque convertor seal need to be
replaced, between the engine and the tranny. (80 vgon..) 

i posted to the type II list but havent received any replies so i thought
i'd try y'all...

1) the manual says 2 special tools are needed, a bushing puller and a
bushing inserter. are these needed or does anyone know of a &quot;backyard
mechanic&quot; solution.

2) where can these tools/parts be reasonably obtained (a friend mailed me
a parts supplier list but it got lost in the emails :)

i was going to pay someone but $250.00 to put in a 10-20 part is something
i cant stomach...

thanks a lot,

stephen white
