Subject: seats

&gt;&gt;&gt;I installed some junkyard (but excellent condition) Vanagon seats in my 
&gt;&gt;&gt;'76 Westfalia, and they are infinitely more comfortable, and work fine. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;They are complete with the fold-down armrests, but did not come in orange 
&gt;&gt;&gt;and green plaid, so don't fit the interior color scheme (was VW on drugs 
&gt;&gt;&gt;in '76?).

&gt;Now wait a minute! These aircooled guys are taking the reserves from us
&gt;vanagoneers!#? What do you mean vanagon seats are more comfortable? They are
&gt;terrible!!! I know how bad they are kaus I got two vanagons and the seats are
&gt;the worst of anything I ever experienced. Leave them alone in junk yards.
&gt;Kaus my vanagon will need them someday. Well, can you at least leave those
&gt;GL seats alone? Kaus they got the worst arms on them. You can have as many L
&gt;model seats as you want. OK! OK! Just don't get too close to junk yards in 
&gt;California. You may have GL seats anywhere else kaus I am going to need them 
&gt;here in California.

If you think the Vanagon seats are uncomfortable, then you've never put your 
butt in a Bus seat.  Even when they were new, an hour was about all you
could take. 

Looks like I really riled you :).  
Then you'll love this: They cost me only $80 for the pair - almost new!
