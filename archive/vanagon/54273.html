Subject: Re: diesel fuel injectors???

&gt;         Hi volks.....another question
&gt; 
&gt; First day on the road with the vanagon...small problems...lost hubcap..found
&gt; in weeds..
&gt; 
&gt; LEAKING fuel injector...QUESTION...is there a procedure and a maintenance
&gt; schedule
&gt; to clean diesel fuel injectors???
&gt; 
&gt; I just finished removing the injector down to the head...WHAT a
&gt; mess.._dot_carbon everywhere ...I cleaned with a small bruch in solvent all the
&gt; parts and cleaned out the hole where it sits ...replaced all parts as tight
&gt; as possible (must be some special wrench to use that i dont have???) Haven't
&gt; fired it up yet...SHOULD CHECK WITH THE FOLKS ON THE VANAGON LIST BEFORE
&gt; PROCEDING...
&gt; 
&gt;From the Bentley:

Torques:
Inj to head: 51 ft/lb
Fuel lines to Injector: 18ft/lb
Replace heat shields between Inj &amp; head when installing.

A few notes about cleaning: 
Only use diesel to clean, or gas to remove carbon, but rinse 
immediately with diesel.

Leakage test for injector:
Should hold 110bar / 1595 psi for 10 seconds without leakage.
Opening pressure:
1740 - 1885psi (used)
1885 - 2001psi (new)

The shim inside the injector can be used to adjust pressure:
increase in thickness of .05mm increases opening pressure by 5 bar / 
72 psi.

Note: I have not taken injectors apart myself - this is just reading 
from the book.
