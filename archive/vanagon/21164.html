Hey I had the same idea! I also have this notion of a very modern looking
ceiling light that is comprised of a string of the clear micro lights and
a bunch of test tubes. Arrange the testubes in a tight grid say 4X5 and
have one light in each, maybe held in place with a rubber bung. Somehow
wire it so that there would be 20 wires running directly up to the
ceiling, thin black wires, that supports the light/testube.
Well it looks cool in my fevered mind!
