  I associate official recalls only with safety related design faults. If this
  were not true, and all design faults made a car eligible for recall, having
  a Fiat, Yugo, Chevette, etc. might not have been such a bad experience 
  as it has for some folks.

  I would agree that VW has a serious design deficiency problem on their hands
  with the wasserboxer head gasket and the secret warranty tends to acknowledge
  this problem. But until those head gaskets start causing accidents, I'd 
  suspect VW wants to keep it as secret as they can.
