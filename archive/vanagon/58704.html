Subject: Re: Bench Seat, Reasons, Child Seats, other things.

The biggest problem I have with the rear facing seats in not the seats themselves but the 
seatbelts. They tighten up while you're in them and can only be loosened by unbuckling them, 
letting them retract fully and pulling them out to a more comfortable position. They work well 
with child seats though.

The seatbelts make good cargo tie downs though when we put the bikes inside.
