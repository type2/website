Oh well. It seems whenever there is a list member wanting to sell their EV, 
it's far enough away to make it more expensive than the locally high 
prices. (Plane fare + time = Seattle area profits.) So, the mantra 
continues: there will always be another one, there will always be another 
one....

On another note, at the local vintage VW show &amp; swap meet this past 
weekend, I saw a few more VW's to add to the wish list: a '55 bus/fire 
engine with a '54 Westfalia trailer, a very nice dark blue crew cab Vanagon 
Syncro, and the only one that was actually for sale: a white Vanagon Carat 
with 72k miles. No price was on the sign, but the number was 206-243-6920 
if anyone is interested. And while this may be old news, I saw an EV 
Winnebago in the lot with a license plate frame &quot;1-800 RENT VWS Camper 
Rentals&quot;.  Anyone else checked this out?

Back to lurk mode,
