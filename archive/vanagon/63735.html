Subject: EV weaknesses

Thanks to everyone who has replied:

Got a nice little file to work with dealer but no messages from '96-'97
EV's.  Wish I could read a list from them.  That &quot;hits and misses&quot; on the
'95 was great.  

Another thing is , &quot;Why do so many of us use the 'edu' net?  Are we a great
concentration of teachers?

Gary from Maine
