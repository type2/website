---Old message--- 

&gt;Hi Bus/Volkspeople! Hope you are all doing good. Now, like always, to the
point.

&gt; The need for restoration references (books, manuals, etc.) prompted me to
ask &gt;the kind people of &gt;the list. The project will involve a 1956 Bus. Are
there &gt;books that are Bus specific? Help and &gt;comments are appreciated. TIA

 The need for books prompted me to search the Internet and here are my
findings so far:

 Title: VW Beetle &amp; Transporter
        Guide to Purchase &amp; DIY Restoration

 Author: Lidsay Porter
 Publisher: Haynes Publishing
 ISBN: 0-85429-474-0
 LOCCCN: 86-82409
-----------------------------
 Title: Volkswagen trasnporter Onwers's Handbook of repair and maintenance
 Author: Past and Present Technical Editors of Clymer Publications and Floyd
Clymer
 Publisher: Floyd Clymer Publications
-----------------------------
 Title: Owner's Service Manual
        Volkswagen Station Wagons and Trucks

 Publisher/Author: Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft

 Note: Hints on repair and maintenance of Volkswagen 1200 and 1500 trucks
and station wagons

------------------------------
 I hope that this information does help the people in this list as well as
others. It does prove to me that a little persistence, time and computer
query power does pay. I heard that Chilton's made a restoration manual for
the transporter, as well. So, I'm in hot pursuit of this one.

 Wilma (1982 Westfalia)

P.S. The quest is on to find books related to Wilma that cost less than the
$80+ as in Vanagon      manuals that include the 1980-83 Westfalia models.
     Comments, suggestions and additional information are appreciated.
