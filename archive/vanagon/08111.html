&gt;Gel cell batteries are a different story. They demand much more careful, 
&gt;precise charging. Too much voltage and they will burst. A friend who is a 
&gt;battery engineer for Trojan says avoid these batteries...they don't last 
&gt;very long.

So Trojan has battery powered models now, eh?  I Wonder when Sheik and
Ramses will get into the act?? :)

(Turbo-coffee overload YAHOO!)
