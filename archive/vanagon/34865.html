&gt;Also, I'm curious about the rpm's my 2liter is going at when travelling 55 mph
&gt;in 4th (assuming everything is running correctly).  If anyone out there has
&gt;installed a tachometer maybe you could give me an idea.

You can easily work out what rpm your engine is doing at a given 
speed in any gear if you the know the ratios for each gear and the 
final drive.  These are listed in the Bentley manual (unfortunately my 
copy is at home).  You also need to know the diameter of the rear 
wheels.  I suggest getting the diameter of the rear wheels by measuring 
the radius perpindicularly from the ground up to to centre of the wheel, 
as this takes into account the 'squash' of the tyre (and resultant 
decreased wheel diameter) caused by the weight of the van. I'm assuming 
that a 14&quot; wheel's tyre diameter will not change significantly while 
under the weight of a kombi and doing 800-900 rpm at 100km/hr (60mi/hr).  

&gt;From memory the rear wheels on my '74 camper had a radius of around 30cm 
which gave me a calculated rpm of ~3800 in 4th gear at 100km/hr. I was 
quite surprised how well this matched the VDO tacho I have installed 
(~3800).  Someone correct if I'm wrong, but I think Bentley lists a '77 
manual trans as having the same gear ratios as '74 1800.

If anyone wants them, I'll look up the gear ratios listed in Bentley 
(1600,1700,1800 and 2L models) when I get home, and post them to the list.
