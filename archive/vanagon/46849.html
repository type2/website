Subject: 82 westy sink drain

Hi 
The hose connection on the plastic piece that attatches to my Westy sink 
drain has broken off.  Some have emailed me with ideas about replacing 
it, but a few trips to the RV supply store have proved fruitless.  Does 
anyone know of an after market source for this piece?  VW wants a 
whopping $60+ for it!!  For the time being I've simply attatched the 
drain hose directly to the drain.  Does anyone know if this may be a problem?
I'm trying to get everything in working order for a move west&gt;  Im not 
sure how long I'll be living in it, so I'd like everythin nice and 
homey-like!
thanks!
