Subject: Re: New life for worn out air flow meter 


I was reading Joel's stat report and wondered if there was a kind soul
in the Portland Or area that would let me swap out the Air flow meter
of a 83-85 Vanagon to help me verify if mine was bad. This is an easy
swap and would not take much time. I would gladly compensate.

How bout it Portland?
