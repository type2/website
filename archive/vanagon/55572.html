Subject: RE: VW buy &amp; sell / swap web page - READ ME! 

Sounds like a good idea.

Comment -- I was browsing a commercial classified page on the net last week=
.  Noticed that=20
VW listings where several times larger than any other make.  When you consi=
der that VW is a=20
fairly small player in North America, compared to GM and Ford, it is obviou=
s that a=20
disproportionately large percentage of VW owners are active on the Internet=
..

This would support your proposal.

&gt;hello! I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a web page for
&gt;people to post stuff for sale/swap and wanted stuff? If so, I'd be willing

&gt;enough interest I'll post one in a week or two.
