There is a 12-volt deep-cycle gel-cell battery designed for wheelchairs that
is
5&quot;w x 7&quot;l x 6.5&quot;h.  It's a 12 volt battery with 32 amp-hours reserve.  Cost
is around $80.

The cool thing is that *two* of these would fit nicely beneath the drivers'
seat on my 1990 Vanagon (12&quot;x7&quot;x7&quot;h).

My question is, does this make sense?  Would they deliver enough power to be
worth the effort?  (I want to run a laptop with a draw of 1.5A, as well as
the lights in the van.)
============================

Well, your question is a little difficult to answer explicitly, but here goes
--

If you use 2 of the above batteries in parallel, that gives a max of 64 amp
hours.  That means a theoretical ability to continuously  provide 1 amp at 12
volts for 64 hours, 2 amps for 32 hours, 3 amps for 21.3 hrs . . . .  

The operative word here is theoretical because factors such as :
o   batteries fully charged to start with,
o  continuous discharge or intermittent (you can recover more pwr with
intermittent loads), 
o  battery capacity as rated (new battery, as they age capacity tends to
diminish) and 
o  most importantly, the faster you discharge the battery, the less of it's
total rated capacity you can extract. 


Thus, if you put a 64 amp load on this setup, I would expect you to get no
more than 20 to 30 minutes of power, possibly even less.  [A good example is
the WWII diesel electric sub.- it could run submerged at full speed (8 knots)
on battery for about 1 hour and have an exhausted battery, or run at 1.5 =&gt;3
knots for at least 12 hours, in some cases close to 20 hours before exhausting
the battery.]

So, what you need to do is add up the current draw of what lights and computer
you want to use and establish the total load.  Say, for example, 10 amps-  as
number picked out of the air (12 volt light bulbs tend to draw around an amp
each, depending on the size (wattage) of the bulb).  At best you would get 6.4
 hours minus the drop off factor (whatever it is)  due to the rate of
discharge.  The typical load used to calculate the recoverable amp hours is
usually defined as the capacity divided by 10, so for your 64 amp hour
capacity, if you drew 6.4 amps you should get most of that total storage
capacity and 10 hours of power before exhausting the battery.

Now, assuming that this really is a deep cycle discharge battery, that means
(to my understanding at least) that the 64 amp hour capacity is what you can
recover and restore on a regular basis without damage to the battery or
shortening it's service life.  Check the manufacturer's literature.

Hope this helps
