Subject:      VR6 Bus now on-line

Hi Volks,

   For those of you interested, I finally got the pics of the VR6 bus
story posted on the web page.  Check it out at

http://www.relitech_dot_com/helmut/VR6-engine/vr6-engi.htm

   But do not stop by the Volkswagen Bus Engine Swap Page. The new page
is not linked yet. The description is still missing, that's a lot of
transnational work, please stay tuned.

Thanks.  Take care.
