Subject: Re: $25,000 in Syncro Camper repairs

Steve, 

If you had any idea where Derek is going with his Syncro(correct me if I am 
wrong, Derek), it'd make the hair on the back of your neck stand up (and your 
tires would go flat)!!  He goes where no other 4WD goes and has been know to 
make his own path thru' the bushes.  Derek is our EXTREME Syncro Pilot.  I've 
often wondered when he's gonna try skydiving with his Syncro (or maybe 
highjumping off of Mount Washington)!!!  'Nuff said...

So Derek Drew says:
&gt; I really cannot remember what accounts for $25,000 in warranty repairs for
&gt; these two vehicles. The repairs are so numerous and constant they they all
&gt; just blurr together in my mind. Through the fogg I can remember things like
&gt; these: all brake components, coil, air box harness, brain, power windows,
&gt; every rubber boot, all the camper equipment, a new $4,000 transmission (plus
&gt; labor), about 10 CV joints, a new ball joint (I know, its a $50 part, but it
&gt; took 23 hours of labor (shop rate $63 an hour) for a dealer to diagnose and
&gt; replace....

Wow Derek!  Either you drive the crap out of your van when you have it or
you have a real lemon tree.

Although I'm not real pleased with the reliability of the components that
I've lost, there are far fewer than you seemed to have suffered (knock on
wood, well particle board ;) ).  Yet the dilemma still remains.  What other
van can you buy that has all the amenities and thoughful layout as the
VW Van?  I can't think of one.  I think the only way I'd go if my current
'91 van were to go kaput once too often would be to buy an earlier van.
