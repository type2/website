I have a friend who has an '85 Vanagon that has the stalling problems 
I have heard talked about here before.  It will lose power and 
die while driving down the highway.  After letting it sit awhile and 
much scratching of the head it will start up and run fine.  Now I seem
to remember that this was some kind of wiring harness problem.  If I am
right, which wire is it?  If I am remembering this incorrectly please 
do help me out.  Thanks, Jim
