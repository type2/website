Subject: MERMEN WINTER TOUR /f

	If anyone wants a chance to hear my faves, the Mermen, they're
on tour for the next three months- possibly coming to a venue near you!
I highly recomend them, but do advise you bring ear protection :)
In my opinion, their distinct brand of psychedelic surf jazz is perfect
for bus driving, bus repairs or just humming while you watch the sun go
down.

	Gerry, if this isn't fair Friday content, let me know and
I won't do it again. Sorry Dave, the San Diego gig came already :(
