&gt;&gt;David, just for another reference point...I put a new set of tires on my '82 
&gt;&gt;Westy about 20k miles ago. I opted for the LT195/75R14 Uniroyal Laredos that are
&gt;&gt;carried by Costco (I went to the one in Santa Clara). They are a reinforced 
&gt;&gt;sidewall 6-ply light truck tire. Maximum recommended pressure is 50psi. They 
&gt;&gt;cost $49.99 /ea. Total price including mounting, balance and tax was about $250 
&gt;&gt;for the set. So far they've been great....quiet and good handling. The 
&gt;&gt;ever-so-slight size difference is imperceptable, at least to me anyway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

Erik:

Yes, I saw this Uniroyal tire last weekend at Price Club too. I just wasn't
sure if Uniroyal is a good reliable brand. The tire's load range is class C.
ANybody any comments about Uniroyal? Price club's price is unbeatable.
I'll probably go for it in a few days.

Thanks, Erik.
