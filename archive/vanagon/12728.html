Subject: Re: VW motor lifespan ? (A Poll!) (and other things...)

First, my '78 is up to 131K, no internal engine work.  Leaks like a sieve,
it's started to fart out the exhaust manifold again, gas mileage is down
to 16, and the back of the bus is black with oil.  (Okay, it needs a bit
of work, I'm waiting for the first 70 degree day). The only major work I
have done on it was to replace the fan casting and exhaust system when I
bought it.  The previous owner didn't adjust his brakes too often, and
then he parked it at the top of a hill.  Fortunately, the tree stopped it
half way down :-(

Second, VW sightings, with combined flame at our favorite auto 
manufacturer.  Here in DC, VW has started showing an ad featuring about 2 
seconds of a red bug driving away with the voice-over &quot;The beetle isn't 
dead&quot; cut to a new Jetta approaching &quot;It's just gotten better looking&quot;  
follow on with advertising blather...

Second (part B, the flame)
Now I don't have anything against the jetta, or any other water cooled VW 
for that matter, but to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen &quot;I've owned a beetle 
and that's no beetle&quot;.  While so many of us airheads are slavering for 
beetles even to the point of dreaming about smuggling one up from Mexico, 
to have VW throw this (or the &quot;Concept 1&quot;) sop to us is a dead flat 
insult.  The essence of aircooled VW's was that they were cheap, easy to 
fix, reliable, and fun to drive.  While the jetta may be fun to drive, 
and I have no data on reliability, it ain't  cheap and I doubt you can 
get the engine out and up on the bench in 45 minutes. In my book, the day 
they deleted the hole for the crank was the day they went too far.

Sorry to subject the rest of you to this, but I have been doing a slow 
burn ever since I saw this. Now back to your regularly scheduled prune...
