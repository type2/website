&gt; &gt; I've checked the usual sources, but couldn't find what the height of a
&gt; &gt; Vanagon Westfalia is.  Does anyone know?  (I'm wondering if one would fit
&gt; &gt; in my garage.)
&gt; 
&gt; My Westy fits into my garage with 2&quot; to spare. I have a 6'8&quot; opening and 
&gt; a roll up door. I had to adjust the door opener so it opened all the way.
