&gt;People accused me of going through one of those a few years ago when I
&gt;bought a used Thaiyoter Jellybean Van on impulse.  (I'm almost 43, so I'm
&gt;almost dead, too).  I felt foolish enough WITHOUT that observation, but
&gt;hell.  It was as good an excuse as any, so I concurred. 8^)


They're just jealous, Tim, 'cause they can't have one too.
Aren't people like that, a blast to tweak?  :^)
