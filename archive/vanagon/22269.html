Subject: '64 Shift rod bushings?

Earlier this year my rear shift coupler went out - (a two hose clamp repair
made it shift better than ever).  I did replace the shift coupler, but I
didn't replace the plastic bushings that seem to be at both ends of the
shift rod (where it enters/exits the shit rod tube).

Yesterday the shifter was way loose again and I only had 4th and reverse.  I
climbed under and it looked like the front shift rod/shift rod tube bushing
had moved forward and looked like a piece was missing.

I don't have a manual that explains the replacement of these parts (and I'd
rather not pull the transaxel because then I'd have to replace a bunch of
other stuff that needs to be replaced...).  So does anyone have experience
with these parts and what parts should be there?

Thanks!
