Subject: V6anagon/ Route 66: Day 3, Part 1  /L


V6anagon, Day 3, Part 1:

Was up with the birds in Oklahoma City. Could have gone further last
night, but wanted to see the site of the OKC bombing. It's near 5th
and Broadway, just north of I-40.

The V6anagon has behaved admirably for the first part of the trip,
aside from the stiff accelerator and occasional ignition hijinks.
It seems to leak slightly less than a quart every 500 miles-- not bad
by VW standards (mine, anyway). Re-installing the valve covers and
maybe the water pump, should cure most of that.

Once the tires warm up, the wheel shimmy seems to mostly go away, tho
the fronts are still badly worn. The wear doesn't seem to be getting
any worse, so maybe I lucked out on my &quot;tired-eyeball&quot; alignment. Still
wanna get it done right when I get home, tho. The rear brakes definitely
need adjusting (anyone know where the adjusters are on an '80 Vgon?),
the oil leak keeps dripping on the exhaust, the engine drones noticably
at speed, and some exhaust smell keeps getting into the cabin. All
minor problems IMHO as long as I keep a window open, and so we keep
rolling merrily along.

At first gas stop after leaving Springfield, the mileage for that tankful
comes out to about 20.5 mpg, tho it's hard to tell exactly. The PO says
that the tank had about seven (?) hoses coming from it to the original
fuel-injection system and to the filler vent, and he wasn't sure what to
do with them all. so he capped several and ran the rest to where he thought
they would  do the most good. Now I can't put more than 12 gallons at a
time into the tank, even when I know it's nearly empty; and the fuel gauge
never goes higher than 3/4. Anyone out there know which hose should be
attached to the filler neck? Aside from the big one, obviously.  :)

The Murrah Building site is grim. All remains have been taken away, and
a chain link fence put up. Grass has been planted where the building once
stood. People have obviously come by regularly, to put drawings, messages,
flowers etc. on the fence. Some of the flowers are quite fresh-- obviously
put there in the last day or so. Many buildings for a block around have
plywood where their windows used to be-- this can be hundreds for the
bigger ones. Structural damage can be seen on a few of the buildings, and
doubtless there is internal damage to others that cannot be seen from the
sidewalk. Nobody disturbs this site except to put memorials on the fence.
A church the next block over, has erected a shrine in its parking lot to
the victims of the blast.

Off to Texas. Tried to follow the old, original Route 66 where it exists,
but this proves less entertaining than tedious. Long stretches of the
road are now the frontage road for I-40, and to follow these exactly, you
must keep crossing and re-crossing the freeway, all the while seeing no
more than you would from the freeway itself.

At one point the V6anagon conks out again-- ignition again. Roll the #6
fuse, it starts, and I make a mental note to get one of those 30A relays
from Radio Shack to switch the switched-power circuits, particularly the
front cooling fan that the van obviously isn't used to. These are
continuous-duty relays, and have solved numerous headlight and horn
problems in my Mustang.

Stay tuned for Day 3, part 2... same time, same list!  :^)
