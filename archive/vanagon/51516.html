The damage occurs when the plug is removed, not when it is installed.  After
undergoing a series of heat cycles expansion of the aluminum heads and iron
spark plugs bring the aluminum threads into intimate contact with microscopic
irregularities in the soft iron threads of the spark plugs.  If the spark
plug is loosened while it is hot (ie, expanded) the aluminum threads are
liable to be locked so tightly to the plug that the loosening torque will
exceed the shear-strength of the aluminum threads.  The hotter the engine,
the more likely this shearing will occur.  If the head is allowed to cool to
a temperature comfortable to the hand, the chance of stripping the threads is
greatly reduced.

When dissimilar metals are torqued together (the spec for spark plugs is
about 22 ft/lb) it is vital to use some type of anti-sieze compound.  In the
case of spark plugs for air-cooled engines the compound must be one with a
very low thermal resistance, such as copper, aluminum or graphite, in that
order of preference.  Lead-based compounds should be avoided.

When conducting a compression test all of the sparking plugs should be
removed.  It is important to clean the area around the plug so rotation of
the engine during the compression test will not suck debris into the
combustion chambers.

The engine should be cranked a uniform number of turns for each cylinder.
 The compression gauge should be the averaging type attached to a fitting
that threads into the spark-plug hole to form a gas-tight seal.

It is unwise to perform a compression test on an engine that has not been
operated for some time as the lack of lubrication on the cylinder walls can
give a falsely low reading and may, in the case of engines coming from
prolonged storage, result in damage due to undiscovered rust on the cylinder
walls.  (Engines should be stored with the valves closed.)    

Compression testing yields the most uniform results when the engine has been
recently operated and is warm to the touch.  Since oil is normally added to
the cylinder prior to taking the 'wet' compression reading, it is wise to
reinstall the spark plugs and operate the engine for a few minutes
immediately after the compression has been checked.

Due to variations in compression ratio and other factors compression testing
is at best a befuddled step-child of leak-down testing, wherein the cylinder
is brought precisely to TDC and the combustion chamber charged with
compressed air, the dissipation of which is timed and observed with
stethescopes and/or microphones to identify inproper sealing of valves or
rings.  Due to its static nature, leak-down tests may be performed for so
long as it takes to accurately diagnose the condition of the rings and
valves.
