Subject: Transplant from bug to bus?

Greetings from a short time listener, first time caller.;-).
We just got a 68 camper/art bus (painted by an artist named Michael
McDonald).
We call it WEEEEEE (as in- weeeeee! what a fun ride).
Actually, Katya our almost 2 year old, named it the first time she rode in
it.
We also have a dying 71 bug (betsy, by name) that has lovingly offered
herself up for part transplants.
It's already given up it's stereo and will eventually give up it's dual port
heart to replace weeeeees' aging single port. The dual port runs O.K. but
needs some work. The plan is to have the 71 dual port rebuilt and put it in
the bus, then rebuild the 68 single port myself (would be my first) and keep
it as a back-up. 
Any comments as to do's and don'ts or other helpful hints would be greatly
appreciated.
I have a Bentley manual and Muirs' book as technical support.
I am also going to put the bug's battery in the bus as a secondary. I have
looked at a couple of different set-ups at my local RV store. Any
suggestions?
This &quot;BUS&quot; thing can be addicting. We got it because we loved the paint job,
but now we're considering getting another one (his and hers - her being
partial to a split window).
We've even considered selling our 84 318i to fund the whole project.
One more point, when this whole project is done, we will have a somewhat
stripped cosmetically challenged bug shell. Any suggestions?
