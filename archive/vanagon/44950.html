Subject: Re: Diesel coolin problems

Joel, Thanks fro your help!
I took a closer look at the van this am, found no split hoses.  I did 
discover that the thermostat is shot, however.  This is at least part of 
the problem. OK, dumb question time. When thumbing through Bentley, I 
noticed that the tank in the book has a wire coming off the top of it.  
is this the sending unit for the gauge?  My tank has no plug for the wire to 
connect with, although the wire IS there. My coolant sensor light did 
come on and temp gauge did risewhen the problem 1st occured?
  Does anyone know whether the diesel's thermostat is interchangeable 
with a gas engine van? 
 Is there any way to check the coolant tank cap without use of the tester 
as described in Bentley? Can I assume the cap is bad because the tank 
exploded?
I appreciate any input.. Im trying to get her running to go to Litchfield
tomorrow!
Thanks Paul
