&gt; &lt;&lt; I tried them in my 90 Carat, and again in my '89 Syncro.  (Same motor due
&gt; to a
&gt;  minor mishap in 95, i.e., we rolled it.)
&gt; 
&gt;  The Platinum's corroded and wore so badly that after 6 months they were
&gt;  useless.  I'm really not sure why.  Both local Dealer (West Side VW) parts
&gt;  guys, and several other reputable contacts I know said stick with the stock
&gt;  plug.  I'm now on stock plugs, and will see how they wear after a month or
&gt;  two.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Wow!!!  I'm shocked at the short life of your platinums.  Our 88 is on it's
&gt; third set now at over 120,000 miles.  I just put them in a few months ago
&gt; making over 50,000 miles for each of the first two sets.  Similar performance
&gt; in my 87.


I too am shocked.  Are you sure you don't have a head gasket leak or
other problem that would  let moisture in to the plug.

I've used platinums on 2 super bugs, a bus, a honda, and my vanagon and
never had a problem.
