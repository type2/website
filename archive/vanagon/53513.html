Subject: A forgoten sighting...


Oh!!! i just remembereed a cool sighting from my trip up here..

Driving along 78 through ( i think..) missisippi..

me heading west (approx..:) and coming the other way was a hippytippy 
sort of bus..but it was a v-gon westy!!! all painted up..dont see 
vanagons like that too often..

i was tempted to (after i finished crossing the bridge...) spin accross 
the median and go chasing...since there was zero traffic..but i didnt..i 
dont know why..


anyhow...(hey! if thats YOU, then i was the one on the red bubble westy..:)
maybe somebody know's 'em..:)

later....david
