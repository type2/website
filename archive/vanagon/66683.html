Thanks Doug.

I am a Mac person and I would prefer JPG or TIF files or even BMP in a
pinch.  The MAC thing is a format I have not used for years.  We Mac
folks are not so hung up on three place extensions.  Life just seems
easier when you don't have to abbreviate everything to three places.

P.S.  I also use a pc with windows nt.  still prefer the mac.
