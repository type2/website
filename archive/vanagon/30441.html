Subject: '71 westy FS near SF bay area


A music acquaintance of mine is selling his camper, and I volunteered to
post it to the list.  Haven't seen the car in a few years, so you'd best
phone him for details.

'71 Westfalia camper with poptop, sink, bed, etc.  $2,800.  He says
the condition is excellent, and that the engine rebuild has the block
from Holland, rather than from Brazil.

You can reach him (Tom Duckworth) at 510.886.1396
