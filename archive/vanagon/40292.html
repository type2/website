Subject: 78 Bus sputtering

Posting for a friend,
 he has a 78 bus that sputters/stalls after warming up and driving for 
about 15 minutes.  It never completely stalls and it's periodic.  He's had
a mechanic look at it but didn't solve the problem.  I know this isn't much
to go on, but any ideas?  You can email me direct.  Thnaks.
 
-Scott.
