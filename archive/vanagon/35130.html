Subject: TENT HELP!!!--How do I set up this !_at_#%$$%#^Tent

Hi,

Well the tent I Bought from a guy who advertised in Limbo Newsletter arrived
today and looks to be in really good shape.  I probably paid a bit to
much($325 plus shipping) but they are so hard to find and I really wanted
one.  It appears to be complete, but has no instructions.  I can tell that
after the first time it will probably be fairly easy to put together, but I
want to make sure that I set it up correctly.

It is the orange &amp; Blue one with the Blue and Red stiping on the door
awning.  Just like the one in the picture David Put up on his web page a
week ago.  

Does anyone have instructions, a manual or something that comes with the
tent?  Is iT small, can it be faxed?  I will be happy to pay for postage and
copying if necessary.  

My fax number is 310-478-1327

Thanks for the help!

I hope someone out there has this!!

Joe
