Subject: Water under back seat

Thanks everyone for you help with my propane tank problem and sticky 
locks.  Now another..  I have water under my back seat ('85 Westy&quot;)&amp; 
can't figure out where it's coming from. We recently replaced all the 
roof seals (Bus Boys-great seals!) I'm sure it's not coming from there.  
There is just a little in each channel along the sides. Any thoughts?
