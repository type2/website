Subject: RE: local VWs for sale; auto show


&gt;Bainbridge paper had the following ad:
&gt;
&gt;'83 VW Vanagon camper, 5 spd, good cond, stereo,
                        ^^^^^
&gt;sink, refrig, Z-bed, 95K miles, $2850/obo
&gt;206-842-9588


Just when I thought it was safe to go back into the water...

Always heard that there were no 5-speed vanagons, except one year
a few diesels had them. You'd think the guy would have said &quot;diesel&quot;
if this was one.

Was what I heard wrong? Or, must this be one of those rare diesel 5-speeds?
Maybe even a diesel 5-speed that's been converted to gas?

Opinions, anyone?

Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '71 VW Transporter, 4spd
                              '80 V6anagon, REALLY needs an overdrive gear

P.S. I just broke down and called the seller, even tho I'm not in buying
mode. It is a diesel 5-speed. So... &lt;never mind!&gt;
