&gt; The bolt that I would use to tighten the alternator belt seems to be 
&gt; frozen.  I don't want to strip it any further, so do any of you have some 
&gt; ideas on how to loosen it??  I've only owned the bus since last summer, 
&gt; and I haven't changed the belt yet.  

Hmmm... good one.  You can't loosen it from behind because the nut
is shaped in a special way to keep it from turning, and it works very
well.  I would start by soaking it with Mopar Heat Valve Penetrant, but
be careful not to let any get inside the alternator.  Probably the best
way would be to cut some sort of slot in the top of the bolt and use a
mondo screwdriver to get it out.  Maybe use a dremel with a teeny weeny
cutting disc, if there is such a thing?

&gt; 						Also, where do you place a bar to 
&gt; keep the alternator in place when tightening the bolt??  I've done this 
&gt; on other cars, but it would be nice to know ahead of time here.  

Please don't do this - it's not necessary.  100% of the alternator
covering tin pieces I have seen have been bent up by someone sticking a
screwdriver in the hole near the adjusting bolt and levering.  A simple
push of the alternator pulley with your left hand while you tighten the
adjusting bolt with your right is all that is necessary.  If you can't
move the alternator in this way, loosen the bottom bolt from underneath
until you can.  The alternator pulley is contacted by the belt across
about 250 degrees of it's surface, and doesn't need much tension to
grip.  Plus, it's bad for the alternator bearings to run a tight belt.
