Subject: syncro driveline universal joints

	Kris,
	Is the syncro driveline a true univeral (aka Hooke or Rose) 
joint or a cv? Two forks and a cross linking them?  Or rubber boots 
and a ring full of big ball bearings? If its a Hooke joint, you just
need new bearings, not a new joint. Is the dealer price $145 for a new
bearing kit OR a new cross AND bearings OR is there a cross + bearing
assembly which bolts on at both ends? Even VWOA can't sell four
bearings for $145, can they?

	Lets just say I was given a '62 Triumph Herald for good reasons
and I accepted it for similarly good reasons. One of the the drive shaft
Hooke joint bearings had lost its needle rollers YEARS before. Made a 
WAY big KLUNK whenever acceleration passed through zero and it had to
move 1/2 inch to the other rubbing surfaces... Of course I only drove 
it that way in the interest of science...

	 The bearings themselves were found at a specialist in Brit cars,
and probably about $5 each. But Liquid Wrench and gentle persuasion failed 
to produce the disassembly results the manual promised.

	The local high-quality, non-chain FLAPS, &quot;A &amp; M Motor Supply&quot;, 
quoted $30 an end to replace universal joint bearing. I think they needed 
it for a weekday. Counter guys thought it was pretty funny- the machinist
spent over an hour doing the job.

	Morals: Quality doesn't cost more- once things get funky enough,
flat-rate mechanics can SAVE you money :)

	Good luck,
	Bill
