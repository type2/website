Subject:      Battery and Battery compartment

While exploring my new Westy, I stumbled upon the primary battery
compartment.  Could this be in a more inconvienient to get to?
Am I missing sonething?

The owners manual says to push the passengers seat all the way
forward to access.  Even all the way forward I can't access the front
screws on the plate that covers the battery.  Swiveling the seat 45
degrees allows access to these screws, but I don't see how it would be
possible to remove the battery if need be (Without removing the
entire seat).  The manual implies that there is a storage compartment
under the seat with bolts to remove the seat, but I can locate no
storage compartment.

Under the drivers seat is a nice hinged panel to acces the second
battery compartment.  Is the passengers side a DPO conversion?

Any tips on battery access would be appreciated.

If you needed to jump start the vehicle, where would you ground
the negative terminal to?  (I'm used to grounding it on the engine)

The battery also requires some maintenace (add water, etc?).  I have
never owned a battery like that, nor do I have a manual.  How do I check
the water level?  How much to add?  Is tap water OK?  Can I replace
this battery with a maintenace free battery?  Any reccomenendations?

Thanks
Stephen Jones
