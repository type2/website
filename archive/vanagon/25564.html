Subject: Propane While Driving (response)

It is true that there is some danger of having propane mixed up in the car
in the event of an accident but I drive with the fridge on regularly anway.
For one thing, the pressure isn't very high since the propane lines into the
camper come after the regulator. For another, I like to make coffee while I
am driving and I don't want to turn off the mail valve. 

Anyway, it isn't having the fridge on that makes the danger. It is having
the mail valve on the tank on. I don't see that little flame in the fridge
combustion camber as being very dangerous.

As for 12 volt vs. 120 volt see my article on the gopher. 12 volts provides
just as much cooling as 120 volt. its just that with 12 volts you are
constantly turning the fridge on and off as you start and stop the car.

&gt;Propane is a poor electrical source.  12VDC is a poor heat source.
&gt;
&gt;Your dometic fridge from hell uses heat expansion heated by propane, 110vac or
&gt;12VDC to heat the exchange mechanism.  Doesn't work too well on 12VDC, works
&gt;lots better on Propane.
&gt;
&gt;BTW there's a flame sensor that shuts off the propane if the fire dies, req'd
&gt;by law in both US and Canada.

&gt;The trick is in a MAJOR crash where a propane line is ruptured what happens at
&gt;the regulator.  Does it mechanically detect high flow and shut off or ???

No.

&gt;Now where did I put that Dometic Fellers' card anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Any input, Drew, Gerry, Joel, billybob or??
