Tom -
There are two cords, the right ends in the metal slot on top of the 
fresh air tube.  To get in there, remove the glove box.  Disconnect 
the other cord, and lower the glove box, covering up the opening with 
hand or something. At just below horizontal, the rotating pins and 
the whole box can slide out to the left and the whole box comes out.
Couldn't find out where the left goes, it had been removed to install 
the power amp for the music maker, so I figured i'd tell you how to 
get there.  My left one broke also, using a shock cord and metal hook 
on the right side only, stronger than the stock.

The glove compartment in my 84 Westy rides on two shafts on the bottom of
the compartment. At the top left of the compartment is a plastic hanger,
much like a cord which prevents the box-like compartment from rotating on
the two shafts and spilling the contents on the floor of the passenger side
of the cab when the compartment is opened.

That plastic &quot;cord&quot; has snapped, and one end of it is still attached to the
box by a ball which fits into a slit in the lip of the box-like
compartment.  I can't determine where the other end of the broken plastic
&quot;cord&quot; attaches. Has anyone on the list any information about the location
of the top, supporting, attachment end of the &quot;cord?&quot;
