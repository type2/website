Subject: Re: VW credit card

You know, I occasionally applied for the VW card when they sent me the 
ads in the mail.  But everytime I would apply, they would deny me credit 
despite having some loans that were paid off with no late payments (good 
credit record).  Finally through my  bank, I got a $500 VISA which is 
great for mail ordering VW parts and it keeps me from charging anything 
of any great expense.  Man, afte that, I got FLOODED by credit card ads 
from all over, including the VW one.  They all went in the trash  too.  I 
figured if they didn't accept me when I need it the most, they weren't 
going to get me at all....
