 The VW LT is the big brother of the Vanagon and all sizes are extended by 
10-20 %. But in fact, it is an own series of vehicles. The engine is sitting 
in the front between the seats and is manufactured by AUDI. Volvo bought the 
AUDI Diesel to place it in their cars. I don't know, if this is also true 
for the 6 cyl. The LT is a very noisy vehicle, we had one at the fire 
department. The 4 WD version is a very good climber with extreme ground 
clearance and, if the internal furniture is well done, a good off road 
expedition vehicle.

 I know a German Camper manufacturer (Dehler) who extends the Eurovan by 
about one or two feet. Inside the extension you will find the kitchen 
interior.

&quot;NOW THE NEAT ONE, I WISH YOU COULD SEE THE PICTURE OF THIS THING.

'82 VW LT45TD, 4wd camper, 6 cyl Vovlo turbo diesel,
low miles, many spares, $30,000

Anybody know about this?  Looks like Vanagons big
brother, with a raised fiberglass roof, lenthened rear
end, but what might be standard vanagon nose (hard to
say comparing teeny picture to the '81)  certainly seems
to have Vanagon grill, lights, and VW emblem.  $30k
a lot but looks as big as the EV based big Winnie,
and this has got 4wd

Oh well in UT (801)645-7666 days (801)649-9719 eve&quot;
