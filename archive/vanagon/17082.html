&gt; container has a pressure cap, sensor, and two hose connections...

My home-away-from-home, the junkyards.  If you don't want to pull it
youself, there are some &quot;auto dismantlers&quot; that take their cars all apart
and put the parts on shelves, so you can just walk in and they hand it to
you over the counter.  You will pay for it, though.  Check the phone book
under &quot;Auto Wrecking&quot;.
