Subject: Van Racing...

	My brother and I were talking about going to one of the 
&quot;Drive your own car&quot; driving schools with my pickup and his
Vanagon :^) Heck, they're rear wheel drive, and the Vanagon has
more HP than my 914 did! Anyone know what SCCA class a 70 pickup
with stock, single-port 1600, would be in? Or do they only classify
certain models? 

	The other wonderful idea along these lines would be to
find a drag strip and go on 'grudge' night- match-race vans, for
the slowest 1/4 miles they'd ever have recorded!


	We may make some progress on the pickup this weekend! Pray
for this sinner, please!


	And now that about 5 people have mentioned it, I did have a
slight twinge when that European-american guy Ric mentioned the 
geographic background of the Caddy-driving JERK who dented his paint job. 
	And I don't want to hear no guff from white guys out there about 
political *($)##$_at_. I've got a life and it includes a little sensitivity
to the feelings of others, about what you'd expect from  being raised 
by a couple of white people.

	A story illustrates: My old boss Hugh was flying to Korea on
business. He fell into talking to the guy sitting next to him. Hugh
observed that it was about 25 years since he'd seen Korea (This was in
the late 70's). The guy asked &quot;Were you in the Korean War?&quot; and Hugh
said yes, he was. They guys said &quot;I wasn't, but my uncle was there, he
was in the 99th Division&quot;. 

	Hugh thought about that for a minute and said &quot;I never heard of
a 99th Division in the U.S. Army...&quot;. &quot;Oh no&quot;, said the guy, &quot;My uncle
was in the Chinese Army!&quot; Of course, the guy has Asian features, but
the nice thing about living here on the Left Coast is that one quickly
learns that appearance don't mean much... most of the time!

	Cheers!
	Bill, a white guy.
