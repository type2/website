Subject: Re: Nose skin transplant



Kevin, i have never done this job myself but have seen others do it.  
some succesfull and others not so.  the one thing that they all say is do 
not use a repro nose skin.  it won't fit right.  better off finding a 
good one of another junked bus.  i have also seen them try and graft in 
the skin at the window fram bottom.  it also did not turn out very good.  
other then that, good luck with the project.
God Bless
matt

&gt; I am in the process of repairing/restoring a 66 Bus and am at the point
&gt; where I'd like to replace the nose skin entirely with the skin from a
&gt; donor bus.  Before anyone suggests metalwork, let me preface by saying
&gt; that there is zero possibility of a satisfactory repair of the existing
&gt; skin. The nose took a pretty hard strike with a tire mmounted on the
&gt; front. Enough of an impact to crush the heater tube, twang the roof cap,
&gt; and crinkle the passenger side floorboard.
&gt; 
&gt; I took the bus to my local alignment guy who checked frame alignment and
&gt; looked for signs of other booboo's but nothing was found so I assume I'm
&gt; &quot;good to go...&quot; Doors line up well, windshield frames and all other stuff
&gt; seem unaffected. I replaced the floorboards on both sides (tacked in) and
&gt; they line up fine (don't understand why the pass side crinked?) so now I'd
&gt; like to remove the old skin and replace it.
&gt; 
&gt; I've done a few door skin replacements, and a fair amount of welding both
&gt; oxy/acet and MIG and am open to any and all suggestions from novices and
&gt; experts alike. I'd like to amass a wealth of &quot;options&quot; before taking the
&gt; dive and snipping the front of my bus...
&gt; 
&gt; thanks to all in advance
