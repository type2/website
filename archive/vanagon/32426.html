Subject:  Re: What is that thing under the seat?

&gt;is a small black box mounted to the side of the cabinet.  It has some vent
holes
&gt;and is clearly associated with electricity.  In fact is appears to have
&gt;connections to the 110V outside plug and to the battery 12V system.

&gt;I thought that it was the rear heater unit.  But that's just a guess.

Nope, I got one of those rear heater units in the center (sort of) of the bench
seat.  This thing is further over towards to driver's side.  Someone must have a
handle on this thing, its obviously factory installed.
