Subject: Gottabus! Revisited...

One more thing about my new (old) Westy... I need a windshield to pass 
inspection. Should I just try an auto glass place, or should I order a 
&quot;recycled&quot; one from those guys out in Michigan (Parts Place in Auburn 
Hills)...

Thanks for the congratulations, everybody. I feel pretty great about this :)

- Anton
