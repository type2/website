&gt; I am a new VW van owner (1973) with a slipping clutch.  I have a couple 
&gt; of VW repair books and have been contemplating fixing the clutch myself.  
&gt; I have a couple of questions that some of you may be able to answer and 
&gt; make the job easier.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Just because it is slipping does it need to be replaced?

Probably, but you should check the free play in the clutch pedal
first to make sure it's not too tight.  Basically, the clutch pedal
should have about an inch of free play at the top, and should
disengage about half way to the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I am new to VW's and mechanics in general.  Is this too much to 
&gt; attempt on a first try or is it pretty simple if you follow the manual?  
&gt; I.E. is there potential to do more damage by installing a new one improperly?

It's hard to mess up putting in the clutch, but you do have to pull the
engine.
 
&gt; 3.  How much extra wear am I putting on the engine by drving it as is?  
&gt; Lots? None?

As long as the pedal is adjusted properly, you will not be hurting
the engine - assuming you are not over-revving it.  If the clutch
disc is really worn, you can score the pressure plate and/or flywheel
when the pad on the clutch disc wears through.  You may be able to
hear this when it happens, or you may not.  Some people resurface
the flywheel and replace the pressure plate when they change the
clutch.  If you are one of these people (I am not) you might not care if
the pressure plate and flywheel get scored.  I only fix parts when they
break, and so far I have never needed to replace a flywheel or pressure
plate in a VeeDub bus.  Other cars are a different story, tho.  If you
drive the bus the way it is, just know that you are risking scoring the
pressure plate and/or flywheel.

It's also possible that you have an oil leak that is making the clutch
slip.  In this case, you *cannot* re-use the clutch disc.  However, in
this case you probably don't have to worry about the clutch wearing
through, either.
