Subject:      Superfluous Stuff

     Not being the list owner, I can only suggest -

     Can the collective &quot;WE&quot; exercise enough self control to take questions
     about non-Vanagon vehicles elsewhere?  Particularly non-VWs?

     Just because there may not be a &quot;honda_at_podunk_dot_edu&quot; or a riceburner_dot_com
     (and maybe there are), and just because Vanagoners are a friendly and
     helpful lot, doesn't mean it's okay to abuse the privelege.

     There's already enough baywindow/breadloaf traffic here (probably due
     to overzealous cross-posting from the type 2 list).

     For my part, I promise to refrain from posting anything about Jethro
     Tull, Italy, trains (real and model), VW Things, and Boy Scouts.

     Is it a deal? (Retorical question - answer not solicited)

     And please-

     &quot;me toos&quot; can be directed to me off-list
     &quot;screw yous&quot; cheerfully ignored (unless from the list owner)

     -Blaine
