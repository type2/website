Subject: Gas Heater Mechanic....

Howdie Volks,
Last month Dan Houg mentioned the GT Shop in Watertown, MA as a potential 
connection for VWers with gas heaters in need of repair.  I stopped by there
today on the way to werk as I had some snows that needed mounting and I am 
always looking for a good vw connection here in Boston.  I pulled in and the
mechanic shoveling snow noticed I had a gas heater running. (I generally let 
it run if I'm not gone to long.)  A good sign.  Told me the owner was inside.
I went in and met Bob Anderson and asked if I could get a couple of snow tires
mounted on my spare rims.  Nope, we don't do that kinda werk.  That's for 
young 25 year-olds, we're all over 50.  (OK, fine!)  Told him I had an old
bus out front with a gas heater in it.  &quot;A ticking time bomb.&quot; he sez.  Yeech.
I'm on the way out, this other guy gives me crap for driving my bus in the 
snow with all the road salt around.  Give me a break.  I'd rather drive it than
just stare at it.  All in all, not a good experience at GT's....
