In this week's Melbourne Trading Post.

1955 Split window kombi campervan.  good condition....$2000 (probably get it
cheaper) ......

Would have to sell the mutant bug and the 76, but were thinking about it anyway
to fund the 62.....and we have the 'slug' for ferrying the kids around ( a late
model Ford wagon with no soul at all)
