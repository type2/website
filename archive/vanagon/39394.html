Count me in.
For those of you that missed last year's circling of the 'wagens
in the desert check out http://www.rahul_dot_net/rrk/otto/redrock.html

Martha, our &quot;cruise director&quot; is across the pond on holiday so I'll
offer to take a head count and post a summary to the list on Friday.
If you're interested in joining us in the Mojave Desert for some sun 
and fun just send a message to:

(Don't reply to this message - use the address above.  My email setup
is a little crusty at the moment.  Only stafford_at_alcor.hac_dot_com works.)
