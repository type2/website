Subject: SAFETY: VW Bus belts

Hello all.

I am not a subscriber to this list, so please direct all responses to
stevenb_at_smc_dot_com or bernstein_at_smc_dot_com.  When I've compiled enough info, I'd
be happy to post the answers!  Thank you! 

I have friends (who live outside Albany, NY) with a 1986 VW bus and they
want to retrofit three-point harnesses in the back seats for their kids (8
and 10 years old).  Are the pillar mount points there?  Is this possible
to be done?  I would be very surprised if the original models in Europe
*didn't* have proper belts.  Where would be the best place to look for the
hardware (preferably in a junkyard in the USA)?  They're not too handy
with these things, but I am, and could probably be convinced to help them.

Any advice is most appreciated,
 .steve.
