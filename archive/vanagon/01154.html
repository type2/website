&gt;I've got a '66 Westphalia, and I want to replace the block-ice 
&gt;refrigerator with either a propane or DC unit.  Both types of units seem 
&gt;to cost the same amount of $$$.  I hope some of you might opine on which 
&gt;setup is superior.
My '91 Camper has a Dometic refrigerator that runs from 12VDC, 120VAC, or
propane. It works very well when running from propane, and can keep things
*cold* if the outside temp doesn't get about 75 or so and still quite cool
even for 90+ degree temps. Its performance when running from 12VDC or 120
VAC is awful in comparison. Perhaps there are other brands/designs of AC
or DC refrigerators that work better, but propane is the clear winner for
mine. The drawback of propane-only is that it isn't safe to operate the
propane burner when the vehicle is in motion. 

&gt;Three questions weighing heavily on my mind right now are:
&gt;1) How many hours of use can one expect from a 20lb. propane tank, or a 
&gt;charged deep-cycle battery?  (oh, and what is the going rate for propane?)
The fridge above is stated to use .176 to .529 ounces per hour. Since the
usage is also stated in grams per hour, I must assume that &quot;ounces&quot; is
weight not volume. When running from 12VDC, the fridge takes 85 watts
or about 7 amps, with the fan taking another .6 watts or .5 amp, so that
will give you an idea for figuring out how long your battery will last
between charges. As for the going rate of propane, I think it cost me
around $6 or $8 to fill a 20lb tank last year.

&gt;2) Is it feasible to use one of those small camp-sized propane heaters as 
&gt;a supplemental heater during those excursions taken in cooler climes?  
In a vehicle as small as a Vanagon or microbus, I'd be very concerned
about keeping combustibles, like curtains and upholstery, far enough away
from the heater. In any case, I'd also worry about adequate ventilation.
I prefer to simply dress warmly, use a warm sleeping bag, and forego a
heater altogether both because of safety and the trouble of carting one
along.

&gt;3) What additional components are required (besides a deep-cycle battery) 
&gt;to create a functional power supply, and is it feasible to self-install 
&gt;them?
I don't quite understand what you want to do. If all you want to do is run
the fridge from the deep-cycle battery, you'll just need wire that's heavy
enough to carry the current needed by the fridge and fuses in both the
positive and negative leads. The Dometic fridge draws 7 amps and needs
#14 AWG wire or bigger. Remember that a car battery is a small arc welder,
though, and can pack some mean energy if short circuited!  The complexities
start if you want to connect the deep-cycle battery into your charging system
either permanently or temporarily. There's been lots of discussion on the
list about second battery hookups so I won't repeat that.
