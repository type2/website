Subject: Progress Report, Drilling, and Bored Carb Throat

Hey Volks,

The rebuild is progressing nicely. Last night I did the final torquing of
the gland nut and put most of the sheet metal on loosely and finished
cleaning a few odds and ends. About all I have left is to install the
carb, generator, doghouse and connections to the thermostat...and I have
to check to make sure the thermostat's adjusted right. 

Tonight I also get to drill and tap the three holes for the rear crossmember
(this engine didn't have the holes). I'll be VERY careful! I understand 
that if I drill too far, all my work is down the tubes. I'm just not real 
comfortable with installing the engine without the cross-member since 
the only thing holding it up would then be the transmission...Comments 
and suggestions appreciated.

Anyway, in picking and choosing the best parts between my two engines,
I've come across something kind of odd on the spare. Seems that the throat
that attaches to the carb on the riser that connects to the heat
exchangers has been bored out some. Is there wisdom in this, or is this
just some high school hack that someone tried to get a little more power? 
I'm guessing the later, since the work appears to have been done with a
hand drill using all the precision of a grizzly bear...nice animals, but 
no opposing thumb.

I've got two good risers (one bored; one not). Which one would YOU use?

BTW, I'm on DIGEST, so I'd appreciate direct replies (and copies to the 
list as appropriate).

Thanks! Joe
