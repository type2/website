Subject:      Re: automatic vs. manual transmission

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;    I have found a nice 87 which I might purchase, but it has an automatic
&gt;transmission.  Would anyone care to comment on the pros and cons of the
&gt;automatic tranny ?
&gt;
&gt;    As usual, thanks in advance for your help (you folks have been quite
&gt;helpful so far with information, and I appreciate it !)

James,

I have a 90 Multivan with auto, I get about 3-4mpg less that some with a
manual trans, otherwise I'm happy with it.  Performance with a manual is
probably slighly better but were not talking racing car here.  Overall I
have no real preference and if I had a choice I would pick the van that is
in the best overall shape.
