Subject: '89 Westy Transmission Swap - Help Please!

Hi, 
I've got an '89 Westy with a yeech automatic.  I've found an '81 vanagon
with a manual that I can buy for &lt;$500.  What I need to know is if the
transmission from the '81 is will fit.  I suspect that it is an 091 4 speed
but I haven't had the chance to make a closer inspection.  Any ideas?

After I buy the van and strip the parts I need from it does anyone need
anything?  The body on this van is rust free and the engine needs work (I
haven't decided about keeping the engine, but I'm not going to need the body
parts).

Let me know.  

Regards,
Bo
