&lt;&lt; #1.  Why are they called power mirrors when they don't seem to work?
 
  #2.  Isn't there supposed to be a gray plastic cover over the hinges on the
 rear facing seats?
 
  #3.  How did all the cupholders get broken?
 
  #4.  The &quot;ground effects&quot; kit will not allow the shaft on the Bilstein jack
 to go in all the way - was this really designed by a German engineer?  Or do
I
 need a Special Editon jack? &gt;&gt;


here's the answers:

#1  they're just fer looks, they don't actually work....

#2  yes

#3  they come that way from the factory  ( I'm serious!!  :&lt;)

#4  use a scissors/bottle or floor jack, the Bilstiens are worthless (and
dangerous).
