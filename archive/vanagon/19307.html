Subject: RE: 71' for $3500 ?


_______________________________________________________________________________
Hi all.  I just spotted a 71' weekender in town (Duluth Mn.)  It has a 
rebult motor (ten miles ago), new carb, new exhaust, new paint job, no 
rust/bondo (Montana Plates), redone interior, very, very solid.  The asking
price is 
$3500 this seems like too much, what do you think?

   If you've got a reputable VW garage nearby, take the bus there and
   have them give it a close look -- the price doesn't sound too far
   off IF it's in solid shape (IMHO)
