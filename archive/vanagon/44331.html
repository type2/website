&gt;Anyone know where I can find the canvas tent for my pop-up on my 
&gt;Westy? Im just kinda lookin' now, (due to the fact that im broke). I 
&gt;live in Utah and finding VW Transporter parts is like finding camels 
&gt;in the ocean.

I recommend VW Canvas in Austin, 512-926-6195.  I ordered one a while back
and received it right away and thought the quality was very good.  I ordered
a replacement canvas for the upper cot last week.  Price for yours (and mine)
is $249 for stock.  Slightly more for fancy colors and less for no side
windows.  Standard disclaimers.  I don't work for them, was just satisfied
with their product.  They've also got curtains, awnings and seals on their
price list but I haven't seen them so I can't comment.
