Hello everyone. My friend with a '68 was interested in installing a short-
block V-8. Does anyone know what is involved, whether or not kits are   
available, or anyone else who has done anything similar?

As I don't subscribe to the list I'd greatly appreciate e-mailed
replys; if there is enough response I'll post a summary to the list.

Thanks in advance!
