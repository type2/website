&gt;Perhaps there is something to be said for not sitting in your car in the
&gt;breakdown lane. A few months ago a couple of people up here died in an
&gt;accident which involved having the back of their car crashed into while
&gt;parked in the breakdown lane. Maybe there is something that can be learned
&gt;from this most unfortunate accident!

When I was with the fire department in the east bay, we had a Semi
(articulated lorry) carrying tomatoes that had broken down and was in
the breakdown lane.  Another articulated lorry hit him in the back at about
65-70 miles an hour.  Needless to say, nobody on the crew was hungry for
tomato sauce for a while...

I was on my way to the station that morning.  I left sacramento about 4AM
and arrived just in time for lunch.  The traffic was _that_ bad.
