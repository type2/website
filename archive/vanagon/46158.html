&gt; Could we get a translation into English? What's a &quot;slacker bettie&quot;?

A slacker is one of this new generation of kids who grew up with
too much TV and video games and MTV, and spend all of their time
bitching about how it sucks to have no money, meanwhile making
absolutely no effort to get a job, and planning to live with their
parents until their mid-30's, meanwhile working at a record store
and piercing all different parts of their bodies 'cause they think
its cool.

A betty is a surfing term used to describe the non-surfing women 
who hung around the surfing crowd.  There was also the corresponding
&quot;barney,&quot; but nobody seems to use that...
