Subject: Re: &quot;Resto From Hell&quot; pics (f)

Ron Van Ness _at_ rvanness_at_neuron.uchc_dot_edu asked VanBondo if the &quot;before&quot; pic
on Mr. Heron's web site was really the starting point for the infamous
&quot;Resto From Hell.&quot;

&gt;Ellis fwds a note from Rusty:
Well Ron, in all of my years as a bigtime know-it-all VW guru I have
gathered the required experience and trained eye for picking just the right
bus for a restoration. Mrs. VanBondo and I looked high and low (mostly high)
until we found the bus shown in &quot;Rusty.jpg&quot; We were shooting for the pre-'68
Syncro westy action. The real tough part was grafting the poptop section
into the roof.
I know how you feel with that monkee thing, Ron. I get the strangest of
looks when they are screaming monkees. This is especially true in public or
in business meetings. I thought that I was suffering recently from cyatica
(what a pain in the butt) from sitting at the computer too much and not
enough exercise. I found that elimination of coffee and soda to get the
adreinals working better, more roughage in the diet, seeing a chiropractor,
taking up Hatha Yoga, a little more excercise, and the intermitant removal
of the monkees and spouse from my rectum helped tremendously. I had felt the
presence of both in that location on a regular basis for a long time. Phew!
what a relief!
More pix of the RFH are vaugely promised as VanBondo settles down and
cobbles together the official &quot;VanBondo's Totally Non-PC Web Page.&quot; First
things first. I gotta keep grinding on that resto or I won't have anything
to grouse about. ;-)

If it's real, my hat is off, I'm at full salute, and I may or may not have
&gt;monkies flying outa my butt.
