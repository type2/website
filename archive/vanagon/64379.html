The meter cover has been factory sealed at least on all digifant (86^)
systems, using something like a hot-melt glue. This is mainly to discourage
messing around, but also to seal out dirt. Poor contact of the pot wipers does
occur anyway - I think partly due to moisture absorbtion of the lubricant
used, since most problems are in humid or wet weather.

You can cure such problems by carefully cutting out the hot-melt and removing
the cover, clean the pot wiper and contacts with a contact cleaner and
re-lubricate. I've used a trace of molycoat with good success, but something
like CAIG chemicals pro-gold contact enhancer and lubricant would be better. I
re-sealed the cover with RTV silicone, which is easy to remove when you need
to do it again. (Both my vans have been fine for three years since this
procedure.)

&gt;I had a 1980 model with a similar box and the black plastic cover on top,
would
&gt;just pop off.  Mine appears to be glued on.  Does this indicate work by the
&gt;PO or the PO's repair shop?  Should that black plastic cover be removable
&gt;so that I can check out the resistor and wiper arm that hide inside?
