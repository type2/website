Subject: Rainy Day Blues Update

I towed the van to the shop this morning.  I had told my mechanic about the
rainy day problems and he was somewhat baffled.  Anyway, he found that the
fuel pressure regulator was bad.  He could not, however, explain how the rain
would cause that problem.  Any ideas?

Thanx Joel for the windshield advice.  No evidence of a leak though.

And thanx Eric.  Did not have a chance to try your advice.
