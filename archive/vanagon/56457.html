&gt;

Norman,

I just changed my tranny oil to Valvoline Synthetic and the shifting is
much, much smoother and easier.  Redline MTL specs out to work even
better, Vavoline is just what I could get easily.  Synthetic oils also
transfer heat better than dino.

Make sure you can loosen the fill plug before you drain the oil or you
could end up with an empty trans and no way to fill 'er back up.
