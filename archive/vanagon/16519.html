Subject: Re: Sink cabinet for 71 Westy-how to find

 right behind the fron passenger (U.S. :-)) seat - am I correct

yes you are


 other than the obvious luck of stumbling onto one at a junkyard
&gt;(which I've tried to do already).

that would probably be the easiest way, might try a swap meet or buying a
rusty 71' westy part it out use the parts you need and sell the rest,
either that or keep the spares!
