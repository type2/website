Since &quot;everybody's doing it&quot;...my Westy's
name is: Yertle; Yertle the turtle.  You know, kinda
slow, hard shell on the back, portable home, etc :-)

&gt;OK, OK! I thought I could sit this one out, but since it has
&gt;become an official list item now, here's the name[s] of my
&gt;'77 Camper. I call him, 'cause he's a he,  'Old Faithful',
&gt;since he never let me down. Friends in Seattle, where OF
&gt;hails from, call him the 'Northwestern Spotted Owl' for all
&gt;the black spots of the rust converter (OF has been patiently
&gt;waiting for a paint job during the last year). My friends here
&gt;call it 'the Buzz'.
