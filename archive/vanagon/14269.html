Subject: RE: redrock video viewing!

I have enough lighter outlets to power the whole &quot;campground&quot; (no matter that I 
only have one stock battery) so if you'd like to, we can view it from my 
Westie...  I'll bring my old VCR and the Watchman as a backup system...

The San Jose meet is at the San Jose Historical Museum, on the corner of Phelan 
and Senter Roads.  From 101 (Southbound) take Story Road Offramp West (South 
for those of you who are magnetically correct), go for about 1.5 to 2 miles and 
just before the first set of RR tracks you cross is Senter Road, turn left on 
Senter and about a 1/4 mile up you should see all of the VWs lining up to get 
in at the Phelan Road entrance...  The gates open at 0800 (8AM for you civies) 
on Sunday, April 9th...  For more info, call Rick Spohn at 408-683-0154 or 
SPOHN _at_ STLVM6.VNET.IBM.COM

I have a 9&quot; color tv, with built-in video cassette player, which I
can run off AC, or the cig lighter (if Burdley will ever finish
fixing it!!!!).  Anyway, i'd be happy to meet at the 9th
for the swap, and we can watch it in who ever's van.  Jon,
could you send us some specs on location, directions, time,
etc. for the whole group?

We could still do a potluck if you like...
