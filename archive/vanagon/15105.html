&gt;&gt;My '85 Vanagon has trouble getting started.  Here's the scenario:
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;depressing the accelerator when the engine catches and then driving away
&gt;&gt;immediately.  The engine runs rough for a couple minutes while I'm driving
&gt;&gt;(in a low gear) but then runs smoothly thereafter. I can smell gas when I'm
&gt;&gt;backing out of the driveway.
&gt;&gt;first or second try.  The second is that there's something screwed up in the
&gt;&gt;FI system that's causing the starting mixture to be richer the colder it gets
&gt;
&gt;i think you are onto the culprit, but have some &quot;facts&quot; wrong ... imho it's
&gt;the coolant temp sensor gone bad or the wiring/ground associated with it.

Uhm,  any seroius coolant losses, didn't one member mention leaks into the 
cylinder barrels due to poor O-rings as causing rough startup and idle until 
the H2O left the scene.   tim s.
