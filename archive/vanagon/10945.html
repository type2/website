Subject: Re: W. Coast Trip #2

I'm in too,.... I think.  But have we actually settled on a site?  I'd like
to put in a bid for a more central location.  Perhaps Morro Bay?  This seems
to be about halfway between SoCal and Bay Area. (Well I guess its a little
bit further from San Diego; Sorry David) Would this exclude any
unCalifornians who might otherwise come if it were at the Red Rocks site?
Red Rocks is nice, but I don't know if Carol and I will be able to make it
for a weekend trip.

Anybody else like the Morro Bay idea?

John
