Subject: 1700 to 1800

        I have a 72 bus with the original 1700 engine but I am now in the
position that the two heads as well as the pistons and cylinders have to be
replaced. GEX in CA sells heads waranteed for a year, and the cost of 17
&amp;18's is the same. The difference in piston &amp; cylinder sets between 17 &amp;
18's is negligible. Anyways the question I would like to pose is wether
this alteration from the stock 1700 set up to the 1800 set up would have
any drawbacks, or if it is worthwhile. Also if anyone has any suggestions
of other head remanufacturers that carry a waranty for under 170$ please
let me know.
