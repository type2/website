Subject: RE: '80 Vanagon getting chopped.

I really think VW should have put out a performance edition of the 
air-cooled Vanagon.
               Bradley 10/12/95

I just looked out in the parking lot to make sure my 180 HORSEPOWER 3 LITER
6 CYLINDER 1981 Vanagon is still there, and I agree with Bradley.  

Actually, I think the &quot;performance minivan&quot; market is a real opportunity
for any number of car-makers, but all they do is put badges and lower-body
cladding on the six with automatic.  If you want it done right you have to
do it yourself.

Speaking of doing it right, the other six-cylinder Vanagon that I saw in
Princeton over the weekend was an interesting study.  I have always been
surprised when people compliment me on a &quot;clean conversion&quot;, because it
was such a &quot;cut and try&quot; operation.  I was focused on getting it to run, 
not a factory look.  The other one, tho, made me proud: it looks like the
Bizarro version of mine.  Accelerator cable haywired to the linkage.  No
engine sealing at all; the same open look as a watercooled VW engine.  Wires
smoked in a small engine fire not replaced, since they still had SOME in-
sulation on them.  Opening for the oil tank gnawed out by steel beavers.

But it's been running for four years, so who's complaining?
