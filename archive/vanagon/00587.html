Subject: Re: radiator's life expectance

 Well,... it's easy:
   If the engine is hot and you see steam coming out your grill,
     it probably either leaks or something else leaks rain water onto it!

   If you see steam ,take a WHITE paper towel or clen handkerchief
     and pat it over the radiator, if it comes away tinted slightly
     the color of your antifreeze it definately leaks.

   The radiator is very cheaply constructed of plastic and aluminum,
 which is perfect for,e.g. a rabbit , when it is correspondingly inexpensive.
 For a vanagon, expect a new one to cost 250-350$. Look for cracks in the plastic seams check the hose connections etc to be sure it's not something
 simple.
