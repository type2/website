So DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; This notice describes a one time opportunity for anyone who wants a killer
&gt; trailer hitch to get a Class III hitch. These are not otherwise available in
&gt; the USA, or anywhere that I know of, for that matter..
&gt; 
&gt; My mechanic, one of the most knowledgeable Vanagon machanics in the USA, is
&gt; custom building a Class III trailer hitch for his two Syncro vanagons (one is
&gt; a camper; one is not). He called me to ask me if I wanted him to custom build
&gt; me one too and told me he is going to manufacture a limited &quot;production run&quot;
&gt; of these things. 
&gt; 
&gt; There are no Class III trailer hitches made for the Vanagon so I took notice.
&gt; A Class III hitch can tow a house around. The strongest trailer hitch for the
&gt; vanagon made is a Class I trailer hitch but to my knowledge, it doesn't even
&gt; meet Class I standards so you really cannot tow anything of any significance.
&gt; 
&gt; Realizing this is a one time opportunity I told him to make me up one too and
&gt; to design it so that it will protect the corner of the vanagon from a hit.
&gt; (As you all know, if you get hit in the rear corner your van will sustain
&gt; $3,000 of damage since the bumper simply crumples in. This has happened to me
&gt; twice!). (Isn't it a pity that 65% of vanagons have the end of their rear
&gt; bumpers crumpled in?)
&gt; 
&gt; A class III trailer hitch will also ensure that someone who hits you from
&gt; behind will destroy their car while yours will sustain minimal damage.
&gt; 
&gt; I think he said the price would be around $200 or possibly less depending on
&gt; how many trailer hitches are manufactured. You retain your stock bumper in
&gt; this setup. Installed is actually a receiver. When you want a trailer hitch,
&gt; you stick in in the receiver hole. My mechanic plans to use the hole to put
&gt; one of those basket things on the rear of the van--these are those baskets
&gt; that stick in a trailer hitch hole and that stick out behind the van and hold
&gt; stuff. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone who has ever wanted a trailer hitch who wants in on this project
&gt; should e-mail me. This is trailer hitch heaven.
