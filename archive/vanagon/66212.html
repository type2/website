Subject:      Recommendation for Vanagon Mechanic or Shop in Seattle Area ?

I recently bought a 1986 Vanagon Westalia and would like to find a good shop
for servicing, repairs, etc.. in the Seattle area.  Would you please email me
your recommendations (and shops to avoid).  If there is a good response, I will
compile them and resend the compilation.

Thanks - Chris Maier
