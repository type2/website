&gt;I'm also looking at R406a - http://worldserver_dot_com/ghg/ - (this is a
&gt;FANTASTIC site, with pros and cons clearly stated).
&gt;I went here mostly because I noticed that it was developed by George Gob[le]
&gt;at Purdue (who I respect, based on previous visits to his homepage -
&gt;http://ghg.ecn.purdue_dot_edu ) . I never realized that he'd developed a couple
&gt;of alternative refrigerants. R406a and its brother R414a both use the
&gt;existing system (except for new fittings) and are compatible with the old
&gt;mineral oil lubricant. So what's the drawback? They can go right through
&gt;some hoses (require nonpermeable hoses), and, according to one of the sites
&gt;I visited, the permeable hoses are quite common on foreign vehicles. They
&gt;are also not campatible with Buna-N seals in the compressor (they make a
&gt;replacement kit that uses Neoprene seals) and we'd have to check with VW
&gt;whether the hoses and seals are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; for using these
&gt;refrigerants. Otherwise, they claim to have equal or better cooling
&gt;characteristics to good ol' Freon (R12).

George Goble posts to the newsgroups &lt;rec.autos.tech&gt; and
&lt;sci.engr.heat-vent-ac&gt;; search DejaNews
(http://www_dot_dejanews_dot_com/forms/dnsetfilter.html) for author
ghg_at_worldserver_dot_com to read what he has recently posted on this
