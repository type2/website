&gt; &lt;&lt; Also, I read about Synrco's. What is a Syncro?  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Syncro is VW's term for their all-wheel-drive system.  In the USA VW began
&gt; selling Syncro versions of Vanagons &amp; Quantums.  Although they were both
&gt; called Syncro by VW, the Quantum actually used Audi's Quattro system.  Other
&gt; than both of them being all-wheel-drive, they have nothing in common.  Since
&gt; then VW has had Syncro versions of numerous models, but none of them in the
&gt; USA.  :(
&gt; 
&gt; The Vanagon Syncro was sold in the USA in model years 1986, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91
&gt; in both regular and Camper versions.

Do you mean that a model was called Vanagon Quantum or was it called 
syncro, the audi version?
