Subject: Re: 91 GL HEAD GASKETS/WATERPUMP

YES, I had the same exact thing. twice....first time on my 91 carat ...I
got burned too....vw replaced my engine....The second time was over
christmas my belt on the waterpump broke, causing the heads to fry.   
try  calling the NTSB or the Federal Trade Comission....there are
already a few cases out on vw....
and that recall on the overhead was a good thing...too bad it fell on my
kid before it got fixed.
