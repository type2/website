Subject: '93 (u.s. spec) Eurovan Stalls.....
Date: 5 Jul 1995 18:22:22 -0400

Any Eurovan owners out there with vans which stall after 45-120 seconds at
idle?  The van starts immediatly, but the stalling can be annoying when
pulling into traffic....

If feels like lack of fue, may be temperature related. Please reply via
email if you've had this problem.

many thanks,
moe walters
