Sam,

I had a similar problem with my '91 Westy.  I had to adjust the electrical
contacts on the van side to lineup with the door.  I think the whole this
needs to move up about 1/2 inch but I just inserted a wedge in the top of
the contact a its worked fine after that.  Let me know if you find a better
fix.

&gt; Hello again, everybody -
&gt;
&gt; Respecting that engine failures, leaky heads, major mechanical disorders
are
&gt; probably a lot more in need of your help, I do ask that, if you are
familiar
&gt; with this minor problem, please let me know:  The power locking feature
of my
&gt; '91 Carat seems to be getting a little sluggish in the sliding door only.
&gt;  Mechanically, the door seems to be fine.  I cleaned the electrical
contacts
&gt; on both the door and the jam, but I notice that when I lock the bus
globally,
&gt; either with a key or from inside, the slider either delays locking or
fails
&gt; to lock at all.  A little jiggling (sp?) of the sliding door handle
usually
&gt; 'wakes it up' and it then locks.
&gt;
&gt; I'm all ears.  Many thanks.
&gt;
