Subject: Seats for type II

We have '78 Kombi (camper conversion).  The front seats are getting worn and 
uncomfortable.  

Can anyone recommend a good method for obtaining new seats?

Are there aftermarket high back bucket seats available?  If so, where?  I am 
in Alberta, Canada.

I have looked at some nice used vanagon seats, but they have a different 
mounting than my bus and it looks like lots of work to adapt.

I would be very grateful for any advice!
