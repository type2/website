&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a partially stripped drain plug in my 87 westy.  I had the local shop
&gt; install a helicoil but it still drips.  Apparantly a helicoil is something
&gt; that retreads the old drain plub but it didn't work in my case.  Anyway I've
&gt; heard talk of &quot;expansion bolts.&quot;  My mechanic doesn't like them, says I
&gt; should live with the drip.  Any ideas or sources for an expansion plug.  I
&gt; doubt I'm alone in this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

Craig,
	I've been using a an expansion plug for the last 3000 miles in 
my 1981 Westy. No leaks to report. It is a Champ model # 19947 Oil 
Drain Plug made for 1/2 inch, 12mm, 13mm or 14mm holes - it expands to 
fill the hole and comes with a plastic tool used for installation and 
removal. Should be available at many parts stores, American car parts 
stores included. As long as you keep an eye on your oil level and leaks 
(as I'm sure most of us do anyway) I don't see any major problems with 
it. Since it is rubber, I'll probable replace the plug every 3 or so oil 
changes - since I don't have to remove it to change the oil. I use the 
round oil plate next to it to drain the oil. Good luck..
