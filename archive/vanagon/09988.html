Thanks to all who responded with info that this is a common, known problem
!  Well, I didn't know !  Thanks Joel for the service notice.  As  for
my engine it's fine ):0  LUCKY DUCK this time around !   And ...... I'm
glad to know that my Vanagon has something in common with the space
shuttel,  should I be wearing a space suit to drive this thing now ?

Cheers,

Frank
