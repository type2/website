Subject: I need a transmission (automatic)

 Howdy, as there are now probably many new people who have not heard my
pitiful cry for help, I shall utter it again:
I desparately need an automatic transmission for a late-latemodel bus,
as in 1976-1978. This is for my first bus, my baby, whao had been
sitting for a long long time. I am in Raleigh, NC, so something around
here would be really nice. I have a good running 73 automatic
transmission to trade, as I bought it because the guy assured me it
would fit, but it does not, and he stuck me for it. Anyway, please
please help me .
thanks
Richard
