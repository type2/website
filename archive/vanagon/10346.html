Muchos gracias, John.  Must check that out ...

BTW, it did it again this morning, only not as bad.

&gt;I had the same problem with my '92 Jetta TurboD--could 
&gt;be a (U.S.) $0.70 in-line glow plug fuse.  Same exact 
&gt;symptoms--lotsa white smoke, then an eventual fire-up 
&gt;and runs fine until the next cold restart.
