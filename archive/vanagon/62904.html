There are several on the market now that are phosphate and silicate free
and are &quot;long life&quot;. I am currently using the Havolin brand (please
excuse if I have misspelled, I don't feel like running out to the
garage). I believe there were at least four brands last time I was in to
see the Brothers Three. Cost: &lt;$6&gt;$7 p/gal ( is that right? or do I have
it backwards?)
