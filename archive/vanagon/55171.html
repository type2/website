&gt;&gt; Folks, we've been there, done that. Check the archives at:
&gt;&gt; http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg02539&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.01
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It explains the idea and gives the part number for a replacement wiper
&gt;&gt; relay from VW that will give your Vanagon programable delay wipers. $35
&gt;&gt; bucks or so, unless you dig one out the local junkyard. The you just
&gt;&gt; replace the current relay with the new one.  Many other VW/Audi products
&gt;&gt; have this feature: you can too!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Just called the dealer (Speedway in Victoria). Part # is apparently 
&gt;now: 1HM 955 531C, and is $ 47.72 CDN.
&gt;
&gt;Local FLVWAPS (BowWow) told me the &quot;1HM&quot; indicates a dealer only 
&gt;part. ie: they have a relay ending in &quot;955 531&quot;, but it's a standard 
&gt;wiper relay. Has anyone located an alternate source for this (other 
&gt;than used)?
&gt;
There is no such thing as a standard wiper relay. When a VW comes without
intermittent wipers it has a lockout lug installed in the wiper switch and
a jumper bus bar in place of the relay. Remove both and install the relay
and you have intermittent wipers. The 1HM, if it is designated by VW is
probably some type of manufacturing code. Or a redesign of the relay which
they then designated as a 1HM 955 531 C. If you have a 211 955 531 it will
work. The 955 531 designates it as a wiper relay. If you're uncertain check
the numbers on the terminals. I think you'll find them to be identical. HTH
