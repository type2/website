Subject:      Exhaust Leak? '90 Westy

Hey folks,

Well, I got up this beautiful Sunday morning, here in Northern California,
me and the wife got dressed up in our Sunday best for church and when I
went out to start up the Westy I heard the &quot;sound&quot;.  Sounds like an exhaust
leak, but I have not checked her out to be sure (going to do that right
now). Sounds like a loud external ticking, much like the normal motor sound
amplified. Can anyone concur with such little data? She only has 6k on a
brand new motor.

Anyway, assuming this is in fact an exhaust leak how serious is the matter?
To put things in perspective I am planning on a trip to Medford Oregon next
week (600-700 miles) and I am not sure I can fix it unless I have to.

Any advice?

Thanks!

Chris
