Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon E-Brake doesnt hold

Matt,
Is your mechanic also adjusting your rear brakes when he performs the 
surgery or is he just tightening the nut that controls tension on the 
cables themselves?  I would have him tighten the brakes as well since the 
automatic adjusters don't really work as advertised.

&gt; again and wont hold me.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been told that its my e-brake cables  - they are stretched.
&gt; I replaced these once (albeit with *used*, probably also stretched cables)
&gt; and it didnt help.
&gt; 
&gt;   Are there any good solutions for this?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
