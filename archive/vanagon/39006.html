Subject: Re: Cost of restoring '67?

I will have to agree with everyone else.  it really depends on what work 
you do yourself and what you farm out.  the more you can do yourself the 
cheaper the project gets. 

i just finished a full resto on my 60 crew cab.  looking back, if i had 
farmed out all of the work, i would be into it about twice what it is 
worth.  It is alway's better to start with the straightest, dryest bus 
you can.  body and paint add's up quick.  if you can do it yourself, then 
you have cut about $2000 out of your project.  I did that, but i also 
spent the better part of 4 month's working on it. (it was my full time 
job for the summer)  most people can not do that.  If you have ne 
mechanical know-how, and do not intent to learn, then you will be 
spending alot in engine, trany and electrical work.  

i think the bottom line is:
	what do you want to end up with
	What do you want to spend
	how long do you want to wait to get it.

if you want a nice bus, have no time or money; then buy the one you 
want.  if you are into and up for a big adventure, then go for it.  the 
one thing that i enjoy the most is telling people that &quot;I did it all&quot;.  
that to mee is worth alot.  it is my work on my car.  

that is just my opinion though.

take care and God Bless
