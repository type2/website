&gt;Has anyone else looked over the Mercedes V-class website

&gt;Thomas Niksch brought to our attention?  This looks like yet another 
&gt;nice van that won't be available in the US.  Very reminiscent of the 
&gt;Eurovan in appearance.  Have any of the listmembers in Europe been 
&gt;able to drive one of these?

There are a bunch of pictures of Mercedes campers in the 'photos' section
of http://vanagon_dot_com/  (look under 'cousins')
