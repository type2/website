Subject: Re: Highway paint

 
&gt;For a while I have been formulating the possibility of adding the
&gt;little glass spheres that are in highway paint to the paint
&gt;on my bumpers, and mabye even the wheels.
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody have experience with this? Have you ever seen these
&gt;additives in body shops or paint stores? Mabye the sign-painting
&gt;business would be a good place to look....
&gt;
&gt;
I have seen the beads that the highway painters use and I think they may be
the same beads that you use in a glass bead blasting cabinet.
