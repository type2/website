     &gt;&gt; in 1964 the Deluxe no logner has corner windows.  And my '64 which  
     &gt;&gt; is a Deluxe (the kelly blue book says 'Deluxe Wagon' if I go by   
     &gt;&gt; VIN number) does not have corner window (or sunroof or portholes  
     &gt;&gt; - sigh).
     &gt;
     &gt;What *does* it have? Seats? Glass in the Windows? DoeSPOONsn't sound 
     &gt;very deluxe so far ; )
     
     It's an unfortunate quark of options such that you could get the 
     deluxe without what we condsider the best bits.
     
     Fortunately mine has all the best bits :)
