&gt; The best part 
&gt; was that when we are camping, I cook, and Anthony does 
&gt; KP. I can't figure out why it doesn't work this way at 
&gt; home! Does anyone else have this problem when camping

While out in our 82 DIESEL WESTY ( I'm so new here, I didn't even make 
the unknown list), I do all of the cooking, and the drying of implements 
used.  At home, we're on a slightly different schedule so I do my own 
cooking and wait for &quot;someone&quot; to do the dishes.
