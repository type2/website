Subject: Re: Low Comp, Cyc #1 

I would think that it would depend on what the problem was, i.e., perhaps it 
just needs a valve job (my '73 dropped a valve - terminally - in #1).  
Otherwise, why would the rings go on one cylinder only??  Not impossible, 
but how likely?

&gt;Dear VWers,
&gt;
&gt;I measured the compression on my cyclinders as follows:
&gt;
&gt;1- 40, 2- 126, 3-120, 4-130.
&gt;
&gt;Does it make sense to just repair cyl #1? i.e. change the piston, rings,
&gt;valves,... on cyl #1, or one has to do the whole set?
&gt;
&gt;Any information is appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Vahid
&gt;
