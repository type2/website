Subject: Unusal Vanagon version - anyone else see this before? &lt;long&gt;

I was recently going through by bus literature collection again, and found
something I've never seen before.  The particular brochure is for a Caravelle
Carat that appears to be designed as a businessman's express, and has an
interior like no other Vanagon I've seen.  As far as the exterior is
concerned, it shows a grey bus with the usual late-model bumpers and body
side moldings (like the US Carat), which is a little surprising since the
brochure is dated 8/83 (I guess I shouldn't be too surprised at that fact,
since I've got a brochure from '79 that shows this body style in a sketch).
 The other distinguishing characteristics are the rectangular headlights and
alloy wheels with 13 holes around the perimeter.
  The interior is the most unusual part:
-Six bucket seats in 2 x 2 x 2 arrangement, middle pair swivel 180 degrees
-Extra cloth padding on headrests (all 6 seats)
-padded steeting wheel and dashboard
-folding table mounted to sidewall with light (different from US Carat or
Multivan)
-mouldings around windows that include swiveling ball type lights (and light
for table mentioned above)
-molded armrests for rear seats; they start in the luggage area and flow all
the way to the sides of the rear seats and includes lighters, ashtrays,
briefcase storage bins.

  I've looked for information that might tip me off to this being an
aftermarket conversion, but I can't find anything of this nature.  From all
appearances this is a factory VW product, as it doesn't have that
&quot;aftermarket&quot; look (you know what I mean...).  If I can get the scanner
working, I could come up with some B&amp;W scans.

  I'm curious to know if this version ever went into production, how many
were made over what time period, and if these interior parts might be
available somehow (outside of the US, I assume).  

Thanks, 
Ryan
