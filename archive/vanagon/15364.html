Subject: Camping in the Rain

What's the best way to protect the canvas in a Westy top from the rain? 
Pack it up and go home?  Does it need to be kept dry?  I'm told it
shouldn't be put away wet.  Got my first camping trip planned for the
weekend after Easter.  Rain could be in the offing.  Any advice would be
appreciated.  Thanx!
