Subject: Re:  Bozos Bus/ Telefunken Find

Recent references (reefers?) to the Firesign Theater reminds me that myself
and several other list members had the opportunity to burn a few braincells
at a little &quot;public house&quot; in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA that was named &quot;Bozos
Bustop.&quot; It was located right down the road from the Greyhound and Trailways
bus stations during the early to mid 1970's.  At the time it seemed to make
sense to warm the soul and hide from the snowy weather with a cold beer and
a warm woman. Life seems to change. The three bus stops are all gone, the
beer is warm, and the women are cold. ;) Maybe it's just my perception due
to the lost braincells...
Signing off now,

BTW:This morning I noticed a garage sale as I was driving  by Ralph
Sport-sport Motors. At the garage sale I  picked up a Telefunken home radio
that was in bitchen condition for $25.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (for
reals, man!) Had to buy it from the older fellow who had just purchaed it
for $15.00. He siad that he'd make $10.00 and avoid a trip down to the local
park and swap. Glad I could help out. =)
