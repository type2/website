&gt; What I'm interested in knowing is whether it is possible to dispense with
&gt; this part and just hook up a ground strap somewhere else ? What, if any,
&gt; other function does it serve? Thanks for all the advice.

My '86 Syncro Westfalia Vanagon GL does not have any screen ring at/on
the distributor. Should it have; was it optional?
