'85 VAN A/c, very nice shape!
Dean of Kirkwood  966-0303

'84 Camper Westphalia (sic), 5 spd.
Dean of Kirkwood  966-0303

[note: Dean of Kirkwood is a dealer and not cheap. I saw the Westfalia and
it's got a big dent in the left flank, 130,000 miles and a winsdhield
sticker that says New Foundland. interior is fine, though. Both vans have
been advertized in the paper for quite some time already. Area code is
314.]

'71 VW Campmobile, very nice, no rust, runs real nice, $2000/best offer.
314-699-4278 or 314-699-4489.
