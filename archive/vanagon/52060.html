Subject: Freeze plug leaking coolant, what to do?
Date: Thu, 21 Nov 96 20:05:43 EST

One of the freeze plugs has a block heater installed.
That one has started leaking coolant. I tried gently tapping
the block heater more firmly into the freeze plug hole, but
that didn't help. (How hard can I tap/hammer before breaking
something?

Somebody please suggest what I should try next! (Preferrably
something which doesn't require me to drain the cooling
system.)

A note in the archives suggests using JB weld to seal the
plugs in an aircooled block. Would that work here also?
JB weld is just an epoxy right? Can I use PC7 instead?
I also thought about silicone rubber, but wasn't sure if 
that would work when the coolant  is under pressure.

If I drain the system, how do I (nondestructively) get the
block heater out? And what should I do to make it seal
better when I put it back in.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. The cold Nov weather
does not invite to exhaustive experimentation in the
driveway.

Thanks,
Martin and 82 diesel westy
