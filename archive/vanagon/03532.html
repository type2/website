 Hi,

&gt; Please pardon my lack of knowledge, but does this particular diesel
&gt; engine lend itself to being turbo'd?  Other than laying down a cloudbank big
&gt; enough to hide the Bricks Across America convoy, it would seem to have
&gt; practical benefits.  Has anyone tried it?

 Yep, VW have been doing it for years. I don't think many turbodiesels
made it to the USA, though.

Cheers,
        W.
