Subject: RE: what causes burping?

Hi.  Thanks to those who responded to my question.  A new fuel filter
solved the problem.  It turns out that there was a round metal filter
present (I'm not sure why I didn't see it before), but it was the wrong
filter which is maybe why I didn't recognize it.  The previous owner lived
in a part of SC where it seems that nobody had ever heard of a vanagon. 
The VW dealer in terre haute, IN told me that the filter that was in there
wasn't even for a fuel injected system.  I haven't noticed too much
difference since the filter was changed, but the burping stopped and I
made it to the east coast without any problems.  It could be that the gas
I bought was the last straw for the old filter.  Anyway, it's nice to have
the right parts. 
Thanks again for the help...........david (somewhere in the eastern time 
zone)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've been driving my '87 a lot for the last couple of days....left
&gt; &gt;Colorado and now I'm on the road in Indiana.  It's being doing well, but
&gt; &gt;after driving about 450 miles yesterday, I bought some fuel, put some air
&gt; &gt;in the tires and continued for about another 150 miles.  during this last
&gt; &gt;stretch, I experienced little burps most of the way....sometimes a few
&gt; &gt;within one minute, and sometimes a few minutes between burps.  The one
&gt; &gt;things that distinguished my last stop prior to the burping is that I
&gt; &gt;didn't let the engine rest for very long, i.e. it didn't get a chance to
&gt; &gt;cool off.  Often, when I make other gas stops every 250 miles or so, I sit
&gt; &gt;around for 15 minutes.  I don't know if this is relevant.  I also went to
&gt; &gt;a gas station that didn't seem to be getting much business, and I've had
&gt; &gt;problems with old gas in another car before causing the same symptoms. 
&gt; &gt;I've heard about wiring harnesses fixing burping, but what are things can 
&gt; &gt;I check while on the road?  I haven't driven it since last night, and the 
&gt; &gt;problem might be gone, but I wouldnt' mind checking what I can for now.  
&gt; &gt;Is there a way to tell if the magic harness has been installed on mine?  
&gt; &gt;Here's some more info just to confuse matters.  Two days ago in Omaha, 
&gt; &gt;NE, I put in a bottle of techron, but it ran fine after that for those 
&gt; &gt;first 450 miles.  Also, since I've owned my '87, I've been confused by 
&gt; &gt;the fuel filter.  I don't have the big cylinder filter, but I do have one 
&gt; &gt;of those small plastic rectangular filters.  My understanding is that the 
&gt; &gt;vanagons came with 2 filters initially, and the second one I mentioned 
&gt; &gt;was supposed to have been removed at some point leaving only the big 
&gt; &gt;metal cylindrical filter.  Unless I'm looking in the wrong place, I can't 
&gt; &gt;find that one.  I'm gonna try and drive to MD tomorrow, so I'll see if 
&gt; &gt;the burping persists, but any thoughts or advice would be appreciated as 
&gt; &gt;always.    Thanks  -david
