&gt;I am using the 1.9 ECU and distributor. All plumbing was modified for the

&gt;had a similar experience with their motor. 
&gt;Any suggestions?

Tim,
Bring it over.  The problem is all in how you set the timing and mixture.
 Did you also schange the injectors?  The ECU from the 1.9 has a hard time
controlling the idle mixture with the 2.1 injectors.
