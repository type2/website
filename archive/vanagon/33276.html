So Psychic Trucker says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;How bad are they leaking?  Check yourself, do not trust the dealer.
&gt; &gt;If it's minor seepage, you can you a product called BarsLeak to 
&gt; &gt;seal it up.  You just pour it in your expansion tank and run the
&gt; &gt;engine until the thermostat just starts to open.  This should take
&gt; &gt;care of any small leaks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Reference: Dennis Haynes 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I personally would not reccomend pouring barsleak in your expansion tank.
&gt; My heads are leaking and i did that and it just collected on the bottom and
&gt; clogged my valve cap. i poured it out of the expansion tank and put in into
&gt; the main tank and my heads still leak, but not as bad, BUT the majority of
&gt; it could still be on the bottom on my main tank, i will stir it up soon and
&gt; run my engine for 15 min.
&gt; 
&gt; Just unscrew your main tank and pour it in, it's heavy so it will force out
&gt; coolant and sink to the bottom, stir and run your engine.

Well now you-all know what kind of idiot screw-ups I do.  I'm saying the
expansion tank, but I mean the main tank.  DOH!!
