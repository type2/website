Subject: Georgia to New York!

Hi folks!

Peggy and I are going on our maiden voyage of a &quot;new&quot; 84 Westie from
Augusta, GA to Ithaca, NY next weekend.  We were wondering if anyone out
there knows of any good VW repair shops if, knock on wood, we should need
any.  Or, for that matter, any sights or campsites we absolutely cannot
miss.  We would also be grateful of phone numbers of list members along our
route in case we need technical assistance!  We haven't totally settled on
our route yet, except that we're going north!

Thanks!

Eric
