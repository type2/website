Subject: Re: Ground Shut-off Switch Needed

FYI, my &quot;Heidleburg&quot; factory radio has a small white button on its side 
which disables the radio code.  Obviously this defeats this security 
feature, however, in my case, my radio is a pullout.  I always assumed 
that if someone wanted to steal it they wouldn't even know about the code 
until after they took it.

&gt; &gt; Hi All:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am looking for a simple but effective ground shut-off or disconnect
&gt; &gt; switch for my '83 Vanagon. There is not enough room in the battery
&gt; &gt; compartment for an available terminal post screw switch, plus I don't
&gt; &gt; want to be opening and closing the cover all the time.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anybody know of a pull-plug key or other external disconnect? (I
&gt; &gt; seem to remember reading about a VW hot-rod modification for a
&gt; &gt; plastic/metal remote ground connection with a big key, but that was a
&gt; &gt; few years ago)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please reply to the list
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TIA
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a great idea. One complexity would be the radio. Each time
&gt; you reconnected the battery ground key, you would need to reenter the
&gt; radio code number. Perhaps reconnecting the radio to your auxiliary
&gt; battery would be a good idea.
&gt; 
&gt; I've noticed these cut out switches with removable connectors (keys) in
&gt; marine shops (I think it was West Coast Marine).
