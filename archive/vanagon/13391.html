Subject: Autostick trans questions (BUG)
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 95 15:07:22 EST
From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

  For all you bug folks out there, what can anyone tell me about
autostick transmissions? Mainly, are they as bad as the full automatics?
My girlfriend is looking at a really nice '69 bug, but it is autostick.
How do they drive, and shift, etc...? Anyway, thanks
Richard
