&gt; Thank GOD you told me that &lt;grin&gt;. I pulled one of those suckers without 
&gt; thinking and have been sitting here for the last half hour trying to 
&gt; decide how I would know how to put it back.  I can put a meter on it to 
&gt; tell which wire is which, but I don't know how that corresponds to where 
&gt; it goes.  Now I can look at the others without pulling them and getting 
&gt; even more messed up.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; as for the dash lights, you are talking about those little bulbs in the
&gt; &gt; little square white housings, right? those are incandescent bulbs (as i
&gt; &gt; recall) and you have to twist those white housings 90 degrees to remove it.
&gt; &gt; you might be able to replace them with radio shack wheat bulbs.
&gt; 
&gt; Yup, I got them all out, and two are bad and one is good.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; the bentley book doesn't show any fuses in the foil, but a resistor could be
&gt; &gt; bad. if you match ohms and carefully solder it, it should work ok. on my
&gt; &gt; 1980 bus, i added a tach (in place of the clock), and had to solder some
&gt; 
&gt; Gee, a tach would be REAL nice.  I already have a clock in the radio, so
&gt; I'm not sure what the clock is worth.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; connections to the fold. in doing so, i broke the foil in one place, so i
&gt; &gt; soldered a straight piece of wire across the break and it worked ... still
&gt; &gt; working, i guess. i saw the old bus going down the road a couple of days ago.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it isn't a resistor -- I don't want to start soldering on the foil.
&gt; I'd just be asking for more trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all the help.
