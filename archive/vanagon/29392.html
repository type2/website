Subject: Breaks...

Yesterday I attempted to push my frozen brake pistons back into their homes
with a C-clamp.  Well, I have a sprung C-clamp now.  I guess they were more
frozen than I thought.  I ended up splitting the caliper and using a 2-ton
jack and the bus to force the pistons back into their respective caliper
halves.  (You ever have one of those days???) Actually, on one side, the
weight of the bus and the jack wasn't enough to force the piston back in.  I
had to put a 1&quot; socket inside the piston and whack it with a hammer.

Ok, enough fun.  The real question is:  should I even attempt to reuse these
things or would I just be tempting fate?  The rubber boots around the
pistons weren't cracked or anything although one did have a bunch of rust
flakes under it.  It looks like a caliper rebuild kit just includes new
boots and rubber washers.  All of that stuff looked fine it's just that the
pistons are a little difficult.  Of course, now that I just crushed them
under my bus and beat the shit out of them with a hammer I'm a little
concerned about safety! ;)

As always, any input would be appreciated.

Bob.
