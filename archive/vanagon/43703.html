Subject: RE: Type 2 Engine Mount


&gt;I have just recently become the
&gt;co-owner of a 71 Westfalia Bus.  The engine is in good condition but one of
&gt;the bolts from the rear engine mount on the drivers side has broken out,
&gt;taking a small chunk of the block with it.  Talking with the local mechanic
&gt;I was told there is a kit you can buy to mount the engine from the four
&gt;bolts on  the oil pump.  Does anyone know what this kit is called, and 
where
&gt;it might be available?  Any help would be appreciated.


This often called a &quot;Busmount Engine Adaptor&quot;, used to mount engines that
don't have the rear case mounts, into a 68-71 bus that requires them.
Thy are available from many VW specialty houses, such as Johnny's Speed
and Chrome and others. Have a look at the ads in Hot VWs magazine,
available in most grocery stores and bookstores.

Paradoxically, the case mounts you have on your engine (the ones that
haven't broken off, anyway), may get in the way of your using this
adaptor. It might be possible to saw off the adaptor's lugs where your
engine still has good mounting points, and use only the one adaptor lug
where your case mount is broken. Anyone tried this?
