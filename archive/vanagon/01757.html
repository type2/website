Subject: Re: Bike Rack for a Bus


As far as the front-back-top bike rack issue. One thing to remember on
rear-mounted racks is to insure that the exaust is far away from the
tires of the bike. I learned this the hard way. &lt;g&gt; It's amazing what a
constant blast of hot exaust will do to a bike tire over a couple of hundred
mile trip...
