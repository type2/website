Subject: While we're on the subject of front glass :(

Y'know I moved outa L.A. to get away from this kinda thing.  Seems like I was
part of a vandal party along the semi-rural road I live on east of Redding
last night or early this morning.  About 15 cars (including my 80 Wanagon
became victims of &quot;rockus maximus&quot;.  I have a beautifully caved in
windshield.  Cost to fix $195 and that's without the glass shop providing the
seal (Of course I have 'em, but they ain't cheap to get from Der Fatherland,
even at my cost).  Last year I went thru 4 mailboxes (Sheriff's finally
caught 'em).  Now if they touch my newly acquired 84 Westy.....well I'm not
responsible for my actions if I catch 'em.

OH Well....Another Monday :|
