Subject: NJ LAW


 The NJ law was passed pretty quietly, the good points were the only ones 
let out, and even they were presented in small articles.  I don't believe 
this law will amount to anything, esp when the masses (most of which own 
old cars) find out the nitty gritty.  The other thing with it is that it 
was supposed to start last summer, but the state bozos couldn't get the 
machines to test accurately and few garages could afford to pay for 
the machines in order to do the necessary repair work on failed cars.  As 
the delay continues it is attracting more attention, which I according to 
my discussions with mechanics and other cars owners is causing a lot of 
negative hoopla. Which could cause politicians, who suddenly feel getting rid 
of it is the way to a future job, to change it.  We all know how quickly they 
like to change their minds.
