&gt;Just a reminder... You can get a copy of this ad from VoA by calling 
&gt;their 800 number and asking for it.  They will ask a couple of questions 
&gt;and send it out in about 1.5-2 weeks.  (I suppose that this is subject to 
&gt;availablity - I got mine about 2 months ago.)  The number is 
&gt;1-800-444-8987.

     Perhaps.  I called them in November, around Thanksgiving, answered 
their questions, and.....

	Received the video tape in December. (haven't looked at it yet)
	have NOT received the Jerry Garcia poster (yet)

I know it's a freebie so I shouldn't complain, but the nice lady said she 
would send it.  I am still waiting.
