&gt; I have a 90 vanagon, which is having a funny problem.  Once in a
&gt; while, while I am stopped for a while (such as at a traffic light),
&gt; the van jerks just slightly -- as if I had taken my foot off the
&gt; brake and then re-applied it, but faster than what I could do myself.
&gt;  It also, occasionally, feels temporarily 'stuck' when I start up
&gt; again from a light.  I'll be sitting at a red light, foot on the
&gt; brake, and when the light turns green, apply the accelerator, and
&gt; then it takes just a few seconds before the car moves at all -- as if
&gt; it were sitting on something sticky and had to break free.  Neither
&gt; of these things happens with any consistency -- it's once or twice,
&gt; every few days.  I'm concerned of course, that it might be the start
&gt; of something serious, especially since I have a hunch it may involve
&gt; the brakes.  Can anyone give me any insights?

I think your hunch is correct.  It seems that your rear (drum) brakes
are binding and dragging. This would explain the small lurch after
braking to a stop (dragging brake reacting to stress when stopped) and
the reluctance to move after being stopped.

To test this supposition, after driving a mile or so (with minor brake
application) put your hand on the brake drum and feel if it is warm/hot.
