You ought to be able to find a pad at a junkyard, that's where I found mine.

&gt;Also, I wanted to find a fire extinguisher that would fit in the holder 
&gt;next to the sliding door.  Mine wasn't there when I bought the van.
&gt;I would appriciate any help.

Go to WalMart or whatever and buy a new fire extinguisher. They all seem to
use similar brackets (and they come with new brackets as well). Make sure
you get an extinguisher that is approved for automobile use (Type BC).
