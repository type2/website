Subject: Re: Cool Transporter Picture


&gt; Hi all: I was just thumbing through the new VW Trends (march 97) and on
&gt; page 81 there is a picture of a three door Transporter all painted up
&gt; for Rallye use. The article is about the cars in the VW museum. I would
&gt; like to see a clearer shot of the transporter and it's history would be
&gt; interesting.   Todd Francis

Look closer - it's not a Transporter, or at least not what we're used 
to seeing. I read an article about this truck being done for Yamaha 
as a motor cycle crew truck in a rallye. It's based on the larger 
commercial VW truck, but I do not know the name of it. One of the 
list members posted a link to a vw page showing more details a while 
back. Apparently the engine is mid mounted between/behind the front 
seats. That's about all I know...
