&gt;&gt; Concerning head temps:  You might ask Sami about his setup.  I seem to
&gt;&gt; remember him saying that he had a sensor on #3 and #1, with a switch 
&gt;&gt; at the gauge.  I wonder what his readings are.  I think his bus is a 
&gt;&gt; '73.  I read this list too closely sometimes.  Jim
&gt;
&gt;Sami's bus is a 75, fuel-injected 1.8 with Volvo seats.  :)

Ahem, thanks David for bringing up this very essential detail. :)

Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for the 15' wire that goes from the
thermo sender to the dash. So it isn't hooked up yet. But I'll keep you
posted.
