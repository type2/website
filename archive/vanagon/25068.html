	All right, you can all stop laughing now. :)
 
	Being in Iowa, I can honestly say I'll never see another
synchro in my life.  How do they get power from the transmission
to the center diff?
 
	I need to figure out how the power is transmitted.  Given enough
time, I can build something for the suspension.  But, despite my
craftiness with the welder and mill, and my frightening knowledge of
vehicle dynamics, I just don't think I can build a transmission.
 
	Someday I want to have a 4wd Breadloaf.  Some ignent sould
asked me if my Van was 4wd last winter.  I almost died laughing.
I've been driving it of road more and more and determined that I need
to get my muffler out of the way.  Its getting the crap banged out of it.
 
	Also, does ZF make a locking diff that can be used in the
supreme vehicle of all time or would I be better off canibalizing
an entire drivetrain off something and sticking it under a breadloaf
or splittle body??

	REsume laughing.....

Matt
