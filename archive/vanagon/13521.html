Subject: Re: HELP advise on purchase of '70 camper

&gt;With a bad sliding door and steering box, this van is not worth $1000.00.
&gt;The rust you mentioned probably means more extensive rust elsewhere.  When
&gt;you go look at the van, lie underneath it and check out every square foot
&gt;of the undersides and wheel wells.  Poke around with a screwdriver, and
&gt;take a long careful time.

CAUTION:  Wear eye protection if you're under the van poking
          around for rusty spots!
