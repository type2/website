Subject: To the SCUM that stole my semaphores!!

	I've been advised to worry about someone stealing the gates from
my 70 single cab, since they're basicly in like-new condition. Allen key'ed
screws, ground-down to be cone-shaped like the flat-head screws they'd 
replace, might work. But I feel the superior solution is to use a very
long screw in a couple of locations for each gate, with a hole drilled
through the threaded parts of the screw and a little lock or a cotter pin
(or castleated nut &amp; cotter pin) could be attached in the under-bed space.

	For semaphores, allen headed screws and loc-tite (good, but not
the stuff that needs heat to break it...) might be a start. 

	What a low-life thing to do, stealing someone's old VW parts. 

	Bill
