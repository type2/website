So kdbarthl_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; Have recently been reconnected to University e-mail.  It is becoming 
&gt; difficult to handle amount of mail coming from vanagon list.  Don't want 
&gt; to unsubscribe.  What options are there for managing volume of mail?  
&gt; 

Tell your system administrator at the University that all non-VW related
data is irrelavent and that only VW data is to be allowed in.  Filter
out the rest.  Resistance is futile!  :)

Or.... you can change to digest mode...
