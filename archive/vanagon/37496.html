&gt;Here is my situation, hopefully I can get some insight from some other 
&gt;members.  I have a dying engine in my '85, as well as a stuffed-up cat 
&gt;(converter, not pet.)  As we all know, I'm looking at big bucks here - 
&gt;Please no flames from the aircoolies.
&gt;
&gt;$2400 Longblock
&gt;$750 Labor
&gt;$800 Cat. Convert.
&gt;------------------
&gt;$3950 (plus other extras probably)
&gt;
&gt;Which option do I take.
&gt;
&gt;A) KEP Subaru Conversion Kit, (if it ever passes emissions)
&gt;
&gt;B)Above New Parts Route
&gt;
&gt;C) Used Complete 2.1 from newer vanagon/with full exhaust system, FI 
&gt;system
&gt;
&gt;D) Sell for parts, use money to create &quot;I was waterfooled&quot; foundation, 
&gt;serving the interest of prospective wasserboxer owners.
&gt;
&gt;
GOOD GOD, MAN!

Are you satisfied that this is the lowest price around by a competant shop?
 I work at a dedicated VW Audi repair shop in SC and we can turn your beast
around for less than half that and that includes a new universal 3way cat
installed!  Get a grip on yourself.   Don't go to the biggest ad in the
yellow pages!  Go to the one that is small and has &quot;VW Specialists&quot; in the
ad.  Don't pay those prices!  Worst case, I ship you my Vanagon tow bar and
you drag the poor beast HERE for a reasonably priced overhaul.
