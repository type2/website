&gt; Put in a flush tee.  I found a GREAT place to put it in, and I don't know 
&gt; if it was because someone had already done this, or because it's in the 
&gt; design, but in the hose that goes to the heater under the front of the 
&gt; car, there was already a plastic fitting continuing the pipe.  Drop the 
&gt; spare and look up where the shift box is and you can see if yours is the 
&gt; same.  If so, you can just let the coolant out of the back until it 
&gt; stops, and pull that fitting apart and put the tee in instead.  Then when 
&gt; you are done, you can put the regular fitting back.  I stayed clean 
&gt; through the entire procedure, so it wasn't so bad.

OK you've convinced me, I'll see if there is a plastic fitting I can
temporarily replace.

&gt; &gt; Also, when the coolant is drained, do you just let it drain onto your
&gt; &gt; driveway and into the environment?
&gt; 
&gt; Nope.  I caught amost all of mine in an oil drain pan and recycled
it.

Did you recycle it back into the engine? Or was it recycled at your
local recycle center?

I thought the purpose of flushing the coolant was to clear out the
scum and introduce *fresh* coolant with the chemical additives at
their highest. (Sorta like changing oil after 3k miles).

So, this bears the question... Should the coolant be replaced with
fresh stuff? Or, filter and recycle back into the engine. (I've
already bought new coolant so I'm changing it anyway).
