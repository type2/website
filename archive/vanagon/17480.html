Subject: Installing swivel seats in '73 Bus

I very much want to install swivel seats in my '73 Bus.  Is there a
particular seat that I could look for in a junk yard that would [possible
bolt down so I wouldn't have to do any welding?  Are there any other
possibilities that would work?  Also, how involved would it be to cut the
metal off behind the seat?  

If anyone has ever attempted this before or has any help to lend or light to
shed, please let me know.  I plan to get started either tomorrow of Suday if
possible as I'll be living in my bus on Monday and I want to get everything
set before then.

Thanks much in advance to anyone who can help!! ;-)

Peace,

Mark
