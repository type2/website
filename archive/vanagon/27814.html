Subject: 3/4&quot; Socket set

Well... the socket set that Harbor Freight had for $46 is noe $39.99.  If 
you by another $10.01 in stuff you don't pay the shipping.
I have this set and I think it's well worth the $40 if you do a lot of 
hobby car work.  it has a 17&quot; ratchet, 18&quot; sliding T-bar, 4&quot; and 8&quot; 
extensions, 16 12pt sockets, and a case.

The numbers for the set is:
SAE (3/4&quot;-2&quot;): 03995-0RKA
Metric (16-50mm): 05494-0RKA

I don't work for them or anything... just seem like a good deal.

Bradley
