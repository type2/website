Volks,
87GL died today while driving under full electrical load: All lights,
radio and A/C full cold. Would not start immediately, but later would
and drove it home. Now foll items apparently out: A/C: headlights
(dashlights work)/.
Batt shows 12.48V when van off:
Batt shows 13.28V when van on.
Stereo and driving lights work, where to start.
Any tips appreciated
