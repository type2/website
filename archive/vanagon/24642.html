Before these people get bashed all to hell, I'd like to
interject a little in their favor.  Over the last 10
years I or my family have ordered, Bus, Vanagon, Passat,
Jetta, Rabbit, and Quantum Syncro parts from these people.
They have always saved me considerable money compared to
dealer prices.  On the incredibly rare center muffler for
the 4wd Quantum they saved $200+ on an OEM Leistritz part.
Similarly they hunted down a power steering pump for our
'86 vanagon used for less than half dealer price.  They are
quite reasonable on OEM tune-up items and OEM filters etc.
They do not sell junk as a rule.
However in the interest of the people having difficulty with
them, yes they have screwed up my orders innumeable times,
even if you make them read it back carefully, etc. etc.
Never have I had a problem rectifying the issue though, a
simple call back and they exchange for correct parts, sometimes
I pay shipping back, sometimes they do, and they will usually
ship the correct part free if you hassle em since it was their
mistake.  HOWEVER AS WITH ANY MAIL ORDER COMPANY I HAVE ALWAYS
USED PLASTIC FOR THE ADDED INSURANCE THAT THEY WILL DEAL WITH
MY VISA COMPANY NOT ME IF AN UNRECTIFIED MISTAKE OCCURS.
I still strongly reccommend the company without reservation
but suggest that the mail order buyer beware.  Always use a
credit card.  Have the order read back to you with prices and
make sure they verify that they have the stuff in stock.  You
should have no problems and if you do they should be solved
quickly and easily.
This said I just ordered a couple of clutch and accelerator cables
from em last Friday, to make me eat crow, I'll probably get Bug
parts.  We'll see.
