So Jack Reed says:
&gt; I was reading rec.autos.vw the other day and came across the FAQ.  I 
&gt; tried posting to the author (sjohnson_at_ornews.intel_dot_com) and the server 
&gt; bounced the message back to me saying that the address was invalid.  
&gt; Anyone know the correct address and author?
&gt; Thanks for the help.
&gt; Jack

Huh?  What??  I'm on??  

Oh, yeah, ahem...Well, I'm more the administrator and the author(s) our
many and you can find the specific authors within the FAQ itself.  I ended
up with the air-cooled FAQs because the original administrator/author
Paul 'Fred the Ranger' H----  don't have the last name available, got
too busy to post the FAQs regularly, so he passed this fun job to me. :)
Do you want to take it over??  Huh?  Be my guest!  Oh well, let me
know if you do.  

Oh the address you saw at the top was the server that my news operates
through and not my address.  My address is: sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com

BTW, this is the FAQ for air-cooled VWs and NOT for the vanagon mailing
list. 

So there you have it.

Cheers!
