Subject: Re: Propane for BBQ for Westy

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if the fill-up nozzle on Westy propane tanks will release
&gt; gas as well as take it in? The reason I ask is that I have tried to hook
&gt; up the portable BBQ  with a ten foot hose but have been unable to get a
&gt; flame. The fittings are identical.
&gt; It would be convenient to be able to use the tank for running the BBQ and
&gt; not have to carry an additional source of fuel while travelling.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks - DC

I was able to do this on my 83-VANAGON wihtout any problems. Unless it varies with diff. models, YES,
you should be able to do what you are doing!
