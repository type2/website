Subject: Re: Bus-Boys &quot;Albatross&quot; beam adjusters


&gt;Has anyone fitted the Bus-Boys &quot;Albatross&quot; front beam
&gt;adjusters to a bus before ? I want to fit them to mine
&gt;but just wondered if there were any pitfalls to be had.

Yaeh, they make a big whole in your wallet :-)

Seriously, a mate of mine fitted some and it wasn't easy. I don't know 
exactly how you install them but he mentioned something about having to TIG 
weld them in. Just cutting and turning the beam is even harder. I know of a 
cheap (free) way of making an adjustable beam, but its definitely not easy. 
It's too complicated to explain here without serious finger strain but I can 
give you the full SP if I make it to Slough at the weekend.
