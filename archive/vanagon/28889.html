Subject: Interstate Batteries Researched &amp; Purchased

Consumer Reports has tested auto batteries twice in the last ten years. The
first time, they pronouncnced Interstate the best battery. In a test
published in the last few months, Sears came out on top. The latest test,
however, included very few batteries and in my opinion was quite poor. 

Nevertheless, I called Sears the other day and asked about their Group 41
size, the size that fits in the Vanagon. They said they didn't have a Gold
version of 41 and that if I wanted a 41 I had to settle for their &quot;ordinary&quot;
Diehard.

Meanwhile, I went to a tire shop to buy a tire and I noticed a stack of
Interstate batteries. I looked in their applacation guide and I noticed that
they had *two* 41s, a regular one and a &quot;MagaTron,&quot; or what seems to be
their version of Sear's Gold battery. Looking in their application guide,
however, turned up another possibility, their MB 66-60, otherwise specified
as the MT91. 

The MagaTron 41 had 650 CCA and 110 mins of reserve capacity whereas the
MT91 had 700 CCA and 115 mins of reserve capacity. The 91 is slightly
different in dimension, being a hair taller, which makes the fit difficult
but not impossible.

I purchased the 91.

If I had to do this again, I think I would purchase the Optima, which I
believe fits in the tray (needs confirmation) and puts out 800 CCA and has
120 mins reserve capacity. The Optima is a sort of exotic design that is
supposed to charge up faster, be more able to withstand deep discharges, and
can be mounted upside down. Its popular in the 4x4 community. 

This discussion applies to the regular automotive battery for the Vanagon.
For the drivers side I use a Group 27 size Exide combination deep cycle
starting battery, their *lower* grade battery cause the higher grade battery
doesn't fit. So far as I know/believe, this exide is among the few large 12
volt marine batteries that will fit in the tray behind the driver. but it
still sticks up a little and the tray must be modified a little. Also, I
think you need the swivel base for the driver or it won't fit.
