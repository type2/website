Subject: New Body Work Toy

I bought myself a new toy last night and gave it a try today after 
work.  AIR NIBBLER.  Best $50 I could spend.  I cut a driver side 
rocker off a bus that is going to the crusher in about 30 minutes.  

This really works great.  It is basically a punch in a sleeve and 
it cuts FAST with NO DISTORTION!  My new favorite tool!  Get one 
for yourself, you'll be glad you did.

Dave
