&gt;&gt;Ralf and Jim work on their buses,
&gt;&gt;Wearing panties and a braaaaar,
&gt;&gt;Neither one of them has much money,
&gt;&gt;so their clothes are be-low par.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Mike went camping in the mountains
&gt;&gt;Where the 4 by 4's do roam.
&gt;&gt;Viscious critters ate his brake lines,
&gt;&gt;Had to drag a log back home.
&gt;
&gt;Ric's had dozen veedubs or more
&gt;And 4 or 5 still on Mars
&gt;Suprised his wallets' not more sore,
&gt;&gt;From all those little cars.

how about:
Ric has had two dozen veedubs,
Maybe more, we're not quite sure.
But he's lost all of his money ...
Wives and Cars are quite a 'cure'.

and, from the still fertile mind (well, b.s. IS a fertilizer!)
Johnny Gladu and his Bozobus
Had a Honda on the roof.
People thought it was a Greyhound
(or he'd been drinking 90 proof!).

&gt;I *wish* it was Friday now.  I can hear my bus a-callin'.

amen. hmmmm. Folsom Prison Blues ...

I hear my bus a-callin,
Callin out for me,
Wanting to go riding,
Wanting to go see

but i'm stuck here in this office,
watching time go by ...
when i see those buses riding,
i hang my head and cry.

:)

&lt;only two more days til Friday!&gt;
