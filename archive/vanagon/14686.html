Subject: GAS HEATER



I have one gas heater and one problem.  Good news first, I have
a Stewart-Warner gas heater for a bus model #8332.  When I got
it it didn't work at all.  The combustion air/fuel pump motor
was frozen up and there was rust most everywhere.  Well
now the only thin wrong with it is that the nozzle is
blocked, but it is only a $20 part that is still available.
I reconditioned the whole thing, sandblasted the frame, 
got the frozen motor to run, replaced the blower motor, 
fixed all the electrical connections, and cleaned everything
up really good.  It would work right at this moment but the 
nozzle.  To think of the condition that I found it, in an
old leaky shed on the ground frozen in a puddle.  True story.

Well here comes my problem.  I don't have a bus!  Just a
bug, and I got a 6v German heater from the same place for that.
I have two options to remedy this delema:
	1.  Buy a bus.  Not a bad idea.  Anyone got a 
solid split windshield w/o engine in Downeast Maine?
No?  
	2.  Sell the unit.  Good idea!  I have an
engine rebuild to finance.  Anyone interested?  Remember, 
it works!

Send all offers for buses and the heater to my E-mail 
as I subscribed only to write this message.
