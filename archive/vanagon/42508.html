Subject: Yellow striped modulator

 To all: I'm still in need of modulator for '73 automatic tranny
on type2 van. This is the vacuum connection on the transmission.
 The part number as relayed to me by local VW dealer is 003-325-391.
This is another part VW doesn't handle any more so I will accept any
thing that works. Anyone, anywhere?     thanks     west
