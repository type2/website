Subject: Re: Adding 2nd battery to Westfalia

&gt;What's the process for adding a 2nd battery to an '87 Westfalia to power
&gt;auxilliary stuff such as interior lights and fridge? Are they already wired
&gt;for this?

it is pretty straight-forward. there is a space under the drivers seat, not
as big as the other battery compartment. You need to wire in a specific
fuse box and limiter, and there is some prewiring already. I had this done
in Phoenix, but anybody who knows Westys should be able to do it, if not
yourself. The main thing is to protect the main battery from discharging on
aux, and the aux battery from overcharging when you are on the road
