Subject: re:Catalytic Heaters

All,

This is primarily directed at those who have propane heaters (catalytic
or otherwise in their busses/campers), but anyone with info please feel
free, in fact I encourage you, to respond

I got my camping world catalog today. The past week saw some cold(for
Texas) temps, and my desire for some sort of auxilliary heat source for
camping and what not was revived.  What amount of BTU's are needed to
heat a camper, with not extra insulation.  I'm only after a 20* - 30*F
increase in temp. ie when it is 45*f outside, I would like it to be
about + - 65*f inside. Just enough to take the chill off the air, and
make it comfortable.  Due to cost considerations, I would be getting a
new catalytic heater, or if I could find one used at a reasonable price,
I would get a furnace type heater.  As I don't anticipate doing a winter
camping (at least not with my wife, as she says, wintertime is not
camping time).  I am used to sleeping on the ground in a tent with snow
on the ground, if I do camp in the winter, I wont mind not being able to
reach 60*f, so a powerful heater will be overkill.  We also have the
ceramic type heaters, if we have AC hookups, but I don't necessarily
want to camp in RV campgrounds all the time.

One last thing, where do you mount the catalytic type heaters.  If I get
a furnace type, I will try to fit it in the spare tire cubby, since the
spare will be going on the front of the bus, but I imagine that a
catalytic heater would not fare too well in that cramped spot, so where
to mount it?

Cheers,

David
