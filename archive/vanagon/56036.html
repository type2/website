Subject: VW Design Radio &amp; Blower Motors

We can add the Porche 924 to the list of blower motors for the vanagon
front fan. (If it wasn't on the list already.) Pulled one from the
friendly local junk yard. I want that engine for my Syncro :-) 
	For anyone interested, the guy has a VW Design Am/Fm cassette radio for
sale. He wants $100 and I have it in my possession to make sure it works
ok. I don't have any monetery interest in the radio. The guy is a friend
of mine and he always gives me a good deal. (Like the $5.00 I payed for
the fan motor!!!) So if anyone is interested E-Mail me. The price
includes shipping and he takes Visa/MC ect.

Erik
87' Syncro

Ps: He also has a couple of Audi Quattros, no vanagons though
