Subject: Possible Solutions

I'm looking to see if anyone has corrected any of the following problems with
their Vanagon; I have an '84 water-cooled Camper.

1. The front seats are rather uncomfortable on long trips, i.e, their seats
seem to short and hard, and the passenger often develops back discomfort
withing a few hours. Has anyone found an elegant solution, or found a certain
type of seat that fits well in this vehicle?

2. I have A/C which seems to only hold a charge for a week or two. Originally
I found what I thought was the problem, which was a leaky Schrader valve on
the compressor, which I replaced. But the problem was more than that. A few
service places have been unable to find the &quot;leak&quot;. Any ideas?
