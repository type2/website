Yes .. There are mexican '97 beetle convertible.  my wife has a 97 hardtop and
is changing for a convertible now.  Is not the same as the old beetle convertible
I'll try to take a picture and put it on the web for those who are interested in this
rare thing.
BTW Mexican beetle has a great engine 1.6i catalitic .. very fast and reliable.
The interior is about the same .. just some touch of modernity .. If someone
is interested i can take some pictures of the interior.

Now there are a bug invation here .. because you can buy a new convertible
for less than us$ 8k

hmmm.....a '97 beetle conv???   I dunno about that...
As far as i know the only mexican made bugs were hardtops, and the last bug
conv. was made by Karmann in Germany in early '80....

maybe someone made the bug into a conv. with a top frame off a junked '70's
bug conv??
highly  possible..with a welder, you can do anything...  :&lt;)

anybody else know??
