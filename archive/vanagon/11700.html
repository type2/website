Subject: Official song of my bus!



My Sunshine gave me a CD for Valentine's Day.

Something like the Best of the Who.

It was in her CD player and queued to song 3.  In presenting it to
me, she hit 'play'.  

It was &quot;Magic Bus&quot;!  And man, does it fit:-)  I'd swear its about my '66!
I suggest all to run out and get it.

...Markus
