&gt;&gt; I am also considering to tighten all head bolts to see if it can cure it.
&gt;&gt; Is this a good idea?
&gt;
&gt;NO!!! go with the first plan, tightening the head bolts after the leak=20
&gt;has already found a path won't stop the leak.  Tightening the head bolts=20
&gt;will very likely allow your heads to warp badly (especially with the=20
&gt;higher temps associated with the coolant prob.)
&gt;Don't do it!

Why should you not try to tighten the head bolts first? If the leaking is=20
due to loosened bolts, you can cure the problem with tightening. While doing=

this, you should pay more attention to high temperature of the coolant and=

strictly avoid high temps.
