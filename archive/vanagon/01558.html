&gt;         Is this an address for getting info about a Vanagon newsletter or
&gt;         something along that line?
&gt; 

Um, no, I believe it's a place for singing songs about VWs and bellyaching 
about high-priced network service providers.  Occasionally an &quot;expert
system&quot; running in Alabama spews forth articles, service bulletins,
pages from repair manuals, etc.  This nefarious beast tries to keep
tabs on all the vans on the mailing list.  He knows about most of them,
DO NOT SUCCUMB!
