Subject:      Re: Flopping mirrors - Vanagon

I learned. I took mine off and tightened the bolt and voila! no more
flopping...for some reason the things remind me of elephant ears

&gt;&gt;With all this talk about fixing those Vanagon mirrors, I suspect
you may
not realize how inexpensive they are to simply replace.  Why mess
with hose
clamps and such?  Remove the mirror, and CAREFULLY tighten the nut
under
the mount.  One of three things will happen.

a)  The problem goes away.  You just saved twenty bucks.
b)  The problem goes away for a couple of months and then returns.
Order a
brand new German mirror for $19.95 plus postage.
c)  The bolt shears when you try to tighten it.  Be careful changing
lanes
until your new mirror arrives.  :-)
