    Just what the header said. It has 48000 miles on it, and it is rough.
The gas heater can be coaxed into working, and there are a few problems
with it that keep it from the road right now, like bad brakes and a broken
shift coupler, but it has been reliable, otherwise. Extra 6v. lights
included!
Write for more info...
