&gt;
&gt;&gt;Forget the idea of using two 6-volt batteries in series.  Dodge
&gt;&gt;tried it years ago and abandoned the idea as impractical.  The
&gt;&gt;problem is, no two batteries are identical, there will always be
&gt;&gt;a slight current flow between them unless they are physically
&gt;&gt;isolated (knife switch, etc) or you use expensive high-amperage,
&gt;&gt;low-loss diodes.  Parallel works fine, although it's best to jack
&gt;&gt;up your alternator output to about 15.6vdc vs the normal 13.8 to
&gt;&gt;overcome the voltage drop in the battery isolator/splitter. 
&gt;&gt;(Which you need because of the problem mentioned above.)  You'll
&gt;&gt;also find it convenient to wire certain accessories to one batt,
&gt;&gt;keeping the other for engine-starting.  A simple battery cut-off
&gt;&gt;switch will allow you to switch from one to the other should you
&gt;&gt;need the accessory battery for starting the engine.
&gt;
&gt;I think you've got it back-asswards, Bob.  Series means they are connected only
&gt;at one point - one battery's (+) terminal to the other battery's (-) terminal. 
&gt;The remaining, unconnected (+) terminal becomes a 12V potential relative to the
&gt;unconnected (-) terminal.  The two terminals with 12V between them are
connected
&gt;to the bus's 12V system and voila', you have a 12V deep cycle battery. 
&gt;Parallel, on the other hand, is how you connect batteries when doing a jump
&gt;start, (+) to (+) and (-) to (-).  This is also how the (12V) accessory battery
&gt;for the 'fridge is connected to the (12V) starter battery, except that there is
&gt;an isolation diode or relay between the two batteries to make sure the 'fridge
&gt;only pulls power from the accessory battery, leaving the other battery fully
&gt;charged to start the car in the morning.  When connecting batteries in
parallel,
&gt;they MUST be (+) to (+) and (-) to (-) and of the same voltage rating (e.g. 12V
&gt;to 12V), unless you want to destroy (with possible explosive force), one or
both
&gt;batteries.  
&gt;
&gt;Best wishes and kind thoughts,

I dis-agree, Bob has it right about batteries in series.  He also has it
right about the voltage drop across an iso unit as I can attest.  I just
installed one when I put the second battery in and my voltage has dropped
from 14.5 to 13.4-8.  I am not particularly concerned about this but it is
interesting.
