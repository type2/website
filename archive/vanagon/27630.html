Subject: Head gasket sealant

Hello, fellow Vanagon owners.

I am having trouble locating VW part #D 000 400 01 which is the head gasket
sealant for the water cooled engine. I blew the head gasket on my 1984 van
recently and am ready to put everything back together, except my local dealer
says that there is a backorder on this item for all of the USA and Canada. I
have heard horror stories about those who have used other sealants for this
purpose, so I need to know if anyone knows where I may locate it or knows of
a replacement product that you know will work.
BTW, I called VW customer service and was told the same thing; I asked when
it might be available, and they didn't know. They took my number and offered
to call me back when they found out, but I have yet to hear back. They also
refused to recommend a non- VW product.
Can anyone out there help me out?
