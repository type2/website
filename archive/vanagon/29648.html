Subject: From the Mudflap Thread, Westy Questions


First off, I had no problem accessing the site.

Just a few short questions about the Westy that I thought were peculiar.

By the hookups on the drivers side, I noticed the center hook up that is 
typically the 115V electric hookup is dropped almost to the bottom of the 
body panel.  Is this to cover the CSA code, rather than the NEC code in the 
states?  Is this unique to Canada?

What function does the black rectangular box over the rear marker light 
serve on the passenger side of the vehicle?

Just curious for VW trivia.
