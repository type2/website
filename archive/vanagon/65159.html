Subject:      Fender lip rubber prices/customs charges

Friends,

I sent the following to Helmut, but his mail back to
me is garbled, and I am not sure he received this. I'm
posting it to all since it is a matter of general interest,
anyway.

Derek earlier raised the point of shipping by surface mail to avoid
all US customs charges (hopefully). It would be fine with me, though
it would be slower, it is a little more work on the European end,
less work here.

&gt;The price is as shown:
&gt;
&gt;fender lips (3 kg)    DM 320.00   $ 177.78
&gt;chrome      (3 kg)    DM 220.00   $ 122,22
&gt;Shipping to US per kg DM   5.50   $   3,06
&gt;Paperwork total       DM  45.00   $  25,00
&gt;Customs US total appx.            $ 150.00
&gt;Shipping in US                    $   7.50
&gt;
&gt;As an example, one fender lip set will cost $ 335.00 when 10 persons
&gt;will order one set. Chrome will be $ 280.00 in total. I guess it's
&gt;right when dividing the fixed costs by number of persons.

&gt;Helmut, I am confused about your estimates. If there were ten orders for
&gt;the fender lips, I would figure:
&gt;
&gt;Fender lips:$178, plus shipping to US  (3Kx$3) $12, plus German paperwork
&gt;($25/10)$2.50 for a total to Martha of $192.50 or so.
&gt;
&gt;Here in the US, the estimated customs and brokerage charges would be:
&gt;Fees and charges (paperwork) $150/10=$15, plus duty(3% of $195) $6,
&gt;plus shipping $7.50, so a total of  $28.50 which would be reimbursed to me.
&gt;
&gt;$192.50+28.50=$221.00. Actually, we know these are all estimates
&gt;but you get the idea. Where are my calculations wrong?
