Subject: Propane for BBQ for Westy
Date: Wed, 28 Jun 95 8:39:08 EDT



Does anyone know if the fill-up nozzle on Westy propane tanks will release
gas as well as take it in? The reason I ask is that I have tried to hook
up the portable BBQ  with a ten foot hose but have been unable to get a
flame. The fittings are identical.
It would be convenient to be able to use the tank for running the BBQ and
not have to carry an additional source of fuel while travelling.


Thanks - DC
