&gt; &gt; Why the nastiness about this issue I have no idea.
&gt; 
&gt; I started this flame war. I knew it would cause a little controversy. It 
&gt; was only supposed to be a joke. I thought this group needed a little 
&gt; energy pumped into it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now we have people calling each other names and I'm getting threatening 
&gt; e-mail. I repeat. It was only supposed to be a joke.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to say publicly that I'm very sorry I started this. It's grown 
&gt; much larger than I thought it would/should.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the last I'll say on this subject.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
I would like to let everyone know that Mr Kirk did NOT receive ANY 
threatening mail from ME.  That is not my style, after all I pushed for 
respect of all people's views, given that they don't hurt anyone else.  I 
also want to apologize for the extent of this discussion, flame wars 
don't promote discussion.  Like I mentioned to some of you privately, I 
like my old VWs and came here looking for information and discussion of 
them, but I believe that some things are more important and challenging 
hurtful attitudes is mort important.  I too hope to get back to the VW 
discussion here, but as ever, I welcome mature comments to my personal 
e-mail.  LET THE VWing BEGIN!
peace to ALL!
