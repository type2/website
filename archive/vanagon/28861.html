Subject: tourist stops, CO to MD

     
     hey gang -
     
     I'm going to drive the bus from Denver CO to Maryland for 
     thanksgiving, leaving sometime later this week.  I haven't decided 
     whether to use I-70 or further south.
     
     I thought I'd query the group about recommendations for places to stop 
     - either camping, interest sites (museums etc) or shopping (jc whipme, 
     etc) that I would find along the way.  I'll have ham radio working 40 
     and 20 meters (and 80 once I get another whip).
     
     If anyone along these routes want to hang and have a beer I'm open to 
     working that in too.
     
     thanks much, happy motoring
     
     john clark
