Subject: '87 Syncro brake failure?


Hi all, 

Scenario:
While coasting down a steepish dirt road carrying a moderate load, 
braking now and again, trying not to ride the brakes, the pedal suddenly 
became very soft, and braking power greatly reduced.  This lasted until I 
reached the bottom of the hill, 3 miles or so.  At the next stop, the 
brakes seemed fine.  There was an odor burnt something afterward.  Since 
then, the horrible squealing of the brakes experienced first thing every 
morning, has vanished.  No other problems for 2 days.  

What happened?
