&gt;Is Ed Anderson of Adventurewagen, the same Anderson of Anderson/Behel
&gt;Volkswagen of San Jose?  I recently saw (at that dealer) the last VW
&gt;Adventurewagen -- a 1991 Syncro.  Real nice. It was said to have been
&gt;built for the Anderson who owned the VW dealership.
&gt;
&gt;Anderson is *such* a rare name...

No relation, as far as I know.  The Ed I know of in Ft.Bragg liked mine so
much when he put it together (his first white-on-white w/black accents)
that he later told me he built one like it for himself - he drove it all
over the southwest pulling a 2 horse trailer.  The '91 may have been an
even later one ( I think if I was in the business I'd build a new one for
myself every year!).
