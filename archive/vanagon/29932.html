Subject: retorquing heads


	I spoke with Victor at GEX a few weeks ago, and 
he mentioned that it was standard procedure to retorque
the lower head bolts.

	Being in college, and feeling rebellious, I am
wondering what good it does to only retorque the lower bolts.
If anything, wouldn't it make things worse by screwing up
the pressure distribution?
 
	Why torque the heads down really tight at all?
Does it hold ignition compression? Or is it a guard against
a fatigue failure of something or the other?
 
	So, in the meantime, I refuse to retorque them.
Everyone I talk to agrees to me (having a limited circle of like minded friends helps)
I *might* do them when I drop the engine to do the pressure plate,
which is coming far, far too soon.

Matt
