Subject: re:'79 bus:starts, doesn't start

&gt;Minor miracle yesterday: after taking the city bus out to rescue my Bus,
&gt;ta-daa! It actually turns over and starts just fine.  So I drive it home,
&gt;shut it off and turn it over again. . .and it starts again, no problem.
&gt;Hmmm. . .maybe my problems are over, I think, just a glitch.
&gt;
&gt;I try it again this morning, and nothing.  I try several times in
&gt;succession, but nothing happens though the indicator lights work f

HI, new here, so I hope this gets where it's going.  It's probably not the
starter, but don't rule it out.  More likely the same thing you see on (or
at least I've seen at one time or another through somewhere around 14 Vdubs.
Disconnect your battery ground cable, remove the wires from the starter
solenoid and clean them up (and the stud) or replace the cable connections
with some high quality connectors.  If it works, you got off easy,  if not,
probably is the starter.
&gt; Is it way up there?  Any way
&gt;to get at it?    Same as every other starter, it's not too far up there,
just more fun to get to.

Have Fun &amp; Good luck.
