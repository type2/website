Subject: Re: how do I tow a bus?!?

&gt;I'm going to buy a bus that I've got to move about 250 miles....
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to tow it with some sort of tow bar as my towing rig is not a 
&gt;class &quot;C&quot; and Uhaul won't rent me a trailer (It would probably be crazy 
&gt;to try and pull a trailer with a bolted-to-your-bumper hitch.(

No, more like suicide.  I _did_ pull my 71 home about 10 miles with a 
similar rig.  Wouldn't recommend it.

&gt;Anyway, I've tried some of the VW speciality shops, and they tell me 
&gt;towbards for busses (I need to tow a 71 window van) aren't retailed any 
&gt;longer.
&gt;IS this true? I need to get one, or rent a tow bar that will do the job. 
&gt;Someone suggested that I get the tow bar for the beetle and then modify 
&gt;it. OK, but what do I do??

This would take about as much work as manufacturing one from scratch.  A 
couple of things here- the front beam on a bus is a whole lot larger 
diameterwise than a bug.  Also, the distance from the bumper to the beam is 
longer too.  Me thinks that the tow bar would have to be cut and lengthened. 
  I know that Thom had made/bought a tow bar which bolts on after the bumper 
is removed.  I think that this is the best way to go.

Custom fabrication would be the way to go.  Where are you located?

Chris.
