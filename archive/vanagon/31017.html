Are these FRONT fogs you've mounted below the bumper?  If so, I'd think 
you'd get them smeared off whenever the bumper dips low to the 
road--crossing run-off dips, entering/leaving steep or abrupt driveway 
entrances, etc.  And if you ever take it off of paved roads, I'd just 
remove them completely before proceeding...

Just thought I'd mention it so you don't find out with a sickening 
crunch-tinkle sound...  (D'oh!).
