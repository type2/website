The weekend of flat tires is over.  My wifes family came up for a visit so I 
took a few half days off work to golf with the boys.  Day 1, I get a flat 
tire on my 84 Vanagon as I approach my house.  Before we could golf, we had 
to fix the flat.  Fortunately my new van came complete with a good spare and 
complete jack...  On the golf course, one of our two carts gets a flat. 
 Hmmmmm, thats strange.

Then yesterday, after our last round of golf, I spot an 82 Westy in the golf 
course lot with a Grandma, Mom (nursing a baby girl) and two other 
daughters.  Of course I had to help out!  Grandma told us her lug nuts were 
locked up and couldn't be turned.  She broke her lug wrench trying.  A few 
minutes later, I broke mine trying. bla bla bla....Boy am I glad mine broke 
after I needed it, before I needed it again!

Anyway, is there a recommended replacement (preferably a cast iron 
replacement) for the Vanagon lug wrench.
