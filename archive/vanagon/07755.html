&gt;so finally, i went to the top: talked to the top-dog. he says it's a
&gt;salvage car. vwoa bought it back from the owner, and has stripped the VIN
&gt;from it. and they are letting it sit there (while paying the dealer monthly
&gt;storage fees) until they decide to come get it and crush it. :(
&gt;
&gt;and all those camper parts are going to waste.
&gt;
&gt;of course, they'd much rather sell you NEW camper parts ...
&gt;
&gt;this does not make me feel all warm and friendly toward VWOA. :(

I would not go and blame VWOA so fast.  There are often several reasons why
they can't sell it or part it out.  This big thing you mentioned is that the
VIN was taken.  No VIN, no sales or transfers.  If you try to do anything with
the vehicle it will be considered as stolen.  There were several times where
my father was exporting used cars to Europe and the VIN did not match what was
on the title.  U.S. Customs does not like that.

Speaking of crushing, he does marine consulting for a stevadoring company.
That company handles the importing of BMWs, Jaguars and Volvos.  If a vehicle
is damaged in transport to the US a car representative decides if its 
repairable.  If it can be fixed it will be shipped back to the factory.
If not then it's sent to the crusher.  Sadly nothing can be taken off the car.
But they do, for fun, drain the fluids and see how long the engine will run
before seizing.
