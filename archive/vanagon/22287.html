Jim complains:

&gt; Well folks, they're stickin' it to us again.  We have a notice from KYB that
&gt; all Gas Shocks being shipped have to have &quot;Hazardous Materials&quot; Stickers on

That's interesting.  I have seen instuctions in the past that tell you how
to release the gas before tossing them in the trash.

I did learn back in June at a SCCA fire &amp; rescue (crash &amp; burn as it used to
be known) school that they can be deadly.  The gas shocks for bumpers, 
liftgates and suspensions become projectiles when heated up.  Could be the
reason why.
