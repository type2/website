&gt;&gt; &gt; I have noticed Vanagon drivers will wave in the middle of nowhere

&gt;&gt; Often frantically and with vigor!  :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I've noticed even non-vw people seem to view Vanagons differently:

Ain't that the truth.  At Busses by the Arch on Memorial day, our caravan
of about 55 busses got all kinds of frantic hand waves and horn honks by
all types of people in all types of vehicles.  It was a very uplifting
experience - almost restored my faith in the human race.  :-)
