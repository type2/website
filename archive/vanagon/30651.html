Subject:       A Manual Question

Hey all:

Went to a local VW place today and picked up some &quot;dealer only &quot; 
stuff. While I was there, some guy was forking over $93 for the 
Bentley Manual. However, on their manual rack they had the Hayes 
(Haynes?) manual for all makes and models. For the Vanagon it looked 
a lot thinner than the Bentley one (not that this matters).  I was on my
way out when I saw the manuals sitting there, so I didn't get the price. 

Can anyone give me a run-down on these. Are they as good as Bentley? 
Better? I'm sure it is mostly a matter of opinion, so all opinions 
invited.


Thanks

Matt
