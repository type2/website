Subject: aux wiring harness update...


 I went a picked up one of those updated wiring harnesses for the

 air flow box on my 2.1, the update seems to have taken care of the

 cutting out problems that i would experience while crusing the highway...

 ( a 200 mile round trip yesterday afternoon...)

 since i had access to a VW dealer's shop and tools yesterday,

 I decided to check the CO and make sure it was in the ball park...

 started by doing a pin out test of all components from the connecter at

 the ECU.. everything checked out , so then set timing and idle speed...

 (the way the digifant training manual specifies , unplug temp sensor
 
 plus power for idle stab. etc...)

 Then ,here is my problem, went to check CO. turned ignition off

 unplugged to 02 sensor, restarted engine took a reading...

 it was a bit to lean, made adjustments, this took a while

 because there doesnt seem to be alot of adjustment at the air flow box..

 the best way it seem is to rev the engine between adjustment of the air
 
 flow box and then you have to wait for the reading to settle....

 just turning to screw doesnt do to much...

 with the 02 sensor unpluged, i could set the CO to the specified .5%

 once you reconnect to 02 sensor it is supposed to return to normal

 1.1% to .3% . when i set the CO to around .5% (before reconnecting

 the 02 sensor) the engine was really running great.. about
 950 rpm really smooth no hesitation...,but when i reconnect the 02
 sensor the C0 really leaned out to much any the engine ran a lot 
 worse...rough idle, more heat, hesitation...
 so, maybe the 02 sensor may be bad...
 It is the three wire type..(heated) it has power ,so it is heating...
 does anyone have any experience with this...
 I was able to make the engine run richer, but it is not where it
 should be...it is running with a lot more power, but could run
 a bit better if i could get this 02 sensor to work right...
 
 any hints...

 later
 patrick
