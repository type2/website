Hi folks!

I've just been lurking out here on the fringe for a few weeks
now just waiting for the opportunity to jump in and introduce
myself.  And I gotta admit that that last posting on this thread
from Dan (revealing Peter's question) scares me a bit.
I just (3 months ago) aquired a cherry '89 Westfalia from a
couple in NC who took REALLY good care of it (and bought a 93
EV Winnie).  I can't find ANYTHING wrong with it.  It has almost
as much power as my Honda Civic Si, nary a scratch on it, and
the stove &amp; fridge had NEVER been used.  But it does have 85000
miles on.  So I need to be looking out for ALL THOSE problems????
I'm paranoid now!
  So, tell me, how am I gonna know when the CV joints go out
on it?  (even with my mechanically-challenged mind, I think I
can figure out the rest of the stuff)
  And for those of you with Westys, (1) I'm sure that at some
point in time I'll get caught camping with the top up in the
rain, so how do I keep it from getting all mildew-y (other
than the obvious--dry it out when I get home)?  And (2) Even
with the meticulous care the POs took with this gem, the top
of the poptop (originally a deep burgundy color) has
faded a little...now its kinda pink.  You can't see it unless
the top is up, so its not too important, but is there any way
that any of you can suggest to restore the rich color it once
was (short of having it painted)?  Can I wax fiberglass?  Can
I use something like NU-VINAL?  I'm clueless, and any suggestions
would be appreciated.

  Thanks!  And I sure have enjoyed the rich mix of banter!
