The Eurovan MV has a forward facing bench seat and two rear facing single 
seats directly behind the front seats.  There is a fold down table in 
between.  The cooler seat replaces one of the rear facing seats.  I'm 
sure it might be possible to put such a seat in the Microbus but not 
knowing your layout  I couldn't guess (bus with 2 bench seats in rear?) 
where.

I'm still awaiting a reply since I definitely want one of these seats.  
Was planning on getting one from the local dealer if I get out run for 
this one. :)
