Subject: April archives available via ftp

The archives for the vanagon list for the month of April are available 
via the listserv command 
get vanagon vanagon.94.04
which you send to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

and now, via ftp:
ftp lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
cd /pub/vanagon
dir
get &lt;file of your choice&gt;

A reminder that the file uncompressed is 1.2 meg, so if you use the 
listserv command, you'll get a large email message.  Let me know if you 
need the archive and this won't work for you.

I'd like to also offer this stuff via gopher, but I haven't really 
figured out a way to fit it in the heirarchy of biomedical information 
on our gopher &lt;smile&gt;

Have a day!
