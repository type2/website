Subject: Eurovan - One Answer, One Question

Just took the EV-Winnebago in for its 12,000 km service 
(basically an oil and filter).  Had a list of things that 
needed attention.  Perhaps other EV owners might be 
interested:

- occasional incidents of hesitation at startup from rest 
seem to have been caused by the failure of the Hall sensor. 
(don't ask me, I just write it).  A malfunction indicator 
light had been on, so I asked them to dump the diagnostic 
code from the computer.  Bum Hall sensor.

- my inability to run the fridge on propane was not due to 
my customary incompetence - the igniter was no good.

Here's my question for EV'ers...

the hood (engine cover) seems to be FULL of water.  Can this 
be?  Surely VW has built enough front-engine vehicles to 
know how to drain a hollow panel.  Anyone else have this 
problem?
