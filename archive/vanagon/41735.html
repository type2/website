Subject: Re: Additives...

&gt;am going to use anti-friction additives to prolong the life of
engine/transaxle. 
&gt;What can you tell me about the value of the different brands/types?  I have
had 
&gt;positive experiences with Slick 50, Engine Armor, Motor Honey, etc....any of 

These are some of the best cash flow devices known to man.

The best anti-friction device you can use is clean motor oil at regular
intervals.  End of discussion.
