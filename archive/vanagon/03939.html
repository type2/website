&gt; What's POR 15?

People had been discussing POR 15 on and off on the VW mailing lists for 
a couple months.  But no one had posted an address or anything.  So when 
I saw one in a Chevy mag I posted it on the Vintage VW mailing list.  
Well... it just so happened that someone lived near the company that 
makes/markets POR 15.  So they got some and tested it for us and made a 
full report to the Vintage VW list.  I can't remember the info right now, 
but here's a brief summery.

POR 15 is a liquid that can be painted on rusty surfaces, and then binds 
with the rust.  It's a little expensive, I think it was about $30 for a 
quart.  The company also makes a gas tank restoring kit for those with 
rusty tanks.  Hopefully the gut that went there can fill in all the 
little details.  If not I'll find and repost the address and phone # of 
the place.
