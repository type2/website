Well folks,

The new AFM did not help my running rich problem. Next step is
replacing the ECU. I have found one used for $250. Depending on where I
shop I could have gotten a new/rebuilt one for between $300-$600. But
this way I have one to take apart and study.

Wish me luck,

Steve

P.S. Anyone want to buy an AFM for $200?
