Subject: 71 Camper Curtain Question

I have replaced all the curtains in my 71 poptop, except the one on the
sliding door. I don't have the hardware that holds the curtain in the
sliding rail. I think they are called &quot;traverse rod carriers&quot;?. The only
ones I can find at local stores are way too big. Is there a place I can get
these, or a way to make the curtain work?


TIA
