Subject: Westfalia Registry



For all of you old Westfalia Owners out there, you might like to know that there 
is a &quot;Registry&quot; of old Westfalia's that is operated out of Germany by Michael 
Steinke. The basic jist behind the project is to get some idea of the number and 
consition of old Westy's that are still kicking. This is done by people 
completing registry forms (and mailing them in to Michael) that provide details 
on the completeness and condition of your Westfalia

If you would like to find out more about this undertaking please write to

Michael Steinke
c/o Westfalia Registry
Hagebuttenweg 10
60433 Frankfurt
Germany

Phone and Fax 0 69/54 19 18

BTW he also sells some very nice looking stickers that have either the Westfalia 
company logo (with Prancing Horse) on them or his own Westfalia Registry 
sticker/logo
