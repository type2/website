&gt; Hi all,
&gt;       I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while
&gt; going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?  Personally, I
&gt; sleep with my head to the rear but I have to be careful not to hit my
&gt; head on the shelf.  That's when I wondered if anyone else slept the other
&gt; way and why.  This is assuming you'd be sleeping in the lower level
&gt; (downstairs) of course.  Actually, now I'm curious about the upper level
&gt; as well.  Well???

I sleep in either direction, depending what's up hill and down.  I have
seen one VW ad that show a sleeping bag with its opening up front.
