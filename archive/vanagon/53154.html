Subject: Re: Silicon oil in Syncros viscous coupling

This is an *extraordinary* tidbit. Of course I'd like to know who said that

Thanks, Erik.

&gt;	Someone once told me the fluid in the coupling is made by 3M. I know
&gt;they make just about everything, but if that info is helpful I'll try to
&gt;track down (and remember) who told me that. Let me know.
