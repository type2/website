&gt; Hey I like these tires, they do have a coarse tread pattern, not as smooth 
&gt; as the Continentals, but they handle fine on my bus, 2 on the back, 1 Conti/ 
&gt; 1 Uniroyal on front, all LT tires. No squirming about, but the '85 vanagon 
&gt; will slide if pushed hard, we had a 'handling' discussion a while back re 
&gt; different years/models, so it's not just the tire to consider. another tire 
&gt; choice...
&gt; 
&gt; Uniroyal Laredo         195/75/R14      6/C/50          open tread all season
&gt;                                                         OK (lowish) noise
&gt;                                                         Handling ??, only 1
&gt;                                                         mounted, doesn't wallow
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
I have these Laredos on all 4 wheels. Handling good, not much sway and
steering effort low. Not an off-road tire (I think there is a related
Laredo with a more aggresive tread), I got stuck in some clay mud when the
treads got filled.
