Subject: Positive current from my generator !!!!

     Ok folks there's light at the end of the tunnel!
     
     The negative current problem on my rebuilt generator is no more.
     
     I followed the manual and it produces a lovely +18v without the 
     regulator. Here's the procedure for repolarisation of the generator 
     when disconnected from the regulator etc..:
     
     o    Connect terminal DF to the generator case.
     
     o    Connect a battery negative terminal to generator case.
     
     o    Connect the battery positive to generator terminal D+
     
     o    Watch with delight as the generator rotates as a motor
     
     o    After a few seconds disconnect and test as a generator.
     
     o    Yippee
     
     
     Lee.
