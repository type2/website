Subject: putting a pop-top in a bus

Has anyone ever changed a bus to a bus with a Westfalia pop-top?
I'm thinking of doing it to my 79 because I can't find any nice
campers out there.  Besides I don't need a refrig or sink. 
I'd like to know how hard it is to install the top or if you
let a body shop do it.  How much for a shop to do it?  How does it
look?
Any input appreciated!
Paul
