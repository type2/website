Subject: Re: Trailer Hitches For Vanagon Class III Found

This idea of a two wheeled powered trailer takes the cake. I had to burst
out laughing reading this because at first I found myself thinking, like,
wow, what a cool setup. It was then that I knew that I had lost my mind. 

Like, actually, I think we need a two wheeled powered trailer with its own
engine and a power take off supplying power to the van, not the other way
around. 

Anyway, the trailer hitch is all welded together as one piece that slips
into the body of the vehicle and mounts using the holes that are already
drilled in the vehicle. 

I don't believe any other trailer hitches are all one piece and include the
big sliding pieces that slide into the body of the vehicle.

They use the same two big bolts that you use now, except that one of the
bolts is put further in (toward the front, next to the engine) than in the
stock setup. 

The bumper mounts to this hitch assembly at the same points that the bumper
mounts to the vehicle now.

I doubt your class I hitch uses the same components as it looks like they
welded together train tracks to make this thing. (admittedly an exageration,
but you get the point)

&gt;immediately below the rear bumper and are painted black. With a Class III
&gt;&gt;hitch you get a receiver hitch hole. When you want to tow something, you
&gt;&gt;plug the ball mounting into that hole.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The hitches replace the two pieces of metal that hold your bumper up now.
&gt;&gt;They are longer and extend further in to the vehicle body.

&gt;Hi Derek, Thanks for the info. How are these hitches held in place? The 
&gt;regular bumpers, and the hitch that I have, use two bolts per side, near the 
&gt;rear apron. Has your mechanic added more mounting points? What 
&gt;size/thickness are the components for this hitch. It sounds identical to my 
&gt;Class I hitch, rated at 2000#.  tim s.
&gt;
&gt;PS: for the ultimate off-road trailer try contacting British 
&gt;Leyland/Landrover. They (used to?) sell a 2 wheel powered trailer that runs 
&gt;off the rear PTO unit.
