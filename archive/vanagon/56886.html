Subject: reliable shops nationwide?

Howdy,
Has anyone on the list been keeping track of names of  reliable Vanagon
shops whenever someone happens to post one?

My daughter and her fiance (a nice guy from Germany) are taking my 91GL on
a 2 month trip this summer and I want to make sure they can find good help
with the Vanagon if they need it.  It's in great shape with lots of new
stuff; exhaust, brakes, starter, battery, and new heads 10k miles ago, but
&quot;ya never know.&quot;  Present mileage is 115,000.  Since they have little
mechaical knowledge I thought it would be great if I could get a list of
places they could go for help (if needed) along the way. They will be
traveling from Buffalo, NY to the Southwest, maybe a little of Baja
California, the West coast, and home across the Northern US.  Any of you
fellow Vanagoons who can help with names and places please email them to me
directly.  Many thanks in advance.

If you see them this summer in my Tornado Red Vanagon,  NY license plate
&quot;YOOPER 1&quot;, give em a wave.
