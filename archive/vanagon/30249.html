To all who would like to have a EV fog light switch,

I'd be happy to contact my dealer here in the Netherlands
and send some to those who want 'em.

Cheers!

Brian.

&gt; Robert asked about EV fog light switches available in the US. Well
&gt; they are...but they are actually fog light switches for 93/4
&gt; Passats. The difference between the EV switch (which BTW is unobtainable
&gt; here in the US) and the Passat is that the Passat switches are placed
&gt; horizontally while the EV switches are vertical. The little fog light
&gt; symbol is skewed 90 degrees.
