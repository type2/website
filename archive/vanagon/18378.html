&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you using your factory rims?  How much clearance do you have on the 
inside and 
&gt;&gt;outside tire well of the rears?   Its hard to believe you got 205's in your 
rear wheel 
&gt;&gt;wells ------maybe I can do the same for my westy.

Ben,
I did some research about tires for the Vanagon. As far as the rims are 
concerned, 
VW has used the same width 5.5&quot; very many years. If you have a Vanagon, you 
will have
no problem with width-the 205 70 14&quot; were standard equipment on 88 &amp; newer. VW 
didn't
make any changes in the body, wheel well or anything else to accomodate the 
tires.
As others have posted, the 205 70's (or the slightly taller 75) really help 
handling
and ride. I suggest the Michelins and recommend you get the Mud Snow variety.

Jeff posted a note that VW lowered the suspension in 87 or 88(?) to improve 
ease of
entry. Around the Bay area, I've seen a few Splitties that would qualify as 
Very
Easy to Enter--as they are low low riders! They look very cool...but bouncy!

Good luck with you search
