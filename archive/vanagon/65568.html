Subject:      Headrest sockets

&gt;Sounds like really bad luck with your engine experience!
&gt;Do you happen to know if the 87 interior is the same as an 86?  I'm
&gt;looking for some 2nd and 3rd row grey cloth seats (GL style - with
&gt;armrests) with the headrest receptors along the tops of the seatbacks.
&gt;I'm not sure in what year this change was made, but a couple of people
&gt;have said 87.

     John, you may want to check the archives.  I seem to remember
someone pointing out that all the seats had the sockets for the
headrests, just not the plastic holes.  I've never checked it out for
myself.
