Subject: bus sightings


movie: The Commitments
       
       set in Ireland, about the life and times of a bunch of
       young musicians...

       at one point in the film, they cruse around in a 
       really nice later model (post 68) single cab.
       complete with a Piano in the bed..

       It's a cool scene...

       check out the cool towel rack looking bumpers on this
       truck...

       BTW, it's a good movie...

 Patrick...
