Subject: Re: 16&quot; Wheels


A few syncros with 16&quot; wheels made it to Australia.I have seen a syncro
camper and a syncro double cab that used to compete in rallies and was
factory prepared-ie full skid plate protection and no wax protection so
you could weld repairs when necessary.Used to be seen in pictures on the
back of VW mags here getting air off a jump on a beach.I believe it
eventually bent a bit in the middle.
Only possible drawback with 16&quot; wheels is,according to my owner's manual
you can't fit snow chains as there isn't enough clearance.

For your collective info...
