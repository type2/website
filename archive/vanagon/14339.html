In response to a dimininshing number of requests...

A Form Factor 41,42 or group 41,42  battery shape is the only widely available
battery that will fit easily behind the driver seat in the secret spider well.

The 42 needs ~10&quot; in the long dimension for installation, the 41 needs 11 3/4&quot;.

The 41 will have more capacity for the same grade of battery.

Delco does not currently make a thick plate (deep discharge) cell config. in 
this form factor.

Considerations:  An inexpensive auto starting battery will give you ~100 
minutes _at_20A.  A delco group 41-60 lead calcium will do a bit better than that
and will give more deep discharge cycles than a non calcium technology battery.

Or so sayeth the oracles of lead-calcium-sulphuric acid.

So on a $/use a moderatly priced series 41 seems to be the ticket.

If your westy has a relay with an included diode  wired between alternator blue
and ign switch you can rewire this &quot;refrigerator disconnect&quot; circuit to deal
with the charging issue and isolate the additional battery.

Do remember a 50A FUSE in the hot lead from the new battery.

For those of you with custom battery access and the right FSN you could plop
in a high volume NiCad radio battery and its custom charger at taxpayer
expense, I suppose.  This sort of lash-up will retail in the $750 range and
that's one hell of a long extension cord.
