Subject: Bad April Fools jokes...

My wife'll kill me if she finds out... 

Her co-workers played a nasty trick on her yesterday:

She works in the office of a seafood broker, and regularly calls a 
number of different accounts for bill payment, etc.
The president handed her a note asking her to contact a Mr. C. Lyon 
at the Vancouver Aquarium about an account problem...
Being a diligent employee, she of course did so without hesitation...
After repeating the name twice to the receptionist at the Aquarium, 
she notice the entire office laughing at her, especially the 
president.
