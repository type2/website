&gt;Click and Clack (the Car Talk guys) railed on a woman about the dangers
&gt;of driving her '76 Westy (tippy, no side impact protection -- suggested
&gt;she wear a footbal helmet).  Anyway, I've heard that the Vanagons are quite
&gt;safe.  Does anyone have real stats on this?  Vehicle deaths per mile?
&gt;Or Insurance company type of data?

Tom,
I recall clearly that figures published in about 1990 or 1991 ashowed that
the Vanagon had the second LOWEST fatalities/mile driven figure in the USA.
 Only bettered by the Volvo 240 Wagon.  I don't know who's figures these
were.  They did come either from the Fed Govt or an insurer's coalition.
