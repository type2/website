&gt; In the last year my 90 Vanagon has on 4 or 5 occasions showed symptoms of

&gt; described in the vanagon archives and the symptoms (and fix) were clearly
&gt; described by derekdrew.  The fix was to buy a auxillary wiring harness for
&gt; the air flow box (part # 025906302).  Up to this point I have not taken my
&gt; van to a mechanic to have this checked out because it is very intermittent
&gt; and has not really been a problem for me.  Anyways my question is this,
&gt; have other owners replaced this harness, and has the intermittent stalling
&gt; disappered after doing this fix?  Also how difficult is this for a
&gt; shadetree mechanic to do?  Has anyone replaced the harness and had the
&gt; problem persist?
&gt;

I took my '91 transporter syncro on a ski trip two weeks after I
purchased the vehicle. Two hours into the trip the same symptoms
appeared. I had no idea what was going on, but because there was a VW
dealership on the route that I was taking, I sacrificed half a day to
check it out. The service manager suggested the wiring harness fix, but
didn't have the part, so we continued with our ski trip with the problem
persisting at different times throughout the trip.
	Once home, I contacted the closest VW service centre and ordered the
harness, picked it up when it arrived and installed it in a couple of
minutes. The procedure is very simple for even an inexperienced owner.
Since I installed the fix I haven't had the problem occur again. This
was about five months ago.
