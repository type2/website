I think it was most of them 85 and later. But there is a whole array of
fuel related recalls for all of the Vanagons. Your best bet is to find a
&quot;honest&quot; VW dealer, take your van in and tell them to run the VIN# through
they're computer to see if there is any recalls that haven't been
completed. I had this done at two different places, even as small as our
Muncie VW dealer is, he was able to provide me with the recall codes that
were open. Even though he didn't know what they all were. After that they
order the parts, let you know when they come in and sched a time to do the
repairs (for free). BEWARE ! IF THEY REPLACE THE TANK, TELL THEM YOU WILL
PURCHASE THE HOSES AND STUFF IF THEY WILL REPLACE THEM WHILE THE TANK IS
OUT. They really shouldn't charge you for the labor because it's really no
more work for them to put the new stuff in, then it is for them to transfer
all of the old rotted stuff from the old tank. That's how they got me! :(

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;There is a recall in effect for a lot of the Vanagons to have the tank
&gt; &gt;filter,
&gt; and control unit replaced.
&gt; 
&gt; 	For what years is this recall in effect?
