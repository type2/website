Subject: Friday Fun: The PO


        The PO

As I work into the dark,
Removing cancer from my arc,
I curse the PO, that dreaded scum
&gt;From whence my dear-heart's troubles come.

I cannot say if last or first,
Which damned PO I think was worse,
For all to me are wreched slags,
Who brought this rust that makes her sag.

And then as light it comes to me,
through sale or grave I'll one day be,
(to some unknown who then will own
my dear sweet bus), a dreaded PO.

So when I go beyond the grave,
I pray my soul for heaven save,
And with their thoughts new owners know,
That I was truly a Good PO.
