&gt;So Steve J. says:
&gt;
&gt;As long as we are going to completely to death, I just wanted to add that
&gt;I remember someone a while back had mentioned that the ground shield was
&gt;shorted to the signal line.  Was that you John?  Anyway, even John Muir
&gt;mentions that most of the F.I. problems are some kind of continuity 
&gt;problems and have sent many a stranded motorist to the garage when all
&gt;that had to do was clean and crimp a loose connection.  I guess the 
&gt;tradition gets handed down.
&gt;

Yeah,  that was me.  There was a short between the two wires in the two
conductor cable coming from the oxy sensor to the ecu.
