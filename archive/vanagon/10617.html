&gt; Recycle it where???  around here in the Midwest there are no places of that
&gt; I know that recycle the sh*t.  The community recycling center only does Oil,

&gt; around here is &quot;just dump it down the drain, the sewage treatment plant can
&gt; handle it in small amounts.&quot;.

Hmmm... I take it to the auto parts store where I bought it and they
dispose of it.  I guess they don't do that where you are.  :/  Also,
every once in a while (quarterly, I think) they have a special pickup
at the post office here.  They sit in a parking lot for a day and take
hazardous waste for free from people.  Maybe your city officials would
know of something similar in your area?
