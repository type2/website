&gt;So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sadly I don't own a single VW.  I am looking at buying one that is in town.
&gt;&gt; Please advise on:
&gt;&gt; 71 camper top bus, has no propane tank under door like I've seen before.
&gt;&gt; Has 1 very well siezed motor, 1600 dp rebuilt once, and will need new heads, 
&gt;&gt; one has a spark plug hole
&gt;&gt; which has been helicioled and blew out.
&gt;&gt; Body good, little rust, one ding in door, but small.
&gt;&gt; Can anyone ID. the vehicle for me- that is whats the type of camper?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; With the siezed motor the lady wants $650 for it.
&gt;&gt; What do Y'all think?
&gt;&gt; Chris Bridge.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Since I don't know where you located, the first thing ya look for at this
&gt;price is rust.  If there is little or no body/pan rust, it's a steal.
&gt;The engine will probably have to be replaced and will cost anywhere from
&gt;$700.00 on up to $2K depending on whether you do the work or not and the
&gt;quality of the engine.  If it needs a tranny, then add $300 or so.  If it
&gt;has evidence of water leaking inside, I'd hesitate to by it at all as I'm
&gt;not a body person and there are still plentiful '71's in these parts (Sac-
&gt;ramento).  Still $650 is not a bad asking price.  I'd start low with the
&gt;seller say $350 and work from there.

Thanks-
a couple of things- $650 was what I haggled her down to.
how do I know the trannys' condition If it doesn't have a good engine.
Right now It's sitting in a FLAR yard.  (where she had it towed after it 
seized.)
They told her 1500 to put a engine in it.  They also know who has been 
working on it.  
Thanks.
