&gt; Was this really written in 1948?  The term &quot;bug&quot; as applied to an engineering
&gt; failure/problem, has been credited to Grace Hopper sometime in WWII, but I
&gt; am quite suprised that it migrated this far in such a short time!
&gt; 
I recall seeing this quote, in a beetle history book, although I 
don't recall if 'bug' was actually used... it may have been 'problem'
