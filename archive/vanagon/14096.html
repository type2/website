So Steven &quot;Backroad-Passenger&quot; Johnson sez:

&quot;I think Martha should just drive to a Ramada Inn and camp there...&quot;

Gak!  -  As soon as I get my shower set up working properly, and spring
for the 12v waring blender, I won't need no steenkin' Ramada Inn!  On
top of it all, I'm now working on plans (deranged fantasies?) to put
a Doughboy pool-liner in the inside of my westy and make it instantly
convertible to a jacuzzi for these off-road excursions.  The stumper
is now how to heat the water (cuz I don't have 12 golf-car batteries
the way Schwarze suggests), so I'm toying with the idea of a snorkel
stove, which is a submersible water-cooled woodstove to heat spas.
That way, we can fuel it with beer bottles and left-over circuit
boards!
