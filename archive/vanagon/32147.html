&gt;My bus is a '71. Bob Hoover told me to look for a distributor marked
&gt;-205P, which I will do.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe
Hi Joe,
   If your have distributor problems, have you considered a 009?  If you
have and had a problem with it ie: flat spot  the problem may have been
carb related.  In a past issue of &quot;The Transporter&quot;, LiMBO's newsletter our
resident mechanic Bob Donalds at Boston Engine wrote a nice artical about
this problem.  In short the problem comes from the 009's primary timing. At
8-10 degrees advance the engine idles to fast.  In order to correct this
problem most people ajust the idle mixture screw, usally turning it so far
in that when you step on the trottle the transition from idle circut to
primary circut you have a fuel imbalence. Flat spot.  Now Bob fixed this,
I've done it myself, by removing the carb and pluging the hole in the
throttle plate. You can use a screw of rivit, your choice. I used a screw
and loctited it inplace so it won't fall out. What this does is force the
air to flow though the idle circut and then you can back out that mixture
screw so that the transiton is better.  I've done this and it works. You
can set the 009 to specs and it will idle normaly. I hope this helps if you
want the complete artical let me know or call Bob Donalds at: (508)
668-2676.
