&lt;&lt; got another question. can i perform a leak down test? i was checking out
my
 compression tester this past weekend and notice that it disconnects from the
 gauge and leaves me with a hose with a fitting at each end one screws into
 the spark plug hole and the other has a male air fitting that i could hook
&gt;&gt;
 

Yes you can. You really need the gauge set so that you can get a quantity of
leakage that is measusrable.  Milton sells a kit for about $70 that is very
easy to use.  Only one adjustment and it gives reading in percent.
 Professional gauge sets have two gauges and require calibration.  The Milton
will more than do the job.  BTW, when putting full pressure into cylinder to
determine source of leakage, be sure to restrain engine from turning.
