&gt;      Greetings Vdubbers - can anyone help with a frustrating problem?
&gt;      It goes like this - my '78 van has the window winder mechanism missing 
&gt;      from the driver's side door so I go and purchase the mechanism which 
&gt;      is indeed an ingenious device.

Please, where did you get the new mechanism?  I need to replace one in my 
van, and it gets damn hot in NC not being able to roll down the driver's 
side window.

&gt;      However, after a frustrating Saturday afternoon I can't work out how 
&gt;      to fit it as the actual bit that the winder handle screws onto appears 
&gt;      to have to go through a gap between the window glass channel and a 
&gt;      recessed bulge in the inner door - it won't go through.
&gt;      I ended up trying to take the mechanism to pieces and ruined it so I 
&gt;      have to buy another one now.
&gt;      I can't find any reference to this problem in Muir or other manuals. 
&gt;      Has anyone any hints, tips or comments etc - I would be very grateful.

I have not tried this yet (decided to wait till I have the new part to 
tear the door apart) but I've been told that the vertical piece between 
the main window and the triangular vent window can be moved to get the 
window-roller mechanism out.
