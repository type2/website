underpowered?   

It doesn't have to be such a big deal .  My '85 is sorta underpowered. At 
least compared to my Mercedez Benz and the gorgeous GTO I had in high 
school years ago, the one I totaled 'cuz I loved speeding around a lot.

I just slam a new tape of my favorite music in the player when I go up a 
hill and kick back. Sometimes I mind it, but rarely. I live near the 
Santa Cruz mountains south of San Francisco. We have LOTS of hills.

James
