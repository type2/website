Subject: new way to heat food while camping

Martha,

  Those heaters are likely another version of those used by the military with
MREs,(Meals Ready to Eat or Meals Refused by Ethiopians). The meals can be
had for around $3 and the heaters for about $1 where ever fine surplus is
sold(gun shows etc.).

  At the risk of sounding like a low brow, the meals are actually quite good
and include appetizer, condiments, drink,dessert, main course and toilet
paper all at the rip of a bag!  The heaters work as you described although 5
minutes seems more like it.

  Keep a couple in the camper for emergency snacking .I recommend the BBQ and
rice but that may be just a southern tendency.
