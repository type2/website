James,
About the torque wrench, I'd go for the Craftsperson (9)44543.
It's got a 3/8ths drive biderectional ratchet, and torques from 
20 to 150 foot pounds.

About you're other tools, if you're going to build up an engine and
install it in your bus...
That 100 pc. set is a good place to start, but you're gonna need
feeler guages,  ring compressors, allen wrenches, crows foot wrenches,
etc... etc... etc...
That's not even mentioning the electrical equip. you'll need,
Continuity tester,  test light...

I hate to be a downer but you could easily spend $1000 just to be
moderately well equiped.
That's what having friends is for.  :)
I hope that they have a lot of what you need and that you have only
the best luck in your engine build.
Oh, another thing you might need is a 12 pack of cold beer so
the helpfull friends will be willing to come back tommorrow.


Cheers
