Subject: Oil Pressure Sender Revisted

I would like to thank all the people for all the imput regarding my
difficult to remove oil pressure sender on my 83.5 waterboxer.  However,
the problem is not related to mentally deficient VW dealers in the Great
White North.  After the dealer was unable to remove my sensor I went to
an independant, but VW trained, vanagon specialist.  When I told him the
problem, he laughed, But when he got down to it he couldn't remove it
either.  Listen: the sensor is not the normal (24mm)size. Who would put
an oversized sensor in a relatively young and clean motor? Vanagon oil
pressure sensors are cheap, doesn't even a beetle one fit?
Has anyone with an 83.5 ever changed their sensor?  I can't believe that
I got aftermarket crud in there.
Thanks, Lloyd Perkins  dad_at_together_dot_net
