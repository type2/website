&gt;Didn't Maxwell Smart drive up in a Karmen(SP) Ghia during the
&gt;opening shot of &quot;Get Smart&quot;?


Nope-- that was a Sunbeam Tiger. Same size and weight as a Ghia, but
with a Ford 289 V8 engine under the hood. My dad used to say you could
remove the drive shaft from that car, and drive it around powering it
with the cooling fan...

And, adding injury to insult, Agent 86 crashed it into the rear of
a truck every episode (shudder)
