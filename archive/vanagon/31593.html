&gt; You just bought the wrong year....My '71 cost me peanunts to run.  The last

&gt; trips it's wonderful. When I get a little money ahead I'll pull this engine and 
&gt; put in a 1776 with weber progressive carb. and then I should have the perfect

&gt; &gt;I purchased my 84 van from the origanal owner.  He took great care in his
&gt; &gt;vehical, as do I.  This van has 164k miles on it.  Between the 2 of us
&gt; &gt;(mostly him).  We have over $17,000 in receipts since it was purchased.  If

I was thinking the same thing when I saw this post.  I've rebuilt the
engine twice, converted it to 12V, replaced the tranny, and replaced most
of the brake parts on my '66.  And I think I've spent less than $3000 on
the bus including the original purchase price ($300).  It still looks like
crap, but it's mechanically sound (#1 in my book), and probably won't get
ripped off. 

I couldn't afford to own any vehicle that cost $17,000 to maintain, 
unless that was spread out over 10 years, and it was a VERY nice ride.
And then I'd need to stop buying beer to afford it.  Can't have that. :)
