Subject:      1995 Eurobago

I bought a 1995 Eurovan Camper 5sp for $34k, kept it 2 years, put 28k
on it and sold it for $20k.  The 2.5 litre Audi 5 cyl. engine was
superb and perfectly matched in torque and HP (107).  The suspension
and braking were equally impressive; it would cruise at 80-90mph and
deliver 18mpg.  The A/C, visibility and handling were very good.
Mechanically, the vehicle was very sound.  A draw back was difficult
access to oil filter (skid plate had to be removed and special tool
for removal).  Air intake system was a work of ingenuity, with a
massive filter housed in an accessible canister.  The Winnebago
conversion, while rugged and including good components, resulted in a
lot of extra weight.  The vehicle weighed 4700 lbs.  Winnebago used
1/2&quot; - 3/4&quot; plywood everywhere instead of aluminum.  The rear bench
seat was made of steel and lacking in any comfort or orthopedic
design.
