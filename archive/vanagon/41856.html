Subject: Re: Will these wheels work on my '63 Bus?

 One thing to note however - I wouldn't run tires that are larger then 195x15
(70 series).  I ran 205's very briefly when I encountered that the front's
would rub against the rear portion of the front tire well when I'd hit the
brakes (even gently).  Had to switch 'em to 195's.  205's work OK in the
rear, tho it gets real tight like Jon said in his post.  Price of $140 sounds
- - - - -

i put 205P15s on my 61, and there was no rubbing.
