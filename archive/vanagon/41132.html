&gt;I'm fairly new to computers, and maybe I'm wrong, but I can load my

&gt;Therefore, from the standpoint of cost of online time, I prefer the

It would be fairly straightforward to set up an email gateway to a
newsgroup.  There may already be several set up and ready to use.

&gt;Besides, who said we had any choice in this matter?

Our input should be considered.  Gerry does lots of work maintaining the
list, and the list has grown considerably past the point where a newsgroup
is feasible.  We should consider the option.
