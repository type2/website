&gt; &gt;      last winter there was a big thread among Westie owners about putting
&gt; &gt;      an inverted clay flower pot over the burners of the propane
&gt; &gt;      stove, getting the pot to radiate some heat.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, David Schwarze uses this method and if you try to read his posts,
&gt; it becomes *real* evident what the effects are. ;)  

Doh.  =)
 
&gt; Seriously, from previous threads about this, as long as you keep a 
&gt; window cracked open while doing this setup, you should be okay.

All of the posts about being poisoned by a non-vented system like this
have made me decide to get a real vented propane furnace instead of
doing the clay pot thang.  It does work okay, but doesn't provide enough
heat to warm people on a ski trip.  You need serious BTU's for that,
methinks.

In the interim, the clay pots with a muffin fan blowing over them,
combined with a cracked window and roof vent, are sufficient to raise
the inside temp a few degrees and make things more bearable.
