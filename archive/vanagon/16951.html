Subject: Re: First year of Disk Brakes?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If anyone can tell me the first year for disks on the bus, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;I think it is 1970 but can anyone tell me conclusively?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;..Markus
I'm pretty sure that it is 1971.  Hence the unusal number of them in the 
weakly stats.  In 73' the brakes calipers were enlarged.  Most of you got 
the T4 engine with it though.
