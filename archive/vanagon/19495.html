&gt; Alternately, perhaps I will just buy a new tranny and rebuild
&gt; the motor myself; in that case is it worth it to go to larger
&gt; cylinders, longer rods, and the headwork to turn my 1700 into a
&gt; 2000?

I think so, if you can find the rods.  If you don't have the rods,
it won't be cost efficient as a set of 2-liter rods without exchange
will run you over $500.

&gt; Any advice on new, improved, possibly even legal
&gt; carburetion (or, with the 2 liter, FI)?

I like the original stock Solexes.  Am I the only one?

&gt; This bus once had air conditioning, I think installed (and later
&gt; removed) by the mechanic that owned it before I did.  Now that I
&gt; live in California, I'm considering A/C again.  Will a 2 liter
&gt; engine be significantly better in case I decide to re-install
&gt; A/C?

I'm told it will be.  I have non-functioning A/C also with hopes of
someday fixing it.

&gt; Finally, does anyone have a 72 or similar vintage brick with a
&gt; working, non-oily smelling heater, or am I doomed to driving a
&gt; cold or smelly bus?  I have been totally unable to track down
&gt; the source of the oil smell in my heater. 

Make sure your oil breather box is not spewing oily smelling air into
the engine compartment.  That air will go straight into the heating
system.
