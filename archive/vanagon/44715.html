Subject: 86 Westy Syncro oli woes part II....

  I guess I still have a ways to go before the big road trip in August . I'm
going to try a heavier wt. oil, right now I'm running the 10w40. I've checked
the relief valve , though when I took it out it seemed to of been in the
wrong way . The little metal plug like device seemed to be upside down ,
looking at Bentley the open end should be down, is this correct? The other
thing is that when the engine is running it's as quiet as the new Westy I
once {and long for now } owned. When we've done some long distance runs up to
New England , this van  runs just fine, after 400 miles or so,  you can still
grab and hold the dipstick . It runs smooth and is very quiet no rattles or
taps,. can I assume that these little cues are really not that significant .
                                                                       I
located the sending unit at the low pressure switch side between the
pushrods,it extends out about 2 inches at the end of a tee.
                                                     What is involved with
removing and installing the oil pump.?
                                           Sorry for all the rambling, but I
really thought I'd kick most of the problems in the ass.I guess this is the
Zen side of Westy ownership !!!!!!!
                          
                    Thanks I feel better already,
                       Kris
