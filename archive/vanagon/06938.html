&gt; &gt;concern, higher head temps (this may be more important for a Vanagon engine
&gt; &gt;that is operating at 350F). Joel says its ok, but since he doesn't have a
&gt; &gt;PhD in physics I am not sure I can trust him....;). DC

&gt; nyuk nyuk nyuk. don't forget that i had an external oil cooler on that bus
&gt; .. so that might have brought my temperatures back down (if they did go
&gt; up when i welded the egr stuff closed).

  Joel, 

  you haven't read the TOMES of stuff that Gene Berg has written about oil
  coolers, head temps. etc. 

  Hanging extra oil coolers all over your bus will lower your oil temp. but 
  it won't save your heads. Think about whats happening - the oil goes out
  through the pushrods, splashes around a little on the rocker arms and then
  drips back down through the pushrod tubes. There just isn't much chance
  for heat transfer from, say, the exhaust valve seat area to the oil. The
  oil gets heated up from friction and it's contact with the hot stuff down
  in the crankcase area - the back and skirts of the piston for example. Lots
  of us know people who have put on extra coolers, drive with reckless abandon
  and just can't understand why they are dropping valve seats and burning 
  valves.


   Overheatedly yours,
