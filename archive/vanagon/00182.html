 Hi,
	Further to my post last week about high performance versions of the
transporter (to which I've had no replies/followups: Humff, I thought it was
quite good! :-) I thought some of you might be interested to hear of a new
vehicle VW is releasing later this year. There was an article in this weeks
Sunday Times motoring section about a new &quot;People Carrier&quot;, seven seater one
box design that VW are producing in collabaration with Ford (VW design, Ford
production). Are these the cars that are called &quot;Minivans&quot; in the US, BTW?
Both will sell the car with slightly different trim (eg oval grille on Ford).

 There are several engine options described: 90bhp direct injection diesel,
115bhp 2.0 litre (don't know if this is Ford's or VW's engine) and, of course,
the VR6! I assume this is the 174bhp VR6 from the Golf rather than the 190bhp
Corrado engine. Looks like VW are competing with the Espace after all.

 I presume this car is being prepped for European release, at the moment.
Anyone keen to see it in the US should probably start enquiring now! Note that
Ford-Europe and Ford-US are still pretty well differentiated at the moment
which may complicate matters.

Cheers,
        W.
