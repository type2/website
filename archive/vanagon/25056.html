Subject: Re: 83 Diesel price advice (Paul)

Hi Paul! Thank you for your advice. Definitely I would not sell my 78 Westy.
I just want to find a reliable transportation to go to work at the University
of Puerto Rico. A friend of mine advice me not to buy the Diesel Vanagon   
because there are few in the island and it will probably be hard to find parts
for her. Is it easy to find parts for her in the States? Are the parts cheap?
Thank you again.
