Subject:      propex heaters (again)

I just got off the phone with propex in England.  They quoted me 350
pounds for a propex 1600 heater.  this translates to around $570, add for
shipping and i'll be past $600.

Its getting mighty cold here at night and i'm going to get one.  They did
say that if we could pool several of us together, they could cut the cost
down, down by how much, they didn't want to commit (sorry i'm not a
wheeler-dealer and dont know how to make them commit to a price).

If you are interested, let me know and i'll get back to them.  Of course,
i want serious people, not someone who thinks it may be nice and then
back out.
