Subject: For sale stuff, mostly for Bay window people

Hi folks,

Here's the stuff for sale--buyer pays shipping from Connecticut:

---Curtain Set for 68-72 Westfalia--It's a blue/white pattern that is
apparently not original (original was yellow/brown I believe).  Do not have
the piece for the front window, but have side curtains for the front
passenger and driver's doors (68-70 type).  Made from durable cloth.  Some
are faded to the point where the blue is washed out, others still have clear
pattern.  $25

---Aftermarket &quot;blind spot&quot; mirror.  Multiple mirrors in 3 foot long
rectangular housing that are angled to assist in viewing blind spots.  Had
this in my 70 camper for awhile--helped with the passenger rear side
blindspot somewhat.  $5

---Distributor for 74-79 (non-California Emissions) bus  (VW # 021 905 205P,
Bosch # 0 231 168 005) Comes with new condensor, but no cap, rotor or
points.  Vacuum diaphram works.  $25

---Used front air vent grill (painted red) for 68-72 bus.  Has some rust on
inner side but not bad.  $10

---Non-Doghouse upright oil cooler.  I bought it new and used it for less
than 500 miles before I converted to doghouse style.  $10

---Used Oil pump and cover for Auto-stick beetle (113 115 109, 113 115 233A) $10

---12v electric &quot;Back seat heat&quot; model ceramic element heater.  This is the
same one JC Whitney sells for $100.  I was foolish enough to buy this new
when I bought my first bus.  It doesn't heat the bus in cold weather.  Comes
with all wiring/switch/instructions.  If you want heat, buy a gas heater,
but if you want to buy this for some reason I can't really think of right
now (weird experiment?): $20
