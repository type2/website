Subject: Corrado Mailing List

Hello Bill -

I am also on the Corrado mailing list.  I have a 94 SLC with 5k miles and love 
it.  I am thinking about being the regional rep. for the Corrado Club.  Just 
wanted to say hello see someone from the Twin Cities on the mailing list as 
well!

Take care and happy driving...
Jeff
