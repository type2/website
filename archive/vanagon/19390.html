&gt;   Well, yesterday someone decided to give my happy, peaceful,
&gt; brightly-hued 67 an extra stripe with their key yesterday. The nice
&gt; person graciously made sure the stripe went All the way down the side,
&gt; and was very deep as well. Just curious as to if any other busses,
&gt; especially the more colorful ones, have ever been, er, shall we say
&gt; &quot;modified&quot; by the less than adoring public?

Sorry to hear about this, Richard.  It's a shame we have to share this
world with losers like the one that defiled your bus.  My strategy is
to leave my bus in such pitiful-looking shape that instead of keying it
people will leave money underneath my wipers.  Hasn't worked yet,
though.  =)
