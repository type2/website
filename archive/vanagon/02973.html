Subject:       type 1 engine in t2

I have recently acquired a '71 bus and a 1641 engine out of a type 1.  It was
my understandind the engine are interchangeable for that year of van with the
type 1's.  The engine fits, but it looks like the sheet metal on the front
(fif) of the engine falls short of the body of the van.  My question is this.  Do I only 
need a different type of tin for that area or is something missing on the bus or what?  I really
want to get that engine compartment sealed adequately. 
Any help is much appreciated,
Mike
