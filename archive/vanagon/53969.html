Perhaps the starter is not rotating the engine fast enough??

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;  Is it possible that there is something in the ECU that controls starts
that
&gt;  has failed but would not affect the running once started? If it is
possibly
&gt;  the ECU, where is the little bugger and can it be swapped easily between
my
&gt;  van and hers?

I doubt this is the cause, but it is easily swappable.  It's located under
the driver's side of the rear seat.  It's attached with a black metal
bracket/cover to the firewall.

Good luck,
