Subject: Re: Big Engine Bozo's

But what are your recommendations anyone with experience.  I've heard 
many horror stories of 2000+ sized engines burning up and not 
lasting long.  I'm trying to convince him of durability over power 
(1776).

Our local mechanic buddy will put it together right, and he's 
recommended the 2020 for power.

I recommend 1600 sp

probably not what you wanted to hear, but im coming from the cheaper to put
together, heads don't crack, reliability point of view.   I have even been
known to *shim* the heads to -reduce- compression, to make the engine last
longer and get better milage.  A splitty isn't a roadster, by any stretch of
the imagination, and it certainly doesn't handle like one.
