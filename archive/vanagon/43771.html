Subject: Re: Type 2 Engine Mount


&gt;I successfully drilled and tapped bolt holes in a bug engine so that I
&gt;could mount it to the rear support

This works only if the case on your engine is the busmount or &quot;universal&quot;
case, that has the bosses there but undrilled. I got a '74 bug engine
for my '69 bus that was like this-- all three bosses (the thick, roundish
metal pieces below and to either side of the oil pump) were there, and
lined up nicely with the rear engine mount of my bus, but they had no
holes to recieve the bolts. A little work with tap&amp;die, and the engine
went right in.

Earlier bug engines did not have these bosses at all, so there's nothing
available to drill. It's these early engines, also '67-earlier bus engines,
that the busmount adaptor kit is intended for.

Anyone know what year bug engines, were built with (unused) bosses
so that the same engine case could be used on both bug and bus assembly
lines?

A cautionary note: One listmember mentioned that the use of the busmount
adaptor kit stresses the oil pump case. Could well be, tho I've seen
several of these things used with no apparent ill effects. But some older
engines (maybe 1300cc and smaller?) had 6mm studs holding the oil pump
cover on instead of the stronger 8mm studs used in later engines. I'm
not sure I'd trust those dinky 6mm studs to hold half the weight of
the engine. Anyone know if there are kits and/or methods of putting the
stronger 8mm studs into these 6mm oil pump cases? Is there enough metal,
clearance, etc. to simply drill and tap them, or would this seriously
weaken the metal around the oil pump?
