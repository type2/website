Subject: Wipers work - NOT!

Does anyone have any hints for checking the wiper relay?
I have wipers that in the down position will not run intermitently, nor will
the rear
wiper work. I do hear the relay clicking about every 7 seconds though.

Unfortunately the Vanagon manual does not seem to have any info on diagnosing
the function of the wipers or relay.

Thanks
