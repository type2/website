Subject: Skylight Solution

List,	
	
	I was surprised at how many responces I got on my first posting. Seems
these factory skylight lenses are real junk. Well, I'm still putting the
finishing touches on mine and it's quite cold outside so I'm waiting for
a sunny day. It still looks cool! It's really not anything too special
or complicated, here's what you need...

1&gt; Piece of pixiglass at least 13in. by 17in. to cover the opening.
Measure yourself to make sure. Use something pretty thick. Try for 1/2
in.

2&gt; Jig saw and drill with 1/4 in. bit. 8mm wrench.

3&gt; Assorted nuts, bolts, metal or rubber washers. (If not available,
tilt head sideways and tap it.)

4&gt; Silicone sealent. (black or clear)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the problems. My solutions are given.

1&gt; The hindges want to hold the front of the glass too high. Either bend
the hindges down, or use rubber or metal washers as spacers. I used
rubber, looks better. You will need to replace the bolts that hold the
hindges to the glass now because they won't be long enough.
   Also you might need to remove some of the material from the hindge or
the glass where they merge and get in the way of each other. Try a fit
and look on the outside to illustrate this. It's hard to describe. 	

2&gt; For cutting off the corners I used the original skylight as a
template for the curve and it wasn't quite right. The curve needs to be
a bit larger. The 13in. by 17in. measurement seems to be on the money
though.

3&gt; If your glass isn't perfectly flat you're going to have to put a bead
of sealant on the mating surface between the glass and the black rubber
seal from the old lens. I would suggest doing this anyway because the
old seal isn't very flexible. Try to put it on as evenly as possible.
Don't use too much, You can always add more later. Alow it to dry
completely before checking the fit. It should be dry to the touch. If
you have a big head you might let someone else do this, the sealent will
get all over yourself. Or do this step from the outside of the van.

4&gt; Check the fit and apply more sealent as needed. Build it up in small
amounts. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	That's as far as I got so far. I'm working on the crank arms so the
glass will go up and down. The crank bracket bolts down easily. Warning,
the crank bracket has three bolts that hold it down. Don't drill out the
middle one. You won't need it and it gets in the way of the crank arms.
If it's cold where you live too, duct tape the crank bracket to the
housing will hold it down untill it warms up.  
	You will have to seal the inside of the bolts and the mating surface
between everything you bolt to the glass and the glass itsself.
Otherwise water will leak through. But I'm sure not as bad as the leak
you have now.

	Hope this helps everyone. Try to get a good deal on the pexiglass. A
hardware company I checked wanted a fortune for their stuff. Still
cheaper than the oem lens. If anyone out there wants one of these precut
for them I might be persuaded to do so. I still have my template. Once
you have the glass cut it's all just nuts and bolts.

Good Luck,
Erik
