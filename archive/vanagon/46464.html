  What it is is a 1977 Riviera Campwagen.  I've never heard
of it before, but I think I like it better than a Westfalia.  The 3/4
length roof raises straight up instead of tilting giving at least 6'5&quot; of
head room (I'm 6-2).  Has Norcold 12/125v reefer, Coleman 2 burner range
and FORCED AIR FURNACE!!&quot;

  Now this is one I'd like to see made available by images scanned and 
posted to an internet site.  Very interesting.
