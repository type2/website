I see this problem has come up again.  I tried to respond last week but my
machine was fouled.  My '87 came with the same problem when I got it last
spring.  I succeeded in stopping the rust by firstly removing the seam
goop in the seam between the two panels then clean and sand the seam well.
Then put on a *GOOD QUALITY* rust primer then paint the area.  THEN you
can FLOOD the seam with oil from the inside by removing the electrical
hookup cover and sqirting oil down the chanel that you will see.  You can
also access this chanel from under the sink cabinet by making a hole in the
panel board.  The chanel is just that, a chanel, and will hold the oil.  You
should see oil seeping to the outside in a few days, this is good and it
will stop the area from rusting again.  It's best to let the paint dry
well before the oil treatment.  Hope this is helpful !

Cheers 

Frank
