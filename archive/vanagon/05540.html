&gt; 
&gt; Just out of curiousity, what do you camper owners use the pop-top 
&gt; for?  Added headroom, or do you actually sleep up there as well?
&gt; I can't imagine leaving the top up when it's 10 below.  Do you just
&gt; have it open when cooking, etc, and then close it (in the cold months)
&gt; when it's time sleep?
&gt; 

	I consider the poptop to be a luxury, a luxury I loved.

	Even at 6'2&quot; I can maneuver around on my (LL Bean) stool and
	cookup a decent meal in cold weather. So, having a hardtop would work
	as a camper for me. 

	But, the poptop....it adds that romantic extension that makes
	the VW camper so special. The obvious addition of standup capability
	and the additional bed space are nice, but I love the airy feel
	you get with the roof up; the wind action....it offers the illusion
	yer not in a car.

	One of my choice ways to weekend is to drive to the sand dunes on the
	central Oregon coast, backup into the dunes in a sparsely populated
	area, pop-the-top, put up the curtains, drop the seat, fold out the 
	futon, get out some soda water, put on some Elgar/Ravel/Horowitz,
	flop and read for a couple hours, walk the beach for a couple more,
	return and cookup some pasta. With the top up  it's so easy and
	relaxed.
	
	And, kids love that 'second story'!
