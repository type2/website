The October 1997 issue of Hot VW's has an editorial about if they should
include more about the water cooled vw's in future issues.  They talk about
alternating issues every other month with a section devoted exclusively to
the water cooled VW market with Vanagons and Eurovans noted!   But before
they jump in and do it they want more input.  So lets give it to them!
They want to know our feelings and a simple yes or no,  and mail them to:
