Mark,
If you get your +(hot) for the new relay (the small one) from terminal 86
of the refridg relay, what you will in effect do is power up the new relay
AFTER the alternator kicks in ( This is a good thing ). Do what the
instructions that came with the new relay said with the only difference
being where you get the signal to engage from (the refridg relay instead of
the ignition switch). If your intentions were to have an emergency backup
starting battery, this won't work unless you do a bit more wiring and add
another switch. If you want to have the new relay (and battery) kick in at
startup every time you turn on the ignition, then go to terminal 85 or the
ignition switch...
Hope that helps,
Bob Bellanca

PS: I'm doing this from memory so just make sure that term. 86 is the one
that is dead till the alt light turns off once you fire up the motor...
