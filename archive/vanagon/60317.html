&gt;   It just goes
&gt;  &gt;&gt; 'whir,whir' as if it had a dead battery (not the case) or was suffering

&gt; from
&gt;  &gt;&gt; vapor lock.  Anyone have any ideas?
&gt;   Wires were slowly parting, to the
&gt;  &gt;point where they would work only when the temperature was cool.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  
&gt;  What do you mean by whir whir?  Is the bendix engaging the starter? Or is
&gt;  the starter just spinning without turning over the engine? Those solenoids
&gt;  can be the source of such things. I don't know if the Vanagons starter
&gt;  motor is a two part device where you replace the starter and solenoid
&gt;  separatly or not. More guess than diagnosis, but I thought I chip in
&gt;  anyway.
&gt;  
&gt;  
 The whir is a weak attempt at the engine turning over.  Te bendix engages
and the starter turns the engine, but it turns as if the battery was almost
dead.  Starter and solenoid are usually replaced together as I did in this
case.
