well, they are all  lovely now, aren't they?

did you hear congress passed a bill to allow oil drilling in a nat'l wildlife
refuge in Alaska  &quot;to make money to reduce the deficit&quot;  ha.  and i have a
bridge to sell you.  Goodbye caribou ( the drilling site is at the caribou's
breeding site,   to which they migrate every year)

funny enough, the Alaska senator is now saying they don't want to share the
oil taxes 50 50 with the feds, but 90 10.   

so for those who say, well you drive, don't bitch,  I say,  you can't really
believe that these companies are acting in anyone's interest but their own
pockets.   What wrong with holding them to standards that are in the public's
interest?    Caribou are important too.   They don't drive cars.
