Subject: RE: EV A/C Question....

        Ric:
        
        Concerning the A/C and its relationship to fan speed in an E-Van.
        
        I had never paid any attention to the fan speed until I read your 
        post.  That led me to check for this condition in our 
        &quot;Mom-mobile.&quot;
        
        In our GL, (1 year old, 13,000 miles) the low speed fan comes on 
        when the engine is first started for the day.  The high speed 
        kicks in as soon as the a/c is turned on.  After that, it always 
        starts on high speed when the a/c is turned on.  I just finished 
        trooping out to the garage and starting it up to confirm this.  
        This happens irregardless of the cooling position I select.  If 
        yours is wrong, so is ours so I suspect the engineering is 
        different from your 86.  Is this the same condition for others on 
        the list?  Inquiring minds want to know.
        
        Concerning your gauge, 3/4 bothers me as ours has never been 
        higher than 1/2 or a little bit above it even when traveling 
        through the Smokey Mtns.  There is always the possibility that 
        our gauge is defective and yours is accurate. More input from 
        others on the list may be needed.  Temps have been high 90's to 
        low 100's this week (I checked coolant level and strength) but 
        the needle on the temp gauge has climbed very little.  Generally, 
        our gauge reads right at or a little above the 1/2 way mark.
        
        We have had only one problem with the A/C.  The rear unit quit 
        cooling just as warm weather season started.  My local dealer 
        replaced some sort of valve under warranty; he said it was a 
        common problem and that VWofA had some sort of fix for it.  We 
        did not buy the vehicle from this dealer but he has always 
        cheerfully (and competently) fixed whatever warranty problems 
        have cropped up.  We have also enjoyed your spirited defense of 
        E-Vans.  My 72 Westy has an attraction all its own but dollar for 
        dollar, pound for pound, our E-Van has been one of the best 
        vehicles we have ever owned.
        
        Hope this helps,
