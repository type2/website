Subject: Dealer parts source


I recently received a letter from a dealer in Phoenix AZ about discount
SAAB parts because of my association with NINES - the SAAB club.  By
coincidence they are also a VW dealer.  I used to order parts from them
(for SAABs) when they were Armand Verdone and always had good service.

So I called and they are willing to extend the same offer for us.
Which is 20% over their cost.  They pay shipping on the first order.

To quantify that, I just ordered:

CV boots	23.10
Accel Cable	27.00
O2 sensor	127.34
Cable Kludge (025 906 302) to fix driveability problem  74.44
(BTW I plan to reverse engineer this thing)
Clips to reattach the front rubber to my bumper that some moron tore off  0.61ea

They had all this in-stock and I felt the guy I talked to (Bill) was
VERY knowledgeable AND very interested in dealing with us.

For grins I asked the price of the factory rebuilt 2.1 and 
he wants $2100 - the markup here is very slim.  Of course the freight 
would be another $100, but may be a wash against the sales tax.

It's:  Paul Walser - SAAB, VW, Subaru
       800.876.5199  direct parts line

Do we have any folks in Phoenix that can report on this place?
