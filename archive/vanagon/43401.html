Subject: Need a Stove Knob.

Hey volks,

When I bought my 85 Westy 3 years ago, one of the gas control knobs was
broken off. Sheared off right at the surface of the retaining nut.  I have to
replace the entire gas control switch (&amp; a new plastic knob).  Does anyone
know a source for these (junk yard, maybe)?  

Oh, by the way....is there a way to tell how much propane I have in the tank?
