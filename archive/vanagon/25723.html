&gt; Well, no.  The nature of the beast (the Internet) is that every post has

Since the mail can go multiple routes the mail process at the receiving 
end should filter the pieces together and turn them into a single mail 
message.  I think that it has to be multiply sent.

&gt; I've discounted every possibility I can think of:
&gt; 1.  I'm only on the recipients list of the Vanagon list once.
&gt; 2.  I use procmail, so all mail sent to Vanagon gets put in a seperate 
&gt; folder.  Likewise, other mail lists go to seperate folders.
&gt; 3.  Personal replies that are CC'd to the list are marked as personal.
&gt; 
&gt; So I see no reason why it would be a problem on my end.

 If you put the multiple postings together with the frequent mail 
blackouts to various folks I think it has to be sendmail on the server or 
the list server program itself.  Just a guess of course.....
