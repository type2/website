&gt; letters will, at best, be quite boring to the person opening them and
&gt; reading them, and at worst, be tossed in the trash. Instead of a form
&gt; letter, take a couple extra minutes and mention why *you* want a conversion
&gt; kit. Maybe this is because your A/C is currently leaky (like mine!) and
&gt; - Scott

Any company that ignores letters from customs be they form or otherwise 
does not deserve or warrant my business period.  If VW does not want to
support me and my vehicle after it is purchased, then VW will no longer
be a company I purchase anything from.
