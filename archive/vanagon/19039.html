&gt; &gt; The last time I looked Bentleys were going for between $150,000 and $200,000
&gt; &gt; being the cheaper version of the Rolls-Royce.
&gt;
&gt;Bentleys are in no wise &quot;cheaper&quot; versions of Rolls Royces.  They are the
&gt;&quot;performance&quot; or &quot;sporting&quot; versions.  Consider the Turbo R or the new Azure
&gt;convertible ($319,000, btw).

as i was taught, the primary difference between a Bentley automobile and a
Rolls Royce automobile is that One Simply does not drive a Rolls oneself.
the Rolls is to be driven by a chauffeur.

When One wishes to drive oneself, One takes the Bentley (or the Jag-u-ar). :)
