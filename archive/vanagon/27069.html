Subject: Re: making friends with tailgaters

it was rumored that someone wrote and I cut it to this:
&gt;     People tend to drive maniacally here in San Diego, and 
&gt;     inexplicably tailgate at all times. I'm about as patient
&gt;     as the next person, but there have been a few times when
&gt;     I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
&gt;     bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
&gt;     them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
&gt;     their shorts in fear of running into me.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     I'm in the market for a bumper sticker advising tailgaters that
&gt;     tailgating will not make my car go any faster...
&gt;
&gt;     I can't decide if this is immature driving on my part
&gt;     or a good-natured effort to improve the driving habits
&gt;     of others...
I live in Atlanta GA, home of some the damn nicest people you ever would
want to meet anywhere except on the road. I am extremely conscientious about
being in the far right lane, even if it means at times being stuck behind a
stinky slow moving dump truck etc. 
But I tell you all, I am so tired of the bastards who tailgate me in the far
right lane. I am not that slow average about 55-60 on the 55mph. I too want
to get a bumper sticker that says something to the effect &quot; Trust me I am
going as fast I can&quot;. What really amazes me about the driving down here is
all these people drive like maniac so they can get to where ever they are
going and wait. So now when I am on a little two lane country road and I
have some jerk on my bumper while going up a hill I just slow it down to
about 10 mph and take forever to get up the hill, I mean why should I stress
out the engine:) very adolescent I know but the looks on hteir faces, ahh
especially when they pass me and look over adn I am just dancing away and
singing to a hot tape. I had another idea recently but it is a little
(alot?) on hte malicious side and could have definate negative karma
effects, it is to mount a little box of nails under the back bumpers on
either side and when some jerk is riding my tail, just pull the lever and
dump a pound or so of nails in his path. I do think these things up while
cruising along and saying to myself &quot;your not gonna let them get to you today&quot;.
Peace,       &quot;Now shake it, shake it Sugaree, I'll meet you at the jubilee,
Scoob         and if that jubilee don't come, maybe I'll meet you on the run&quot;
