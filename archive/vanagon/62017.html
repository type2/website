 &lt; can I clean all the contacts and spray
&gt; them WD-40 to make them more water resistant? I have had some good luck
&gt; doing this to fix similar problems with my domestic cars. 

Randy

I find WD40 to be good at displacing water from electrical components 
immediately and in the short term.  I do not think it provides any longer
term (more than a week at most) water resistance  I think it contains
wetting agents which will cause dirt (and therefore moisture) to accumulate
over a long period.   My worst experiences with water were on a '59 Mini
with the distributor behind the front grill - when it rained heavily the
Mini stopped!   WD40 would get it going but didn't help long term.   What's
the experience of other listees?
