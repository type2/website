&gt; Out of the blue, a '57 23-window has become available, and I don't know if I
&gt; should buy it or not.  Here's the scoop:
&gt; 
&gt; '57 23-window.  No major rust, has all the chrome, good canvas sunroof, the
&gt; original interior, the jail bars, even the original glass tail-lights, etc.
&gt; No engine.  It is in superb shape.  The guy wants $3500 for it.  
&gt; 
&gt; It needs a new paint job, and brake work. (And an engine.)  I do have my
&gt; tricked out 1776cc for it though.

&gt; Is this price in line with the rest of the country (excluding CA, of
&gt; course!)?

Sounds way high to me, seeing as how it needs paint and has no engine.
I would let it go, but I guess it just depends on how bad you want it...
