Subject: 91 GL Lights

Last week my daughter drove about 750 miles, all in fairly heavy rain.
During the last couple of hours, the headlights went off. They would turn
on only by holding the high beam lever up.

Has anyone figured out what might have caused this problem. I would like to
fix it before it happens again.

Thanks,

Herb
