Subject: Running Boards on a Westie Syncro
Date: Sun, 7 Jan 1996 16:28:49 -0500 (EST)

Greetings Sports Fans!!

I just returned from the car wash with my 1987 Westie Syncro.  I 
managed to get the remnants of our last ski trip off and was thinking 
about how running boards would look.  I don't think I would lose to 
much clearance if they are mounted properly.  I think it would protect 
the sides much better than the standard &quot;Drill Big Holes in the side of 
the Van&quot; mud flaps.  They might even work better than the Harry 
&quot;MacGyver&quot; Yates' specialty mud-flaps.  Check out his homepage if you 
are curious.

My questions are...

1) Has anyone mounted running boards on a Westie before?
2) What brand names should I look out for?
3) Will it look stupid?  We still want to look good you know!!  ;-)

Cheers
Tony
