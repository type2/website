&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Is there a comprehensive list of all these codes anywhere?
&gt; &gt;Could somebody kindly post it if there is?
&gt; &gt;Thanks
&gt; &gt;Richard
&gt; 
&gt; i am 99% sure there is an article by Keith Seume (sp?) aka &quot;Uncle Keith&quot;
&gt; from Volsworld over in Jolly old England. The article pertains to VIN's
&gt; M-Codes etc.I think the article is called &quot;Back to BAsics&quot; and is in the
&gt; Vanagon FAQ. Don't know the url or whatever off the top of my head, but i
&gt; am sure gerry could point you to it.
&gt; 
I couldn't seem to find it.
Any pointers from those knowledgable FAQ'ers?
