Subject: CLick Click....

Ok, after driving 250 miles and leaving the van overnight, i start it up the
next day and it makes a loud clicking which gets faster with the rpm's, even
when the car is stationary.

this was a few weeks ago and it comes and goes...it doesn't do it all the time.

I took it to the bug shop down here in pleasant blacksburg, va.  and of
course it doesn't make the noise, (this is consistant with the &quot;when you
want to play something for somebody, you will mess it up, even when you have
it down pat&quot;) im gonna get a tube and ear around when i hear the noise again.
