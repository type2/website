Subject: Re: vanagon exhaust (in STAINLESS STEEL!)

&gt; PS: anyone know if a complete 2.1 system will fit the 1.9, ignoring old
&gt; style mounts.  This would be the best startup choice, 2.1l pipes, if so.
&gt; The Syncro front pipe will likely still be NA outside dealer. grrr

I know that the syncro front pipe is &quot;bent&quot; to clear the skid bars, and a
regular Vanagon pipe won't fit, but will a syncro pipe fit on a Vanagon?  If
so, the they ought to just make them all the same to fit either.  I haven't
looked...
