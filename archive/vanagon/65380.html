Subject:      subaru engine conversion

Hello all,
My syncro van made it across the country (MD to UT) in Jan. without
incident--I had a cargo box and canoe on top that made the winds in
wyoming esp. annoying.  At time, the pedal would be floored and I could
just manage 40 mph.  Trucks I was drafting closely would pull away from
me on mild rises.

The mountains being what they are here means plenty of climbing in third
and even second gear.  My engine has almost 170kmi on it, but is still
very healthy.   In the event it needs a rebuild, I may just consider
replacing it with a subaru engine (I think the Legacy 150hp four) using
the Kenedy engr. kit.  Right now, I'm just trying to collect information
about the kit, about the install, about the engine, costs, etc.  If
anyone has info regarding re-engining a syncro please respond directly
to me.

Kit Plane and Sport Aviation magazines have many adds in them for engine
suppliers.  It seems that the subaru engine is fairly well liked in the
experimental aviation community, which speaks well for its reliability,
even though they usually downrate the installed engine.

thanks,
Fred Porter
