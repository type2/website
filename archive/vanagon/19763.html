Subject: Re: Lotsa Light


&gt;I got the light fixtures from American Science &amp; Surplus (3605
&gt;Howard St., Skokie, IL 60076.  (708) 982-0870 )  The part number
&gt;for the lights is #10572.  Cost was about two bucks.

I called yesterday and they are now sold out of these and won't have any 
more.  I suppose they have some other like items in their catalog, but they 
are sending me that also.......
