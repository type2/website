Subject: Hello to Westy owner at Amelia Island

I'm on a business trip at the Ritz Carlton on Amelia Island and there is a 
yellow Westy in the parking lot, a nice contrast from all the rental cars out 
there.  Just wanted to say hello.  I also found a nice '57 bug daily driver 
sitting in someones driveway on the main road, stopped by to say hello.  
Exremely rare where I come from (near Valley Forge, PA) to see any volkswagen 
older than '72 or so on the road.

Bryan
