Heath,

I just dug up some of the paperwork I received with my Judson
Supercharger, and here's the following quote:

&quot;Not for use on 1500 or 1600 cc engines&quot;

In looking at the specs, the Judson will put out enough pressure
to raise the air intake for a 1200 cc engine 1.5 times. Doing 
some rough math, that means you will be getting an advantage
for a 1500cc engine of 1.2 times, and for a 1600 cc engine
1.125 times. In other words, the pump will not be forcing
too much air for the 1500/1600 cc engine. Given also the
fact that the output end of the supercharger is the
size of a 1200 cc manifold, you will also have a choking
effect which will reduce the flow of air even further, sort
of like a restrictor plate in NASCAR.

You would probably be better off putting headers/larger pistons
or going some other route.

The only advice I could give you is to put in a larger main
jet...what size?? Who knows...but start with something at least
10% larger and work from there. 

Also make sure your engine's cooling system is functioning 
perfectly, and that you have plenty of air getting into
your engine compartment, as supercharged engines will tend
to run hotter than stock.
