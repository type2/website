&lt;&lt; Saw the ULTIMATE Syncro camper on Memorial Day, but didn't get to check
 it out. It was for sale, but drove off before I could talk with the
 owner-I've been waiting for it to reappear, but it hasn't yet. Anyone
 know just what it might be?? It had a Vgon nose, a high, rather narrow
 fiberglass (?) camper body, military style wheels (18'-20'), 4 WD, and a
 turbo diesel whine/clatter. An interested bystander said it was an '84
 model, the engine was Volvo, and the only name he saw was &quot;3 German
 words&quot; (Steyr Daimler Puch?). I think the asking price was $17k or $18k,
 but I can't be sure. I'll keep watch for it and post an update if it
 shows again. In the meantime, NE1 familiar with this beast?
