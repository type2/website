So MrJimmy3_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have:
&gt; 
&gt; Replaced Idle Stabilizer
&gt; Replaced Oxygen Sensor
&gt; Installed VW new wire harness to computer

Okay, now that you've played the &quot;Guess The Mystery Failing Part&quot; game
with your dealer reaping the benefits, it's time to take command of
the diagnoses yourself.

First, check the wiring carefully at the idle stablizer end.  Check
for any possible cold solder joints or excess solder connecting two
adjacent wires.  

Next, check the wiring harness at the 'black box' end and do the
same checks you did at the idle stablizer end.  

If there are know visible problems, you have to get into the black
box to check and see if there are any cold solder joints in there.
If you don't want to do this, then the only other solution is to
replace the computer.  So you may as well get in there and check
it out or put up with the hesitation.  If you have to replace 
components in the computer, I'd scour the junk yards for a possible 
replacement.  I'm not sure you can get the components any other
way.
