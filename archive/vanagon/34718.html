&gt;The haed gaskets that leak coolant on a Vanagon are entirely different than
&gt;the head gaskets on most other &quot;normal&quot; cars.  A &quot;normal&quot; head gasket (like
&gt;on a Jetta or Eurovan) does dual duty in sealing both the combustion
chambers
&gt;and the coolant passages.  The Vanagon head gaskets that leak only do the
job
&gt;of keeping the coolant inside the engine.  Compression sealing is seperate
on
&gt;a Vanagon and not generally suspetible to leaks like the coolant gasket.

Internal head gasket leaks are more of a problem than you may think.  This is
the failure that causes unexplained air in the system overheating, pooheat,
and will cause engines to blow.  Also, exhaaust gasses getting into cooling
syem cause more corrosion and the increased pressure will damage the radiator
and heater cores.  All Vanagon engines should be regularly &quot;Leakdown&quot; tested
to detect this conditon.  Especially before buying.  Ifbubbles are observed
in the main expansion tank when the engine is revved,  you probably have this
problem.  If this is not a problem and the outside leakage isnot
catastrophic, I would try cooling system stop leak. I have been very
succesful with this fix.  Sometimes, removing the heads will cause other
problems that will cost al types of money to correct.  On a high mileage
engine, it may be time to use the stop leak, and  save your money for a
rebuild.
