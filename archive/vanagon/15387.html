I think what's needed here for SweetPea (I think that's who asked the 
original question) Is how to use the meter.  So, take your sentence above 
and write it like this:
   First check the generator.  Set your VOM on scale (x) with the red 
wire in the (+) and the black wire in the (-).  Put the red wire on the 
terminal marked (x) and ground the black wire.  Start the car and run it 
at a (slow/fast/screaming) idle.  The meter should read (x).

Can someone (nothing personal here, Stuart -- just trying to help the 
original poster) post that level of description?

It's about what _I_ would need if I were doing this.
Fortunately, I just replaced the regulator :-)
