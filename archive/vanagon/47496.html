Subject: '87 Cup holders

All,

I need two cup holders for my '87 Vanagon.  These are the &quot;Flip-Flop&quot; square
version.   Any color is okay (blue if possible)  I know it is a small item
but I have kids and want to keep the interior as free as possible from spilt
drinks.  Think of me next time you go to the salvage yard.  TIA

Please E-mail direct - ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com

Thanks,
Dan
