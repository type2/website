Subject: QE: Cylinder head temp.


I have just bought a 1980 Vanagon with a fairly new 2.0l (120cu in) 
engine. One of the previous owners has installed a cylinder head 
temperature gauge (wonder why?!?).

Here my question: can anybody tell me what the normal and the maximum 
reading should be (the gauge is in Fahrenheit - unfortunately!).

Another question: I tried to unscrew the transmission fluid inspection 
and refill plug - with my limited equipment without any success. Does 
anybody have another idea besides the garage around the corner...
