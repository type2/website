Subject: It was a dark and stormy night....
Date: Fri, 5 May 95 15:28:41 PDT

Toodling along in the rain, a goshdarnhugemongous 18wheeler passed me and      
signalled to pull back into my lane.  As is my usual courtesy I flash the 
lights using the on-off switch, a common professional driver's signal.  Poke
em off, then poke em back..wait..no lights.  and it was a dark and stormy 
night.  I pulled over and did the switch thing a few more times.  Yep, no   
headlights.  Hastily rewiring the fogs to run from +12 instead of the signal
from the low beams I trundled dimly on.  

Happened to find a fine auto supply store in Bishop CA. That had a very 
similar switch and swapped in in for the paltry sum of ~$40US.  I'll report
later on the particular failure mode of the defunct switch.  Sure am glad
those fogs were there.

Into the spares box to ward off the black spells will go a tested-good/used
switch as a spare.
