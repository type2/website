Subject: Giving away my bra...

to All:
When I purchased my '87 Westy it came with a bra.  so did the '85 i 
had.  i've thrown one away in a fit of cleaning and the other is 
hanging in my gargage.  I hate them.  the '87 had damaged paint as a 
result of dirt and moisture trapped behind it.  they look cool but i 
would have to be even more anal to live with one because they should 
be taken off with each washing or rain.  in MN the weather changes 
every 15 minutes anyway so forget it.

i don't know the condition of the one i currently have... maybe some 
rotted stitching or just abuse from me ripping it off in my fit of 
anger as i saw the paint damage.  anyway it is free.  i would prefer 
to give it to someone that is going to Inuvik because there you will 
REALLY need it for protection from flying stones.  i will box it up 
and send it UPS to a worthy recipient.  you can reimburse me the UPS 
when you get it OR and i would prefer this method, just do someone a 
favor and pass on the karma.  some of you already have a surplus of 
that anyway :)

no guarantees on the condition but the price is right.
