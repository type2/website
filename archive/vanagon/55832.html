&gt; So here is the question,  I want to alter the signal from the cylinder head
&gt; temp sensor so the computer would recieve a slightly cooler reading. Would
&gt; a variable resistor work?   Are there any specs. available regarding
&gt; voltage readings?

I'm not sure why you would want to do that.  &quot;Slightly cooler reading&quot; = 
more rich mixture and you can affect that easier using the mixture 
control on the air meter.

However, I guess putting a resistor inline with the temp sensor would 
achieve the &quot;slightly cooler&quot; trick with the ECU.  Bentley says:

     Oil Temp      Meter reading
     14 deg F      7,000 - 11,600
     68 deg F      2,100 -  3,100
    176 deg F        270 -    390

so you have some reference points.
