Subject: Re: 87 Syncro CV Joint/ Spares List

&gt;| In fact, how about generating a cross referenced parts list for the
&gt;| vanagons, something to go into Coyotes FAQ site.  Nice to know that a fuel
&gt;| pump from a ???? will work in a vanagon etc...

	All of the fuel injection parts are cross referenced in the file
archives at http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/Files/ (Not sure if the
above was a reference to this or desire for such an list for the fuel parts).
Would be a good project...
