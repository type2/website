    We bought our first bus last April and were on a road trip down to
    the Oregon Coast and this guy in another westy waved at us.  This was
    the beginning of our qus..quest to propogate the VW community in our
    corner of the world... rainy Vancouver.  There are tons of vans on
    the road ehere and now we have a core of &quot;wavers&quot; whom we see
    regularily an we move about.  Its interesting to observe the
    demographic of our wavers... male,20-something (goti is best) are the
    best candidates.  Some of the female drivers have taken a while to
    wave back but I'm sure that a strange guy waving at them in traffic
    is probably something for some people to be unsure of.  Anyway, in
    our incessent attempt to find community in a TV culture, keep on
    waving !!!!

when i first drove a bus ('63 camper), other
bus owners would wave.  years passed.  now
that we are rare again, the waving has restarted.
must be a fact of human nature lurking here...
