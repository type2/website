Subject: 84, noise???

Hear is a teaser for the problem solvers. 

1.  Upon driving off a high pitched squeel, not too loud comes from what
sounds like the right rear of the car.  Maybe wheel well.  The sound stops
when the brake is applied then continues when the brake is released.  After
about a mile or so it goes away until the next time the car sits for a
little while.
        Any ideas?  
2.  Yesturday, Peggy told me that the camper did something strange.  on one
trip it hesitated three separate times.  This occured in both third and
fourth gear.  The car acted as if the gas peddle was released.  It was for
only a moment and then the car resumed normally.  
        Again ideas? 
3.  Thanks to everon who helped with the oil plug problem.  I haven't found
a complete solution yet but I'm certainly better informed.  I hate it but I
may be using the rubber plug for a while.  Anyone know where I can get the
coil incert that can be threaded in?
