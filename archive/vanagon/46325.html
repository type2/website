&gt;&lt;&lt; On another unrelated, but VW note:  I received my rear window seal that I

&gt; but did I mention that I ordered it in February?  That just broke my
&gt; personal record for longest backorder!  Oh well, at least it finally
&gt;arrived. &gt;&gt;
&gt;Very interesting, considering we just shipped over 100 of these seals to RMMW
&gt;about 3 weeks ago, because RMMW's normal supplier (Brazil) has had them on
&gt;B/O for them since last November.  Guess RMMW got tired of waiting too. (And
&gt;they paid a little more than $9.95 too!).  We're now RMMW's main supplier for
&gt;these and a few other Window Seals they've inquired about from us.  It's a
&gt;lot softer than WCM's IMHO and easier to install as well.  I've been making
&gt;these since 1976 (The Old Volks Home).  Made in USA - the only way to go :)

So if RMMW had them backordered since November I can only assume that the
reason they offered them for $9.95 in the February sale (regular price $30)
was so they could increase the volume of their pending order to get a better
price from Brazil?  I could understand them running out of an item in their
catalog and having to place it on backorder (though that happens too often
as it is), but to place an item on sale that's been backordered for three
months already with six months more backorder to go can try the nerves of
any happy go lucky VW owner.  I should say when I placed the order I was
prepared to wait for a few months since I've had this experience with them
many times before.  These days I only order from them when the price is
right and I don't need the part for a few months.
