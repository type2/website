&gt;In North Alabama, it's you's (sp?) all.  Some do not make a distinction

it's spelled: Youse-all
and it's that damned yankee (brooklyn-ese) influence, all them strange
talking furriners working out at that Hauntsville Space Center.

&gt;Don't know if things are different where Joel lives.  They're probably
&gt;all boning up on German for the Mercedes plant.  Does anyone know how to

well, we already found out that the southern germans talk different from
the northern germans. the northern ones say &quot;Auf wiedersehen&quot; when they
leave. them Stuttgarters say &quot;Auf wiedersehen, y'all!&quot; :)

&gt;say &quot;You all come back&quot; in German?

that would be &quot;Wiederkommen, Y'all&quot;.  :)

ol' Onkle Jodel

by the by, youse guys are getting it all wrong. you don't separate the
'you' and the 'all' ... they kinda blur/smear into each other. it's
Y'all .... sounds like 'yawl'. only one syllable.

see, we like to do things a little bit different. we take two words and
make them one. then we take one word and make it into multiple syllables.
notably, damn and shit. both are pronounced as two syllables:
dah-uhm.  shee-itte. like that.

y'all better study up fer that test next week. :)
