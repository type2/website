Subject: '54 RHD Deluxe Progress

        Well, I had to work this AM, so I didn't ride the party cruise down
to Vallejo - yet.  I'm gonna go down tonight and join the hard-core
festivities :)

        I did get some work done on the '54, though:  I got the rest of them
remnants of the outrigger and jacking point off the driver's side, and
welded on the inner rocker for that side.  The first new metal!
