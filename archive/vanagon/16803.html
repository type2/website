Subject: Re: New Jersey emissions law (was: Why are so many....)


Hey guys..

Don't get me wrong!  My '83 is kept as clean running as possible,
and unless I go to an expert VW mechanic who can and does open
the air regulator for that special little tweak every two years 
or so I can forever loose my Westy.  What my bone of contention
is that you have only one chance to fix the emission problem
or the car is condemed.  Imagine,  for a moment that cherry Westy
in your garage....new tranny....$3000.00 engine....new paint...
and totally useless because those emissions were off.

I'm probably jumping the gun on this issue but I fear that the old
girl may decide to commit suicide right as they stick the probe into 
the Liestritz....and those of you who own Vanagons should know 
what I mean.
