Subject: Upright engine in late model bus

Please reply directly to me as I'm not on this list, I'm posting from the &quot;
outside&quot;
I have the opportunity to purchase a '72 bus for what seems to be a
reasonable price for a bus with a full &quot;camper&quot; interior. Anyway, this bus
needs a valve job according to the owner and he was quoted 700/750 $(u.s.)
for this valve job. I have an extra type 1 1600cc engine laying around in my
garage. All I would need would be a fan shroud to make this engine complete.
Would it fit into the '72 bus ? It seems that retro fitting the less
expensive-to-repair type 1 motor into the bus rather than the expensive type
4 in there now makes more sense.
Any suggestions?

Thanks, Dan
