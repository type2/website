Subject: Westies in the Maritmes/Stats for Joel

Hi all. Having finally shaken all the vacation cobwebs out, I can now give
you the results of the Great Westy Hunt in the Maritimes. My wife, three
dogs and Siegfried, our trusty 86 syncro Westy, counted a total of 70
Westies in our time in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.
The best day was July 14, The Grand Slam of Westies !!  - 2 splits, 1 bay
window, 1 vanagon and 1 eurovan, all Westies. Whew, that was when we were
on PEI and the splits were in just awesome shape!! Most of the Westies
waved back at Siegfried, for some reason the eurovans were the most
reluctant to wave. In this tour of three weeks we also saw - 1 bay window
single cab, 1 bay window double cab, 2 vanagon single cab, 1 vanagon double
cab, 1 regular split - 21 window - awesome condition, and 1 diesel panel
eurovan. There was only one day we did not see a Westy that we had not seen
before. Quite a trip!! We ran across a guy in 72 bay window at the top of a
hill with the engine lid open. Stopped to offer help and he said his fan
belt had broken. Not having a spare for that model I asked what he would
do? Weel, he was going to Stapel the belt and go from there!! No idea how
far (if) he went! Keep a Spare Belt Gang!! Anyhow the trip was great, the
Westy was more comfortable that the motel we stayed in(can't beat indoor
plumbing) and it was wonderful to just pop the top and sleep in comfort!!
The Maritimes are just a great place and I can recommend it to all members.
Next year we plan to go up the Miramichi River Valley. More later, but I
had to get these stats to Joel for Friday!! Nice to be back.
        Mike E.
