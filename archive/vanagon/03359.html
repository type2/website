&gt;But for us &quot;mature&quot; VW types...badges??? We need no steeenkin' badges!

Si, senor, but I theenk maybe chu left ouut one word...

I theenk it was &quot;We don't need no steeenkin' badges!&quot;   :-)

(BTW, I'm in Calif., and of course I realize this is not PC, but it's getting
close to Friday, dammit Gumby, and I'm gearing up.)

Incidentally, Ric, while you were in Europe, you didn't happen to notice
any &quot;stealth&quot; type IIs, did you?
I guess a bus with no badges doesn't have quite the same effect as an
MB w/o badges, eh?
