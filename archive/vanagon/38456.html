Subject: Re: Emissions

Sorry, can't beat your emissions.  But if you give me a few days I'm 
sure I can go remove some key emission control accoutrements and maybe 
give you a run for you money.

Here in BC, they also make you have a gas cap.  Can you believe it?  Who 
are they to tell me I can't let all my gas evaporate?!  If it does, that 
means I just have to buy more gas.  That's good for the economy isn't it?
