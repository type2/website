Subject: 1973 VW Van 

For Sale:

1973 VW Van
Less than 20,000 miles on new engine.  Clutch, transmission also new with
engine.  Brakes replaced less than 2,000 miles ago.  Interior good, except
for front seats.  Back seat folds into a bed.  Great for trips, camping,
etc.  Fun car, must see.  I am only parting with it because I am heading
back East in Mid June and don't think it would be great in the snow. 
Although it would make the trip fun.  Has fridge and sink in the back. 
Lots of storage space, and some real snazzy curtains.  Excellent running
condition, paint ok.  Almost no rust.  It's been a California car all of
its life.
