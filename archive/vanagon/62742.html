Re: painting with a low priced HVLP system.

	I used a Wagner HVLP paint system last year to paint my vanagon 
with very good results.  I did mine in Jaguar British racing green 
metallic.  Paint cost was about $75.00, and the job was easy, not brain 
surgery as the rates quoted by some shops might imply.

	Points to watch:
		1)  The viscosity of the paint is critical.  Use the 	
		    calibration cup system supplied with the unit, and	
		    spray a test patch on a piece of cardboard, etc. to 
		    gauge whether it goes on flat &amp; not too runny.
		2)  I recommend staying away from hardeners in the paint
		    because of the health risk they create.
