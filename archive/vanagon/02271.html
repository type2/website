When I had to haul a heavy trailer with my little Isuzu pickup, a
mechanic suggested that I install air shocks.  Now I can go to the
air pump at the gas station and raise or lower the rear end of my
pickup perhaps 4 inches.  Maybe more...  I don't know if this is
germain to this discussion and the ones we had regarding vans which
were low in the back, but it's a thought.

The air shocks weren't too expensive; I seem to recall about $100
installed.
