Subject: Re:  Front Bunk Mounts '70 vs. '78?

&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know if the mounts from a '78 front hammock will fit in a '70 bus?
&gt;
&gt;I'm interested in buying the one Michel Heron's got for my nephew's '70 if
&gt;they do, but neither of us is certain.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe Fournier

Why don't you measure the distance between the clips across the windshield and
the pillar behind the door, and also the distance front to back?  I'd do it on
mine but I'm at work.  I was kind of wondering if the dimensions were the same
myself.
