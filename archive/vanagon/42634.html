Subject: Spindles, Lowering, etc.

I might also want to mention that the drop spindles our friendly competitors
across town is a direct knock-off of the prototype drop-spindles we did a few
years back.  Why didn't we go into production?  Doing it was really simple -
just flip the vertical king pin assemblies upside down.  But due to the
amount of &quot;meat&quot; on the spindle itself and the king pin housings, they bind
together when you turn them.  So you have to clearance them by shaving some
of that &quot;meat&quot; of of both items so that they do not bind against each other.
 Real trick, except you have allowed the strength of the entire spindle
assembly to deteriorate, thus allowing for a better chance to either snap the
spindle, king pin or both.  We're not gonna accept that liability.  In all
fairness, I would probably put them on a &quot;weekend&quot; or &quot;show&quot; bus, but never
on a daily driver bus.  And besides, if you get one of them fixit tickets,
how ya raise it back up?  Can't put yer old spindles on because ya sent the
cores to you know who for conversion for the next guy.  I still say that an
adjustable beam is the only way, the safest way to go.  To make drop spindles
safely is to make a new casting, like Jatech did for the Bugs years ago.  We
just may do that, if it is cost effective to both the customer's benefit and
ours as well.
