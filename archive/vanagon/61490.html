Subject: Rear sofa/bad installation

   To the list, 

   Subject: Rear folding sofa/bed info. needed.
  
   I have resently purchased a rear
   sofa/bed, used, for my Syncro. As we were removing it, we noticed that
   the seat back pins were located in a different postion than the 
   standard rear seat. It was easy to tell because the original pin
   holes were still located in the side interior panel, but had been
   plugged. After the removal of the side panels we found the mount
   for the pins were welded into place. It all looked as if it had
   been factory installed. Returning to my 2 Vanagons, an inspection
   of the same area showed that this welded bracket is NOT there. Does
   anyone have any insight to this? Is there an opional way to mount
   a sofa/bed?
                    Thanks for any comments to this
