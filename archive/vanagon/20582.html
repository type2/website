Hi Lee,
While I don't live near the Bus Stop (they're in Colorado Springs?) I do 
live in Northern Colorado.  I'd be happy to receive shipment from the Bus 
Stop (UPS, whatever) and then forward the rest on to you via normal, 
USnail.  If this would work for you reply to me offline of the list and 
we'll work out the rest of the details.
Jack

&gt;      here's the deal:
&gt;      
&gt;      Does anyone who live real close to The Bus-Stop feel like doing me a 
&gt;      big favour?
&gt;      
&gt;      This would be to pick the stuff up and send it via normal mail to me 
&gt;      in the UK.
&gt;      
&gt;      Anyone interested in helping out?
&gt;      
&gt;      cheers,
&gt;      
&gt;      Lee.
