Ditch the kid, keep the bus.   

Just kidding...it's probably just a fashion phase young teens go
through, and Vanagons may not be too fashionable with kids who drool
over Z's and 'stangs.  Hell, think about it...we're still talking about
flannel here (although recently the conversation did swing round to
fine leathers; maybe there's hope for us yet ;^)
