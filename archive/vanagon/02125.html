I think California would be your best bet for getting a hold of a good
running camper and the further Northeast you go, the more money could be
had for selling it back because of the no-rust factor.  The hardest part 
would be getting it smogged initially.  Ideally you would want to get one 
from someone that has already had it recently smogged so you don't have to 
go through that much hassle.
