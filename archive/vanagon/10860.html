I went to the junkyard yesterday and picked up some of those tubes
betwixt the body and the heater boxes.

Got home, hooked 'em up, but ran into a minor problem which I'll have to 
engineer around:  The diameter of the tube on body is much smaller than
the diameter of the tube from the box!

Anyway, took it for a test drive, and i wasn't getting much heat flow.
Drove for a while, getting up to speed, and looked down and saw this
huge wad of gray stuff trying to get out of the tube!  I'd had mice
and what-not in the bus, I guess, and when they moved out, they didn't
take everything with them!  Guess they lose their cleaning deposit!
I ended up with a large pile of bits of cloth, insulation, nutshells and
all kinds of other stuff on my floor!
