i personallly have had good experiences with wolfsburg west- the guy on the
phone knows what hes talking about, not just punching numbers.  they use
actual VW parts numbers for their parts too, which makes it easy to cross
reference.

ill look for some pic of correct muffler installation, and try to get em
scans,

i recently bough the whole muffler setup, muffler, cross pipe, bracket, and
tailpipes, and clamp kits,  german parts, i think it did me about $100.
  (actually it was for a friend, im too cheap to buy it, i put on  ones that
i find used)
