&gt;Hey Joel - never know you had 51 cousins.  Why didn't you
&gt;tell us your parents were so closely related?
&gt;

&gt;Overheard at a West Virginia wedding:
&gt;&quot;Well! If she isn't good enough for her family...&quot;

&gt;&gt;From this yankee's understanding of the situation, the only way
&gt;you can become a citizen of the grand and glorious state of
&gt;Alabama is to prove your family tree extends no further than to
&gt;your brothers and sisters.

well, i can see that it befalls me to publicly defend the Honor of The South
once again, seeing as how these furriners cannot read or comprehend what is
written in plain english.

i have 51 First Cousins. my mother came from a family of 11 children. my
father came from a family of 13 children. all but one in each family married
and bred like rabbits. for the morbidly curious, the one in my father's side
who never married was killed in world war I. the one on my mother's side was
so ugly and mean (a high school teacher) that no one ever asked her.

no one in the family ever married a brother or sister. that kind of stuff
doesn't happen in alabama. it's been agin the law for 160 years. can't even
marry your first cousin. has to be at least a third cousin or beyond.

so there. :P
