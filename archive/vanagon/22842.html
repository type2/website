Subject:       Propane

Hello Ron.  You've hit a nerve in asking about driving with the 
propane on.  The answer is *no*!!  Please don't.  

If anything ever happened (heaven forbid) and the propane line was 
ruptured, you would be setting things up for an awful explosion that 
could kill/mame a lot of people near the van.  Propane is very safe 
as long as basic safety rules are followed.  

I know that many people on the list do run with their propane on, but 
it's pretty risky IMHO.  The fridge has a 12 Volt mode, that's what 
it's for.  I put a couple of those small lunch box size ice packs in 
the freezer compartment, and that keeps the fridge temperature cool 
in hot weather on long drives.

The propane valve should be *off* except when when parked and using 
the gas appliances.

Harry.

&gt; Is driving with the fridge on 'gas' okay?  I was told by the propane guy
&gt; that I should always have my valve turned off while driving.
&gt;
