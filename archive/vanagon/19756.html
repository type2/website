&gt;Well?
&gt;Should those of us in Southern Ontario/Western New York/Eastern Michigan
&gt;get together for a camp-out?
&gt;
&gt;I think that it would be great fun for us Great Lakes area lenti folks
&gt;to get together.  I have lots of info on Turkey Point Provincial
&gt;Park (Gobble gobble), if you're interested let me know.
&gt;
&gt;Come on folks.  Lets get it together.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers

Hey, it might be a little far from Harrisburg, PA, but I'll try to make it. 
(Do I have to bring any magnesium?)    :-)
