Subject: Revell/Germany plastic Vanagon models

Hey, Joel!

If that Vanagon fire truck you ordered really turns out to be a double-cab,
then I think I have spotted another variation for you...

A local hobby store has a Revell/Germany VW Bus ELW kit, number 7330 (but
without the 'H' you listed).

The box has photos of the prototype, not the model, and this is a
passenger Vanagon, not a double-cab.  Looks like it has Multi-Van type
seating, with the center seats facing the back.  It has some light
equipment inside (fire extinguisher, etc.), and a loudspeaker/emergency
light on the roof.  Decals for &quot;various versions&quot; are included.
Also promised is an operating sliding door, a rear hatch that can be
assembled open or closed, and a detailed 2.0L 70hp engine.  This last thing
is strange, as the photo definitely shows a radiator on the front, though
it is body-colored (red) instead of the usual black.  Was there ever a
2.0L 70hp water-cooled Vanagon engine - waterboxer or diesel?????

The box has a copyright date of 1988 on it - maybe Revell has recycled the
7330 number for a different version???  This is being called a &quot;fire
department control vehicle&quot;.  The price is $32, so you are getting a good
deal from the WV folks.

This store also had a large scale 51/52 Beetle (Kafer) and a similar-sized
Karmann Ghia.  They also had some 1/24 &quot;California Coolin'&quot; splitties,
with those excellent, rad, bitchen, sano wheel cutouts, side air scoops,
etc., etc.

Good luck on your quest for a 1:25 (and 1:1) double-cab!
