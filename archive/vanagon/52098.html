Subject: Snow Traction Devices?

 VanBondo's obligatory smart aleck comment of the week:
(You gotta admit that I have been next to lurking lately)

Vince was asking about snow traction devices:

This reminds me of the bumper stickers that were half way prevalent a few
years ago. It read &quot;No Fat Chicks&quot;. Maybe they got it wrong! I have found
most to be great fun and companions, provide an alternative to the &quot;no
heater&quot; problem and provide great traction! If they can sing then you can
also avoid the threat of stereo theft! No appologies for the non-pc thing.
I'm just not into it today...

Otherwise drive slower, lower the air pressure, and/or buy a SyncroWesty!
