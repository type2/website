Subject: Re: fuel guage question... and where did reverse go?

&gt;&gt;/Here's a quick question. Why does my fuel guage look funny. It doesn't go
&gt;&gt;/to scale. Or does it?
&gt;
&gt;What's a fuel guage? :-)

it's that little needle on the far left that bouces back and forth and
entertains me on long trips as it dances its happy little idiotic dance..
every once in a while offering chancy wisdom on the miles i can go before i
have to spend money i don't have.

	BUT on a more immediate and serious note.
Reverse is no longer one of my gear choices in my 73 bus.  I'm assuming
this means a linkage or shift coupling problem (the tranny has been good to
me so far.. no popping out, no grinds etc).  
	I have absolutely no experience with type of problem and have no
idea what to look for or adjust (i did take a long look at it but didn't
see any obvious scars).  The shifting positions did seem a little more left
of center than before but that's the only change i can feel. 
	Any suggestions before i take it in somewhere? I'd like to
conserve cash since i have absolutely none :)
