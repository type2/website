&gt; How does one measure the HP (horsepower, not hewlett-packard:-)) put out by
&gt; an engine, I have a 1600dp engine, with a few mods(lightened flywheel, etc.)
&gt; and I am interested in what the output is.

Two ways to do it.

1.  Have the engine measured on a dynamometer (a.k.a. dyno).

2.  Weigh the car, and take it to the drag races.  Use your quarter
mile ET and MPH with one of the following formulas:

BHP = (0.00426 * MPH) **3  * weight
        HP = (MPH / 234)^3 * Weight
        HP = Weight / (ET / 5.825)^3
        ET = Cubed root of (Weight / HP) * 5.825
       MPH = Cubed root of (HP / Weight) * 234

(I haven't checked these formulas for accuracy - I pilfered them from
another list and haven't tried them yet cause I don't know what my
Mustang weighs.)
