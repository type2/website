Subject: Re[2]: Carat dash clock source?


     I'm going to look into the idea that the clock module may be the same 
     as that found in the more common 85 and up Golf.  My friendly 
     neighborhood parts guy says that if the Vanagon clock module has a 
     part number that begins with 191 or 176, it should be able to be 
     substituted by the Golf/Jetta.
     
     Has this solution been pursued on the list before?

The clock in my '91 Westie was not correctly set, and pushing inside 
those two little holes weren't changing anything, even after trying with 
a mechanical pencil. So I took the dash cover out, and disconnected the 
clock's wire for the amount of time it was off. (Luckily it was only 
about an hour). The trick here is to reconnect exactly at the specific 
time needed. It worked for me.
