Subject: '81 Vanagon7P  FS Phx, Az, USA

'81 Vanagon for sale in Phoenix, AZ. It is two toned blue under powder blue.
Seven passanger style with middle and rear seat. A/C and 2.0 liter
aircooled. New tires. Will have new tune-up, battery,  and brake adjustment
(if not all new brakes) by the time that it ready to roll. It has zero rust
outside of very slight surface in the gutters. This is expected to rubout or
be a easy detail fix.  Absolute  zero body damage. Great factory paint and
glass. The main deck  carpet is a little dry rotted and currently is missing
the interior panel for the sliding door. Recent PO is looking in the shed
for the door panel for me. Otherwise the interior (including headliner) is
in excellent condition.  
I am basically helping an old college acquaintence who has a kid or two
ready for college. It is available and will go for the $2500-$3000 range
&lt;obo&gt; depending on the work that is done to it before it rolls out. The
fixes could be done at a dealership in one day. I will do them at home over
a weekend or two. It will be a very solid cross country runner by the time
it goes away.
