Subject: Welcome Message change

The following text has been added to the welcome message.

To retrieve the entire welcome message send the message
GET VANAGON .WELCOME
to listerv_at_med.umn_dot_edu

====
Due to the volume on the Vanagon list and the multigenerational nature of
the discussions, it would be a great help if you would make the subject of
your message explicit to what model(s) and year(s) or era of van that the
message pertains to. For example:

   &quot;Eurovan rear hatch won't latch&quot;   &quot;91 Camper stove problem&quot;
   &quot;87 Syncro Clutch Problems&quot;        &quot;83-H20 engine temperature&quot;
   &quot;Loafer headlights&quot;                &quot;72 Engine Timing&quot;
   &quot;Splittie Heater Question&quot;         &quot;61 paint colors&quot;

Often messages refer to trips, tools or other general topics.  These types of
messages are of course meant for the whole list and a subject without a
particular van type is expected.

It would also help to limit your post to one primary topic and split up
different subjects into different messages.

Thanks for your help in this matter!

Thanks to Jim Davis (syncrohead_at_aol_dot_com) for his help in drafting this 
reminder.
