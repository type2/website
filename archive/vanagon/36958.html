Subject: RE: Vanagon towing HEAVY loads



&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had experience towing heavy loads (1 ton or more)
&gt; repeatedly for long distances, and has it had any dire consequences
&gt; on
&gt; the VW engine or transaxle?

A few years ago, I drove my '80 Vanagon from Washington, DC to Atlanta, 
GA (500+ miles) and towed a VW Bug back. I assume the weight of the Bug 
has to be around 1800lbs or so. The Van ran great, but long uphills were 
best attacked with a running start. I would accelerate up to 80mph or so 
on the downhills, and be doing about 45 to 50mph at the top of the next 
hill.

The best part of the whole trip was near the bottom of a hill just North 
of Atlanta. I was going full out to get my speed up, and had just started 
up the first mile of a LONG hill. I was in the left lane doing a little 
over 70mph, and I passed another Vanagon doing approx 60mph in the #2 
lane. The look on that driver's face as I passed him, with the Bug in 
tow, was priceless.

A few months after that, I drove to Newark, NJ and picked up 2 Chevy V-8 
engines (new, on pallets) and a few bare V-4 OMC Outboard blocks. I had 
removed the middle seat, and had one engine there, and another on top of 
the engine. Talk about a leap of faith! If the Van engine needed 
attention, there would have been no way for me to get it!!! Once again, 
no problems!

Gotta love these Vanagons!
