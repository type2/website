Subject: Sudden Engine power loss

Help. 

While dirving at highway speed my 89 Westy will suddenly loses power for 
2-3 seconds. After the lurch the engine runs fine the rest of the trip. 
 This symptom happens occasionally- say three times in a month. Its 
taking away the fun on driving.  

Does any one have any ideas?
