Since I have been discovered, I'll intoduce myself.

Currently in the Wannabus status,  but I must say that I Haddabus, 1967, 
for several years while I was living in San Francisco, CA.  I drove it 
everywhere, including the Mojave (without ac in summer) with only minor 
problems.  It was truly a joy.  Biggest mistake of my life was letting 
it get away.  Right now I'm interested in a Westy, but just haven't 
found the right one.

Its a pleasure to see so many people interested in buses.
