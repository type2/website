&gt;Third, since the brake lights and turn signals are separate, I will need
&gt;some kind of adaptor to hook up my little boat trailer lights, since the
&gt;brake and turn signal are the same filament on the trailer.  Has anybody
&gt;made one?  Seems like diodes could work.  If not, where can I get one?

You're right. Diodes will do the job perfectly. Or you can go to your local
FLAPS and pick up a trailer light wiring adapter. It comes complete with a
sealed unit containing the diodes you need and a standard (non electric
brake) trailer plug. You simply hook up both turn signals and brake light
to the input and you will get out a flashing brake light for a turn signal.
Wire the ground and tail lights straight thru. By the way, there is a right
and wrong for the 4 wire harness, white = ground, yellow = left, green =
right and brown = tail light. HTH
