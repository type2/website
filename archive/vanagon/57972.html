Subject: syncro camper valuations getting accurate

For a long time, syncro campers have been selling for, like, $18,000 but the
used car guides have been showing the value as $10,000 or so.

This creates a problem in case of an accident, because your insurance
company would total your car out and write you a check for $10,000 if the
vehicle sustains more than $8,000 in damage. We have an interest in seeing
the real trading value get into the official price guides.

Now, however, I noticed today that www.intellichoice_dot_com is valuing my 90
syncro camper at $18,950, so this is a hopeful sign. After adjustments for
options (like alloy wheels) and for mileage, they actually list its value as
$21,000, not far from the $23,300 I paid for it.

Horray!
