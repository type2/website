I just read this in the Greensboro, NC paper:

Volkswagen Westfalia '91 Camper, 10 CD Player, CC, AC, auto, awning, EC,
$15,500. 910 373-0929

I can go look at it if anyone is interested.

&gt; &gt; You can buy one of these for around $6 from Delta 6, so it might not be
&gt; &gt; worth all of that effort.  (See http://www.vanagon_dot_com/vendors/ for
contact
&gt; &gt; information.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just bought one from them, for $8.50 + 1.25 S &amp; H.  Actually, they are
&gt; not called Delta 6 anymore, it is now Euro American RV Products. They
&gt; also sent me a couple of pages with all their Westfalia stuff. The cover
&gt; fits perfectly.
