Subject: Wanted 89 Vanagon 4spd from low mileage


Well... I inspected and tried to adjust the linkage, but the problem 
persists.

Has anyone recently done some investigation on auto salvage yards that have 
vanagons in stock within the vicinity of New York/New Jersey?

I am specifically looking for a 4 speed with a tranny code ACW (Type 091/1 
per the Bentley book).  Can anybody hook me up with some leads within a 
reasonable driving distance from New Jersey?  What should a junker trans 
cost?

I might also consider having the trans I have now rebuilt, but Joel scared 
me to death with his trans rebuild story.  Would anybody have the name of a 
shop they know has rebuilt a vanagon trans, which has the tools, and 
consistently performs long lasting repairs in a nice clean shop in the New 
Jersey area?

Thanks as always,
Peter
