Subject: FS  1983 'L' Diesel, upstate NY

     Well its official.
     
     I am putting 'Blue-Bus' on the block - I hope someone on the list has 
     a good home for her.
     
     She's a 1983 7 seater 'L' model, 85k miles, well maintained, and no 
     rust. 
     
     Asking $2750 - ill sit onthe price for a few months if i dont get any 
     offers but will be more pliable this fall, if you want to hang out.
     
     I have some pictures - if you are serious give me a call and ill shoot 
     a roll of film with whatever turns you on (some limitations apply:-)
