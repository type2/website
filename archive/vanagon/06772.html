&gt; 	Been a good week for my bus!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Tuesday I finally wrapped my mitts around a 3rd-brake-light engine
&gt; lid!  YESS!  I also got a crank-start apron.  For the uninitiated, the
&gt; early busses, like to '57 (methinks) had a crank start option.  The rear
&gt; apron has a slot in it for the crank to go thru.  I don't know how well

 Thom,

 Your refer to that rectangular light in the engine lid as a third brake light.
 When I was just a kid, we had a '56 microbus. It had the center light that 
 you refer to - It was the ONLY brake light. The outboard lights which
 were quite small, maybe 1 1/2 inches in diameter, were turn signals only. It 
 had those cool looking &quot;bullet&quot; turn signals in the front. I think that other
 buses I saw back then that didn't have the central brake light, had outboard
 circular, flat lenses about 2 inches in diameter (the ones on our '56 were
 kind of bulbous).

 Good luck with your project!
