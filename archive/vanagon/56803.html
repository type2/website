&gt; Vanagonuts,
&gt; 
&gt; A couple weeks ago I watched an episode of the TV show JAG.  It was set in
&gt; Ireland and had considerable footage of a fairly late model Vanagon
&gt; (Transporter there?) which was right hand drive.  You'd expect RHD in Ireland
&gt; I suppose, driving on the left hand side of the road and all, but what was
&gt; really odd was that the single sliding door was also on the RIGHT side!
&gt;  Really odd!  Did anyone else see this?
&gt; Has anyone else seen this odd arrangement elsewhere?
&gt; 

Okay, so I was watching Terminator II: JD and during the part where
the kid is telling Arnold that he needs to call his step-parents to
warn them about the other Terminator, I noticed in the background
that a vanagon goes by on the street.  

Okay, so I need help.  I notice these things....  

......No I'm not going to see a psychiatrist.....
