Subject: Re: Good compression, blue smoke?

&gt;
&gt;Oil leaking into your combustion chamber from the heads, probably around
&gt;the valve guides.  How much oil do you go through?  One quart every 1000
&gt;miles? 500 miles? 250 miles?
&gt;
&gt;Wolf

Please elucidate, Wolf, as to what the cure would be to stop 
said leakage around the valve guides.  Replace?  $$?
Danke.   --Ralf  (btw, apropo of nothing, but my name too is 
derived from 'wolf')
