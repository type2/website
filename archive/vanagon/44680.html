Subject: 84 Fuel Pump (was stranded in LA..)



I have been having problems with fuel supply (I think) for about 2 months now.
The van has an intermittant missfire which occasionaly stops the engine.
I changed the fuel filter and thought I had fixed it for about 60 miles
until it came back.  Then I thought it was water in the fuel because it
seemed to stop when I used gas dryer.  Lastly I swapped out the fuel
pump with another that I had lying arround.  The symptom has not
come back for about 600 miles but the &quot;new&quot; pump is making some wierd noises.
It sounds like there are air bubbles going through it. In fact if I look 
at the fuel filter I can see air bubles inside of it on the pump side.  Is
this normal, does it imply a suction leak (no gas leaks out), is the pump
leaking air into the fuel, should I try to get rid of it (difficult)?
Any ideas?

Thanks
