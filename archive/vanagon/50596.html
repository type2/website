Subject: Westy part wanted-table related

     
     My rear table on an '85 westy has been flopping around a bit and I found 
     that the nylon insert that fits into the bottom table support 
     bracket(inside the small cabinet door) has disintegrated.
     
     Does anyone have any replacement experience, (i.e., availability, price, 
     anyone with one they would like to part with, kluge, etc.), with this item?
     
     Thanks,
