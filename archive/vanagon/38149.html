Subject: Re: One-piece exhaust for '78 Transporter?

Jay,

I've haven't painted an exhaust myself, but whenever somebody paints
an exhaust on the list, they report that the paint just comes off and
smells bad. You can check the archive at:

 http://www.oden.se/~fh/TVWA.HTML

to confirm this. I use to be on the aircldvw list and they use to talk
about an aluminum coating or something for the exhaust. Whatever the
coating was, it cost a lot.

FWIW,
