Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)



I have an idea on how to deal with outfits like busboys, etc....

Is it possible to get a &quot;collection&quot; of the bus boys traffic that has gone 
on this list lately, and first off &quot;sanitize&quot; the individual e-mail messages 
by dropping off the e-mail addresses and anyother personal identifiers.

Next we take a copy of Joel's weekly list. To that we add a letter that 
basically says: &quot;there has been a bunch of negative traffic regarding your 
product/service. It is obvious that you have a practice of ignoring 
individual customers, requests, etc. Can you afford to ignore such a large, 
world-wide group of potential consumers?&quot;

I would also CC copies of the packet to VWTrends (T&amp;A) and DBHVWs....

Just a suggestion....sort of guerilla warfare against a$$holes.
