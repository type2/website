Hey all,
I just have a few quick questions.

&gt;1) Is it possible to replace the valve cover gaskets on a '78 2.0L with the
&gt;enginei n the bus?

Yes, just pry off the retaining bar with a screwdriver, and a little force
and replace, use the same screwdriver, and force to replace.


&gt;2) Is it possible to replace the pushrod tube seals with the engine in.

Yes, just remove the valve covers, and pushrods, see Muir, Bentley, or
Haynes for the procedure. It shouldn't be all that hard, just awkward
working under the engine.

&gt;3) I imagine it's completely out of the question to replace the oil cooler
&gt;gaskets with the engine in, at least not without a LOT  of disassembly.

It can be done.  You need to remove the fan housing.  To do that start
removing the screws that hold the fan in place, remove the fan belt, remove
the alternator, remove the engine tin, and the fan pulley. Don't forget
to disconnect the thermostat, the connection is on top of the fan housing
next to one of the flaps assemblies. Reverse your steps to assemble.

&gt;4) brakes.  I read with interest kyle's description of a failing master
&gt;cylinder.  &lt;snip for brevity&gt;

Sounds like air in the system. If you have bled the brakes and are sure
you got all the air out, there must be a leak in the master cylinder, check
the seals etc, also check you wheel cylinders.  Also check your vacuum lines
for leaks.

&gt;5) brake-related:  does the rear hub nut (that god-awful big one) have to be
&gt;removed to remove the rear drums?  There are two bolts threaded into the drums
&gt;in between lug nuts, are these for removal, i.e., turn bolts in and drum pops
&gt;off?  The 4Runner has a setup exactly like that.

Not sure, sounds like you just need to remove the bolts, but someone
else should help you there.


Hope this helps.
