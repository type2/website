Subject: Re: VW Alloy Wheels

&gt;Is there any problem with or adjustment needed when putting standard VW
&gt;Westfalia Alloy wheels on a VW that came with steel wheels? 

NOPE.

I assume you'll be using the VW Vanagon 5 spoke &quot;Carat&quot; alloys off your burned
westy, or some other Van that had the 5 spoke &quot;Carat&quot; alloys. 

-Get the alloy wheels
-Get the alloy wheel lug nuts and lug bolts

THATS IT. 

THEY BOLT RIGHT ON. 

&gt; I was assuming that
&gt;this would be 'easy'

It is easy.

&gt; but discussion on this list has me nervous now!

Gee. I wonder who that was.....
