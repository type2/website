Subject: Still no idle

Hi People: Thanks for the advice on the problem w/85 westy not idling..
try everything and it seemed to help....after talking to Jo (owner of
unit and girl friend) found out she has never had unit tuned up...
tonight will do the plugs, cap, rotor thing...do you time like a
airhead? Don't have book yet....I found timing mark on pully but don't
know what to reference to while using timing light.....
TIA....Doc
