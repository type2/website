Ken &amp; Sharron,

Its hard to explain to a non-VW owner the relationship VW owners
have with their vehicles.  There is a historical part for many
of us that goes back to when VW had a significant market share
and most all the owners seemed to have a similar philosophy of
life.  

The driver of every beetle or bus you would meet on the road
would smile and wave back as you passed each other.  Much of
that is lost now, since VW is marketing to yuppees and
yuppee-wanabees.  Old time VW owners could barely afford the
car.  They could only dream of expensive mountain bikes or fancy
skis tied to the top of the car.

So why do we &quot;bare all&quot; on this list and tell all about our
leaking heads and stalling engines?  Can't speak for everyone,
but for me keeping 'em running is the fun part.  (Another way of
saying, if you can't work on 'em maybe you shouldn't own 'em.)  

Anyway VWs are just as reliable as any other vehicle.  It's just
that we have a forum to talk about the problems.  Besides, a
good parent is always toughest on their own kids and we think of
our VWs as members of the family.

Being an artist and writer are two points in your favor.  Sounds
like you guys may have the right mental attitude to own a VW. 
You may be receptive enough to pick up on the VW karma.  Sorry,
no lawyers allowed. :-)

&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; I subscribed to this list a week ago in order to help my wife
and I make
&gt; some decisions regarding which avenue to take on our future
travel plans.
&gt; We are intending to take a little drive around Canada (maybe
the U.S. too if
&gt; we're desperate for sunshine)for a year within the next 4 to 6
months.  We
&gt; would be doing this on an artist(me)/writer(wife) budget which
should make
&gt; it more interesting but also limiting in some ways.  Our first
choice in
&gt; vehicles has been a Vanagon but I'd like some realistic
opinions from you
&gt; people:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.- reading my mail I see lots of mention of new engines,
costly repairs,
&gt; oil leaks, lack of power, stalling, and furnaces.  Are these
the exceptions
&gt; or the rule.  I realize that there are about 500 people on
this list so
&gt; maybe my apprehension is unwarranted. 
&gt; 2.- is the size of a Vanagon going to be too confining over
that length of
&gt; time?  
&gt; 3.- would we be wiser looking at some other R.V.(haven't seen
any that
&gt; appeal) considering our limited budget or is the Vanagon going
to do the
&gt; job? 4.- it is obvious that you really like your VW's.  Are
they really good
&gt; or do your biases help you do overlook some of their
drawbacks.
&gt; 
&gt; Look forward to the responses.
