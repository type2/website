Subject: VW Rialta's FS (2)

A local RV dealership just got in 2 &quot;new&quot; (not pre-owned) VW Eurovan Rialta
motorhomes, a '96, and a '97 model. The '97 has the VR6 and the '96 has the
Audi inline 5.
These are the motorhomes built by Winnebago on the extended VW Eurovan
chassis. 
I looked at them out of curiosity as I've never been inside one before, and
they are quite comfortable.
They're LOADED. Yeah, just a few more amenities than a Westy....  :&lt;)
Here's a list of some standard features:
generator
a/c
full kitchen and microwave
TV
VCR
real tiolet (you don't have to carry this one out and dump it behind a
tree..)
shower
2 twin beds
and so on..

I've actually clocked one of these at nearly 80mph FWIW....

They are at: 
All Seasons RV
Easton, Pa
(610) 253-7700
