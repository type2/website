&gt;  I
&gt;was also thinking of having another 'Live chat nite' on The Undernet
&gt;#Volkswagen, March 22nd.  Please let me know if your interested.  Take
&gt;care.

The last chat was a helluva lot of fun. Count me in. It was worth 
figuring out Homer (my IRC client) to get into the chat. 
Is there a best time for left coasters (US) or others to join the chat?
