I flush our hydralics(clutch and brakes) at least once every two
years.Proably sooner. It is cheaper than replacing cylinders.

&gt;     I've noticed a tendency for the '91 to develop what I'll call soft
&gt;     brakes after a few moderate-to-heavy applications.     I am
somewhat suspicious that someone some time may have put DOT3   brake
fluid in instead of DOT 4, so I plan on going to the mess and    trouble
to flush the system.
