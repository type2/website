&gt;&gt;  &gt; The reasoning is simple: Remember

&gt;typewriters
&gt;&gt;  &gt; that eventually they would type out the entire range of
&gt;Shakespearean
&gt;&gt;  &gt; sonnets?  Well by the same logic 400 of us (or whatever the heck
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;  &gt; numbers are) are bound to collectively produce something
&gt;intelligent
&gt;&gt;  &gt; eventually. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Um, no, sorry.  Look at Usenet: going strong for almost 15 years
&gt;with hundreds 
&gt;&gt; of thousands of monkeys and hasn't produced anything intelligent
&gt;yet!
