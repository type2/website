Subject: Re: folding cot search

&gt;Anybody know where I can get the folding cot mechanism that bolts on
&gt;the roof, under the fiberglas top of a '71 westfalia?
&gt;
&gt;I'm still holding out hope that I can repair my westy, but finding
&gt;parts is going to be tough.

There's one sitting in my parents' garage. I bought the pop-top off a 
wrecked US-spec camper but never fitted the cot. The bad news is its in 
Manchester, England. If anyone wants it they're welcome to it.
