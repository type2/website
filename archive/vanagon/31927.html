Subject: RE: Rt 66


&gt;Someone was looking for Rt. 66 info.  Check out Autoweek's web site.
&gt;Someone has a &quot;Chicago to LA&quot; page that looks most detailed.
&gt;Didn't catch the address, but got there through a CERN search on
&gt;&quot;Auto&quot;.  Hope that it has what you're looking for.


That was me, and maybe others?

By now, I've been there and done a little of that, though I wish I'd
had more time. Flew from San Diego to Springfield, MO, bought and fixed
up (somewhat) the V6anagon, and drove it back to Sandy Eggo over the
weekend of Dec. 1, 1995. Followed the Mother Road from Springfield to
Flagstaff, AZ, then cut south and west to SD.

This trip should never be done with less than a week's time available
for sightseeing. I drove by tons of stuff I would have liked to stop
and check out.

I chronicled the drive, and can send copies if anyone isn't sick of
hearing me blab already. I'll probably put it in a Web page someday,
if I ever get one, along with pictures of the V6anagon, its engine,
radiator, et. al.

I just looked for the page you mentioned, and found it under:
