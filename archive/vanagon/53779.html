Kenyon--

When dealing with insurance companies, it has been my experience that
you must be firm, persistent and say the word &quot;lawyer&quot; often.  They will
almost NEVER give you blue book.  They claim that that is a 'national
average' and they only offer 'local value' which they themselves compute
(convenient, huh).  A few years back, a guy crossed the median and
totalled my car.  I had boughten it used for $6500 6 months before the
accident.  Insurance company started off offering $3500 and 'maxed out'
(after 2 weeks of argueing) at $4200 at which point I flat out refused
and told them that they would be hearing from my attorney.  About 30
minutes later, I received a phone call from them offering $5500 (blue
book at the time--regional edition--had it at $6200).  Considering that
I had put 25K miles on it in the 6 months that I had had it, I was
satisfied with this offer and settled.

Have you considered buying it back from the insurance company after you
settle?  They will usually sell it back for $50-$100 so they don't have
to deal with the salvage--and they don't get much for it anyway from the
salvage yards.

Good luck and remember--be firm &amp; persistent.  Know what you will accept
and stand by it.  And mention lawyer!  Just saying the word makes them
quiver!
