&gt; housing is at least the diameter of the rest of the duct, and the air does
&gt; not have to turn a corner as it would with a squirrel cage.  I wouldn't want
&gt; to have to run the fan all the time, and I don't.  Not that a Vgon is quiet
&gt; enough at 70+ so you'd NOTICE one extra fan.

I didn't use a squirrel cage fan, but a &quot;turbine&quot; fan from a gas heater.
The air flow is straight through, and I guess the fan blade did freewheel
with the stock air flow, but I do beleive it impeded the flow. Don't get
me wrong, I think the inline blower is a great idea, I just didn't carry
it through to the end, ie. external mounting, insulation, proper rheostat
control. I still have the blower if anybody is interested.
