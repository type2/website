I'm sorry to waste the bandwidth, but I have to give Ric a public salute.

Ric,    You're great!
Don't ever leave this list.

&gt; My family DO NOT litter. However, every chance we get, I pull the van
&gt; over to the side of a road next to a bill board....send the kids out with
&gt; spray cans to paint funny faces and obscenities on bill boards all the
&gt; while I proudly uninate into on comming traffic!!  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sheeesshhh...couldn't the makers of the commercial use Chrysler 
&gt; shitboxes??? We ALL know who rude owners of those vehicles can be!!  8-)
