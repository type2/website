Subject:       Re: 87 synchro problem


&gt; My 87 synchro periodically will develop hesitation in the engine after
&gt; running for 20-30 minutes at highway speeds (3600-3800 rpms). It doesn't do
&gt; it all the time . If I stop for 10 minutes or so and then resume the voyage
&gt; everything is fine for 20 minutes or so then the same thing happens or it
&gt; runs perfectly for hours! It is driving me crazy! Seems to do it only in
&gt; weather 50 degrees or less.  Anybody gotta clue about this?

Sounds like the dreaded loose resistor in the computer problem that 
the accessory harness was supposed to patch. See the service bulletin 
no. 90-01 in the file:

(According to Don Lancaster, this can also be fixed by taking your 
computer apart and resoldering the offending part. Don, did you ever 
get that file on Genie reposted to one of the Volkswagen servers? 
Hint-hint!   :-)) (Hmmm, makes me look like a double chin)
