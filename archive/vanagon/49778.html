Subject: CCC Mammoth Trip Thanks!  :-)
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

Hi everybody!

Just thought I'd take a minute to thank everybody who made it to the 
Mammoth CCC Trip. It was really fun - even the magnesium roast!

:-)

It was great to have Dave and Joel drive for *DAYS* just to be with us. 
It was a pleasure to meet the two of you.

It was good to see our pals who we met on the Sequoia and to meet so 
many new (to us) CCC's. We thought it was pretty cool to have 
passers-by just stop in to talk VW.

Mark and I are very pleased that you liked our little spot and we're 
glad that you all found something fun to do on Saturday - The Devils 
Postpile and Rainbow Falls are always a hit - but probably not as 
impressive as the free *HOT* showers. (oooooweeee)

I think the best part of the whole trip was having the entire place to 
ourselves! It really gave us space to do our thing!

I'm about to hit the Mammoth Winter Travel Planner to find us a BIG 
cozy - funk mo place to do a winter trip. I'll keep everybody posted on 
that.

Well, thanks again for coming!

:-)
