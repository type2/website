Subject: new bus - meat wagon



hey all

so I found yet another bus.  This is only a temporary replacement of the 61.
  I'm not that into commercial vehicles, but I couldn't pass it up.

It's a 63 delivery van with double doors on both sides.  It's painted red
with a logo   Heissman's Meats on both sides.   It was used till 67 when the
company went out of business and the bus was parked in a garage. Only 65,000
on the odometer,  but the motor's gone.  It even has the hardboard cab
divider still in it.   I'm going to see it tomorrow,  and probably get it, if
it looks like the photos.   

Then it'll get some MEAT IS MURDER type bumper stickers......
