Subject:      Good head-s?

I'm replacing the heads on my '76 westy and have been doing some digging
about the steallite vale seat problem. I'm getting a bit confused about
the new vs.. rebuilt heads. Ron Salmon at Bus Depot says his rebuilds
don't drop seats period. I've heard that AVP rebuilds are not a good
investment. Someone else said that if the seats are installed with a
0.014 press (heated head) - they won't come out, etc, etc. 2 new heads
cost around 150 dollars more than rebuilds - not a lot, I agree but,
just because they're new does not mean they can't drop a seat. Mine were
new (original) and did! - Why pay $150 for a luke-warm feeling?
Any suggestions?

Also, can anyone give me advise on installing hydraulic lifters while I
have the &quot;mouse wheel&quot; out. - Is it worth it? Do I have to open oil
passages, install a bigger oil pump? Should I send the block out to a
pro?
Sorry for all the questions at once - overflowed I spoze
