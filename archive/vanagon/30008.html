Subject: diesels...wusupwitdat?

Are all, or mst diesels in older buses really that weak?  I would like to 
hear the pro and con when it comes to buying a bus with a diesel motor.  
I have to admit that the rumble rumble of those motors sounds really 
neat.  I was told that they are very underpowered. Is this true...diesel 
people pleeeeeze tell me some positive experiences with these motors?!  
AND JUST TO KEEP my feet on the ground, all you gas people mail yer 
messages in too.  thanks 

jimbo and vanless
