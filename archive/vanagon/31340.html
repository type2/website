Subject: exhaust for stock motor

Hi busers,

My current exhaust is going to need to be replaced soon.  It's
some kind of 4-into-one header thing with a generic looking
muffler, and rust is winning the battle with it.  I've taped
up a few holes but know the end is near.

Do these types of exhaust really offer a big advantage over
the stock kind?  I have a 1600dp motor with a Solex 34 PICT-3 in a '62 bus.  
It's pretty cold here in Ann Arbor, so the little tiny extra heat
exchangers on the stock exhaust are looking pretty attractive.
Also the price is low ($40 for the Brazilian kind).

Also sealing the flanges to the heat boxes is a bitch, they're dented
and rusty.

Thanks for any input---
