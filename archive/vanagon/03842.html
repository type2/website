Subject: 80-83 Vanagon survey
Date: Wed, 7 Sep 94 19:01:12 EDT

The recent thread on head leaks  (head thread?) on 83-85 Vanagons reminds me
that I promised
to post the results for the July, 80-83 air cooled Vanagon minisurvey.
Only six postings came in: 1 of those was for a 73, 1 was from Joel who no
longer has an air-cooled vanagon but was kind enough to send in his
summary anyway; leaving four in total (including myself) a sample size too
small to draw any firm conclusions. Perhaps the survey should have
included FI Bus engines as well. Anyway the evidence, as small as it
is, does not point to any one problem (surprise). Engine life ranges from
50,000 to
over 100,000 miles. (In the case of the 50,000 mile engine, the owner
did not what the oil light meant). Around half are on at least their second
engine (do not extrapolate). All of the bodies
are in good shape and there doesn't appear to be any major mechanical
problems, except for periodic replacement of the fuel filter and coil. Its
a shame they had to replace these motors...no air-con, no head leaks, no
temp coolant sensors, no 20 foot coolant hoses...(no heat).

If you want the results e-mail me. Regards - DC
