 It would sure be nice to not have to worry about all that seam rust &gt;&gt;

Although initially it sounds great, I would be greatly concerned about crash
safety using fibergalss parts. VW designed and crash tested our trusty
vehicles with steel panels, not fiberglass.

While certainly there are carbonfiber auto componants that rival or exceed
the capabilities of steel, and certain car companies have produced and crash
tested composites for body panel usage, backyard manufacture of body panels
would be a highly-risky business to be in. 

The ethical and legal liability for failure of these parts during a colision
could be a lot worse than seam rust.

Sorry to pee in the campfire.
