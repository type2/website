Subject: Engine rebuild questions, '81 Vanogon

I had a leak down test done on my engine and the results said that the rings
and valves are seriously leaking.  I am planing to start a rebuilding the
engine as so as possible.  But what I want to know is there any way to know
test if the bottom end is still in good shape before I drop the engine? 
This engine has low miles, I just bought this van a couple of months 
ago knowing it had problems but I'm afraid the previous rebuild was a 
shoddy job.  This makes me worry that rebuilding only the top end will 
not be good enough.

I also want to work with a local machinist, Ghent Machine Service is the one
a friend recomended.  Any suggestions, picks or pans of Seattle area machine
shops will be appreciated. 

	Thank You.
