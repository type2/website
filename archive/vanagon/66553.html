Subject:      Suburu conversion manual and Subie powered airplane

Hi again

A few weeks back I posted a cry for help re replacing some coolant pipes
under my &quot;85 Vanagon that were Canadian-winter vandalized.
You all were nice enough to provide many helpful suggestions. I was seeking
the address of Tim Smith at the U of New Brunswick whom I did finally
contact. He was nice enough to send me a detailed treatise on how to
accomplish the feat in question. It was originally posted in June '97.
In chasing down a local tip about someone who was rumored to have done  the
same job in nearby Owen Sound Ontario I came across an interesting character
and vanhead. Unfortunately he wasn't of direct assistance as his job
involved a Suburu conversion (=E0 la Kennedy)  in a Type I where he used
copper as a coolant conduit beneath the van. I also noticed a partially
built light aircraft with another Subie providing the power.
Since there have been many recent postings about Suburu Conversions, I
thought I'd pass this along. It may be of interest to Type I owners (maybe
someone who is on both pages might relay this to the Type I-ers).=20
His name and address are as follows:
        Bill Hall (Type A mechanic and airplane buider)
        1280 3rd Ave E Apt 1
        Owen Sound Ontario Canada N4K 2L5     [519] 372-1560

He has written a 14 page manual on how to do the conversion in a Type I with
a Legacy. I think he wants about $35 CDN [c.25 U$). It is extremely detailed
and complete.

He has a computer but is not,as yet, on Internet. If anyone has a question
about his conversion or his airplane, they should phone, write him or e-mail
me. I would relay a message.

Thanks

Leo
