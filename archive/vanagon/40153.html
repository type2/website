Subject: RE: V6anagon soon to be re-V6'ed


&gt;I can't help but wonder, how long does it take you to remove an engine
&gt;from a VW bus anyway?  8^)-&amp;--


I used to remove my '69 bus's engine in about 45 minutes. For the '80
V6anagon, I had to figure out a new method, and try it twice-- that
tall, narrow 60-degree V6 was *real* teetery on the floor jack. So I
laid a thick wooden beam on supports across the engine hatch, attached
chains to the engine and draped them through the saddle mount on the
jack sitting on top of the beam, and used it like a baby cherry picker.
Took a couple of jacking sessions to get it low enough to draw it back
clear of the trans bellhousing, and then it didn't want to let go of
the tranny. Eventually wound up taking about 5 hours to get it clear.

Now that I know how to do it, might take 1 or 1-1/2 hours next time, if
the clutch doesn't have to be broken loose again.

Isn't the record something like 2 min 12 sec, by two guys at one of the
old bug-ins at Orange County International Raceway? And that was in a
bug with a fixed rear apron!
