&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt; doors are for?  Should they be slid to the front or back to keep the air
&gt; flowing or warm the bus up? 

Well, you ain't gonna like the answer to this...

 In NuBus ('82 Diesel), they do NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I often
have the door apart due to a previous post (The window falling off track),
and have tried to trace what they do. They go nowhere. There are a hole
into the bottom of the door interior. No air passes through there (the
air passes through the top of the door, in a separate chamber.)

 My guess is that in a former life they did something, and it wasn't worth
the ECN to change the drawings. Right now, they allow you to &quot;vent&quot; the
moisture from inside the door. 

 Can anybody else attest to this, or have I been sucking too much sweet-
smelling diesel exhaust? (I went home for lunch and drove NuBus back. Smiling
all the way looking at the leaves change from the HUUUGE front windshield)
