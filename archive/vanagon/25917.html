Subject: Re: more heating ideas

an idea-

take a battery and a 110v inverter and a 12v  battery charger.  hook the 
inverter up to run the charger to charge the battery as the inverter 
runs.  

this self-sustaining power can then be used to power high amperage 12v 
heaters, a water heater for showers, AND the espresso machine.

why didn't we think of this earlier??
