&gt; 
&gt; device that blocked off to the front grille? Did they work?
&gt; 



Sorry about that last undecipherable question. Our system here imposes ten
minute limits on our access time. So I was desperately writing
something when the message came on &quot;you will be disconnected in 1 minute...&quot;

Anyway, I recall an earlier thread on something that fit around or behind
the grille area. Someone said that this created a high pressure zone so
that more air was forced into the van. Since ours doesn't have them, I was
wondering if they also cut off the cold air in winter as well.....perhaps
they could be fabricated?

Thanks -DC
