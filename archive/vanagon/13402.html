&gt;Joel is right about the beam pattern causing glare, not a bright 
&gt;bulb.  US lighting specifications have lagged far behind Europe in 
&gt;terms of lens design and 'stray' light.  the US keeps the bulb 
&gt;wattage limit low because we have such lousy optics.  if you go with 
&gt;an illegal, european spec headlamp, you can also go to a higher watt 
&gt;bulb and get better light with less glare... talk to Westinghouse and 
&gt;Phillips about influencing US legislation on this point!

I can back that up - look at the beam patter of the Hella H-series 
lights.  The pattern looks like this:

                              /
            (dark)           /
                           /  (light)
              ------------- 
                (light)  

So you don't blind the oncoming traffic, but you get good visibilty to
the sides.
