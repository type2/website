Subject: screeching, angst inducing speedometer

My Speedometer on my 87 synchro sounds like a blade of grass being blown
between two thumbs or maybe a parakeet on bad acid. This only happens
when it is cold, like it pretty much is and will be till May or June.
Once it warms up inside It goes away. Any ideas how to fix this
extremely annoying sound.....
