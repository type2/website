Subject: Rear hatch strut question
Date: Thu, 2 Jan 97 10:43:36 -0600

to All:

i have in my hands 2 new hatch struts.  but they are different PNs and i
don't know which is the 'correct' one for an '87 with the rear wiper.

1.  Hydro-lift 251 829 332  somewhat easy to compress. mebbe 70 lbs.
2.  Suspander 251 829 331 B  nearly impossible to compress.  over 200 lbs.

i've seen the bad comment on Suspander in the archives.  anyone have the
lowdown on the two PNs??  which is correct?  or is a mix of these two good?
i'd like to know before i talk to the dealer i got them from... just like a
lawyer-- know the answer before you ask the question.
