Subject: Re: Vanagon Subwoofer

&gt;What about mounting a subwoofer smallish tube on the roof of a
&gt;Westfalia?  That is inside, of course, bolted up against the &gt;headliner,
&gt;hear the roof storage compartment.  Theoretically, bass is not
&gt;directional and could be mounted anywhere.....

&gt;/martha rubin

Not bad, but the interior of a Westfalia is a beautiful but delicate thing.
I am worried that putting anything like a bazooka in there 
would destroy the effect. I think all the bazookas I have seen are just 
too big. Unless our experts know of any small ones that are effective.
