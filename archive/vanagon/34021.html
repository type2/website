&gt; Have you ever seen the movie &quot;Bullit&quot; with Steve McQueen?
&gt; There is the BEST chase seen ever put on film about half
&gt; way through the movie.  It takes place I guess around 66 or
&gt; 67' in San Fran.  McQueen is driving a Mustang Fastback and
&gt; through his chase he passes many splitties and a number
&gt; of OLD bugs even including a oval I believe.  Check it out
&gt; for the VDubs or just for the fact that it is a great flick!

Coming home from school one day I failed to notice the signs and barriers 
around the street.  Crossing the street I am almost run down by a mustang 
being chased by a film truck.  I was in 4th or 5th grade coming home from 
Colma k-6 in Daly City and nearly got immortalized (de-mortalized) in that 
film.  There were bugs all over SF at that time. The chase came down 
Hillside st. and then out to Guadalupe Cyn Parkway.
