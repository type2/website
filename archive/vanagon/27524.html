&gt; I have a 81 Westy Vanagon with the built in gasoline heater.
&gt; It appears to work under the following circumstances:
&gt; 
&gt; 	1. Engine running, heat on full, switch rotated to on position.
&gt; 
&gt; 	2. Engine off, switch pushed in and rotated to engage 10 minute
&gt; 	   timer.
&gt; 
&gt; #1 works well when driving and #2 works well to preheat the van before
&gt; driving.  I would like to wire in a third option.  That is, I would like
&gt; to install a thermostat in parallel with the timer so that the heater would
&gt; kick in every once in a while when camping overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; Other than running out of gas, I can't see a problem with a functioning
&gt; heater.  I suppose a broken heater might vent exhaust gases into the
&gt; heater system, but that would be a problem while driving as well.
&gt; This would be no worse than an auxilliary propane heater, and a lot
&gt; cheaper.
&gt; 

Rather than a thermostat, I'd think that a timer would be the way to go.  
Have it fire the heater once an hour or so.  You'd need an auxiliary 
battery since the combustion motor and the auxiliary fan probably pull 
5-10 amps together.  Exhaust fumes could also trickle back into the van 
from underneath on a cold night, but a flexible metal duct could be 
rigged to divert the fumes off to the side.  

You'd also have to rewire the heater so that power is supplied without the
ignition on, or be willing to leave the ignition on all night.  I'm not
sure I'd recommend the latter option.  Too many electrical parts derive
power from the ignition, too many things to short and possibly cause a
fire and crisp you in your sleep.
