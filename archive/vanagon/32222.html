Subject: Porsche 356 assembly video

Hi Y'all,

Bill Abbott sent me this video to illustrate how to install the 
windshield on my bus.  It documents the entire assembly of a Porsche 356  
(the old Porsches that are basically VW's), including engine assembly.  
The tape, titled 'Made by Hand', was probably made in the '50's or early 
60's, but is extremely interesting and would give a novice an excellent 
overview on engine rebuilding.  It's also good for a chuckle or two.

Instead of returning it to him, Bill suggested offering it to anybody on 
the list who is interested, then they can return it to him (or the next 
guy?).

Sooo.... the first one to send me your mailing address gets it.  
Obviously you promise to take care of the tape and return it in a timely 
fashion.

Mitch
