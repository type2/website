&gt;any ideas/things for him to check would be greatly appreciated.  also, he

Matt,

Has your mechanic run the procedures outlined on pages 24.38-41 in the
Bentley manual?

Are you sure that he was looking at the right wiring diagram for your '81 (I
assume you have an &quot;AFC fuel injection&quot; system, nicht wahr?). There are a
lot of 'em in my Bentley!

Can't help with any other source for WD's, but good luck!

Regards,

Bill Devlin
