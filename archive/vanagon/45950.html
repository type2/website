Subject: Vanagon Spoiler and Key progress
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

I went to the other VW dealer today to try to get a key for my 88 Vanagon
they didn't have them in stock but they said they would have it next
Tuesday. I got two of them for $7.50 a piece.  While I was there I
spotted another Vanagon with some type of spoiler mounted under the
front bumper. It looked like a factory item. Does anyone know if this
was a factory item? Are there any aftermarket spoilers out there?
Thanks 

Justin
