Subject: Further Thoughts - EV Winnebago

At the risk of boring V_at_L readers, I want to add
three more items to the deficiencies list in my
recent report on the EV Winnebago.

Cons (cont'd.)

The pleated blind window coverings are awful.
They are flimsy, catch on things (latch on slider)
and the blind on the sliding door has raw edges
and is already parting company with the door
frame.

The tent may be waterproof, but the cloth tapes 
which are used to tie up the (unzipped) window covers
are extremely efficient capillary wick systems.  A
serious amount of water can come in via these tapes.

The front window curtain is silly.  The retention system
optimistically uses hook and loop dots to support a heavy 
curtain.  No way.  When I get time, I will replace the dots 
with snaps and domes.

YMMV.
