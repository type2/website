&gt; &gt; In CA the BUYER is responsible for obtaining a smog certificate even if

&gt; &gt; needed to resmog to reregister.  
&gt; 
&gt; NO NO NO!!!!   Sorry, but this is wrong.  It is the SELLER's responsibility
&gt; to provide a smog certificate when selling a used vehicle, unless they
&gt; have changed the rules in the last couple of months, which I doubt...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 				Smogging has to be done every other year
&gt; &gt; and mailed in with the reregistration payment.  
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it doesn't *have* to be.  You can register a vehicle without a smog
&gt; certificate, without penalty.  They just won't let you drive it.  :)

David, I agree with every point except the last one. We were allowed to
drive our Westfalia without a smog certificate for three months. We were
told by DMV (Sunnyvale) that we would be require to provide one upon
request but could always claim that we were going to do it the next day.
Not so much a loophole but a relaxed set of requirements. BTW the onus is
on the original owner to smog - DC
