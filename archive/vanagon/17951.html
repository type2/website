&gt; I mounted a 12v muffin fan directly onto the aluminum cooling fins

Would that be the acclaimed muffin man, who, seated at the table in the
utility muffin research kitchen said, &quot;there is not, nor ought there be,
something so exalted on the face of God's great Earth, as that prince of
foods, the muffin?

Just curious.
