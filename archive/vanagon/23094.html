&gt;Regarding the great trip North.  The Dalton Highway to Prudhoe Bay was

&gt;Montana, Idaho, Washington, British Columbia, Alberta, Northwest 
&gt;Territories, and Alaska.  Just outside of Fairbanks there are 5 hot 
&gt;springs, and 3 of them are accessible by road.  I've made the trip more

D'oh.  Opened to the public permanently?  I guess Inuvik no longer has
bragging rights.

Are you going to join us, Fred?  (Presumably in transit.)
