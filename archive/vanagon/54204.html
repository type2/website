Subject: Flashing Temp Light- Solved

For the past few weeks the temp light has been flashing madly- 
intermittantly at first, becoming more frequent past week.  The engine 
certainly wasn't overheating, it would start flashing within 30 sec.
Coolant level was OK.  At first the temp gauge was reading normally.  
I thought it might be the level sensor, but no change in behavior on 
disconnecting that sensor.  I thought it must be the control unit (on 
fuse/relay panel).  $27 later, still flashing, thought the gauge was 
by now rising off the top of the scale.  Must be the temp sensor, I 
thought.  VW makes 2 for my model year(90), with and w/o green stripe.  
Local dealer only had with, said it was probably the right one.  Got 
under the van yesterday to change the sensor and found that a piece of 
protective trim had fallen off sheet metal and the wires had worn 
through insulation, shorting out.  I had found the trim on the 
driveway months ago and thrown it out, thinking it was from someone 
elses car, I sure didn't know where it came from.  Anyway, 3 inches of 
tape solved the problem.  Oh yeah, the sensor was the wrong one.

I've only sent this one in because I had not found this cause of the 
problem in the archives.
