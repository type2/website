Subject: Re: O2 sensor question

The O2 sensor is in closed loop while in startup and warmup, then it goes 
to open loop after the sensor is at operating temperature.

&gt; I beg to differ. I have a dash mounted LED (O2 sensor) monitor. I have
&gt; NEVER seen the system go into open loop once it reaches operating
&gt; temperature. In fact the higher the RPMs the faster the lean/rich cycles
&gt; occur.

&gt; &gt;You see, the system goes into an open-loop mode. bypassing the sensor 
&gt; &gt;at  something like 3000 rpm and above. Then engines make so little power
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;at altitude that you usually downshift and keep the rev's high.  The 
&gt; &gt;airflow meter, which kinda measures air mass, kinda compensates.  I
&gt; understand 
&gt; &gt;the hot-wire versions do a better job.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In closed-loop operation (normal driving) the O2 sensor will do a good 
&gt; &gt;job of controlling for optimum burn, including compensating for
&gt; altitude.
