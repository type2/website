Subject: '71 bus rear brake drums
Date: Tue, 28 Nov 1995 09:34:10 -0600 (CST)

Hello all, This weekend I decided to remove my rear brake drums to 
have a look at my stuck adjusting stars.  I removed the rear wheel and
those two 11mm bolts on the drum.  The drum did not come off.  All the
books say that post August 1970 should just come off.  Mine was built 
in November so they should be that kind.  They don't look like the one
piece drums in the book.  So, am I missing something here?  There is 
no mention of any pulling or cranking to get these things off in Muir,
Bentley or Haynes.  I do have the mongo set of sockets to remove the 
axle nut but I didn't do that since I didn't have seals or anything 
for the bearings.  I did spray the thing with liquid wrench thinking 
it was just stuck in the center there.  No luck.  I finally applied 
tiny amounts of the stuff to the stars themselves and they moved!  
Tiny amounts.  Nice brakes.  I am still puzzled about the drum though.

Jim
