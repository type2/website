Subject: Re: Death to VW Vandals

This sounds like a newsgroup I've seen: alt.rec_dot_death.to.vw.vandals

Hope you find a witness...or three. If it's any condolence, it's not good 
to get bad kharma with VWs...they'll pay; though it would be nice for you 
to get the satisfaction of watching them pay. Peace, Joe
