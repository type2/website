&gt; Kevin, Kevin, Kevin...haven't those VW ads sunk in yet?...
&gt; A EuroVan GT is the current EV that comes w/ a team issue
&gt; GT bike and rack, didn't you know?...   :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Norman
&gt; '93 EV MV
&gt; '84 3Rensho
&gt; '88 Mike Melton (of '84 Raleigh/US Olympic Team frame builder fame)
&gt; '81 Michael Johnson tandem (Tango tandems fame)
&gt; and a shitty mountain bike, but who cares about them...  ;-)
&gt; 
Actually, I saw an ad in a magazine for the VW Jetta Trek.  It's a VW
Jetta (duh) that comes complete with a Trek mountain bike and bike roof
rack.  Thought it was really neat :) .
