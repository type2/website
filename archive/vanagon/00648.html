&gt; I would really like to get a Vanagon Pick-up.  I know they were imported to

&gt; Vancouver BC and visit a car dealer.

I remember seeing an add a few years back in HVW. A outfit in 
Coeur d Alene, Idaho that sold Pick-ups. Best of all they sold 
SYNCRO Pick-ups, and crew cabs. I don't have any back issues at hand
maybe someone else might. Ive seen one driving around in Whittier, Ca.
(SYNCRO Pick-up that is).
