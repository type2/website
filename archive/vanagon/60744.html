Subject: Pastel or Alpine white paint?
Date: Sat, 31 May 1997 19:03:52 -0400

Does anyone know if Alpine &amp; Pastel white are the same color?  I have an
'85 Westy and the &quot;Pastel White&quot; touch-up matches it but I can't find any
spray cans of it, only Alpine White.  If they aren't the same and anyone
knows how I can get Pastel White, please let me know.
Thanks,
