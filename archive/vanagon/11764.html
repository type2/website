&gt;&gt;	About the dipstick oil temperature guage..... I had one on
&gt;&gt;my '67 bus for many years.  It was electric, not mechanical like the one
&gt;&gt;on my bug.  I thought it was great.  No problems; I bought it from
&gt;&gt;J C Whitney.  Just one data point for you.

I made one for my 71 beetle years ago. I found out that oil temp was
lower running on freeway than in town. My vanagon's coolant temp has
similar effect. The temp gauge tends to go slightly lower on flat freeway
(not hills) than in town.
