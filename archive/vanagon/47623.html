Subject: re:&quot;'84 vanagon tap dance&quot;

OK so, I just bought this vanagon and if I let it set for a couple
of days the tappets knock and the bus smokes when I crank it up.  I
is &quot;supposed&quot; to go away when I drive it, but since my clutch slave
leaks I can't drive it until I fix the clutch.  So... Is this common?
