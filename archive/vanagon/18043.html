Terry, 
I have a catalytic converter and muffler for a 1.9 liter waterboxer.
The catalytic converter is mainly for show(blown out) but the muffler is only
six months old. $200 for the whole thing.
 
&gt;I will probably try to be there just to meet you guys. The only problem
&gt;is I probably cannot drive my Vanagon since I am still looking
&gt;for a catalytic converter and complete exhaust system before the shoebox
&gt;can pass inspection. Anybody knows where I can get something for less 
&gt;than the $900.00 Vw is charging?
