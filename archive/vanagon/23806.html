Subject: No Way!

	Split the list by coolant??? The poetry, the irony! - it would 
mean that *vanagon* owners would want both lists since their vehicles 
come in both flavors. This is the *vanagon* list for goshsakes. Those
of use with non-vanagons are welcomed here, but making the list a PITA
for the group it proportedly serves seems a bit much! I also notice
that lots of both types show for the West Coast get togethers.

	For those overwhelmed by the volume of mail, use Digest mode
and just skip the ones you don't want.

	Good grief!
