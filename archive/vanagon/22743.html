Subject: Re: another Vanagon Hitch

 Got a close look at a welded on hitch. A piece of 2&quot; wide angle iron, 1/4&quot; 
thick walls and say 4-1/2 feet long was welded onto (over) the rear tow eyes 
under the bumper. The angle iron tilted downward slightly, same as the tow 
eyes. A heavy bent bar 1/2&quot; x 1&quot; was welded directly to the bottom of the 
engine mount, and shaped as below. The draw bar was about 3&quot; x 5/8&quot; thick, 
bent to reach hanger and crossbar for bolting to.

You get the idea! Looked Ok for 1000lb or so. Not real solid since the 
bumper brackets are not beefed up at all. VW supplied hitch has thicker 
brackets made of box section, not flat material. Welds will crack, make sure 
it's done properly. The draw bar can be unbolted, the cross bar stays on, 
along with the hanger bar.  tim s.
