There is a story behind the 'no-winch' deal. I got this from Ryder agent, 
seems someone was attempting to load a siezed up farm tractor which weighed 
several thousand pounds, using the 2000lb. rated winch. The winch tore off 
the trailer and beaned the guys helper. For legal reasons there shall be no 
more winches, excepting your own.   tim s.
