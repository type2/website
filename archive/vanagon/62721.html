Subject: cooler thermostat

   From VW N/A, BUT I think it was Jim from Bus Boys that came up
   with one that runs cooler.  Just mentioned not to long ago on the
   list. I don't have his E-mail address handy! Anyone interested?

&gt; &gt;     Try a cooler temperature thermostat first! This will be much more
&gt; &gt;     effective.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;From what I undertand there is only one temp thermostat offered.
