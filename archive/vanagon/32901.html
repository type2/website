Subject: Red Hot Pipes on '83 1/2 Vanagon -- Help!

I was burping the air out of my cooling system (again) as the sun was
setting.  In the failing light of evening I noticed the red hot glow of my
pipes (at each cylinder).  This doesn't seem normal and would love to know
the cause and cure (if it is wrong).

Thanks in advance,

Marty
