Subject: Interesting T2s in San Diego

'65 single cab, new 5 speed engine (?!), custom paint, new carpet + upholstery, this guy's asking 3500, (619) 735-8756 (looks really clean in the photo, all these are from the Auto Trader)

1958 VW Camper Van, current registration, smog exempt, strong motor, runs strong, good brakes, clean int, body good, no dents, $1400 obo (619) 266-9350

1967 VW BUS new eng, 4 new tires, runs great, needs a little body work, extra gauges, (619) 273-4201 (looks like it's got an elevated roof in the middle, neither a Westy or a pop top, kind of a 1/3 upwards dent).

There's also a'64, a '65 and a '62 in varying conditions... hey, that '64 (no engine) is only $550... I'm sure my spouse wouldn't object TOO strenuously!!!

Bunch of 72s in here, plenty of Vanagon campers, too. 

And one '93 Eurovan for $17.9k, not a pop top but has table/seats/bed. 

Here's a '66 VW Westfalia Camper, rare, clean and original blue, $2988, (619) 792-7976
