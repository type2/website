Well, this isn't bus related, but since there is a large # of musicians
on the list (which, after a sharp increase, has flattened out. bodabing!)

Do you know anyone who knows piano tuning?

I just bought a piano tuning toolkit, dated 1906 (stamped on various
pieces) for $40, but I have no idea what is what in it.

This thing came with 3 tuning hammers (I know what they are) tuning forks,
various little do-dads I've never seen before, and there's a little square
piece of wood with a hole in it with the word &quot;Baldwin&quot; which I assume
is a maker.

They all came in a light canvas wrap-holer thingy with lots of little 
pockets.

Did I get taken, or is this a good find?  I'm intending to give it as a
present.

Thanks!

Thom
