Subject: Which tires?185 or 205

Sorry if this gets posted from my other aol account... not enough coffee
yet...

 Almost died driving through that snow on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and down
95 on friday.  The fully loaded wasserbed was sliding around on its bald
tires, and I vowed that , if alive monday, I would buy 4 new ones.
 I was thinking about making the switch to 205's, looking for smoother ride,
more traction in mud &amp; snow.  And frankly, the westy looks like it's standing
on birdlegs on them skinny tires.

Is there any consensus on this?

Also... 
1.   The sliding door is having trouble latching. The door fits fine and
there is no body damage.  Bently does not address this, any ideas?  
2.  Besides the oily rag and light oil lube per Bently, where, and with what
do you lube in the door mechanism.  What parts need to be inspected.
3.  Can seatbelt retractors be lubricated, or should they only be replaced?

Thanks.

Peter
