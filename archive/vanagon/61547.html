Subject: Re: syncro with snorkel ? Yes/No?

If the snorkel you are refering to is an extension of the air intake,
then my 1983 diesel has one.  It extends from the air cleaner to just
below the louvers on the left side air intake at the rear.  I know a
diesel does not mind running underwater as long as it gets air to
breath, but seeing as this is not the intended mode of operation, I am
not sure why this 'snorkel' is on my air intake.  Any thoughts on this?
