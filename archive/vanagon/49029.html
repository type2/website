Subject: OXS reset

Greetings!!

I recall some time ago there was mention on the list about the sudden 
illumination of the OXS light in the instrument panel.  Someone was 
commenting that this was just an indicator that it was time for 
service and that it can be reset somewhere.

My question is, where is the reset location and how is it 
accomplished.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
