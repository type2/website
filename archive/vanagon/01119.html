Subject: Hello and exhaust parts for a '76 Kombi?

Hi all,

Please feel free to add me and my '76 Campmobile (a.k.a. &quot;The Loaf&quot;) to your 
Who's Who.

Now down to business...I'm in desperate need of exhaust parts. Basically, I 
need everything back to, but not including the manifolds. I have no catalytic 
converter, and a manual transmission. I even took the unprecedented step of 
going to a dealer, who told me that one side's elbow pipes were discontinued, 
though the other side wasn't. How you can discontinue 1/2 of a mirrored set, 
both of which are necessary, must be something like how the former Soviet 
Union could have surpluses of left boots. Go figure.

Someone mentioned a place in Michigan, but perusing &quot;Hot VW&quot; and &quot;VW Trends&quot; 
hasn't turned up any places yet. 

Cheers,
--Strat
