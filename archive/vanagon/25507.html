Subject: Re: Bob Hoovers &quot;...Hot Rod your VW&quot;

&gt;&gt;Bob Hoover   author &quot;How to Hot Rod your VW&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Where can I get a copy of this book?
&gt;&gt;What year was it printed and by whom?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks, Martin
&gt;&gt;

Oh dear, did imply he wrote the book?  But no, How to Hot rod your VW's is a
book of it's own.  Bob Hoover is a person on the list who offers up email
sermons.  His sermons can be found through Dave Schwarzes home page on the
www.  He is not otherwise published.  Excuse me.
