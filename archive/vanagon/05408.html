&gt;My impression is that the Type 4 engines, including Peter Williams' 73, hold
&gt;up the transaxles, rather than vice versa.  So Peter you do need to support
&gt;the trans while the engine is out, either with a jack stand underneath, or
&gt;with a 2x4 hung from chains if you want the van to be able to roll while the
&gt;engine is on the operating table.
I know for a fact that the transmission in my ex-girlfriend's '78 2.0 bus was
held up by a hefty cross member.  (I'd followed Muir's advice about the
chain, and once we had the engine out I said, &quot;Hey, this isn't doing a thing!&quot;
You could move the chain back and forth because it wasn't supporting any
weight.)  But I don't know if all Type 4 busses are this way or if the early
ones need support.
