SStones re-butts:
&gt; If it's not air in the system, it could be that your heater core is
&gt; all plugged up with crud.
&gt; You really should get full heat at full fan.

Well...  My heater core should be free and easy!  I boiled it out
and flushed it.  I disagree with full heat at full fan for 2
reasons: 
1.)  I don't think anyone with ANY water cooled volkswagen
gets full heat on the 3rd speed.  People, please prove me wrong!   I
think VW feels that 3rd speed is for summer ventilation flow, not
max heat as per #2 
2.)  The Van manual (not that I'm a believer in
owners manuals) says max heat is derived with the fan in #2, not 3

&gt; I know this sounds patronizing Dan, don't hate me for it.
No hate taken, you'd have to tell me which oil to use to REALLY tick 
me off  :)

&gt; A lot of people don't know how to use the controls.
Right.  But remember I'm a geek so I've dug around and found out what 
lever does what.   Another :)

&gt; For best heating you should have them set...
Point well taken...
&gt; top,    right       windshield
&gt; 2nd,    right       hot
&gt; 3rd,    left        feet
&gt; 4th,    left        flow
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of people think that that flow one, bottom, should be closed off
&gt; to warm the van, but as long as your heater core is heating...
Well, I was under that impression.
