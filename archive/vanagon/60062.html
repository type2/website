Subject: Re: Mountain driving

Having lived in Boulder CO for 4 years with my 87 westy automatic (not 
synchro) I can tell you that I drove it alot in the mountains but rarely 
in the winter.  I love driving in the mountains with it....you just 
can't be in a hurry!  I 70- Eisenhower tunnel in both directions, vail 
pass west bound are the worst.  Mainly because of the traffic (heavy in 
June) and the slow speeds to which my van hits when on parts of these 
grades.  Any of the passes that are off the highway ( Loveland, 
Berthoud, Monarch, Wolf Creek are also slow going but alot less people. 
I would suggest you take it everywhere and not worry about it!  
Definately check your brakes for those downhills!  Also, if you haven't 
been to Telluride/Durango area I would HIGHLY recommend it!  My favorite 
part of CO BY FAR.  Another at the top is Crested Butte.....
