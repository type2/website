Subject: Re: O2 Sensor

Hello,

I put in a new O2 sensor in my van because the wire
had come loose on the one that was in there.

Now the O2 sensor light stays on constantly, is there
something I need to reset to tell it I put in a new sensor
or is it indicative of another problemm.

Please respond to me directly

Yes, the 02 sens light is designed to come on at certain mileage 
intervals and has to be reset on order to turn it off. Does your van 
run any different with the new sensor? My Mechanic (PetroSillos 
Bros.) told me not to bother getting a new one because they don't 
make any difference, ie, the control center can't even tell if its 
there. He said they were initially put on to control emissions, but 
he has tested buses before and after installing new sensors and 
couldn't notice any change. Let me know if you noticed any 
improvement, in mpg or whatever.
