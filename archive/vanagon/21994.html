OK, this is it. We leave tomorrow afternoon from Indianapolis to 
Charleston to pick up Roger, the 1980 vanagon. Armed with all the 
suggestions picked up from you guys (thanks bunches!) and loaned 
equipment from my friends (thanks Rich &amp; Jim) we plan to tow the bus home 
on a small trailer. We should be in Charleston in the afternoon on 
Friday, will probably head out for a couple of brewskies, then crash in a 
real bed (not the mattress in the back of the pick up), shower and head 
on the road again. If all goes well, it'll be sitting in my driveway on 
Sunday. Thanks again for all you encouragement and help. I'll keep you up 
to date on the progress. I've turned off the Vanagon list till I return, 
so if anyone has any last min instructions, please e-mail me directly.
