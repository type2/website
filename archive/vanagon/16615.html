Subject: Leak Free Battery (fwd)
Date: Sun, 30 Apr 95 12:10:36 EDT

This posted to the corrado mailist recently and might be of
even more interest here.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a leak-free (so they claim) car battery, the Optima.
&gt; Is uses a significantly different construction than
&gt; ordinary car batteries.  It is basically a &quot;six-pack&quot; of
&gt; spiral-wound cells.
&gt; 
&gt; Claims:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Can be charged at 20 Amps in 2.75 hours.
&gt; 
&gt; 	No vibration-caused failures.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Lasts 3-4 times longer.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Can be operated in any position, even upside down.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Zero-maintenance, no corrosion.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Longer shelf life.  (&quot;months&quot;)
&gt; 
&gt; 	2 year full replacement warranty, remainder of
&gt; 	72 months pro-rated.
&gt; 
&gt; 	800 Cold cranking Amps
&gt; 	Reserve capacity: 120 minutes
&gt; 	9 15/16&quot; x 6 3/4&quot; x 7 13/16&quot;
&gt; 	39 pounds
&gt; 
&gt; For Corrados, you want the 800S model.  There is also a
&gt; 800U model with both top and side terminals, and a 850/6
&gt; 6 Volt model.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought one of these last week.  So far so good.
&gt; 
&gt; The spec is a bit taller than the stock &quot;group 41&quot;
&gt; battery, but it seems to fit okay.  I had to rearrange
&gt; the cables slightly so they would reach without being
&gt; strained.
&gt; 
I personaly have seen these as about 8 of them were used
in an electric car project around the university where they
were frequently quick charged with good results.  800cca is
pretty impressive as is the 2 yr full replacement warranty.
I had thought these were actually lead acid gel cells and
don't know what the spiral wound construction implies but
the cases do have six individual circular bumps.  Certainly
the ticket for stopping battery related rust problems forever.
I though the university paid about $100 each though.  And
how about that 6 volt model, perfect for the split that doesn't
get out much.  I'll try to find out more about these things.
