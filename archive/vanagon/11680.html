Subject: folding table latch

Has anyone tried adjusting the table latch on their T3 or T4?

I have a pretty good idea what needs to be done, but I'd like to consider
alternate solutions to the same problem before I do something I may regret.

Oh, yeah, the symptoms...  the two way latch tab is not situated close 
enough to the metal lip of the hole that the latch fits into, so when
I'm pulling a 0.85g left-hander (yeah, right!, uh-huh....) the table
usually ends up rebounding off the bottom of the panel it's mounted on,
making a racket that's starting to bother me.
