Subject: Wiper pump and window seal for 83

        Salutations wee global citizens. Dont know if anyone remembers me
but I was on the list 4-5 months ago. Ive got a 83 Brown camper van, and
reside in the most northern capital in North America.....yes Edmonton.
        Anywho, a couple of questions for you all.
1) The window seal on the sliding side door is starting to droop out of the
frame in one spot. Can anyone suggest a good sealant or fix to get it to
stay put up in the frame?

2) My drivers side washer fluid sprayer is just not doing a decent job. The
passenger side one sprays nicely, and exactly where I direct it, but the
drivers side one has a pathetic little shot come out, and its kinda
cockeyed. I  think there may be somehting stuck in it, or else, if they have
individual pumps for each side, the pump may be FUBAR.

        And on a sad note, I think my sink pump is shot. I havent got around
to taking it out or doing any investigating, due to the cold, but I just
have that gut feeling. Anyone have a price on a pump for me. 
        On a happy note, Ill be driving to Vancouver again at the end of
March. I get to see the ocean again..........ah the ocean.

Nice to be here again.

Better to be hated for what you are, than to be loved for what you are not.
