Got to the dealer for the engine pipe and brackets.  The other pipes and 
muffler can be after market as they are easy to replace when needed.

After reviewing the 97 Archives and recent postings on exhaust systems, I am
still left with a basic question for my 86 vanagon. So, what is the best
compromise in a full exhaust replacement given the following criteria?  It
needs to have a long life for our very corrosive Southeast Alaska
environment, mabey a bit of additional horsepower, a price that won't
require a second mortgage on my home, and a vendor that will ship.

An email address, or phone number for the vendors that you think would be
best, would be appreciated.
Thanks
