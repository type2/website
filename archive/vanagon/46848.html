Mark wrote of his trip in the Rockies
&quot;However, with sustained climbing in a lower gear, especially 2nd, temp 
would
quickly shoot up to 230 at which point I would pull over and give her a
rest.&quot;

Mark owns an 87 Syncro Camper.  I think that his example shows about the 
most
extreme case.  High altitudes, steep grades, 2nd gear speeds, added weight 
of
Syncro, added weight of Camper, probably added weight of passengers &amp;
luggage.  I don't know if any other 9 year old (likely considerably over 
100k
miles) vehicle could be expected to perform much better under such
conditions.  An example like this of extreme conditions does not prove the
point for the general case.  Only that when pushed too far, any engine
(especially a 9 year old one) will show that it has limits.
