Subject: Whatnot Karma Circle Completed!

A very big thanks to both Michael Heron in Toronto and Ray Hale in Florida
for coming through with What-not spice rack cabinets for me. Between the two
I am able to assemble a reasonable facsimile of a good one! The items that
were hosed on one were available on the other. It was reinforced to me by
our spiritual guru on the road &quot;Bob&quot; that it is super important to give
credit and give thanks to those who help! I would definitely second that
thought. Thanks alot folks for putting up with my constant yelping for such
an item. Now watch, they will pop up everywhere! ;)

BTW: Does anyone have a perfect set of grey mats for under the front seats?
(Need them, but kidding to make a funny point)
