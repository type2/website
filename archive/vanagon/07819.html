Bummer of a story...good luck with the insurance scammers, er,
adjusters.  Surely though, the guy pulled out in front of *you* from
the other lane, and where he was 20 seconds before that should be
irrelevant (right?), and so you should be in the clear as far as fault
is concerned.  Any witnesses to back you up?
