Subject: trim(ming) party (martha's)


This is for the (tree) trimming party, December 15th (Friday), at 5 p.m. on.
We're getting a good response so far.  But the more, the merrier.  Some people
below (signified by the &quot;?&quot;) are &quot;maybies.&quot;

Sign up now!  :)

-

Dave Kautz and family
Bradley Prunehead (who proposes to bring lasagne, delivered directly 
                   on to yer floor)
Harvey Chao? (if he gets his own tree trimmed first, maybe)
Al Knoll (who professes to making BBQ for us as his culinary contribution)
Thom Fitzpatrick?
Jeff Schneiter/Argo?
(Swiss) Al Hubbard?
Steve/Linda Johnson?
