Subject:      Re: How to Pop off Sliding Door Panel

Mark:

I just did this repair yesterday. Just received my new Bentley as a
birthday gift form my brother. Simply get under the panel with a
screwdriver close to the retainer and gently pry is out, should come out
very easily. You may want to wrap the shaft of the screwdriver with a
cloth to protect the finish. I was afraid I would break the retainers
since they are old, 86 Syncro, but all came out and back in without a
hitch.

I was so confident, I went to work on the drivers door the see if I could
fix the power mirrors that have never worked since I bought the van.
Surprise, the PO had installed an after market speaker in the bottom of
the doors, then forgot to plug-in the harness for the mirrors. Quick
connect and sha-zam, power mirrors.

Don't forget to lube all the mechanical thingys in the slider while you
have the panel off!!!
