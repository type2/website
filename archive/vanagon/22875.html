&gt; I could not find a floormat for the back that I liked, so I went to a

&gt; knife.  For extra protection from the kids, I placed a layer of nylon
&gt; (heavy duty garbage bags) underneath it, cut out the holes where the
&gt; heater is and where the seat mounts are.

Someone on this list about a year ago also cut their own carpets and
had the great idea to go to a carpet store and have them stitch
all the way around the outside.  This made it look professional
and cost almost nothing.
