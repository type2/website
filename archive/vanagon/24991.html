Subject: Anyone need '80 Vanagon patch panels?

Since no one wants to buy the whole '80 Vanagon, I'm going to part it out. 
If anyone wants the shell when I'm done stripping it... it's thiers free. 
Likewise, if anyone needs a panel, it's free.  But I need to know before I
cut it up (of course).  As far as I can tell there's no rust on it, but it
has some body damage.  Also... all the interior camping gear is going in 
the trash this Tuesday... while I can drive the bus to the disposal place.
So that's all free... it's not a Westy, I think it's Adveturewagon.

I hate to cut up a drivable bus, but I want to get rid of it.  So this is 
also last call for buyers of the whole thing, $700 OBO.  I'll probably 
start cutting Wednesday (When the reg expires).

Umm... it's in the bay area in California.
