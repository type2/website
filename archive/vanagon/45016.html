&gt; Well, after hearing a ton of different responses concerning the use of a
&gt; second oil cooler, ranging from  Do not use one, they're supposed to run
&gt; hot, use one, put it outside, put it inside, put it here put it there...you
&gt; get the picture...I have decided to use one. My reasons are as follows.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. My Westy runs up to about 270 with only an hours worth of freeway
&gt; driving in 70-80 degree weather. Timing is fine, compression is good, 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I run 89 octane,.....

This is the first time I saw 89 octane. This is your problem. Your engine is 
made to run on 91, period. 

You can drop compression and run cheap fuel, but if you run a stock engine you 
need 91 octane. If you rebuild and flycut the heads and case, you raise 
compression and make the problem worse.


&gt; the vehicle runs good.


Except it overheats! Try 91 and see what happens.


&gt; 2. I'm going to be travelling almost 10,000 miles in a month, during the
&gt; hottest month of the year in the US.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. I'm going to be towing  a small (4 x 8') utility trailer on the way back.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. I don't want to have to stop EVERY hour for a half hour to let the
&gt; engine cool down.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. What the hell.
&gt;

&gt;                                         Tschus!

&gt;                                                         Tom
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;So you're going to take us for a ride eh?&quot;
&gt; &quot;Yeah, come on&quot;
&gt; &quot;Well I don't have a sister!&quot;
&gt; &quot;That's ok we no gotta car!&quot;


Have fun
