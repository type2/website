Subject: Volvo Coupes

Sorry to bug the whole list with this off-topic, but hey, it's still about
a European car starting with a &quot;V&quot;:

During the thread on seat interchanges, one of this group admitted to owning
a Bertone-bodied Volvo coupe.  I deleted all the posts, and my feeble mind
can only recall that it might have been one of the Daves - now THAT really
narrows it down, right?

The February 95 issue of &quot;Collectible Automobile&quot; has an article on the 
78-81 Volvo 262C Bertone Coupes, as &quot;future collectibles&quot; - and singles
out the leather of the Coupe seats for special praise.
