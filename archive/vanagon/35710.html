&gt; some friends of mine were happily tootling along in their 65 21 window one
&gt; day when this dingbat red neck pulled out of his driveway in front of them
&gt; leaving no time to stop.  The passenger door of the bus was wedged shut , and
&gt; the front nose crumpled in the impact under the right side headlight.  My
&gt; friends were fine.  Just shaken.   And luckily they got insurance money out
&gt; of it!!    The front frame under the floor of a split is very sturdy and
&gt; reinforced, and it was not even bent.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that the best safety measure is to stay alert and keep your beakes in
&gt; good order.
&gt;
&gt; oh- and BTW the bus was saved- a new (old) nose was welded on, window pillars
&gt; and all, and the passenger door replaced- both same color as the bus.  it is
&gt; on the road and looks great!

One reason I quit driving the 67 was I was starting to get nervous because
I drive the same 70mile round trip every day and I noticed I was starting
to get too used to it.  Had to hit the brakes hard a couple of times
because I was changing a tape or something when traffic puddled up ahead of
me.  Now my daughter has a liscence, but I also worried about screwing up
when my wife or one of my kids was riding in the front with me...

On the other hand, I never hit anything with it during nearly 300k miles I
put on it in 19.5 years (except for backing up into the center turn lane in
front of our house and having the rear bumper hit someone's tire in heavy
fog - no damage to either vehicle, just a little black mark on the bumper).

I guess there's two factors at work here:

1) Buses were built when they actually used decent-guage steel for body
panels and frames.  This means they are more likely to survive the same
kinds of accidents that they were hosed in when OTHER cars were similarly
solid (not just the Miata would lose today!).  (A friend of mine was
involved in a head-on collision with a japanese pickup while driving down
from Mt Pinos several years ago.  The pickup was speeding and crossed the
line around a curve.  My friend probably was taking it easy, but relative
closing speed must have been over 60mph.  My friend was in the hospital for
three months with serious leg injuries, and complained of constant pain
after that.  But he lived.
I've seen overturned buses on at least 3 occaisions.  The top never
collapsed, and in one case, a bunch of guys rolled it back over and drove
it home.  Another friend lost his girlfriend when a Datsun pickup she was
riding passenger in rolled and the top collapsed).

2) Having shopped junkyards for spare parts for the past 20+ years, I've
seen some pretty scarily compressed vehicles.  Not so many today, because
the buses that wind up in the pickapart yards are usually junked because
they don't run and/or the owner has given up on them.  So, many aren't even
wrecked (thrashed, maybe).  I did see a split van once that had been
rear-ended HARD.  Whole vehicle was at least 3 feet shorter.  Engine was
pushed forward and down as the other vehicle plowed over it and into the
cargo area.

These days, what with fewer two-lane highways with people leapfrogging
trucks into oncoming traffic, and more freeways where it's a lot harder to
have a head-on, it's safer all-round for driving.  The kind of freak
accidents that pulverize cars are hopefully a lot less frequent than they
used to be, so this is probably a big factor in bus safety.

Stay awake, alert, and keep the old buses running!
