Subject: RE: Battery Plates



&gt;okay, i'm going to have to order a battery plate...anyone have a number for
&gt;Rocky Mountain?

1-800-544-1066, or
1-719-687-1003

&gt; also...if i can't get this done for this weekend, would it be
&gt;bad to run the engine on a short weekend trip with  something rigged up 
before
&gt;i get it welded? i understand the pressure will be off and i don't want to
&gt;ruin the engine obviously, but i really want to take the van this weekend.
&gt;i'll only be going about 200 miles.

Nope, a flaky battery plate won't affect the engine.
The main idea, is to keep the battery from dragging on the ground
as you drive!  :)  A piece of plywood is a good temporary patch.
