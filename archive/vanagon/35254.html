Subject: Stewart Warner gas heater -- vented?
Date: Tue, 13 Feb 96 21:55:05 EST


Hi 

NY is having a cold spell again, and auxillary gas heaters have
been on my mind the last few days. I was curious about the Stewart
Warner heater used in US models in the 70's.

A '73 Westy I saw the other day had one of these. Unlike the Espars 
I've seen the Stewart Warner was mounted inside the bus, between the
sink-fridge unit and the backwards facing seat behind the driver.

Is the Stewart Warner heater vented outside? In that case where
does the exhaust go? Downwards somehow?

Does anybody use these for heating while camping/sleeping, or
are they like the Espars mostly for while driving, or just before?

Thanks for any insights,
/Martin
