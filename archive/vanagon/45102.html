&gt;he's talking about the old speedos with the little I II III shift markings
&gt;at certain speeds. at least, that's what *I* thought he was talking about.

He said that not even the Wasserboxers should be fun over 4000rpm for any
length of time because nasty things will happen.  The wasserboxers have
tachs that redline well over 5000rpm.


&gt;
&gt;&gt;I did know that the red line on the ac is 4400 rpm, however.
&gt;
&gt;huh?? redline for the air conditioner?? where did you hear this??
&gt;
&gt;joel

By ac I meant Air-Cooled.  My mistake for mixing abbreviations....sowwy
