I just looked on rec.auto.vw, and only noted 12 posts in all, and they
seemed reasonably polite.

So did you piss him off or what? If you think this is a problem, you could
send a note to postmaster_at_wichita.KS.ATTGS_dot_com and shut him down.

Maybe his mailer's broken. That doesn't make him a jerk.
