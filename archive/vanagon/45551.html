Subject: know any VW mechanics in baltimore?

A friend of mine needs some help with her VW Rabbit GTI.....there's a 
major oil leak coming from somewhere.  

Someone posted a note about a good mechanic in Baltimore last year, but I 
failed to write it down at the time.  Does anybody have any recommendations??

Thanks for the help.
