&gt;episode 16: I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Weiner (sorry, folks, but i think
&gt;            those Weiner-mobiles are the silliest thing on the road. i've
&gt;            actually passed one on the road!! :)

I have a strange feeling that to non bus enthusiasts, we all look like we're
driving Weiner-mobiles.  Actually if they made a Weiner-mobile with syncro
and a pop-top weiner I might consider it...but only if it had a 1600 DP.
