Subject: My 'new' '86 Vanagon

Hi all!
I posted to this list several weeks ago when I was searching for a Vanagon.
Following the advice (for which I am very gratefull!!), I bought a 1986
smoke-silver Vanagon today.  [it is a fantastic van!!! - very smooth &amp; quiet]
It one is not perfect - though the body and interior are excellent.  The
engine is quite clean - no leaks or anything.  I checked the compression
(after I bought it...) and found the following:

back left - 115         back right -    128
front left - 145        front right -   145
(this is psi measured at full throttle)
I do not have a shop-manual yet so am not sure if these values are within
allowable specs - I would appreciate thoughts on the matter.  The engine is
smooth, starts well, no plug fouling or anything else nasty.

I also suspect that the Vanagon needs a new clutch.  I got a quote from my
local auto parts place for $176 for a clutch 'kit' - consisting of clutch
plate, pressure plate and release bearing.  Is this a good price?  It looks
quite simple to do the clutch job (pulling the gearbox forward off the
engine... is this right?)  How long will this job take (I'd do it myself).
Another motivation for this job is to replace the worn out driveshaft boots
- a very nasty job |-((
Sometimes it is difficult to put the car in 1st gear  -  could this be
because the clutch is not fully disengaging?  The clutch feels kind of weird
- its not at all smooth and the gear linkage seems indistinct...

Another question is the oil drain plug.  This is quite strange since it has
a hex wrench fitting and not a conventional (bolt) style plug like the
illustration in the owners manual.  The previous owner also appeared to have
wound a bit of teflon tape arround the plug(??)

Last questions - is there a good mail order Vanagon parts house?  And where
is the best place to buy a shop manual?  I will need to have it before I do
the clutch next weekend.
Thanks in advance for any help!
Cheers MIKE
1986 Vanagon
