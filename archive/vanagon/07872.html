 &gt; A while back their was a thread regarding &quot;interchangability&quot; of vanagon 
 &gt; driver and passenger seats with other car seats, ie. Audi 4000? 
 &gt; Any more info? Anybody installed non-stock seats? 

  I got a nice pair of MkII Astra seats from a scrappy for 15 quid. 
 Fitting the passenger side seat was just a case of drilling and
 bolting, but for the drivers side I wanted to retain the ability
 to slide the seat back and forwards. I cut the runners from the
 old bus seat and mig welded them onto the new seat frame. The swap
 was definitely worth it in terms of comfort, adjustability of the new
 seats and the fact that you don't stick to them in the summer (yup,
 it does get hot enough over here). Oh and I do sit higher now by
 a couple of inches.
