i was juss sorta crusin' aroun' and found some o' the early stuff... real good.  
primo.  y'all really oughta take a look at &quot;Poems of the First Year&quot; in the 
archives at:
http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/Files/Fridays---Poems-of-the-First-Year

like this fer 'zample:
JABBERWAGEN
by Screwloose Feral [uh, that would be Mr. Walker]

Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves
     Did fyre and syzzle in the van;
All sparkle were the splits and loaves
     And the idle thoughts outran.

&quot;Beware the Jabberwagen bus!
     &quot;The rattles that ne'er cease their speech!
&quot;Beware the Bus-Bus chorus line,
     &quot;And listen not to what they preach!&quot;

He lifted up his greasley tools;
     Long time the irksome rattle sought ...
Til slumbered he by the Half-Fast Tree
     And rested eyes in thought.

... well, it goes on.  refresh yourself and take a visit.  bring a good cup of 
coffee and a friend.
-dan (a little sentimental today)
