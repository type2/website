Subject: Searching for mechanic Chicago area

Help!
We have an 84 Vanagon and are in search of a reputable mechanic in the
Chicago/Evanston area.  We are just passing through, have had some trouble
fixed by an unknown mechanic and want the van checked out by a recomended
person.  Got any favorite mechanics out there?  Thanks for your help,
commiseration, empathy, prayers, chanting, sand paintings, et cetera.
Felicia and William
