Subject: Anyone Want a '65 single cab?
Date: Thu, 8 Feb 1996 10:50:54 -0800 (PST)

Hey!

	The '56 single cab that I told evryone about a week or so ago is
still for sale.  Seems the kid couldn't come up with the cash, so its
still there.  (Sorry Mitch)

* '65 single cab
* no smog!
* double cargo doors!
* pretty straight body, gates are decent - he can get you new gates if you want
* rebuilt transmission and reduction boxes
* new brakes
* fairly new engine
* has minor rust in cargo area, not too bad.
* all glass, lights, interior, etc complete
* $1500

Benji, (209) 748-5411

he also has that '59 bug...

He's moving and really wants to sell it...
