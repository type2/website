Subject:      FS: 85 westy in San Antonio, TX

i was talking on the phone to one of the folks i met up at St. Louis, and
he said he knows a fellow who is trying to sell his camper:

1985 Vanagon Westfalia, 30,000 miles, air-conditioning, after-market cruise
     control, power steering, MIDDLE SEAT OPTION (so it's a 5-passenger).
     $8500 (he's asking). San Antonio, TX (210) 945-4496, ask for Mark.


usual disclaimers from me, of course: never seen the bus, never talked to
the owner/seller, never inhaled, never set foot in San Antonio (cept that
once, when i wuz REALLY drunk!), etc., etc., etc.

joel
