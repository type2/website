&gt;  
&gt; The front bumper comes in three sections just like the 
&gt; originals and the finish is superb. The price is about 70 pounds 
&gt; each, which is alot, but new Brazilian bumpers for a '77 will 
&gt; cost you about 60 pounds each. The fact is you can't buy new 
&gt; bumpers for a '71, over here anyway. 
&gt;  
&gt; If you interested I can dig out his number. 
 
me,me,meeeeeeeeeeeeeee please.
I need the steps for my front bumper, mine have long gone....
