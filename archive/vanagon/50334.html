Subject: canvas water/mold proofing

Does anyone know of a treatment that can be applied to the canvas
pop-top to minimize mold formation and maximize water repellancy?
 
I'm concerned about the fall and spring seasons when condensation is
most likely and the temperatures are high enough to form mold.  In the
summer, the top is up frequently enough to ensure that the canvas is
mostly dry.  In the winter, the top is down and the temperature is
usually below freezing.
