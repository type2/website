Subject: Re: performance engine question

&gt;I am about to send my stock 1600 case to the shop.  I was thinking of getting
&gt;a performance rebuild kit  It will be a 1776 stock  kit with a 110 cam
&gt;substitution.  The Heads will have 39mm intake and 32mm exhaust valves all
&gt;with heavy duty springs.  My question is,  will my compression ratio be all
&gt;messed up and will I need shims to clear up this problem. if I need shims how
&gt;do i know what size.    Thanks for any help.

To find the correct shim size, you have to actually be building the thing 
yourself.  I found the correct size whaen I had the P&amp;C's on.  You have to 
measure the deck height, the head's combustion chamber volume and calculate 
the volume which the piston will sweep.  You can't anticipate the correct 
shim size, because of all the variables which are involved.

As to the right C.R.- You'll get as many answers as there are people to ask. :-)

Hope this helps.
