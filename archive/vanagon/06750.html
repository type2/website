Yes, I think we should plan on a late dinner, so that as many people
as possible from our group will have had the chance to drive/arrive, etc.
The only rule is that we have to get the fish chowder cooked before
our vans turn into pumpkins, ok?  

Remember that if you're planning to arrive after 2 p.m. on Friday,
you might want to phone ahead to Pfeiffer and let them know that, so
that they will hold your reservation for you.  

I've heard back from at least 5 people regarding the potluck.  Keep
up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
