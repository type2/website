Subject: Engine assembly complete, it's in, it's dead? [T1]

Hello everybody.

Over the last 1.5 months or so I've been working on my '67 Rusty's engine.
Nothing major, just replacing push-rod tubes, seals, etc.  Well, when I was
putting the heads back on I noticed that about 50% of the head bolts were
stripped out.  2 of them actually stick out an inch or so farther than the
others.  In my zest to reassemble the engine (first time, you know) I
torqued them all to spec and assumed it would be ok.  When I originally took
the valve covers off some head bolts were rattling around in there but I
just ignored it.

Ok, I finally got it all put together and in the bus.  I forgot some
essential stuff like hooking up the fuel line, running +12V to the coil,
making sure my fuel filter was pointed the right direction, etc. but got it
all squared away and started it up.  Yes!  It works!  Drove it for about 5-8
miles and parked it in the driveway.  I did some messing around with the
idle and some minor stuff and now it won't start!  I popped off the valve
covers and the middle-lower head nuts (yes, the stripped ones) are
finger-tightenable.  Doh!  My expert opinion is:  the heads worked
themselves loose enough to prevent adequate compression so the engine won't
start.  I got it sort of running once and heard a 'pinging' sound from
around the #1 area.

I checked the RMMW catalog and new head studs are ~ $30 for a set.  Cheap,
no problem.  How the hell do I replace them?  When I took the engine apart
before I left the case intact...not as easy this time, right?  Is this
something that I should take the engine to a shop for or what?  I'm getting
the urge to buy a trashed Beetle with a decent motor and just be done with it.

Ugh.
