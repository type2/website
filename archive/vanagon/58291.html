&lt;&lt; Although VW listed different T/O bearing part numbers in their original 
 fiche, these parts are no longer sold by Sachs (the original supplier to 
 Volkswagen).  The only one listed by Sachs is their part number SN31846, 
 designated as a direct OEM replacement for use in all Vanagons, plus busses 
 and bugs from '71.  I suppose maybe you could get the original one from 
 Volkswagen themselves, but I've never tried myself, and don't anyone who 
 has.  If you buy a Sachs T/O bearing from a FLAPS or mail-order 
 distributor, no matter how much you pay or what they call it, you're likely 
 to get the universal one because it is the one Sachs sells for this 
 application.  That said, I've used the Sachs T/O bearing in every late 
 busses and vanagon I've ever had, and never had one fail except after a 
 *lot* of miles. &gt;&gt;

Ditto here on this end.  VW originally sold this release bearing under Part
Number 088-141-165A but has long since superseded it to the Bug Number
(113-141-165B) quite a long time ago, something like '90 or '91.  So don't
let anyone try to fool you that there''s a &quot;special&quot; VW Number or price for
it.  Caveat Emptor :)
