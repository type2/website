&gt; OK, I've heard from at least 15 of you who are

&gt; summer, say, at the Ben and Jerry's event, but for

&gt; that the ones of you interested in doing something this August
&gt; form your own sub-group, and that the rest of you (us) plan on
&gt; 1995 summer, which seems to be the favored time of year.

I second the August 1995 idea. Plenty of time to plan...
