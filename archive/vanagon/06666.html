Subject: Re: Midwest/Midlands Busathon

OK I haven't been following very closely, but as far as I can tell, 
there's a real trip going to happen in CA this winter, an imaginary (in 
the works) trip covering the whole country slated for later, and a murmur 
or two about a midwest equivalent of the CA thing.  Sorry if I've got it 
all wrong.
ANYWAY, I thought I'd mention that there's an event in the St. 
Louis area on Memorial Day weekend called Buses By The Arch.  They do it 
twice a year--Memorial and Labor Days--and I stopped by for a couple of 
hours this Labor Day and it looks like a pretty fun thing.
SO this might be something to consider in planning the BIG TOUR or the 
SMALLER midwest thing.
OR it could be something everyone knows about already.  Or something no 
one cares about at all...But there it is.
If anyone _does_ care about it, and wants to know more, just let me 
know--I'm sure I've got the address of the coordinator-type-guy here 
somewhere...
