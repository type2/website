&gt; &gt;&gt; You have discovered the difference in the heater boxes. On the bug
&gt; &gt;&gt; the cables connect down below. The bus connections are on top. There
&gt; &gt;&gt; is a kit that you can buy to make the modification.

&gt; Yeah, I'm interested in this, too.  I got new heat exchangers but the old
&gt; ones were just wired open so I don't know how they're supposed to be hooked
&gt; up.  The pictures in the Bentley I've got seem to show the connection on the
&gt; bottom, which someone else pointed out won't reach the cables.

I installed a new cable in my bus a while back, and it didn't reach either.
I McGuyver'd it with a couple of pieces of the old wire, and all is warm.

Have no idea about this &quot;connecting on top&quot; stuff
