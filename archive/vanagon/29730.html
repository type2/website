My alternator (the 90 amp model that comes with mid to late model Vanagons)
puts out about 13.9 volts. A few months ago, you wrote to me email saying
that this voltage seemed too low and that it ought to be higher. But I
checked Bentley and it specifies that the regulator is working properly if
it is operating anywhere from 13.5 to 14.5 volts. 

I would love to turn the voltage up higher, especially since I am running a
marine battery as one of my batteries. These marine batteries require higher
voltage than normal automotive batteries to charge properly so I have been
advised I will never be able to charge them enough. 
============================
I have a Bosch alternator (in a non-VW) that was not putting out a high enough
voltage to keep a Delco Freedom battery (the kind with the green dot built in
charge indicator) charged according to the &quot;green eye&quot;.  The alternator tested
fine, but the output voltage was kinda low, around 13 volts if I remember, so
I was able to replace the stock regulator (that mounts on the alternator case
and carries the brushes) with an adjustable model.  This has a little hole for
a screwdriver to adjust the output voltage setting.  Got it an a
starter/alternator repair shop.  I set the output voltage for around 14.3 with
a load on it and the battery charged up nicely and stayed that way over time.
