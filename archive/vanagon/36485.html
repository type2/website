Subject: Camping this weekend?

Hi All,
	With this great weather we are having, my family and I have 
decided to head up to Deciption Pass for Friday and Saturday nights.
If you can get away for the weekend, come on by.  I have a cream colored 
vanagon westy with the group sticker on the rear hatch.  There are a few 
short hikes in the area, go for kids.

	Good Luck.
	johnny Stutsman
