Subject:       Cylinder #s &amp; firing order?

A currently off-list member asked me about the cylinder numbering on 
the w/b, which is of course the same as all VW boxers, right?

So, wanting to be certain about this, I checked the Bentley. It gives 
the firing order as 1-4-3-2 (I think, same as the inline 4s, right), 
but nowhere could I find reference to what cylinder is where.

I think it's 1-3 &amp; 2-4 for left &amp; right side, front to rear, but just 
need to know for sure.

Thanks.

ps: For you old hands who can adjust valves in your sleep, just 
consider this humurous Friday content, ok?
