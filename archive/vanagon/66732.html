Subject:      Re: Sachs Clutch Chatter

I had a Sach's put in by someone other than my regular mechanic.  He =
said since I was supplying the parts he would not warranty the job.  2 =
months later it starts to chatter.  That was a year ago and I still =
don't feel like coughing up the $$$ to replace it.  Now it seems many =
others out that have had the same problem.  (this is like the &quot;hey my =
van squeaks under the passenger seat too&quot; problem from last winter). =20

Does anyone know how to contact Sach's about the recall?

Thanks,
Bryan
