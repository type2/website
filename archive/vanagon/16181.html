Subject: Re: [WTB] Rocker Panels, 72'...

&gt;  I am tackling the body of my 72' these next few weeks, and I'm
&gt; wondering if anyone has or knows where I can get rocker panels (inner
&gt; and outer, both sides). Whitney seems like a rip-off (maybe just CAN$
&gt; exchange rate?!), and I don't trust off-shore (maybe someone can
&gt; convince me otherwise!). Its true, this is a shot in the dark, but I
&gt; really want to get rid of all that crusty metal and make my Bus look
&gt; shiney new. 
&gt;

Out of curiosity, try the dealer. I got a couple of pieces to rebuild the 
sliding door rocker/track cheap when I lived in Waterloo Ont. Still needed 
to fab up some extras to do the job. There are two inner ribs + the outer 
rocker, check what you need. You need to do good work on sliding door side, 
else it will fall out if the fitting isn't spot on and parallel to roof 
track! Try phoning Hayman (Heyman?) Volkswagen in Newmarket just north of 
Toronto, they carry LOTS of stuff, their prices weren't real great. They 
have scrap vans too I think. tim s.
