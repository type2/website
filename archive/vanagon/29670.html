&gt; The ride went well, but an old problem (from when this engine was in the '78)

&gt; and how do I solve this ?
&gt; My immediate thought was flooding, so I searched in the Bentley book but
&gt; could only find &quot;Engine stalls when accelerator pedal is released
&gt; suddenly&quot; (page 3-12) but this obviously isn't it.
&gt; 

I recently experienced a similar problem and now know it was related to 
timing, effected by my distributor shaft being incorrectly installed. 
Once I adjusted my timing (way out), the stalling when I accelerate 
ceased. You might look at the Finding TDC posts and go from there to see 
if your distributor is actually installed a notch or two off.

Good luck! Joe
