Subject: Re: 1987 High Idle - $3.13 Fix


&gt;Meanwhile I was pursuing repairing the bad module.  Inside the module I
&gt;discovered two components that were suspect.  The first one, a voltage
&gt;stabilizer transistor was definitely fried.  I found (from my 88 Vanagon
&gt;module) a company logo: SGS in tall narrow letters pushed up against
&gt;eachother &amp; other numbers were BD 438 and 9  741.  I found that an ECG or NTE
&gt;185 was a replacement component for it.  The other component was a rectifier
&gt;diode that had some signs of being overheated but was not overtly fried as
&gt;the other component had been.  The diode had the numbers  GP15G-7001 and GI
&gt;   8641.  I thingk the GI is for General Instruments.  Well, found that it
&gt;could be replaced with an NTE 125 or ECG 125.
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday, I installed the two new components and the bottom line is that
&gt;after poping the module back in, my van idles normally again!  :)
&gt;
&gt;Cost?
&gt;NTE185:   $2.25
&gt;NTE125:     $.88
&gt;
&gt;Total:       $3.13 + tax
&gt;
&gt;Compared to dealer list, I saved about $205. - that's 98.5% less!!  :)   :)
&gt;  :)
&gt;So now I've gone from needing a new module to having a spare for future use.

Alright Jim!!  thats what I try to do, repair the part instead of replace
it. (electrical)  This is good information.  I have replace the little
instrument lights with grain of wheat bulbs from Radio Shack.  I don't have
the number handy but if anyone is interested I'll dig it up.  I have also
repaired a faulty head light switch and back up light switch, just by
disassembley and a little ingenuity.
