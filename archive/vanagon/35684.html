  Well I for one am a climber. It was the original reason I bought
  my '70 bus. Things were getting silly, two up on a motorbike with
  climbing and camping gear was a bit of a nightmare. So I looked 
  around for a van that would fit onto the drive (and that I could 
  afford), and hey presto, one VW.

  The trouble was, the original idea of going climbing/camping
  with the bus at weekends turned into mending/maintenance at the
  weekend and going down the climbing wall during the week.

  The bus has earned its keep though. Its taken me to the English Lake
  District, Wales, Peak district and Devon among others on climbing trips.
  As most of the other climbers have tents and small cars, the bus
  also ends up as a kind of mobile living room, with everyone crammed
  in at the end of the day.

  I've also belayed from it in the past, on various roadside crags.
  I would open the sliding door and sit on the floor edge whilst paying
  out the rope. If you're going to be the second you might as well do
  it in style.
