Subject: Re: Emissions, engine swaps, full-flow filters, 76 balls

Bob writes about poorly fitting full-flow-filter adaptors. How come
nobody imports the spin-on-filter adaptor I saw on a stock beetle engien
at the VW dealer in Tijuana? Does it not fit old cases?

tell me more!  This sounds interesting.

BTW, i remember, from about 5 years ago, seeing a 72 bus in England with a
1600 in it.  This seemed wierd to be at the time, as i had never heard of
such a thing.  But the point here was that it had a screw in oil filter.  No
messy hoses.  Thought it pretty neat.    

I'd like to find a case like that.  =)
