Subject: 82 Vanagon gearbox swap ?
Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 21:27:42 +0100 (MET)

I own a 1982 crewcab with a broken 4-speed gearbox.

I am about to replace it...

Can I replace it with a 5-speed gearbox ?

Can/should I use the 5-speed gearbox from a diesel wanagon ?

Can/should I use the 5-speed gearbox from a wassserboxer ?

Is it worth the trouble or should I just get a new 4-speed gearbox ?

Figures on gear ratios, finaldrive ratios and other stuff for the
different gearboxes would be nice...
