&gt; As a result I am now $5,700 poorer but the proud (and very happy) owner of a
&gt; Nautilus Red 89 Syncro Westfalia. It has 120K mi, new front CVJ's...

	I am in awe of your blessedness.  Anyone that can find a west coast 89
Syncro Westy for $5,700 can probably walk between the raindrops of a
thunderstorm and not get wet.  I paid $10,000 for my '87 Syncro Westy
here on the east coast and I thought I got an incredible deal.
