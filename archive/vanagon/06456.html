Subject: Re: I Bought the '85 Vanagon!!!!
Date: Thu, 10 Nov 1994 22:12:12 -0500 (EST)

&gt; 
&gt; I did it!  I got the 1985 Vanagon today, left the Passat at work and 
&gt; drove it home this evening.  Thanks to everyone who responded to my 
&gt; queries about this vehicle.
&gt; 

	Congratulations! - Hopefully this is just the beginning. :) or :(
	depending on your temperament :-)

&gt; A couple of issues:
&gt; 
&gt; I need an owner's manual!  I called around to a couple of the VW dealers 
&gt; here in Metropolitan Atlanta and had no luck.  Jim Ellis said they could 
&gt; order one but were not encouraging, if they could find one it could take 
&gt; months to show up according the parts person.  Is there some kind soul in 
&gt; the Atlanta area that could lend me theirs for the purpose of 
&gt; photocopying?
&gt; 

	I saw one for sale (could give you directions) for $84.00.  I
	bought mine for &gt; $90...

&gt; surprise!!! quite by accident).  I suppose I should get a service manual 
&gt; for the thing but Bentley is really expensive--will Haynes do?

	I don't think Haynes makes one for an 85.  I believe they 
	stopped _at_ 83. Plus, Bentley's the one.  It's worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; What I really need is the grand tour of this thing--any takers in Atlanta?-- 
&gt; 

	I bought my 84 about 5 months ago...I don't know much, but maybe
	we can help each other out...?
