Subject: A winter VW question/f

No bill:  the moment happens traveling up hill in the EV, in a snow storm,
on an unplowed road with 10&quot; on the ground. EV has ground to a halt as as
a) the weight transfer off the drive wheels has reduced traction to &quot;0&quot;,
and b) you don't have snow tires because they are &quot;nasty&quot; on FWD vehicles.


An air cooled bus with snow tires blows by, the driver doesn't stop to
offer help as he can't see you through the frost covered side windows...

THAT'S the moment.....
