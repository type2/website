Subject: Really WEIRD electrical quirk

OK here's one boys and girls, finally get the '85 on the road for the 
first time time in months, well neato problem springs up, the van 
stays solidly in high idle (2000 rpm) no matter how long running, 
etc, UNTIL you put on the parking brake at which time it immediately 
drops to proper idle.  As a possible side consequence the brake light 
does not light.  I made a critical error when reinstalling the 
starter of forgetting to put the battery cable on the starter, put 
merely the main switched power cable and the switch lead on (hey it was 
2:00 am and it took me 3-4 clicks of the switch to figure it out), 
that also was oddly the last time I recall the brake light igniting 
which it did while trying to crank in that configuration, so I ask, 
what did I fry, aside from this slight annoyance it is running just 
fine, hell with less missing than previously.
