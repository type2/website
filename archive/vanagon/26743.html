Subject: Thermostat setup wanted

Well since my '62 Kombi wended its way up to the frozen
north via California, somebody along the way decided that
swift engine warmup was of no concern and removed the
whole thermostat setup.  

My engine is a 1600dp but the fan is not a doghouse.  I'm
guessing I could use either the later balancing flap setup
or the early ring-shaped-thing-in-front-of-the-fan.  

Surely one of you hot-weather folks has a big pile
of unused unwanted thermostat/etc. parts.  Let's deal!

If anyone has a complete doghouse shroud and fan they
want to sell, I'm interested in that also.
