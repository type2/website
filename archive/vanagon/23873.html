Subject: Death to VW Vandals

Well I need to blow off a little steam and I guess here is the best place
because you all can understand how outraged I am.  Woke up this morning to see
that my 69 bus had been moved.  Take a closer look and noticed that my
driverside wing window is shattered.   I then start to wounder hey what
happend.  Take an even closer look.  The front end where the tire is is all
bent up.  Look down and notice that the parking block that seperates my van to
  the Ravine is gone. I then see that 10 to 15 feet down the Ravine that a tree
has a chunck out of it and there are tire tracks going into the tree.  
Emergency Brake failure.
nope. Just fixed it. Well I then came to the conclusion that some idiot thought
it would be neet to push a Bus down a ravine.  This is the only conclusion I
can come up with considering that I left it in gear and the brake was set plus
I put a small block under the wheels.  The stearing wheel lock was broken so it
could be steared.  And the broken window glass shows that the window was broken
in a different place than when it crashed into the ravine.  Sorry for rambling,
 But I am outraged.  The police said nothing can be doen unless I can find
witnesses to who did it.  The police had it pulled out early in the mornig and
left no note so then when I get to it,  I am confused as hell saying I forgot
the parking brake until my landlord said that it had to have been pushed
becasue the parking block had to be lifted out of the way.  I am unsure of the
damage report at this time.  Front nose is dented and so it driver side.
Window is broken and so is the stearing wheel lock, which brings me to an even
bigger problem,  The ingintion is lock and It can't be undoen presently becaus
the strearing lock is busted.  Any Ideas on how to disconect the ingition lock.
Usuall yyou just turn the wheel slightly and turn the key, but since the wheel
lock is busted that dont work.  Well sorry for the wasted band with but I now
feel a little better.  In all I now feel there should be the Death Penalty to
those who  vandalize VW.

Thanks
Brad
