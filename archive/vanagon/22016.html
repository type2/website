You've GOTTA get a copy of John Muir's How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive 
(A Guide For The Compleat Idiot) plus a Bentley manual and maybe a Haynes 
manual. Bentley will have hard data, the idiot book will help you with 
the frustrating parts... you'll want a laptop, a cell phone and a 
cellular modem to receive vanagon_at_lenti information, too...  : ' )

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought a '72 Westy and I am thinking about a trip to Texas from
&gt; Seattle.  I would like any advice about camping on the road and not getting
&gt; arrested for loitering.  I was also wondering if anybody has a good list of
&gt; emergency items that a bus might consume on a trip across the rockies. I am
&gt; also looking for a book that might make repairs on the side of the road
&gt; easier.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are between Seattle and Texas waive when I go by,
