&gt;&gt;Yuck!  I can't believe they're going to ruin hundreds of old VW buses
&gt;&gt;like that!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;They'll probably sell the buses back (or auction) but the buses will be
&gt;&gt;torn to crap by the time the Border Patrol gets done with them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm really disgusted by this news.
&gt;
&gt;        Now why the heck cant the BP just buy Mexican busses???!!! Probably
&gt;cheaper, and if they *really* want stealth busses, Mexican plates will
&gt;really make 'em look innocent. I dunno if the Mex. Government would be cool
&gt;with the idea, but it would certainly be worth a shot...


Same reason we can't-- illegal to bring them into the U.S. Don't meet 
federal
standards for emissions, taillight size, restraints, etc.
