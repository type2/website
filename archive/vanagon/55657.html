Subject: '87 low RPM/idle - (mostly) fixed, THANKS!


Thanks to all who responded about my low RPM questions. I checked out my
throttle switch and it was not switching at all in the idle
position. I've readjusted it by eye/sound/feel and it's made a huge
difference in the idle and decelleration.

I still have a few other items to check out:

	vacuum hoses
	idle stabilizer
	coolant temp sensor

Aloha and mahalo!

Gordon
