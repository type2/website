&gt; Ok, some of you have told me about rebuilding your auto stop-fill valves
&gt; with a rebuild kit from Mancester.  Question for you is, were your

&gt; brass ones are rebuildable and of course, mine is aluminum!  Help!  I
&gt; don't really want to replace the whole tank.

Hey, did I miss something?  Is this a valve that stops the fuel from
running down the side of the van when filling?  I know we discussed this
problem but there was no clear solution.

TIA
