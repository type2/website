Subject: [T3] flywheel question...

Doing a clutch pressure plate/friction plate/flywheel replacement on my '90
Vanagon GL.  My VW guru, Herbie, gave me a reconditioned flywheel (he was
retiring from active duty and cleaning out his shop (Waaaaaaahhhhhh!)) but
the P/Ns on the backs of the two are not identical.

The factory flywheel has four small areas with numbers forged or cast into
them, but none of them are full-length VW part numbers.

The reconditioned flywheel has much larger numbers cast/forged/stamped into
it, but none of them are identical to the factory unit.

To all appearances they are identical, except for the numbers and number
placement.  Unfortunately, I don't have the numbers written down yet.

The factory unit has a nine-digit P/N on it.  Something like 205 XXX 125.
The reconditioned unit has something like 205 125.
The point - does the middle number matter, in this case?

Does anyone have a cross-reference for the various flywheels that can go in
'90 GLs (gas, four-speed)?

Please cc any responses to my address, as I have trouble finding time to
read the entire list every day.
