Subject: Manuals

Don't know if anyone's interested in this, but I was at a used bookstore
yesterday and came across the following:

A very beat up 1980-1991 Bentley Vanagon manual, Blue cover, looks like a dog
chewed it. 
They want $20 for it 
A clean 1980-1983 Bentley Vanagon manual $15
A clean Bentley for Type II (went up to 79) $15
An old Muir book, Black and White cover, spiral bound $8
A book called &quot;how to hot rod your VW&quot; (I think this was $8)

If anyone is interested, I would be happy to arrange to get them and send them.
Please e-mail me directly.

Happy New Year!
