 I looked in the owners manual for my '74 and it says it can use leaded, low-
 lead or unleaded gas that is 91 octane or higher. When we used to be able to
 get leaded gas &lt;I was told that there wasn't much lead left in it by the time
 it was taken off the market&gt; I ran leaded in cool weather on flat ground, the
 octane level being only 89. The bus has subsisted well on premium unleaded, 
 octane level 92 - The engine has 108,000 miles on it now.
