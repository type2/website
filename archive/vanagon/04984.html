&gt; I'm another newbie who's joined the list before buying. In my case, I'm
&gt; looking to buy a bread-loaf camper, probably a 75-78 based on what I've
&gt; learned so far.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to J. Walker, I have a file that describes the changes made to each
&gt; model year of bus (that information is what leads me to want a 75-78
&gt; bread-loaf). That file doesn't contain any camper-specific information, and
&gt; when I asked him, he told me he didn't have that kind of info and I should go
&gt; to the group.
&gt; 
&gt; Do any of you have a file containing information about different camper
&gt; &quot;models&quot;, and what equipment was actually included with each? I guess I'm
&gt; mostly interested in the second generation buses, but I'm curious about
&gt; earlier and later models.
