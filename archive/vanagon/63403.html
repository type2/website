&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This one is pretty funny.......edited for VW relevence...
&gt;&gt; ------------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  A man goes out and buys the best vehicle available in the US or Europe, a
&gt;&gt; 1991 Vanagon with a Subaru engine swap. It is the fastest and most expensive
&gt;&gt; vehicle in the world(well, at least in repair costs:&gt;). He takes it out
&gt;&gt;for a &gt;&gt; spin and, while doing so,stops for a red light.  An old  man on
&gt;&gt;a moped,
&gt;&gt; looking about 90 years old, pulls up next to him.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the vehicle and asks,
&gt;&gt; &quot;What kind of van ya got there, sonny?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The dude replies, &quot;A 1991 Vanagon with a Subaru motor. They cost $500,000!&quot;
&gt;&gt; (well ,they do if you buy parts at the dealer, right? hey go with
&gt;&gt; the story, OK?)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  &quot;That's a lotta money!&quot; says the old man, shocked. &quot;Why does it cost  so
&gt;&gt; much?&quot; &quot;Cause this van can do up to 320 miles an hour!&quot; states the cool dude
&gt;&gt; proudly (well, off a cliff, maybe).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The old man asks, &quot;Can I take a look inside?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   &quot;Sure,&quot; replies the owner.  So the old man pokes his head in the window
&gt;&gt; and looks around.  Leaning back on his moped, the old man says, &quot;That's a
&gt;&gt; pretty nice van, alright!&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Just then the light changes, so the guy decides to show the old man what
&gt;&gt; his van can do. He floors it, and within 15 seconds the speedometer reads
&gt;&gt; 320.(wow!)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Suddenly, the guy notices a dot in his rear view mirror.  It seems to be
&gt;&gt; getting closer!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Whhhoooooooooossssshhhhhh!  Something whips by him! Going maybe 3 times
&gt;&gt; as fast!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The guy pulls over to the side of the road, totally confused, and wonders
&gt;&gt; what on earth could be going faster than his modified vanagon!  Then, up
&gt;&gt; ahead of him, he sees a dot coming towards him like a bat out of hell!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Whooooooooooosh!  It goes by again and it sort of looks like the old man
&gt;&gt; on the moped!  That couldn't be,  the guy thinks.  How could a moped outrun a
&gt;&gt; Subaru/Vanagon?  Again, he sees a dot coming towards him in his rear view
&gt;&gt; mirror!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Whooooooooshhhhhhhh  Ka-BlaMMMMM!  It plows into the back of his van,
&gt;&gt; demolishing the rear end(and the subaru motor to boot).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The guy jumps out, and be damned if it isn't the old man!  Of course,
&gt;&gt;  the moped is smashed all over the place and the old man is hurting for
&gt;&gt;  certain.  The guy runs up to the old man and asks &quot;You're hurt bad! Is there
&gt;&gt;  anything I can do for you?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   The old man replies &quot;Yeah - unhook my suspenders from your side-view
&gt;&gt; mirror...&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hope this version makes you laugh as much as the original did me...
