Subject: How to Cut The Dash?

The dash of my '60 camper has been slightly mutilated
by the previous owner.  Specifically, the radio hole was
cut to fit an old cruddy Kraco.  Some holes were also
made during this same process.

If and when I find an old split with a clean dash in a
junk yard, I would like to know where on the &quot;new&quot; dash I should
make the cuts for a clean replacement.
Also, since I have zero welding experience, what is
the best way to perform this kind of surgery?

What I envision is me hacking out the replacement dash
with some metal cutting tool, then handing the bus and the
new part over to some metal master for skillful insertion.

Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

Danny D.
