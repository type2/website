&gt; 
&gt;      Here we go again,
&gt;      
&gt;      After a long (80 miles) drive last week I decided that something
&gt;      had to be done to my '64 heating system. It's got brand-new heater
&gt;      boxes, with new pipes and it's all wonderfully sealed and it's CRAP!
&gt;      

Oops!  Re-read you message (after I replied, of course) and noticed the 
80 mile commute part.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, still you should have
your control flaps installed and working with the thermostat if you want
decent heat.  Other than that, the seals in your windows/doors should be
in good shape and sealing to retain the heat.

That's all,

Steven
