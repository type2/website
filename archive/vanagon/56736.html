Subject: WB running hot

I just replaced my coolant temperature sensor and I replaced the temp
sender as well. Now my gauge sit to the right to a needle width past when
driving. It used to be in the middle of the light. I bleed the system but
it still happens. Could the sender be bad. I just took out the old one and
put in the new one. There are no leaks and the wire is securely connected.
Any ideas. Also, about my other posts about the idle problem. My fuel pump
is making a whining noise. Is this its death shriek? Thanks


Dave
