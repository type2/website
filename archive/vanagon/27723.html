Subject: Re: New seals for slave cylinder?


&gt;My '85 is dripping brake fluid from the clutch slave cylinder. I
&gt;thought I might just try replacing the seals. I tried doing this
&gt;several years ago on an old Datsun's brake slave cylinder but it leaked
&gt;soon afterward. Anyone have luck with the cheap approach or should I do
&gt;it right and just buy a new one.

Personally, I chronically suck at honing cylinders, a necessary part
of rebuilding one and re-sealing. If it were me, I'd buy a rebuilt one
from the local VW FLAPS, trade in the old, and be happy I didn't have
to spring for a brand-new one.

If you have good experience at rebuilding these things, though, by all
means go for it. I'm a shade-tree mechanic at best. YMMV, bigtime.
