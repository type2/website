Subject: Whistle sound--Gland nut??

Hi!

I have a new sound I could use some help decoding on my '71.  It's a subtle 
high pitched (whistle like) sound that doesn't appear to be directly 
related to wheel speed.  It occurs in all gears (well, I'm sure of 2-4, but 
the engine revs in 1st might drown it out) but does go away when I press 
the clutch in at least half way. 

The clutch cable is properly adjusted and I replaced the flex tube, lever 
and lever pin as well as the gear shift rod a few weeks ago (coincidence?).
These parts weren't giving me any trouble at the time of replacement, I 
just finally go around to replacing them after noticing a  month ago 
that they were looking worn (when I replaced a frayed clutch cable).

The clutch and pressure plate have less than 10k miles on them.  The gland 
nut has 60k plus on it and that is why I'm  suspicious of it.  Does this sound 
like worn bearings in the gland nut?

I checked the trans. fluid, but only had to add a little.  This had no 
effect on the sound.  What do you think?  If it is the gland nut, what are 
the implications of letting this condition persist.  The sound has been 
with me two weeks or so with no sign of getting worse or diminishing.  

Thanks,

Ron
