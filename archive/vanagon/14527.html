Not so much selling out as trying to be noticed.
Mr. Biff Yuppie always thought that VW vans were ugly so when he and
his wife Buffy Yuppie popped out a couple of yupplets they looked into
the North American Mini-van line and completely ignored the VWs.
By trying to look a little more ( a lot more in some opinions ) like
these American mini-craps they hoped to be able to get into that market
but still hold on to us VW lovers by offering a superior product.

They should have kept the Vanagon as well though. IMO(NS)HO
