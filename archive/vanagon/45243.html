Subject: Re: Help-83 pop top seal

Mike,
I got mine from:

Parts Place (Recycled Bugs)
2300 N Opdyke
Auburn Hills, MI 48326
(810)373-2300
(810)373-5950 fax

The price was:

US$49.95 for the luggage rack seal - part# 8-231-831-709
US$109.95 for the pop top seal - part# 8-231-831-710

plus US$8.30 shipping and handling.

I am pleased with the seal.  It was easier to put on than the original would
be because the part that attaches to the top is made of stiff plastic
instead of having those rusty metal clips inside.  You just put a little 3M
weather stripping cement in the groove, a little on the top and away you go.

Hope this helps,

&gt;out what I should do about it.
&gt;The Problem: My black rubber seal that goes around the bottom of the
&gt;pop-top peice is starting to rot (or a least in spots it is) and peel off.
&gt;        I called the dealership and the replacement is $533. There is no
&gt;way in hell that I would ever pay that so.......has anyone done this repair
&gt;before? I was hoping that I could simply peel off the exsisting
&gt;one...scrape off all the gunk and junk, then reglue it on.
&gt;
&gt;        Inquire mind would like to know.
