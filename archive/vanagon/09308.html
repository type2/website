	Folks,
	I believe we're seeing the first results of the historic 
reorganization of the House of Representitives. These bounces seem
to be coming from their server! It looks like Tom Forhan is/was on this 
list, but that name (as shown below) is no longer recongnized. Did we 
have a member of the G'm'mn't (non-elected) on the list Gerry? Elected??
