Subject: '83 overheating

Good Morning,

My '83 GL is having overheating/cooling problems. To give you a brief 
background, I bought the van 3 months ago. This is my first water 
cooled VW so this whole thing is a mystery to me! At the time of 
purchase, the fuel and water temp guages were not working. I replaced 
the voltage stabilizer and all seemed well. The temp guage read from 
2/3 to 3/4, rising only with very extended idling. Now, the guage rises 
steadily to full mast and the light may or may not blink. I keep 
checking the coolant but it seems fine, the temp from the resevoir 
reads about 190 F when the guage is at full mast. The only work I've 
done since the voltage stabilizer is to replace the alternator.

Can anybody give a basic account of the proper procedures to test and 
'set up' the cooling system?

Thanks!

still learning to swim,
tony
