&gt;3) Who has an opinion (good or bad) on Rocky Mountain Motor Works?  &gt;Decent
&gt;parts?  Decent service?  I'm thinking about buying some electrical &gt;parts

I spent quite a bit of money while doing a five year restoration on my 1956
bug, of which a good portion went to Rocky Mountain Motor Works. In the
beginning these folks were the best. I was especially impressed with the
support they provided. A couple of times the would call me up to provide
updated information on problems they were sorting out for me. Particularly in
replacing the wire loom -I couldn’t figure out the turn signal and semaphore
combination. Anyway, because of this I had great things to say about this
shop. 
	But, about 18 months ago I changed my tune. I have had a number of orders
where without any notification items were not shipped, and minor (yet
annoying) discrepancies with the billing: overcharging $10  here $15 there.
The overcharging was not that big of a problem but what really gets under my
skin is waiting for up to six weeks for overseas delivery only to find
missing items. I kept saying “no problem a fax will sort it out” but, they
don’t answer their faxes. Telephoning isn’t much better. In the end, I figure
there a other people out there willing to a bit more honest and respectful.
To bad. They had a good thing going. One’s only worst off by these lousy
practices.
