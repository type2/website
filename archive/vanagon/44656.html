 After trying everything from using the OEM filter to replacing the sending
 units I bit the bullet and installed a VDO oil press. gauge. Low and behold
I
 have an actual oil press. problem. After  the van reaches operating temp.
the
 gauge reads about 6-9 psi at idle and about 22 psi at highway speeds. This
is
 after a so called reliable dealer assured me that the pressure checked out
at
 32psi.. What I'd like to find is what my options are. The van dosen't burn
 any oil or smoke a bit, and it still gets about 18 mpg on the highway. We've
 taken it on some 1000 mile weekends and it runs like a dream, should I be
 concerned or just let it be? It has about 125,000 miles on it. &gt;&gt;


What viscosity oil are you using?  If you are using 10-30 or 10-40, that is
the problem. Especially with a high miles engine.  Try 20-50.  Make sure the
relief valave is not stickingand has the engine been maintained?  If it is
full of gunk, the pump inlet screen could be clogging.  I've seen this a
number of times.  The only cure id a complete teardown,(YUK).  Maike sure the
cooling system is working properly also and the the oil cooler is getting
water,  Especialy make sure the crankcase is never overfilled.  I have found
that these engines run coolest with the level between the marks.  1/4 inch
above the mark will drive oil temps out of control, even with an external oil
coler,
