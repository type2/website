Subject: Re: Universal Cases

&gt;Does anyone know how to identify a universal case.  I need to find a
&gt;motor for my '69 squareback, and am wondering what to look for when I go
&gt;searching through junkyards.  Type III's are much rarer than busses, so
&gt;assume it would be easier to find a motor from a bug or 68-71 bus.  Am I
&gt;correct to assume that most newly built motors are built with the
&gt;Universal Cases?  
&gt;Actually before I go shelling money out for a new case, I'd be curious
&gt;to know if anyone thinks that my case is rebuildable.  When I bought the
&gt;car it ran okay, but leaked lots of oil.  I suspected push rod tubes/oil
&gt;cooler etc, but when I took the engine tin off, I noticed that all of
&gt;the bolts that held the cases halves together were loose(one had
&gt;actually fallen off).  One mechanic I talked to said that because the
&gt;engine had been run &quot;loose&quot;, the case would never seal right again.  I
&gt;never actually cracked the case to assess the damage, I just bolted it
&gt;back together, but it didn't really help the oil leak problem.  Has
&gt;anyone ever had this happen on a vw motor.  
&gt;
What you might have is a &quot;fretted&quot; case.  You have to look at the case 
sealing surface to see these marks.  (i.e. crack the baby open.)  If this is 
the case, the case is junk.  Pull up a six pack and a couple of buds, and 
roast some marshmallows.

All universal cases I have seen have the letter B with no numbers stamped on 
case. They all have the three bolt holes for the crossmember, and the T3 oil 
filler hole.
