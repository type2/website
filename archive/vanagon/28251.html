Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

&gt;I personally like the babes in bikini's. Yes, I'm a family man over 40,
&gt;but I'm not upset at having to look at scantily clad women on every other
&gt;page. Quite the contrary.
&gt;
OK, I'm with you Cap'n Kirk.  50, but still like to look.  Gotta be careful
my wife doesn't catch me ogling the live girls, but I notice she still
likes the looks, and I still enjoy lookin' at her still quite fine
physique.
