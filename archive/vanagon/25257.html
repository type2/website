So Sami Dakhlia says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if the engine is really new (or is it &quot;just&quot; rebuilt?), then it may
&gt; still be at least about $700 too much. This would be a good price for a
&gt; good Westy, though. In short: there should be better deals out there.
&gt; 
&gt; -- 

I agree with Sami.  The price is probably too.  The 'little rust' is the
first clue I don't like.  I would add to Sami's post that you can't beat
shopping around for getting a good deal.  You should intend only to look
at your first 10 buses/campers before you buy.  That way you get a good
idea of what is a good deal and what is not.  Don't let your eagerness,
take hold of your pocket book.

Spoken from the 'eager pocket book' school of hard knocks.  ;)
