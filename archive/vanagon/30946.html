Subject: Re: Smokin' 'n' leakin' !

&gt;Alright, here are tips that cured my huge oil leak(in my 79):
&gt;1. Change BOTH valve cover gaskets with Brand New ones.
&gt;2. Do oil change with Castrol 10W30.
I've got Valvoline 10-40, which my mech recommends. . .I use 30 for summer only.
&gt;3. Go to VW Dealer, and buy a VW oil filter, and a gasket set for 
&gt;your oil stariner.
&gt;4. Do the oil change wit the above, and USE A TORQUE WRENCH on
&gt;the oil strainer nut.
&gt;This WILL solve a lot of your oil leak, I hope.

I looked under it for a long time and it doesn't seem to be coming from the
strainer region or the valve covers. . .seems to be trickling down from
someplace further back.  Last night I put a tray underneath to collect the
drip, this morning when I go out I'll see how much is in there and pour it
back into the engine till I can do something else.

&gt;About the oil burning in the engine compart:
&gt;After you do the oil change, get the bus started, let warm up,
&gt;and watch for oil leaks out of OIL FILLER NECK.
&gt;If you need any more detailed instructions, don't hesitate to ask.
&gt;Good Luck
&gt;Paul

Yeah, I kinda think it's from the filler neck actually.  Thanx for the advice!

P.S. It ain't only &quot;smokin' 'n' leakin,&quot; it's &quot;stinkin'&quot; too. . .a very
intoxicating aroma of oil/gas fills the inside when I drive it for a while
to the point that I have to open the window.  Somehow this doesn't strike me
as normal either. . .!
