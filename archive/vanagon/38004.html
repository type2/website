&gt;Now that I have a camper that moves under its own power I am going to 
&gt; begin cleaning up the interior. This 78 has the plastic laminate trim 
&gt; in a real oppressive dark color and the front kick panels and 
&gt; headliner are vinyl. I prefer the plywood panels and trim in my old 71 
&gt; and am going to reproduce some panels using Baltic Birch or whatever 
&gt; light vernier plywood I can scrounge.  I think I will whip up some 
&gt; maple cabinets for the van when I am making the cabinets for my new 
&gt; house so that I can sneak them past the watchful eye of my 
&gt; wife/foreman (&quot;your not going out to work on the VW again? Don't you 
&gt; know we have a house to build?&quot;). 
&gt;
&gt;My Question/offer- It wouldn't be much more work to make a template for 
&gt; cutting out the kick panels, headliner and trim versus making a one 
&gt; off set, does any one else wish to install plywood instead of laminate 
&gt; and vinyl? If I can get enough interest I would gladly reproduce these 
&gt; for the masses for a minimum of labor cost and price of wood. If not 
&gt; then I will make one for me and never bring the subject up again.
&gt;
&gt;Also- since I am chief designer of the cabinets I am looking for 
&gt; suggestions on the ultimate layout and configuration. I would gladly 
&gt; listen to any advice about what you would add / subtract from your 
&gt; current setup. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

Since my camper ('71) has pretty decent paneling, I haven't really looked
into this, but one issue is that the headliner panel is slightly wider than
4', perhaps some German standard (?).  I know the hardware stores just carry
4'x8' or smaller; don't know about the speciality lumber stores.  Yeah, you
could just have the grain run the other direction but I guess I'm kind of a
stickler for OEM look so if it came to that I'd rather just keep what I have.
I'd be interested in knowing if you find paneling in larger than 4'x8' sheets,
though.
