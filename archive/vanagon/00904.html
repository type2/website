Subject: electrical systems



anybody out there want to describe the
modifications made to their elec. system?
extra batteries, battery selector switches,
uprgraded wiring etc.

oh and btw, am i the only one who when
seening another van, wonders if the owner is
a subscriber to this group?
(no, i'm not suggesting secret handshakes, or
morse code headlight flashing)

cheers
alistair
