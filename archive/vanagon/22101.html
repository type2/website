             Part III: The Mexican Mainland


In this chapter, we join Tobin and Christa as their ferry arrives 
in Mazatlan on the Mexican mainland...

Christa had met three American surfers on the crossing from La 
Paz, and we offered them a lift into Mazatlan.  They were going to 
be meeting some other surfers there, then work their way down the 
coast always searching for the most radical surf action.  The guy 
in this group (there were two women with him) had been up the 
whole night with some Mexican kids, translating &quot;Hotel California&quot; 
in its entirety into spanish for them.  &quot;It's crazy,&quot; he said, 
with a slightly maniacal look in his eyes, &quot;these Mexicans just 
LOVE this song!  You hear it everywhere.  They can't get enough of 
it.  These kids wouldn't let me go until I'd translated the whole 
thing for them!&quot;  They'd spent the entire night listening to the 
tape the kids had in their boom box over and over.  It was pretty 
obvious he'd been pushed over the edge.

When we docked, the officials wouldn't let us down to the car 
deck: everyone had to walk off the ferry from the passenger decks, 
walk around the ship on the docks to the vehicle loading ramp, and 
re-enter the car deck from there.  We squeezed back into the 
camper, and waited for clearance to proceed.  No one moved.  
Everyone had fired up their engines as soon as they got into their 
vehicles, and the car deck quickly become complete filled up with 
dense smoke and exhaust fumes from a ship-full of badly-tuned 
idling engines.  We kept our windows rolled up in spite of the 
oppressive heat.  No one motioned the traffic forward, but the 
truck in front of us made a break for it.  Almost immediately, all 
hell broke loose.  All 6 lanes of traffic from the car deck were 
fighting to get off the single lane ramp.  There still was no 
traffic direction.  The fumes were only getting worse, and the sun 
from outside cut through the smoke in stark shafts of light 
illuminating everything in a dim pale blue-gray hue.  I threw our 
camper into gear, cut off every car around me, and shot off the 
car deck.  

God!  We could breathe!  We rolled down the windows and headed 
over to the passenger area and loaded 3 surfers, 3 boards, and all 
their stuff into our westy.  We fed our surfer friends some cheese 
and crackers, shared the rest of our juice, and drove into town.  
We wound along narrow, curving streets until we hit the main drag 
along the beach.  

Driving the beach strip was a trippy experience: we were in 
America again, passing Arby's, McDonalds, the Hilton...  all the 
elements of American generica were there, but somehow even the 
artificiality and homogeneity of all this seemed fake, like a 
streetscape constructed for a Hollywood movie set. It was like 
post-modernism had turned on itself, and icons of the fakeness of 
North American pop culture had been reconstructed here, yet rung 
all the more hollow because of it.  No, I decided, post-modernism 
was not destroying itself in Mazatlan.  Quite the opposite: 
perhaps post-modernism was deconstructing its own text, which was 
kind of neat--faking fakes of fakes of fakes--or maybe these were 
_representations_ and weren't fakes at all?  Hmmm... that changed 
everything.  I thought I'd better concentrate on driving before I 
crashed into something.  (But what would I drive into?  How would 
I interpret the resulting mess?  Who cares?  Exactly!).

We dropped our surfers at the Burger King, then found our way out 
of town trying to pick up highway 15 to Tepic.  We wanted to get 
to Puerto Vallarta that night to meet Christa's sister, so we 
didn't care to hang around one resort town when we had to get to 
another.

We filled up with gas at the south end of town, got ice, and hit 
the road.  The jungle heat was intoxicating.  We cruised along at 
a good clip for the first few hours over generally flat terrain.  
After a few hours, traffic in front of us simply stopped.  A huge 
line of cars extended out of sight up the road ahead of us, and 
many people were walking around their cars chatting.  No traffic 
was coming the other way.  It was very hot, so we took advantage 
of our westy.  We opened all the doors to get some breeze through 
the car, and made lunch.  Yum!  About an hour later, traffic 
started moving again, only to stop a few minutes later.  After 
another 10 minute wait, we were off again.  We never figured out 
what the problem was.  No skin off our noses though!  We had to 
eat lunch anyway!

Speaking of lunch, that reminds me of another thing about Mexican 
mainland driving: Road kills are everywhere.  Dogs, mules, cattle, 
horses.  You name it, it gets hit.  The interesting thing is 
nothing is done about them--they're just left where they fall.  
Remember, it's very humid and about 90 degrees F or more all day, 
so dead things bloat, rot, and putrify very quickly.  The stench 
can be overpowering.  Sometimes I would smell a road kill before I 
saw it.  Road kill can also be a real driving hazard: at one point 
a large semi-truck failed to avoid a very dead donkey and chipped 
up big chunks of the carcass; I was following close behind trying 
to pass and nearly hit it myself.  (Anybody remember the mid-80s 
hit song by Terminal Sunglasses, &quot;My cat was run over by a bus?&quot;  
Should I dig out the record and put a copy of the lyrics in the 
FAQ?  Sample:

My cat was fat,
Now he's flat--
  Flat as a mat!
Run over by a,
  Run over by a bus!) 

I think that the folks who built the main highways in Mexico 
either tried to save money on preparing the road bed, or the 
weight of the traffic has turned out to be more than anticipated, 
because the roads will develop this gentle wave to them every now 
and then.  This can generate an hilarious effect when driving 
into a wavy section at speed: we would start gently rolling up 
and down, then the amplitude of the wave would steadily increase 
until we were getting nearly full suspension travel.  Things would 
start flying around in the van, so I'd decide to slow down.  Of 
course, all the other drivers who had driven the road had decided 
the same thing at the same point, so the wave shortened up _and_ 
increased further in amplitude.  By this time, we were crashing 
into the back side of the next wave, and nearly getting air off 
the crests, with us being held down in our seats by our seatbelts.  
Wheee!  Sometimes I'd nearly have to pull off the highway I was 
laughing so hard.

Another thing about the mainland is that the population density is 
much higher on the mainland than the Baja.  Correspondingly, the 
traffic is quite a bit heavier, and the drivers more aggressive.  
The roads are not any wider, and pavement conditions are generally 
worse.  (Actually, I didn't really find the pavement on the main 
highways of Baja very bad at all, as long as I paid attention!) 

The road started to climb up to Tepic, and our speed dropped down 
to 35 mph on the climb.  We could have gone faster, but I didn't 
want the engine to get any hotter than necessary.  Spectacular 
country, with steep-sided rock formations rising out of the high 
mountain valleys, and everything was covered with a tangle of 
jungle.  In the valley bottoms we passed fields of bananas, 
pineapple, and other tropical fruits.  In places, the scent of 
sun-heated fruit would waft up to the road.  This was great!

At Tepic, we turned off onto Highway 200, the Pan-American 
Highway.  We'd be following highway 200 for the next couple of 
thousand miles as we wound our way down the Pacific coast to 
within a day's drive of Guatemala.  Once we left Tepic, the road 
began to drop precipitously, and continued to drop until we neared 
the Pacific almost 60 miles later.  The vegetation changed with 
our elevation, and we passed from a strange mix of oak and palm, 
through jungle with tangled vines overhead, to the coastal jungle.  
On the coastal plain, the villages along the highway were lined 
with vendors selling every kind of tropical fruit imaginable.  We 
stopped and got a pineapple, then bought some pastries from a gang 
of little kids who accosted us as we prepared to leave.  The 
pastries (yummy!) held us over until we arrived in Puerto Vallarta 
at dusk. 

We found the hotel where Christa's sister and brother-in-law were 
staying, and parked the camper for a few days as we enjoyed the 
resort life.  We took them on a day trip drive up to an empty 
beach north of town (just south of Punta de Mita), and enjoyed 
playing in the surf and getting sunburnt.  They were both very 
jealous of us, and wished they had as much time to explore as we 
did.  Soon, their time was up, and we drove them to the airport.  
We turned south once again.

We spent most of the day taking our time driving, arriving that 
night in the twin towns of Melaque / San Patricio.  Carl Franz's 
RV book had suggested a free camp site here, and we found it right 
away.  It was just a gravel lot with lots of RVs, but we were able 
to fit our little camper right up on the beach front.  Gotta love 
driving a VW bus!  This wasn't the most attractive site, but we 
liked the surrounding town and spent a couple of days here 
exploring and eating avocados, gazpacho, tortillas and drinking 
margaritas and beer.  We pulled in Radio Canada International over 
the shortwave and marvelled at how far away all those concerns 
seemed.

One of the people camping there, a guy driving a big Dodge pick-up 
with a big fifth wheel trailer, showed us the bullet hole he had 
picked up driving in Mazatlan a few days earlier.  Apparently the 
local police were a bit over-zealous trying to stop a robber, and 
sprayed the street with automatic weapon fire.  The fellow with 
the fifth wheel had a hole about 1 1/2&quot; in diameter in his front 
fender to show for it.  He seemed pretty unconcerned about the 
whole thing.

Before long, we were overcome with our desire to discover what lay 
ahead.  We filled up with gas and again turned south.  With every 
day driving farther south, it had gotten hotter.  And hotter.  It 
was getting extremely hot as we passed the industry around 
Manzanillo.  We had some fun in the small town of Armeria trying 
to explain ourselves as we bought mosquito screen material and the 
cord to hold it in place.  At Tecoman, we filled up our tank and 
the jerry can to overflowing for the next stage along the desolate 
section of Michoacan coast.  Soon we were grinding along the 
incredibly sinuous highway, clinging to the sides of the mountains 
as the Pacific crashed below us.  Like most Mexican highways, 
there were no guard rails.  This road was so twisty we spent the 
rest of the day in second gear, squealing through curve after 
curve.  

Let me say something about the coast road here: it is a very slow 
route.  Mexico is generally a pretty mountainous country, so most 
of the roads follow river valleys whenever possible.  This is, by 
and large, not possible on the coast road.  Along much of the 
Pacific side of Mexico, the Mountains drop straight into the sea.  
When a river meets the road, the highway has to descend steeply 
down to it, cross the river, then grind up the other side.  
Usually the road winds along the sides of the hills, high above 
the rocky shore, with no guard rails to keep a skidding car from 
plunging into the Pacific.  Inland sections of the highway can be 
fast, flat, and straight, but more often wind along climbing 
through jungle.  There are also long stretches without any fuel 
available, so passing a gas station with less than a full tank can 
be asking for trouble.  Even if you know there is a gas station a 
few hours up the road, that doesn't mean the they will actually 
have any gas to sell you.  The road is absolutely stunning to 
drive, and I highly recommend this route for anyone with the time 
to slow down and enjoy it.

There are a lot of bridges on this section of road, and Mexican 
bridges can take their toll on the suspension of your bus.  The 
problem is that roads are paved with asphalt and little bedding, 
and the bridge decks are usually concrete.  The roadway and bridge 
deck may have met years ago when the bridge was built, but now the 
road may had subsided as much as 4 or 5 inches below the bridge 
deck.  This results in an absolutely square abrupt bump at the 
beginning of most bridges on the coast road, and we hit them with 
a bone-crunching WHACK!  We actually had the driver's side upper 
suspension bushing (the rubber cone-shaped piece which limits the 
upward suspension travel) knocked completely off.  As a 
consequence, I had to take extra-special care positioning the bus 
on rough road for the remainder of the trip.  

After a few hours of constant hard cornering, Christa began to 
feel a little car sick from the rolling car in the intense heat.  
I offered to stop for a few minutes.  Around the next corner this 
THING crawled across the road in front of us.  It was black, about 
the size of a large dinner plate, was furry, and.... it had eight 
legs!  No!  Christa and I looked at each other in disbelief.  My 
God!  That was a spider, wasn't it?  Christa thought maybe she 
didn't have to stop after all and that we should just keep on 
driving.  Ok.  Twenty minutes later, ANOTHER one crawls across the 
road in front of us.  This was too much.  I threw the car off the 
road into some bushes, and grabbed the camera and Christa's shoe 
for scale.  I chased the spider across the road, trying to get a 
picture of it.  Oops, I forgot to put on shoes--I was barefoot.  
Oh well.  I threw down the shoe next to it.  It froze, and I bent 
over it looking through the viewfinder.  It jumped about 6 inches 
to one side and I freaked out.  I quickly bent over it again and 
snapped a picture. I stepped back, and it took off.  I grabbed 
Christa's shoe again, and headed back to the car.  Now THAT was a 
bug!

That night we pulled into an RV park behind a hotel in Playa Azul.  
We had a shower, swam in the pool, and made friends with the 4 
inch cockroaches in the bathroom.  Thank the gods for the porta-
potti!  

The next morning we met an older couple from Vancouver Island who 
were looking for someone for join them free camping on the beach 
south of town.  Since we were always quick to avoid paying for 
camping if we didn't have to, we joined them.  We spent a nice day 
and night parked on hard sand between a lagoon and the surf.  We 
joined them in their trailer for drinks and chatted until it got 
late.  We piled into bed and fell asleep to the sound of the surf 
crashing all along the beach.

We made it almost to Acapulco the next day, stopping just north of 
town at a place recommended in Carl Franz's RV book in Playa Pie 
de la Cuesta.  We spent the early evening sitting in hammocks on 
the beach sipping beer and watching the surf.  We spent the next 
morning snarled in traffic in Acapulco, trying to work our way 
through a city where it seemed every single road was under 
construction.  I was really getting to like driving in heavy 
Mexican city traffic: it was like bicycle racing, where everybody 
rides in a tight pack, fighting for position before every bend and 
curve.  Way cool!  We finally were able to pick up highway 200 
again, and headed south to Puerto Escondido.  

We arrived at Puerto Escondido that evening, and settled into an 
RV park recommended from Franz's book.  We were tempted to free 
camp, but word had it (and this included Franz's book) that there 
was a real thievery and mugging problem for tourists here.  So we 
opted for the security of a very nice site overlooking the Pacific 
for 60 pesos ($10 US, ouch!) a night.  Expensive, but very nice.  
There was a trail down to a small secluded sandy bay at the bottom 
of the cliff.  We rented a couple of hammocks down there, drank 
our beer, ate our munchies, and I even rented a boogie board!  I 
had fun in the surf while Christa read in her hammock.  We rented 
a snorkel and flippers and looked at pretty fish.  

The only real downer about this site was that a large American RV 
caravan had pulled in a day or two before.  There were about 15 
large rigs pulled up in a row, and the smallest of them was 
something like 35 feet long.  Most of them were built on what 
looked like a greyhound bus frame.  All of them were gleaming and 
nearly brand new.  They reeked of money.  I hated them on sight.  
Oh, sure, we tried to strike up conversations with them, smiled at 
them, etcetera, but they just looked through us and turned back to 
their golf-shirt-wearing pals.  They complained about the 
unreliable hook-up power, the dirty washrooms, and the bugs.  They 
didn't trust the local food, so they made burgers on gas barbeques 
they had brought along.  They watched satellite TV at night.  I 
didn't understand why they didn't just stay in Peoria--they 
weren't seeing Mexico at all.  They just looked blankly at it 
during commercials.

They washed their &quot;units&quot; frequently.  (Shut up, Steve!  :) )  One 
guy had a 12 inch hole in his windshield, so I casually walked by 
and asked him what had happened.  &quot;Some kids dropped a big rock on 
me from an overpass,&quot; he told me.  &quot;Oh,&quot; said.  &quot;And I've had lots 
of damn kids taking shots at me with sling shots, too,&quot; he 
continued, &quot;A lot of us have.&quot;  I looked from the barrio on the 
other side of the field and back to the gleaming row of $300,000 
machines beside me, &quot;Hmmmm,&quot; I said noncommittally.  Then he 
started spewing about how the Mexicans don't know a thing about 
how to run a country, never seen anything like it, the roads are a 
mess, the kids are never in school so they'll are just stay 
ignorant, and just last week he got a voltage spike through his 
power hook-up that took out his microwave, his VCR, _and_ his air 
conditioning!  &quot;What the hell am I supposed to do now?&quot; he whined.  
I suggested he ask the locals how they dealt with problems like 
that.  He didn't get it.  Where's Darwin when you need him?

One night at about 10:00, just as we're drifting of to sleep, we 
hear this racket coming from the caravaners.  Sounds like a TV 
turned up really loud.  Christa volunteers to go over there and 
ask them to turn down the damn TV and boot some heads.  Five 
minutes she returns, in utter disbelief.  I sit her down, trying 
to get her to calm down.  &quot;They're watching a movie!&quot; she tells 
me, &quot;All of them!&quot;  All of them?  Crowded into one big RV?  &quot;No, 
no,&quot; she says in disbelief, &quot;They're watching it _outside!_  
They've got a 10 foot projection TV and VCR hooked up outside, and 
they're all sitting on lawn chairs set up in neat little rows.&quot;  
My mind bends at the thought: this is like Norman Rockwell on 
acid.  &quot;What were they watching?&quot; I ask, thinking it might at 
least be a documentary on Mexico, some background on Mexican 
culture, whatever.  &quot;They're watching a John Candy movie&quot;, Christa 
says, he eyes glazing over, &quot;Might be Cool Runnings, that bob sled 
movie, whatever it's called.&quot;  

And, no, they didn't turn it down, and they didn't invite anyone 
else at the camp site to join them either.  I resolved to find a 
big rock the next morning, and wait at the next overpass.

I did manage to get so essential stuff done on the bus in Puerto 
Escondido, though.  I took some time to wire up a switch for our 
gas heater up to the dashboard.  It want hard to imagine it now, 
but I knew we'd need it when we got to the Canadian maritimes in 
early March.  While I was under the car I noticed one of our CV 
joint boots had been cut wide open.  Uh oh.  I sealed the joint up 
with duct tape and drove into town where I bought a replacement 
boot for 40 pesos (about $7 US).  Back at the site, I jacked up 
the van, pulled off the driveshaft, and disassembled the joint.  I 
expected the worst.  Lucky me: the joint was fine.  I reassembled 
the joint, greased everything happily, and had the car off the 
jack by dinner time.  Now we had a working heater switch and happy 
CVs.  

After a few relaxing days in Puerto Escondido, we decided to move 
on.  The constant heat had begun to wear us down, so instead of 
going to Tapachula at the Guatemalan border (which was something 
we'd sort of had in mind when we started), we turned north at 
Puerto Angel and headed up highway 175 towards Oaxaca (pronounced 
Wah-HAH-kah).  The road quickly became the twistiest, steepest, 
and highest we had yet encountered.  The road followed valleys, 
climbed mountain faces, followed mountain ridges, then dropped off 
the other side.  On some sections of road along these ridges the 
mountain dropped away thousands of feet on _both_ sides of us.  
I'd never experienced vertigo while driving before.  The road 
climbed up so high we felt short of breath when walking around, 
and the jungle had disappeared.  Oaks and scrub surrounded us, 
with the jungle canopy visible in the valley bottoms far below.  
After a long, hair-raising descent we reached the valley floor 
near Oaxaca.  Sometimes long sections of descent were so steep 
that we couldn't hold our speed with engine compression in _first_ 
gear!  I was stupid and took it down a few descents too fast, 
over-heating the brakes--and I hardly ever use the brakes in 
normal driving, and tried my best (aside from simply slowing down 
to a 'sane' speed of 10 - 15 mph) to keep the brakes cool on this 
run.  The rear wheels had gotten so hot that I had blown bearing 
grease right out the ends of the hub, as I discovered days later 
when the grease began to creep outwards on the wheel past the hub 
cap.  I should have re-packed the rear wheel bearings once I 
realized what had happened (but I didn't), so I needed to replace 
the bearings on both wheels when we got home to Vancouver 9,000 
miles later.

We pulled into Oaxaca in the early evening, and settled into 
another RV park recommended by Carl Franz.   We spent a few days 
exploring the city.  Christa had to try some of the chocolate this 
part of Mexico is famous for, and we drank some at a little stall 
in one of the markets.  We found a little outdoor square next to 
the Basilica de la Soledad that was full of people selling home-
made ice cream in really wild flavours: carmelized goat's milk, 
burned milk, walnut, and of course, coconut.  We ate four bowls of 
ice cream, lamenting we didn't have the appetite to try the other 
20 or so flavours.  I guess we'll have to come back.  

I took advantage of the cooler, less-humid mountain weather to do 
some work on the camper.  I wired up and installed a dip-stick oil 
temperature gauge, and did a valve adjustment, tune-up, and oil 
change.  I couldn't bear to dump the old oil (and I didn't think 
Oaxaca had an oil recycling program), so we ended up packing our 
used oil out of the country. 

We took one day to explore the area surrounding Oaxaca.  We headed 
south out of town, and stopped to explore the ruins at Yagul.  We 
arrived just as a school field trip was leaving, and we were often 
the only people at the site for the two hours we were there.  We'd 
heard stories of the crowding and commercialization at Mitla, 
another nearby site, and we loved being able to explore having 
only the lizards for company.  

The official tourist map of the area showed an unpaved road 
connecting the valley near the ruins to a town we wanted to visit 
in another part of the valley.  On the map, the road appeared to 
be about 50 km long.  We found the dirt road, and bounced off into 
the hills.  About 20 km later, we ground up a steep grade on a 
very rough cobbled road into a small village.  We needed ice, and 
it seemed all activity in the town stopped as we got out of the 
camper.  The town store had no ice, but a small boy had heard my 
stumbling conversation with the person behind the counter, and he 
lead me to his mother's house, where a big party was underway.  
She gave me two baggies of ice she'd frozen in her freezer, and 
seemed surprised when I asked her how much she'd like for them.  
She seemed to mentally scramble for a figure, then asked for a 
peso, but I gave her two since I didn't have a one peso coin and 
she was so hospitable.  

We got back to the camper and started to drive off.   I didn't 
know which road to take out of the village, and the road I was on 
was blocked by construction.  I asked some older women which road 
would get me where I needed to go, and one woman gave me rapid-
fire directions.  The blank look on my face must have impressed 
her, because she simply said, &quot;follow me&quot; (in spanish), and began 
to walk through town, occasionally turning and motioning us to 
continue following her.  She led a labyrinthine path through the 
narrow streets, finally stopping and pointing down an open road.  
We thanked her profusely, and we drove out of town waving and 
smiling.  Most of the town folk were still watching the crazy 
Canadians disappear in a cloud of dust.

The road twisted and crawled over low mountains, and we often 
found ourselves driving on roads consisting of two tire tracks 
across the desert, or straddling deep wash outs.  Several hours 
later, we came across another village.  We stopped to admire the 
town's church (which was very large for such a small town), and a 
group of men came over to see the gringos in the dusty &quot;kombi&quot;.  
We said hello, and I asked them if we were on the right road.  
&quot;Si, si!,&quot; they assured us.  I broke out our map, and explained to 
them where we'd come from and where we needed to go.  They 
reassured us, and one of the men listed all the names of the towns 
we would pass through.  We thanked them and headed off again.  
Hours later, we reached our destination and the highway 
exhilarated, tired, hot, and very dusty.  Later that evening we 
pulled into a different RV park in Oaxaca, and I shook out our air 
filter and cleaned the worst of the dust from the engine 
compartment.

The next day we returned to the RV park we first stayed at to find 
someone's RV had been fire-bombed the night before.  I'm pretty 
sure it was a rich/poor thing, especially since the RV that was 
hit was a very shiny, rather large unit.  We were running out of 
time for our insurance in Mexico anyway, so after discussing 
possible routes back to the states that evening, we decided we'd 
head through the next mountain range towards Veracruz and the Gulf 
of Mexico the next morning.

Next week: Cruising the flatlands along the Gulf to Texas.  Heat!  
Humidity!  Flat driving!  Drug search!  Toll bridges!  Federales!  
Flatland!  (Did I mention it was flat?)
