Subject: F.S. '84 GL A/C 4spd white $2500 o.b.o.

There's a fellow near me selling a '84 7 pass GL, A/C, 4spd, white paint w/ tan
velour interior, 150k mi. , new hd. gasket,  very good cond. in and out .  he's
asking    $2500 o.b.o.  and he's in Allentown, Pa.  his # is (610) 852-2268

I've not seen the van yet, but talked to the guy on the phone,as a friend of
mine gave me his number.  it is real close, and I could go take a look if your'e
interested.
