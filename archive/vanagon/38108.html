Sound's like the Winnebago conversion.

I stopped by a VW dealer today and asked about a '96 EV, he said, &quot;nope&quot;, 
but they're suppose to get some for the '97 model year.  Then again this 
is coming from somebody who thinks the EuroVan is made by Winnebago.

&gt; Westy.  This EV had a two-paned louvered (?) window on the drivers side and
&gt; no other windows behind the cab.  Could this be a full blown Eurovan
&gt; Westfalia?  I thought they weren't selling those over here in the US...
