Bill , have you ever driven a Eurovan?

I have.  God, I HATED it!  That 5-cylinder engine right up front there 
really growls in your ears so loudly it's hard to have a conversation.  The 
one I drove, a Winnebago conversion, didn't feel any quicker, any more 
responsive or any nimbler than my '86 Westie.  But it sure was LOUD!

I'm VERY disappointed.  My Westie is getting (how shall I say?) a bit long 
in the tooth now.  I like a QUIET car, and the Vanagon is one.  The Eurovan 
is decidedly not.
