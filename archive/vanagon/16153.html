Subject: Re: Help on Brake Drum.


&gt;I can't get the brake drum off for the life of me.
&gt;
&gt;Is there some sort of tool which lets you hook it to the drum, and 
&gt;somehow put pressure in the middle on the axle to get it to come 
&gt;loose?
&gt;

This is a common problem for buses that have sat around for a while
and I have used the following proceedure:

#1  Adjust the brake shoe adjusting screw stars in all the way.

#2  Tap around the entire drum with hammer to loosen up the shoes if
    they were stuck to the drum.

#3  If the drum still won't come off, the shoes may be pivoting.  You 
    might have to use a screwdriver to tap the shoes through the lug
    bolt holes in the drum.  Putting the wheel back on the drum can
    give you more leverage for pulling the drum off.

#4  If all else fails go and get a wheel puller that does exactly as
    you described above.  Mine has 3 arms that bolt onto the drum in
    the lug bolt holes.  Snap On has one in their currrent catalog.
