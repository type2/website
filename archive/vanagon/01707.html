Subject: Re: Vanagon choking when feeding gas

&gt; 
&gt; I have tolerated the problem for 10 years. I have had enough. I got another
&gt; vanagon (a 83 Westfalia) recently from a friend who went overseas for a job
&gt; which forced him to give up this camper. Then I noticed this 83 sibling does
&gt; not have this problem at all. I found out that the tube that goes from gas cap
&gt; to gas tank has different sizes.

Oddly enough, had you been brave and gone to your dealer, this problem 
would have been solved under warranty! 

It's possible that the small vent tubes (to the charcoal canister) in the 
filler pipe were/are plugged. 

&gt; 
&gt; Obviously the one on my 84 is smaller than the one on the camper. The camper
&gt; has a bigger one and it never chokes.

Depending in where you live, this '83 camper nay actually have an illegal
filler tube... My '85 WestfaliaGL was delivered at Wiedenbrueck without 
the fuelvapor trapping and non-leaded only restrictor plate. This was 
replaced with the US spec fuel filler pipe when it was shipped to California
from Bremerhaven...

&gt; 
&gt; My question is if anyone got this problem on 84 vanagons? Can this tube be
&gt; replaced with a bigger one like the one on the 83 camper? Any feedback on this
&gt; is very much appreciated.

It may be illegal...I've still got mine, should anyone want it.
