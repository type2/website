Subject: Found me an engine (82 Westy diesel repower)
Date: Wed, 29 May 1996 14:58:36 -0400

     Well, looks like I am going for gas!

     Last week, I was wondering about repowering my blown diesel Westy with
     a turbo-diesel from a 1980's Jetta. I found an engine, complete for
     $700. Looks interesting....

     Last night, I went out and looked at a wrecked, blown tranny 1986 Golf
     with approx 100k on it. Engine burns just a bit of oil, but has
     excellent compression on all four cylinders. Also has functioning A/C!
     Made a dreal to buy the whole car for $350. I will have it towed to my
     house in a few weeks.

     The engine is the 1.8l, with knock-sensor ignition. Looks like the
     most fun will be getting the exhaust set up. I hope not to use the
     stock diesel exhaust manifold.

     I'll keep the list posted on my progress. I'm starting to get my web
     page together, right now I just have a mirror of the stuff that Dave
     Schwartze has kept for me about the VW's in the school library. That
     stuff can be found at http://www.relitech_dot_com/tomc/prank.htm.

     (Dave, if you need the drive space, feel free to remove the pictures
     from your site...and maybe just a link? Thanks for the storage!!!)

     Take care!
