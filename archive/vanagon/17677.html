Subject: How much for a '87 GL
Date: Tue, 16 May 95 16:46:43 EDT

Well I might have found another candidate for a new van for my
dad and want some ideas about reasonable price.  The story is
this '87 has been the personal run around, vacation car for the
owner of the local dealership, he got it about 2 years ago and I
wanted to buy it myself back then as he meant to sell it then decided
to keep it for vacationing.  He got it at about 62,000 and performed
the secret head warranty he did on ours, pulling, surfacing,
glassbeading, etc.  It now has only 64,700 ridiculously low for a
'87.  This is a GL but has the &quot;Wolfsburg Edition?&quot; package entitling
one to ground effects (first year? not as complete as later Vanagon
rubber effects), flip around center seats and table inside, basically
a MV with no pop top.  It's a beautiful silver metalic, no rust though
rear bumper cover is badly cracked and 2 major small dings, normal door
dings etc.  It also has a VW roof rack, A/C, 4 spd, normal Vanagon
stuff for the GL, power mirrors and rear wiper but not windows or
door locks.  Now he had his dealership taking pretty incredible care
of the beast but recently got a EV MV that he hasn't sold so he's been
using it for vacation and running around instead and I figure it's time
to ask about the Vanagon which has been sitting idle behind the lot
in a lockup for a month or two.  Back when I inquired before he wanted
$7500 I think but it has been 1.5 to 2 years ago.  I have no real
bargaining ploys since the heads were done, tires are pretty worn
Yoko 356's though which confuses me as I would have figured the origional
Michelins good for 50,000 so why the next set would be gone in 15,000
is a little confusing.  Anyway I consulted Edmund's on the WWW and the
price looked to be about $6k with the mileage bonus, does this sound
reasonable (that was the retail listing) should I shoot for much less or
would that be about right, shame its not a syncro though (sigh).
On that note the thing about it is, he has a beutiful though 112,000
mile '87 Quantum syncro, the ideal succesor to my old '86 which I gave
up at 150,000 because I accidently bought it about 1 qt low on gear oil
(oops live and learn to check everything I guess, especially on a syncro) so
I have in mind to see if he'll trade me the Quantum and the Vanagon for
my Corrado, about an even trade by the NADA book, at which point I can
sell the van to dad for $5k or so and use the rest to keep up the
Quantum, which I sorely miss.

'71 Westy, '90 Corrado G60 (yes I'd rather have a 4wd wagon, thats how
                            good a Quantum syncro is)
