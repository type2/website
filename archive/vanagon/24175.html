Subject: `74 Adventurewagen/dual carbs wanted

Been spending some quality time with my `74, and learned quite a few
things...

#1 The fuel injection system on there is _not_ stock
(It faked me out for awhile, but after I started pulling things apart,
the gaping holes they cut into the firewalls (!) to get everything to fit
(using a smoke wrench) gave them away.)
#2 The wiring need far more work than anticipated, due to #1.
The DPO apparently had little or no idea of how a fuel-injected system
works (even less than I do :) and decided it would be a Good Idea to
rip apart all the wiring. I still haven't figured out where everything
goes.
#3 Sex is nearly impossible on the top bed of an Adventurewagen. (The
bed is on the roof, and slides out.)
#4 I've decided to refit the dual carb setup to this bus, but I, uh,
lack any dual carbs/manifolds for this. (I originally was going to
try to get the EFI system to work, but it's too much of an unknown
at this point.)
