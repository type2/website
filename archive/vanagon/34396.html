Subject: '78 Westy SHOULD I BUY IT?????

from: a Newbie
I have been carrying this in my pocket for 3 days and dreaming

Ad as follows:VW WESTFALIA '78: 2000cc, propane stove, pop-top, sleeps 4,
sink, new tires, new battery, new brakes,runs great, pullout am/fm cass.
excl cond., $3900.

I have been lurking on the list for a few days. My teenager totalled my
1987 toyota van I had for 9 years and me and the kids are currently riding
the bus. I could handle all the basic repairs and maintenance on my old
van.
But as a recent single parent now w/kids will this be a good investment or
I guess what I really need vs. want is a car big enough for 5 people and a
VW van for the beach and weekends.
With a factory manual would I be able to take care of repairs without too
much expense. My brother is a german car specialist, lives 3 hrs away but
at least parts are available at a discount.
Yes, I asked him but he says it is my van; my decision

Depending on mileage what is a fair counter offer range for a '78?
Patty
