Subject: 76 westy seal ???

Hello all.

I just got my West Coast Metric Catalogue, which I was dutifully perusing,
when I noticed it lists a seal for Westys which goes on the drivers-side
rear panel, where that body piece is that they put in to look like the
place where the middle sliding door track goes on the passangers side (I'm
having trouble describing just what, I hope you get the idea).  The piece
is part &quot;N&quot; on page 121 of catalogue 15, part #211-800 &quot;beading, side door
raling cover&quot;.  What is this, anyone know?

Thanks,
Eric,
Maggie

BTW, I discovered this last weekend, that it's not a good idea to tow a bus
with just a tow dolly, when you have to load the rear end on the dolly (
like I did with my automatic).  Just thought I'd pass this along...
