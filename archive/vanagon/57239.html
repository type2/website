Subject: rear lights '81

I just got around to fixing the rear light assemblies on my '81 Westie.
First of all, the tabs on one side of the passenger side light that hold
the two halves together are broken.  Has anybody figured out an alternate
way of holding it together?  The light is perfect otherwise.

Second, in the middle, below the backup light, is a place where another
light could have gone, but it appears the factory left it out.  As a
result, that part of the assembly never lights.  What's that for?

Third, since the brake lights and turn signals are separate, I will need
some kind of adaptor to hook up my little boat trailer lights, since the
brake and turn signal are the same filament on the trailer.  Has anybody
made one?  Seems like diodes could work.  If not, where can I get one?

Thanks,


Bill
