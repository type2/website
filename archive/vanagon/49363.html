&gt; Tell you what, Eric.  I've only been dicking around with you on this lens

&gt; stick the lens UP your ass as far as it will go and twist, because 
&gt; I'd pay you to do THAT way in advance of buying it from you outright.

&gt; I only had to put up with your two week delays getting back to me and 
&gt; your wierd, fucked up typing methods for months, and this is how you 
&gt; treat me?  Used to be that people like you were kept off the net because 
&gt; you weren't smart enough to find a job that would let you have net 
&gt; access.  Too bad the great unwashed and impolite have managed to find 
&gt; a place in what used to be a cool and clean place.
