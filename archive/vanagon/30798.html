Subject: RE: DASHBOARD ALTARS



&gt; &gt; I also have a portrait of Pee-Wee Herman filling the unused third
&gt; &gt; instrument hole in my dashboard.  Helps me keep my perspective....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In that portrait of yours, I don't even want to know what Pee-Wee is
&gt; using to fill the hole in your dashboard.  That's sick.  ;-)
&gt; P.S. - What kind of perspective does that help keep?
&gt; 

Hmmm... perspective... I guess why I felt good 'ol Smiling Pee Wee Herman 
was a spiritual icon worthy of dashboard prominance was because of his 
out-of-the-ordinary, borderline insane, anachronistic
kids TV show, Pee Wee's Playhouse...nothing but pure sugar-buzz insanity.

When I'm putting up a hill at 35mph, Mr. Herman's smiling mug reminds me 
why I love my bus, Patience.  It's out-of-the ordinary, anachronistic, 
and nothing but pure carbon monoxide-buzz insanity (must replace those 
heater boxes soon).   I drive her because it's fun fun fun.

And he goes well with the sock monkey (also a throwback to simpler days).

p.s.)  both monkeys and pee wee are infamous for public displays of 
       self-gratification.  hee hee!
