Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

Just a suggestion, but I plan on subscribing to the aircooled list and
reading &quot;interesting&quot; messages now and then on Skip's list archive (assuming
he continues to provide us with this handy service :) ).  That way I
automatically get the messages of most interest to me, but still have the
ability to keep up with the &quot;other half&quot;.
