Subject: Recall Campaign PB

Dear Volkswagen Owner:

This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

Volkswagen has determined that a defect which relates to motor vehicle
safety exists in 1986 and some early production 1987 model Volkswagen
Vanagon, Camper and Syncro vehicles.  Our records show that you are the
owner of one of these vehicles.

We have determined that if these vehicles are operated with fuel of a
higher &quot;Reid&quot; pressure, fuel vapors could form during hot weather and
become trapped in the fuel filter located inside the fuel tank
(Volkswagen Vanagon and Camper vehicles only).  If this occurs, the fuel
flow to the engine could be restricted and the vehicle could stall.  We
have also found that the usage of high &quot;Reid&quot; pressure fuel could, under
high engine load adn high ambient temperatures, lead to engine stalling
since the main and idle control units are programmed on the basis of
fuel with lower vapor pressure (Vanagons, Campers, including Syncros).
Both conditions present a safety risk, especially in heavy traffic, and
could result in an accident or cause injury.

We urge you to arrange an appointment with your authorized Volkswagen
dealer as soon as possible.  Your dealer will install a new fuel tank
containing a redesigned fuel filter and replace the control unit with a
modified unit IF APPLICABLE.  We estimate that it will take approximately
3 hours to complete the work.  All work will, of course, be free of
charge.  Parts will be available at your dealer on or about May 11, 1987.

If your dealer fails or is unable to remedy the defect free of charge
within a reasonable time, you may call or write the nearest Customer
Assistance office listed in the enclosure.  If you still cannot obtain
satisfaction, please call or write to:
