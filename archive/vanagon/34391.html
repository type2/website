Sami,

What I got out of Charlie Brown's response was that he sold you a used part,
like any other junkyard, and charged you a $20 core charge... which is
probably what the part cost him to begin with.  Mark up a nice profit for
Charlie Brown and the gang.  And a subtle message to his customers:  If you
want it, you gotta pay me.
