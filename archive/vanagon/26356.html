&gt; 73 busses did come with dual carbs, but it's such a tricky system to keep
&gt; going that a lot of people put in a single carb system. It's an aftermarket
&gt; kit. I hear it s better. 

It may be better, or it may not.  If you live in California, it is not,
due to the ridiculous smog regulations that fail you for any non-stock
carb, no matter how clean it runs.  I have the stock dual carbs, and am
generally pleased with them.  I have rebuilt/adjusted them myself, and
they run great - plenty of power, efficient, and reliable.  Why bother
with aftermarket single carb setups?  If you read about the dual carbs
and understand how they work, they can be great.  Too bad that word of
mouth has given them such a bad reputation.  Please folks, give them a
chance!
