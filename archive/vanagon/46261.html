&gt; 
&gt;&gt;this work--I seem to recall a company named Rimco in California, but do they
&gt;&gt;do mail order? I'm perfectly content to take my chances with an align bore
&gt;&gt;from a good shop and I'm not interested in paying $330-$400 for a new case.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; Greetings:
&gt; 
&gt;    I have been using Rimco's services for years and have been always
&gt;satisfied. They have no problem with UPS at all. They are one of the oldest
&gt;VW machine shops around and have a very good reputation. If you need their
&gt;address let me know. I beleive they advertise in Hot VWs.
