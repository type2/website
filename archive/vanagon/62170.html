Subject:  the stupidest question yet!

This may be the dumbest question yet(if it is I should win a new vr6 or
at least one of those 5th seats with the strong box underneath), but
what purpose are the white knobs just above and behind the driver and
passenger seats for in my 84 westy? They are not needed to hang the
curtains and seem to have little to do with the fuel infection system.
