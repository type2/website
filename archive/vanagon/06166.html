Subject: Re: Kamm tail + mpg


&gt;i'm not sure, but i think that kham was/is from pakistan or india. i'm 
&gt;not sure maybe somebody else remembers beter than i do.

I think he was german, Kamm, and the Kammtail represents a balance between 
surface area drag, ie skin friction, and flow turbulence drag at the rear 
end of the vehicle. 
    Essentially, a long gently tapered back end allows the air flowing 
over/under the car to merge together cleanly, without creating a turbulent 
suction zone, but the surface area of such a long back end increases skin 
drag countering the drag reduction gained. Kammtail is thus a workable 
compromise for overall drag reduction.
 Those whale tails are to create down force only, plus push some cooling air 
through to the P-motor and AC cooler. The air screaming over the top of an 
unadorned P-car is going faster than that passing under it, since it travels 
up and over the car. This generates nice lift at high speeds, like a good 
airplane wing should, hence the need for a whale tail, to push the back end 
into the pavement. Preventing air from getting under the car is also a great 
help in cutting this lift effect, hence the massive air dams seen on the 
front of P-cars. Whale tails are supposed to be used only with a front dam 
in place to avoid unwanted floating of the front end at high speeds. I have 
seen drag coefficients of 0.36 for fully fitted P-cars, not exactly low 
nowadays, but if you've got 400+ HP and the car corners like it's on rails, 
who cares.  tim s.
