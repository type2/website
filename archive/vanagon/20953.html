Subject: 71 gen. problem

none of my books seem to cover this and i am clueless I use the turn signal
and the generator light comes on full red one time it whent off while driving
most times it stays on.  The next day or after a long rest it will not come
on untill i use the signal again.  All other electrical works except the
raido may or may not be related its fuse (add on glass) blew and now with new
fuse will not work.  is something grounding or is it the blinker switch i
dont know any suggestions?
