&gt; --&gt;IMPORTANT NOTICE:  I STRONGLY urge that one person in the paired groups

&gt; This will insure positive space, and without it, you may be camping in the next 
&gt; county at this time of year, and on a weekend  :(  

Even with reservations there's no guarentee that we'll be grouped 
together.  I would like to reccommend/ask that all the people with mistix 
reservations give thier info to Martha.  That way we can have the people 
that get there first save spots that are closest to where we want to be.  
Since I don't have a reservation, and I'll be following Martha, I'll be 
able to save one next to her's.
