Subject: Re: [68-91] limited slip diff


&gt;&gt; [A locking rear] will get you about 90% of the potential
&gt;&gt;traction of the Syncro

&gt;        Is this the groups concensus?  If so I think that I will be doing
&gt;some heavy research into having one of these installed.  Any differing
&gt;opinions out there? Ratifications?

Tim Smith and I have been arguing about this in email (in a remarkably
erudite and urbane way). ;) He claims more like 66%, and the disputation
progresses from there. He also has some excellent VW/offroad stories to
tell. Hopefully we can draw him out in public. Tim?
