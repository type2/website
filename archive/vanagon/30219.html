Subject: RE: Owners Manuals


&gt;Looking for that owners manual that the PO forgot to put in the glove
&gt;box...didn't have one...lost yours?
&gt;
&gt;Just call VW-America at 1-800-544-8021, if its still available they will
&gt;gladly sent it to you.  I just got off the phone with them and have a 82
&gt;Vanagon owners manual on its way.  Cost me $10, but hey, its worth it.


Just successfully ordered one for an '80 Vanagon from them. Cost
was $10.00 plus $4.95 sipping, takes a week to ten days they said.

Thanks for the info!

Now, if it just has a section detailing the care and feeding of Chevy V6
engines...   :^)
