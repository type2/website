Shawn, 
Where are you located? I have never seen a auto like the one you are
referring to.  I am in the US.

&gt; Sorry, another sill sighting.
&gt; 
&gt; Leaving work late today, I saw a white (do they come any other way?)
&gt; EV dbl cab pickup. Nice, and it had four doors like a tri star. Only
&gt; thing that I didn't like were the cheesy rear fenders hanging under
&gt; the box - looked like they belonged on a boat trailer.
&gt; I much prefer the storage lockers in the Vanagon p/u style - maybe
&gt; these are an option in the EV p/u? (I don't recall noticing the
&gt; fenders before, and we do have several EV pickups in town)
