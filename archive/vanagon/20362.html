Jesse,
A couple of things come to mind.  Mind you, I have an 81 so I may not be 
able to hit the nail directly on the head, but I should come close.  
I second the idea of the faulty cold start switch, that's where I'd start 
looking anyway.  If the van came from sea level the timing could be waaay
off.  Have him check that as well.  If the problem still appears to be 
flooding, have her hold the pedal to the floor when she first cranks it 
over, that usually gets a flooded engine running again.

As far as the computer's sensor's go, I'm not real up on which direction 
the resistance takes as temps change.  I'm sure someone else here with a 
76 could clue you in.

Where exactly is the van?  I may have someone else for you to take it to 
if the first mech pans out.

Jack

PS -- I don't think the USENET idea is too hot.  Signal to noise ratio 
would go through the roof.  Better to just leave things the way they are 
and look for a cheap 9600.
