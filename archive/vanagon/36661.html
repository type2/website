Subject: Number of EVs sold in US


In the posting about the woes of the Euro-bago, the number of 200,000 EVs 
sold in the US was mentioned. From my research, there were approximately 
8,000 EVs sold in the US by VW prior to the advent of the EuroBago. I doubt 
very much that there are 192,000 EuroBagos floating around.

It is interesting to note that there have been close to 1,000,000 T4s built 
since their introduction in 1990....therfore less than 1% are here in the 
US.
