 &gt; With all this talk about Alloy wheels, I would like to ask one question -
 &gt; 
 &gt; Is there any problem with or adjustment needed when putting standard VW
 &gt; Westfalia Alloy wheels on a VW that came with steel wheels? 
 &gt; 


I just did this last weekend -- removed the alloys from the '87
Wolfsburg (which is in statis with a blown engine) and put them on the
'82 diesel Westy that I put back on the road -- not a single
problem....


BTW, the diesel westy is as loud as I remember it, but it is somehow
not as underpowered as I remember it.  I have no problems keeping up
with traffic around Pittsburgh -- I think I'll keep it on the road
and see if I can get a few camping trips out of it this summer...
