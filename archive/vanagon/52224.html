Subject: Eurovan Central Locking

Hello EV'ers:

My 1995 EV-Winne has developed the irritating habit
of cycling its power door locks locked/unlocked
continually when the weather is wet.  This occurs when 
trying to operate the lock.  Once inside with the door
closed, the cycling stops.  I have to time
a pull on the door handle in order to get in!  When
the weather is dry, everything is normal.  Sometimes
the problem can be overcome by using the lock on the 
other door, but the problem is not restricted to one lock.

Any similar experiences?  Any ideas?

Thanks

Dan Herbert
