Huh?  &quot;One foot on each side of the bar&quot;?  I know what you're are trying to
say, but I don't know what you mean by &quot;one foot on each side of the bar&quot;.  
This might be interpreted as one foot on the top side and one foot on the
bottom side - but you can't stand on the bottom side.  Also, if you had a
slide-handle that was centered at the socket, your words might be interpreted
as one foot on the left side and one foot on the right side - but this would
of course impart no torque.

Did you really mean to write &quot;...and stand with one foot on each side of the
bar, and equalize my wieght.&quot;??
