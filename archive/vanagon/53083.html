Subject: FS in NC: 91 Syncro Westy - w/ sunroof!

Sure wish I could buy this; maybe one of you can:

1991 Vanagon Syncro Westfalia
72k miles
a/c, cruise, sunroof $16,500
919-393-7890

I spoke to one of the owners briefly and yes, it does have both a/c and
a sunroof...

That's about all I know of it - I saw it advertised in today's Raleigh
_News &amp; Observer_. Oh yeah - the color is champagne w/ silver, or vice
versa. 
&gt;Oh well, it's just a material thing. I don't NEED it.
