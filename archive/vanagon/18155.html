Subject: Did I score? (Or lose my marbles?)

Well, after a few posts of stuff I *might* get, I thought I'd finally
post about some busses I *just* got. Both of these busses have been
sitting in a storage yard for about ten or so years, so I don't
know if they currently run (though the original owner told me they both
were started at the end of last winter (`93-`94 winter, that is.) So
who knows? Mabey they both work! The engines looked clean and well-
maintained, and had decent records.

1972 kombi: NO RUST (serious rust, anyway.) 135,000 miles. (?)might
have a rebuild in it, will get the paperwork tomorrow. complete,
straight, fairly nice, doesn't look like anything's been messed with.

1974 Adventurewagen: NO RUST! Complete working (?) camper interior!
(Very nice! No rips, ravels, breakage, etc.!) Straight, many colors,
(Looks like a professional shop replaced some panels on the side.(?)
Again questionable until I see the paperstuff. Someone thought it
would be a good idea to  take the air cleaner and related stuff off
and put it inside. (Why do people feel a need to do these things?)
Wires hanging out from under the dash, (ditto, especially if they have
no intention of putting them back in?)

It was a package deal for $400.00 US.

`62 beatle (For Ric.), `66 camper, `72 kombi, `74 Adventurewagen!
Entering the world of the bay-windows!
There. NOW I have far too many cars!
