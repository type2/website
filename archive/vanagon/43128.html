Subject: Bushings

While picking through my gasket set for the 81, I come across 4 white,
possibly nylon, split bushings in a sort of star shape. They remind me of the
10 man pieces from a &quot;Risk&quot; game. I didn't remove anything like that and I
haven't spotted them in the repair manuals.

Any ideas what these are for?
