Erik said&gt;

&gt;Why must I drive a front engined, front wheel drive, water
&gt;cooled Audi to work every day?

Become a slacker barney and you would not have to put up with it, 'cause 
you would not have to drive to work! :-)

Actually, Erik, it doesn't sound that bad to me, indeed, kind of 
familiar!
