Subject: Spring Cleaning

Yesterday I pushed up the roof of my '87 Westy for the first time this year.
Found signs of &quot;dreaded&quot; mold: nice little black dots, and some yellow ones
too.  My ceiling is a fuzzy surface (maybe they all are), so I'm not sure
what the best cleaning approach would be.  Any experience?  Any disasters?
