Subject: For Sale:  my '91 GL  :- (

1991 Vanagon GL, 4 spd, Tornado Red..........$7500.00

This Vanagon and my '86 before this have been two of the greatest joys of
my life. I know most of you know the feeling.  I am not at all mechanically
minded so I've decided it's time to pass along my '91 to someone who is
more capable of providing care in those later Vanagon years.  I know it's
ONLY a '91 but it's seen a good deal of road.  I'm moving on to a Golf Trek
(a Driver FOUND).

-Maintained with excellence (all records available)

-131,500 miles (50 highway miles a day to work and back, Western NY to
Upper Michigan twice a year, AND..........just returned from an 11,000 mile
journey, safely and flawlessly carrying my 20 y/o daughter (and friend)
from Buffalo to most everywhere out West, and back home).  Well almost
flawlessly, it seems it may need a new starter.

-heads were replaced at around 95,000 miles.
-Lifetime muffler
