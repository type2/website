Subject:      FFFriday Follies: Old King Bradley and his Prunecake ...

               Old King Bradley
       (from an old song about Old King Brady)
        ... a REAL old song ...

&lt;chorus&gt;
    Well ...
      Bradley, Bradley, Bradley, you know you done wrong,
      Well, bringin them prunes where dey don't belong,
      Well, knockin down de bushes, breaking down de trees,
      And now you lying dead out in de wildernees!
      Cause you eatin dem prunes tooo long!

Well, Bradley, Bradley was tending de far,
When along come Martha in her new 'lectric car,
Well, Martha says, &quot;Bradley, you in need of a rest,&quot;
Well, Bradley threw dem prunes right at Miz Martha's chest.
Cause he eatin dem prunes too long!

&lt;chorus&gt;

Well, Old King Bradley was a big fat man,
When de doctor come, took hold of his hand,
Well, he felt for a pulse, and den de doctor said,
&quot;I believe to my soul that old King Bradley's dead!
&quot;Cause he eatin dem prunes too long!&quot;

&lt;chorus&gt;

Well, the rest of de campers dragged old Bradley away,
Cause hiz body was a'blockin where dey wanted to play,
Where dey wanted to be settin, and a'drinkin all dat beer,
Well, dey drunker was a'gettin, but dey didn't shed a tear!
He's been eatin dem prunes doo long!

&lt;chorus&gt;

Well, the next thing dey knew, old King Bradley was back,
Saying, &quot;Dat doctor's crazy! I ain't dead yet! He's a quack!&quot;
So dey let him to de campfire where dey all set on de ground,
Burning engine cases in de far and passin beer around.
And he don't eat dem prunes no more!

&lt;chorus&gt;
