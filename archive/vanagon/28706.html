&gt;2. The extended length EV Camper (Riatta?) is not the only camper available
&gt;in Canada.

The Winnebago Rialta is wholly different from anything on a VW lot.  It is a
EV front end and chassis with a Winnebago mini-motorhome body from the
B-pillar on back.  This Rialta is sold at Winnebago dealers.

The EV camper is converted to a Westfalia-like pop-top by Winnebago and sold
through VW dealers.
