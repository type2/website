Thanks to all who answered my request for information - I'm impressed by
the enthusiasm.  You have to be in love to write as much as some of you
folks did.  But I'm a little puzzled by one response, to the effect that
the late 80's Eurovans had &quot;no more injector problems than others, and not
expensive to fix.&quot;  I was under the impression that they had all sorts of
odd problems - that in fact it was almost endemic.  Or do all such vans
have these problems, and it's just something you live with, like BMW
electrical systems or SU fuel pumps?
