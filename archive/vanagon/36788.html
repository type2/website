&gt;On Fri, 23 Feb 1996 09:18:53 -0600 you said:
&gt;&gt;regarding what to do when and I couldn't find anything that said that
&gt;&gt;the coolant should be flushed and replaced every two years. I checked
&gt;&gt;the owner's manual, the maintenance manual, and the Bentley shop manual.
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know where this &quot;recommendation&quot; came from?
&gt;
&gt;that's the really wierd part ... VW never says it!!! but if you call the
&gt;number for the tech help of BASF, the people who make the coolant, THEY
&gt;tell you to replace it every two years. also, Robert Sikorsky says to do
&gt;it in his several books about &quot;How to Drive Your Car Forever&quot; (and some
&gt;other books i can't remember the title of).

Wow.  I'd heard this so often, I assumed it was one of the items listed in
the maintenaince booklet that comes with the car.  I'm gonna double check
mine.
