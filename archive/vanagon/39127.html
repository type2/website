Spake Ron Salmon:

&gt;I find your angry diatribe against Dead Heads both offensive and
&gt;inappropriate for this list...nothing more than stereotyping and
&gt;prejudice...

&gt;...off-the-subject threads...should be limited to those
&gt;that are not devisive, political, or may otherwise be offensive to
&gt;some list members.


(!)

It is a peculiar thing when *Deadheads* cannot countenance an opinion
because it lacks decorum or propriety. Deadheaded bluestockings? Can such a
thing be? ;)
