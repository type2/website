Subject: '73 Westy parts - want list

Now that I have my van on the road, it's time to start making it
functional/presentable.  The body had been lightly parted out before I got
it and is missing a few bits.  I know I will have to buy most of these via
catalog or swap meet, but before I do, let me give you a hand getting rid of
some of that junk you have sitting in the backs of your garages :-).  

I would like to get the following bits:

Pop-top canvas,
Cot/hammock,
Vent tube from sink to roof,
crossover pipe under sink to drivers door,
Hold down rubbers for pop-top,
gasket for rear half of pop-top (front half already on order),
curtains for windshield/drivers/passengers windows (snap in),
light over table (with switches?).

In addition, I would like to add a propane system (heat/stove/reefer) if
possible.

                     TIA,
                     Steve
