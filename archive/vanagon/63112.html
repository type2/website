&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; I am putting a rebuilt engine into my '81.  Several people (including the
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts manager at VW) have told me I would be better off not bothering with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the thermostat.  Some have said to just wire the flappers open.  The guy at
&gt;&gt;&gt; VW said to just remove the flappers completely.&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Some people agree and some disagree with the line of thinking that &quot;if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;cheapskates at VW engineered it into the car, ya better keep it.&quot; I report to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the platoon of beleivers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;After two 914's and two busses, and having spent a year as a motor builder
&gt;&gt;&gt;for a custom VW shop, I would STRONGLY RECCOMEND KEEPING the thermostat and
&gt;&gt;&gt;associated flaps. I can't think of a good reason to get rid of it. You can't
&gt;&gt;&gt;improve your cooling by getting rid of the thermo, and will SEVERELY DEGRADE
&gt;&gt;&gt;your cooling if you REMOVE THE FLAPS.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;This system does nothing more than help the motor achieve operating temp. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;thermostat &quot;opens&quot; at around 250 F, and your cooling air tends to hit this
&gt;&gt;&gt;within five mins with the thermo in place. Like most machinery, your van
&gt;&gt;&gt;operates best at &quot;operating temp&quot;, so what's the issue?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If anything, I would TEST the thermo (see Haynes manual for specs), and
&gt;&gt;&gt;REPLACE it if it doesn't do its thing. I just finished a rebuild on my wife's
&gt;&gt;&gt;new daily driver, a '76 2.0 bus and spent the $$$'s for a new thermo and
&gt;&gt;&gt;attatchment wire. To increase coolin, we added an Empi 8-pass oil cooler
&gt;&gt;&gt;(mounted under the bus, behind left rear wheel) and oil thermostat. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;need more cooling, cool the lifeblood!!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you must disconnect the thermo, leave the flaps, BTW there is no need to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;wire&quot; them open, the little spring on top of the fan housing holds them in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the MAX cool position in case the thrmo fails.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;best of luck, and safe motoring
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;I agree with the believers.  The PO of my 69 Westy took out the flaps when
he installed a Mexican longblock.  I had an ATK longblock installed when the
heads warped during a summer desert crossing - turns out the PO also had an
auxillary oil cooler installed, the type that mounts in front of the cooler
housing intake.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When the engine was pulled for the ATK install the mechanic pointed out
severe accumulation of dirt in the cooler fins - effectively blocking air
flow (I recognized red dust from a sandstorm I passed through in the Navajo
rez).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;With the Aux cooler scrapped and a &quot;doghouse&quot; housing from a later model
installed I had no more overheating but discovered the reality of
overcooling in the wintertime.  My VDO oil temp gauge dipped into the cold
zone while in Yosemite one winter.  I even lost heat when engine loads were
low (downhill glides).  Heat returned, such as it is,  and the gauge rose
out of the blue (barely) on uphill sections.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The moral:  Yes Virginia, aircooled engines CAN run too cool if
functioning flaps are not in place.  VW would not put them there for no reason.
