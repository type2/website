Subject: Re: gas tank...


&gt;with the purchase of the stuff from the '67 westy last week was 
&gt;a second gas tank... no big deal, except it has a small petcock with a 
&gt;lever on it, 'bout 3&quot;-4&quot; of stiff wire to the lever. 
&gt;
&gt;	The Local Bus Gurus have never seen one before... one thinks 
&gt;that it may be from an early Barndoor..

Reserve tap gas tank used thru 1961.
