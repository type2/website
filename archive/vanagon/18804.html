Subject: Vgon seat swap shop

At a wrecking yard in upstate NY, I bought more seats than I need.  Now I
have:
. two front buckets in nubbly fabric that looks good with, but does not
actually match, the original brown 81 LS corduroy.
. two front buckets in brown vinyl, not perfect, but best I've EVER seen
in a wrecking yard
. brown corduroy middle and rear seats in need of restoration; actually the
middle seat is usable as is -- the rear seat is played
. excellent middle and rear seat from late eighties Vgon; tan vinyl trim, 
fabric in tan dots and tan-dots-in-boxes

What I want is a nice interior in fabric with brown vinyl trim.  You can
help:  give me your front seats that match my excellent late eighties
back seats and I'll give you four good front seats; or give me enough money
to have my brown suite (front and rear) recovered ($250?) and I'll give you
the late eighties middle and rear and your choice of the fronts (vinyl or
cloth).  Or if you have another way to what I want let me know.

Wrecking yard is Clarkies in Saratoga.  Several Vgons there awaiting rescue.

Does anyone know what year Vgon had the fabric described above?  Velour
fabric in a dotted pattern, with a pattern of dots in squares on the seating
area proper.  I know it was a Syncro year because I saw a Syncro with the
same pattern in blue yesterday evening.

Thanks for any steps towards my goal.
