&gt;          Cory,
&gt;             I have installed a Locking axil from a Syncro into
&gt;             my 2 wheel drive Vanagon GL.

A good idea.


&gt;	      It by experence improves
&gt;             your tracsion about 20%. The problem with Vanagons is
&gt;             mainly 2 things. (1) Vanagons are front heavy. Yes even
&gt;             with the engine in the rear. Mine doesn't have air
&gt;             witch even makes things worse. (2) Vanagons don't flex
&gt;             as much as the average car. Yes bend in the middle.
&gt;             All cars flex. This helps keep the drive wheels on the
&gt;             ground. Go around a slow bend that has a bad hump in it
&gt;             and you loose tracion. VW new this thats why we have the
&gt;             Syncro.

A bad idea.  You don't want to have your diff locked when cornering,
this will cause one or both wheels to lose traction whether or not
there's a hump.  That's what diffs are for.
I've driven many makes and models of vans and minivans (I was a mechanic)
and find the suspension in my vanagon far better at keeping the wheels on
the pavement than most vehicles.  German vehicles in general are great for
suspension, I find.  Do you have proper tyres inflated to the proper 
pressures?

Oh and please don't drive around slow bends with your diff locked, it's
hell on your CVs.
