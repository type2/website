Sorry to hear 'bout your problem.....you are probably the only
person 'round these parts to have a problem with RMR. They
are usually very responsive....

A couple of weeks ago I was having the upolstery on my '56 re
stitched...there was one minor tear on a small section, and 
the upolsterer could not patch it without new material. I
called RMR and asked if they sold the material only ...
after all it wasn't in the catalog. They said they could
get me some... $25 for a 36&quot; by 54&quot; piece...not a bad
price considering 98% of the interior pieces of the 56
would be original by the time I was done.

They sent the material...to my horror, it was &quot;ribbed&quot; vinyl...
the stuff used in 58-60 bugs. ARRRG!!!! I called....they fixed...
next day had new SMOOTH vinyl.

Today, two weeks later, I received a new package of material..
with a note saying they were sorry about the way the original
was packaged. You see, UPS picked up the first package of
RIBBED stuff and sent it back to RMR. The folks at RMR
got the package, noticed that the company that supplied
the material folded the material and put it in a rectangular
box. As a result the material was creased.

They called the supplier asked them if they sent the SMOOTH
material the same way....the answer was yes. The supplier got
reamed! The supplier sent the new material rolled up in a tube!

So I now have lots of spare upolstery material. It didn't matter
whether the material was creased for the repair. But it was nice
to see how they follow thru!
