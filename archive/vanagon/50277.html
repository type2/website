Jeff &amp; Jean-Marie,

I would be deeply interested in any and all information you have on Vanagon
Drivability Problems!  My mechanic just installed the $100 wiring harness
modification to try and fix my Vanagon problem but it didn't do it!!  He
has already replaced both the Digifant computer and the Air Flow Sensor and
my Vanagon still stops running after 20 minutes and won't restart until I
let it cool back down.

For others that have been following my sad tale I have a new piece of
information.  I have found that if I start my Vanagon and let it idle until
the cooling fan comes on (i.e. warm all the way up), then it runs
PERFECTLY! 

The problem is relate to the temperature transition between a cold start
and fully hot.  Someone mentioned replacing the temperature sensor.  Could
this be a symptom of a bad temperature sensor?  

If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.  I'm going broke quickly
and getting depressed to boot.

&gt; Hi to all the Vanagon readers,
&gt; 	I've been reading some of the problems being discussed here and offered
a
&gt; few solutions for some that I was aware of. I spent 12 years working at a
&gt; VW dealer only to move on to a new career about 5 years ago. I own a 1982
&gt; Vanagon diesel and love it. Don't like working on it any more though.
Just
&gt; got done replacing the valves, the timing belt broke, I consider myself
&gt; lucky. The reason I am writing today is to tell you all about a VW
service
&gt; communique that I was able to get from a friend still at the dealership.
It
&gt; deals with drivability problems with water cooled Vanagons. Intermitent
&gt; missing, cutting out, stalling, etc.. I know that allot of the fixes are
&gt; quite expensive, and may not even work as well as some of the ones
&gt; mentioned on this list. I left the dealership before this document came
out
&gt; so I cannot personally vouch for the repairs. I really don't like making
&gt; suggestions from information provided by other people without trying it
out
&gt; for myself. I figure there may be some of you out there that would try
some
&gt; of the items since there are so many reoccurring problems. (i.e. replace
&gt; ECU and air flow sensor and problem comes back) I was told that this
&gt; information is not to be let out to everybody in its original form. So I
&gt; have condensed the information from 12 pages to 5. Four pages are in Word
&gt; format and the fifth page is a test sheet in Excel format. I do not want
to
&gt; flood people with unwanted or unnecessary mail, and I do not know what is
&gt; in the digests. I will happily send the information to anyone who wants
it.
&gt; If enough people request it I will post the five pages. 
&gt; 	Another quick note. While ordering the parts for my diesel from a
supplier
&gt; that I used to deal with. I asked him if his company does any retail
&gt; business. He said yes so I asked if they stock the water cooled Vanagon
&gt; exhaust parts, they do. I've bought exhaust for my diesel from them and
was
&gt; pleased with both quality and price. The company is New Brighton Imports
&gt; 1-800-621-5125 ask or Bobby.
