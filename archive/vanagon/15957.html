Subject: Want new wheels/Rims for 82 Vanagon

Id like to get some aluminum rims for my 82 vanagon so
I dont have to worry about losing hubcaps any more... are
their other Cars/Trucks with the same bolt-hole pattern
that I can get wheels for? I cant seem to find any
nice wheels at the local wrecking yard and was wondering
if I can venture outside of the volkswagon section...
Do Hondas use a similar pattern? What do I have to look
for?

Thanks,
        Wheel Ign'int  (McNugget!)
