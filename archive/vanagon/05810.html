&gt; Are we all humored, poemed, haikued, or burned out or what? Fridays
&gt; used to be so much fun 'round here....now the only thing i have
&gt; to look forward to on fridays is Joel's list....&lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Come on people, get with it...where's the songs, the mirth, the
&gt; picking on Martha's flannel shirts...

Ah the pressure

A poem

My bus it seems is leaking oil
Something upon which must toil
not from the engine, that's too easy
to fix this I'll get really greasy
the problem squirts from my transmission
a quandry which, by my admission
leaves me in quite a large dilemma
and may shrink my poor wallet slimmer
or shall I take the noble path
and work myself, while others laugh
at my life's passion, and it's fruits
a happy auto, with horn that toots
and mostly carries me along
the stretching roads with happy song
and brings to my sad face a smile
as we traverse the wandering mile
My bus I love, of that I'm sure
there always has to be a cure
I'll feed her oil, to her content
until there's money to be spent
and then to her it all will go
And I at least will always know
that e'er elusive fahrvergnu:gen
that pleasant sense that all is groovin'
And so I bid you all the same
let no one hang your head in shame
should someone nasty point and cuss
Let's all be proud TO OWN A BUS !!!


hope you like it
Richard
