Hello dear VW people=20
This past weekend was the Limbo/Neato Busses By the Arch in St. Louis, MO. =
 Busses came from all over the U.S and even Canada for the weekend.  The=
 event centered on the Saturday 5hr. drive around the beautiful back roads=
 of ol' missouri.  We had +/-53 busses lined up spreading out over a couple=
 of miles for the drive.  What a beautiful sight!  We ran into some trouble=
 when the route we were on turned out to be flooded, but only a few of the=
 lower, and older busses had to turn back.  The rest of us took the plunge=
 and learned that our vans could swim!  Really!  Then we beat the record by=
 squeezing 23 busses onto one ferry.  It was an awesome sight for us and=
 pass byers alike.   The weekend was such a success, I thought I'd share the=
 fun with everyone.  There will be another campout in August.  Pack up your=
 vans and come on out!  Share the VW spirit and keep 'em on the road.......
VOLKSWAGENS FOREVER!!!!   Peace, Dori  and  LUV-LYT '78 Champagne edition tr=
ansporter

Might as well travel the elegant way!
