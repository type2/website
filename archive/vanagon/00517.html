Subject: '94 Westfalia dies on first trip out?!?!
Date: Fri, 22 Apr 94 12:50:23 PDT


Well, not really.  The following is for your enjoyment and is paraphrased
from a conversation that I had with my mother last night  :)
	My mom last Fri. took delivery of a '94 Eurovan with full Westfalia
camping package (not the stripped down version we get here).  Oh, she is in
Schweinfurt, Germany.  She absolutely loves the van, and I am happy too
because now there are two VW campers in the family!
	Anyway, she said she was driving it around the day after she picked
it up (Sat) and all of the radiaator fluid leaked out onto the ground and
it overheated!  She had to have it towed to a garage.  Fortunately it did
not overheat enough to damage the engine, but oh, the embarassment!  The
shop inspected the hoses and found that the lower radiator hose had been
EATEN THROUGH!!
	This is where it gets wierd... Supposedly there is a problem in
Germany (that is nearing epidemic proportions) with a small rodent-like
creature, called something like a &quot;mardar&quot;, I think, which just LOVES to
eat rubber hoses!  Supposedly they can smell the hot rubber smell eminating
from recently parked cars from a long way off, and come running to eat the
rubber from hoses.  Now I know that you're thinking that this is pretty
farfetched, but my mother swears that she has confirmed this from many
separate sources, and she is not the type to play a practical joke on me,
so I believe her.  It gets even wierder though...
	It has gotten bad enough that the Germans are selling netting
for people to put underneath the front of the cars to make it harder for
these creatures to get into the engine area.  These things also don't like
dog hair.  Yes, dog hair.  Apparently people have gone so far as to glue
dog hair on all of their rubber hoses to keep the little beasties away.
I swear I am not making this up!
