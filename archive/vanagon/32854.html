Subject: A Grendel Note


This morning while donning a freshly laundered pair of levis I noticed that
they fit -- no belt required.  During the Grendel Episode I lost so much
weight I had to move my belt over four holes.  Since then my levis have had
plenty of room around the waist.  

It has been nearly four months since I brought Grendel home.  She is slowly
assuming her original factory-built contours and losing weight, a few pounds
of bondo here, a few pounds of bondo there....  :-)  At the same time I've
obviously been regaining the poundage I shed in Washington.  

Saturday I picked up the last batch of photos I'd taken on the trip north,
these covering the last few repairs and the trip home.  The photos, and then
the trousers, served to rekindle memories of that unfortunate trip.

I've decided the damage to Grendel's driver's-side-rear corner is not
repairable.  I'll have to replace that body panel and reconstruct the stub
frame, which has fractured at a severe kink just abaft the tranny support.
 In making the repairs I will incorporate modifications to strengthen those
parts and provide better anchor-points for a towing package.  If there is any
interest in such modifcations to pre-1968 buses, let me know and I will
provide dimensioned drawings.

-Bob
