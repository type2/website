&gt;  I went up to Kohlweiss yesterday and bought those little rubber plugs to
&gt;  keep water from getting in to the rear brakes through the adjusting holes.
&gt;  All I need now is a dry spot so I can crawl under and put them in.
&gt;  I parked it recently with wet brakes, set the parking brake, and when I
&gt;  came back the brakes had seized. It took a substatial application of power
&gt;  and clutch slipping to get them to break loose! Is this a result of metallic
&gt;  pads? Is is stupid to set the parking brake when it is wet out?

my bet is that it is your REAR shoes, and that they have worn down enough for
the rivets to more or less rust (quickly with the heat generated by braking)
to the drums. this has happened on me several times, and i use it as a good
indicator that i need to adjust/replace the rear brake shoes.
