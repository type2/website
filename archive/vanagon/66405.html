Subject:      Eurovan Air Deflectors

A happy tale, for a change!

I recently installed a set of Air Press front window air deflectors
in my Eurovan Camper (95).  These are moulded plexiglass (?) pieces
that fit in the leading and upper channel of the door windows.  They are
retained with a combination of pressure and an adhesive strip.

The results?

Excellent - I can open the windows as much as 5 cm. at highway speeds
with minimal increase in wind noise.  I can also camp in the rain with
the windows open a bit without any water penetrating.

The source?

H P Products
612 Roadway
Paducah KY 42001

The price?

US$ 68.25
