Hi everybody! Her Majesty and I just had a fabulous weekend and I =
thought you all might be interested in reading about it. If any of you =
are interested in taking a look at the Old Girl, here's a URL for a =
page dedicated to one of the CCCs camp-outs. We're the ones in purple.

Kath and Her Majesty - the bus that makes people smile

Confessions of a First Time Exhibitor

One thing for sure, Her Majesty was not created to be a show car, for =
that matter, over the eighteen months that I've been working on her, =
there wasn't even a finalized design plan. She is a work in progress =
that is evolving over time; a work of creativity, driven from the =
heart. So, the idea of entering her in a car show was alien, to say the =
least, especially considering that she isn't even finished. Not to =
mention the fact that I'd never even been to a car show, let alone =
entered one.

Let's back up a little. Fifteen months ago, I went online to research =
the vernacular of your basic VW freak. You see, I was writing an =
article about my bus and I was at a loss for the words to describe =
exactly what I was doing to the Old Girl. Immediately, I &quot;met&quot; Steve =
Johnson who introduced me to the &quot;list.&quot; My next acquaintances were =
&quot;busgirl&quot; AKA Martha Rubin, Bill Abbott and a raft of other members of =
a notorious group aptly named the CCCs - California Camping Crazies.

While online with these fabulous volks, I learned that I was doing a =
&quot;resto-customization&quot; and, with their help, we came up with a better =
name for the Old Girl: Her Majesty, the bus that makes people smile. =
During this time online, we were graciously invited to join the CCCs on =
a couple of their camp-outs, which we could not attend because of our =
heinous winter weather. Six months later, when the weather finally =
mellowed out, we drove south over the Sierra and met the CCCs on the =
Sequoia National Forest. The rest is history. Including a &quot;camp-out&quot; in =
Jeff Carter's lovely home in Tahoe, Her Majesty and I have joined the =
CCCs for five of their wonderful events.

In March, as part of our 8,000 mile spring road trip, we joined the =
CCCs for their camp-out at The Pinnacles National Monument. In the =
evenings, around the fire, there was all this talk of the &quot;Kelley Park =
Vintage VW Show.&quot;  Everybody talked about the next CCC event being a =
leisurely walk through the show. That sounded fine, but, all too =
quickly, that idea blossomed into entering Her Majesty in the show. I =
declined, immediately! To me, that was absurd! She wasn't a show car. =
She was a thirty year dream come true -  just my car, nothing less, =
nothing more! Granted, I was proud of her. Granted, the idea of =
entering her in a show had been thrown around before, but it just felt =
wrong... kind of against the grain. I hadn't created her as a show =
piece, it just turned out that way. As Her Majesty and I pulled out of =
the camp-out, for our trip across the Central Valley and up-up-up over =
the Sierra, I promised my CCC comrades that I would consider joining =
them for a walk through my first car show, if the Sierran weather =
permitted.

Upon arriving home from the Pinnacles trip, my email box was stuffed =
with &quot;Kelley Park&quot; messages. There was everything from URLs about the =
San Jose Historical Museum, the site of the meet, to phone numbers of =
contact people from the Golden Gate Chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen =
Club of America. I went online to the rec.auto.makers.vw.aircooled =
newsgroup and posted a request for somebody to tell me what went on at =
car shows. What ensued was an onslaught of information about shows and =
an incredible amount of encouragement to enter the show. When I =
discussed it with my significant other, Mark, he too hammered on me to =
&quot;GO FOR IT!&quot; It still felt odd to think of putting the Old Girl through =
that kind scrutiny, but part of me started to get wiggly at the thought =
of sharing her with the world. Could I go through with it? Was she good =
enough to show? After all, hadn't I written an article about her, =
complete with professional photos, that Hot VWs rejected? Maybe =
everybody would reject her. What if people really didn't like her? =
Nope, I wouldn't do it. It didn't matter if other people didn't like =
her... I created her for myself and it didn't matter what other people =
thought! At that justification, I resolved to drive my mom's Mercury =
Sable across the Sierra, to join the CCCs for a leisurely walk through =
the show as a spectator, not as an exhibitor. That way I could check it =
out and if it looked cool I could enter it the following year.

Just as I was feeling comfortable with the idea of going as a =
spectator, more email poured in encouraging me to go as an exhibitor. =
Even Mark hammered on me and told me that if I went to the show without =
Her Majesty I would be fulfilling the prophecy of the recurring dreams =
I had been plagued with for over thirty years. The ones where I show up =
for competitive events completely ill prepared - like surfing contests =
where I show up with downhill skis instead of a surfboard or cross =
country ski races where I show up with my moto-cross bike instead of =
skis. Ah... how the creative mind can play tricks on itself! He was =
right! If I showed up at a vintage VW show without my vintage VW, I =
would be living my worst nightmare! If, indeed, I was about to drive =
all the way to the Bay Area, I had to take Her Majesty and that meant I =
had to enter her in the show! I was committed and was starting to feel =
like a little girl the night before her first surfing contest.

In an attempt to find out what I was up against, I emailed &quot;busgirl&quot; =
and asked her what she thought of such a wild idea. Having been to the =
show in years past, she was quite helpful with display ideas and went =
so far as to offer me a place to stay so I could detail the bus after =
the long haul over the Sierra.  A new email pal, Craig Sauls, was also =
a great deal of help. He told me to pack it up, drive over, enter the =
show and have fun doing it! This was to be his first show, as well and =
that was all he could tell me. It was with the support of Mark and =
these two great pals that I embarked upon a four day blitz to prepare =
for my first car show. 

Day One - I rummaged through all my photos and put together a =
chronology of improvements thus far and using PageMaker, I designed =
some pages for a scrap book. I printed up and laminated a few little =
signs to point out some of Her Majesty's amenities and decided to =
dedicate her maiden exhibition to our golden retriever who had recently =
left us to swim in Heavenly ponds. This took all day! Just before bed I =
grabbed the &quot;Project&quot; clipboard and prioritized what had to be done =
before I could leave for Martha's. I always try to follow the &quot;Rule of =
the Six Ps,&quot; Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance but this =
list was overwhelming! Adjust the valves, change the oil, order a new =
distributor cap from my pals at the Mammoth Napa Auto, go to the =
storage unit and get all the Meguire's polishing compounds, rags, =
bucket, Clear Guard... then there was all the stuff I needed for the =
display. ARG! All of this in one day? Whataryakiddin'Me? In the throes =
of exhaustion, I flicked the clipboard on the couch and went to bed.

The night of Day One was a restless one! I sat up with a jolt and =
thought &quot;Girl, what are you getting yourself into?&quot; With a major case =
of cold feet, I decided that there was absolutely no way I could get =
everything done before I had to leave. Plus, solo? To San Jose? Are you =
out of your mind? If you don't get raped, at least the bus will get =
stolen or keyed. What a fool! Nope, I wasn't going to do it! If I went, =
I would take the Sable, screw the show! With that, I dozed, or tried =
to... with an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other having =
quite a debate over my future: &quot;You can do it&quot;  -  &quot;No you can't&quot;  -  =
&quot;Yes you can!&quot;  -  &quot;You'll lose!!! They'll hate your bus, it's =
stoooooopid looking!&quot;  -  &quot; No it isn't, it's beautiful and who cares =
what they think? Just go, be happy, have fun and leave the rest up to =
the Universe!&quot; With that, I must have fallen asleep.

Day Two - the Universe must have heard my guardian angel's closing  =
words, for upon awakening, I was charged with enthusiasm, energy and a =
renewed sense of commitment! Now, where is that clipboard? OK! Off to =
mom's for the family china and sterling silver, don't forget the =
&quot;Scotch Kooler,&quot; paisley table cloth, lace napkins, Great-Grandmas cake =
pedestal, Grandma Gina's purple, cut glass vase for the deep purple =
iris and statice floral arrangement, the Yugoslavian crystal, Baroque =
music for the CD player, a magnum of Champagne, a wheel of brie and the =
cheese board, a French baguette, the bread knife, some fresh fruit, a =
cheese cake, a candy dish to serve matching chocolates... after all, =
this was supposed to be a picnic fit for a Queen! Next, to the library =
for some books on tape, then down to Crowley to get the Old Girl out of =
storage, do the mechanical stuff, go over the tools and spare parts =
check list, charge the cellular, gas her up, grab my surfboard, pack my =
clothes, update the &quot;To Do&quot; list, email Martha, set the alarm, program =
the Universe to watch over me as I embarked on yet another mid-life =
celebration and get some sleep, or at least try to.

Day Three - Blast-off Day - 2:45 am -  eighteen degrees Fahrenheit, =
windy, dark, scary! The trail to the bus was a veritable death walk, =
the snow pack had solidified to a silvery sheen and the switch backs to =
the road resembled the Khumbu Ice Falls on Everest! Better wake Mark up =
so he can help ferry loads. Am I doing the right thing? Oh, who knows, =
drink some coffee, caffeine always makes things look better! Start the =
Old Girl, let her warm up for at least 5 minutes, crank on the gas =
heater, run back inside to give a little dog love to Skadi, grab that =
last cup of coffee, negotiate the Khumbu one more time, pop in a =
fifteen hour book on tape, turn on the headlights, kiss Mark good-bye. =
4:00 am - we're outahere! The Old Girl purred as we slipped silently =
into the pre-dawn chill of the Eastern Sierra. Just as that last cup of =
coffee was taking effect, I found myself gaping at Hale-Bopp scudding =
across the sky above Mono Lake.

Ever have one of those dreams where you can't scream, or run or do =
whatever seems to be the prudent thing to do during a scary  dream? =
Ever have it happen while you're awake? Well, about 2 hours away from =
home, out in the middle of Nevada somewhere, I needed to stop. I needed =
to hang a U turn and drive the Old Girl home, back to the safety of my =
little cabin at 8,600 feet above sea level, away from San Jose, and as =
far away from the perils of the city as I could possibly get! &quot;What in =
the world do you think you are doing? Car shows? Really! You're 47 =
years old for crying out loud - grow up!&quot; the little voice on my left =
shoulder bellowed! The urge to throw Her Majesty into a Bat Turn was so =
strong, I can't believe I didn't do it, but some power beyond my =
control, kept her wheels pointing straight. Straight in the direction =
of Carson Pass, Martha Rubin's driveway and the San Jose Historical =
Museum.

After seven hours on the road, I found myself on Martha's doorstep in =
the quiet little town of Moraga. She is such a gracious hostess! With =
all the fresh orange juice, fat-free bread and soup I could consume, I =
started the long, two day detailing process. We had been on the road =
for almost two months and she was nowhere near ready for her maiden =
exhibition. This was clean the interior day! Six hours into it, Bradley =
&quot;Prunehead&quot;, Martha and her daughter Sarah made me take a break. They =
packed me into Martha's new VW Passat and took me to on a tour of =
beautiful downtown Oakland where I picked up the last minute things for =
the show. Sleep came swiftly that night. I heard nary a peep from the =
debate squad.

Day Four - Exterior Day! Wax on, wax off! I felt as though I had =
auditioned for the lead in The Karate Kid! I was wrecked!

The night of day four - the night before the show. As I put myself to =
sleep each night, I concentrate on the positive experiences of my day =
and project them into the next morning. This way I always have =
something nice to wake up to. This evening, I concentrated on the =
graciousness of my hostess, her lovely daughter and how nice the bus =
looked. In my usual seven syllabled mantra, I repeatedly told myself =
that &quot;Everything will be just right!&quot; - &quot;Go, have fun and be happy!&quot;

Again, the Universe must have been with me, Sunday went beautifully! =
The volunteers from The Golden Gate Chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen =
Club of America were absolutely wonderful! They helped me figure out =
what class I belonged in, gave me the perfect place to park along the =
restored 1940's streets of the San Jose Historical Museum, delivered a =
registration form to me via bicycle messenger and explained that the =
show was judged by its contestants and told me what to do. 

Feeling a little self conscious, I set up my display, &quot;A Champagne =
Brunch Fit for a Queen,&quot; quietly turned on the Baroque CDs, and spent =
seven of the happiest hours of my life talking to hundreds of VW fans. =
There were so many interested spectators, professional photographers, =
ladies telling me that they had used the exact Italian tapestry on =
their living room furniture, kids wondering if the food in my display =
was real or not, teens who totally got off on my paisley outfit, old =
dads wishing they had never gotten rid of their old buses, fellow CCC =
members dropping by to wish me luck, Internet pals whom I finally met =
face-to-face, tech weenies wanting to know everything about the =
installation of my gas heater, paint wizards needing to know the exact =
name of her purpleness, chrome gurus wondering who did such a killer =
job on her bumpers, surfers asking where I surfed, wine connoisseurs =
checking out the magnum, college students begging for pieces of the =
cheesecake, antique freaks admiring the tableware, classical music =
aficionados inquiring about my choice of music, color blind guys asking =
me what color she was, testosterone ridden boys proclaiming that she =
was a total &quot;Chick Bus!&quot;, people wondering what I kept in the Thule =
Magic Box and best of all, one darling young snowboarder type who =
walked up, shook my hand and said &quot;Now, this bus is in SHAPE!&quot; It was =
fabulous!

Toward the end of the day, Martha and Sarah stood by so I could watch =
the end of show proceedings which were held in the town square. There =
was a raffle, which I had failed to buy tickets for and an awards =
ceremony, thank goodness I had voted, where tops in their classes were =
honored with lovely plaques. Enthusiastically I cheered as winners =
accepted their awards. Best this, best that, smiling faces, &quot;Been there =
- Done That&quot; faces - the excited and the blas=E9. Two of our list =
members, Jim and Paula Ellis, AKA &quot;Rusty and Cherry Van Bondo&quot;, took =
second for their perfect 1967 Westy, set up in the genre of the day, in =
the &quot;Luxury Class&quot;, then my newest e-pal, Craig Sauls, took third place =
for his magnificent Crew Cab in the &quot;Working Class.&quot; Then...  out of =
what seemed to be a dream, I heard... &quot;First Place 1968 -1972 Bus&quot; goes =
to Kathy Myers!&quot; Hoh Mahn! No way! Me? Her Majesty? DOOD! I got up and =
triumphantly strode to the announcer, shook his hand, took my plaque, =
turned toward the audience, lifted my paisley skirt to reveal my shiny =
purple tights and said, &quot;She's the purple one!&quot; The crowd cheered! I =
beamed! The Universe smiled down on us!

YES!

As I fired back to the bus, past many a well wisher, Martha looked up =
to see me coming with my plaque. She stood up and welcomed me with open =
arms. Millions of hugs and kisses later, it was time to pack it up. =
Sarah stayed and helped me wash the sterling, wrap the crystal, discard =
the smoldering brie and stow the rest of the display in the Magic Box. =
When all was said and done, we joined the CCC pot luck, right outside =
the gate, in of all places, a shabby parking lot strewn with the =
remains of the pervious night's camp-out. 

The pot luck was perfect! Craig Sauls, his lovely wife and their =
beautiful daughters set up a remarkable table in the bed of their award =
winning Crew Cab complete with yummy fried chicken and rice salad, Al =
Hubbard bought pizza from a wandering pizzaman, Al Knoll, the culinary =
king in his wildflower hunting cap, threw some snags on the barbie, =
&quot;Rusty and Cherry&quot; cranked out a cool and crunchy salad along with some =
killer pasta, Russ Ottey and his daughter Tracy made an appearance in =
their bluest of blue Porsche and the Earnst family graced us with Cajun =
style beans. Sitting amongst the detritus of a weekend passed, we =
reveled in our friendships, heralded our accomplishments and pondered =
our plans for the future.

It was the weekend to end all weekends!

The Universe was with us!
