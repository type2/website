Subject: '87 Syncro Westy for sale
Date: Tue, 31 May 94 11:53:00 CDT


Well I hate to do it but I'm afraid that I'm going to have to sell my '87 
Syncro Westy GL.... :-(((

The question is how much to ask for it...

The &quot;book&quot; value goes from $8,000 to $15,000 depending upon who you ask. 
It's got 71k on it and is showing signs of needing work, dings, (small) rust 
spots, leaking steering rack(?), driveshaft (?) clunk, tires (bad 
alignment), but most of all my wallet says that it's time to convert it to 
cash. :-(

It's currently in St. Louis, MO (missed BBTA because of timing conflict with 
my sisters wedding, it was a tough decision).  I've got an offer for 
$10,000. Is this fair? or should I hold out for more, the buyer seems 
especially interested in the syncro (he already has an '88 westy).

Thanks!

a Westy is the ONLY way to travel, if your not on foot...

Initial pilgrimage: Boston, NH, Burlington Vt, Chicago, St Louis, 
Yellowstone, Victoria BC, ...pacific  coast suppressed but not forgotten..., 
Tiajuana MX (sp?), Las Vegas, North Rim, St. Louis, Various places 
suppressed for fear of digression into melancholy reminisces
