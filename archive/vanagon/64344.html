Volvo window cranks offer the additional clearance you need.  Also, if
you get too &quot;thick&quot; of a speaker they hit the dash if you use the
original speaker holes.

&gt;&gt; Whatever you replace your stock 4&quot; speakers with be certain to check for
&gt;&gt; window crank clearance and that the speaker cover doesn't smash into the
&gt;&gt; side of the dash.  I've seen vans with larger speakers that didn't account
&gt;&gt; for these differences.

&gt;Hi It is possible to bend the crank handles out a little. I had to do
&gt;that after installing some 4&quot; Clarion speakers (the thinist I could
&gt;find) The Clarions made a world of difference from the stockers. Could
&gt;use a little more bass in the rear though.
