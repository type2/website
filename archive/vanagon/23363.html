Subject: more on Wailaki


We're planning on departing in a caravan from my house here in Moraga
on Friday morning at 10 a.m, expecting an approximate 6 hour drive
up to Wailaki.  Some of the group are coming the night before,
Thursday, and any of you who wish to do this are very welcome.  E-mail
me if you need directions

my phone is:  510.376.4321
