Subject: ah, Tires..are these good ones?


hey now,

checked out two types of tires today...any comments/suggestions/flames?

Wrangler Radials, 205/75r14 light truck tires...on sale for $100.68 + 
12.50 balance.

Infinitred 195/75r14 passenger tires...on sale for $94.98 +12.50 balance 
plus $40 mail in rebate for a purchase of all 4.

an extra $15 gets me a plan where i'll get lifetime balance and rotations 
free.

thanks!

jonathan
