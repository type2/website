Subject: '81 westy FS near SF, CA


After much deliberation, I've decided to sell my '81 westy.  Don't
think I'm stopping camping:  au contraire, I'd now like to get 
into custom designing my own interior amenities in a high-top.
Not sure yet on which platform, but anyway, here's the particulars:

1981 westfalia ivory-yellow color
4 speed transmission
current/valid registration
factory air-conditioning
mileage:  138K
185R/14 Michelin XZX tires, newish, cable chains included
deluxe camper package; everything present and working
owned by non-smoker

add-ons:  
guages - oil temp, oil press, cyl head temp, volt meter
CB unit - mounted atop box containing guages
Bentley factory service manual
also, I had an external oil cooler added (this is set
to go on automatically if oil temps exceed 185F, but also
has an over-ride switch in case one wants to turn it on
in other circumstances)

upgrades/improvements since I acquired the car at 106K:  
new upholstery everywhere - including padding for beds
new engine, Mark Stevens heads
new clutch, starter, struts, CV joints, master brake cylinder
recent new paint - home job, but looks pretty good.  body is very good
3 extra auxilliary batteries, including 2 golf-carts under rear seat
front floor mats
 
I have all records since I've owned the car, but not from before.
I've had the car serviced/maintained regularly since I've owned it.

Everything is present and operative on the car with the exception of the
following:

faucet knob top is cracked - works on tank water fine, though
missing front bumper end cap
fuel guage - works fine when full, but disappears to below E after 1/3 tank

And yes, the sliding door works perfectly. J:)

I polled several friends from the group; the collective consciousness
suggests that $3,999 is a fair price.  If interested, contact me e-mail (address below).

Thanks,

Martha
