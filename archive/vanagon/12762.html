Subject: diesel smokes severely

Hokay all you oil burners!  Here's a quick question...

I've got an '82 Vanagon with the lil diesel in it.
The problem is SEVERE black smoke when more than 3/4 throttle is applied.
(We're talking james bond smokescreen here)
It seems to be fine if you only dip into the accelerator half way, but
when the 1st hill arrives...  POOF!
I had the injection pump timing checked and it's right on the money.
A friend recommended that I pull the injectors and check for dribbling
or a poor spray pattern...
Does anyone have any other thoughts on things to check/possible remedies?
Thanks!
