Well the first question which needs to be asked is weight (the steamship
company and dock people will want to know.

How much is the tare weight of the vehicle, and what will the gross weight
be after fully laden with fine Cali crystals?

Shouldn't he be importing old vanagons? More capacity, right?

Subject: non-vw ; importing a car

For reasons I can't go into

A lawyer who works for Suzuki who makes the Samurai and also makes it for 
Chevrolet to sell in Columbia needs to import the Chevy version from 
Columbia into the US.  It needs to be done quickly and it probably  doesn;t
have to be permanent.

Does anyone have any idea on how to do this or who to talk to in the 
governemnt about allowing it?

Sorry for the intrusion on the bus lists but you folks seems to know 
&quot;everything&quot;.  No this really isn;t one more lamer trying to import a Bug 
and hiding it...

Seems silly for Suzuki to have to import a Columbian car that they made  but
hey it is a lawyer that needs to do it.  Go figure....
