Got the rings from local FLAPS for $55 cnd for full engine set.  Puting
the rings in proved to be a nightmare.  Trying to get the rings to slip
into the cylinder bores without removing the pistons is possible but it
took two of us 4 hours of fiddleling to get two cylinder sleeves in place.
The first two compression rings are not too bad but the oil rings is a
real bugger !  Definitely need two people, one up and one under to watch
that all edges of the rings slip in the sleeve.  Anyway, it took from 5 pm
till 11:30 to get the two cylinder on, head installed and engine running
again.  All seems fine so far and I will wait until I have more time to do
the other side.  The other problem I had is installing the push rods and
rocker arm assembly.  The push rod do not want to stay put in the hole of
the lifter and keep getting caught on the edge of the lifter.  Pop one in
and go the next and the other pops back out - urg ! - There must be a
trick to this that I don't know.  Anyway, after about an hour of fooling
around I got it.  Well, that's it, back on the road waiting for the next
thing to break !

Cheers

Frank
