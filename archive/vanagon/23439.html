&gt;If I wasn't so much in love
&gt;with the bus I probably would buy a Honda, cept you can't open the
&gt;fridge, wash your hands in the sink or pop up the camper top in a
&gt;Honda.


You also can't open the Honda door and push with your foot as you
putt up that long hill-- seating position is all wrong.  :)
