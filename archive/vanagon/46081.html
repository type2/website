Subject: 4 Headlight sighting

&gt;j g shepard said:
&gt;Yesterday while riding my motorcycle I spotted a vanagon with 4 round
&gt;headlights. I have never seen this arrangment before and was wondering
&gt;if it was some kind of option or was it just someone's idea of
&gt;customizing their VW.

&gt;I met a man at the VW Classic in Irvine, CA in early June who specialized
in Vanagon parts. He had a European replacement for the plastic front grill
of the round headlighted Vanagons. This grill had the typical Hdlights as
well as a set of halogen &quot;driving&quot; lights. I considered it for two nanosecs
until he clarified that he wanted $400. for the set up including the
halogens.  &quot;Quite rare.&quot; (Un-huh~ what the person who'd pay $400 or what!)
Doop, no thanks... I didn't even have the $350. that he wanted for the NOS
side tent that some listees would buy for $600! He went home w/o the tent
and with the the front grill.

&gt;Yup, the others who have responded are correct. I now remember that he did
indeed say that he imported the item from South Africa. I think I can find
the business card if anyone is seriously interested.
