Subject: Any horn pros?


I have a 1980 westy and my horn has never worked since I have had it. 

Currently I am attemping to follow the wiring to make  sure it is wired 
up right.

If anyone knows much about the wiring, from the horn to the fusebox, and 
maybe beyond I could really use the help!  I know there is a brown wire, 
and a yellow wire with a black strip coming out of the horn.

Thanks,

	Kyle
