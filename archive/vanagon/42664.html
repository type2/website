Thanks to the many of you who responded to the poll about where you'd most
like to see this thing held.  As one might expect, all of you wanted to
have it as close to home as possible.  ;)  So, since we are scattered north
and south in the state, I still suggest we go to the camp-spot in the
Sequoia forest we discussed earlier, the same place many of us discovered on
our last trip.  

As this place is in national forest, and kind of wilderness-like, I have to
ask the people who were there to help me reconstruct directions on how to
get there, but here's something to get you generally oriented:

About 23 miles north-east of California Hot Springs, and 1 mile below
Lower Peppermint.  This is all in the general vicinity of being north-east
of Lake Isabella, which is east of Bakersfield.  For those of you coming
from the east, I understand that Sherman Pass IS expected to be open
come Memorial Day, but you may want to phone first to check.  

I'll try to finalize the directions and get them to you during the week
before we depart.  For those of you who were already at this space, it
would be VERY helpful to me if you'd send me your version of how to
get there.  Maybe once that's straightened out, we can put up some ballons
and signs to help people locate the spot.  Even once there, one has to
leave the highway, and offroad a bit to get down to the river.

Remember to sign up for the potluck!

Thanks,

/martha
