Subject:      MXL not all weather?

When I changed tires about 10 months ago, I called VWOA. The &quot;consultant&quot; or
whatever told me they recommended the Michelin MXLs even though they were
205s. He said they felt they handled better. I haven't seen anything saying
they aren't all weather though. They got us through the &quot;Great Snow&quot; this last
winter. Oh, BTW Joel... the MXLs are 6 ply (I remembered there was a Q in your
mind earlier). Anyway, I went with the MXLs and they feel GOOD. They have also
taken The Enterprise (our bus) where no one has gone before :-) Sorry... HAD
to do that!
