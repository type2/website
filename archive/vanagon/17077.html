Subject:       Re: Who needed early bus rear bumper?

&gt; I remember someone saying they needed an early (195?) bus bumper.  Today in
&gt; the paper there was advertised a '63 bus rear bumper &quot;with overriders&quot; - $60.
&gt; If anyone is interested, let me know.

I'm after the bumpers.  But it is for a '57.  They are the blade 
bumpers w/o any over-riders, and they have the mega chrome on them.

I do already have a set of '60s w/ the overriders and chrome and 
rubber (which are for sale if anyone is interested.  They are in very 
good shape (no major dings/little surface rust).)  &lt;-- Shameless ad.
