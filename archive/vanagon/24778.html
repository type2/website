Subject: RE: The DGF and Vanagons


&gt;The aspect of
&gt;modern driving that makes me crazy is the Don Garlitts factor (DGF).

You're not the crazy one. Look behind you...


&gt;If I am
&gt;the first vehicle in line (the Vanagon Westy) at a red light I observe the
&gt;flowing sequence of events following the changing of the red light to 
green:
&gt;The head of the driver directly behind me instantly ratchets from side to
&gt;side looking over both shoulders at a high rate of speed.(like a
&gt;quadraplegic on crystal methamphetemine trying to get millions of spider
&gt;mites out of their ears.) Next, the driver's torso begins squirming around
    (snip)
&gt; I am usually almost ready to shift
&gt;into second gear by this time.

If the guy is still behind you, put it in second, let out the clutch, and 
then
wait an additional  two seconds before accelerating. Drives 'em nuts.
