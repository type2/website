Subject:      Re: Hot VW's artical

I hate to &quot;migrate&quot; some of the comments from the VintagVW list about Hot
VWs, and VW Trends over to this list, but what the hell....

These magazines are a total waste...maybe the mis-spelling of &quot;article&quot; in
the subject line of the original posting was a Freudian slip...
but it sort of represents the lack of  editorial quality and integrity found
in those magazines.

For example, invariably there will be a large ad in one of the issues...
and a couple of pages later there will be an article praising the product of
the advertiser. I do admit, the &quot;tits and ass&quot; component of these magazines
has been lowered a tad lately...but the editorial content is still at the
6th grade level.

IMHO, this list is a better source of information, entertainment, etc. than
Hot VWs or VW Trends....its more accurate, probably less biased (we don't
cater to advertisers) and more immediate (you don't have to wait for months
or years for the info you want to appear).
