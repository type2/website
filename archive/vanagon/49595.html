&lt;&lt; Platinum Spark Plugs??????$#%#$%^
 
        In a matter of time your Vanagon will quit dead! Platinum plugs
        cause, (only in the Vanagon) the coil to over heat and finally
        quit!     A how long have you had them in?
  &gt;&gt;
Eric, You have got to be kidding! Ive run platinums in my 84 Westy for over
10 years and 200k mi and am running on the orig. coil.What possible
correlation could this have to the coil?If it has a higher resistance the
 coil will not be damaged and it couldnt possibly have zero ohms as the plug
would be shorted to the electrode.Big deal.
