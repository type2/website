&gt; 
&gt; Could anybody give me directions OR point out how to find info in the
&gt; FAQ on Installing a 2nd/auxillary battery. Any personal experience
&gt; would also be helpful.
&gt; 
	I've installed an aux batt. with an isolator. Works great!

	The isolator is made by Sure-Power in Tualitin OR.. 503-692-5360

	I think the model for the Vanagon = 952R

	I mounted the isolator in that unused space in front of the left-rear
	taillight.

	I put the battery under the rear seat. Too big for space under driver's
	seat. As long as it's not being charged when still, I'm not concerned
	about hydrogen gas.
