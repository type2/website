&gt;&gt; Several list members inquired if we can receive the same format for the
&gt;&gt; Digest mail as we did with the old list.  Each posting used to have a
&gt;&gt; corresponding number with the numbers from the table of contents, making
&gt;&gt; finding a specific message very easy, without having to go through all
the
&gt;&gt; messages.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So far I haven't seen any response to anyone's postings that inquired
about
&gt;&gt; this.  Is this possible to accomplish?  It would be soooo nice to have
this
&gt;&gt; feature again.
&gt;
&gt;We (Ron &amp; I) could not find this function in the LISTSERV software
&gt;documentation, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Ron has contacted
&gt;our rep at LSOFT to see if the digest numbering option is available, and
&gt;if not, if it can be written into the program. Although, the later won't
&gt;help us much because we purchased an unlimited license for the current
&gt;version ... no updates, etc. (this kind of license sells for $2K/yr, big
&gt;ouch!). Maybe we can get a beta version ?
&gt;
&gt;We'll let everyone know as soon as we hear something.

Here are the results of the numbering digests inquiry.

Unfortunately, ListServ doesn't support numbering digests.  What they *do*
support is MIME digests, which is an internet standard.  Unfortunately,
Eudora doesn't support this standard.  Also unfortunately, LSoft (the
company that produces ListServ) is rather customer-unfriendly and is not
willing to talk with Qualcomm to  get this problem fixed.

The good news is that there is a free mail package called Pegasus that
fully supports MIME digests.  It's a very good package, and has all of the
features of Eudora Pro.  If you're willing to switch mailers, then you can
turn on MIME digests by sending the following letter to
listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu:

     set vanagon mime

If you *do* own Eudora, send mail to eudora-suggest_at_eudora_dot_com asking them
to support MIME email digests.
