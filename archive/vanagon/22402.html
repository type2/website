Subject: Re: Vanagon starter switch problems

I had something similar to this happen to me a couple of weeks back.  
After viewing a local garage sale I jumped into the Vanagon, started it 
up and the horn starts blowing.  It took me a couple of seconds to 
realize that it was my horn and quite a few seconds more to discover the 
problem -- one of the keys on my key ring had become lodged between the 
steering wheel and column (completing the horn circuit).  The blast 
lasted over 15 seconds and turned every head at the garage sale ... how 
embarassing. :-0

&gt; switch.  I pulled the wiring harness connector off the switch and a dime
&gt; falls to the floor.  Yes, a ten cent coin!  Upon further inspection numerous
&gt; coins were found!  It seems that my daughter (then 3) had been playing by
&gt; taking coins from the coin box (sometime called an ash tray) and sticking
&gt; them through every crack she could find.  This dime had managed to get in
&gt; sideways between the switch and the connector!  This shorted out two
&gt; terminals on the switch caused a bit of heat &amp; melt and took out the circuit
