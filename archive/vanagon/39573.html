Subject:  '84 transmission - are they just crap?

phoned the guy from Transform, i guess the rebuild thing requires
something to rebuild (doh), and seeing as UPS doesn't even serve Whitehorse,
and what the heck would i do with my van while the old transmission is 
being poked and prodded by the US customs guys (i think the Canadian ones
are much worse, like, what are you gonna smuggle from Canada, Maple Syrup?)
(yeah, way to leave it till the last moment)

BUT, he did tell me about this new thing they were working on, it is a 
conversion kit so you can use '80-'82 vintage transmissions in an '84 van...

he said that the former transmissions will last forever!!!
he said that the later transmissions are &quot;CRAP&quot; (they don't typically last
more than 100,000km)

(guy from Transform: &quot;the first time we opened up one of those new ones, 
                      we couldn't believe it!&quot;)

this i Could believe, now that i've tried to find an '84; if demand is so
high, they must live a very short life.

i thought NEW was BETTER!!!

has anyone tried to put an older tranny in their water cooled vw?

the kit should be out in a couple of months from Transform
