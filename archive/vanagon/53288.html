Hey all,
I've gotten a lot of responses about my questions re quartz halogen
brake/back-up lights.  The consensus seems to be that it's not really worth
it.  Mike West pointed out that (according to a Sylvania package he had in
his possession) halogen bulbs burn 50% brighter than their tungsten
cousins.  So the 20-watt quartz halogen that RMMW sells for this
application would put out as much light as a 30-watt tungsten.  Well, I've
got 35-watt tungstens in there now so switching to halogen seems like a bad
idea.  William McKinley and Joel Walker both expressed concern about the
heat from these halogen bulbs.  William was concerned about the heat source
being placed closer to the lens through the use of the adaptor (is it
adapter or adaptor?) and Joel cited some real-life experience where the
halogens got the lens too hot to touch.  I don't like that idea as those
Vanagon lenses are $100 a piece.  Joel's solution to the matter, in typical
Joel fashion ;) , is more lights, not brighter lights.  If anyone's seen
pictures of his van, you were able to predict his response ;) .  Joel
suggests extra brake lights in the rear window as well as a bumper-mounted
fog light for extra back-up brightness.  I don't think I'm into adding
extra lights, I just want to improve what I've already got.  

I noticed driving behind Rick Koller that his brake lights in his '87
Syncro Westy (nice van!) are really effective.  They give that
high-intensity effect.  You know, when you first see them it kinda makes
your head hurt.  Rick, could you pop off one of your lenses and see what
kind of brake lights you have in there?  I'm curious if they're halogens or
not.  If they're not halogen, what are they?  You really notice those
lights.  

I'll probably just stick with what I've got now.  Those 35-watt tungstens
are pretty bright, they just don't give that high-intensity halogen effect.
 William McKinley pointed out that halogens put out a lot of UV, maybe
that's what gives you the headache? :)  I want tailgaters to feel that
pain. :)

Thanks for all the responses, and if anyone else has $.02 to add, please
do.

Sean
