  I've seen some pretty strange stuff used to funnel more cool air into
the engine bay.  Mostly on split window and bradloaf busses.
  On splitties, the square louvered area cut out and a white plastic
scoop pop-rivetted on.  One side or both.
  On breadloaf bodies, louvered hood with a metal screen held in place
from the inside.  The most ingenious was an older gent with a '68 Westy.
He used black rubber (like a mud flap) to fashion some &quot;ears&quot; which are
bolted to the air scoops at the top of the rear pillars.  I bet it works
great, but the van looks like Mickey Mouse chuggin' down the street.

  I'm not sure how much these alterations really effect the oil temp.
Personally, I tend to want to keep things stock, Especially when it
comes to cutting into the sheet metal body.
