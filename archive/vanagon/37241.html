Subject: Stabilizer Arm 

Hi all. While in the process of putting my new windshield washer pump,
thanks to the Parts Place, I noticed that my left stabilizer arm dangling.
This vehicle is my 86 Westy syncro. This is the arm that has a ring around
the top that goes around the front stabilizer bar and then attaches, when
the bottom bolt is nto broken, to the control arm. Now, is it safe to drive
this way? I have no idea how long it has been broken. Can I repair this
piece alone or is it major investment time for all the parts? Thanks all.
