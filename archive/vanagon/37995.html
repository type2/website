Subject: Re: Overheating symptoms?

Great thread going here. Very important, helpful information.

Does anyone have a sense of temp limits at the air exhaust. I don't yet 
have any of the temp sensors, but I have a nice little oven thermometer 
that I've stuck into the tailpipe to get temp readings. Doesn't work 
very well while moving, however.

Thanks! Joe
