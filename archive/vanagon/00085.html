Subject:      parts you might want to get for your vanagon (1980-1983) models.

as i was looking through my records on my 1980 bus, i noticed a couple of
things that some of you might want to check out:

the 80 bus passenger door couldn't be locked from the outside without a key.
i didn't care much for that, so when the 1982 (?) models came out that COULD
be locked without a key, i checked into it.  you can order the lock, part no.
251-837-016A (it was $25 back then) and as i recall, it was very simple to
swap out. it's the big brass looking thing on the edge of the door. it doesn't
change the key cylinder at all ... and makes life so much easier.

the 80 model also had a problem with idiot gas station attendents trying to
put gas into the oil spout behind the license plate. one of the later years
had a new oil cap with the word 'OIL' on it in big silver letters. naturally,
i ordered one. :)  part no. 070-115-319  cost (then) $4.38. well worth it.
note: it won't stop the idiots, but you can really scream at them about not
being able to read!!! :)
