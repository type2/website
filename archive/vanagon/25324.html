It would be kind of nice to have a second 150 Amp
alternator put in, though :-) (do they even make these things???)

Hola Cetin!

150 amp alternator x 14 volts = 2100 watts.  There are 749( or so) watts per
theoretical hp. =&gt; 2.8 hp.  I have a 2000w generator for emergency use ( I
live in Earthquake country, just south of San Francisco)  and it has a 5 hp
engine. ==&gt;( 2 )150 amp alternators would probably want around 8-10 hp --  on
a 48 hp engine driving a van????  Whoooooo nellie!!!

Do they make such things?  I think possibly so.  A good bet for 18 wheeler
trucks?   I have a vauge recollection of such animals being advertised in
regard for folks that put  multiple mega monster stereo amps in cars.
