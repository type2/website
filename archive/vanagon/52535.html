Pull the plugs and V/Cs to check things out.  If it's been sitting it might
take a little effort to turn it, but examine the plugs and check the valve
train as well as what color or condition the oil is in.  If it's dark
black, fouled or smelling of gas or diesel fuel stay away from it, or for
$100.00 it might be a good rebuild candidate but only if it turns!

&gt; hi volks
&gt; 
&gt; have a question 
&gt; 
&gt; found a motor head to head with alt. for 100.00 smackers. person said it
ran
&gt; great before the van was totalled (front end). its been sitting on the
&gt; concrete floor for 2 years. it wont spin by hand we will be taking tools
the
&gt; next time we stop over to the guys house. is there anything special i
should
&gt; look for as far as problems? i mainly deal with air cooled motors for my
&gt; type 1-2-3 but this monster is a bit different. and if the heads are good
&gt; i.e. crackless than i was planning on replaceing intake and exhaust
valves
&gt; and guides install new head gaskets and such and be on my way.
&gt; 
&gt; reason i ask is my 86 vanagon (i.e.terrorist bus) with a mere 160k miles
&gt; seems to have a problem with compression. say 120,121,147,168psi per cyl.
i
&gt; say she is just getting broken in. good thing is she burns no oil. heads
do
&gt; not leak external but believe theyre leaking internal. i loose power
after
&gt; warm up.
&gt; is there anything that i should know before starting this fun project?
&gt; 
&gt; any input would be greatly appreciated
&gt; thanks Jonce
