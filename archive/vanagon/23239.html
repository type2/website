Subject: RE: subtract one from the stats


&gt; After I drive the car and get the engine nice and warm and then park
&gt;somewhere for say 15-30 minutes, I have a hard time starting it.  It just
&gt;turns over and over and over for about 30 seconds (sometimes longer) before
&gt;coming to life.


Sounds like you're running rich when warm.

Could be:

1. Stuck or broken electric choke (unlikely, since they usually stick
open, making cold-idle shitty but warm starting/running fine)

2. Misadjusted carb idle air and/or idle screw. St. Muir has a good
procedure for adjusting this.

3. Wrong float level in the carb. Several possible causes-- a saturated
float (replace it), a loose needle valve seat (tighten it), a wrong
adjustment (this one never bit me, so I have no clue, but may be
pretty simple).


Course, if it were me, I'd get rid of that POS 34-PICT carb, and put
on a Weber 2-barrel progressive. In California, this would cause the
local revenooers (EPA) to lick their lips in anticipation of jailing
me. If they found out.
