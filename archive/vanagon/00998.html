Subject: Re: How to get to stuff on camper luggage rack?


I asked about my 1973 camper:

&gt;Now a new question.  How do you camper owners get up to your luggage
&gt;rack on top of the bus/vanagon?  I was putting some stuff up there
&gt;last night and used a step stool but I don't really want to haul
&gt;the step stool around.

Joel Walker replied about how to build a step:

&gt; well, one thing i cut out of a magazine and 'one of these days' i'm gonna
&gt; make, is a folding step that 'hooks' over the top of the tire, like so:

(great description deleted...)

Excellent idea Joel, thanks much for the ascii-art etc.  Unfortunatly, on
my '73 the pop-top opens on the front and the luggage rack is in the back
of the vehicle.  My spare tire is mounted on the front so the step you
describe wouldn't help in this case.  (I think the pop-top started opening
the other way in 1974 (?))

It might be reasonable to buy or construct a single free-standing step
that would fold and store in one of the cupboards.  I'll try looking around
at RV supply stores.

Cheers,
