Subject: cleaning carburator

&gt;From: Jose Antonio Madriz &lt;madriz+_at_CMU.EDU&gt;

&gt;Hi all,

&gt;I'm about to rebuild the carburator of my '73 bus and was wondering
&gt;what you guys recommend for a thorough cleaning. Specifically, I want
&gt;clear  all passages with compressed air, but can not do this with the
&gt;normal air hoses provided in gas stations (can not control the
&gt;direction and flow of the compressed air by just pressing valve with
&gt;the finger). Does there exist a nozzle out there to hook to these air
&gt;hoses and make it easier and more precise to direct the compressed air
&gt;into the small passages of the carburator? If not, any other ideas?

&gt;Thanks!

I've found that there is enough air pressure in the aerosol
cans of carb cleaner to blow out anything that's in there.
With the carb soaked/covered with the carb cleaner fluid,
residue and particulate matter flows freely with little need
for pressure.

Certainly there are nozzles which fit on air compressor
lines but gas stations normally don't use the &quot;quick
release&quot; fittings on hoses available to the public
eventhough they use them in their shops.

Have fun!
