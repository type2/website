&gt;      VW-'87 Vanagon Synchro, 4WD 5 spd, AC, Am-Fm cass. 1 owner, all
&gt;      records. Excellent cond! $6775. 451-2948 after 5pm
&gt; 
Well I called about it, thinking about it for dad, 100k miles but
recently NEW TRANSMISSION, but never any engine work, heads
are origional, etc. etc. got the son of the owners they are
out of town, he was not sure but also thought origional exhaust,
so this thing could be looking at $3000+ in repairs any time soon
still the price seems appealing for a religiously dealer maintained
1 owner Syncro with a new tranny, any opinions?  It is in Norfolk
and the son was happy enough to have anyone come by any time to
look at her.
