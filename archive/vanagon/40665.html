Subject: Info wtd: Puyallup meet April 28th?

Hi all!

Anyone heard about a VW meet in Puyallup, WA this weekend?  I thought 
Clara made mention of it last week, but I could be wrong.

Anyone else heard about this?  I have *no* information about where it is, 
etc, and Christa managed to get a day off (surprise!), and seeing as how 
it's our 6th anniversary on Monday, we thought a VW meet would be the 
perfect way to celebrate!  (Uh oh: Item #823 on how to tell if you're a 
VW fanatic...)

If anyone could tell me more about the meet, or tell me if I even have 
the dates correct, I'd be most grateful!  

Tobin
