Subject: dash,odo,gauges

Hi all-
        Today I got an bold streak, and took apart my dash on the 71 westy.  
I removed the spedo, and set it to zero miles.  The DPO says thats about 
right.  The spedo cable broke 2 years ago.  I like it, 'cause Now I just 
look at the dash and boom! there's the milage on the new engine, and bus.  
While I had the dash out I cleaned it up real good, and used my green 
scrubber on those heater/vent controls.  Wow, they are 2 different colors!  
Real pretty now.

I do have 3 questions:

1) to the right of the spedo, there is a dummy gauge, was there a factory 
option gauge for this hole?

2) Just under the said gauge hole, there is a red light thingy with a &quot;B&quot; on 
it.  Anyone know what this is?

3) I found out that I have a frozen heater cable on the right side.  Any 
ideas short of replacing it?

Thanks
