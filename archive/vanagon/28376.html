&gt;Well, I don't know about MD law, but I do know about my cars.  My '63
&gt;Dodge has none.  My '65 Chevy has only two seat belts, but can seat six.
&gt;And my '66 Kombi only had 2 front belts, and one front seat, I added
&gt;anther front seat, and a rear bench including seat belts.

My dad's '60 Sunbeam Alpine came from the factory with seat belts.
So did his '63 Ford Falcon van.
