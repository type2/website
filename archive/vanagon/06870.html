I would not jump to the conclusion that you need to remove the fridge in
order to get a flame. As most will testify on the list, getting a blue
flame requires technique and will involve a great deal of initial
frustration. Here is what some have suggested:

Get the propane flowing by lighting both burners...

Pump at least 20 -25 times AND hold the pump in while turning the piezo...

You need to repeat the procedure at least 3-6 times if the system has not
started up in awhile....

 You will hear a definite whuuump when the flame lights...

You will know it is lit if a) there is a blue flame in the sight glass;
and b) the red LED glows for longer than 30 seconds....


The propane dial must be fully open below and on the cabinet...

Cold temps may make it more difficult ot start...

We were about to give up and remove the fridge, but persevered with  the
above..

Others will also have helpful hints....
