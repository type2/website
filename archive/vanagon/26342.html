Subject: Re: Oil Sump Gripe

be careful with altering the oil sump plates studs.  The metal's soft so if
the studs are screwed in and out, or bolts are used, the threads will lose
their grip and one day one might just fall out when you are driving along.
  This happened to a friend of mine- time for a new motor.   ackkk
