&gt;No. The filler tube of my 83 camper is original and the camper was purchased
&gt;in California. It has been through smog checks without any question on its
&gt;fuel fileer cap and filler tube (all visible). Its filler tube's diameter is
&gt;obviously bigger than my 84.

it's highly possible that you have a euro-filler-tube ... which was, at one
time, orderable from the parts people (prior to the epa clamping down on
that stuff). on my 80 bus, i replaced the catalytic converter with a pipe
from a canadian 80 model ... and got the part from the vw parts folks. had
to order it, of course. then, since i could now run leaded gas, i ordered
the euro-filler. and got it. it was just a bigger throat on the outside,
an easy swap.

now, as for the choking, i'd bet (like someone else said) that you have a
blocked vent tube. mine had a little tube than ran from behind the body
skin, down to the tank and went into the top of the tank.

now, looking at my german parts catalog for the 80-85 models, it shows
four (4) different filler necks tubes, but only two (2) throats (leaded
or unleaded, i guess). ALL of the filler tubes have the little vent tube
(which all go to the same place in the top of the tank). the only thing
that looks different on the little vent tubes are:
version 1 - solid tube, plugged into a big gasket right at the throat.
version 2 - throat has little stub-tube molded into it, connected to a
            one-piece vent tube by a rubber hose and clamps.
version 3 - different shape stub-tube molding, but basically the same as
            v.2, but the connection rubber hose is much much smaller and
            no clamps.
version 4 - pretty much the same as v.3, with the throat area being a little
            different shape.

now, different, evolving versions over time? different for different
countries? i don't know. but i would check that vent tube, particularly
the area around the top of the tank (you might be able to get to it from
the front wheel area ... maybe. the tank connection is at the very front
right corner of the fuel tank). since it seems to have been doing it from
the beginning, i'd bet that this is plugged up.
