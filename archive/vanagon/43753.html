A.K.A. loves to ride in my campers.  He likes the van because it usually =
means a trip to Two Medicine Lake.  He'll sit in the passenger seat if I =
leave the door open when we're in the back yard.  His new favorite spot =
is on top the stove in the vanagon.  I worry about him falling off when =
I turn curves.  I never let him ride up there if I'm going over 20 mph.  =
He's a pint sized reservation mutt that got lucky.  He was destined for =
a shotgun death, but I met him in front of the gas station and saved =
him.  For the first few weeks he slept in my van and wouldn't come =
out--scared of being left I assume...
