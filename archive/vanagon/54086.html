Subject: Exhaust parts for CA '80 2.0l FI needed!!!

Urgent!

I am looking for exhaust parts for our CA model '80 Vanagon (2.0L FI),
especially the cross-over pipe, muffler and tail pipe. Main problem is the
cross-over pipe, and the dealer gave me a price of &gt; $ 500 on it alone (and
no, it is NOT made of gold). The CA layout differs (as far as I know) from
the standard one in that the catalytic converter is on the left side to the
front and parallel to the left heat exchanger, rather than to the left rear
and parallel to the muffler.

Any advice on (legal in CA) solutions, sources for affordable parts etc.
would be appreciated.

Please send a copy of the reply to me directly (mgdoherr_at_ucdavis_dot_edu) since
I am currently (due to overflowing mailboxes) on digest for both lists.

Thanks

Marcus
