Subject: Re: RE: shower in a westy!

The setup I had contemplated was using the regular drinking water tank for
shower purposes. It is 10 gallons. I take 1/2 hour showers normally but in
the van, under the rear hatch, I have found it only takes me 2 or 3 gallons
to get a good shower.

The big qustion is how to heat the drinking water. I think the way the
australians do it is to circulate coolent water, through a copper tube,
through the drinking water tank until the temprature of the drinking water is
the right temperature for showering. I am planning to go this route I think
but I want an automatic valve that will turn on and turn off the flow of
coolent through the copper pipe depending on the temperature of the water in
the drinking water container. I cannot find such a valve--that is, a valve
that will open or close depending on the presence of 12volt??? electrical
current that I would get from the thermostat that I would lower into the
drinking water tank.

Also a problem is the plumbing to convert the coolent water into the copper
tube.
