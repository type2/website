  I asked a chemist who sits down the hall from me here; he says water
  is soluble in alcohol (doesn't seperate) and is carried through the fuel
  system in solution. 
  More anecdotally, I've heard that an occasional tank of ARCO is a good way 
  to get/keep water out of the tank. True? I don't know.


  Regarding the little silver socket: Is there some european (DIN?) standard
  12V outlet that is used over there the way we use cigarette lighters here
  as a source of 12V for accessories?
