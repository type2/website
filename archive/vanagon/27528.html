&gt;so you can not just bolt up a 5 in place of the 4-cyl. The 5 and 6-cylinder
&gt;engines are identical.
&gt;
&gt;Do the wasserboxers have the same bolt pattern as the  watercooled VW
&gt;engines? What about the aircooled Vanagons? Do they use different
&gt;trnasmissions and/or bellhousings for the aircooled/wasserboxer/diesel?

diesels have a different bellhousing from gas,  that's about as far as I can
go.  The 091/1 4spd. trans was in both air and H2O vanagons, diesels got
five speeds (sometimes)  Syncros have 094-4WD.  So I've no real idea about
gas engine bell housings&lt;g&gt;.
        
        Some measurements from an Audi 5cyl,  length from engine flange to
pulley 23.25&quot;, plus about 3&quot; extra for rubber mount, vs. 22&quot; for vanagon gas
engine length,  with lots of room once the VW muffler is gone! 
Wonder how long the 6cyl is?? any takers?
        
        A crossbar further back, near end of box beams looks feasible, to
mate with standard Audi mount.  Side mounts (2) on Audi about 6&quot; back from
engine flange, also feasible, but with 2 stub 'cross' bars, not a single one.
        Engine height approx. 18&quot; centre of flywheel to valve cover, vanagon
is approx. 12&quot;.  Tip the Audi lots, or raise the lid?
    
        Good points, starter for Audi is on engine, not trans, thus no
problems, important for TD swap.  Non-turbo engine 'bulk' is much smaller.
Water pump etc are within 23.25&quot; length.  Mid 80's engines appear to be
mechanical FI (true?) less 'brain' to swap.
