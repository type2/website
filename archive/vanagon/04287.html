Subject:      All those needing stove flue caps...

I called Pete at Euro-American RV Products (you may know them as Delta-Six
Industries- but this is the retail wing). The stove flue cap was $6.50. The
lowest he can charge (UPS set) shipping is $5.50 but this is still cheaper
than VW. He has anything that is part of the normal camper package. BTW, the
part number for the flue cap is 253 070 688A. For those of you not living in
the US, I'm not sure what shipping is. The phone number is (818) 760-4214 and
FAX is (818) 760-4216. I also ordered a new gasket for my skylight, and a new
set of doors for the water and electricity hookups. BTW, has anyone figured
out how to wire up another light such as that in front of the closet door?
Pete has them for 29.25 and it would be nice to have one for the cargo area.
