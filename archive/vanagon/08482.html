&gt;&gt;       Bottom line, folks: Should I attempt to re-use a case, crank,
&gt;&gt; rods and heads from an engine that burned a piston after only a few
&gt;&gt; hours of running? Has anyone got experience CA smogging a dual-port big-bore
&gt;&gt; when a single-port 1600 was stock? Can anyone recomend a shop for
&gt;&gt; air-cooled machine work in the South Bay?

&gt;Smog is a non-issue for that old of a bus Bill.  Even if it was, a newer
&gt;engine would be acceptable.

Seems to me when I got my '59 registered, they are requiring smog checks
for foreign cars back to '64. But I don't know what they check.

&gt;I'd get a new case and not trust the burned one.

That I'd agree with...
