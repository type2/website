Subject:      window screens

in the latest LiMBO newsletter, these folks were listed as suppliers for
Westfalia screens ... in this case, for the front doors. they are magnetic
with a strap at the top (to put over the door, then close the door to keep
the screens from 'walking off' by themselves). they are said to also make
rear screens and door screens for most VW Type IIs.  it might be worth
checking into.
