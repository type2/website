Subject: poptop gasket

        The rubber gasket on the poptop of my '84 Westy has started to
droop. The loose area has grown from about six inches to 18 inches in the
span of a month. I need to stop procrastinating and do something quick.
        I'm trying to decide whether I should: 1) try to glue the offending
area back up with the thought that the rest of it will remain intact; or 2)
punt and buy a replacement now.
        Any suggestions from volks who have been in the same situation?
