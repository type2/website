This bounced - I don't know if it made it the first time..

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, can anyone tell me when European busses ceased to have 
&gt; &gt; semaphores.  I saw a green kombi with the same taillights as my '57, 
&gt; &gt; but not turn signals, and I couldn't see any semaphores by the doors.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Odd!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I'll guess that they stopped the same year as the bugs--1960

The book I have, &quot;VW Transporter 1949-1967&quot; says they stopped using
them on the Euro busses in '62, which would mean that Euro busses
never had nipples... nipple lights.

Has anyone considered the exploitation of the cars when the use them
to promote semi-naked women in the mags?  Are we so human-centric that
we forget that we have to consider the car's feelings?
