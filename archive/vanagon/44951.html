I like this suggestion. I'm always wondering WERE in
h-e-double-hockey-sticks these magical buses are, and it would be nice to
have that information so I didn't have to e-mail away for it.

The rest of the suggestions, I'm afraid, don't strike my fancy (vancy?)
much. Seems like an awful lot for an awful lot of people to remember, and
every new traffic rule takes a little bit of the fun out of the &quot;atmosphere&quot;
of the list. Makes me pine for the days when Martha could deliver 17 puns to
the list in one day, and no one cared, we just laughed. I know, I know, as
the list grows, so must our responsibility.... But sheesh. These seem like
awfully specific rules. 
If you've got mail software that sorts, then you've also got the ability to
delete mulitple messages at a time manually; I wouldn't think it would take
long to weed out the ones that by their subject line (imprecise and
misleading as it may sometimes be) tell you that you don't care about them.
Sure, sometimes you'll still end up reading some trash and deleting some
gems, but for the most part, it works for me. Now maybe this just won't work
for those of us on mulitple lists--but then maybe the problem is subscribing
to too many lists, eh?
