Subject: Re: Advice Needed: Poptop Seal - 82D Westflailia

&gt; I am going to do it!  The old, crusty, rotted seal is going to be 
&gt; replaced.  But with what - and from whom?
Rear section $ 99
Front (luggage rack) section $ 39
California Imports, Burnaby, BC (CDN prices)
I think West Coast Metric carries similar in the US.
 
&gt; I've seen many sugestions for poptop seals.  What do you prefer?  I once 
&gt; read of a seal made with aluminum (rustproof) clips.  Does nayone have 
&gt; any info?  Are the aftermarkets as good as the OEM?  What are my 
&gt; choices?
I bought the above seal in March, with aluminum clips. Installed 
without glue since I planned on removing to repaint the top. (used a 
bit of 3M sealant at front joins only). Clips hold very tightly, so 
glue probably isn't needed. Better than OEM due to rust proof 
construction, although rubber probably not quite as good.
