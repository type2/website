Subject: Re: Heater boxes, overalls, gasoline politics


&gt;
&gt;	Oh, and speaking of political gasoline buying, my current
&gt;vendor (Shell) is one of the largest producers in Nigeria... which
&gt;just hanged a group of environment/human-rights activists... so
&gt;I may have to take my $100/month gasoline habit somewhere else.
&gt;

And my life just gets that much more complicated and expensive.  I knew
this, and I remeber hearing it on NPR.  I guess I'll have to give up the
84.9 that I'm paying for regular at the Shell station in my 'hood' here in
Atlanta.  It's the Quaker conscience haunting me again.
