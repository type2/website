To All:

The splash pan is one of the first things removed from the typical bus, but
it has a function and should be retained.  If your bus is lacking a splash
pan you can make a good replacement simply by pulling a fiberglas copy from
an existing pan.  The existing pan must be sanded, sealed and waxed to
prevent bonding, and your pull should have at least three layers of fabric on
the body, six on the flange.  The nice part is that your fiberglas copy won't
rust or rattle.
