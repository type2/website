Hello all.

I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
fit in my '79 Bust.  If it would fit, is it a bolt up, plug in the Bus FI
stuff and go job or something worse.  The guy says 'Runs well, $250.'  Is
this a good idea or should I invest $250 in the motor I currently have.  I
haven't taken it apart yet to see what's wrong with it.  My compression test
was less than inspiring (0 on 1 and 3, 70 &amp; 110 on 2 and 4) so I'm weighing
my options.

TIA,

Bob J.
