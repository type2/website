Subject: ripped off!

woo boy did I get ripped off.  Assumption was that this place would rebuild
my starter (preventative maintainence) and generator reasonably whilst I 
replace my transaxle.  They charged me $75 each. Don't assume, ask for a
quote.  Those in Waltham, MA don't go to diamond auto.....
