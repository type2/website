&gt; 
&gt; Jerry Garcia, the lead guitarist of the Grateful Dead, has
&gt; died.

Truly depressing! As someone who has seen the Dead a number 
of times, the news is indeed saddening. The world is indeed 
a poorer place for it.

Sorry to clutter up vangon.lenti w/ rec.gdead, but the lines 
between old bus ownership and grateful dead music is a fuzzy 
one for me. I will leave it at that.

My busses already have obligatory dead stickers.
