Subject: Yassir Arafat and VW Vans (F)

I saw in the paper this week that Yassir Arafat's Mercedes got into an
accident. The article buried on the inside section was real brief but
mentioned that the Mercedes got smacked into by a &quot;van.&quot; Accordingly, there
was a momentary confusion and worry that he was being attacked/ambushed. As
the incident was sorted out it was a ordinary collision situation. I was
laughing thinking of the new terrorist organization known as the &quot;VWO&quot; ;)
Talk about getting to know tailgaters! EEK!
