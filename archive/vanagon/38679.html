Subject: Re: CV Circlip removal tool!??!


&gt;I rented a CV clamp tool from my FLAPS, but all I have managed to do is
&gt;Mangle one of the circlips.  Exactly how should i go about removing these
&gt;durned things?   Am I using the wrong tool?

The correct tool is a pair of &quot;backwards&quot; pliers. When you squeeze them,
they open, and they have serrations on the outside instead of the inside of
the jaws. This is also the correct tool for putting the spacers on the
crankshaft. I have no idea where you get a pair of these pliers or I would
have some. ;)

I have got those circlips off using a pair of sharp needlenose pliers
spreading out and a sharp screwdriver lifting up. It takes three hands. It
helps to file the &quot;backs&quot; of the points of the pliers so they can hang on
to the circlip. Cut a notch in them about a sixteenth of an inch down from
the point.
