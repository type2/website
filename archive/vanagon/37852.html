&gt;&gt; &gt;OK, what does NFA 4295 stand for?   &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         Wait wait! I know I know!! &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, April 2 1995. NFA is
&gt;&gt; the song, 4/2/95 is the date the Grateful Dead performed it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Close indeed. The NFA is the song &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, as performed originally by
&gt;Buddy Holly. The 4295 however might be better written as '42-'95, or a memorial
&gt;to the dates that Mr. Garcia graced us with his inspirational presence...

        Tricky!! I am duly impressed! Did anyone else catch this elusive
detail? I didn't bother to check setlists, being so used to seeing the date
formats as such. VERY stealth indeed!

Peace,
