&gt;&gt; Another solution to avoid dunking the engine is to mount a second trailer 

&gt;&gt; hitch on the front.  You get the idea.  A side benefit might be the ease
&gt;&gt; that you can maneuver a trailer this way.
&gt;
&gt;I would be worried about backing the Vanagon up the ramp.  I would think it
&gt;would be much more likely to lose traction.


Yeah, and I'll marry Cindy Crawford.

Do FWD cars backing a trailer into the water, have this problem? If not,
why would a vanagon &quot;fronting&quot; a trailer into the water, have the problem?

P.S. No, that's *not* a Vanagon with schnorkel, and boat on trailer.
