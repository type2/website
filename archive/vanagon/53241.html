        I've seen &quot;The Parts Place&quot; advertise it.  Thier phone # is (810)
373-2300. 
&gt;
&gt;Or possibly an alternate method, other than doing it by &quot;ear&quot; 
&gt;(doesn't seem to work for me).


        When I did mine, I just lined up the three points (the flat on the
cam, the mark on the flywhell, and the hole in the injection pump) the wat
that I showes in the bently book, and it started and ran just fine.

(I do plan to buy the dial tool in the future so thetI can do it right)
