&gt; Sorry for non-VW content:  some kind soul on either the air or
&gt; water list (I assume) saw my plea for a pair of those old-fashioned
&gt; roller skates.  A set arrived in the mail to me yesterday, but with
&gt; no return address, and their note not signed.  It was mailed from
&gt; Auburn, CA.  I'd like to know whom to thank for this gracious deed?  :)
