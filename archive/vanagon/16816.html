Subject: My windshield washer heater gizmo


As reported earlier, I had a 4&quot; length of 1/4&quot; copper tubing soldered to
the side of my rad. To this I connected the windshield washer line in an
effort to create an ice-destroying spray! Well, I completed all of the
connections last night and tried it out today...it doesn't work! the water
doesn't feel at all warm! I guess I should have used a longer bit of
copper tubing. Oh, well. I'll wait until next winter, maybe it'll have
some effect.

Alistair, back to the drawing board
