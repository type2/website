&gt;Bus is in excellent condition.  Engine is a '77 2000cc F.I. with less

&gt;
&gt;New Tires
&gt;Alignment
&gt;Bleed Brakes
&gt;Oil Change 2 days before leaving

My only advice is do all maintainance at least two weeks before the trip.
This gives you a chance to drive the bus, and shake down any
problems that are exposed by, or caused by the maintainance.
As I posted a few days ago. I spent a quite a few very lonely hours
on very remote roads due to &quot;night before the trip&quot; tune ups in which
I installed some subtly defective parts! It had to happen twice before I
clued in;-(
