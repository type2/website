&gt;Both side windows on my van make a squeal when I open them that causes
&gt;people to run from the van with hands to their ears.  Any recommendations
&gt;for lubrication?

if you mean the roll-up/down windows, clean them really well with some
ammonia-based cleaner after scraping them clean with a single-edge razor
blade.

if you mean the sliding windows, try candle wax on the bottom where the
sliding part goes.
