Subject: Installing child car seats in a Vanagon -Reply

Here in Canada our child carseats have an additional tether attached to
the carseat at the top, behind where the child's head would be.  This
adjustable tether is made of seatbelt like material and has a spring-clip on
it which is then fastened to an anchor bolt which is in turn fastened to
the car body (usually a special bolt hole is provided in the shelf behind
the rear seats (under the box of Kleenex)).

The tether keeps the seat from pivoting about the lapbelt and so from
tipping forward.  

The car seats will be held in place on the rear seat with the lap belts.  
What I'm looking for is a good accessible place to put the anchor bolt and
attach the tether.

Thanks again for your help.    Chris.

We just have ours attached with safety belts.  Where are you installing
the seats?

A long, long time ago when faced with the same situation with my '81 I 
attached the anchors using the bolts that hold the middle seat to the 
body.  I seem to recall that I made a small &quot;X&quot; slit in the carpet above 
where the bolts were and then threaded an appropriate (longer) bolt 
through the anchor, through the carpet, and into the welded nut on the 
chassis.
