I have moved all of my web pages from NetBomb to CalWeb.  NetBomb
just got to be too slow to put up with the effort.  I will be
migrating the rest of my internet needs there soon as well.  Please
update your links with the new URL

VW Page: 
http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/vw.html

Barndoor Page: 
http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/barndoor.html

Thanks for your understanding...

Thom
