Subject: CHANGE THE STATS, JOEL, I GOT THE SYNCRO!!!

Yes, you read it here first!  I finally traded in my 1981 (slowly getting to
300,00 mi) diesel Rabbit.  It will forever to me be at 271,968.  It was a
good car to me but between the cracked block, leaking radiator, torn
upholstery, and body and exhaust rust, it was time to move on.  It will be
missed.  But anyway, I got a 1987 Syncro with 135, 000 miles (almost exactly
half the Rabbits) for $5995 at Ryan Ford in Minnetonka, MN.  It is gold with
very little rust, interior is great, just wonder about the middle seat facing
backwards.  Is it supposed to be that way?  Can I turn it around?  Found out
on the way back to work that there is a small power steering leak up in
front, will have to check it out.  Well, have to go and play with my new toy.
