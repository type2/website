Hey there. As someone noticed, I put in a bid on the Double door panel
van on the  auction web page.
Having done so, I decided to find out where it was, and it turns out to
be in Lincoln.
SOoooooooooooo,
I was wondering if there is anyone in that area who might be willing to
go check it out for me? Also, if it checks out ok, then that wonderful
person might be gracious enough to help me line up the purchase, and
transport as well.
Anyway, if anyone could easily do this, I would be really appreciative,

:)
Thanks
Richard
