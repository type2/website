Subject: Re: 87 Synchro CV Boots


&gt; &gt; I changed a boot on my 94 syncro and bought an original boot from my VW 
&gt; &gt; dealer. It was made in an hard glossy kind of plastic. Not all like the 
&gt; &gt; old ones, really soft rubber. I wonder if it is some kind of 
&gt; &gt; polyuretane? I also bought the special pliers to crimp on the steel 
&gt; &gt; clips on the both end on the boot. I can tell you soon if it is better 
&gt; &gt; than the soft ones.

Wow, what fun!  I wonder if they still make TriStar's over there based on the
EV.  It is sorta sad to see that the pickup trucks look like the old US
Rabbit Trucks now.  I sure hate that import duty in the US., wish I could
order a new doublecab... tho' the price would probably make me reconsider.

On the original thread note, I think that all of the Vanagon Syncros had
the stiff white plastic boots (from my sample of one -- good stats!).  I'd
bet my 1986 has original boots -- not much was ever done to it in its
120,000 kilometers by the original two owners that I could see.  My Acura
has rubber boots on the steering CV's (probably neoprene) so this tack wasn't
taken by Honda.  Interesting that the EV Syncros came out with rubber ones.
I wonder if the new EV's (non-syncro) have the stiff plastic or still use
rubber.  Maybe when one of you checks out the '97 Winnebago EV's today...

Just curious.
