Removing the Catalytic Converter can get you into trouble in the future! Some
states REQUIRE it be in full working order to pass inspection. This could be a
problem for you in two ways - first as an owner you may have an expensive
readdition in the future to be legal, second you may not be able to sell your
van to someone else who either is concerned about the environment or who needs
to pass inspection.

&gt; I was concerned about that, but some folks claim even better (cleaner air) 
&gt; results with other exhaust systems.  Have you heard about this at all?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again!

&gt; &gt; This would cause an increase in pollution.  Don't do it!
