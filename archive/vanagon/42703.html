I don't want to drill any holes in my van's body (or my body either for 
that matter), so I was planning on running the support poles vertically to 
the ground. I tried this setup with the A&amp;E awning at an RV store and it 
works fine. You just have to secure the ends of the poles to the ground 
somehow (tent stake) to keep them from getting knocked or blown out from 
under the awning. To keep the awning from sagging, there are two horizontal 
supports running in a V from the roller to the outer corners of the awning.
