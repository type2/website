You can add me to the list of enthusiasts about the cruising qualities of the EV.
Having had the chance to compare the '87 and the EV for almost a year now,
I'd say there's a big difference between them that the differences in HP
cannot explain (105 vs. 109).

 &gt; While the rated hp is around 108, it puts out 170-180 ft-lbs of torque.
 &gt; Thats not far off what the VR6 produces. It is this torque (which is
 &gt; produced at reasonable rpms) that, in my opinion, gives the van the hwy
 &gt; cruising qualities that Bill and Ric enthuise about.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Its been said before but it bears repeating :

 &gt; 	&quot;horsepower sells cars, torque wins races&quot;
