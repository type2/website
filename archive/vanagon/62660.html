     Well my very clean case is back from the machine shop with nearly 
all new bearings, and I'm going to be doing final assembly on my project 
engine tomorrow and am mystified by the location of the crankshaft end 
play shims.  They don't seem to go between the crank and the flywheel and 
the Bentley is a bit vague in the drawings.
     Do they go around the end piece of the crank, behind the oil seal?

     Any help is appreciated.

     Thanks,
