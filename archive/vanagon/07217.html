So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; You really don't need to run the A/C during the winter, or at least
&gt; in the mid 80 and later VWs. If you notice on the heater controls
&gt; there are the three A/C settings and then the upper/lower and
&gt; defrost controls. The order was set on purpose so that everytime
&gt; you use the heater, you turn on the A/C for a few seconds and allow
&gt; the compressor to turn over. 
&gt; 
&gt; All you need to do is to have the compressor spin around everyonce in a
&gt; while in order to keep the seals lubed.

Unless I misunderstood something here, I don't think this is true for
the Vanagon.  I believe the other water-cooled VWs have slide controls
for heating/venting/ac.  But the Vanagons slide controls are only for
heating/venting and a separate pair of dial knobs control the AC.

So you'd have to manually turn it on every once in a while to get
things lubed.
