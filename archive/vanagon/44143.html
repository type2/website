Initial direct reply to:   cp682_at_cleveland.freenet_dot_edu 
failed with &quot;illegal address - my apologies for use of the following
bandwidth, althought it may be of use to all.


Lisa:
The VW engine management (fuel injection and ignition) is Bosch based - and
there are great similarities between the various Bosch systems used  on VWs
and other German manufacturers (BMW, Audi, . . .  )  etc.

One fairly common design across all(?) Bosch based systems is the use of
relays, two of which are critical to the engine's operation.  They are the
&quot;main&quot; relay (ignition and other stuff) and the main fuel pump.  Naturally
these systems use Bosch mfg. relays (little square cubes, about 1&quot; on edge,
older ones have metal caps, newer are plastic).  It is a fairly recognized
occurance among BMW owners/mechanics, that in particular the main and fuel
pump relays age and the contacts become intermittant.  Tracking down problems
such as you describe can frequently wind up, after much effort, frustration,
and expense, to be cured simply by the replacement of these relays.  Because
the problem is often intermittant, you only know you have found the problem
when over a period of time it fails to re-appear.  (I learned the hard way, I
now carry spares for these relays).  Because the relays are fairly inexpensive
items and simple to replace, my suggestion (especially for a 15 year old
system) is to replace at least the main relay (In my BMW it is a unique relay,
the fuel pump relay is similar to others and can be swapped around) and see if
that helps.  Sometimes, banging on the relay &quot;can&quot; housing with a screwdriver
handle can make the problem come and go.
