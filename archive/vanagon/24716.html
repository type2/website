     After 5000 miles, we love ours. It was well worth the effort and
     the nine month search.

     Try for a 90 or 91 if you like things luxe. These years, the Westies
     all came loaded with cruise, electric doodads, heated mirrors, and
     the $2000 alloy wheels.

I am looking to put myself in a newer Van/westy. Hopefully a 89-91 Westy. I
know very little about the newer Waserboxes, and would like some stories
(horror or pleasure) regarding these. Any info on Synchro's would be
appreciated as well.
