head, butt, both arms, and a pair of vise grips, and proly a little 
liquid wrench unda ya'z car.....just to make it easier to shift..:)

helped out the rest of them gears...)

&gt; &gt;        I live in Wooster and work right down the road from LuK. LuK 
&gt; &gt;is a
&gt; &gt;German based clutch manufacturer so the chances of a self adjusting vw
&gt; &gt;clutch are not too remote. If you want, I can check with some friends 
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;work there and let ya know.
