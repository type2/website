My wife.  And I have to admit that I'd take our Honda dealer over our VW
dealer ANY day.  If Honda made a Vanagon-like van, I'd switch tonight!

Bingo!

The U.S. vans are not necessarily better than the VWs.  Certainly they're
not better for EVERYONE's needs.  But the PERCEPTION that they are better
is so nearly universal that the EuroVan is finding extremely few buyers.
