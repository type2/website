Richard,

Good luck on your trip! I hope you get a good Westy and have much fun!

We're not far behind you. We're leaving June 3
for a 4 week trip to the Southwest. We're headed from NC to Santa Fe
and then will tour northern New Mexico, southern Colorado, southern
Utah, northern Arizona and then home. I've spent the last 6 weeks doing 
repairs and
installing toys to make the trip more comfortable. Hopefully I'll get
to read some of your mail before we leave.

Jeff H.
