Subject: Advice needed on '74 Custom Safare


$2000 is an excellent price on a Safare if it's as good as you describe. It
would be an ideal camper for a single person. I do hope all the
specifically-Safare stuff is there because you'll have a hard time
replacing interior parts if anything's missing--Safares are rare.

If it checks out, GET IT!

Somebody on the list (I think David Schwardze) has one, there's a web page
about his. You'll probably hear from him.
