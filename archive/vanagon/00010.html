Subject: Volkswagen Camper Toy!!!

My girlfriend just retrieved something neat from her mothers storage area...


A Volkswagen Camper toy for Barbie style action figures.  Complete with
accessories.  Looks to be about a mid 70's model bus.  Comes with a table,
frying pan, pot, stool, stove, ice chest, spoon, spatula, coffee pot,
lantern, cups, pick fork, and shovel.  The van has a sliding side door, and
a sunroof (so you could get Ken/Barbie into the drivers seat).

This thing was made by Empire and comes with hippie flower decals on the
side.  She has it almost complete with the box.  

Has anyone else seen anything like this???  Is it worth anything???

Cheers

Hank
