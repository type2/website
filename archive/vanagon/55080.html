Subject: Re: Vanagon Engine Alternatives

&gt;For some time, I have been looking for alternatives to the wasserboxer engine
&gt;in my '85 Westie. 

You could try an Audi 5 cyl.  I know Helmut is doing this conversion.
Helmut has convinced me that when I total my Audi 5000 turbo, I should put the
engine into my van. It would be nice having a turbocharged engine that you'd
never have to do head gaskets on, back there.


Well, I'm off to run my Audi into a tree.
