&quot;I think '75s also had the collapsable spare, maybe they have a silver
socket too? Sami, are you listening?&quot;

Uh? Yes?... Oooh, THAT silver socket?!? Yes, you're absolutely right, my
75 Westy also had the collapsible tire under the left cabinet, although a
previous owner replaced it with a normal tire and mounted it in front. I
don't have the pump, but it is also shown in the owner's camper
manual/pamphlet - I think (will double-check).

Why not simply use a regular cigarette lighter adaptor? I guess that's
because the bus (at least the 75) had no cigarette lighter in the first
place. Is this also true for the 80-82 vanagons David (Carment) mentioned?

I'm actually surprised to hear that a vanagon also has this contraption:
don't you already have a full-sized spare mounted under the front?
