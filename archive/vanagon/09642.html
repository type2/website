   So what is it we want to DO in March.  Wildflowers, birds, hiking .. or

   This, plus the driving time/distance should pretty well dictate where
   we go.

   DVNP can be simply amazing during flower season.  It's ~7 hours from the
   soggy sac.  (Sacramento)  If we're not afraid of a few dirt roads the
   encampment at Saline Valley is dandy.  It's a clothing optional warm 
   springs that has been extensively modified for livability mostly under
   the auspices of the SPA (Saline Valley Preservation Assn).  Warm showers
   can be provided by the ubiquitous Solar Shower/curtain over the rear
   door methodology that has worked flawlessly in the past.    

   Anza-Borrego SP is a bit more of a hoof in miles but better driving.

   Pinnacles NM near Hollister is flowery in the spring.

   For the fellow who thought of Whitney Portal or somewhere in the Owens
   Valley, most of this stuff is BLM (read YOUR land) and if we treat it 
   kindly we can camp most anywhere we like.  I did Whitney several Marches
   ago on the 22d.  It was a winter ascent with lots of step cutting, you
   probably wouldn't like it.

   So let's think of what to do and then where to do it.  One of the basics
   should be that we can handle ~20 assorted loaves/bricks in some sort of
   campsite arrangement.  

   Grover Hot Spgs state park is also an option.  It's in Markleeville,
   tucked out of the way of most of the teeming throngs but only half an
   hour from S. Lake Tahoe for those who do that stuff.  Skiing, both XC
   and Alpine is available within a short drive.  It has the showers etc
   and the accompanying price.  It's not clothing optional.

   For me, late Feb early March is prime powdermowing for Utah's Wasatch
   but I could fit in a flowers trip to celebrate the imminent demise of
   winter.  

   There is a BLM campsite at Pleasant Valley Reservoir near Bishop that 
   offers fine trout fishing, access to Mammoth Mountain, Devils Postpile,
   and Erik Schats Bakery.  There's a KMart in Bishop for the inveterate
   early season Xmas shoppers, easy access to the Ancient Bristlecone Pine
   forest if the road is open (iffy in March).

   If driving is the issue, then the Eastern Sierras are probably out.

   Sam Taylor Park, Sam Mc Donald Park, Big Basin, the usual state beaches
   up and down the coast are always available.  By March the falls are full
   and Yosemite can be astoundingly beautiful before the tour-busses start
   disgorging their procine contents into the meadows.

   over to you martha (the skiing was nice on friday last)
