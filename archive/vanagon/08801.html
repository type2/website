&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Steve for the wonderful...and ongoing...and ongoing ...toast!

You're very welcome!

&gt; 
&gt; Its a good thing you weren't actually toasting while writing that..
&gt; or you would be flat out on the floor by now...or is that how
&gt; the people overthere at your place of employment designed the
&gt; Pentium??? &lt;had to get that dig in..  ;-) &gt;

I keep suggesting some type of drinking establishment on the premises,
but they just won't listen.... ;)

&gt; Anyway, if you liked my '56 stories...stay tuned for (or at least
&gt; on Vintag) the &quot;79 (80)&quot; Cabriolet stories...

Oh yeah, I'll be readin' your updates.  Between you and Thom and
some other's, one of these days I'd like to start a project.  By
the time I can get to it though, there won't be anymore vintage
beasties left. :(

&gt; I highly recommend this to all of you Old Farts out there who
&gt; had Vans back in those &quot;good ole&quot; days....
&gt; 

Yeah, it happens to me when I get a dose of Jimi, or Steppenwolf
on the radio when I'm crusin' sometimes.   

Get your motor runnin'......

Steven
