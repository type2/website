Subject: High-resistance ignition wires

[stevie_at_tekgen.BV.TEK.COM has a rich-running bus w/ ignition probs]

Hi Stevie,

Obviously, that high-resistance coil wire will make your VW run
really badly (and the spark plugs might even look like it's been
running rich).  A 1.5 ohm primary coil is close to OK, but it's
easy to check your coil for sure.  Once you have a good coil
wire in place, you can look at a spark while it's running.  With
the engine off, ground a spare plug (maybe clamp it to the case
lightly with a pair of vice grips, taking care not to mash
threads or crack the insulator) and hook it up to an ignition
wire that you've temporarily borrowed from its real plug.  Start
the engine (yeah, it'll run rough since one of the real plugs
isn't firing...)  then look for a fat, bright blue spark instead
of a thin, yellow, or dim one.  (Well, with Bosch Platinums
you'll always get thin, which might be why my '72 hates 'em.)

You could also just pull off an ignition wire and hold the metal
end a quarter inch or so from a ground and look at the spark
that way.  Even though it's lots quicker, it seems messier and I
can never hold still enough to get a consistent spark and look
at it at the same time.

No doubt you already know this, but you should always use
insulated tools when you're messing with running ignition wires,
in case one of them should have a leak.

Good Luck!
Dennis
