&gt; I've noticed a seemingly extreme number of the EV's I've seen around here 
&gt; (remembering that I live in EV heaven) are outfitted for whellchair 
&gt; passengers and drivers.  Usually MV's but not always.  Haven't noticed a 
&gt; similar phenomenon in other VW vans (particularly I haven't such equiped 
&gt; Vanagons at all).

the Medi-Van fleet modifies all their vanagons for wheel chair access, each van 
in their fleet having a lift and anchor points added.  others may have 
more accurate info on this but there is something about the vanagon 
structure that allows them to meet some DOT requirement for wheel 
chair transport without a lot of costly modification.  additionally, 
their headroom is adequate without the roof extension added to the US 
products.  it is interesting that the EV appears to also meet these 
requirements and is being modified.

Kevin Disse, Detroit Lakes, and I will be having lunch together 
today... he'll know the details.  (and he was the original poster to 
this thread re: accessibility)
