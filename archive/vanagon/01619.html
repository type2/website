&gt; &gt;The VW mechanic I take by Golf and Vanagon to strongly recommends repacking
&gt; &gt;all CV joints every 30,000 miles, especially for the Vanagon.  He claims the
&gt; &gt;joints will last almost indefinitely when maintained at this interval,
&gt; &gt;providing a boot does not tear in the interim.
&gt; 
&gt; sounds good to me. that fits right in with the two-year cycle of replacing
&gt; all the fluids. but why does he say 'especially for the Vanagon'?? why not
&gt; all buses? Inquiring Minds want to know! ;)

&quot;Especially for the Vanagon&quot; was relative to my Golf.  I'm sure he meant
all tranporter models since he was telling me that he had just fininshed
the job on his '68 panel bus.  As we all know the buses experience a healthy
amount of side-to-side rocking motion which adds additional wear and tear 
on the CV joints.  Driving home from work a couple of weeks ago I drove into
some cross winds that damn near blew me off the road.  That ol' Vanagon was
rocking and rolling all of the way home.
