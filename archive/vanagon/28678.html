Dang, It sounds like the ultimate &quot;Resto from Hell&quot; Too bad, Sorry to hear it.

I also heard a preacher once give a sermon which included the tale of the
couple that were high school sweethearts, raised a family, active in church,
loved every one, every one loved them, yadda, yadda. Near retirement time
with the family gone etc., they saved bucks to get the Honda Goldwing that
they always wanted. Retirement came and they got the bike. Everyone gathered
to wish them well on their &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; roadtrip. Birds were
chirping and whatever. The couple (supposedly) were blazing down the road
when a on-coming semitruck on the other side of the divided highway lost a
wheel. It (supposedly) rolled toward them and zipped across the center
median area and popped up right in front of them. Instant moosh and Grams
and Pops were toast! The moral was basically &quot;Whatever/whenever/be ready&quot; I
guess &quot;Don't leave home without it&quot; would also have been appropriate.
Probably another urban folk tale intended to bum people out and convert
souls. Point taken...

I often look at the '57 Single and think of the bit about &quot;this too shall
turn to rust.&quot; As with myself, I also think that if it starts in the morning
and makes it home then all will be cool.
