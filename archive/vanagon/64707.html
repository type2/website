Subject:      Shrinking parts

Is anyone else experiencing shinking plastic trim pieces on their Westfalia
interiors.  It seems that around all the openings and the edges of the
tables and stove/sink covers the edging is slowly getting smaller exposing
the plywood.  I was wondering if it is from heat or is time the enemy?  Is
there anything that can be done to slow the process, or can this material be
replaced?  Just trying to keep it looking new for as long as possible.

Thanks,
Doug
