&gt;&gt; The switch to Aqualon has solved that problem.  Aqualon is a 2 ply
&gt;&gt;textured polyester duck fabric, coated with a PVC resin.  Unlike
&gt;&gt;laminated vinyl,
&gt;&gt; Aqualon won't separate, crack or peel.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Aqualon has been used by the marine industry for boat tops and covers
&gt;&gt; for many years.  It has proven to be durable, stretch and shrink
&gt;&gt; resistant, color fast, stain resistant and water repellent.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The only concern I have with this stuff is, as with all plastics/polyesters is
&gt;what am I exposed to as it outgasses?  As it heats up, and if I'm laying down
&gt;in the upper bunk, well I be breath some toxic fumes, eh?

And I also wonder about how breathable and heavy this stuff might be. Might
make it pretty clammy inside &amp; difficult to open the pop-top.

My plan - when I need to replace the canvas - is to use one of those
high-tech breathable tent nylons now available (there's even a fabric store
here in Seattle that sells them), using the old canvas as a pattern. I'll
probably add screened side windows ala the Eurovan pop top as well.

Up here in the PNW, it's so common to get the canvas wet camping, and then
not get a dry day to pop the top for another week or more, that mildew is a
real problem no matter how careful you are. Waterproof nylon would pretty
much solve this problem as it would dry out in the course of a half hour
sun break. It'd also keep you dryer in the top bunk when it's really foul
outside, as the wet canvas will leak like a sieve if anything touches it
(arm, sleeping bag) on the inside.
