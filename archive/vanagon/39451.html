Steve

The pilot bearing on a type IV lives in the crank. Except if it's a Porsche
914, then it lives in the flywheel. (Different trans, shorter input shaft).

BTW on Variants (whatever you callem, _real_ type IVs, the input shaft can
pull out of the box from the front. Check out a manual on removing the
engine from one of these. Dunno if you can get a new shaft in there after
you pulled the old one out :-) A bus would most probably be different.

But you have a V6. The pilot could be anywhere...
