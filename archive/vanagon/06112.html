&gt; Hi, van' fans,
&gt;  
&gt; I stopped at a local VW place to get filters &amp; we got to talking. It seems that
&gt; one of the guys as a kind of pop top which is full size, looks like the Westy
&gt; top, but does not hinge. It rises straight up. The cool thing is that the top
&gt; was designed as a dealer conversion for the Transporter and does not need the
&gt; body modifications (reinforcements) that the archives mention. He says that the
&gt; only change is a hole nibbled in the roof.
&gt;  
&gt; Does anybody out there have one of these? The shop guy said there were a lot of
&gt; these done out in CA. He does not know the name. I just got back from the shop,
&gt; and if youse all don't say that it sucks, I'll probably take a look at it maybe
&gt; next week.
&gt;  
&gt; The shop guy also has some camper interiors that he sort of wants to clear out.
&gt; What would be a reasonable offer for the stove/sink/fridge stuff? What should I
&gt; be careful of? I know I won't be able to test the fridge before buying.
&gt;  
&gt; (OK, OF what should I be careful?)
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks a lot!

I believe that was called a Riveria top.  My friend has one on a rotten 
bus, and is going to install it on his good bus, Also, a friend from indy 
has one.  There seems to be a nice bed up thre and the ventallation seems 
to be nicer than the westy due to all 4 sides having screns
