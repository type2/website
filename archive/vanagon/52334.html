&gt; The grease you're looking for is Molybdendium DiSuphide. It's black in color

&gt; that's moly based. Go to your local auto parts store and ask for a tube of
&gt; moly grease, it works here.

IMHO 
I would be very surprised if just any Molybdendium DiSuphide would do in
a CV application. There are real forces at work in there and the cost
consequence of using an inferior product just isn't worth the risk.
Barring using the $$ VW stuff, use FLAP's Molybdendium DiSuphide
designated for CV joints preferably CV Moly specified for truck or farm
equipment.
