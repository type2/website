  I'm gathering up the parts to install the rebuilt engine that I will pick
  up next week. I've ordered carb parts and rebuild kits as well as a new
  fuel pump from RMMW and I'm thinking about installing one of the aftermarket
  electronic ignition gizmos that replace the points. Does anyone have a
  recommendation or experience with one of these? Pertronics and Compufire
  are both brands that are advertised frequently in the VW T&amp;A magazines and
  I have also seen products by Allison and Crane Cams. Some manufactuers use
  a magnetic based triggering while others use light emitting and sensing
  diodes. I know some of the list members have considerable electronics 
  expertise, can you suggest a preferred technology?

  I'm thinking about doing this so as to help the engine stay timed correctly.
  I have a hunch that correct engine timing has a lot to do with keeping
  the engine temperature under control and, if so, the $50 or $60 dollars
  that these units cost is a good investment in getting long life &lt;and my
  money's worth&gt; out of my fresh engine. Advice? Comments, Please?A


  Dave
