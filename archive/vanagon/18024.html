Subject: San Diego loss

	Ok- I'm up for a collection for the former owner of that Vanagon,
call it a random act of kindness or a senseless act of mercy. Someone
can take the collection and pass it on or whatever. Let me know.

	And Steve, yeah, insurance will pay for some of it, but heck,
why not do something nice for someone?

	One of my great cheap pleasures in the Bay area is paying for
the person crossing the toll bridge behind me. Costs $1 everywhere except
the Golden Gate, and I figure, no-one is having *so* good a day that
having someone else pay their bridge toll doesn't make it better! If I have
one or more passengers, they can enjoy the body language of the 
recipient too. :-)

	Course, I don't hang around to exchange waves or whatever-
that might be mis-interpreted as creepy.

	Of course the best people to do this for are families on
long trips- I always look for a car with a couple adults and some
kids, especially if it has out of state plates. Wouldn't it brighten
your day, after 400 miles of family driving, to have someone else
pick up the brige toll? I haven't yet had it done for me, but I'm
not counting on that.

	Bill
