Subject: Re: Vanagon engine number?

&gt; 
&gt; Dear list,
&gt; 
&gt; Some guy phoned me up yesterday as a mutal friend told him
&gt; I had some spare 1600 dp heads, which he thinks he needs to
&gt; replace his cracked ones. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now I haven't seen his '80 Vanagon, but apparently it has 'CT' 
&gt; stamped on the engine. Surely this means it is a type 4 (maybe 2 litre?)
&gt; motor. Or have I got it wrong? 
&gt; 
&gt; cheers
&gt; Marcus

	Acording to my database I can inform you that
	the CT Engine = :

		1584 CC.
		37 KiloWatt.
		50 DIN HP.
		Used in May '79 &gt; December '82 Transporter/Vanagon.

	It is basically a Type I case with a flat cooling shroud made
	out of steel.

	I'm not 100% sure, but these heads have the longer plugthreads,
	so look out for the good stuff when shopping for new ones.

	Have a nice day :)  Brian.
