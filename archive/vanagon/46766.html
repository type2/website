Subject: T4 filter, emissions

	When I owned a type IV (914) it had a different filter than
the Rabbit I also owned... shorter and wider, as I recall. 

	Steven,
	Yes, on all counts. I run bone stock, or as close as I
can get for simplicity too. With a VW, the serious hod-rod-head
could just keep a smog motor to swap in every two years... :)

	Bill
