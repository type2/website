Subject: EGR for aircooled vanagon
Date: Wed, 6 Mar 96 8:19:33 PST

I just read a posting that implied that an aircooled vanagon operating without
EGR would overheat and fail prematurely.  Is this true?  I recently purchased a
1980 vanagon (if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it) and
the previous owner removed the EGR.  If this is potentially fatal I want to 
know and restore the EGR.  

In the event that it is critical to have EGR, does anyone have a suggestion on
how to get the parts?  I don't know what I am looking for.  Recommendations for
a knowledgeable used (?) parts dealer who could walk me through the required
pieces over the phone?

On a related subject:  The vanagon's exhaust system is rotting out.  
Suprisingly, it did pass emissions testing, but the system leaks and I'm sure
the Cat. is shot.  I have heard that exhaust components are very expensive so
I went to my local dealer to establish a worst case price.  I intended then to
shop around and see if I couldn't do better.

Well, I don't know the proper names for all the exhaust components.  But the 
large manifold-like piece which joins the exhaust headers from both sides of 
the engine and also has a an integral U-shaped pipe (which folds the exhaust
back into the Cat.) is no longer available from the dealer.  VW does not stock
this part any longer;  At least, according to my local dealer.  The other items
(Cat., muffler, and tail pipe) appear to still be available.

Now the issues:
1) I need to be emissions compliant.  If I cannot obtain the original exhaust
   system is it OK to use the &quot;European&quot; exhaust system.  It is my present
   understanding that the European exhaust system is illegal because it does
   not have a Cat. and is not EPA approved.  Ultimately I suppose I will have
   to take this up with the local EPA office, but any insight/comments would
   be appreciated.  [I have observed the European exhaust for sale thru Parts
   Place.  The ad represents my total knowledge of this exhaust system.]

2) If I were to use the European exhaust system, would it have the proper
   connections for the EGR?

3) If I want to restore the original exhaust system, any suggestions on where
   I might find the &quot;no-longer-available&quot; part?
