Subject: Re: height question (still, somemore)

Tobin, Michael Ketterhagen, Infamous Bob, and others have been discussing
clearence and parking structures. Granted that I am mathmatically retarded,
;) I know that there is a difference between having a 6'8&quot; vehicle and a 7'
clearence. Seems like roughly 2&quot;. Now add in misc. variances in the true
height that the totally sober, really caring, totally attentive pipefitters
and concrete workers applied their materials and skills. Are we talking MIL
specs here? I doubt it. Even if these hard working folks were the greatest
craftsm.. er ah PERSONS, there will be some tolerences in the materials.
Even if these low hanging sprinkler pipes and concrete floors were perfectly
true over the entire parking garage, what happens when a 6'8&quot; vehicle that
is the length of any generation of bus starts up a ramp that has a 7'
clearence right at the base of it? This trick is what happened with the
hoops on the single cab. It appears that the length of the vehicle and the
angle of the incline have funny

influences on the outcome!                         |-------------------------
