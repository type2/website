&gt;&gt; flannel.  Lots of flannel.  Like Martha.  ;)

&gt;You don't get frostbitten in Chicago walking 300 yards dressed in a t-shirt
&gt;and shorts -- it's only 2 blocks.  Ask the Canadians about cold.  They'll
&gt;laugh us out of the place.
&gt;On the other hand, if you're as old as Joel, it might take you a while to
&gt;walk 300 yards.  &lt;Big grin&gt;.

hardy-har-har-har. but that's ok. i WUZ dressed properly: long johns, blue
jeans, suit pants, t-shirt, sweat-shirt, dress shirt, with a suit coat, and
tie, covered with my eskimo parka (complete with fur-lined hood), and two
pair of wool socks, boots, and rubber overshoes, and fur-lined gloves.

BUT!! that left my eyeballs and nose still available to the -60 wind chill.
to me, THAT is a danger of frostbite. especially since most of the yo-yos
at work (who were chicago natives) HAD frostbite in various places.

so Bleah! if THEY can get it and THEY are supposed to know better, then *I*
ain't taking any chances. so there. phuft! :P

i'll just wait on one of you sweat-gland-deprived eskimos to come down here
... and watch as you pass out from heat exhaustion in only 95 degrees. :)
(those folks in chicago were really bitching about three whole days of 90+
weather ... and us southern boys hadn't even started to sweat!)

joel
and our mosquitos are much smaller, too!
