Subject: Buses on the Blue Ridge II


Just a reminder to everyone that Friday May 31 thru Sunday June 2 the 
Appalachian Split Screens, a NC NEATO chapter, will be hosting Buses 
on the Blue Ridge II.  It is held at Mt. Pisgah campground on the 
Blue Ridge Parkway just outside Asheville, NC.  It was a really nice 
gathering last year and I highly recommend it.  Call Neil Pickett at 
(704) 665-1650 for more details.

There is a link to a site with the map in the Coming Events area of 
the NEATO web page at:  http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html

If anyone wants to caravan from the Atlanta area, we will be leaving 
here Friday at lunch.

Dave
