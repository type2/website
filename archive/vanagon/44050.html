Subject: Buses for sale


My Body Man From Hell (tm VanBondo) finally finished the welding of 
my '64 21 window and now it's time for paint.  That means I need to 
sell a couple of buses to regain some ca$h and yard space so I can 
get it into the garage for re-assembly.  Up on the block are:

1969 Westy poptop camper.  Really nice interior, Fresh rebuilt 1600 
AB single port with zero miles, some dents and dings in the right 
rear corner.  $1450 w/engine, $850 w/o

1966 Westy walk-thru hardtop camper.  Nice SO-42 interior, Fresh 
rebuilt 1600 H single port with zero miles, a few dents and dings, 
cut wheel wells, air scoops, rebuilt front wheel cylinders w/new 
seals, new rear wheel cylinders.  $1350 w/engine, $750 w/o

1965 Kombi bench seat.  VERY funky bus.  Someone went to the trouble 
of putting brown shag carpet on EVERY surface of the interior!  Even 
the back of the headlight buckets!  Fresh rebuilt 1600 H single port 
with zero miles, Dent in roof from tree limb fall, rusty rockers, 
rebuilt front wheel cylinders w/new seals, new rear wheel cylinders.  
$1250 w/engine, $650 w/o

All buses are in Marietta, GA and will be at the 4th Annual Georgia 
Vintage VW show in Acworth, GA this Saturday.  For more info on the
