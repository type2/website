Once again we urge you to let the list members know what part of the
country you live in.  Here in California, San Diego, there are several
very nice Vanagons for sale. I found a 100k, 86 Syncro a few weeks ago
and it may still be for sale. This is a well maintained vehicle. I love
looking for Vanagons, so if anyone wants me to check out a vehicle for
them, let me know.
