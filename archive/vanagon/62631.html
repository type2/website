Thanks to everyone the seals are back on the camper, and the luggage rack
is bolted back on the top!  The seals I ordered from The Bus Depot fit
great.  I took the hold down hardware off of the luggage rack, cleaned and
painted it, then replaced the hardware with new rivets.  A little weather
strip &quot;goop&quot; held the bolts at the rear in place until I could reattach the
luggage rack.  Now on to the main job of repairing or replacing the engine.
