Subject: Still Being Screwed...aka--Don't Use PartsPlace

hey now,

the saga continues...i just called partsplace and now am told they don't have
the axle assemblies in stock. i still haven't received a refund of the $260
they have of mine...the local vw parts places dont' have the parts. i can't
order from another outfit cuz i don't have the money. i'm screwed.

i won't get the money back until they receive the parts. i'm considering
getting in touch with the BBB and have talked to the bank about possible fraud
when they overbilled me when the guy on the phone knew perfectly well i wanted
one and not two axle assemblies.

meanwhile my van sits in the backyard with a newly done wax job just waiting
to be driven. have a feeling i won't be going anywhere next weekend either.

anyone in the raleigh, nc area have a sparte axle assembly for a '74 bus,
standard drive? this is all i'm missing to be on the road. i'm so pissed at
this whole situation...makes me wonder why i bought a vw. :-( have had the van
for almost 4 weeks now and driven it only once around the block.
