&gt; i have 4 cooper 205\75 tires on my 73 westy. they are 4 ply, regular car
&gt; tires. like 'em a lot so far...(10000 miles).

I have 205's also, and before that I had 215's on the back of my 73 on
the stock wheels, and they were great.  These are all 70 series.  Once
again let me put in a plug for HR rated tires.  The extremely stiff
sidewalls make my bus handle better than it ever did on regular
passenger car tires (Like the Michelin 195/70SR14's I used to run).
