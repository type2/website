&gt; schedule-- liable to be anywhere in the Hill's (love that kind of 
&gt; vacation).  Join us for a cold one.

Well Shucks, Dan,
	GNATT will be in the Black Hills area from May 31st to June 3rd!
Surely you were aware of that?  :) :)  As this trip gets down to the wire,
I will be posting a list of specific meeting points where people wishing
to meet up with GNATT can be assured to find us.  Times too.
