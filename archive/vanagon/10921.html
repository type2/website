&gt; This is more-or-less related to the original post.  I just bought a Sears
&gt; 36mm, 12pt socket to attack the gland nut on my engine.  I'd rather have
&gt; a 6pt, but Sears doesn't have one.  Will I screw up the nut with the 12pt
&gt; socket?

Probably not, as long as it is a tight fit.  TIP: All impact-wrench sockets
I have seen are 6-point.  You might look for one of those instead if the
socket is not a tight fit.
