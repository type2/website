Look at:

http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm for a review of a diesel
syncro - I cannot find the year in the text...

Also, another link on the page takes you to off-road_dot_com's home page which
	used to have a report of their test of a 16&quot; diesel package... If
	you poke around a little more, you might find it in their archives
	if they have one...
