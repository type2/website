&gt; &gt;Dear Sir,

&gt; &gt;We are pleased to learn that you like to drive the Volkswagen
&gt; &gt;Transporter with Westfalia equipment. On the other hand, we regret
&gt; &gt;that the Winnebago conversion does not meet your requirements.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As you know, offer follows demand and in this case it has been found
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And herein lies the problem with VW in the last 10 years or more, 
IMHO. That kind of logic is what produces 3 trillion H*ndas on our 
roads (and a lot of sad VW lovers...)

&gt; &gt;by marketing experts that there is no strong demand for Westfalia
&gt; &gt;equipment in the US-market. However, the firm Winnebago offers a
Then why did it take me a year to find a decent used Westy, when the 
local VW dealer had Winnies sitting on their lot for up to SIX 
MONTHS??? Some marketing experts they have.

&gt; &gt;conversion for the Volkswagen Transporter in the United States. The
&gt; &gt;equipment they offer is orientated towards customers wishes in your
&gt; &gt;country.                                             ^^^^^^         
Yeh, I guess a few of those trillion H*nda owners must've 
filled out the survey before we got to see it and skewed the results!

Man, I wish we could get a VW rep on this list, but I expect they'll 
say they've already done enough research &amp; know what us loyal VWers 
want even more than we do.....

*&amp;_at_#$*^#$*&amp;#$&amp;!!!!
