&gt; &gt;Well...this could be a number of things.  Who did this rebuild for you?
&gt; 
&gt; I did.  :-(

Oops!  ... Sorry about that.  Obviously I missed that part of your post. 
(sheepish grin here)

&gt; 
&gt; I'll take it back to the shop that did the align-bore and see what they
&gt; think.  Near as I can tell, the sound is from the case, toward the rear.
&gt; Definitely not fan or anything near the heads.  I'll take a stethoscope
&gt; to it tomorrow.  I checked for scraping tin, that's not it.

Well, either way, the engines is comin' out.  I'm afraid the others
are right about the main bearing.
