Dear Dodging Bullets Now,

Syncro (NOT Synchro) is VW's term for their All Wheel Drive systems.  Kinda
like Audi uses Quattro.  VW has made a lot of Syncro models, but only two
have came to the U.S. The 86-88? Quantum Syncro Wagon (which used Audi's
Quattro system) and the 86-91 Vanagon Syncros (including Camper, GL and non
GL versions).  The Vanagons use a viscous coupling to pass power to the front
wheels when needed and optionally came with a rear differential lock which
mechanically locks the right &amp; left rear axles together assuring that they'll
only turn as a pair.

If you'd like to know more you could ask me or Derek Drew - as he is the Most
Enthusiastic Vanagon Syncro Off-Roader! (I think maybe I'm second?)

Sorry, I'm out of bullets today.  No dodging necessary.
