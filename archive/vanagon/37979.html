Subject: red light on-79

The alternator light in my 79 has been on since Saturday.
I've had no choice but t drive the vehicle anyway.
In the meantime, the battery has died twice but i had it recharged both
times.
I just had the voltage regulator checked-they said it was fine, no problems.

Therefore, could the problem be ANYWHERE other than in the alternator?

Thanks, 
Paul
