&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;I am looking to replace the battery in my 82 westy (Helga). Can
&gt;anyone recommend the best ones to buy, and what the dimensions
&gt;need to be to fit under the passenger seat? I use her as my daily
&gt;driver, and take her on road trips at least twice a month. When
&gt;camping, I use the battery for running the stereo, and some
&gt;lights, usually taking the battery to it's limit. So it does get
&gt;drained regularly. Eventually, I would like to go to a two battery
&gt;setup, but just need to find the time.
&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Steve Termecz

The proper large size is a group 41. many air cooled vanagons have been
fitted with a group 42(Beetle, rabbit gas).  The group 41 will start diesels.
