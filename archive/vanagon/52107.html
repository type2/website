Subject: Re: Snow Traction Devices?

Drew mentioned going to 15&quot; wheels and bigger tires, so I thought I'd
post a bit of a warning.  I have 215-75x15 tires on my Kombi -- not huge,
but OK.  I cannot fit tire chains on the rear tires, although they fit
fine on the fronts (and California closes the roads before they require
four wheel drive to wear chains), and I'd rather chain up the fronts anyway.

Big tires on a 2wd, though, will cause problems with chains. The trailing arm
of the rear suspension on a Vanagon is very close to the tire even with
the standard tires.  If you live in a place (like I do) where chains are
often *required* (the cops give tickets here) then you probably want to go
back to little tires in the winter.
