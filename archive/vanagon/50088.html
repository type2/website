Nope, never been on Car Talk.  Too busy squeezing the dogs in the SVX and
driving to the Lake with saliva all over the windows!!  (The Lake is Priest
Lake in N Idaho, a beautiful, crystal-clear mountain lake).  

But now, for the three months I have Kermit the Westy back (and if I decide
to run away), I can let the dogs lie down in luxury on well-upholstered green
plaid beds!!
