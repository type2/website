Tell the truth. My brother-in-law didn't report a speeding ticket because
he thought it had elapsed and was promptly denied insurance.

Btw, I just called USAA and asked about the RV discount. According to
their policy, VW busses are considered regular vehicles. The customer
representative even tried to switch the policy to &quot;motorhome&quot;, but the
computer refused.

And finally, this insurance thread reminds me: I had just moved to the US
when I bought the '75 Westy 5 years ago. As a fer'ner without prior
insurance history or credit record in this God-blessed country, I was
denied insurance by all major insurers. Finally, I found a little outfit
in East Oakland that agreed to sell me liability insurance for about $100
(!) a month. Well, to add insult to injury, a couple weeks later, the
mother company sent me a letter *cancelling* the insurance, because &quot;it is
their policy not to cover VW busses.&quot; Seriously.

Sami ('75 Westf.)
