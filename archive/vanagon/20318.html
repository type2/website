Subject: next camp gathering! (Calif.)


I just received notification in the mail (it's a little late, I know,
but I'm still interested) about the Volksfest '95 up at Lakeport, CA,
near Clearlake on the weekend of July 21-23.  This event is a function
of the Vintage Volkswagen Club of Northern CA, and is supposed to be one
of the best community supported VW events held in the US.  They
even offer camping sites ($12 per day), which I believe are
on Clear Lake.  There are also RV parks, and motel rooms,
of course.  On Friday evening, there's outdoor concerts and other
family activities; Sat, VW-related activities including a Main Street
Show-Off, and that evening, Formula-Vee and Slalom racing
for VW's only.  Sunday is the Main Show and Swap Event at
the fairgrounds, starting at 7am with an all-you-can-eat
greakfast for $3.50.  There's 34+ VW
show classes, and I intend to seriously check out the VW Things, which
will also be displaying there.

Anyway, I was thinking this might be a good date excuse for another
famous vanagon camping trip.  I plan on going.  Anyone else interested?

For more info, the event organizer is John Ryan at 1.707.998.9353

The event is held rain or shine, and a portion of the proceeds go
to the Hospice of Lake County.  All drivers must provide prrof
of insurance to participate in the slalom.

Let me know ASAP!
