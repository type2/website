Subject: New vacuum hoses

VWers,

After searching for some time I could not distinguish where all the
vacuum leaks were coming from.  Therefore I decided to replace all
the hoses.  I already replaced the fuel lines so this seems to be a
logical continuation.

It took about three hours to pull all the old stuff off.  I pulled
the intake manifolds off too and the nuts were really easy to turn.
I wonder if I may have had a leak at the head also.  The last
mechanic was real busy plugging vacuum hoses!  The decel valve hose
to the &quot;S&quot; hose and the fast idle valve hose were plugged.

I could not find the correct hose for the air distributor, decel,
valve, or the crankcase breather.  I used domestic hosed for these.
A 3/4&quot; L preformed heater hose worked great for the breather.  I also
found a preformed hose to use for the decel valve.  It was a 3/4&quot;
heater hose also and was very close.  I ended up cutting it in two
and splicing it together again so it would fit without any twisting.
The air distributor hose came from a domestic radiator hose too.  The
domestic hose is not the right size so I used hose clamps everywhere.
It took about 6hrs to collect all the parts.  If anyone is interested
in the part numbers for the preformed hoses I can provide them.  Just
don't have them with me now.

The first time I reassembled the brake booster line I used too much
rtv on the hard hoses and ended up plugging the line.  It ran much
better though and the idle went down about 200rpm.  There must have
been some severe leakage for the idle to drop even tough I opened up
the decel and fast idle hoses.  Also the bus used to sputter and pop
on deceleration in any gear.  That all went away.

I also took some weather stripping and sealed up around the A/C
compressor, duct taped the heat riser holes shut, and made grommets
around the fresh air tubing and oil filler neck.  It seemed to make
a huge difference in engine compartment temperature.  I suppose the
vacuum leaks were making the engine run hot too.
This phase of the operation took me about 8 hours.

The next morning I redid the brake booster line and have power assist
back.  The engine is still running better than ever although I notice
a few pops and sputters on deceleration again.  I'll have to check
the booster out.

All told it took about 17 hours and US$75 to replace all the vacuum
hoses, new manifold gaskets, lock washers, many hose clamps, spark
plugs, and 2 spark plug seals.
