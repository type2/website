The book calls for &quot;reinforced sidewalls&quot;. If you are dissatisfied I
would go back and talk to the manager. How does it ride? I remember my
dad's 72 datsun pickup came with six ply tires. The ride was harsh as
hell.It was so bad my little sister would get car sickness every time she
rode in it.

&gt;My '82 westy (just bought it, I'm new to this game) had 175R14 radials

&gt;it and needed new rubber.  The 'tire store guy' said that there were
&gt;certain tires designed for westys (I had heard this before) and they 
&gt;were
&gt;8-ply (didn't know what the difference was) so I said &quot;Sure, put them 
&gt;on.&quot; 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Then a friend explains that 8-ply tires destroy suspensions (ndough).  
&gt;Have
&gt;I made a huge blunder?
