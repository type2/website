So Pete Sellers says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm confused and curious ...
&gt; 
&gt; I need some information from out there.
&gt; 
&gt; Can any of you explain the purpose or logic of a message from Derek Drew 
&gt; (about custom trailer hitches) being completely re-transmitted to me as a 
&gt; message from SJohnson?

&gt; 
&gt; 

I do believe you recieved (accidentally) a message that was supposed to be e-mailed
by either me or derek.  Unfortunately one of us forwarded or replyed to the mailing
list instead of our respective personal email addresses.

Sorry for the confusion.
