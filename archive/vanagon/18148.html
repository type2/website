Some time ago I read about plans to convert a beetle to an RV. Well I
have some snapshots showing two conversions. One is showing a
conversion in Hillsboro OR and the other is somewhere in central
Oregon. These are pretty cute, The only original sheetmetal is the nose
and windshield. Everything aft is camper skin. One RV is shown with a
retired couple in front of it and the other is just the RV. They are
tall enough to allow for a camper type door to walk through; replacing
the standard door.

I would be glad to mail these pictures to somenone that is able to
bring them up on the Web.

Steve
