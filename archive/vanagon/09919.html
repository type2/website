Subject: OXY SENSOR LITE ON






&gt;After my recent rebuild, now my red Oxy sensor lite is on.
&gt;How do I turn it off?

Look under the drivers side  wheel well.  There is a black box where one end of
the speedo cable is attached. On this box is a button that can be pushed in to
reset the O2 light.
