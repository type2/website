&gt;Hi all,
&gt;The 7/28/97 issue of AutoWeek has the following news article about a future
&gt;SUV from VW....I mean Audi.....I mean Porsche.....Read for yourself:

&gt;My comments:
&gt;First, it seems quite odd that Porsche would consider a vehicle in its lineup
&gt;that would be sourced from VW, especially something as small &amp; &quot;economy
&gt;minded&quot; as a Golf derivitive.  I would think that Porsce would be interested
&gt;in competing with the likes of Range Rovers, Lexus LX450s, and the new
&gt;Mercedes M-Class.  Go figer...

Remember the 'Porsche' 914 with the VW Vanagon engine ? - &amp; the VW dealers
would then have the audacity to tell prospective buyers that they were
getting a Porsche engine in the Vanagon (made me want to puke).
