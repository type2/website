Subject: FS: '72 Westy in Pa for $850

This camper is for sale locally (Pottstown, Pa., between Phila. and 
Reading) by someone I know. It is not my camper, PLEASE CONTACT THE 
OWNER DIRECTLY.  He does not have e-mail, but his phone number is 
(610) 327-0926. 
The owner is a German fellow, a long-time air-cooled Volkswagen 
mechanic. I saw the camper on his front lawn when I stopped by to 
ask for some free mechanical advice (the best kind, if the advisor 
knows what he's talking about!), and took a quick look at it. He 
says the motor is in great shape, and although I have not heard it 
run I believe him (I have seen him work, and he is a very thorough 
mechanic.) Both rocker panels are rusted out, and the rust below 
the sliding door must be repaired before the door will open 
properly. Also, I recall that the mattress behind the sofabed was 
missing. The camper interior didn't look too bad. The body was 
generally straight, but had a few primer spots. This is not a 
perfect bus by any means, but for $850 (and possibly negotiable) it 
is apparantly a strong running one.
