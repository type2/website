&gt;This type of regulators are available in RV store near me for under $25Cdn. 
&gt;Made by same US company as makes the &quot;OEM&quot;.
&gt;$87 indeed, harumph

Yeah, I'ved used those &quot;cheapie&quot; regulators on my Westy.  Speaking from
experience they are not the same, at least in quality.  About $15 here in the
US and yes made by the same company.  But they're pieces of JUNK and I could
never get them to last more than a summer's use out of 'em.  In doing these
research for the exact replacement relay 3 years ago, I discovered that the
OE company made several DIFFERENT Part Numbered Regulators that all looked
the same, sometimes even functioned the same with varying degrees of quality.
 I wanted the EXACT regulator that Volkswagen sells and the info needed was
not easy to obtain (specs, etc.).  And yes I wanted to know why some
regulators cost anywhere from ten bucks to up over a hundred bucks and why
Volkswagen &amp; Westfalia chose this particular one (I'm a nosy guy and a
stickler for as good or better quality than VW).  Actually the &quot;square&quot;
regulator is really rectangle in shape.  I coulda stocked the CHEAPIES and
sold them to repeat customers every year or offer a quality product ya can
buy once and forget it for the next ten years.  But then the CHEAPIE could
last a few years too - Itsa crapshoot.  You can harumph at $15 ($25Cdn) or my
price or even the outrageous $97.15 at US VW Dealers all ya want - ya get
what ya pay for.  Of my annual sales of these, it seems I sell more of these
to Canadian Westy Owners than US Owners.  You guys must treat yer stuff
pretty rough up there.

Oh, BTW, I did make an error in pricing.  I looked at the wrong part number
in the book - price should be $69.95.  Both Euro American RV (the company
that bought out Delta Six's inventory,) and Bus Boys carries the proper OE
Regulator.
