&gt; UHhhhh   -- sorry folks.  By definition,  dielectric grease is a
&gt; non-conducting material (at least for direct current and any &quot;low&quot; frequency
&gt; alternating currents).
&gt; 
&gt; harvey.
&gt; 
&gt; 
Exactly, as I meant when I posted about using it on electrical
connections.  I will note though, dad got some stuff once from
AT&amp;T designed to put on heavy duty fuse terminals in their power
room.  This stuff was conductive by design, and I've seen
it out there in parts stores now and then.  Maybe somebody got
some by error.  Dielectrics are certainly non-conductors, even
I can remember that from a couple of EE classes, capacitors and
all seperated by dielectric material.
