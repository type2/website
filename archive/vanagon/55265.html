Subject: trying some new timing settings...

I have been having problems with steady idle, intermittent, and 
usually after the van has been running at high speed for at least 30 
minutes.  At idle, the van will rev up to around 1400--1600 RPM and 
then drop down to normal, slowly rise again and then drop back down.

I replaced the coolant temperature switch for the ECU, and this 
seemed to fix the problem for a week or so, only to have the 
condition return.

I have generally set my timing a little bit advanced (I think this is 
advanced--mark to the LEFT of the engine seam).  I tried setting the mark at the 
seam for a few days and the van seemed be unusually sluggish and the 
idle problem was much worse.  I tried setting the timing last weekend 
back to the left again, only a bit further.  Idle problems have 
completely disappeared--idle is much steadier than even the times 
when the condition was less apparent.  The van is noticeably more 
powerful--especially on the low end, but also maintains 70 (and even 
higher) on the freeway very willingly.

Side benefit is also the first time my van has EVER reached 21MPG in 
urban cycle driving.

So what are the nasty side effects of timing my van this way?  Maybe 
the pulley is marked improperly?

BTW, I filled out a brochure request on the Passat web site for the new 
European mode--the book showed up at the office 
today--looks really nice, especially interested in the new 110HP TDI 
engine.
