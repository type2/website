&gt; &gt; That's because oil is not used to cool, it is used to lubricate.

&gt; Oh but it does cool!  At least in the air-cooled engines.  It's
&gt; a very important function, at least if you believe what the books
&gt; say...

I did not say that it doesn't cool, I said that it wasn't used specifically
for cooling.  Lubrication is it's main function.  How could it not help but
remove heat from the engine!  Hell, you could run blood through your
engine and it would remove heat from the engine too.  You should not
however rely on it to keep your engine cool.  It could be masking
a major problem!
