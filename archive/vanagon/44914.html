 (Btw, I just read in Muir that the ideal oil temp is between 180 and
 220F and that temps above 225F should be avoided. Dunno if they knew
 about synthetic oils when they wrote this, however.)
 
 I'd like to thank John Anderson, Paul (pwies_at_loyola), Unca' Joel,
 BusBoy Jim, and Dennis Haynes for their kind replies.

Although the synthetics are probably stable to 400+F, it is not a good thing
to run it there.  Even at 280, things are too hot.  Not counting the oil,
nothing else is designed to get that hot, especially the seals and gaskets.
 Believe it or not,  I have seen Waterboxer Vanagons get the oil that hot,
even with normal water temps.  The big factor in heating the oil is speed and
load.
