&gt;
&gt;I'm sure I speak for all when I say I'd like to see some shots of your
&gt;V6nagon.  Maybe some engine shots as well along with how you have your
&gt;radiator hooked up.   I know you have mentioned your Vanagon in the past
&gt;but it just really didn't home til I read you post about the wiring
&gt;diagrams as to just how neat of a conversion this would be to see.  Slater!



I just started a Web Page, but it doesn't have a real URL address yet,
nor any photos. I'm a HTML neophyte, and haven't quite figured out
how to link to the photos.

BTW, did you know that http://www.lookup_dot_com will give you a FREE web
page, with 100K space (enough for a small-to-medium GIF, I think)?
Why do I get the feeling they will eventually start charging, once they
have you hooked?

Not affiliated with them, just a surprised user.
