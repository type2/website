&gt; I can, price a first or second year Audi V8 now days, or a 200 Quattro
&gt; of similar vintage, course Audi is cursed with this problem in nearly
&gt; everything, nearly 10 years after some idiot ran her kid through the
&gt; garage wall with the accelerator slammed to the floor.
&gt; 
A blessing in a way, for those of us with the VW &quot;karma&quot;, or just 
smart enough not to believe 60 minutes...
I was seriously tempted last fall by an Audi 90 Quattro fully loaded, 
1991 model, 80k, for only $12k on a dealer lot. Hard to believe, 
since it was around $45k only 4 years earlier. I test drove it in the 
rain (hard to find around here... ;)), *amazing traction. Regardless of original 
price, it's a lot of car for $12k. But the Westy's more fun... ;)
