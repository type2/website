Subject: RE: List Stickers


I have a request to make if a second batch of list stickers are to be =
made. Can they be made with a white as opposed to chrome background?

Two reasons:

1. If the sticker is supposed to look like one of those &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; =
country identifier sticker...then they all have white background..

2. The MAIN reason......I have had a couple of opportunities to follow =
my EV while my wife was driving it. Once during the late afternoon, and =
later that evening. Both occasions when either the sun hit the sticker, =
or my headlights, the sticker basically reflected the light and washed =
out.

Anyway....its just a thought.
