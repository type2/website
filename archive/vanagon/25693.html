Subject: Re: 71 Westy and Door Handles


&gt;&gt;As I remember, the spring we're talking about looks like a winding spring
&gt;&gt;you would find in an old clock.  Does anyone have the specs on that spring
&gt;&gt;so I can just buy a couple and put them in at my liesure?  In my case, the
&gt;&gt;springs aren't broken, just worn out and not doing their job of returning
&gt;&gt;the push button in the door handle.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Guys, professional locksmiths do this rebuilding/keying a dozen times
&gt;a day, every day. And they don't even charge much, it's so simple for
&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;Do yourself a favor, and let a pro handle this task! It'll free you up to
&gt;do the shift lever adjustment, seal the pop top, rebuild the engine, etc.!
&gt;

Well so much for the &quot;do it yourself&quot; spirit! ;-)  

It's really not lock rebuilding that's the issue here.  The lock barrel
breaks over time as a result of trying to force the worn/broken spring into
action.  We're not talking about the tumbler springs in the lock barrel or
the small spring in the handle button.  The spring that gives the trouble is
part of the lock release mechanism mounted on the door itself.   

I would recommend modifing the tumblers on a spare lock barrel to fit your
key if yours ever breaks.  It is easy to do and it will save you some spare
change to help buy that pop top seal or parts for the engine!!
