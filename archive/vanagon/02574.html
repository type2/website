&gt; oh yeah that was me - i didnt worry too much gas-tygon compat. because i
&gt; aint got no steeking gas - its an oil burner Vanagon !!

&gt; 
&gt; actually the lines dont see much in the way of fuel - only when the beast is
&gt; tipped one way or the other. Still, after all the work of dropping the tank
&gt; i wouldnt want to kill the job by cheaping out on the wrong hoses ...

Based on Steve's advice, I sucessfully REATTACHED my fuel tank. It took two
people to lift it up and in. The narrow hoses which go to the overflow tanks
need to connected to the tank *before* you push the tank back up. They
will be anyway because you will disconnect them from the overflow tanks
when you take the tank out.

The sending-unit wire is long enough to reach the tank on the ground. 
There is enough room to attach the other hoses to the top of the tank
by sticking your hand up there and feeling around.

I have been talking about planning on buying a plane in a few years,
of which my wife wants nothing to do with. Lately, I have been
pointing out how similar looking light-plane engines are to VW
air-cooled.

Last night's breakthrough was: &quot;If you buy a plane, I want a Convertible
Bug to appease me&quot;.
