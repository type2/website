&gt;&gt;Your coolant light will blink if you do not have the proper mix of
&gt;&gt;coolant and water.  It will also blink if your fluid level is low.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just a thought.

&gt;The sensor is simply a level sensor, not a magical glycol sniffer.

 The level sensor &quot;senses&quot; coolant level , not with a float/ switch
arrangement, but with two metal probes . When coolant level falls below
these probes for about ten seconds conductivity is lost and the LED
flashes and the gauge pegs. Using a decade-resistance box I found that
our 85 reacts this way at over 150,000 ohms between the terminals of the
sensors plug. I can see how this conductivity could be affected by high
anti-freeze (i.e. low H2O ) ratios. 
&quot;What if I live in a cold clime and needed a higher ratio than the sensor
will tolerate?&quot; you exclaim!? I would try an external resistor in
parallel to the sensor. I would start with about a 300k ohm. This would
lower the overall resistance into the acceptable range but not interfere
with the intended function (hopefully).
Good luck
