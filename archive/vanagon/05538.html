Subject:      non-pop-top campers

for Jim (and anyone else semi-interested in converting their bus to a
non-pop-top camper):

check out these folks. their brochure showed a removable cabinet-setup (so
you could use the bus as a people-hauler during the weekdays).

Country Homes Campers             (408) 441-6280
493 Reynolds Circle               (408) 441-6282 FAX
San Jose, CA  95112               makes camper kits for vanagons/EV,
                                  which can be removed for weekday
                                  people hauling duties. pop-tops also.

and this guy used to make vw campers with fixed high-roofs (but i don't
have any better address or phone):

Adventurewagen
Ft. Bragg, CA.

these folks advertise in Motorhome magazine and show their first conversion
as about a 1966 vw bus. :)

Sportsmobile                      three factories. turn out dodge/ford
no phone listed.                  type vans now, but used to make vw
                                  camper vans. (might still, but don't
                                  show it in ad).
9805L Gray Blvd     425L N. Minnewawa    250L Court
Austin, TX 78758    Clovis, CA 93611     Huntington, IN 46750

the first one (Country Homes) did say in their brochure that they sold the
whole bus, with a pop-top, or just the conversion kits. the other two are
kinda sketchy information, but might be worth following up. at the very
least, you might be able to get copies of their old plans/designs for the
vw buses (?) and make your own. it's a thought.
