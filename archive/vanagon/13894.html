Subject: Re: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

&gt;&gt;I moved just outside L.G. and let me tell you the crime rate is far below
&gt;&gt;that of L.G. I can go to sleep at night and not worry about my stereo being
&gt;&gt;ripped off right out of my VW in my drive way!!
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like Sacarmento!  Sheesh - people have tried twice to steal my
&gt;bus, and stole the taillights last September!
&gt;
&gt;A kid down the street had his '67 stolen, and they _stripped_ it.
&gt;
&gt;BTW - I used to work at the CDF station by Lexinton Resevoir.

Thom, vandalism happens everywhere but I know from people that I talk to and
from different stories that have circulated around VW discussion circles
that Sacramento takes the cake when it comes to VW vandalism.

About 7 years ago I attended the first SOTO meet down at Deer Park in San
Diego.  There were these 3 guys from Sacramento, everyone knew who they were
and knew that they were involved in stealing off of other's cars.  Soon
enough, parts that were being sold in their swap spot turned out to be
stolen parts. They were literally dragged and kicked out of the park.
Sacramento still has that reputation.

BTW - were you at the CDF station during the big Lexinton fires a few years
back?  

Regards,
Brendan
