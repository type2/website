&gt;  I know that sometimes, if your van won't start, (as in nothing at all

&gt; starter in order? I think this occurs as a result of the brushes
&gt; settling away from the contact points, so perhaps just putting in new
&gt; brushes would solve things?

No, No, No!
When you bang on it, it wakes the squirrels up, and then they start 
running around again.
Brushes... Hah!  Squirrels don't brush their hair.
