Gary, don't be pessimistic:

Hallo Gary

Sorry for the delay, but I suddenly had to go on vacation last
week.

Today I was at the VAG dealer opposite of the street, but it
was difficult for them to find this part on the slide. A technician
told me, that this caps are also used at the Eurovan Diesels.
I guess, it will be no problem to get them. I gave them a copy
of your e-mail to have the description and the girl behind the
counter (she have a very good technical knowledge about VW!) will
call me tomorrow.
