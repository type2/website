Subject:      Re: Hesitation/Weird temp readings

Volks,
I've had the common hesitation problem on my 86 westi for some time. Tried
many things, air boxes, various sensors, grounding straps ect, ect, ect.
I changed out a thermostat sensor (one going to the ECU) and it worked fine,
until now, the gauge fluxuates and reads well below the red light now.  Going
up hills the needle goes back to normal (just below, to the left of the red
light) and when I start to level off the needle drops all the way in to the
white zone on the very cool side, this is when I get lots of hesitations and
the Van seems to feel like its running out of gas. Is it a bad thermo sensor
or something else, any solutions?
Thanks in advance.

                                           EM
