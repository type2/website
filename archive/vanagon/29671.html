Subject: Fuel Filler Location

     So Peter Jensen asks:

     &gt; What function does the black rectangular box over the rear marker
     &gt;light serve on the passenger side of the vehicle?

     And Steven says:

     &gt;That's the Canadian location for the the fuel filler cap.


     Hmmm..'cause syncros have a differential up front where the
     2wd vanagons have a fuel tank, they all carry the fuel in the rear,
     thus the filler cap over the rear marker on Harry's syncro.
     Mines got the same thing. The tank is a couple of gallons larger, BTW.

     I did not know that all Canadian vanagons came this way...
