Subject: Re: Why Oregonians can't pump their own gas

Hello-
The other reason I have heard is that it is an employment thing, in 
that it forces stations to employ locals to pump gas.  The only 
problem I have is that I have to stand next to them and watch them 
pump to prevent them from 'topping it off' and messing up the 
overflow tank/vent system.  I have a vent leak that floods the cab 
after a 'top off' with fumes.  One of these days . . .
Since Oregon gas is much cheaper that Calif gas, I can't 
complain . . much.

&gt; &gt;BTW, why in the world can't people in Oregon pump their own gas?
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Weston - 
&gt; It's against State Law.  Apparently they don't think their own citizens are
&gt; smart enough to know how to pump their own gas, i.e.: sticking the nozzle in
&gt; the correct orifice :-).  I'll never forget the first time I had to get gas
&gt; in Oregon - got outa the 67 Deluxe to unlock the gas cap and some teenager
&gt; comes runnin' outa the office yelling &quot;don't pump the gas, it's against state
&gt; law!&quot;.  Funny as hell, as he sliiped and fell on the concrete and I'm there
&gt; wonderin' what's all this sh** about?  Felt like I was about commit a felony
&gt; the way he was acting.
