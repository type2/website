Driving from Huntsville down to Dundas where my parents live we had our
left rear tire blow out at 70 mph on the 400. Amazing thing is we did not
notice until the tire began to shred. CAA came along in 1/2 hour and
helped me remove the nuts and put on th spare. The spare got us back home.

FWIW the rear tires are both Michelin X's 185SR15 C rated tires. Very good
handling but a mess when they blow.....
