Subject: air cooled 2 liter

Greetings - 
     I am putting together a 2 liter air cooled for an 81 vanagon and have
some technical questions. The first, about the heads - those that came with
the van have rectangular exhaust ports - the local machinist much prefers the
older style with oval ports - he says they're less likely to crack or drop
valves - any opinions on this?
     Secondly, the bearing bores are out of spec and although the machinist
works on these often with older VW motors, he says he knows of no place to
get oversized bearings to fit a 2 liter that's been line bored. Since this
seems like standard engine rebuild procedure
I'm surprised! Any help or info would be greatly appreciated. 
                                      Thanks,
                                       Eric Baden
