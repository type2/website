&gt; I saw another message similar to my problem,

Well, here's another one!  I have a 91 Passat that has major
idle/revving when cold and sometimes when warm.  It doesn't seem to be
consistent when warm.  I've nearly piled the thing up in the winter
because of this.  Sometimes it really takes me off guard when coming to
a stoplight, especially on ice!

I took it to my local VW guru who can't seem to isolate the problem.
Another winter is fast approaching!  Suggestions?

Jim

 &gt; My '87 starts and runs
&gt; fine when cold.  While cold, the idle takes a second or two to settledown
&gt; from 1500 to around 950.  If it seems to be a bit high, I can ease out
&gt; the clutch for just a second, and the load will pull it down, where it
&gt; will stay just fine.  Once the engine gets good and warm, the idle starts
&gt; to behave rather odd.  As I downshift when coming up to a light or
&gt; whatever, the engine is forced to around 3000.  As I stop and push in the
&gt; clutch, the idle slows to 1000, then bucks up to around 2800-3000.  If I
&gt; then rev the engine to 3500, it drops down to 1000 for a second then
&gt; bucks righr back up to 2900 again.  If I ease the clutch out, the engine
&gt; just keeps pulling.  I have to sit at lights and either listen to the
&gt; engine freerev at 2900, or use the clutch to keep the idle low
