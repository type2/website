So Dan Houg says:
&gt; The fan for cooling the fridge condensor is really a cheap looking 
&gt; affair.  I'm thinking of replacing or augmenting it with a 12v muffin 
&gt; fan for more air and quieter operation.  Any comments??

Just be sure that the fan you replace the old one with doesn't draw more
current than the old one so that you don't drain the battery.
