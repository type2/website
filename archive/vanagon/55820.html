&gt; the list who have TWICE, under no duress, etc., purchased two of VW's 
&gt; marketing masterpieces....the VW Thing and the EuroVan.

Well masterpieces sure but not of marketting.  Two of the best vehicles 
ever made that couldn't be sold in the US....

&gt; Let's see....I'm guilty....so are Pete Sellers and the Killians....are there 
&gt; others? What other bizzare behavior do we have in common? Hmmmmmm.......

Martha's asked about EV's so she made wise up sooner or later....
