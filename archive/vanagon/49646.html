Subject: water pump report

Thanks to all those who responded to my request seeking advice.  This is 
the first repair I've had someone else do, but I believe I've found a 
good mechanic in Greeley, CO.  He had much knowledge to share and didn't 
mind taking the time to share it.  If he knew anything about computers, I 
think he'd make a good resource for info on our list.  

Regarding the water pump, he recommended that I stay away from the 
western auto rebuild....said they had to many problems even though they 
have lifetime warranty.  He instead installed a GRAF pump which, though 
made in Italy, has english and german on the box.  THe cost was about $98 
for the pump and 2hours labor.  I would have liked to have done the job 
myself, but I live 30 miles from where I work, and I didn't want to drive 
it much more.  Since the owner/mechanic of the shop lives in the same 
town as me, he drove me home when I dropped of the vanagon.  It gave me a 
chance to ask about oil filters and leaky head gaskets.  

ANyway, thanks for the help as ususal.  The engine sounds nice and quiet 
once again, and I'm ready to take it back up to 14000feet.
