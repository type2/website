Subject: Original spec and date of your Splitty

Your chassis and gen info plate does not tell you a lot; but there is a second
plate that will tell you the exact day/date of assembly, the optional extras
(M codes) fitted and the paint and upholstery colours/finish? This info means
you can determine the EXACT date a Split rolled off the,assembly line and how
your van used look.
THis second plate can be found riveted to the bulkhead behind the drivers
seat...unless some nurd removed it in which case your stuck!
This plate has three rows of numbers.
The top row gives the exact day of manufacture
the second row refers to the M list codes and the bottom row deals with market
(all exported to Britain start EN here) and paint and trim codes.
As far as dating goes on pre '63 vans ther is a five figured no eg 08 05 9
indicating the van was built on 8 May 1959. Post '63s have three digits here.
The first two refer to the day and the third digit to the month BUT Jan to
Sept are 1 -9 whilst Oct to Dec are O N and D!
If you are unsure of the year you need to match your chassis no with the
Production schedule - this is a full side of A4 and too much to type!
SSVC and NEATO are hoping to put all this info, including paint codes etc into
a booklet, with a lot of help from our friends in Bulli Kartei! 
Hopefully you can now determine whether a van is late 65'/early 66 or if it
really is 1952 not 1953......
I have a load of stuff about all this and mention it as often the exact spec
and date of a bus is wanted by people - eithr to restore or, as in my case,
just to know its past!
Happy Farghesting........Dave.
