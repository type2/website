Subject: Owner's manuals, kind of

I haven't been on the list long, so please forgive me if you've already 
covered this (I haven't had the time to search all of the archives).

I have a 1973 Campmobile.  Did they have a special supplement for the 
camping equipment?  There are little brackets that I can't figure out what 
to do with!!!

If so, I assume that you can't get them from the dealer, which leaves buying 
used or getting a copy from someone.

Does someone have one that they can copy for me?

Thanks,
Dean Aukes
