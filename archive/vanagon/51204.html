Subject: '82 with '83 paint

Hi Ya'll --

My '82 vanagon came with an '83 paint job -- we didn't realize this until we
went to buy touch-up paint. I don't recall the dealer saying anything about
this when we bought it. Does this sort of thing happen often with VWs? (The
&quot;twin&quot; of mine in town has a windshield wiper on the back window, which mine
is without ...)

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
