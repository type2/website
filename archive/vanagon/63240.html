&lt;&lt; This is only true if you do not have a the rubber bumper strip running the
 lenght of the bumper. The bumper strip makes it impossible to remove the
 bolts without damaging a number of the plastic clips that hold it on.

 The same goes for the front bumper again assuming that there is the two
 rubber strips along the lenght of the bumper &gt;&gt;


not really... I've pried off the rubber trim strips w/ a screwdriver
carefully, and replaced them w/ no problems...
take your time removing the trim strip and you won't break any of the plastic
tabs.
