&gt; brakes&quot;.  A long night with the schematic, and a close examination of the 
&gt; light assembly (which is quite stuffed with circuitry) convinced me this 
&gt; was so.&gt;

 Thanks Steven.  I thought I was going to have to find out why the light 
came on when the parking prake was pulled out on my '78 bus.  I'd never 
seen this before and remembered it came on when the brakes were failing 
on my bug a few years back.  This would have been great for my mom when I 
was growing up.  I remember getting into town and we could see the smoke 
coming off the tires because she left the brake on for the past 5 miles.
You just saved me a couple hours of useless work.  Thanks agian.
