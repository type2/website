Subject: 87  Westfalia - TRANSMISSION

I have a 1987 Westy with a 4-speed gearbox.  Just over the course of a week it has 
developed a high pitched noise in 2nd, 3rd and 4th.  The pitch remains the same,
although the higher the speed the louder the noise. It is only heard when the 
transmission is engaged and the clutch let out.  I would appreciate any &quot;virtual&quot;
advise as I've talked to 1/2 dozen &quot;German&quot; mechanics (here in Southern 
California) who don't even know what VW stands for.  Although a friend has 
suggested a pinion gear.  I'm also interested in hearing from anyone who has 
toyed with the idea of installing a 5-speed.

I've owned this car only 5 months and everything down to the stove is in excellent
shape with only 53,000 miles. Any advise for keeping my new true love in this 
primo shape is also appreciated.

Thanks - Dan
