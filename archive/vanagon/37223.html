Subject: Re: oil burning on new engine


This is bound to date me, but...

 'Normal' oil consumption on the Model -T was 1 quart per 100 miles, partly
burned, partly blown overboard.  

The Model-T was the first true 'People's Car'.  Indeed, it was the standard
example of automotive engineering around the world and improving on the
design of Henry's T-model was one of Ferdinand Porsche's dreams.

Dissimilar piston ring and cylinder wall metals are known to produce high oil
consumption.  In some cases such mis-matches wear faster than normal, in
others they wear more slowly.  Aircraft engines sacrifice some sealing
ability for longer wear, accepting increased oil consumption as part of the
compromise.  Perhaps this was the design philosophy behind the engine in
question.

But in all honesty it seems a step backwards.  The only Diesel engines with
which I have any familiarity are Cumins, which have a very low oil
consumption and regularly achieve service lives of half a million miles or
more.
