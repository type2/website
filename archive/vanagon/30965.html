Well, I've put one full-vehicle up so far (component: vehicle).
However, I think I'd be happier if working vehicles were to go through
this other site.  Thanks for the pointer.

People can make of it what they want.  The gist, as I read Martha's
original message, was for it to be kind of an in-group thing.  I have
no real preference either way.  People are generally going to want
something in return for giving up whatever hunk of metal they've got,
and I don't see any problem with that.  On the other hand, I don't
really want this to turn into a free classified ads thing with
thousands of people sending in new entries every day, either.

At this point, it's a service I'm providing to the list, with as
little editorializing as I can get away with.  We'll see where it
goes, and deal appropriately when the time comes.

This won't go on the page unless you explicitly ask for it to....
