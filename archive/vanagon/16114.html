Subject: Re: DC AREA-Earth day BBQ


&gt;&gt;In honor of Earth day, tomorrow Saturday there will be a festival on the
&gt;&gt;National Mall in Wash-DC with bands and protests and everything that makes
&gt;&gt;DC great.

&gt;&gt;I am having a BBQ for friends at 4pm at 2269 Cathdedral NW. (next to National
&gt;&gt;Zoo)

&gt;&gt;If you are in town and have a van and know how to get there stop on by.

Are Notchbacks invited? I haven't had the time to rebuild my Vanagon tranny.
