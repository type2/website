&gt;the new sensor or will the O2 sensor automatically compensate? and b) the
&gt;hot start problem is still there. It wants to run, and starts fine
&gt;cold but still takes three 8 second cranks of the key before it will
&gt;fire. You mentioned checking the thermo switch and the pressure valve.
&gt;The pump was replaced about 2 years ago. I guess I should check for
&gt;spark first eh? BTW the coil is made in ....wait for
&gt;it...Slovenia..that breakaway state of former Yugoslavia (it is less
&gt;than 6 months old_) but would be my guess if the problem is
&gt;electrical. The idle module is also new as is the high throttle switch.

the o2 sensor tells the computer what your engine is doing and the computer
should auto-compensate. but you might need to get your 'specs' reset to help
the computer not work so hard (i.e., get the idle speed reset).

it's possible you have an old bad coil, but my experience has been that the
coil just flat died. plop. nothing.  i've heard of coils going wacko and
still working, but all of my (that quit) just died outright.

i'd still look at that fuel pressure. or the thermo time switch. it 'sounds'
like you're not getting ANY fuel or too much fuel. like i can really tell
over email. :)
