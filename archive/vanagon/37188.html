&gt;Will the 'modified sine wave output' from the PCxxx series of

&gt;
&gt;specifically, i wish to install a hot water circulating pump into 
&gt;the heating circuit of my wasserboxer for increased heater output.  12v 
&gt;models are available but i could buy a 110v model AND an inverter 
&gt;cheaper than just buying the 12v one.
&gt;
&gt;i have done this with a 12v Par Jabsco 'Centri Puppy' pump and was 
&gt;pleased with the result but the Jabsco pump seal didn't hold up to 
&gt;hot, pressurized anti-freeze.

Good inverters will run a small pump such as a Taco circultor pump.  Be very
careful about using a pump to get more water into the heating system  The
addidtional flow there will cause some part of the engine to starve. You may
not see overheating on the gauge, but you could be creating hot spots in the
engine.  I would try larger coolant hoses to the heater cores and insulating
them may help also.  I really think that the engine water pump should be the
only pump pushing water through the system.  This cooling system and engine
is too delicately balanced to play with it's water flow.
