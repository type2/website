Subject: Re: warranty/heads/gaskets post#2

I just called BBB at 1-800-955-5100. It brought me to a local BBB in Oakland
California. This call resulted in much more positive outcome regarding the
vanagon gasket problem.

Talked to a lady. Apparently the vanagon problem is well known subject that
the lady immediately understands what I was going to ask. She is going to
send me a mediation/arbitration forms, together with informations regarding
the FTC's settlement with VWoA and instructions, etc...

But I do need to provide an estimate of how much it will cost me to repair
the leaking head gasket problem. This is hard for me because the engine has
to be torn apart to determine what needs to be done and the cost of the repair.
If I go to a VW dealer I am wondering if they will examine the engine fairly.
Or if they will just say labor + cost of gasket, even if the heads are warpped
or cracked or need work anyhow. If I go to an independent VW shop I am wondering
if their estimate will be right. They might under estimate the cost by lowering
the price in order to win a business from me.

What do you folks think? How do I get an estimate that will give me best
protection? Dealer? Or else where? How? I think dealer will tear the engine
in order to estimate. But then they could say anything against me.

Any ideas/experience? Please help. Thanks.
