&gt;Still don't know whats wrong, but I'm guessing the injectors are clogged.
&gt;Remove plug wires,
&gt;manifolds, spark plugs.

&gt;Call around about cleaning, or rebuilding injectors, can't find anybody who
&gt;does it.
&gt;Strongly considering slapping the stock carb on and seeing how it runs, and
&gt;how the power brakes behave.  When I get some time.

Err, how much you say you paid for that gas, sound expensive, does he sell 
much???  I've bought bad gas, unfortunately several times in upstate NY, 
just over the Cdn border from us. It wiped out my '85 van really well, 
hesitation on the highway, some bucking, and then a steady drop in power 
with tons of misfiring. I seriously didn't think we would finish the trip. 
Took a long time to clear out at home, I was topping up with Cdn gas as 
often as possible. Try disconnecting your fuel pump intake line and put it 
into a jerrycan of gas you know is good. Water is injected into the 
cylinders to control pre-ignition pinging in over-turbo'd cars, wipes out 
regular engines real well. Chevron Techron gas treatment gets good reviews, 
try that also maybe.   tim s.
