Subject: Burning Buses

Hi,

Unfortunately, saw a mid-70s camper catch on fire this weekend (next to a gas
pump, of all places).  When I inquired, the station attendent said the cause
was that it &quot;backfired.&quot;  

The question:  What is it that makes these buses burn?  Are certain
years/models more prone than others?

THanks, David
