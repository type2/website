&gt;          A note for our Canadian viewers: DON'T EVER BUY a battery from 
&gt; Canadian Tire Corp. They are crap, I had 4 in 18 months, all replaced over 
&gt; the counter. Then I moved 1000 miles, lost the warranty card, and needed yet 
&gt; another battery which they won't give me, under the 24 month free 
&gt; replacement deal. They would like me to &quot;keep your voice down and please 
&gt; leave since we can't help you...&quot; (expletives deleted). Calls to corporate 
&gt; headquarters netted me zero. 
&gt;         tim s.
&gt; 
&gt; 
I concur, I had one blow up in the back of my KG which then caught fire
and spattered acid all over me (ruined my shirt). Fortunately I was able
to douse the flames which were working their way down the carb throat on
the left and near to the fuel line......All this on the 401 just near TO....DC
