Subject: 87 GL digital clock

Hello;  I finally found the time to check out the problem with the digital
clock constantly cycling the hours.  I took out the dash to get at the
clock, the little target-like plastic peices that you push against when you
adjust the clock had fallen doown and got itself trapped under the plunger
(that actuallly does the electrical work that changes the time) I just
re-aligned the little targets, and re-assembled the dash. Everything works.
I had a little problem when I first  bought the van the speedo needle was
lazy, occasionally taking 2 or 3 kms. to bounce off the stop and get busy.
At the time I just took the speedo light out and squirted some WD40 at the
base of the speedo needle with the long hose that came with it, through the
hole the light goes into.  Works great.  I mopped up the mess today when I
had the dash out. The whole job took about an hour.    Larry Carter
