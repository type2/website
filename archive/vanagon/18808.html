So Ric says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;VW should issue paper sacks with 2 eye holes for the EV drivers. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Steve...I understand your parents used to make you wear a paper bag
&gt; over your head whenever you were in close proximity to them, so I
&gt; guess you can speak from experience!  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; BTW....your parents have not sent me the check this month for
&gt; being nice to you!!

Ric,

You're just still upset because your parents had to tie a bone around
your neck to get the dog to play with you!  ;p  ;)
