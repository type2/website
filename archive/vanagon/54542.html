Subject: Re: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling


I bought the harness (it also works on my '86) and couldn't stand not knowing
what it was, so I (carefully) took it apart.  What it is, is an op amp and 
some other misc parts, which together make &quot;an active filter&quot;. (One could 
probably build it for &lt; $10.)  I started generating a schematic, but quit 
because it didn't seem too many people were interested.

 &gt;Thanks for the reply, I bought the harness today and will probably install
 &gt;it the next time I change oil when hopefully the temp here in WI will be
 &gt;above 0.
 &gt;
 &gt;My driveability problems were exactly as described by others who fixed
 &gt;their problem with this wiring harness.  BTW the guy at the parts counter
 &gt;referred to this as a transformer (per the official VW parts fiche) that
 &gt;changes the signal strength--could be I suppose.
