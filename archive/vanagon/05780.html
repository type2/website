Subject: Sound deadening material mentioned in Hot VWs


Hi all,

Yesterday, I received my Dec. issue of Hot VWs and read with interest
the article on page 92 about adding sound deadening material to the
interior of &quot;Project Streetwise&quot; their project VW sedan.

They mention three products made by &quot;Accumat&quot; and give a phone number for
a place called Scosche Industries in CA that is a supplier of this material.
The phone number in the article is wrong and will connect you with a
tee-shirt company! (the wrong number is (800) 621-3695)

I looked up the area code for Moorpark, CA and then directory asistance
gave me the correct phone number which is (805) 523-0687.  If you call
you will be told (by a recording) to send $3 for a catalog to:

    Scosche Industries
    P.O. Box 8099
    Moorpark, CA  93020-8099

They will send a catalog and a certificate worth $3 on your first order.

This is for anyone who is interested, I know nothing about the company
or the product mentioned above except for what I read in the Hot VW's article.
I thought some of you might like to know more about sound deadening and might
have been frustrated by the incorrect phone number in the Hot VWs article.

I'm re-doing the interior of one of my busses right now and am very interested
in making this bus as weather-tight, insulated, and quiet inside as I can.

Cheers,
