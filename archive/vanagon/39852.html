Subject: Re: EV Driver's Ed

&gt;My 16 year old son has now entered the &quot;Learner's Permit&quot; phase of his
&gt;driving career. After getting his feet wet on his grandmonther's
&gt;automatic-equipped Bimmer, it was time to teach him the fine art of driving
&gt;a standard.
&gt;
&gt;My wife's Subaru was chosen for this duty over the EV (my mistake...). For
&gt;the past two weeks the Sub was forced to endure dropped clutches, stalls,
&gt;misshifts....to the point where Erik (my 16 yr old) and I were about to
&gt;throw in the towel as far as standards were concerned....a MAJOR defeat for
&gt;not only him....but me.
&gt;
&gt;So I figured, what the hell, lets take the EV out. We drove to a large
&gt;parking lot....swapped seats...Erik was at the controls....clutch in...brake
&gt;on...start it up...put it in first...let out the clutch...and....
&gt;
&gt;sssssSSSSSSSMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTHHHHH.....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;off we went. Hmmmm...try it again....sssssSSSSSSMMMMMMMOOOOOOOTTTTTTHHHH....

Ric,

Proof that there must be something to that broad torque curve on the 5cyl EV.
