&gt; I have heard of a book called 'How to Rebuild your VW air-cooled
&gt; engine' by Tom Wilson, lemme know if it answers these questions
&gt; and I'll order it :)

Get the book,  'Nuff said...
&gt; 
&gt; - the distributor-end of the crank has some kind of distributor
&gt; gear thing on it that I can't get off.  Do I need to have
&gt; the shop that checks the crank put on the new bearing for me so
&gt; they can press the gear back on?

The shop will remove it for you.  You can reinstall it yourself with
heat and patience.
 
&gt; - is re-assembly something like: put in the crank and cam and
&gt; rods and button up the case, now try to get the cylinders/pistons
&gt; on one by one?  This sounds tough... my new cylinders/pistons are
&gt; already assembled, am I going to be able to get them on without
&gt; re-compressing the rings?  Not enough space there for MY ring
&gt; compressor...

You pull the pistons out of the liners just enough to expose the pin,
then install them.  You don't have to remove the pistons all the way.
Again, get the book...

&gt; - how oh how do you get the piston pins on the connecting rods
&gt; without beating on them and thereby possibly trashing the rod
&gt; bearings?  I know that's how I got 'em off :(  Although I did it
&gt; gently with stuff braced against them...

I used a big C-clamp.  Book says you can also heat up the pistons to do
this.
 
&gt; - do you use permatex or something between case halves?

I used Permatex 3-D Aircraft cement, or whatever it is.  You can't use
just anything - some of them are too thick.  Did I mention you should
get the book?
 
&gt; - there was a lifter which was often noisy; could it have wrecked
&gt; its push rod?  They all look ok, and I never knew which one was
&gt; the noisy one... hopefully it'll be healed when Weber cleans them...

Roll the pushrods on a flat surface to see if they are bent.  If so,
replace them.
