Subject: Re: Source for poptop seal?

Excerpts from mail: 25-Jun-96 Source for poptop seal? by nhogg_at_whoi_dot_edu 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know of a source for a high quality replacement seal for the poptop
&gt; on a 87 Westfalia? I tried JC Whitney's offering but it came in two pieces
&gt; and was distinctly thinner than the oem product.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help, Nelson Hogg
