&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't Maxwell Smart drive up in a Karmen(SP) Ghia during the
&gt;&gt;&gt;opening shot of &quot;Get Smart&quot;?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nope-- that was a Sunbeam Tiger.
&gt;
&gt;No, No, No Steve! You are half correct. Max did drive a Sunbeam Tiger but
&gt;in some episodes or some season &lt; hard to tell in reruns&gt; DID indeed drive 
a
&gt;Ghia Convert.  I noticed this while I owned my long since gone '70 Ghia
&gt;'vert. I still would love to drive either one again.


Oops!  Uh... *never mind*.

My Dad bought a new Alpine in '60, and regretted it once Sunbeam started
stuffing engines larger than the entire car into them. Had an eye for
Tigers ever since, and forgot the Ghia &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
