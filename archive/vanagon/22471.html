Subject: Whatever happened to... (was: Vanagon Power?)



&gt;&gt;Wow, my '84 Vanagon has a hole in the muffler - appears to be the cause of 

&gt;&gt;some backfire problems.  Anyway, are there any alternatives to the 
$800-$900
&gt;&gt;exhaust system?  I don't want to invest more in the pipes than the van is
&gt;&gt;worth.  (DREAMER????????)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This will be your own judgement call. For example, my local Stevens Creek
&gt;VW dealer's repair department constantly have vanagon owners spend $$$ to
&gt;fix their vw's leaking head gaskets. Many times, the $$$ spent is equal to
&gt;or more than the cost of vehicles. People do this because, in the long
&gt;run, it is cheaper than you buy another vehicle and face another set of
&gt;problems. How about a brand new one? It is also your call.

This strikes me as a financial version of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot;... almost.
What a choice to have to make-- spend 3/4 of your vehicle's value to keep
it running, or buy an unknown one which may in the long run hit you harder,
or buy a brand-new one for the sake of haveing VW pay for its upkeep under
warranty.

Remember the upright-fan engine buses (and bugs etc.), where mufflers
cost $40 (and still do), could be replaced with simple hand tools (so could
the entire engine or trans, for that matter), and they didn't HAVE head
gaskets? Or water pumps, radiators, fuel injectors, and so on? Of course,
Federal emmissions regulations were responsible for some of those
&quot;improvements&quot;. But, in short, they were designed to be simple, economical,
and servicable.

It's a sad thing to see an honorable design philosophy die...

Getting time for VW to rename their company, from Volkswagen (people's car)
to maybe CompanyWagen.

Love my '71 bus, but I'll never buy one of those new ones. Who needs
payments PLUS hassles? Not to mention staggering repair bills.

Exit gripe mode-- now reloading human attributes.
