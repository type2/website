Subject: Searching For Westys &amp; Slider Door Parts....

Howdy all!  I am on the prowl for 2 Westys and a sliding door mechanism 
for a 73-79 Bus.  I guess I should elaborate - the Westy search is for 
a couple of friends of mine and I thought I would try the List first!  
The door mechanism is for a neighbor's van who blew the &quot;white metal&quot; 
to pieces when it seized up.  On with the show.... 

Desperately seeking 87-89 Westy, preferrably no Syncros, manual 
transmission, but loaded to the gills with power all and A/C.  Must be 
in hyperclean, showroom-like shape for a somewhat anal retentive owner 
that will mother it to death!  Ahhh, yes, the caveat - the potential 
Westy mustn't have more than 50K on the odometer (yes, that's the first 
time around!).  Any hints, pointers, vehicles?  The gentleman seems to 
be willing to pay a decent price for the &quot;perfect&quot; Westfalia!

Next request - any 80's Westy in pretty darn good shape.  Should be 
reasonably nice mechanically and cosmetically, with good camping 
interior.  This fellow would like to stay between $3500-3900.  Any 
takers, perchance?

Finally, some pieces parts.  A slider door mechanism for a late model 
bay window.  This is the piece attached to the roller &quot;doohingey&quot; that 
cruises along the top or &quot;beltline&quot; track and makes your slider open 
and close happily.  VWoA would like to remove $240.00 for said item!  
Anyone have a junked out Bus or a spare one of these lying around that 
could be had for slightly (okay, a LOT) cheaper?

Well, guess that's it!  If anyone can help out, please email me at the 
above address.  I appreciate the patience and hope this finds the 
Listmembers well and good!  I brought my '73 Sportsmobile out of 
storage on Sunday and we've been transversing the Western New York 
countryside with glee!  See you on the road.....

P.S. - Travelling for the Westys is not out of the question, but I 
would prefer to stay in the approximate &quot;top-right&quot; quadrant of the 
country.  The slider mechanism can come from wherever - it's quite a 
bit easier to ship than a Vanagon!  :-)
