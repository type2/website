&gt; Poor Alyce has been in the shop for 2 days (fuel injection nightmare - another
&gt; story for another day).  The mechanic said part of the reason she ran rough was
&gt; because &quot;the valves tightened up again&quot;.  The valves had just been adjusted 2
&gt; weeks ago (by the same person at the same shop).  Has anyone ever heard of
&gt; valves tightening up like this on their own?  What causes it?

It is usally caused by the valves stretching, and could mean that they are
close to catastrophic failure (dropping).  If your mechanic doesn't know
about this, get a new mechanic.
