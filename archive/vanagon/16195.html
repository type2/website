That's right. Just after powerwashing the undercarriage and the engine
(just from below), the idle went up from 850 to 1200 rpm. Any
explanations? If it matters, the bus is fuel-injected.

PS: Thanks to David C, Tim, and John for your suggestions regarding the
removal of undercoating. They will be helpful. (Home Depot, here I come!!)
