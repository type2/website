Subject:  Clutch Return Spring Broken...



Douglas,

To replace the clutch return spring you must remove the clutch throw-out
lever, the thing the clutch cable goes through.  It is secured with a
snap-ring.  Scurb all of the crud off before you begin.  The thow-out arm has
serrations that matches grooves in the throw-out lever, it will only go
together one way, but if there's a lot of crud it may not want to come off
without a bit of work.

With the throw-out lever removed, clean things up and wriggle the shaft.  Any
play is bad and indicates the bushing is worn.  Obtain a bushing kit and plan
to replace the bushing the next time you do your clutch.  I think the Bentley
has illustrations covering this task which is relatively easy so long as
everything is clean.

There are no mysteries to putting the lever and spring back together but you
may have some difficulty getting the clutch cable through the lever and
threading on the adjuster nut while holding tension on lever and preventing
the cable from turning.  My trick is to use bailing wire around the lever to
the axel or other hard-point to hold the lever in position, allowing me to
use both hands to insert/hold the cable while installing the adjuster nut.

Replace the spring as soon as you can.  It is easier than replacing your
clutch, which is what you'll have to replace if you run too long without
proper return-spring tension.  I'll make this a general post since it applies
to buses as well as bugs.

-Bob
