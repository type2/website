Subject: '88 Wolfsburg Repair or Sell?

In the last year, fuel lines have been replaced, radiator 
reconditioned, new cylinder block and new fuel pump replaced as well as 
clutch. Overheating has caused the stud rod in the engine to break 
loose and now a new or reconditioned engine will need to be installed. 
Should we go ahead with paying $2800 for a new engine or selling now 
before this van breaks us financially?  Van has logged 130,00 miles. If 
we sell, what would be a fair price in its unrunnable state? Thank you 
for any input.
