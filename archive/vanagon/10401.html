Subject: Pacific Northwest gathering.

Well, I've received some positive, absolute, definite, `I might come's' 
from the following people:

Alistair Bell &lt;ui775_at_freenet.victoria.bc_dot_ca&gt;
Bradley &lt;bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com&gt; (It will probably be in WA somewhere, though.)
Will SElf &lt;wself_at_viking.emcmt_dot_edu&gt;
Jerry Hull &lt;HULLJ_at_frl.orst_dot_edu&gt;
Evan Estern &lt;evestern_at_pipeline_dot_com&gt;
Homer Christensen &lt;hchriste_at_linknet.kitsap.lib.wa_dot_us&gt;

And an enthusiastic response from:
Rick Gordon &lt;rickgo_at_halcyon_dot_com&gt;

How does mid/late March sound? Everyone said along the lines of:
`Depends on when it is.', so that will give everyone a time frame
to work with. Probably on a weekend, (Sat/Sun for most people, who
unlike me work at a hospital.) And gives Will some spring to change
his head gaskets. :) And give everyone a chance for some good weather,
hopefully.
