Dual A/C-heat? (Don't think I've seen and MV with out this - but I've 
seen CLs w/o)
CD Changer? (I've never known anyone to have one of these - curious to 
how convinient it really is)

&gt; It ran me 15,800, the dealer has to replace one broken cup holder, and 
&gt; the evaporator canister for the A/C, also got them to throw in a Bentley's.
&gt; It's the best van I've found in the area at the best price.  The next 
&gt; cheapest MV I've found was 17,400 and a GL for 15,700.  If anybody is 
&gt; looking for a Eurovan in FL let me know, I can point you to a few.

Sounds like a pretty good deal. One of cup holders broke and the 
replacement was not identical but looked a little stronger.

&gt; Does anybody know if VW makes a floormat for the rear and how much is cost?

Front and rear floormats for an MV should run about $90 each - not what 
you'd call cheap.  I just ordered mine.  Was going to post when I got 
them.  I recommend them if you have kids I think - better working 
knowledge when I get them. (And I'll put what I paid.  I'm going to 
recommend the dealer publicly.  Priced parts 
at several local dealers and there were much cheaper and more helpful 
than the others - Ray Burnette in Alexandria Virginia.  Got a Class II 
hitch from them and installed it over the weekend.  I'll have to post 
that story - ran into a few 'surprises'.  Lucky I have the hitch since I 
now have to two a Thing home from Pennsylvania (see comments on VintagVW 
and Thing lists)
