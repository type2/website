Isn't it curious that Thom and I both used the word bile in a post on 
the same day?  I had sent mine about minivans before I read his about 
dealers.  Where is Rod Sirling (sp) when you need him?  
&gt; 
&gt; Yup thats what I wanna do:  trade the old 911 for a spankin' new Hundai!
&gt; (sounds of serious retching, coughing up blood and bile)
