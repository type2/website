Subject: ccc's 2/23-25 camp location!


The votes are in, and of those bothering to vote [:)], the results
were unanamous.  Everyone seems to want the lower elevation without
the dirt road, whether Schwarze is able to join us or not.  :)

Anyway, to refresh your memories, here's what David wrote about
this place....

----

Peppermint (I think that's the name)
        Also has no hookups, showers, or flush toilets.  Also has a creek.
This place is near the highway but still not well known, it seems, or
very well organized.  I think they charge a small fee, like $4/night.
The terrain is similar to Long Valley, but I think the elev. is a bit
lower - around 5600 ft?  Might be a little warmer at night.  This place
is on a highway which runs behind (East of) an indian reservation
somewhere East of Visalia.  I brought in a map to give directions but as
luck would have it it was missing this page.  :(  It might be a bit
closer to the Bay area but the road in is a steep, windy mutha.  We
could probably burn stuff here but there will be other people around.
There is likely to be NOBODY else at Long Valley.  One advantage of
Peppermint is that a few miles down the road there is a nice trail,
about 2 miles long leading to a great overlook of the mountains.  There
is a rock outcropping on the side of a mountain with a house built on
top of it.  You can walk up to the house and look out around it with
telescopes.  It is quite spectacular but you have to see it to
understand.  It's used by the rangers as a fire lookout most of the
time.  I guarantee it will be worth the hike.

I move that we accept this as the location, and start concentrating
on how to get there.  DAVE???????????  :)
