Subject: Re: Help with dragging brakes


	Jonny,
	Please don't put grease in your brake cylenders!!
	IF the pistons don't smoothly return, then dump those cylinders
and get new ones. The springs OUGHT to be able to overcome the stiffness
of the rubber boots and seals. Maybe you need new springs. Everything
is clean and shiny, yes? 
	If you absolutely must grease something, put a little anti-sieze
where the spring grabs the shoes, but just a little. You could also put
a TINY ammount on where the star-adjuster holds the shoes. 

	DON'T put any petroleum based anything anywhere near the
rubber boots on the outside of the cylenders. Sure, its good, strong
neoprene rubber, but this is not the place to do chemical experiments.

	Given the difference between new cyclenders and a rebuild kit,
I always put in new these days. If you do rebuild, you really ought
to hone it, and if that seems like too much trouble, then take the
easy way out and buy new! The inside of the cylinder gets rough from
the crud that collects in there over the years, and that roughness
causes dragging, presuming that your springs are strong and everything
else is clean and sound.

	Sorry to sound like such a fuddy-duddy, but I'm VERY conservative
with brakes. I work on cars that people I love drive.

	Bill
