BTW did you know that VW has enetered into an agreement w/ Winnebago
(please say it ain't so, i can see the shag carpet, Corinthian leather etc.
now!!), to make motorhomes based on the Eurovan platform.


&gt;So Al Knoll says:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;Westphalia, anything else is just an RV&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Ah!  But did you know that if your Westy has a bed,
&gt;porta-potty and a sink, that there is a tax write-off
&gt;for it because it is considered an RV!
&gt;
&gt;So, all others are just Minivans.  ;)
