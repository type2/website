Subject: Sierra Propylene Glycol Coolant?

Hi all,
I have a feeling that this one has been answered before, so I'm sorry if I'm
re-hashing old stuff.  
I've noticed that the Sierra brand coolant specifically states on the jug
that it is PHOSPHATE FREE. It is the only coolant I've seen on the store
shelves that makes this claim.  I know that this phosphate free thing is
important (at least VW says so), so the questions become:
1. Can PROPYLENE Glycol be used in a Vanagon instead of of ETHYLENE Glycol?
 2. Does VW have any official stance on this? 
3. Does anyone on the list have any experience with this product?

Thanks in advance for the information.
