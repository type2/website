Get the big Bentley.  It's expensive (~$90) but covers everything you'll 
need to know.  Haynes and the others are good complements to it, but not 
as comprehensive.

I went through the same thing when I got my 81 Westy.  Bought the Muir 
book and quickly found out that it didn't cover the Vanagon series.
