Subject: Stuff with the '77

Thanks for the people that told about how to go about putting in the 
engine seal, and remove the filler tube rubber.

The engine seal was easy.  I'm just used to my '66, it just slides in.  
The only hard part was in the fuel rail area... blah FI.

Getting the hose clamp off of the rubber filler thing was a royal PITA.
I'd say it took me about 2 hour because there wasn't enough room for any 
screwdriver.  And there was hardly enough room for my hand.  I could only 
fit a small phillips bit in the space, but I couldn't turn it.  So I 
fixed it in to a ratcheting screwdriver with a 1/4&quot; ratcheting boxend.  
That got it loose enough that I could almost turn the phillips tip by 
hand.  I hope I never have to do this again.  Someone that wrote me said 
that they did this, and the replacement they got from VW was reinforced 
at the area where the gas pump hits it.  I hope so.

BTW, hacked at the Vanagon a bit more today.  About all I have left to 
remove is the rear suspension.  And then I can dispose of the rest of the 
carcass.  Good thing most of the parts fit in my '72 mobile storage shed.

Bradley
