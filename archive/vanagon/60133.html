&lt;&lt; Hello all,
 
 For anyone who wants to get together prior to the Bug Out, I will be at the
 Bull Run 
 campground site #88 from Fri. 5/23 . If anyone wants to stop by and
 bar-b-q, chew the fat
 or whatever please stop by. It would be good to put faces to some of the
 names on 
 the list. The campground is on route 29 between route 66 and route 234. 
 
 If you plan to stop by either Fri Sat or sunday after the show give me a
 shout.
 
 
 See you there.
  &gt;&gt;

Is the &quot;Bull Run&quot; Campground the closest one to the Old Dominion Speedway?
Anyone know of any other campgrounds nearby that aren't all booked up for
next weekend?  (YES, Manassas is NEXT weekend.....  how time flies...)

Don't think I want to sleep in the Holiday Inn parking lot again.... :&lt;(
