Subject: FS 71 bus San Jose CA area

71 Bus
1600 bug engine
Runs well
fairly ugly..
a mish mash of paint ..
some rust but the body is pretty straight..
good rubber..
stereo..

On to the important stuff:

Currently with a non-operating permit because I just brought it down
from Washington and still didn't get it together before my time limit
ran out (today) from the DMV for registering an out of state car. I
just bought another car and don't have the time to get things going
again or the money to keep 2 cars running.

It has the smoggable equipment on it... I bought distributor, 34 pic 3
carb and dual port manifold like it's supposed to have and replaced
the same- 2 barrel Weber carb, companion air cleaner, smooth intake
manifold and centrifigal advance dist. are waiting for the smog
certification to be reinstalled. In other words, they are sitting in a
box and if you want, you can swap 'em on after you make it California
legal.

Needs clutch throwout bearing, and has some popping out of 4th. Could
be trans. or maybe the after market gear shifter. 

YES IT DOES DRIVE! You're welcome to take a sneaky spin in the
neighborhood with me even thought it's a non-op tag. If you're in the
area, I'll tow it if you buy it and don't want to drive it home 'cause
of the tags.


$500

If interested, email me.
