Subject: FS:87 camper, less than 15k! 

Maybe one of the richer members would be interested.  Auto sport
(802-878-3391) near Burlington Vermont has an 87 full camper with less
than 15K.  It was purchased along with another one for a research
project at univ vt.  According to the seller the camping stuff has never
been touched: the mileage is for real.  He called it a throwback to
1987.  However, he wants more than 13k for the van.
