Subject:       clarification: neato as in cool

The limitations of my experience and the written word strike again.

I meant the workshop manual was interesting, cool etc when I referred 
to it as &quot;Neato&quot;  The was not meant to be an affliation with NEATO 
(aka Bentley).

Thanks to Michael Heron in Toronto for the reminder!
