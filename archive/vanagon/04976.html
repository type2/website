Subject: 6-ply tires???
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 94 13:07:28 PDT

Hi,
	I have been wondering what is meant by &quot;6-ply&quot; tires?  My new
Sears Trailhandler tires say 2+2+2 (the last two being sidewall plies).
Is this a 6-ply tire?  Is it &quot;reinforced&quot;??  The guy at Sears said you add
up ALL the plies to get &quot;6-ply&quot; wheras before I thought that you didn't
count the sidewall plies.

Do I need to go chew out Sears and get my $140 back?  

By the way, my first driving impressions of the tires are not good.  When
I swerve the bus, it feels like the back end is floating on tapioca, and
it is very unstable in crosswinds.

Thanks for any help,
	-David
