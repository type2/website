&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because, he explained, as I drive home from work,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   And I drive at the speed-limit posted,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All the cars on the road zoom by, faster than me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   So the speedo just has to be toasted!
&gt;
&gt;This _really_ happened???

yup. Alternative Garage was the place. car was a Jetta GL. go figure. :)

&gt;you have to wonder if this guy was as clueless as he sounds, or was he
&gt;indulging in a little bit of pompous righteousness, trying to force
&gt;other to declare how &quot;right&quot; he was...

(1) he was definitely clueless.
(2) he was definitely pompous about the speedo being &quot;wrong&quot;!!

&gt;A clue would be, which lane was he in? Fie on you veedubbers who do

the LEFT lane, of course!! silly ... nobody in birmingham drives in the
right lane! :)

&gt;No, my driving is far from perfect. But I try not to get in the way
&gt;TOO much... deliberately using the laws, to mess people up, is

what amazes me is the number of people who get bent out of shape cause you
are in the right lane, doing the speed limit, and slowing THEM down!!! like,
where the hell else am i supposed to be???   i can't drive but one car at
a time, but these clowns think they can drive my car better than i can.

&gt;&gt;and the worst part is that the mechanics took his word that something was
&gt;&gt;wrong without checking first. old Tom spent several hours on that one.
&gt;
&gt;Hope Tom charged the dweeb full rates for the educational value.
&gt;Whether he actually got any was up to him, IMHO.

nope. the owner of the shop let the guy go without charging him anything.
so Tom got shafted for the time. typical auto repair shop: the mechanics do
the work and get screwed.

&gt;Sorry, this is one of my hot buttons. Now resetting... reloading human

huh. best not to get old Tom started on that subject!
