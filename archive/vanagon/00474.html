Subject: Fitting a rack onto the top of a 1991 Westfalia


I'm looking for information on how I'd go about fitting a roof rack (to 
carry a small boat) onto the top of a Vanagon equipped with a pop-top.  
I'd like to be able to attach the rack to the pop-top, so I wouldn't have 
to remove the boat in order to sleep at night.  If anyone has had 
experiences with this set-up, please let me know.

Thanks
