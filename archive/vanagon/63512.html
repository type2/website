Subject: Another Dometic non-cooling update:

My 87 Westy Syncro Dometic always worked on AC &amp; DC, though not well enough
to make ice like one member reported.  But, no matter whos technique I used,
I could not get the propane lit.

2 days ago, I pulled the refrig. as per instuctions found several months ago
on the list and proceeded to vacuum out the dust and cobwebs and inspect all
wires etc.  I could not see anything that could be an obvious problem until I
opened up the combustion chamber...

The burner was covered in rust scale that had fallen from one of the stack
pipes.  I would assume it was from the exhaust stack which also feeds heat to
the system.  In my case, the fallen rust scale prevented the burner from
igniting.  I could imagine that a less severe case rust on the exhaust stack
could insulate the stack and cut cooling performance until it flaked off.

Bottom line:  took about 1 hour to R&amp;R and another 30 minutes to purge the
gas line of air and get the burner lit.

Thanks to all of you on the list for direct and indirect help in bringing my
refrigerator back to life!

Curt Long
