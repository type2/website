Those temps are really normal for that engine if driven at high speeds.  Cure, 
keep engines RPM below 3500 and make sure oil level is not too high.  I keep 
it centered between the marks.  Believe it or not, the Water Boxers can also 
get the oil this hot.

Now that I have a oil temp guage installed, I can prove that I am 
overheating, as opposed to just thinking I am.  I frequently run my 
oil temp up to 250F on hills or stopped in traffic afterwards.  On a 
recent trip I reached 270 for a few miles, yikes!

I went out to attempt to adjust things a little and using the O2 
sensor voltage output as a lean/rich guide, and Bentley as a guide.
Here's what I found:  (BTW, California version '80, O2, but no EGR)

O2 sensor output: undetectable voltage, if any.  This confirms that I 
am running lean?  Or a dead O2 sensor?  I turned the mixture screw 1 
1/2 turns each way with no change to RPM, O2 voltage or anything 
else.  Tried hooking a 1.5 volt AA battery to the O2 sensor lead, no 
effect.  Disconnecting O2 sensor had no affect.  Bentley indicates 
that bad injectors could be a culprit, not spitting out enough fuel?

Reset mixture screw to original position.  Throttle screw is ALL the way 
in, no room for adjustment for lower RPMs, tho the idle RPM is correct.  
Adjusting out 2 turns made no change in RPM.

Sprayed flammable stuff around vacuum lines with no effect noticed,
hoping to find a vacuum leak somewhere.

Now what?
