&gt; Well, along with the cold weather comes strange behavior from the bus! The
&gt; problem isn't serious at all yet, just curious and would like to prevent
&gt; any problems.
&gt; 
&gt; As the subject says, my bus is idling strange, whether warm or cold. It's
&gt; almost like you lightly touch the gas pedal every second or so. The
&gt; rev/idle is very consistent and rhythmic. It doesn't seem to effect the
&gt; drivability at all and doesn't stall when idling for extended periods, say
&gt; 10 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice/comments?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

 Ihave an 83.5 with 70k with the exact same problem.  I have ran all tests
as per Bentley and cannot find anything wrong.  Replaced 02 sensor to no
avail.  Good Luck.
