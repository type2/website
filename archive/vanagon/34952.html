Subject: RE: Re:1974 Bus price

The west coast makes me crazy with its huge selection and low prices for
VW vans.  There should be a federal program to move VW vans inland at
least as far as the Great Divide so that we don't lose them when the
Big Earthquake shakes all the other cars into the Pacific.

Here in New Jersey, any VW van that touches the ground in exactly 
four places is worth $1000 to somebody.
