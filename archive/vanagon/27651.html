 Brad &lt;and other owners of '72-'73 buses&gt;,

 The second switch on your transmission is part of your emission control
 system. The switch is part of circuit that shuts off the ignition's
 vacuum advance when the engine is at part throttle in first thru third
 gears to reduce the production of NOx. The switch is actuated when the
 transmission is placed in fourth gear, restoring vacuum advance. The
 other component of the system is a little gold colored solenoid valve
 with a hose spigot on each end. On my '72, it was mounted to the 
 &quot;ceiling&quot; of the engine compartment to the left of the heater blower.
 The vacuum advance hose from the left carb goes to the front &lt;FIF&gt; of the
 valve and a second hose goes from the back of the valve to the spigot
 that points &quot;up&quot; on the distributor.
