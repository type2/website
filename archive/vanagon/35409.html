John asks...

&gt;I've seen a reference on your page and elsewhere
&gt;to an article in HDB&amp;VW (Hot VW's??) titled &quot;Westfalia Project&quot;. I'd
&gt;like to look through that article and hopefully get some ideas. I'd
&gt;appreciate it if  you would  give me the info on the issue where it
&gt;appeared so I can get a copy.


This is a list of the issues of DB&amp;HVW (it _was_ wrong on my page -- oops -- 
now corrected) that contained the &quot;Westfalia Project&quot;. I called the magazine 
several years ago and was able to get these back issues sent. The woman I 
spoke with knew exactly which ones I needed. 

1. March 1989 Volume 22 Number 3 - page 84 Poptop Revival
2. May 1944 Volume 22 Number 5 - page 44 Bus Gauge Installation
3. June 1989 Volume 22 Number 6 - page 36 &quot;Ripper&quot; motor gets a home
4. July 1989 Volume 22 Number 7 - page 62 Final touches to engine
5. December 1989 Volume 22 Number 12 - page 68 Banging the Bus into shape
6. January 1990 Volume 23 Number 3 - page 68 Interior Revival
7. February 1990 Volume 23 Number 3 - page 52 Sound Installation Ideas
8. March 1990 Volume 23 Number 3 - page 84 Handling Improvements
9. April 1991 Volume 24 Number 3 - page 77 Project Westfalia Update, one year 
later

I will also post this list on my page for future reference.
