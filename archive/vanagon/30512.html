Subject: Which carbs.?

Right now we have a single weber setup and we get 10-15mpg with 
moderate performance.  We want to move up to dual carbs and so we are 
wondering how well the Kadrons will do.  These are around $260.  If 
not those, then how are Webers and Dellortos ($460).

Also, does anyone know of an electric water pump that can withstand 
prolonged exposure to high temperatures (around 200*F)? 

Thanks to everyone for all the help we have already received!
