Subject: Re: vanagon.list group trip!


I'd be interested if something can be done in the Northeast. ....
according to the latest LiMBO rag there's going to be another
bus show at Ben &amp; Jerry's in VT on August 13....howabout it?

We could all meet there...and then sneak over to the factory for
free ice cream....and down the road to the VT coffee place and
get free caffeen!!!

I went to the June VW show there and there were a ton of Typ 2s...
unfortunately I was the only vanagon.list type there...

There's camping available not to far away, and lots of neat stuff
to see and do in the area (Stowe, etc...)
