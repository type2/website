and it's too bad we don't have all the equipment to send/receive pictures on
this thing yet. the cover story on this issue is a bunch of buses getting
together in Vermont ... looks like about 20 campers all together with their
tops popped! kinda neat looking! :)

and i see bill kennedy's article about his favorite subject: Porsche 6-cyl.
in a vanagon! ;)

all the news that fits, we print.
