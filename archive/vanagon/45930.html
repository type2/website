So Thomas Czerniak says:
&gt; The only way that I have found to get to the front fan and core is to remove 
&gt; the unit which is of course impossible without removing the dash itself. It is 
&gt; a big job ,not too difficult, just tedious. Especially around the steering 
&gt; colunm mounting points. I had the same problem on an 84 vanagon that I pickd 
&gt; up for cheap. Once out ,the heater box has to be opened by removing the clips 
&gt; that hold the housing halves together.At that point lube the fan bearings 
&gt; liberally. It should solve the problem. before you put the unit back under the 
I'm not sure I'd want to use a fan that was trying to tell you that it's
having trouble already, IMHO.  The fan motor is not necessarily telling
you that it need lubrication.  It may be telling you that the bearings
are worn and should be replaced.  And if that's the case, I'd not want
to have to tear apart the dash again because the fan motor fails again.
