&gt;&gt;As for gelcoating, I wonder how this differs from paint. Is it harder or less
&gt;&gt;resistant to fading or more waterproof or something. What is the deal with
&gt;&gt;gelcoat. Why don't we paint our cars with it if it is so good?

&gt;Gelcoat is a special coating put on the fiberglass that must be anaerobically
&gt;cured.  It can then be painted like any other fiberglass part.  Most of
&gt;the fiberglass parts you buy aftermarkety are gel coated.

One of the main advantages of Gelcoating something is that the paint is mixed
into the Gelcoat solution itself.  In my past experience anyway.  Also this is
in my opinion the only way to go for repairing exterior fiberglas, as far as a
long term solution anyway.
