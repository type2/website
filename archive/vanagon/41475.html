Subject: Industrial motors

I saw my first VW industrial engine this weekend.  It was from the early
'70s and had a crank-start pulley bolt.  Cool!  Other interesting features
were the magneto (Genuine VW made by vertex in switzerland) , the fanshroud
(no ports for the heater tubes and neat &quot;Volkswagen Industrial Engines&quot;
sticker) and the exhaust (two two-into-one pipes that exited straight up
into the area normally occupied by dual carbs--looked stock)

Anyone got more info on these?

-Tom
