Subject: Contacts for VDO Gauges


I am looking for the following gauges senders, and hardware to monitor the, 
Oil Pressure, Coolant Temperature, and Alternator Output (preferably in 
Amps), and maybe Fuel Pressure on a 1989 Waterboxer Westy.  Any contacts or 
advise on how to proceed? VDO is $$$, but I would prefer quality and 
something that matches the stock gauges.

Thanks,

Pete
