&gt;&gt; 1) What is a reasonable price for buying such a vehicle from a yard? This is
&gt;&gt; separate from whether the guy'll actually sell it. I know that in WI there is
&gt;&gt; a title transfer option for junked vehicles.
&gt;
&gt;Here in California, I have asked about this several times, and have always
&gt;been told that once a vehicle has been &quot;salvaged&quot;, there is no legal way of
&gt;ever registering it again.  Such a shame, too, because there are so many

It _is_ possible to re-register a car after a salvage title has been taken 
out on it.  Shops do it all the time.  The buy a car that the insurance 
company has written off and junked, cut and paste it back together, and sell
it.  I would not want to buy one of these abortions, but they do it all 
the time and its perfectly legal.

I know a guy who tried to get a Austin Healey convertible out of a junkyard,
and they didn't want to even talk to him.  This poor car was actually in
nice shape, but he though the tranny was gone.  There was no collision 
damage and nobody had bothered to take any parts off of it.  I think the
junkyard people just don't want to bother.
