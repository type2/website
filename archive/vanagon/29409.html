Taking this a very different direction from the 'physically challenged' bit.

I've noticed a seemingly extreme number of the EV's I've seen around here 
(remembering that I live in EV heaven) are outfitted for whellchair 
passengers and drivers.  Usually MV's but not always.  Haven't noticed a 
similar phenomenon in other VW vans (particularly I haven't such equiped 
Vanagons at all).

&gt; My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?

&gt; Guess I'll need to refer to my '71 loaf, with its questionable 1600

&gt; Heater doesn't work, either... &quot;climactically challenged&quot;?
&gt; Steering's pretty loose, too... &quot;directionally unimpaired&quot;?

&gt; Anyone else?
