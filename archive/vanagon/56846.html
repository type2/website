&gt; Forget the VR6 EV, forget the Land Rovers, forget the Sharans, just get your-
&gt; selves a nice cheap '93 w/ a dead motor and start hanging out at wrecking yards
&gt; waiting for one of them TDI motors to come in...   ;)

forget that.  Get a Syncro Westie, and &quot;start hanging out at wrecking yards
waiting for one of the&quot; PORSCHE BOXSTER motors to come in! &quot;Whoa-ness&quot;.

The muffler alone looks like a $5k part -- what a beaut!
