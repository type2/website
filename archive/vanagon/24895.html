&gt;           Well, Bradley ...being over 6'2 1/2&quot; I tried driving a splitie
&gt;           but I got tired of bending down to see or mistaking the metal 
&gt;           piece in the middle for a tree in the road. No, I like my view
&gt; unobstructed and panoramic...not looking through a porthole.

Well... the Vanagon has a really good view.  A nice bis rear view mirror, 
and large rear window.  And the windshield reminds me of the veiwing area 
at the airport, because it's so large.  

I have the same problem with the split window bus.  I'm 6', and I can only 
guess that Germans in the '50s and '60s were about 5' tall.  And they're 
a bit harder to see out the rear window, but mine is better than the pre 
'64 buses.  But the split window bus is still way cool!
