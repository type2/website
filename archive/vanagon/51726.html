&gt; Greetings, all.  Indeed I pay so much more I get sick writing the numbers
&gt; down.  Because I have two young men----I pay $5000 per year for three
&gt; vehicles with me (old lady psychiatrist) and two lads 19 and 21 both of whom
&gt; love to speed and don't mind getting tickets (actually each only 1 ticket
&gt; every 18 months or so, not too bad considering their ages).  78 VW Westy, 84
&gt; Volvo DL and 92 Subaru SVX.  $800 each car.
&gt; 
&gt; So--------count yerselves lucky!!  Enjoy all your money!!

  &quot; People who have childern should pay for there children.&quot;
