Subject: USA number for Eastwood?

	Folks,
	Someone was kind enough to send me the Canadian 800 number for
Eastwood Canada, but I can't use it from California. 800 directory assistance
didn't have a number for Eastwood that resulted in a car parts and accessories
place, so I'm stuck. I shouldn't have recycled their catalog!
	Does anyone out there have the USA 800 number for Eastwood, or
their regular number for that matter?

	Ian and I put the new master cyclinder into Little Martha last night
and came upon that age-old question: Bolt the cylinder to the mount FIRST
and then attach the brake lines, or attach the brake lines FIRST and then
bolt the cylinder to the mount? One wants to NOT use the mass and leverage
of the cylinder to bend/break/weaken the brake lines, natch. So we started
with the cylinder bolted firmly to mount, and attached the aft brake line.
The forward line couldn't be threaded in at that angle, however. So Ian
let me, the owner and prospective user, make the decision and I slacked off
the mounting bolts, lined up and attached the forward brake line and then
tightened up the mounting bolts. So we did one each way. It looked
really nice all finished in there and all. Flush and bleed soon!

	Bill
