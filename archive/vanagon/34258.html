WC Vanagons - the fuel hose you'll find leaking runs from a plastic 
feed-thru fitting on the firewall to a 'rigid' plastic hose running 
forward, almost exactly above the RR axle; and it's 5/16&quot; or 8mm, not 
what I wrote last night  (as an aside, springy type hose clamps are 
bunches better than screw type-as rubber &amp; plastic relax/move with age, 
the springy clamps maintain pressure on the union)
