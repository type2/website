Subject: More EVs and Vanagons on TV


EVs on TV - The other afternoon I was channel surfing and came across one of 
those Hart to Hart movies (you remember robert wagner and stephanie 
powers)...in one of the scenes was a T4 (or EV) close up shot with a little 
girl getting into the T4.

Vanagons - The local PBS station (as well as others I imagine) run a series 
called &quot;Travels in Europe with Rick Steves&quot;. In a couple of the German 
travelogues Rick Steves rents a Vanagon Westy to tour Germany. There are 
some great inside shots of the Westy.....he also &quot;borrows&quot; a Citroen 2CV to 
do a bit of driving in France.
