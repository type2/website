     Kenneth,
     
     How does one do this?  Do you just call up any dealer with your VIN 
     and ask for a report?  Is there a phone number to call?
     
     I have a rebuilt engine in my '87, but I do not know at what exact 
     mileage it was replaced.  I would like to possibly find out if it was 
     replaced by a dealer, maybe it is recorded in a service history 
     somewhere.
     
     Thanks....
     
     'Greg
     '87 Vanagon GL Westy 'Govinda'

You also might run the VIN through VW for a service history. See if the 
speedometer has ever been replaced.
