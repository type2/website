Hi Volks,
    Sorry to clog up the servers with this but I don't know all the LiMBO
Members e-mail address's and since most subscribe to the lists I figured
why not.   Who knows maybe someone else may be interested in this info as
well.  If anyone is going to Searsport this weekend please let me know.  As
of right now I'm going but if Hurricane Hortense comes up the coast... who
knows.  Take care.

&gt;Hi L.i.M.B.O.
&gt;       We have met many of your members over the years at Toronto or down
&gt;in the U.S. and we are looking
&gt;forward to seeing many of you again this weekend. Good to hear that there
&gt;will be a good turnout this year,
&gt;hopefully the wet weather scheduled will turn into glorious sunshine just
&gt;for us. If any Westfalias are
&gt;travelling this week we would love them come and join our small group from
&gt;Ontario, Canada as we camp across
&gt;the U.S. on our way to Searsport, if you are free from Wednesday....if not
&gt;join us 'en route' on the road or
&gt;at the campsites, the plans so far............
&gt;BUSES-BY-THE-BOUY  Searsport, Maine USA -13th, 14th &amp; 15th September 1996
&gt;The Ontario Westfalias Owners Travel Club (W.O.T.C.) trip to MAINE USA
&gt;starts Wednesday 11th September at noon
&gt;from Kingston. Our Westfalia 'wagon train' will travel up the 401 crossing
&gt;St. Lawrence at Prescott and into
&gt;New York State. Following a easterly route across the Adirondack mountains
&gt;along Highway 11 to Burlington,  we
&gt;plan to eat at the New England Culinary Institutes &quot;The Inn at Essex&quot; and
&gt;camp for the night at Lone Pines
&gt;campsite nearby (Canadian at par.in the campsite). After a hearty
&gt;breakfast on Thursday we travel down I-89 to
&gt;Montpelier and take Highway 2 into Maine. Camping Thursday night is at
&gt;Augusta KOA for $5-00 per person. (What
&gt;a deal!) Friday starts early (9am) due to the rendevous in Augusta with a
&gt;large contingent of Westfalias from
&gt;all over the Eastern part of the United States and Canada. Hopefully, more
&gt;canadians (at least 3) will show up
&gt;from New Brunswick again!
&gt;The Official camping weekend will start Friday as the 'Armada' of VW's
&gt;leaves for the trek to Searsport where
&gt;we will camp all weekend. Many more campers will trickle in Friday and
&gt;Saturday. This a fun weekend with lots
&gt;to see, do and eat. Please join our 'International' convoy or go your own
&gt;way, in any case you will enjoy one
&gt;of the East coasts favourite Westfalia events of the year. This is
&gt;expected to be the biggest
&gt;'Buses-by-the-bouy' turn out than any other year.
&gt;.....Bye for now.   Eddy &amp; Lilian  Westfalia Owners Travel Club - Ontario
