   Well volks, I had been working inside the van and inadvertantly left the fire
extinguisher lying on the platform behind the passenger seat instead of in its
bracket.  Leaving home on a short errand, all was fine until I approached
Genitalia Hill,  an extremely short steep grade named for the squishy feeling
one can induce when descending it at an insane rate of speed.
  
   Lurching up the grade from the stop sign at the bottom launched the normally
inert red bullet into the rear where, having lost its pin somehow, it briefly
discharged against the right corner of the bench seat and carpet.
Just as this sequence of events ended, my lovely wife JoAnn panicked, released
her seatbelt and attempted to walk into the rear at which point the van once
again lurched, propelling her bodily into the rear of the van and kicking me in
the jaw in the process.

   The numb jaw was worth it IMO because somehow my faux pas was overlooked, yet
I managed to gain a full week of spousal humiliation rights. &lt;G&gt;
