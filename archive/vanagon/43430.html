Subject: 1980 Oil Change... Simple?

Here's an interesting problem. I was planning on changing my oil for the
first time in the 1980 Vanagon. I had my filter, gaskets, oil, tools in
hand. Crawled under the bus expecting to find the 13mm nut by the oil screen
to dump the oil. I wasn't prepared for what I found. I found what I assume
is some sort of nut. It was roundish with a small tip on one side and a hex
key slot in the middle. It took one of the smaller metric hex wrenches into
it. It was put in with a lot of torque. I was afraid I would strip either
the hex key or the hole so I quit for the evening. Has anyone ever run into
this problem? This engine is out of a 1979 donor bus. It's a 2000cc with
hydraulic valves and fuel injection. 

I assume I can drain the oil by removing the oil screen, then changing the
spin off filter, but I'm rather perplexed at that strange looking bolt, if
that's what it is. I'd like to get the thing out and replace it with the
proper one.

Any advice would be appreciated.
