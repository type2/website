Subject: German bought VWs

Helmut and all our German friends,

	I have quite a few friends who will be coming over from America 
(nach Deutschland) for a few years.

	They are wondering whether they should buy a camper over here and 
then ship it over (military absorbs the shipping cost of one vehicle) or 
wait and buy a camper when they get over to Germany.

	What is the market like in Germany for buying Westfalia campers? 
 Better than the US?  Worse?  A&quot;hnlich?  

	Are any of them already configured for the US?  How much does the 
conversion cost?

	In general, what would your advice be?

TIA,

Tschuss

Thad
