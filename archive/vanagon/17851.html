Subject: Re: Cost of Eurovans?

Hey Now,
I also bought a 95 EV with EVERYTHING... camper top, awning, fridge, sink,
stove
extra middle seat, (topvent,front,side,rear)screens, propane furnace, auto, ac,
floor mats (front,rear), rear tent.. except the cargo carrier on top. The
dammage was 32.5K plus tax. Does anyone else find it strange that you can
only get the campers in white. Luckily that was my color of choice.

So far I have only one complaint and that is that over 55 mph it vibrates
more that would be expected. If anyone has any leads on stabilizer bars
that's my next investment if I can find one. Other than that my life
has become a blissful place outside of work.

robert.

ps. If anyone is on spring tour you'll know it's me with the shinny new EV.

&gt; I will second this, with a little more detail; ours has all options EXCEPT
&gt; the Weekender poptop, and the automatic tranny.
&gt;
&gt; Money being a relative thing, I figure the true cost of this vehicle is
&gt; really
&gt; not that bad.  Another way to look at it is this:  He who dies most massively
&gt; in debt has come out ahead in the end.   ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, just be sure you don't have any heirs...
&gt;
&gt; Seriously, though, I think the EV is a pretty slick automotive creation very
&gt; much in the mold of the T1s, 2s, and 3s before it (you just have to know
&gt; where to look)
