Subject: San Diego busses

I recently exchanged messages with someone who wanted to know if there 
were any rust-free busses in California (there are!) and what typical 
prices are.  I compiled this list for him, and thought I'd post it in 
case anyone else is interested.  This is taken from a recent issue of 
pre-88 Truck Trader (San Diego edition).  Most are private-party and none 
have obvious cancer.
