Gerry,

 dang it, all I could come up with in a search for you is this silly
vanagon stuff.

E mail me at misterbob_at_theriver_dot_com =20

Do it soon, or reach me in st. louis at the end of the month at
desljc_at_aol_dot_com

By the way, pick a number (don't tell me silly), multiply by 9, add =
digits
of product together, subract 5.  If letters correspond with numbers =
a=3D1,
b=3D2, etc.  find your letter and name a country that begins with that
letter. Now pick the next letter of the alphabet and name an animal that
begins with that letter and also think of what color it is.

Let me know you're alive, don't tell me your answer, and write back the
rest of the trick.

Love,

Bob Shogren, a.k.a., Mr. Bob, a.k.a., Bob
