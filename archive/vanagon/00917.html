Subject:      nose protector phone number?

Er... well I logged the company that I think Steve told me abiout re: a nose
protector for the 85 vanagon. As it is in my log, I can't get to it unless I
download. I'm not in a position to do that but was wondering if someone might
have the phone number handy.
