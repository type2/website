&gt;Has anyone out there replaced the barrel and tumblers on their
&gt;ignition switch?  I need to do this for Georg, my 1973 campmobile
&gt;rekeyed?

   I have re-done the ignition on a couple of VWs and it's not too hard.
Certainly not worth 80 bills.  You have do have to be able to turn the
key to get the unit apart...   I just ended up with two keys. ;)
