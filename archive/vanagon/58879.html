Subject: apparently aol4free virus warning not a hoax

For details see:

Just noticed that there seemed to be some hostility on the list to the
person who brought it up.  I received a message from the corporate office
of the company that I work for (SAIC, also the owner of InterNIC) that
apparently this virus warning is quite real.
