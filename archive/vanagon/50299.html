Stuffing the cavities full of insulation may trap unwanted condensation =
which leads to our number one enemy...... rust!  (This also happens when =
you insulate old houses and they end up with dry rot instead of rust).
Try some of the newer sound deadening insulations that are designed to =
do what you want.  It's more expensive in the short term but worth it.

     I did the same thing. The only thing I thought of later is will
     the insulation settle? But in the mean time it works great!
