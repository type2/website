Subject: tents? we don't need no steekin'...

Had an opportunity to try out the Bob Hoover inspired
split PVC pipe with ubiquitous blue tarp this past
CCC weekend, worked pretty well except for my having
split the PVC pipe a little too much to hold the tarp
onto the spray rail, had to keep screwing with that.

The idea is to split some scrap PVC lengthwise and use
that to clamp an edge of the tarp onto the 
spray rail. My spousal unit has some poles from a
canopy, so we used those to hold up the outside
corner of the tarp. Provided privacy and shade,
and the price was right (compared to a '76 tent!)

Also had the opportunity to break out the rear
hatch bug screen and the weird front curtain,
which worked great! Thanks to the long lost
former owner for not losing these items... now
where's ya put the Westy table?!?! : ' )

My views do not necessarily reflect those of the
place I'm contracting at (they seem to like
Fords better than old VWs anyway)
