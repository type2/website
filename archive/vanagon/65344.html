&gt; Now a lot of folks have been asking for the BIG posting I promised about
&gt; soundproofing/insulation/rustproofing VW's and I am working diligently on it.
&gt; It is now 5 pages in Word, and will probably come to an even dozen.
&gt;
&gt; I know there's got to be a better way to stick this fascinating tome out
&gt; there than e-mailing 12 pages of text to everyone on the list. Can some
&gt; kindhearted listee write or call and hold my hand through whatever I need to
&gt; do? (I washed this morning, I swear).
