Subject: Re: Nuts!...Axle Nuts!

Ken Bowen askes &quot;How are you going to get a socket on the nut you have 
just beat to shit with a mallet and chisel?&quot;
  Beats me why anybody would do that.  I certainly didn't suggest it 
either.  The single good chisel cut I suggested still allows a 6 point 
socket to fit on well enough, and even if it created an interference 
bump, a few careful file strokes would allow it to fit.


I also did not indicate that this proceedure was done &quot;on a regular 
basis.&quot;  To the contrary, it is an exceptional approach for the 
exceptionally tough nut.  After this removal technique, replacement of 
the nut is probably in order.

&quot;It is a common error to see in others that which you find in yourself.&quot;

  Best Wishes,
  John Wakefield
