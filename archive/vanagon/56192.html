CV's again -

&gt;  I've also been told, for
&gt; you really cheap volks, that you could try reversing the shaft on the
&gt; bus so that they turn in the opposite direction. The threory is that the
&gt; pressure on the CV is in a different spot than the worn spot making the
&gt; CV usable again.  Doing this will buy you some time. 

Almost true.  To gain time, you must flop the CV's from one side of 
the transaxle to the other.  It doesn't matter which CV (inner or 
outer) is where, what matters is the side of the transmission it came 
from.  For manual transmissions, you can switch the entire axle, for 
automatics you have to remove the CV's from the axle 
(different length of axle L/R on autos)

If anyone has trouble visualizing this, pmail me, I have a visual aid 
I can describe to allow to gain understanding.

BTW I have 200K on my CV's, trying to buy some time.  They sound 
REALLY bad in reverse or downshifting.
