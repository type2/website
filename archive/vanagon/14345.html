Subject: Rappin' on oil loss

&gt;
&gt;Hey Wolf MacGrady!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;But again -
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; How much oil do you go through?  One quart every 1000
&gt;&gt;&gt;miles? 500 miles? 250 miles?
&gt;
Wolf,

'The Beast', a '74 dual-carb jobby;  uses about 1/2L every 
400 miles.  But then it also has what I suspect to be a 
leak from the oil cooler seal...  Which people on the list
said could be replaced with the engine in.  Hopefully.
--Ralf
