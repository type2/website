&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Just read VWoA's Volkswagen World article entitled, 'True North: To the
&gt;Top of the World by Volkswagen'.  It gives a different perspective of the 
&gt;trip than the recounts on the net.  I was a little disappointed not seeing
&gt;Hoover's 65 in the pics, nor mention of him.  Oh well, whaddaya expect
&gt;from a Corporate Club Magazine.  All in all, a nice article from VWoA,
&gt;reflecting pride in their past, IMHO.  8-)

Actually, there's an innocent reason that Bob isn't reflected in the
article photos. Like the true individual that he is, he was often driving
on his own, away from the pack.  He actually *does* show up in the line-up
shot that leads the article, but the photo was clipped to fit the page.
(Bob was at the back of the line.)  The original shot showed 11 vans in a
row, while the cropped version only showed 7 vans.  Eddie Hintz, Jack
Stafford, the Kanes, and Bob were cropped out.
