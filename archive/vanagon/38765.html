Subject: starting prob with my 75 westy.

well, i actually have the westy sold, if i can fix this problem.  can 
anybody help me??????

simptoms:
when i try and start the bus, i turn the key and it fires right up.  
engine starts all right, but the starter does not disengage.  i can hear 
the starter motor spinning while the motor is running.  if i turn the key 
back to start a few times, the starter will disengage and i can take off.

what i have done:
i replaced the electrical unit in the ignition, thinking it was 
sticking.  this has really done nothing to sure the problem.  could this 
be my silinoid sticking, or something else?  i really want to get rid of 
this bus as i don't want to learn about the type 4 fuel injected motor.  
40hp motors will do me just fine.

thanks in advance and God Bless
matt
