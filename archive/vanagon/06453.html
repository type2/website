Subject:  Rough Idle, Engine Stalls - Tow in

The clamp for the air intake boot to air flow meter/throttle body may
yield tension and could cause a vacuum leak.  This may create a lean
running condition resulting in the engine to idle rough and in
severe cases stall while idling.

Installation of Boot Clamp Part Number 191 129 647  will correct this
condition.

Easy Does It

When removing the cross-over water pipe on a 1982 through 1985 model 1.9
liter Vanagon waterboxer engine ... you have to use care.

The cross-over pipe is secured to a welded stud on the intake manifold
(arrow) that could break or crack.

If this happens, a vacuum leak could develop that would be hard to
detect. Such a vacuum leak could cause poor performance under all
running conditions due to leaning out of the mixture ... and would
occur even when all other systems are go.
