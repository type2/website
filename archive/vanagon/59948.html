Subject: Re: Coolant Refill Bottle

&gt;&gt;I've noticed that my coolant refill bottle seems to run dry, in the space of
&gt;&gt;about a week.  
&gt;I have the same problem.  As far as I know, all coolant leaks were fixed
&gt;and I STILL have a regularly dry overflow bottle.  I'll be looking for
&gt;suggestions, too.
&gt;

Me too.  Maybe this is a very common problem.
