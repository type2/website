Dear VWers,

Over the weekend, I replaced the cylinders &amp; pistons on my 80 vanagon &amp; an
exhuast valve on Cyl #1. The engine is still on the floor, hence a good 
opportunity to correct any thing that I haven't done right.
Here is my questions, as usual your help is really great. 
Thanks in advance:

1- Is there a way of checking the compression/leakage before I put the 
   engine back in the van?

2- I didn't take the hydraulic lifters out. Are they now dry after moving
   the engine up and down so many times? Do I need to take the lifters 
   out and refill them with oil in order to be able to adjust the valves?

3- On the valve that I replaced, the head looked good. Is it pretty much a 
   must the you would have to re-grind the head everytime you replace the
   valve?

Regards,
Vahid
