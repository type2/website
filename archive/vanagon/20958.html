&gt; 
&gt; Scott Beckstead claims that cooling the radiator makes an engine retain
&gt; heat, but I've been driving for 30 winters now and I ain't buyin'.  I
I'm not doubting what Scott has said, actually.  But, I guess I don't really
understand how it short-circuits the cooling process.  Hot coolant is inside
the radiator, air blows through the fins, air heats up and carries away the
heat. If water is placed on the radiator, the heat will be transferred to the
water, it will evaporate and carry away heat also.  Water does have a higher
heat capacity than air also so I'd expect more heat to be taken away by the
water.  
Anyway, what Scott really said was that a cool radiator forces the
engine to retain heat, inspite of the method of cooling the radiator.  I
suppose I don't understand this exactly but I am quite willing to learn
more.
