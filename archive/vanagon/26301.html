&gt; While getting more intimate with my engine I found two more 
&gt; perplexing thingies.  One seems to be an air outlet on the upper left 
&gt; rear of the engine.  it points straight to the left and is not 
&gt; connected to anything.  The other is a thin black bar directally above 
&gt; the fan housing.  It is spring loaded and actuated by a cable that 
&gt; goes straight down. It is resemblent of the accelerator hookup.  If 
&gt; any one could tell me what these systems are and how to properly hook 
&gt; them up I would apreciate it.

The former I cannot identify without a more complete description, but
the latter is your air flap/thermostat system.  The cable controls the
air flaps, which are attached to the bar.  The cable goes straight down,
around a pulley and forward to the thermostat, which is attached to the
sump on the bottom of the engine.
