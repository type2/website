Subject:      Re: Oettinger Letter In German

On Sat, 15 Oct 94 10:33:08 CDT &lt;DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com&gt; said:
&gt;Oettinger sent me a note with my last order of fogg lamp pieces from Germany
&gt;but I cannot read the letter. Can anybody tell me if it is important?

Then Martha said:
&gt;Derek - basically the German on your Oettinger letter is telling you
&gt;that Oettinger states they are the German manufacturer of the equipment
&gt;you possess, and that they meet US standards.  ( I think )  :)

oh, yee of little lawyer-experience!!! :)   i think it is a legal-copout to
placate the US DOT folks, and says something like this (taking into account
Derek's typos and leaving off of the umlauts!):

The Undersigned, Exporter of the products,
and from which the Customs accounting was obtained,
explains, for these Products, as far as no others are declared,
the presumption of the attainment of the original quality
is that they conform to that of products previously favorably
sold in the USA
and that the country of origin of these products is Germany.

in other words,
our lawyers told us to put this in so you can't sue us and your government
can't make us re-certify all this crap for your car and we never heard of
your or your dog. :)  &lt;Party of the First Part herewith sells to the Party
of the Second Part ... etc.&gt;
