Subject:      window seal info

Hi Volks,

Sorry it's taken so long to post this. It's probably been forgotten by now,
but last week when I posted about replacing my front windshield in the '85
Rustfalia, I mentioned I bought a new front window seal from Kyle at
Volksmotorsports for $40. That is correct, but Kyle misquoted me and
honored the lower price. He says his official quote is $49.99, which still
beats the pants off any other quote I got. Also, the seal Kyle sent me was
made in Germany!  BTW, this is the euro-style without the chrome trim
groove.

Hope this is of some help to someone.
