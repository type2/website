&gt;&gt; When I was shopping for CV boots, I asked for German - this FLforeignAPS
&gt;guy
&gt;&gt; said &quot;these are Brazilian.  They don't make 'em in Germany anymore&quot;.
&gt;Suuure
&gt;&gt; they don't!  He also tried to sell me 8mm star bolts after I asked for 6mm
&gt;&gt; 6-point allen bolts - &quot;All VW busses use these&quot;.. Yeah, right, bye now!

Bolts are not identified by the size of the wrench.  They are identified by
the diameter of the shank.  The VW uses 8mm x45mm x1.25.  Grade 10.9 or 12.9
prefered.  Some Audis and Porsches use 10mm bolts.
