Subject: RE: Adj. Parking Brake

Hi!

To adjust the parking brake on a 71:

First adjust your rear brake shoes:  Jack up the rear wheels and working 
from behind the backing plate, turn the two star adjusters (you can see when 
you look through the holes in the backing plate (one turns up to expand, 
the other turns down)) so that the brake shoes are closer to the drum.  The 
goal is to adjust them so that when you rotate the wheel by hand you can 
feel the brake shoes rub &quot;gently&quot; on the drum.  When both wheels are 
adjusted, now working from inside the bus, slide up the rubber boot on the 
bottom of the lever that goes from the parking brake handle on one end and 
to the floor on the other.  You will see the ends of the parking brake 
cables and their respective adjusting nuts and locking nuts.  Loosen the 
locking nuts, being careful not to twist the cables.  Pull out the parking 
brake handle six clicks, then tighten down the adjusting nuts evenly on 
both cables.  You want to tighten them until you can rotate the rear wheels 
by hand only with real effort.  Tighten down the locking nuts when you have 
achieved this.  Release the parking brake and rotate the rear wheels 
to check for binding.  If all is ok you're done.

Good luck!
