Subject: a/c compressor blows seal

Well, I guess I'm joining the ranks of those seeking cool.  My 
brother-in-law and I charged up the a/c system on my '87 GL last 
night and it was blowing wonderful 50F air until the bottom of the 
compressor started spewing oil, dripping on the exhaust, and there 
was smoke everywhere.  

The compressor is not seized, but it looks like the oil is coming 
from somewhere around the clutch, I believe.  

Any ideas whether this might be rebuildable or if it's new compressor 
time?
