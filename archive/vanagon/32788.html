Subject: Re: Netiquette Help Please--Mail List Filters

I set my filter up so...

If the TO: line contains vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu then the mail goes to my
Vanagon mail in-box UNLESS the CC: line contains drew_at_interport_dot_net

Also, 

If the CC: line contains vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu then the mail goes to my
Vanagon in-mail box UNLESS the TO: line contains drew_at_interport_dot_net

This system works flawlessly.

&gt;&quot;To&quot;  is you own name and email address and is the same for all email received.

I don't think so. I think the TO: line is the vanagon list.

&gt;&quot;Message Body&quot; no filter available for this portion of the message.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, the &quot;Message body&quot; contains the line &quot;To: Multiple recipients of list
&gt;&lt;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot; and is the only place where the use of the word
&gt;&quot;Vanagon&quot; always appears.  This would be ideal to filter on but like I said,
&gt;the filters do not work on the &quot;message body&quot;.

Eudora can filter on the message body!
