Subject: Re: Head Welded, '80 (long) &amp; Shop Recommendation

&gt; He went through what they do to assure that the Type 4 valve seats 
&gt; won't drop.  I like their approach and solution to the common problem.
&gt; I'd like specific details on what other vendors do to provent seats 
&gt; from dropping, anyone?, specifically what does Mark Stephens do?
&gt; 
&gt; Impressed with AVP, or could you tell.  BTW he didn't know of my 
&gt; connection to this list until AFTER the work was done, so no special 
&gt; favors were given, just a good business to work with.
&gt; 

Leonard learned his trade from Stephens if you believe Stephens, the 
technique is the same regardless except one peens a bit of metal over 
the seat the other does not.  I'd say either fine, AVP will take 
about anything for a core, Stephens has been doing it longer and is a 
bit more picky.  Go with whoever is the best price as a rule for the 
condition of your core.  I'm still have only mixed feelings about the 
2.0 I bought from AVP for the '81, will get around to tearing it 
down to decide if anything is wrong sometime this summer.  Others 
experience with Stephens is no better.  Both are fairly quality 
companies, who don't always seem to stand behind their work 
technically once the sale is gone.  AVP will also not do any head 
performance work, they build real LOW compression stock engines.  
They are supposed to be the shit for wasserboxer head repair though.
