Subject: Re: 1800cc type 4 carb adjustment...

David,
  Thanx for your advice. I figured something was fishy. But since the idle
is at 900 now and running well, I'll just leave it alone for the time being.
In the long run, I'd like to rebuild the twin carbs (new needle valves,
gaskets, orings I guess?), but not now. Would you know if there is a rebuild
kit on the market somewhere? The only carb I ever took apart was in a Stihl
chainsaw, but the way I figure it the bus is just a rather large chainsaw,
right? Thanx again,

                        Gregor

&gt; &gt;Dear list, &gt;
&gt;  Does anyone know which way to turn the idle speed adjustment screw in the
&gt; &gt;central idle unit of the 1800cc\twin carbs bus to REDUCE idle speed? This
&gt; &gt;screw is the LARGE one of the 2. Mine is screwed all the way IN, and if I
&gt; &gt;loosen the screw the rpm's will eventually go down, but only at the expense
&gt; &gt;of a nasty SUCKING SOUND...Doesn't sound right...
&gt;
&gt; Screwing it  IN (i.e. clockwise) should slow the idle down, and the sucking
&gt; sound should be reduced to nothing before it is all the way in.  Unscrewing
&gt; it (counterclockwise) should increase the sucking sound and speed up the
&gt; idle.  The louder the sucking sound, the higher the idle, in other words.
&gt; If your system doesn't work like this, something is broken or hooked up
&gt; wrong.  I don't know of any way to advise further without seeing the
&gt; engine, unfortunately.  Hope this helps...
