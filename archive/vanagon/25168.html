Maybe you Gals and Guys can help...

I'm torn choosing my next project.  Its either the '65 notchback or the
'61 double door kombi.

Notchback:
advantages: somewhat rare, reasonably straight and complete, and I don't
have one.
disadvantages: have to delve into the mysterious world of type III's

     Go for the Notchback! Of course, I am biased.....

     (I'll help you keep it from  being too mysterious....)
