Subject: RE: Oil on the rear window!!!

The cam is lubricated properly from splash.  There are no engines that 
submerge a camshaft intentionally.  Too much windage causes heat build up and 
foaming.  Race engines run dry sump systems and actually keep the pan near 
empty.  Almost all engines have the dipsticks calibrated so that the full mark 
is actually an overfull condition.  This is to accommodate normal losses and 
inattentive owners.  Installing an oil temp and pressure gauge will show the 
harmful effects of overfilling these engines.  Not only do oil temps rise, but 
watch the falling pressure as the oil gets aerated.  You still need to find 
the leak though.  Check the breather mounting to the engine block and the hose 
to the air inlet.

Curt:
At the full mark the cam shaft is submerged in oil, the only source of
lubrication for the lobe-to-tappet surfaces. The shaft is ABOVE (out of)
 the oil at the low mark.
Good Luck

&gt;
&gt;At about 1/2 quart down from &quot;full&quot;,  it no longer leaks.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a common fix for this, or does everyone run 1/2 quart down?
