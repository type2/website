Subject: Rear hatch lock revisited

Thank you to everybody who responded to my question yesterday regarding
the lock on my rear hatch. They were all very helpful. After reading all
the responses, I did some further investigation and have some follow-up
questions:

My van is a '90 Westy with power door locks. I noticed if the front
doors are locked the key will unlock the rear hatch. If the front doors
are not locked I can't figure out how to open the rear hatch, key or no
key.

Any hints now, my friends? :-)
