&gt; says you need to have the inner race pressed in.  Is it possible to get it
&gt; in by freezing it and then driving it in with a disc-like item (i.e. frozen
&gt; chocolate chip cookie or something similar).

We always used a hammer, punches and a drift to drive them.  Once you get
the old races out you use them to drive the new ones in so that you don't
damage the new ones.  Using a press is probably easier but this method
has always worked for us. 

&gt;  washer) for the circlip to be seated. When I took it to VW to be pressed on
&gt; the mechanics told me to use a 30mm socket to hammer the hub down and the
&gt; circlip would seat--that's what they do.

I have used a hammer and drift to do the same thing.

&gt; So my question is--who uses all those fancy tools pictured in Bentley if the
&gt; folks at VW don't.  Is this some sort of hoax????

The people at the factory is my guess.  They probably have a VW tool number
for a 13mm wrench!  ;-)
