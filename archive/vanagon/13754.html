Subject: redrock - bring list

I apologize to keep having to post things piecemeal, but
things are disorganized here because of my change of
accounts and e-mail access.  Anyway, I forgot to post
earlier - please bring lots of things like utensils, paper
plates, cups, glasses, etc.  This can be either the permanent-
variety or disposable, as per your choice.  If the disposable
stuff is paper-based, I guess we can always use it for
kindling in the firepit (and yes, please bring lots of
wood!).  Last time, we nearly ran out of both wood
and utensils, plates, cups, etc. - so if in doubt, throw
in plenty, and if you're worried about losing it, you
may want to label it.  

Don't forget your folding chairs!
