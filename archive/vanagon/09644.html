&gt; Southeast:
&gt;   OH   6 folks  this would be the biggest area covered, putting 32 folks
&gt;   KY   1 folke  within reach of a get-together, perhaps in the east-TN
&gt;   AL   1 folke  border with VA/NC/SC ... which sounds to me like the
&gt;   MD   4 folks  Blue Ridge Parkway or Smokey Mountain Nat'l Park. or some
&gt;   VA   3 folks  other place of note (like Boone, NC or maybe even Blowing
&gt;   NC  11 folks  Rock, NC. :) &lt;not REAL suggestions, by the way!&gt;
&gt;   SC   1 folke
&gt;   GA   5 folks
&gt;   DC   1 folke

    First of all, thank you Joel for the excellent figures- you *have*
to join us of course, so we can all get autographs...
     So, How does Western N.C. sound to everyone still interested? I
will look tonight through all my vacation pamphlets/maps/atlases to look
for poswible spots in that immediate area. I'll post anything
interesting tomorrow, so anyone else interested please suggest possible
spots you think might be suitable. Wow, if we can get all 32 of us to
go...
Richard the stoked
