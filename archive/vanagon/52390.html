Subject: re: yukon stories

I've received some mail from a woman looking for information on why the
heck anyone would travel TO the Yukon.

Tracy writes:
&gt;I have checked the web page and its not quite what i need.  I would like to
&gt;hear people's stories but also why they traveled to this destination. Was it
&gt;because of the adventure(as an example)?  What other kinds of travel do they
&gt;enjoy? Where do they go, what do they do, and why? I wold like to know their
&gt;age and rough income level. How did they hear about Inuvik and the Yukon?
&gt;That is about all I can think of right now. Do you know anyone that would be
&gt;interested in telling me their story? Thanks, Tracy

If anyone of the Inuvikkers wants to help, write Tracy at
'terman_at_yukoncollege.yk_dot_ca'.
