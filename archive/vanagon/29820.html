Seriously just came across the old '86 booklets, if anyone has a need
first come first served.  Hell I read them just for kicks (never had
before) and just found out something that makes me feel like a complete
idiot.

I swear I never knew that there is an extension tube in the oil fill on
the vanagon, I always simply cursed it and used a funnel, boy do I feel
the idiot, but hell dad never knew either, gues we didn't take the full
dealer demo back when we bought it.
