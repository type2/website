So Sglw_at_aol_dot_com says:

This bounced so I'm sending it to the list, sorry about that all.

&gt; 
&gt; I am sorry to have offended you but please tell me what it is politely
&gt; 

Oops!  Apparently you didn't get the joke.  That why there were smiley
faces [ ;) ].

I was just making a jealousy joke about you owning all of those wonderful 
'50's vintage Type II's.

Sorry that you didn't know that it was for amusement.

Cheers!

Steven
