Subject: re:no start/road trip--solved

 Finally made it home. The problem turned out to be a frayed wire (top 
one) on the fuel pump. It must have been coincidence that when the dist. 
was clamped down that it decided to start up at that moment! So Franz 
unwittingly added to his mystique :)  Strange thing was his underling had 
removed a spark plug, poured in gas, but it still wouldn't start.
 
Thanks to all who wrote in with suggestions.
