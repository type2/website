&gt; stripped the head of one bolt...the head is still there but the ratchet doesn't
&gt; fit anymore. then i tried with some vise grips. no give. then i tried
&gt; saturating it with WD40. no give. any suggestions? i'm guessing if i can't get
&gt; it off, i'm going to have to put all the other bolts back on take the van to
&gt; a shop or something.

  I had the same problem on my '70. After trying all the normal methods,
  I got the angle grinder and ground out a `flat' on either side of the 
  bolt head, heated the bugger up, and then used a open ended spanner to 
  turn the bolt. It did the trick. Eventually.
