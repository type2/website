Subject:       Cost of Operating Vanagon

I did a cost of operation for my 83 Waterboxer - details below.  Is 
this about right??

My 83 Waterboxer turned over 114K miles this past month.  Since I had 
kept up the maintenance and repairs faithfully with either VW or by 
doing it my self.  I thought it would be interesting to see how much this vehicle cost on a long 
term ownership vs leasing.

My cost came out to pennies shy of $165.00 per month for 156 months 
of ownership and at a cost of $.2246 per mile.  This cost does not 
gasoline or insurance.  I guess gas and insurance would add about 10 
cents per mile or less.
