Subject: 85 single cab

Hi folks.  I was shopping for a cursed 10mm 12 spline thing last night 
and went to sears.  The salesman asked what I was looking for, told 
hime, and he smiled.

He's a volks fan too.

He has an 85 single cab transporter that he wants to sell.  says it was 
one of 400 imported into Canada.

Says every thing is in excellent condition.  I don't know how many 
klicks it has on the motor.

He is asking $CDN 7500.oo. 

There you go.  I never did find that cursed tool and its holding ip 
progress on the dismantling of my type IV motor.  Would any one have a 
spare?

Oh yeah, the guy's name is Peter at 705-673-5168
