Questions to '86 Kombi (stripped Vanagon, cheap working model)

&gt;This model was widely available in Europe, but I don't know if they sold
&gt;many.

This was the common sold model in Europe.

&gt;How about Vanagon-style?

Vanagon production ends 7/90 in Europe. A similar Version is still built
in South Africa.

&gt;Do they still make Kombis in the EV style?

Yes, VW continues building EV in all family members Vanagon had: Single Cab=
,
Double Cab, Panel Wagon, Simple Kombi, Exclusive Family Kombi (Multi Van),
all Models comes with short or long wheelbase, Panel Wagon and Kombis also
available with factory high roofs.
