Subject: Hard to Shift
Date: Wed, 30 Aug 95 9:56:52 PDT

The past couple of days I've been experiencing some very hard
shifting in my '65 bus.  Driving to work in the morning, shifting
is fine(sometimes a little loose) but by lunch(has sat for 3 hours)
shifting is starting to get real stiff.  When it is time to leave work
shifting is requiring a lot of muscle. I have no problems finding the
gears.

Any ideas what the problem may be?
