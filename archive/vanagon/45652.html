Subject: Re: Cool VW story

&gt;Last night, Hwy 50 in Sacramento was the place to be for busses.
&gt;Yes, I did get her number.  In fact, this was one of the few times
&gt;I got a girls phone number and cash didn't change hands first...
&gt;
&gt;Then after I left, I see the Bus Farmers going the other way,
&gt;coming back from their camping trip.  It was a moment.


Thom,

If you deny the existence of god after this encounter, you'll be forever
damned to driving a VW 412!
