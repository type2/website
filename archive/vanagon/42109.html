&gt;&gt; Seems all the bolts but ONE fell out of the driver side reduction

&gt;I had similiar experiences.  My solution was to disassemble it down to
&gt;the swing tube, take it to a machine shop and have them put thread
&gt;inserts into the soft metal inner casing of the reduction boxes.  It is a
&gt;good idea not to use any 'screwed' up bolts when you put it all back
&gt;together.  8-)    Good luck.

The Bozobus went the Heli-Coil path as well.
Did the &quot;machining&quot; myself.
The Heli-Coil kit was *expensive*, and I had to go to a FLAPS warehouse
supply outlet to get it (something like $54US in '91).
Try to get the &quot;self-locking&quot; variety of insert - this reduces the reliance
on the bent tab-thingy or simple split-ring lockwashers to keep the bolts
in place.

Be careful not to punch through *into* the oil-filled xfer case.
The gear oil is smelly and expensive, and it's disheartening to watch it
flow straight through to the floor.
I did this twice (years apart). Fixed the leak by putting a huge gobbet of
PermaTex #2 (or #3?) in the hole bottom and on the end of the bolt.
