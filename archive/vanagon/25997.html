Subject: Hit &amp; Run Insurance

Volks,

Ahh, the insurance industry, them are some sick puppies.  

Uninsured Motorist Property Damage does NOT cover a hit &amp; run if the car
can't be identified.  You must be able to prove to your own insurance
company that the car that hit you was not insured.  Not possible if you
don't have the plate number.  This means the hit on my 1971 bus is a total
loss for me, completely uninsured for this event.  Those hit &amp; run guys got
it made.  I'm thinking of taking it up myself.  I should've floored the bus
until it seized, that plate number was CRUCIAL.

People of the Vanagon list, check your insurance, get collision insurance
and get your busses appraised by a knowledgable VW vintage person.  Get a
couple appraisels, just to make sure.  Even then you'll probably have to
fight for your money, but at least the paperwork will be on your side.

Get headrests, or make some thing that works like one.  

Eug,
physically fine but fucking furious
