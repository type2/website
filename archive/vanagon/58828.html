Subject: Re: Dont blink your lights! *GANG DANGER*

And the worst part of it is when you get out of the hospital and start
going through your mail, you'll find  that Marshal Field has billed your
credit card $250 for a cookie recipie (for which  you thought you'd only
paid $2.50) which you purchased to send along with a card to that boy
trying set the world record for receiving get well cards who (tragically)
had just suffered a recent setback because his hard disk (containing the
get well card database) was destroyed by a virus he got simply by reading
an e-mail from AOL entitled &quot;Good Times&quot;.


I'll be dammed if it doesn't make you just want to strap a solid fuel
rocket (JATO) booster on the top of the ol' Syncro and drive into an
Arizona cliff at 300 mph (wonder if the pop-top would stay closed).

&gt;*Welcome to the new world!* =(
&gt;If you see any car driving without their lights on (at night) DO NOT blink
&gt;your lights at them. Even though you might be thinking that you are doing a
&gt;good deed in desire for saftey, you are, in fact, placing yourself in danger.
&gt;
&gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself the
&gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally left
&gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks their
&gt;lights at them intending to add to the saftey factor. The good samaritian
&gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter.
&gt;
&gt;I tend to think that I have a fairly decent &quot;sidewalk diploma&quot; in street
&gt;smarts but this was a new one on me. If I can help keep you and your family
&gt;NOS then all the better.
&gt;Peace, (please)

&gt;BTW: No need to belabor this thread- just file it away for the future. This
&gt;post is not intended to inflame any non VW socieconomic discussions. Please,
&gt;let's take personal rants &lt;if any&gt; off line. =)
