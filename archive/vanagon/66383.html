Sure, you can paint plastic.


&gt; Any idea on how much it would be for a new or used rear bumper on a
&gt; 1991 ?

Since the AL rear bumper is so weak as to give almost no protection at
all, and now minor taps have bent both ends and the end caps are off, I
was thinking of installing a nice big board across the rear!  It would
give more protection, and be cheap too!  Just a coupe of coats of
verithane or shelac.  What you all think?
