Subject: Wanted: from &lt;'74 refrigerator (Westy)

Howdy all, just thought I'd throw this request out to those with good junkyard
access.
 On the earlier Westfalia refrigerators (before about '74), on the side facing
the cargo doors, there is a smallish cabinet, with a small, about 10&quot;x10&quot; table
on the side that folds out, for a stove or whatever. This cabinet/table is
mounted with several screws on the side of the refrigerator. Anyway, if anyone
has an extra, or could get one for cheap at a junkyard, please let me know, and
perhaps we can work out something.
Thanksm
Richar
