I just finished trying to fix the little flap inside the door lock 
cylinder on the passengers side. Unfortunately it was so bent that it had
to be pulled out. The flap is spring loaded so that it flips back after the
key is removed. I suppose with the flap removed dirt will enter more easily
 but at last we can use the door...

The handle itself is very easy to remove-one screw right by the door lock
and it pulls out from the body..this will make it easier when we paint the
van.....DC
