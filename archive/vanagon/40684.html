Subject: ENgine needed - ASAP PLEASE!

Okay, going to make this short and sweet:

I need an engine for my '69 Westy.  I would like to get a complete one,
rebuilt w/ new accessories if possible.  I only want a single port, single
releif engine.

I am about to order a GEX longblock for $800.  If you have ANYTHING THAT IS
POSSIBLY BETTER LET ME KNOW!

I am in Stockton, CA which is near Sacramento.

Thanks
-Marlin
