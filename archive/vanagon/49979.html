Subject: air cooled list

A friend is thinking of buying a '79 bus and would like to suscribe to 
the air cooled list. Can somebody tell him (or me) how to suscribe? Oh, 
and if anybody has any thoughts about the automatic transmission of 
this year, he'd sure appreciate it as the one in question isn't 
functional. Is there a FAQ anywhere? Send any info to:

Paul Smiley
creekhouse_at_cinternet_dot_com  or  bluejordan_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com
(personal)                    (record label we're on)

Thanks!
