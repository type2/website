Subject: Re: Need to get tanked ('81 Vanagon)

To Bob Hufford and the list -

Unfortunately (and to my despair recently) brand new Wanagon tanks are only
available from the dealer and at an intolerable price.  I really had to
search high and low for a good used one in a boneyard for my '80.  The
problem with finding a boneyard tank is that most boneyards move their junk
vehicles with a forklift.  When ya combine forklift with a Vanagon that has
its tank towards the front and bottom of the vehicle.....well ya get my drift
don't ya?  They literally cruch the suckers, rendering them useless.  I've
educated a few boneyard types close by, but no Vanagons lately to pull tanks
from.
