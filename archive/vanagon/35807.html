Subject:  help -- hard to find part

Hey all,

Well, now I'm asking for another part.  The part in question ('78 bus) is
the hose you use to pressurize the windshield washer reservoir.  Mine
has rotted away.  I ordered from the VW dealer and I just called them and
they've said that the part has been discontinued.  Soooo, I was
wondering if someone out there either has one that doesn't leak that they
don't want anymore or if someone could look in one of their catalogs (like
WCM or RMMW -- mine hasn't come yet) and let me know they carry
them so I can call them up.  

Any help is appreciated

Thanks,
Sean
