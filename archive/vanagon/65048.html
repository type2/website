Subject:      FALL MIDATLANTIC CAMPING

Well as the crisp cool days and nights begin to start and as the kids
come back to school I begin thinking as usual that fall is my
favorite camping time.  Nothing quite like getting up at 7 am only
to find it's about 35F outside and you have to walk 200 yards to the
cold showers.  Anyway, since we east coasters are slackers as a rule, but
since we did get down to Scenaca Rocks and Dolly Sods in early
October last year, I'm interested in getting something going.
Something withing say 5-6 hours driving of the DC metro area,
wherever we might like.  My first suggestiong would be a Blue Ridge
leaf watchers gathering in VA, but I'm up for PA, NC, WV, wherever.
As lazy as we all seem to be out here it's never to early to start
some planning.  I'll head this thing up if we get any interest.  To
me early october is good unless we do a leaf thing, in that case we
have to plan accordingly.
