Subject: Re: To wear a bra or not to wear a bra, that is the question!

Four quick comments (short for a change) ;)

1. Agree with and support the precautions that have already been expounded
in previous posts.

2. Ran one on a '70 Ghia convert that I used to own and would trade mt left
er, ah ~handed pliers to have back. Never had a problem.

3. Intend to get a matching green and white &quot;Mothers Bra Co&quot; bra for the
Westy from Hell when completed. (after saving the $$$).

4. Foolishly passed on a used black cheapie bra for a 63-67 TypeII last week
at Phoenix Bug-o-Rama. Price? $20. U.S. For once I promised myself that I
would be in a &quot;sell&quot; mode. (Stuck to my promise).

DARE ~ to make up your own mind (re: bras)
