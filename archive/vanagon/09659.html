Hi all,

It really was fun, even with the wind, rain, cold, etc. Martha is such an 
organizer. That's was fortunate, since almost everyone else was willing 
to let her make all the critical decisions. The food was GREAT!

The hair dryer in question, although it looked like a Vidal Sasson, was 
actually a DG special. The small electric motor inside most 120V 
dryers is actually a 12 volt DC motor! So, if you rip out all the rectifiers 
inside and wire a 12 volt lighter plug to the motor, you'll have a nifty 
no-heat hair dryer or a fire starter.

Here's my vote for March: Death Valley. It is so beautiful, and not to 
hot until April. Much to see and do and, or course, photograph. The bad 
news: it's a long way from the bay area. I'm not sure just how long it 
would take.
