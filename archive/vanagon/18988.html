Subject: Bentley cost?

In between chasing my 10.5 month old son around the house, I was looking at the
Wolfsberg West catalog that arrived last week and which is only partially
chewed by the baby... anyway (I do have a point, here), do the Bentley books
actually cost about $100? American? That seems pretty expensive -- is that an
inflated price? Thanks!
