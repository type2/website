&gt;rusty, if you don't mind, allow me to butt in.........
&gt;
&gt;tim the table you are referring to is not the spicerack. the spicerack that
&gt;a 65' camper is vastly different from the pull out table that is used on
&gt;the side of a coldbox for a 1971 Campmobile. the spicerack for the 65' was
&gt;desigend to fit on the rear cargo door of the split, it remains stationary
&gt;on the rear cargo door.


OK got it, and yes I have seen a spice rack, in a friends '6x ('62-'66'?) 
flat top Westy. I must ask where he junked it, this was years back however.
