Subject: Re: 83 Vanagon Wobbles

Good point about the &quot;biscuit&quot;  I believe that there are three in the 
Vanagon steering system.  They are reinforced rubber rings about 2.5 
inches in diameter.  One broke on my Vanagon.  The first symptom was a 
thunk and 1/4 turn of the steering wheel with I was parallel parking.  The 
the steering wheel required a half a turn to get the van to change 
direction at all.  I would check these steering system connections, but 
your wobble seems too small compared to the problem that I had for these 
&quot;biscuits&quot; to have broken.
