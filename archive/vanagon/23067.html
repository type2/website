I disagree with Harry on this one.

Even in this ultra cautious litgious society, I've never seens anything 
in any RV owners manual about not travelling with the LP gas on. In fact, 
all of the major refrigerator manufacturers make 2-way propane/LP 
refrigerators which must have the LP gas on to cool when travelling.
