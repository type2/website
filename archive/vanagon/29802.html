Subject:       lighter plug.

I have heard many of you talking about pluging things into the 
cigarret lighter sockets in your buses.  I am either really blind or 
I just dont have one in my '72.  Are they an aftermarket 
only accessory?  if so, where would be the best place to install one 
with out drilling any visible holes?
thanks for any advice.
Ed.
