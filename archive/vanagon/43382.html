Subject: Bleach alert!!!!

&quot;In the RV world they recomend putting chlorine (I use chlorine bleach)
the water and then flushing the tank out good. I think a cup or so in the
tank full of water, let it sit for 30 minutes to kill the germs, drain, 
then
fill and flush twice. Kills bugs dead.&quot;

  This fine advise must not be misread to direct your attention to the 
other often encountered bleach gallon jugs.  Clorox and those identically 
labeled for which you don't subsidize daytime TV programing, are fine.  I 
was told by a health inspector who inspected businesses I owned that it 
was approved for &quot;third tank&quot; sanitizer solution, but the fumes were too 
tough.  BUT, never use the other type.  It's totally unsuitable. It is 
different chemically from Clorox.  I was about to make a stab at giving 
the chemical name, but I'm not sure.  Only use Clorox or identically 
formulated clones.
