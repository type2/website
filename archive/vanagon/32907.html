Subject: 2.0L pancake w/ over 100K won't die   

According to the PO, no major engine work was done between 70K and 120K
(the extent of his ownership). Now, my '77 Camper has 208K with only
regular maintenance. (Surely, this engine had some work at some time ?!)

It runs smoothly: compression is between 127 and 140; I often find 
metallic grit in my used oil...At what compression do these engines start to 
fail ????
