Subject:      What is &quot;Level&quot;?

======== Original Message ========
Instructions for the Dometic refrigerator specify not to operate it unless
it is &quot;level&quot; or damage will occur.  Does anyone know the specifications
for the maximum limit of tilt tolerated?  What damage will occur if the
refrigerator is operated outside these specifications?  Has anyone actually
damaged their refrigerator by running it while their Vanagon is not
&quot;level&quot;?

Most of the information we have on this is very subjective.  If anyone has
any hard data specifications, I'm sure many of us would like to hear them.

Thanks

These are absorption refrigerators and work by a cycle of re-circulating a
fluid of mostly ammonia and water. It needs to be level for the vapors
inside the system to be separated and go their ways to get cold and hot.

The actual cycle is a little complicated but if the fluid  does not
circulate (because the system is not level) there will be no cooling. And
since the thermostat is in the cold area (and never gets cold) it will
constantly be calling for the system to be running. This means that the fan
and heater element (or gas flame) will stay on.

Failure can be in three modes:

1. Electrical heater burns out because of over use.

2. Gas heater fails from overuse. (there are safeties to prevent over
heating)

3. Fluid in the system is damaged by hi temp. the system must then be opened
and recharged.
