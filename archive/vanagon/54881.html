Subject: Re: weird mouse story [F]

Hi all: I thought I would share my dumb mouse story since it's sort of
VW related. For some reason a few months back I had to climb under the
Westy to check something out. It had been raining and the van was
sitting in the driveway, so I went into the shop and looked up onto a 8'
high shelf to find a 2' by 7' piece of carpet that had been rolled up. I
keep a few of these rolls around to lay on in order to stay dry as I
crawl on the ground working on cars. I went out to the Vanagon and
holding one end of the carpet let the roll fall to the ground. When It
unrolled I found that it contained a whole nest of mice. Five or six
mice took off at high speed looking for cover. Now the dumb part. The
Westy was sitting right next to the house so where do you think they
found cover? Yep, they all went straight into the house! Break out the
mouse traps.
