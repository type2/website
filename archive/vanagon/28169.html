&gt; VW may not have put seat belts in but there's NO excuse for not having them
&gt; installed!  It's the lives of your family and yourself that are at stake.

I put them in my '56.  Cost me $23 each (I put 2) and I feel a lot better
about it.  I used to slide all over the place making turns! (new slick
seats)

Now if I could just get the airbag wiring worked out... :)
