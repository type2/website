Tam,

I'm new to the internet and thought that the return address was always 
included in the reply.  I guess I have a lot to learn about the internet.

Our address is smcausla_at_moose.uvn_dot_edu.

A brief call to the state park service informed me that all state park 
campgrounds in Vermont close on Columbus day, October 10th.

However,  he mentioned that there are some private campgrounds open.

Since we just (2 weeks) bought our bus, and most of our camping was done 
in our car, we stuck with state parks.

There are quite a few around the northern part of Lake Champlain.
Mostly on the islalnds of North Hero &amp; South Hero.

Here's some phone  numbers for you.

Appletree Bay Rt2. So. Hero  802-372-5398
Carry Bay                        372-8233
Cedar Ridge KOA                  372-9985
Malletts Bay campground (near Burlington)  863-6980
Pinecrest                  &quot;      &quot;        878-3351
Homestead   Georgia,VT, NE corner of state, very rural and rugged part 
ofVermont, much like Alaska, I'm told.     524-235

 But not to worry, there are several on Rt. 2 and If worse comes to worse 
you can always find a dirt road.
