So Bruce Thacker says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A request for opinions from a newbie. We have recently acquired a '80
&gt; Westphalia. We were told that the starter had been replaced due to 
&gt; starting problems in '93 and a new battery installed the same spring.
&gt; 
&gt; After four hours of highway driving we pulled off for lunch. The van had
&gt; started no prob that morning. There had been negligible current drain while
&gt; driving (i.e., no headlights, etc.) and the water pump was used sparingly
&gt; at lunch. After lunch - no start. The solenoid &quot;clicks&quot; but no start. The
&gt; local town service station came and boosted us for a start and checked the
&gt; battery (nearly fully charged) and the alternator (good output). I checked
&gt; the automatic transmission neutral safety switch on the selector - no prob.
&gt; 
&gt; So what gives? This happened a second time on the trip - fortunately after
&gt; refuelling - the booster was right there and free. Is this a case for Muir's
&gt; &quot;By-pass solenoid&quot;?

Well, I'd first check all of the wire connections especially the main positive
and negative cables.  Make damn good and sure that the ground wire is well
connected to the body with a nice shiny surface to mate with.  Make sure
the integrity of the wires is nothing less than impeccable.  My guess is 
that there is some continuity problem in the wire or the connections that
is preventing the battery from getting a full charge.  

You should also check to see if there are any shorts.  Muir has a nice
simple why of tracking down shorts in the 'Idiot Manual' but it really
helps to have the wiring diagrams to track things down.  Basically your
disconnecting the battery ground cable wire and then slowly touching it 
to the body to see if there's a spark.  If there is then you have a 
short.  Something is draining the battery.  Now, of course, you may 
have some live circuits that are used with the key off so you should 
make sure those are disconnected first.  Like the radio and anything 
else that may be on.  Once the 'live' things are disconnected then do 
the touching of the ground cable thing again.  If you have a spark, you
need to trace down which circuit it's on.  To isolate the circuit, you
remove one fuse at a time and again to the ground cable to body thing
and if no spark happens after the fuse is removed, you then know that
the short is on that circuit.  When you find the circuit with the short
you'll have to look at all the accessories or electrical components on
that branch.  See if there is a wire or piece that is loose or touching
ground.  When you find it.  Fix it and recheck for any other shorts.

Let me know if you have more questions,

Steven
