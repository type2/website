&gt;The new speed limits out here in California have proven to be
&gt;a mixed blessing; while its nice to be able to go faster, yada yada
&gt;yada, it has significantly eroded my margin of comfort on
&gt;the freeways.  I live in the right lane, but occassionally I
&gt;could slideover a lane or two as the need arose, because I had
&gt;the 15mph reserve to do so.  Now I have to use that 15mph
&gt;&quot;reserve&quot; just to keep up!  I hear they're renaming the right
&gt;hand lane the &quot;Thom&quot; lane...  Anyone else having similar problems?


I used to drive 60-65 in either my '71 Bus or my '66 Mustang
Coupevertible. I usually stayed in the right lane.

The new speed limits haven't made any apparent difference to me. In fact,
if I'm in the slow lane, I can go 50 if I want to, though I wouldn't
recommend it. It's up to the speedsters to watch out, and if you need to
move to the next (left) lane over, check if you've got enough distance
from cars overtaking you in that lane, and go for it. If they happen to
be doing 90, it's their problem, not yours. That's what that pedal to the
left of their accelerator is for.

Yes, it's dangerous. They told me in high school Driver Ed that driving was
like that. If I'm doing 55 and the guy coming up behind is doing 65, he
has room to change lanes himself or slow down if I've done my lane change
right... which I have, BTW. I'll stay in the new lane only long enough to
get by the big semi, and then get back in the rightmost lane. If there are
several other people around driving as I do, then yes, the 65'er might
actually have to slow down to 55 for 30 seconds or so. Sorry... that's life.
The condition is temporary.

And if the guy coming up behind is doing 90, yup, there could be a
slam-banger in the works. Uh, that's why the speed limit is there, guys.

But I guess I won't be leaving the freeway because of the risks from
the occasional abuser, despite the fact that it's more dangerous because
of them. Life gets that way occasionally. But the dweebs aren't worth the
trouble they cause. The good news ia, when you pull out 200 yards in front
of them, they usually don't hit you. In fact, None has ever hit me, despite
my doing this for many moons. Sure, they get pissed off, but that's their
problem, and frankly they deserve it-- tough.

On non-freeway roads, it's a different matter, especially when there's
only one lane going your way. I pull over occasionally to let the people
behind me get by-- if I'm driving my '71 Bus, I wasn't in that much of a
hurry anyway. I've seen others do this too-- kudos, you drivers out there!
You know who you are.

As for the ones doing 20 in the only lane WITHOUT ever pulling over, while
50 cars pile up behind you and passing one at a time, well, no, you are
not breaking any laws (well, in CA actually you are). But how about an
ounce of courtesy to avoid a ton of inconvenience, hmmm? You're giving the
rest of us a bad name, even if you're driving a Ford, Toyota, or whatever.

Look around you, guys. Be courteous. Don't be a dweeeb simply because
there's no specific law against it, OK?

End soap box mode (aka dweeb mode).
