Well, I drug the '54 out into the cold this morning to ponder my insanity.

I poked around at various bits, cleaned some stuff up, just gawked at it in 
general. 

Steve Johnson came by a while later to gawk too, and together we gawked like
no tomorrow.

I went and bought several cans of liquid wrench and went crazy.  I managed to
get the fake semaphores off and the sunroof open.

I wish I had a bus with a solid bottom, so I could just cut both busses all 
the way around about 12&quot; up, and drop my bus on the good underbelly.  No
wait, that won't work 'cause this one's right hand drive!

Steve kept teasing me, getting me to slip up when he referred to the 
&quot;passenger&quot; and &quot;driver's&quot; sides!
