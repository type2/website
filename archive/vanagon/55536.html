Subject: squeaking bushings

Hello fellow Vanagoners!

I've been following the postings about passenger side squeaky upper 
control arm bushings, a problem that I have as well...my local repair 
shop tells me that the bushings are about 35 bucks apiece and the 
labor to install them brings the damage to about 200 bucks. Does this 
seem reasonable? I've always had good experiences with them, is this 
a job that is best done in the shop? They tell me the problem is 
mostly just the annoyance factor right now but that eventually it 
will effect the handling, in about six months, Thanks for any advice,
Rick
