&gt;&gt; &gt;POSTAGE:
&gt;&gt; &gt; for up to 7 stickers, use one 32-cent stamp
&gt;&gt; &gt; for 8-15, use two 32-cent stamps
&gt;&gt; &gt; and add stamps for additional stickers.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Non-USA orders, please send an extra $3.00 for postage. (in USA cash)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hmm, let's see, 32 cents for a stamp, but send $3.00 for postage. &quot;Poor
&gt;&gt; Richard&quot; won't be poor for long. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Richard, perhaps you should rephrase that to &quot;overseas orders&quot;, because,
&gt;&gt; Canada just happens to be stuck on your northern frontier and isn't as
&gt;&gt; furrin' as you may think. Typically, postage costs more between Canada &amp;
&gt;&gt; the U.S., but usually in the order of 20 cents, or maybe two first class
&gt;&gt; stamps, I do not remember, but cetainly not $3.00.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How about if the Canadians sent you a self addressed envelope and a US buck
&gt;&gt; for postage? Sound fair?

I know that here in Canada we can buy a coupon that Canada Post says is
honored by any country's postal service for mailing to Canada.  The problem
is that you have to go to a US Post Office to exchance it for a stamp (and
then I guess US Post gets money for it from Canada Post).  I can see that it
would be a pain in the bus to go to the post office with 123 of these from
18 different countries.
