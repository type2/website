Subject:      Re: low oil warning light/buzzer

My '87 Syncro does the same thing.  On for a couple of blocks, just to REALLY
get me attention, then off.  I've been using Castrol GTX 20W-50 in the summer
and 3W-30 in the winter.

&lt;&lt; My 86 Synchro runs well but has a small quirk.  About 10-30 seconds after
a
 cold start (at temperatures under about 60 F) the oil warning light/buzzer
 come on for a block or two.  They then go off and are not heard from again.
  This happens about half the time, with no discernible pattern.
 Occasionally while driving the oil light will come on for a few seconds
 (without the buzzer) and then go off.   The oil level is full and oil and
 filter are changed at 3-4000 miles with Valvoline 10-40.  Is this a
 possible problem with an oil pump or just an electical gremlin?  Should I
 have an oil pressure test done?  Any help will be appreciated. &gt;&gt;
