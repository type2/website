Subject: Re:  Tranny Support

The problem with VW was (and probably still is,) that some years they
supported the tranny, some years they didn't.  Here are the years:

Up to '67:  Rear Lower Cradle with two mounts, same as the Bug thru '72

68-71:  Transmission unsupported except by way offf the engine rear carrier
mount.  This is why you have to support the tranny when removing and
re-installing the engine with a strap, chain, etc.

72-79:  VW got smart again - Transmission is supported by an upper Rear
Cradle with two bonded rubber mounts - they look like bushings (Trivia - VW
obsoleted these two years ago :(  ).

80-91:  VW got DUMB again - Tranny once again supported by the engine (except
maybe Syncro, I didn't check that fiche).

Wish they'd make up my mind :)
