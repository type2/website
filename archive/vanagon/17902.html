&gt; It's a pity Richard Palmer is not goig to join GNATT.
&gt; 
&gt; I expect it's going to be a pleasurable trip.
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun Richard, where evr you are and go~~
&gt; 
Since I will be probably missing most of GNATT, Iam going to try to set
up a big east coast thing sometime in late June or so. This time, I
expect A LOT of us to show up!!!!!!!!!!
:)
Anyway, more on that when I return...
