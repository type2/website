Subject: Re: 19 or 23 window Bus wanted

&gt;I'm looking for a split for a good friend.It must have the overhead
windows,sun-
&gt;roof and wrap-around rear windows.Also; no rust or rust repair and preferrably
&gt;on the east coast(though not imperative) He's willing to pay absolute top
dollar
&gt;for the right one.All responses will be considered. What do we have out
there folks?

You are looking for a 23-window deluxe, made up to 1963.
