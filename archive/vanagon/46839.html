Subject: Pop Top Seals..Hurrah!

        Just thought Id post a quick note about my recent experience with
new pop top seal. I was actually going to get the luggage rack seal as well
but it woulda put me over budget.....which is weird since I always go over
budget, but this time I stopped myself since I'll be leaving on my 2 week
Vanagon trip in a week and a half now. I have a sneaking suspicion that I
may need that money, but hopefully not for any van repairs.
        Anyhow, I purchasedit for $99.00 + shipping from California Imports
out in BC. It was here in 3 days (the same day as my Bentley...hurrah
again). I had already cleaned and prepped the pop top the previous week
really well with a utility knife to trim off all the stuck on garbage, and
then with a scrub pad and some hot soapy water.
        All that was left to do was to throw on some adhesive, which they
recommended 3M adhesive for but I couldnt find so I ended up buying some
generic goop at Canadian Tire for $5. It was kinda tricky putting on the
adhesive since the seal lip was so skinny, it just meant I had to have a
rag with me to wipe up any glue smears pronto. The aluminium seal went on
great, really snug, and that was pretty much it. I took a peice of wood and
a rubber mallet to the seal to make sure it was as snug as could be, and
let er dry.
        It looks great compared to the rotting old one that was there, but
now the luggage rack will meed one. But that can wait till I return.

the kindergarten mechanic. (no its not some wierd pedophelia thing, it just
refers to my very limited knowledge of vechicles)

PS : I've collected 6 waves this week. 4 from older buses, 2 from what
looked to be newer than 89.
        Average age was probably about 28. I havent seen to many people
younger than myself (22)                      driving many yet this summer.
