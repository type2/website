Subject: Re: Stupic Ignorant Question

Tonya asked about diagnosing voltage problems, and Gregory M Daughtry
posted a reply suggesting using a multimeter on AMPS scale to check for
current leaks.  A simple way to approximate this if one doesn't have a
multimeter is to use a 12V lamp and socket with pigtail leads ala John
Muir's static timing light.  Place the lamp in series with the lead to
be checked ie battery ground strap and see if the lamp glows or
illuminates when ignition and all devices are off. If it does, proceed
to remove fuses one at a time until the lamp is extinguished.  You've
then found the circuit which is causing the current drain.  Same concept
can be applied using the lamp in place of the fuse while individual
components are disconnected one at a time.  HTH.
