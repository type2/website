&gt;     Thanks for the reply, it's nice to hear from someone who actually has 
&gt;     one. This sounds like their more expensive closed loop system. Do you 
&gt;     have the cat. converter?

No I don't. 
&gt;     
&gt;     My 1776cc is a type 1, I forget whether a 71 bus is Type 1 engine or 
&gt;     Type 4. If type 1, did you have to modify the heads for a temp sensor? 
&gt;     Any other engine mods or was it basically bolt on plus wiring and 
&gt;     running fuel lines?
&gt;     
	
'71 is the last upright in a bus. I had to drill and tap the head for a temp 
sensor -- next to the #4 exhaust so that the sensor is in the valve galley -- 
near the #4 exhaust valve spring. 

Basically bolt-in. Biggest issues are where/how to mount things and where to 
return fuel. 

	Fuel return - My first try at return was the defunct fuel vent -- bad move -- 
pressure build up cause gas tank leak. 		I now have it mounted in filler neck 
and restored the vent system.
	ECU - Under seat storage area.
	MAP sensor - on fan housing
	Fuel Pump - in engine compartment on l/h side with clamps.

&gt;     The new supply line is 1/2&quot;, is that ID or OD? Is the return line also 
&gt;     1/2&quot;?
&gt;     

ID -- it's a big mother -- it goes into an in-line fuel pump ~1.5&quot; diam. x 6 &quot; 
long. the outlet is 1/4&quot; that runs to 3 &amp; 	4 injectors then to 1 &amp; 2 
injectors, then to a pressure regulator and finally returns to tank.

&gt;     I'm not that familiar with busses, is that mileage less, about the 
&gt;     same, or more than stock?
&gt;


Better than the Kadron's that I was using -- 14-15 city, 17-18 highway -- 
remember that this is an 1835 and a heavy camper (~3500 lbs) -- plus I pass 
smog. I used to have to retrofit my old PICT to barely pass.
 
&gt;     Were the 48mm the only ones offered when you got it or did you chose 
&gt;     them over the 40mm? Do the 48's seem about right for the engine or are 
&gt;     they overkill for that size?
&gt;     

There all that were offered in duals. They do have a single center mount 
throttle body -- don't know what size -- but I was told that what I have would 
run best on my engine.
