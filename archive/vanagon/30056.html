Hi,

I was wondering:  since Kombis don't have the heater under the back seat,
has anyone here done any sort of &quot;adaptation&quot; in order to get heat in the 
back?  I was thinking about drilling into the exposed portion of the
heater pipe and &quot;tapping&quot; in with a short section of hose, across the bottom
of the westy bed and to small holes in the front of the bed.  I get
plenty of heat up front, and I'd like to share the wealth with the
back of the bus.

Well? (I know, deep subject...)

Thom
