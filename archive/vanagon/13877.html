Subject: Re: Drove my '66 - Brakes pulling


&gt;a pull to the right big time.  When I first would hit the break it would
&gt;pull hard, but then brake straight (in the new direction, of course).  I

I had a similar situation, where it would pull, then go straight.  I was 
told that it was due to the degradation inside the brake line rubber hoses, 
i.e. a swelling would constrict the fluid getting to the brakes.  A related 
problem was that it would then pull when I released the brake pedal until 
the fluid got back past the constriction.  Replaced the rubber brake lines - 
fixed it.

I really like this list!!!  Unfortunately it has reminded me of all the 
things I have had to repair on the bus :-(   - Oh well....
