They are made by Doduco in germany - they call the thing 'Intervall CHIP'-
got mine _at_ New Dimensions for ~$30 ea.  They fit the Vanagonner, the 
phoney GTI, _not_ the '77 Ribbit.  Also fits various Alfas, Audis, Saabs, 
Porsches, etc.  (on the back it lists what lokks to be a VW part # - to 
whit, 191 955 531A, which is what it supposedly replaces).
