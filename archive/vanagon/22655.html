&gt; Howdy All,
&gt; 	Finally I found a yard with numerous VWs in my area (Long Island). 
&gt; It's called Gerts (he has a shop too) and he's really cool.  He must have about
&gt; ten busses/campers scattered around and he let me owe him $2 for a curtain rod
&gt; I needed for my '73.

&gt; 	Okay, he wants about $400.  I think this is pretty cheap, but I have no
&gt; clue how much bodywork costs these days, anyone out there have experience with
&gt; this type of work.  Could I do it myself (I've learned to do everything else)? 
&gt; Of course, I wouldn't decide definitely before I take a good look at the
&gt; underbody and behind the stainless steel stuff.
&gt; 	Would I just be better off waiting for a rustless one to come along
&gt; (lots of $$$$?) or should I get this promising (?) project? (that is, of
&gt; course, once I finish my '73 in a couple of weeks).
&gt; 	Thanks for your time,
&gt; Erik.

How come all these apparent good deals aren't mine.  I think I'd drive up 
there for that deal.
