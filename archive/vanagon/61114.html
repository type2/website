Subject: Eurovan gage fix

The problem with the Eurovans gages is the voltage stabilizer (VS). It a
small three terminal device in the instriment cluster. It converts 12 VDC to
10 VDC. This way even though the system drops from 12.5 to 11.8 during heavy
electrical use the gages stay accurate. Except on Eurovans. There is a minor
problem in that the connection to the VS gets bad. Then the gas and temp
gages read badly. Here is what I did:

1. Disconnect the ground strap from the battery. Yes do this.
2. Pull the cover off the center of the steering wheel.
3. Remove the steering wheel.
4. Remove the steering column covers (three screws, two parts)
5. Disconnect and remove the steering column switches.
6. Remove the screws holding the cluster bezel (two screws under cluster    
  overhang)
7. Remove the bezel.
8. Open fuse cover, reach in and and disconnect the spedo cable.
9. remove the upper screw on either side of the instruments ( the lower ones
      hold on the clear plastic thing)
10. Pull out the cluster slightly and disconect the plug. Remove the        
cluster.
11. Remove the other two screws from the sides of the cluster. Remove the   
     clear plastic thing.
12. Remove the instruments. They just pull off.
13. Remove any screws that hold done the circuit board to the white plastic 
       housing.
14. Remove the screw that holds down the VS.
15. Remove the circiut board. Tabs hold it in.
16. Pull the VS out if its socket. Clean the three wires off with tuner    
cleaner.
17. Put the VS back in its socket. Be sure that its in the correct position
to be installed. Try it then remove it again.
18 With a small soldering iron and the correct solder solder the very ends
of the VS terminals to the socket contacts. 

Put everything back together. Works good? No. It worked for me. Where do I
send the flowers?
