Hi all again. The Westy went to get moved, so I can snow blow the driveway
again. This time I noticed on the fresh fallen snow lots of black soot
coming from the tailpipe. Lots. Joel W. thought it might be a bad injector.
Any other thoughts? My mileage has also gone down greatly the last few
days, since this this problem. if it is an injector should this faint
hearted science teacher attempt it? Thanks all.
        Mike E.
