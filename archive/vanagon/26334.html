Subject: Re: /f in Defense of Spam



&gt;&gt; wonder who ever thought up Spam? and why?  every wonder why you don't 
have
&gt;&gt; chicken spam? or fish spam? or pork spam?  (actually, the army had some
&gt;stuff
&gt;
&gt;..Spicken..........Spish.........Spork?  What about Speef? or Spurkey?
&gt;Spalmon and Speal for the richer among us...  Spofu for the Vegetarians...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; in c-rations that was pretty close to pork spam ... with a lot of tabasco
&gt;&gt; sauce, it wasn't tooooo bad. just couldn't take those Ham and MF's, 
though!)
&gt;&gt; ;)

In the modern era, those C-rats are referred to officially as MRE's, for
&quot;Meal, Ready to Eat&quot;.

Among the people who actually have to eat them (I had the pleasure more
than once in Thule, Greenland), this is called &quot;Three lies for the price
of one&quot;.
