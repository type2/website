&gt;For used Campers try the link

&gt;'REIMO-Reisemobilcenter'

&gt;and in this page

&gt;'Gebrauchtwagen'

&gt;This site seems to be under construction. I
&gt;got a Transfer Interruption and I can't find
&gt;the link to the EV any more. Therefore the
&gt;pictures for Mercedes are correct. I have to
&gt;watch it or will do a FTP to my own server.

&gt;Thanks to Larry!

Last update?

The still working URL is:

http://www_dot_camping-online_dot_de/reimo

Notice, REIMO has to be written in small letters.
Thanks to Kenyon!

On this URL the links to the EV are working. The URL
http://www.mosoft.dsn_dot_de/camping/reimo/ seems to be
the previous version.
