&gt;Yep, &quot;Black Bear Road&quot; is on one of my favorite drivin' CDs called something
&gt;like &quot;C.W. McCall, Greatest Hits&quot; that I picked up about 3 years ago when I was
&gt;camped in Ouray, Colorado.  (The guy who sang the songs was mayor of Ouray
&gt;for a number of years.)  This contains the most recently redone versions
&gt;of some of C.W.'s most famous songs like &quot;Wolf Creek Pass&quot;,&quot;The Silverton&quot;,
&gt;&quot;Convoy&quot;, &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;, and &quot;Columbine&quot;.  Doesn't have another one of my

&gt;(you remember that one? went sumpthin like,  
&gt;&quot;I was thumbin' through the want ads in the Shelby county tribune, when
&gt;this classified advertisement caught my eye, it said 'take immediate delivery
&gt;on this '57 Chevrolet half ton pickup truck, will sell or swap for a hide-a-bed

And did you know that C.W. McCall got smacked upside the head, discovered
New Age Music, and went on to create Mannheim Steamroller????


&gt;Sorry Gerry, no VW content yet.  Well, here's a little.

Sorry again, Gerry, still no VW content, but Mannheim IS in Germany, no?
