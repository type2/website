Subject: RE:  Diesel Transmission


Paul:

I've had excellent luck with German Transaxle of America.  It's about $1000
to overhaul your transmission, but they have an excellent warrenty and have
been great to work with.

By the way the 5 speed transmissions are virtually unabtainable in this country.

I do have a query for the list.  I have the option of having a syncro
locker installed in my transmission for abouyt the same price as the Weddle
Locker.
Any comments regarding installing this locker on a 2-wheel drive vanagon?

Fred
