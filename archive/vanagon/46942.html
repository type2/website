Subject: Re: What's the deal with naval jelly???

I believe that naval jelly is some kind of acid  (oxalic???) it causs a
chemical reaction that converts the ferrous oxide into ferric oxide, this is
nert. You must have a rusty surface for it to work and as long as the
reaction goes down to the bare metal you will have no problems.
