Subject: Clutch Nightmare 86'

Please help, why are these things so picky?
Are the cheap ($60) Mexican clutch disc as good as the ($300) VW parts?
Has anybody noticed a difference?

I've had to put four or five disc and I think 2 pressure plates in my '86.
It had 80,000 when I got it and it now has 210,000 miles (oh yea, replaced 
the transmission one of those times $2000.00 ouch).  Well, its dying 
again, slipping on an irregular basis, maybe the engine oil seal again, 
and I think the hydraulic cylinder, buried somewhere under the dash is 
dying.

I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone has on replacing this part.  
My guess is it's a nightmare.  Also, any other general advice you have on 
this system would be helpful.

Thanks,

Trace
