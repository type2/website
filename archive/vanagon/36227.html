&gt;I went to the DMV in 1984 to register a '70 bug that I had purchased
&gt;that had Missouri plates on it.
   &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;The number under the back seat was a '69 serial number, completely 
different
&gt;from the '70 id plate.
   &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;BTW, the VIN on the plate by the
&gt;spare tire was the same as the one at the windshield.

Hmmm... your tax dollars at work.

When I lived in Minnesota (if you think they use a lot of salt in the
East, then you haven't been to Minnesota), swapping bug bodies from one
chassis to another was common, especially when one chassis had rusted
out. I owned a car there that was a '69 convertible body on a '73 bug
sedan chassis, with dual-port engine. It had the same mismatched numbers
you describe, but I was fortunate enough to avoid inspectors-- besides,
I had *both* titles.

Any chance that bug you had, was a chassis-swap special?

I'm considering selling tickets to the show when I go to register the
V6anagon. Any takers?   :^)
