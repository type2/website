When shoes are remanufactured, they're typically built up with a little
more material, i.e. oversized.  However, I've never seen a set of shoes
specifically designated as such.

&gt;   shoes, they just give me puzzled looks.
&gt;  
&gt;   Do &quot;oversize&quot; shoes really exist?  Are they really necessary? &gt;&gt;

&gt; Not any more and the thin drums will warp.
