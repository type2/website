As I was driving back from San Francisco this past Sunday, I paused at a
rest stop on I-5, just about 50 miles South of the Bay area, for a quick
catnap.  I pulled into a parking spot next to a 4 wheel drive van that
was rather unusual.  It was painted primer gray, registered in British
Columbia, was raised a good two feet above normal, with monster
mud-bogger tires, and had some funky custom taillights installed, and no
rear windows.  A short time later I heard him pull out - he seemed to
have major problems getting it into gear.  I forgot about it until just
now at lunch, when I was driving down to the local Subway sandwich shop
here in San Diego.  Lo and behold, this *same* van passes me!  And I'm
out on the Point Loma peninsula - not exactly a common destination in
San Diego.  That was just too wierd, and I had to share it with you all.
Anyone else seen this guy cruising around??  

Oh, I guess I need some VW content here, huh?  I was up in the Bay area
because I had just bought a 2 liter Vanagon engine from Mike Catlin in
Davis, and was bringing it home.  I'm getting ready to transfer the guts
(crank, rods, cam, pistons, cylinders) into another case and install the
whole schebang into DaBoat!  More on that later...
