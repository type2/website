Subject: Hello!

Hello all, I am glad to find your list.  I am the very happy owner of a 93
EuroVan GL with 44K miles on it.  I used to have a 1989 Vanagon GL Wolfsburg
which was another great van.  You'll probably think I'm pretty stupid, but
since 1989-present, I thought that my Vanagon had Syncro on it, when the
entire time it didn't.  &quot;SyncroHead&quot; from your list set me straight.

Overall, my VW vans have impressed me and my wife immensely.  We've owned
four, from the first '84 Dodge Caravan, to the current '93 EuroVan.  None
were as good as my VW's.  The Caravan, was a neat van, but build quality was
deplorable, always in for service on minor things that kept breaking.  The
next van was far worse.  The '87 Ford Aerostar XLT was a overpriced pile of
junk.  It had all these ridiculous Electronic gizmos that ALL broke.  The van
had major engine problems that occured frequently and weren't covered by
warranty.  After two years we had had enough and bought our first VW, the
Vanagon.  The Vanagon GL Wolfsburg (which I always thought had Syncro!) was
really great.  Lots of room for such a small size, comfortable, and had great
handling (better than my EV).  The European styling appealed to my wife and
I, even though it was boxy.  It had low profile tires, glossy paint, and nice
rocker pannels on the bottom of the van that gave it an agressive look.  We
NEVER had a problem with it and it was a great touring van.  The EuroVan is
noisier than the Vanagon and doesn't handle as well, but we have enjoyed it
as much.

Are there anymore EV owners out there, and does anyone have info on upcoming
1997 EV passenger models?

Any info would be great,

Chris
