              general overhaul question and paint color question.

&gt; First. My '81 Vanagon is going to get a new 2L long-block from GEK (sp?) as

&gt; this companies engines?

I replaced my '81's engine with a GEX a little over 12,000 miles ago and
its run OK.  If I had it to do over again I probably wouldn't go with GEX
as this engine has some things that trouble me, and one specific issue
(low compression on #3) was never addessed by GEX although I emailed them
a couple of times.


&gt; Also, since I am replacing the engine, can anyone
&gt; suggest what else I could/should do as a matter of general principle? This
&gt; volks has 131K miles. As far as I know, everything (except the exhaust and
&gt; brakes) is stock and original. Before dying, this van ran great.

Clean tin, give all vacuum lines a good test, consider replacing clutch
(depending on milage on these components), replace engine compartment
seal if necessary.

&gt; Second, in looking for touch-up paint I went directly to a VW dealership. I
&gt; thought this was a no brainer, as the van is a two-tone (yellow lower, cream
&gt; upper). The dealer told me NO '81 vanagon was painted those colors. In fact,
&gt; they told me the only color combination used was two-tone, brown/tan in that
&gt; year. I am pretty sure the paint is stock and original. Any comments?

Your van is the same color as mine.  Once again a VWofA dealer gets it wrong.
