Subject:  RE: Alloy wheel deal

&gt; It's easy enough, 
&gt;I'll call and find the offset of the Audi wheels, Germans cast it 
&gt;into all alloys as an ET number, ET38 fi is a 38mm offset.
&gt;Van wheel offset escapes me but will be easy enough to measure.  
&gt;Anything fairly close (within 10mm or so) is largely acceptable 

Actually, a little more than 10mm is sufficient too, because it does work. 

Audi 5000/200 turbo alloy wheel:   6Jx15 H2 ET45

Vanagon &quot;Carat&quot; 5 spoke alloy wheel: 6Jx14 H2 ET30
