Subject: Re: picture of VW Sharan

&gt;&gt; And speaking of VR6 in vans, I've been poking around under the hood of my EV
&gt;&gt; and I think they're going to have to make some major mods to get that thing
&gt;&gt; in there.  I know its a compact mill(I had a Passat with the VR6), but the
&gt;&gt; EV engine compartment is designed around that 5cyl at an angle. Nothing like
&gt;&gt; a Passat or Golf compartment.  I wouldn't be surprised to see either some
&gt;&gt; slight intrusion into the passenger compartment or a slightly longer front
&gt;&gt; end to accomodate the VR6.  I guess we'll find out next spring!
&gt;
&gt;I thought just the Sharan was getting the VR6?  Are they planning it 
&gt;for the Eurovan as well?
&gt;

It's supposed to be in the EV sometime in the spring.  Regular 5cyl models
are due back with the 96 model year.
