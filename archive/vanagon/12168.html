Subject: Add. Cooling Fan


When browsing through the JCWITHNEY catalog (and also in a shelf in one 
of the local supply shops) I saw these electric cooling fans 
(thermostatically controlled) that you can attach to the radiator (and 
even disable the belt-driven fans, YES thats what they say; CAVE, only 
for watercooled engines). 

(1) Has anybody tried to install one of these fans (10.5 - 12&quot; diameter) in 
an aircooled Vanagon, for example by covering the outlet (in the engine 
compartment) of the left rear 'air tunnel'; 

(2) What would be a good location to install the thermo element/sensor
(operating range is approx. 180 - 250 Degrees F.; in watercooled engines 
this is supposed to be stuck between the metal radiator ribs....)
