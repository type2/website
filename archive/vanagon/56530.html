&gt; Does anyone know where I could pick up a second hand service manual that
&gt; covers a 86 Vanagon GL? I am also looking for any suggestions that anyone
&gt; might have to increase my gas mileage. I have already put new plugs, wires,
&gt; cap, rotor, fuel filter, and had the fuel system set. The mechanic said
&gt; that my OXS sensor is not functioning, but also said that this won't have a
&gt; whole lot of effect after the engine is warm and that he adjusted the
&gt; system to compensate so I shouldn't need to replace it. Is this true?


Replace your OXS, it will affect you MPG.  Check the archives about
this.
