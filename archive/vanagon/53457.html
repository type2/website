&gt;Questions:
&gt;1.  My clutch master cylinder is leaking internally.  There is a small
&gt;amount of corrosion about half way down the bore.  When I push
&gt;the clutch, the transmission engages slowly as the master cylinder loses
&gt;pressure.  I think it is caused by the master cylinder.  I took the clutch
&gt;slave cylinder and it looked fine with no external leaking.  Has every bodies
&gt;experience been that it is usually the master cylinder??
&gt;Can these be rebuilt??  Whom do you think has the best price for a new one??
&gt;2.  How do I drain the oil from the transmission??  I see a plug right by
&gt;the shift linkage but I don't know if this is the drain.  There is a plastic
&gt;cap on the top of the transmission.  I need a clue.  
The clutch master cylinder is rebuild able. But, the if the rust leaves too
much pitting you may not be able to reuse the cylinder.
The transmission drain is in the center bottom of the transmission. It is
pointing at an approximate 45 degree angle towards the back. The plug by
the shifter is the fill hole. 
I recently had to replace my input shaft on my trans. I knew the input
shaft seal was leaking and when I pulled it the pilot bearing was shot and
it ruined the shaft. I figured I better check the breather while it was out
and it was plugged tight. Took a small piece of stiff wire and cleaned it
out. Got to let them rascals breathe. HTH
