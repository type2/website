Subject: /f talking 'bout LAAAARGE engines (non VW)

I always knew that Mercedes has good sized engines, but this ad in the local
newspaper beats everything:

*********************************
1972 Mercedes 350SLC
450 liter engine, sun roof
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
4 seater, $ 4995, (916) 758-7294
*********************************

so when they really push down on the accelerator, the passengers will get
sucked out through the sunroof! I don't want to know about the gas mileage
that they get...
