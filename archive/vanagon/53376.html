Subject: Lighting - HighPower Bulbs

Further to the recent thread on lighting, I thought
that I would report to the list on my experience using
(illegal) 80W/100W 9004 bulbs in my Eurovan/Winnebago.

Having had the pleasure of Bosch 100W H3 driving lights
perched on the front bumper of my 1988 Westfalia, I was
disappointed in the original equipment lamps on the 
Eurovan.  The housing was designed for the American-style
9004 bulb, rather than the European H4.  I despaired of
finding a brighter bulb.

JCW to the rescue.  Noticing 'off-road&quot; 9004s rated at 
80W/100W, I cajoled a States-side friend into obtaining
a pair for me.

Well, here's the report.  

Brightness - excellent - usually ran at 80% power setting
Longevity - poor - one dead at 6 months, the second at 10 months
Suitability - poor - the power connector on both sides is 
now a honey colour, rather than the original white

Now, can anyone suggest how to fit driving lights to the
front of a Eurovan, given the &quot;integral&quot; nature of the
bumper design?  BTW, I also run a bra.
