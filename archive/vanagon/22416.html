Hey now,
        A bittersweet day.

        Upon investigation, and after many useful suggestions from all you
kind folk out there, I found that my CV's had in fact bit the dust. 2 were
toast to be exact-little pieces of metal flying around in there-no es muy
bueno. Got the new ones yesterday, and put 'em on this morning. That's the
last time I try to deal with circlips without the right tools. The
screwdriver method worked OK to get the dammed things off, but they were a
real pain in the butt to get back on. It's all greased and running great
now, but I was called into work early, so the new header &amp; muffler will
have to go on Friday. Also repalced the shocks while I was down there, and
now my bus rides great! Gonna have to replace the front shocks when I get
the dough.

        That was the sweet part, the bitter was upon my arrival at work,
when my boss informed me of Jerry's demise. I'd thought he was pulling my
leg at first, 'cause he had me going on the same story about 6 mos. ago,
and I bought it. When he said it this time I just shrugged it off, not sure
if I could believe him. Upon confirmation, I am still in a bit of shock. My
'70 has seen the lot scene, and I consider myself something of a veteran of
the shows. I am saddend to think that those great happy gatherings of
machines and men will likely no longer take place. My bus also has many of
the obligatory dead and social protest stickers. I know that many deadheads
hve pondered through St. Muir on the side of the road, so I feel a kinship.
And I still remeber that fellow in the '66 splittie that pulled over on the
way home from Vegas last year to help with my blown out tire-I'd been
stopped for almost 5 minutes when he came along. Try THAT in a Chevy after
ANY other concert. And get ready to shell out $75+ for a tow truck.

        For those who are displeased with my dead posting, please
understand that I too feel that the dead and busses are related-I was a
deadhead before my bus, and if not for the dead I most likely would not
have fallen in love with the VW. &quot;Goin' down the road feelin' bad&quot;.

Peace,
