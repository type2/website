Subject: RE: What would you do?

Galactic James Lu asks what to do instead of $1200 head gaskets.  Dave will
apparently disassemble a van, pass it thru a 6 inch hole, and rebuild it, for
$2500 or so.  Sounds like he pays himself $0.35 an hour for garage work, just
like I do.  With 113k on the engine, and assuming the rest of the van was
worth it, I would get a new long block, paying more than $1200 but less than
a good used car.

What do you suppose the consensus is about 83s with bad head gaskets over on
the Chevette list?
