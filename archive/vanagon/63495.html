&gt; I've read the archives on intermittent missing, and wonder if there is
&gt; anything anyone can add. This isn't the kind of cutting out that makes me stop
&gt; by the side of the road.  It only lasts a second or so and then starts up.

Gerry:

I had this same problem for awhile.  Finally tracked it down to a loose 
connection in the LT circuit of the ignition system.  It was one of those 
spade connections that lives inside a little plastic box.  Road vibration 
would sometimes jiggle things enough that the van would cut-out and 
stumble for a second or two, but then vibration would bring the 
connection back into contact and the engine would run smoothly.

Recommend that you go through the engine and disconnect/connect all 
electrical connections.  Since you recently had the engine out (I assume) 
this loose connection situation sounds like a real possibility.
