Subject: Re: Mo' gas

&gt;In preparation for my trip to Kansas City to deliver Bob Polys' engine, I
&gt;swung by the gas station this afternoon and took on 33 gallons of fuel,
&gt;$49.83.  The cashier became increasingly nervous as the numbers clicked up on
&gt;the pump.  When I was done she she said &quot;I didn't think Volkswagen's held
&gt;that much.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I have to go to Kansas City.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Oh....  &quot; looking very puzzled.
&gt;
&gt;(I guess you had to be there :-)

Wish I was!

Sounds like a perfect line to be delivered deadpan.
