Subject: Getting A Key Cut From The Lock Code - '65 Type II

Does anyone have any experience getting a key cut from the code on a
1965 Type II ignition switch?

I have a 1967 Type II with the ignition key broken off in the
ignition.  The stub of the key will still turn the switch so I can use
the bus but I have been looking for a replacement switch.  Recently I
bought a bunch of used split-window bus parts and found what I believe
is a 1965 ignition switch.  It has a code stamped on it so I hope I can
find a locksmith that has VW codes.

On a similar subject has anyone used the information in the Bentley
manual to move tumblers around to get locks to match?  Are the tumbler
sets mentioned still availible?

I am interested in trying first to get a working ignition switch then
get all of the doors in the bus keyed the same.  After I finish it's
restoration I will want it to lock up as tight as possible.
