Subject: Re:  'extended life' coolants

It'll all have leaked out, resulting in a complete changover in 2 yrs.  ;-)
 
 &gt;New GM vehicles come with a (claimed) 100k/5yr coolant they call 'Dex-Cool';
 &gt;I've just discovered Prestone &quot;Extended Life - 5/100&quot; coolant that notes on
 &gt;the bottle that it is Dex-Cool compatable, &amp; silicate and phosphate free.
 &gt;(~ $8/gal _at_ Pep Boys).  It's a vile, bile yellow color, same as the GM
 &gt;stuff, for what it's worth.  Any comments pro / con from the truely
 &gt;knowledgeable out there ref using this stuff &amp; maybe going 2-3 years between
 &gt;coolant changes?
