Subject: Introductions, Garcia, &amp; School Buses...

Howdy, all!  I've lurked long enough and have decided to come out into 
the open!  My name's Jason Smith and I have a 1973 Sportsmobile Camper 
that I've fixed up a bit over the 3-4 years I've owned her.  I had been 
on the list a while back, but I had to unsubscribe when I moved.  It's 
good to be back!

On Jerry Garcia......I always find it amusing that people see my Bus 
and automatically equate it with the Grateful Dead.  I was fortunate 
enough to see the Band in concert just a couple of times before Jerry 
passed away.  If you've never been to a show, it's not something I 
could explain, but those that have will know what an experience it was. 
And this was all without the benefit of a single chemical substance!  
Anyway, sorry to ramble....

On school buses....Claraw_at_aol_dot_com, you mentioned you saw a school bus 
with a VW Bus welded on top?  What show did you see that at?  A good 
friend of mine used to tour in her '63 Kombi and mentioned that school 
bus was quite the setup!  Funny that it pops up again....I hadn't heard 
anything about it in at least a few years!

Toodles,

Jason
