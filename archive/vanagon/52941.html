Subject: Re: re 97 EV questions

&gt;1) Does the VR6 with the (must have) automatic still feel substantialy
 &gt;stronger than the audi 5 with a 5 speed?

I own a '93 EV with weekender.

I have testdriven the '97 camper EV w/ VR6 and...

It is a little quicker, esp. considering the extra weight of that winnie
monstrosity ( no offense, I just prefer Westfalia ),  the $15,000
question is... is it that much quicker?  NO not in my opinion.

Probably the best upgrade is the reduced interior noise especially from
the engine, road noise seems the same.

The window swithces and dash controlls have been changed; I think for
the worse.

All totaled I would buy a 97 over a 95 camper if I didn't want a '93
weekender.

Elliot
