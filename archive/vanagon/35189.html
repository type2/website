Subject: &quot;Lack of&quot; compression test - 79 Bust

&lt;sigh&gt;

While searching for probable causes of my bust's lousy performance I went
out and got a compression tester and a fuel/vacuum pressure gauge.  I've
never done a compression test on this motor before so I thought it might be
a good idea.  I figured it would be ok because the bus starts great and runs
ok -- aside from the up and down idle speed.

I pulled the plugs and did a compression test, here's the results:

Cyl          Compression          Plug condition
---          -----------          --------------
 1                0 (or Oh-Oh)    Looked perfect, like the day it was born.
 2               70               Some carbon deposits, a little oily.
 3                0 (see #1)      Carbonated, oily build-up.
 4              101               Not quite a briquette's worth, but close +
some oil

Well now, this wasn't the least bit encouraging.  I repeated the test, same
results.  Then I replaced all of the plugs and fired it up.  Vroom!  When I
get it really warm, however, it starts to miss big time.  Note:  I did the
compression test on a cold engine.  I can't remember if this is a bad idea
or not.  I remember reading somewhere that you don't want to remove the
plugs when the engine is hot.  My #4 plug is starting to get that &quot;I'm
tight, I'm loose, I'm tight&quot; feeling when removing/installing.  ... I just
re-read that but I'll hold my comments, I'd hate to offend anyone with my
lame humor or get administriviated off the list again...

Anyway, am I forked or what?  I got this bus really cheap, really really
cheap, so if I had to put $500 or so into it I wouldn't be heartbroken.  Of
course, I've had it almost 1.5 years and never had it above 30mph so maybe
$600 would be ok.  But, that would buy me a bus in better shape than mine
with only one dead cylinder so I don't know.  I really want a 77-79 Westy so
maybe it's some sort of cruel blessing in disguise.

The only remotely good 'VW-related' thing I have to report is that I believe
I've found the only VW bone yard in Southern Maryland.  I snooped around a
bit and found seven splitties and two crusty, mouldy loaves.  Also about a
hundred bugs and quite a few type IIIs.  Since it was raining and I wasn't
invited, I didn't stay very long.  I did get the guy on the phone and he
seems super cool.  I think he'll be a good source of parts, when I get more
details I'll post a reply to the 'Junkyard List Response: Disappointed!!'
thread.
