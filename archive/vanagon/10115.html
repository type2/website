Subject: [f] What?
Date: Tue, 17 Jan 1995 11:32:46 -0800 (PST)

So Will Self says:
&gt; What is this [f] that people put in their subject headers?  I also see
&gt; (f).  And then is there also an {f}?  Are they different?  Are there various 
&gt; other permissible bracketings, such as ([{f}]) ?
&gt; 
&gt; Will Self
&gt; Northerly climes
&gt; 

Just ask Derek Drew.....

Somehow you missed the discussion on how Derek feels that if the discussion
strays too much from VW talk and is not really useful information, that we
should put a subscript [f]  or /f on the subject line so his script routine
can junk those files so he doesn't have to read them.  Just a courtesy I
guess.
