&gt;   Hope this is clear to you now. At the time I am writing this up my 84 vanagon
&gt;   is dripping coolant too. About nearly a quart a week...
&gt; 
                                    *************** 
&gt; 
&gt;   I think it's appropriate to pursue this with VWoA, please don't misunderstand
&gt;   me. I would expect them, however, to  try and wiggle out of it on account of
&gt;   the age of the vehicle. Although the mileage is low, they may argue that the
&gt;   odometer cable had been disconnected or some such thing. Does anyone know
&gt;   if there is a &quot;statute of limitations&quot; or something like that VW may use
&gt;   to deny secret warranty coverage in a situation like this. What made me 
&gt;   uneasy was that they wanted to take the engine apart, most likely at your
&gt;   expense, BEFORE a determination of how much financial assistance would be
&gt;   provided by VWoA. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Has anyone's experience shown that VW has engineered a solution to this 
&gt;   problem - is the engine updated during these repairs? Or does the cycle of
&gt;   corrosion and subsequent leakage repeat itself. The rebuilder in Sacramento
&gt;   showed me some failed heads and they are pretty ugly! I hadn't realized how
&gt;   deep the pitting could get before the leakage would be bad enough that the
&gt;   owner would initiate repairs. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Good luck, David
                        ATTENTION ! ATTENTION! 
  I have been following this thread for quite a while
   Since there are so many of us affected by this engineering defect
   I would suggest that we start the preparation of a Class action
   against VWoA. 
   I think its about time VWoA start taking notice and face up to
   their responsibility.
   I have been given the run around when my Vanagon had problems
   and had already spent several thousand dollars on repairs, all
   by authorized VW dealers. My 84'Vanagon has only 56k miles and many
   of the problems  that were discussed on this group is history to me.
                 Chronology of repairs from time Vanagon was purchased new
             Approximate mileage
		20k miles   First clutch went
		32K miles   Second clutch went
		40K miles   One side of cylinder head had coolant leak
                45K miles   Third clutch went. Now on fourth clutch.
                50k miles   front wheel bearings went bad
                            Both wheel sets were replaced at about
                            5000 miles apart.
                            Whole exhaust manifold system is in
                            bad shape and had to be welded in several
                            areas. Replaced the muffler
		54k miles   Water pump failed
      	        55k miles   Vanagon sat for a year in garage
                56k miles   Started to use van again Summer '94 but
                            pushrods tubes seals started to leak oil
                            after a few weeks of operation.
                            CV joints went bad and had to be replaced
                59k miles   Van still in garage waiting for new
                            exhaust system before it can hit the
                            road again.

			    Total repair parts and labor to date
                            My estimate is around $6000.00	 
                         
       I wonder anyone out there reading 
   can beat my record for frequency of repairs for the Vanagon GL 
   These are the major repairs, I have not even mention the minor
   repairs e.g airconditioner malfunction, poor quality bumpers, etc.
   
   P/s I spoke to a lawyer friend and he said he will be willing
   to prepare the class action suit for court certification for $2000.00
   I think if we can get enough people to prorate the cost we should be
   able to start this whole thing in motion.  
   All interested parties please comment.
