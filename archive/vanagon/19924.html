Subject: Bay Westy Upholstery Snaps &amp; etc.

I checked the package of the snap kit last night and it is made by COGHLAN'S
(not Coleman).  Coghlan's Snap Fastener Kit (item #8811). &quot;Everything you
need to add or replace snap fasteners. Contains: 8 sets nickle plated
screw-in stud to canvas fasteners, flaring tool, setting base&quot;  The company
is based in Canada (No address on package).  Unfortunately, I don't remember
the name of the store I bought them from.  It was something generic-sounding
like &quot;Camping Outlet&quot;.
