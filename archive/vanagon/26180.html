&gt;So!  My question is, does anyone have any good techniques for finding a 
&gt;coolant leak that so far shows itself only by the odor?  I'm finding no 
&gt;leakage anywhere.

Many shops now have the materials &amp; tools to put dyes in the vehicle's fluids
(coolant, freon, etc.).  These dyes can then be seen with a special light.  I
don't know if it's a regular &quot;black light&quot; or something more exotic.
