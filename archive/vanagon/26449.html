A good source for those pieces is the RV supply store. Cheeper and close to
what VW used.

&gt;   The faucet on my '73 Westfalia started leaking at the
&gt; base of the spout.  It has been weakened over the years
&gt; by slamming the sink cover down on it.  The spout has
&gt; recently fallen out of the pump housing.
&gt;   Does anyone have any advice on repairing/replacing this
&gt; busted faucet?
