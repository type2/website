Subject: I'm going to drip mode

OK OK.  I'm going to good newer-fashioned drip mode to satisfy my 
caffeine requirements.  Thanks for all the advice, both culinary and 
medical.  I'm never wrong so there must be a *design fault* in the 
percolater.   yeah... that's it... 

cheers,

brian.

for sale:  one hardly used Percolater.  Makes *excellent* coffee.  Or 
trade for a 12V grinder and coffee maker combo set.
