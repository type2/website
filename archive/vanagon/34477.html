&gt;Well the shop, which charges $70 per hour, has spent two hours and can only
&gt;tell me that it is not the servo and that some thing is stuck.  They say
that
&gt;they will have to tear open the transmission and have no idea what they will
&gt;find.  They recommend that I drive without fixing.  That I will only need it
&gt;if I get stuck and that the 4-WD works great.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody out there ever use there rear differential lock?  How much would it
&gt;cost to replace the whole tranny?
&gt;
&gt;Frustrated and owned a VW less than a week,

Servo getting stuck happens when people don't take care to ensure all seals
are in place.  I t may be possible to repair with trans in van if mechanic
really knows what he/she is doing.  Normal fix is to remove trans, all work
can then be done with only removing bell housing.  Might as well relace
clutch parts while ther.  Also consider starter if high mileage.  Although
posible, very very very difficult with trans in van.  Labor should be about
10 hours or so for whole job.
