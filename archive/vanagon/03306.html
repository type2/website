&gt; BTW, on my long long summer trip I waved at everybody in VW vans.  Any body see
&gt; me?  I'm in a guacemole green 76 with a big black storage box bolted to the top
&gt; rack - in front of the pop top.  I have Indiana plates.

I remember seeing two guacamole buses on my summer trip this year (not
that i saw only two... but i disctinctly remember two..)

one was at mt. rushmore parking lot as I was doing a valve adjustment,
the other was when I was broke down in a parking lot along highway 101
down by the beach just south of crescent city (way northern 
california).  I have an orange '73 poptop with nebraska plates..
