Subject: Rear Speakers

OK, so I have decided to look into installing decent speakers
into my new '87 Westy.  Question : How do you get to the rear 
speakers?  The AC appears to be in the way and I can't seem to 
find an easy way around it.  Any suggestions?  Also, any 
recommendations for _good_ speakers that will fit into the
original speaker holes?

Also, I have a loose on/off switch on the panel that shows water /
battery level, so it cuts on and off.  Is that worth attempting to 
fix, should I browse junkyards or attempt to find a new one?

Thanks
Stephen Jones
