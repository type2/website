&gt; I recently purchased an '81 Westy.  The pop top's surface has small cracks

&gt; to clean the top to get it back to its original white?   Also what can I put 
&gt; on the fiberglass top to keep it from getting dirty again soon?
&gt; 

There was a series of articles some time ago in Hot VW on Westfalia
restoration.  They recommended a bathroom mildew remover (like X-14,
I think it's called) to clean up the top.  They claimed very good
results.
