Subject: RE: live chat night


&gt;   I've mentioned recently about having a live chat night on an Irc system.
&gt;Well, I was told about channel VW on 'The Efnet'.  Well I've stopped by a
&gt;few times and that there was no one there to chat with. Sure there was a
&gt;couple of people on the channel, but they were not talking.


I've just recently become acquainted with IRC (Internet Relay Chat,
I believe). Been using the server irc.portal_dot_com and have dropped in
on the #VW channel a few times. Sometimes it's quite lively, sometimes
not. A few people stay logged on 24 hrs/ 7 days, but don't always talk,
obviously.

In order not to wind up like Macs and PCs, separate in a common world,
why don't we all stick with this channel, until we get a good reason
to leave? Then we'll all know where to find each other-- those of us
crazy enough to try this instead of having a real life, that is.  :^)
