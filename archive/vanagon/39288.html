Subject: Sad Splits (hybrid grafts)

We have a couple of infamous beasties here too..a coach (like US school bus)
has a Deluxe top half welded on top and is always to be seen at the
Glastonbury Festival...then there is the Kombi with a beetle top half grafted
onto its roof (boy is that ugly) ...when we publish photos of these things it
goes in a section I call Sad Splits (which my children now tell me has another
modern slang meaning as well as just mourning the passing of another Split).
