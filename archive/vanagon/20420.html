Subject: '57 Pickup Restroation

I need parts to complete a restoration to as close to orginal as I can.  I
need side and rear gates in excelent condition.  Also looking for engine
compartment  and side compartment doors.  Need parts for the fresh air duct.
 If you have anything you think I might need that you have tell all.

This is a great list.  Like hearing all your stories and adventures.  Someday
I'll compose some good ones about my pickup and me.

John
