Umm, if you just want to see what you're doing at various speeds, you 
can use a tune-up meter.  My tach was given to me by a friend.  I have 
no idea where he got it from.  But it was free.  I didn't want to make 
any big holes in my dash, so I have it duct taped on.  :)  It's been 
that way for 2-3 years now.
