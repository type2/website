Subject: Fwd: [FS] 1982 Diesel Westy

I have the name and number of a woman who is selling her Westy.

I have entertained the thought of buying it myself, but due to
the financial catastrophe which is Graduate School (which is 
forcing me to sell my `88, dammit!) I've changed my mind.

If you are interested or know anyone who is, let me know.

She lives in Wilmington, NC and is a little flighty, thus,
I'm reluctant to post her number across such an unstable
medium =)

If you call soon, you might be able to get it before the 
hurricane hits her house.
