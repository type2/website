Subject: Vallejo Car Show!!

Listees,

  Just a note to let the people that plan to attend the VW show on Sunday, That 
Volks-Motorsports, and the Volks Cafe are one of the contributing sponsers to the 
show.

  We will have a booth, Mostly High Performance Water-Cooled car Garb, But I managed 
to squeeze a small amount of space to display some product and meet people.  If you're 
going to be at the show, stop by the booth.  I'd like to put some faces to all the 
different names I know and have helped in the last year.

  If anyone wants something speacial brought up to them, let me know before noon 
Saturday.  I'll be heading up in the afternoon on Saturday.

  Hope to see lots of people there and make new friends.

  Kyle
