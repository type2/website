Subject: TriStar Syncro article

A guy at work came running up to the '68 crew cab last week with lots of
questions.  He wants a bug like he used to have and we've talked a lot
lately.  Anyway, this morning he brought me a copy of an article out of the
April 1990 Car and Driver magazine on a supposedly one-off TriStar Syncro.
Somehow, I thought there was more one, but obviously not many.  There's a
quote from a VWOA person (&quot;Volkswagen U.S.'s Vanagon chief) - &quot;We don't see
a market for the Tri Star at the price we'd have to charge for it.&quot;
Supposedly that price would have been $35,000-$40,000.  But this is a loaded
vehicle - a concept car type.

Several interesting figures in the article: &quot;Of the roughly 130,000 Type II
(Vanagon) vehicles Volkswagen builds each year, about half feature the Tri
Star's &quot;double-cab&quot; pickup body style.&quot;  HALF?  Where are they all?

Also, &quot;Currently, about 80 percent of the Type IIs VW builds are bought for
commercial use only.&quot;  I guess that's believable, at least in Europe.

BTW - the special items in this package are - Syncro crew cab pickup,
&quot;first-class&quot; stereo system (?), sunroof, BBS wheels, a &quot;Porsche-grade&quot;
paint job, cloth interior, electric mirrors and windows.

Interesting article.  They shoulda made more of them........

FWIW, 
Dean
