&gt;Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt;doors are for?  Should they be slid to the front or back to keep the air
&gt;flowing or warm the bus up?

they are part of the Fresh-Aire Ventilation System. :)  on the front edge
of the front door is a big rubber gasket that surrounds a big vent hole.
the air comes from the middle of the dash, out through a big tube, into the
door via that vent hole, then out the back of the door and into the B-pillar
and up into the roof vents.

the sliding gizmos on the bottom edge of the rear of the door are to let
fresh air get sucked into the door? or blown out of the door? never did
figure out which. but by adjusting those sliders, you can affect the flow
of fresh air and heat inside the bus. not much, but it does make an effect.

on the 88 and later buses, these sliders are still there, but the hole in
the door behind them is taped over ... vw moved this function to those funny
black foam thingies in the rear edge of the rear side windows. at least,
that's what they tell me.
