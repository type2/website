Subject:      4X4 Eurovan??

Hello:

I am long-time vw owner.  Approx 12 VW's.  Most recent were a '87 Vanagon
Synchro GL, and then a '91 Vanagon Synchro.

I recently traded the '91 on Suzuki Sidekick and am without a VW for the
first time since about 1971!  Feels a bit odd really.

The '97 had about 90,000 miles on it when I traded it in.
The '91 had about 211,000 miles on it.

I noticed in your &quot;syncros&quot; page that the text reads &quot;Vanagon's and
Eurovan's with full time four wheel drive.&quot;

I have been watching for the 4X4 Eurovan to show up.  I have asked about
it
at the Chicago Auto show a few times but they always say 'never'.....

I did see an ad for Steyer-Puch in one of the automotive trade mags about
8
years ago.  It was an ad touting Steyer-Puch's 4X4 development projects
over the years.  There were pictures of a number of 4X4 projects that they
had had a hand in including a few Mercedes, some military stuff AND one
photo of the Eurovan Syncro.

It is the only press coverage of a Eurovan Syncro I have ever seen.

Were there any?  Are there any?  Is it possible to get one in the USA?

Also, what is the history of the Tri-Star Crew-Cab pickups?  Are they
available in the USA?  Canada?  What are they worth lately?  Is Tri-Star
just a model name? or a converter like Westfalia?  Or a coachbuilder like
Karmann?
