Subject:      Re: low oil warning light/buzzer

Listees, There was a reply from Bill that 30wt was not a reccommended oil for
vanagons, he was replying to  previous question. We have never reccommended
  10-40 wt oil  in late model vehicles. We have heard of the oil lite and
buzzing symptoms from lots of people who have used this wt. We have been here
15 yrs and always used 20-50 Castrol . We have had good luck with this wt in
CA. climate,with the use of 10-40, we found oil consumption and the buzzer
coming on.Some shops in the Ca. area do use 30wt, but in alot of extreme
climate states they would not.Thanks AVP
