About thom starter problem

I would take the starter off and take it to a good auto electrical shop
and have them bench test it (ie check the current being pulled under load)

You can do this yourself with a sufficiently high range ammeter
(inductive type with no wires to connect is most convenient)

I have bought a couple of 'new' starters over the years that didnt work
correctlyso dont rule this out.

Also check your battery cables, given this problem i would replace them
if they are over 5 years old.

The current test will tell the tale here.  Remember this is a system that
needs every thing working in good order to get the 100s of amps to the
starter to turn the car - sometimes one lousy little part can take the 
whole works down.

Oh yeah - check your battery with a hygrometer and make sure all the
cells are charging evenly - if one is bad (partic. with 6 volts) it can
pass enough current for bright lights (10 amps) but not enough to
turn starter - arent electrical problems fun ???


Wait a minute - you're a sysop - you can do anything !!!!
