Howdy,

	I just got _the_ definitive answer on the split-case/tunnel-case 
conversion issue.  I called bus-boys and asked.  They make an adapter
that goes from the nosecode of the new tranny to the old body.  Its $30.
It seems, from asking around here, that they are the only ones that make
this piece.
