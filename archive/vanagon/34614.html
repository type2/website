So Joseph F. Fournier II says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'll assume that Arkansawers don't have to follow the rules since meeting 
&gt; other list members on accident is about as likely as a good surf day.

&gt; Otherwise, I'll have to get out the slide rule and figure our where top 
&gt; middle/whatever is. ;) Joe
