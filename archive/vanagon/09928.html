Subject: Help getting on the list


Hi All,
Sorry to waste the bandwidth, but I've lost my original access and have
been ignored by the list server twice when I tried to re-acquire the list.
I've also lost Gary's address.  If someone could send it to me or, Gary,
if you see this please contact me.
Thanks,
Jack
