&gt;&gt;Randy,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I would just be careful about running the compressor(accidentally) without it
&gt;&gt;being charged.  Most rely on the refrigerant for lubrication.  I learned this
&gt;&gt;the hard way on my scirroco.  Some cars run the compressor when the defroster
&gt;&gt;is switched on but I don't think the vanagons do.

Disconnect the wires form the compressor, and the clutch won't engage.

Actually, it shouldn't engage under low pressure, due to the low pressure
cut off switch, but I wouldn't bet money on it in a pinch.  DIsconnected
wires have a tendency to block current flow, though.
