Subject: Re:  72 Bus steering question

WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!!

How loose is your steering exactly ????

If you can turn the wheel more than a 1/2&quot; or so without feeling resistance
PARK IT until you can get this put right !!!

Buddy of mine had a 72 he had just bought, rolling down the Kensington 
Expwy in Buffalo at 65, he says to - &quot;Lookee here - steering git 'kinda' loose

proceeds to turn steering wheel an ENTIRE REVOLUTION while said bus
proceeds straight as an arrow down the highway

I empty my drawers, and tell him to GENTLY pull over.

Upshot: The swing arm housing (frontmost thing on the lower axle tube
had snapped off, so there was no fulcrum for the steering linkage -
essentially no steering......


still get chills thinking about this 10 years later ...
