&gt;
&gt;I'm heading out west next fall and will be working in the Rockies over 
&gt;the winter, probably at a ski resort.  Any suggestions on winter 
&gt;driving?  eg. should I invest in chains? if so...any good suggestions?

Back in Germany, I saw those really neat gizmos, that seem to be far
better than chains. They call them Spiders (I think) and their advantage
is that they are extremely easy to install, don't rust (cause made of
plastic), and are not as &quot;clunky.&quot; Also saw them in use in Switzerland: a
majority of cars had them.

Basically, in the late Fall, when people put on their Matsch + Schnee
tires, they add a disc shaped, plastic thingy (about 6&quot; diameter) to each
wheel, in place of the hubcaps. When roads are snowy enough, those discs
serve as receptacles and each securely holds a spider-shaped contraption.
This contraption consists of the 8 plastic legs or arms that reach around
the tire.

Unfortunately, they are outrageously expensive. I think I saw a pair for
about 500,- DM, about $300+, I believe. If anyone has seen them anywhere
on the North-American continent, please let me know. They make a great
X-mas gift!
