With all of new new emission laws under the Federal Clean Air Act, one

&gt; Thanks to all for your advice on FI computers for my '77 Westy.  My local

&gt; Regarding the suggestion to switch to carberation, I don't recommend it; 
&gt; ordinarily my FI has been virtually trouble free, and the van always

&gt; understanding of the FI system.  It's really not all that complicated.
