Subject: Re: '70 Bus - Is this a good deal???


&gt; Personal opinion: If it REALLY has no rust and is straight 
and runs well, 
&gt; it's worth $2000 easy. You can buy one with problems for 
$700 and put 
&gt; $1300 into or.... 8) Joe


sounds like it is a good deal assuming the &quot;no rust&quot; part is 
true, you might bear in mind that this is the last year for 
drum brakes and 71 was the first yesr for those lovely disc 
brakes...
