Subject: Re: Mineral to Synthetic?

Stick with conventional/mineral oil.  all that synthetic is is expensive.
and if you have even say a minor leak well its $4 a quart.   I have owned
vehicles before (VW and other) that have never had anything but regular old
motor oil in them.  and some of these vehicles have gone over 200,000 miles.
I also used to work in auto parts biz and most eveerybody that bought
synthetic oil had this misconception that they could go longer between oil
changes, like 3,000, 5,000 and some even said 10,000 miles.  i'm glad I'll
never be buying one of these peoples cars, but then again how would I know?
Change oil and filter every 2,000 miles and use regular old oil.  thats all
I have to say.

&gt;With all this talk about synthetics, is there a suggested converion for the

&gt; What weight would I use if I were to switch to synthetic?  I have an 85
&gt;Vanagon GL Westy with a 1.9l waterboxer.  Only 700 miles on the rebuild
&gt;engine, so I couldn't switch for a while.
