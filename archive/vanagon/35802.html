Subject:  '82 Westy diesel at home-update

Well, I decided to purchase a new oil cooler for my Westy. I thought about 
running around without one for a while, but I'm sure those VW engineers had a 
good reason to add that cooler!

As you may remember, the local dealer wanted $205 for a new cooler and seal. 
Last night, I called Bob Hoy's auto parts. I have used them in the past, and 
always been happy with their service. They want $147 for the same cooler and 
seal, plus about $10 shipping. Gave them a credit card number, and it will be 
here next week, providing the UPS gods smile upon me.

I would really rather install a better cooling system as Dennis H. suggested to 
me, but I just don't have the time to invest in it now. I would run without the 
cooler, but I have no oil temp guage, and once again, not the time to install 
one. And I don't have the time to search through junkyards for a possibly good 
one. Seems like the factory part is the way to go for now.

That's all for now!
