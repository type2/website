Stephen (and everyone else)

I went and checked out the air-cooled Vanagon Westy today.  The guy had an
info sheet in the window, so I was able to get some good information on it:

It is a 1980 model
It has a 10' x 10' side tent
It is a California model (electronic ignition, oxygen sensor, and really
really weird exhaust)
It has 79,500 miles with 3500 miles on a recently rebuilt engine
It has dual batteries
It has A/C
It has a new exhaust, new battery, new ECU, and new differential/rear end
The interior looks very clean and nice.  Rear seat/bed still has funky
original upholstery, front seats have been redone or have been replaced
with one from a later model, I can't tell.  The speedometer looks like it
is from a later model Vanagon too
It has tinted windows.
There is some very minor surface rust mainly under the rear window seals. 
I don't know how bad the rust is under the seal though.
There are the standard minor dents and dings.
The grille has a chunk missing out of it.
I did not notice any lower body rust or seam rust
The engine seal is missing.  IDIOT owner apparently spends mucho money
rebuilding the engine and then leaves out the damn seal.  I'm not too
impressed with him on that point and it makes me wonder.


I did not speak to the owner.  All the above information was gained from
observation and reading the owner-prepared info sheet.

He is asking $6500, which is way too high for this van.  This is not a
$6500 van.  My van is in better shape and only cost $3500.

The phone number is (423) 283-7148.  

I did not drive the van so I can't comment there.  If someone far away is
interested, call the owner and then we can arrange a meeting where I can go
drive it and talk to the owner, etc.  

Again, this van is in Johnson City, TN.

probably go
&gt; &gt; check this one out more thoroughly after work tomorrow.
&gt; hello there,
&gt; 
&gt; I could be interested in this one, let me know what the scoop is.
&gt; 
&gt; thank you very much,
