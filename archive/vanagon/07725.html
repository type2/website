&gt; This is my first post, Yay!, and I just have a couple of quick questions.
&gt; I have a '59 Kombi and it's my first bus. So far I've only seen        
&gt; references to Bentley manuals for '63 to '67. I've got the idiot book
&gt; already (I use it a LOT too :-) but I like the bentley manuals for
&gt; some of the specific stuff. Is this manual valid for my model, except
&gt; for maybe the bullet turn signals? 

Well, they just started reprinting the manual for the late split window 
busses.  So I doubt that you'd find one for yours.  There are a few 
differences, like you probably have a reserve gas switch, not a gas 
gauge.  I'm sure there are also other differences, but I don't know 
them.  

&gt; Also, I am replacing the engine in the bus. It had a '57 1200 sitting
&gt; in the back seat when I got it(and it still turns even) but I decided I
&gt; might want to get on a highway someday so anyway, what's the story on
&gt; the flywheels, I seem to remember this coming up before, but I may have
&gt; missed a crucial part, Are the 12 and 6 volt flywheels the same size? I
&gt; know that the teeth are different, ergo if you have a 12 volt flywheel,
&gt; you have a 12 volt starter to fit it, but are the diameters the same, or
&gt; will a 12 volt flywheel machine my transmission for me?

The teeth are different, and so is the size.  You need to make room in 
the bell of the tranny for the 12V flywheel.  I would suggest machining 
it out yourself, and not relying on the flywheel to do it. :)
