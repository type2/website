Subject: Re: Golf Syncro ? ? ?



Golf were produced in two syncro models that I am aware of. One was the Golf 
Syncro Country which was probably what you saw....a turquois blue metallic 
color with the spare tire on a rack on the back, a brush bar on the front, 
and raised about 8&quot; from stock. I saw one in Grenoble, France this January 
and drove the owner crazy as we chased it around town for about 20 minutes 
photographing it from every angle.

The second version was the Golf Syncro Rallye. The Rallye version was 
assembled in VW's plant in Brussells. It was, as the name implied a &quot;rallye&quot; 
version, or actually VW had toproduce enough of them to be qualified under 
FIA rules to be a production car. The Rallye had a supercharged 2.0 litre 
motor, adjustable suspension...lots of goodies. Back in 1989 or 90 there was 
a Golf Synchro Rallye in the US used by a fellow from Vermont (forgot his 
name) who was competing in the SCCA pro-rallye series at the time. I got to 
drive it for 10 minutes...lots of fun. HOwever, he wasn't very successful 
with it...it kept breaking down under the stress, and lack of VW parts for 
it on this side of the Atlantic.
