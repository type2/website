Subject: 79 FI oil leaks

Please Help!
I just cleaned the underside of the engine to see where oil is
coming from.  It is coming down the front side of the oil filter.
A while back when I changed oil, I used a rabbit oil filter because it
is longer, but began seeing oil leaks from it.  About a month ago 
I changed back to the bus oil filter, but the thing is still 
leaking.  Is it the filter, or something from above?  I position myself right under the filter and it comes down it towards the front of the van.
Do I need a new filter, or is it something worse?
