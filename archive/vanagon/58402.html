Subject: Vanagon Head Leak

The rear nut holding the &quot;Intake air distributor&quot; to the crankcase is
doing its best to remain firmly attached to it bolt.  As many of you
must know, the TDC sensor is in the way and subject to damage, when
trying to loosen this nut.  The sockets I have are all too deep to pass
the TDC sensor and seat firmly on the nut.

Removing the TDC sensor not on my list of 100 fun things to do on a
Saturday.  Has anybody removed this nut successfully and if so, what
secret tool did you find in the Black Forest to do it with?
