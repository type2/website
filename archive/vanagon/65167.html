  A                    RE&gt;&gt;re- Oxygen Sensor Reset
Why was this so hard.  Surely someone out there must have had similar
experiences, I suppose it is cause if you don't have an Ox reset problem, you
don't think about it.

Here is what I've found:

o It sounds like Canadian vehicles don't have an Ox Sensor light.  I believe
Bently mentions something about &quot;US&quot; only, or maybe the '89 owners manual, I'm
not sure which, it was a looong weekend.

o My '89 SyncroBeast has the Ox light, but doesn't have the reset.  (No wires
past the fuse block, connector C, pins 2 and 11)  Stickers on the door jam
lead me to believe that mine is NOT Canadian, but US.

o My '90 Vanagon Carat did not have.  Not even mentioned in the owners manual.
 Same situation as SyncroBeast, but w/o light in dash.  Wire from dash to
connector block B on fuse block, nothing else.

o Bently shows you where it is if you have a reset box for the Ox sensor
light.  It's on the left side (Drivers side) frame rail, inside, just above
the spare tire.

o Be aware, not all vehicles have the Ox light reset.  If you have it, it's in
the stock location Bently shows, if it's not there, then you shouldn't have a
reset problem.

 ?? start at the left front wheel, and follow the speedo cable upwards
 toward the dash pod ... the little box has got to be in there somewhere!!
 on my non-syncro, the box is about the size of a large pack of
 cigarettes. it has the two speedo cables screwed into it, and a
three-wiremulti-plug gizmo with a rubber boot over it.
