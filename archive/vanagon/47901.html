Subject:  supervan tires in winter?

i have fairly new yokohama supervan (y356) tires (185r14, i think came
stock on vanagons around 87 maybe?), and am wondering what the
performance on snow would be like.  i'm thinking of extending the
camping season this year (got chafed out of most of the summer so far
due to rebuild problems) and spending most of november in colorado,
utah, california, arizona, and new mexico.  are these tires going to be
enough for the snowy passes, or am i going to need more serious
rubber?  any experiences with these?

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
