Subject: [f] Message for Martha

        Dear Martha:
        
        Sorry to use the bandwidth this way but I do not have or cannot 
        find your address.  As I checked my messages (all 390 plus of 
        them) after being out of town, I noticed your inquiry about 
        information on the Thing or Type 181.  If you are still 
        interested in information about these money pits, I can share 
        what I know.  There is a Thing list but it is either comatose or 
        expired as I rarely get mail from it.
