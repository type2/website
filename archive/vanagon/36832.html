Our friend pulled out his torch and started heating the tube, and we 
pulled the pedal up and down.

Wow- am i also poisoned, or a step ahead of your state guru..........  I love
my propane torch,  and use it regulary to unstick rusted things........the
other week i did the exact same thing - the stuck clutch pedal on a 64 21
window,  today i was taking off a very rusted on muffler- i didnt want to
snap the studs in the heads.    For taking apart bumpers it is crucial- as
snapping off 13mm bolts in the overriders tubes is a real pain.  i like to
heat it till it glows, and then shock it by dumping cold water on it.       a
useful tool
