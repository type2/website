Subject: re Poptop Canvas

&gt;
&gt;Can anyone recommend a treatment for the canvas so I can keep the top
&gt;popped in the rain?
&gt;
&gt;Thanx!

Care and Maintenance
The canvas has been treated to repel water, resist mildew, and minimize
shrinkage.
1. Vacuum or hose down occasionally, brushing lightly with a cloth or soft
brush. Wash only with clear water. Detergents or solvents may remove the
waterproofing. Dry before folding.
2. Canvas should be stored only when dry and clean.
3. When closing pop top, make sure that the canvas is folded in neatly and
is not pinched or in contact with any sharp object. (Duh!)
4. Air out canvas top frequently

Warning:
The use of insect and other aerosol sprays near canvas may impair the water
repellency of the fabric and cause leakage.

***

So there you have it. I've had mine out down on the Oregon coast in some
pretty severe weather in January and I didn't have any problems with
leakage.

Also another note on the next page:

The pop top is made of Luran (r) from BASF. It should be washed with a
gentle detergent and periodically polished with a quality automotive wax.
