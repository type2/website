Subject: Convincing my wife...


How do you guys/gals do it?  A friend of mine really wants to sell me 
a '73 beetle,  it runs,  no rust,  a real beauty....plus two of its 
organ donors which can be left in the field where they currently reside.
The price?  $750.00 for all three...my wife is quite sceptical.  Is ity
jealously?  Could be the staggering price tag....Should I be sneaky?
I tried the Xmas thing already....I would love some input...
