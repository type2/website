Subject: RE: cooler Thermostat

Hello group: my $.02 worth....only differance between the two thermostats 
is that one will opens at 80C and the other at 87C.. Once they open they 
have nothing to do with how hot your motor runs......Only time there 
would be any diff is in the winter and one would keep your engine warmer 
than the other.......
Peace, Doc
