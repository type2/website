Subject: Re: Westies w/ ATs

&gt;     Should I avoid the AT version of the VW bus/vanagon?  or are they an 
&gt;     acceptable alternative to the 4sp?  

I have a '77 westy with an at with 100,321 miles on it, it runs strong. My
good friend and list member has a '71 4spd which I have driven several
times, it definately has an edge on acceleration that a stick alllows, but
this may also be due in part to the bug engine in it. The drawback to the at
is if something goes wrong the parts seem to be more expensive. From my
experience in looking for a bus the at seems to be far less common than the
4spd. I do like the at, especially in the morning on the way to work when I
am trying to eat, drink, smoke, and choose tapes to listen to while driving
in stop and go traffic on the freeway.
