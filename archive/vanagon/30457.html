So Brad Snyder says:
&gt; the fast idle has not reappeared after several weeks!!
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen it mentioned that there may be some bad connections in 
&gt; the main FI computer box, but I haven't seen it mentioned for the 
&gt; idle control box, so I thought that maybe this would help someone.
&gt; 

Nice work Brad.  I'm more and more convinced that the black box cold solder
joints are probably more to blame than the &quot;harness&quot; fix that VW claims as
the fix.  I think that if anyone has the hesitation problem or any intermittent
problem with the Vanagon, I'd strongly suggest that they do what Brad did
and make sure that any suspect soldering is fixed.  Make sure that precautio-
nary measures are taken e.g. remove the battery cable before operating on
the electrical system.
