There is a thermo-switch on the back fins of the reefer, connected to
a little fan.  When the fins get too hot, the fan goes on to cool them
off.  The reefer works by heating up the chamber and a siphon-heat-pump
is set up.  Both the 12v and 120v lines run electric resistance heaters,
and of course the propane burns, creating heat.  Both this heat *and*
the heat removed from inside the reefer must be born away by the air
flowing over these vents.  This hot air rises out of the grille at the
back of the reefer unit on top.

If this thing overheats (like your interior is too hot) then the fan
is there to assist.  Interestingly, while this is shown in the VW
manual, the Dometic manual does not show this on their picture of the
182 reefer.

The thermo-switch is normally-open.  I don't know the temperature it
closes at.  I test mine by holding a match near...
