Obsolete, capitalized, hyphenated, and foreign words are all
permissible, but only count 1 point, regardless of length.
All decisions are made by Joel and are final.

Winner gets a big hug from Martha, to be delivered during the Bricks
Across America tour.  (Completely Platonic, of course.)  (If Martha wins
she gets to hug everybody, even including old farts like me and Joel.)
