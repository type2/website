&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;   I saw a post about how to know if the fridge is working if the

&gt;next to the controls,  it looks like a battery check gauge.  When its lite
&gt;it should be completely in the green.  Later model had a nice red or green
&gt;LED on on the outside near the water level lights. Light on, its working.
&gt;Hope this helps.

&gt;( Shameless ad here)   LiMBO has aquired a complete 'Dometic Vanagon Camper
&gt;Refrigerator' manual.  Has care and feeding instructions, parts list and
&gt;illustrations.  Nicely bound photo copies are available for $7.00.

Jim,

Do you know if anyone makes a better 'drop-in' replacement for the Dometic
fridge?  I got spoiled by the Winnie Eurovan fridge on my trip to Invuik.
