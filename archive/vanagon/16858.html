Subject: Re: Piston Pin

St. Muir suggests heating the piston with rags soaked with boiling water, 
but I think that may have been for getting the pin IN.  If it's a ridge
problem, heat won't help much.  If it's a fit problem, Muir's idea may
work and isn't hard to try (esp. with engine out.)
Good luck.
B.
