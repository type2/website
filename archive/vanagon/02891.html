&gt; Joel! (and all yer cousins) - 
&gt;
&gt; Be very careful!  Non-forking family trees can be the sign of
&gt; something much more serious, namely, redneckitis.  Telltale
&gt; warning signs include:

I got a few more:

You made it good by moving into a double-wide.
You cut the grass and find a car in the yard.
Your boat costs more than your house and truck.

No, I am not a redneck.   I just play one. ;)
