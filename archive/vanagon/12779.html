&gt;Looking for the rear seat that converts to a bed to fit a '82 Vanagon.

for Buz (and others) ... you might also want to check out any vanagons from
1985-1991 that have the Weekender package. that's a full-width rear seat that
folds down into a queen-size bed. perhaps not as comfortable as the camper
seat/bed, but it should fit ok. only problem might be the big anchor bolts
in the sides (85 and later should already have these ... maybe 80-84 as well?)
