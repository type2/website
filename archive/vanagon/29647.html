 Brian,

 On my '74, I've found that the effectivness of the emergency brake is
 influenced a good deal by whether the rear brakes are adjusted properly.
 When the rear shoes have just been adjusted, the e brake will be tight
 after five or six &quot;clicks&quot; As the shoes wear, the number of e-brake
 clicks increases quickly. I use the e-brake travel as an indication
 of when to crawl under and adjust the rear drums.


 Dave
