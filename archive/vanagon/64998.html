&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; Check the filling cap on your main coolant tank. The valve inside may be
&gt; clogged or broken. It's supposed to open when pressure goes high, but mine
&gt; has been stuck open and caused overflow overflow. Perhaps the best i s to
&gt; buy a new cap, but I rinsed mine out with the hose for the shower connected
&gt; to the spout on the cap. A lot of black gunk came out, and the valve
&gt; started working again. You can test the valve by trying to blow and suck
&gt; through the spout, blowing should produce a nice farting sound, and sucking
&gt; should be impossible. If you're not a trumpeter or something :-)

You are right on buddy!  Thanks!  Air flows both ways, only slight
restriction.  Now to get another one.

Minor rant follows:
I live in a BIG city- Ft. Worth, TX, which is part of the HUGE metroplex
Dallas-FW. But local VW dealer never has parts, has to send for them in
Dallas.  This time he informs me that the Metroplex now has no parts
depot at all, the parts now have to come from Florida!

Major rant follows:
My boiling over problem started with mechanic leaned it out and advanced
timing to 12 degrees to pass inspection.  So I asked him about it.
&quot;Don't look at me! I put the mixture back to where it was after it
passed!&quot;  Why? &quot;Thot you liked it that way.&quot;  YOu mean I'm going to have
to lean it out again next year? &quot;Yup&quot;   ????
Here I am, in a major urban area, AND NOT ONE DECENT MECHANIC!  HELP!
