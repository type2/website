Subject: 91 Vanagon Auto Trans Repair Part 2

The used transmission arrived UPS on Wednesday. I pulled the pan and it looks nice and clean.

The old transmission had lots of debris in the pan and I took a sample to the dealer with me 
when I went to pick up the rest of the parts.

The parts man identified the remains as the one way clutch assembly and said it probably fed 
through some high priced pieces on its way to the oil pan. He wants me to stop by with it and do 
an autopsy with him on it at his house (he's a Vanagon nut).

Item Description				VW Part Number	Unit Price
Pinion Oil Seal(2)			089 409 529B	 $8.34
Pinion Cover Plate O-ring		010 409 259A	 $4.14
Shifter Cable Boot			251 723 580		$18.36
Accelerator Cable Boot			211 713 269B	 $4.68

Following the good advise of some listmembers, I went to get the torque convertor checked out 
and ended up getting it rebuilt. I dropped it off Friday at lunch and 3 hours and $88.00 later, 
I had a rebuilt torque convertor. Evidently it showed no signs of wear but had a large amount of 
crud inside it.

Saturday was spent reassembling the transmission to the differential, working on the 75, now my 
daily ride and family matters.

Today, I degreased the front of the motor, installed the new cable boots, and new rear seal.

Unfortunately, it started raining at 11am and didn't stop until just before dark so the trans is 
in the garage on the jack ready to go.

I do have one problem that I really don't understand. In the BENTLEY on page 37.5 it shows 
distance &quot;a&quot; being 3/8&quot; between the face of the bellhousing and the tip of the torque convertor. 
Mine measures 1/8&quot;. I have removed the turbine and oil pump shafts from the differential and 
measured the distance with the torque convertor installed only on the support shaft and still 
measure only 1/8&quot;. With the torque convertor on this way the distance from the starter ring gear 
and the starter mounting boss in the bellhousing is 1/8&quot;. In other words if I could move the 
torque convertor in 1/4&quot; more the starter ring gear would hit the bellhousing.

This problem slowed me up considerably today and is the biggest reason that the transmission is 
not in the van.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
