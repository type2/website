Subject: Re: exhaust brackets from the past

- put in synthetic -- Wow does it shift nice!
&gt;Anyway, after changing the fluid, I put gasket compound on all the
&gt;

Inquiring minds want to know..... what kind of synthetic, please?


&gt;My guess on all of this is that the braces, having broken, caused all of 
&gt;the exhaust pieces to sag and bend, so things weren't to factory spec.  
&gt;The problem is that now I have no braces on this thing and I don't know 
&gt;what I should do. 

Fix'um fast, the sustained vibration of a long trip just gets them to frag 
even faster. Any chance a local muffler shop could weld on some new bits, as 
the alignment is not critical? I've got the same prob in an '87, the only 
strut has broken, and I'd like to fix it soon. Those sagging rusty pipes are 
ready to crack through any convenient rust pit that is now being loaded in 
new and mysterious ways. tim s.
