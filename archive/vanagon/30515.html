Subject: Carb vs. FI in Vanagon?


&gt; I have two '81
&gt;Vanagon Westphalia's one with fuel inj. the other with a carb.


I am very curious about this. Did the carburetted Vanagon come that way
from the factory? I thought all Vanagons (all post-'75 busses, in fact)
had fuel injection. Can anybody straighten me out?
