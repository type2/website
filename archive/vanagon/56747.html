Subject: Wednesday Night Seattle

The Cascade Kombi chapter of NEATO meets the 1st Wednesday of the month,
 6:30 PM at the Northgate Station Roundtable Pizza, 9895 1st Ave NE, Seattle.

 The March '97 meeting will feature a trip report from Jeff Slater, who
recently returned from Wolfsburg, Germany.  His report of an audience with a
Concept One car will make for a lively interlude.

 While the emphasis is on VW buses of all vintages, all VWs and their owners
are
 welcome, regardless of their age or condition.  For Information, call Luke at
(206)
 783-1779 or pmail at 74301.2203_at_compuserve_dot_com.  The Cascade Kombis have
 been meeting at this site for nearly 10 years - the crowd and attitude are
strictly
 casual.  See you there.
