Subject: Re: best spotlight for Vanagons

Let me make one warning point here. I used to be a pizza delivery boy 
while in school. I bought one of those plug in spotlights. They are very 
easy to forget to turn off and lay face down on the seat. You can't see 
the light while laying face down on the seat. I've burned up two front 
seats in the process of learning this. You come out and look at your 
vehicle and all the windows appear to be white. You get knocked down by 
the smoke when opening the door. The front seats never caught fire, but 
they smouldered all night even after being hosed out by the fire 
department. Lots of nasty smells coming from the inside of the car. It's 
tough to explain why the pizza smells so funny. I told them it was our 
new BBQ pizza. They bought it, even tipped me :-)
