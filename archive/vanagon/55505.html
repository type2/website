Subject: Re: VW Alloy Wheels


In order to upgrade to the factory alloy wheels you will need longer lug
bolts up front and longer lug studs with different lug nuts in the rear.
Unless you have syncro which uses studs/nuts all around.  The alloy wheel
also needs tapered lug bolts and nuts, not rounded.  I'm not sure that
this is absolutly necessary but that's what I've been told.  The lug bolts
off of Saab 9000's work fine, the lug bolts from the Audi 5000 have a
rounded head.  The only place I have found longer studs that will fir the
vanagon besides the VW dealer is BBS.  I don't have that part number.
	Replacing the rear studs is another bother.  It seems that your
choices are to have someone remove your hub and press out/in you
replacement studs, or you can do it yourself.  Tim Smith suggested that it
is possible to carefully tap the old studs out of the hub while the hub is
still attached to the axle.  To install the new studs he suggested placing
several greased washers onto the stud and then tightening th lug not down
until the stud is seated.  This would be a lot of fun!  I have more time
and energy than money though.  Hope this helps

&gt; With all this talk about Alloy wheels, I would like to ask one question -
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any problem with or adjustment needed when putting standard VW
&gt; Westfalia Alloy wheels on a VW that came with steel wheels? 
&gt; 
&gt; I am purchasing a '91 Westfalia with standard steel wheels and am planning to
&gt; upgrade to VW Alloys that were an option for that year. I was assuming that
&gt; this would be 'easy' but discussion on this list has me nervous now!
