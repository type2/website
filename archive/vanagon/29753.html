Subject: Re: '71 Westy rear drum removal

A
&gt;&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that I could 
&gt;&gt; &gt; remove the drums without removing the 46mm nut.  Is this true?  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; NO! You have to remove the nut. Get the right tool and use a hammer
&gt;&gt; on the tool as well as a long breaker bar. 

Now wait just a minute i have a '71 westy (Production date Aug '70) with
front disc brakes,  and i have removed the rear drums WITHOUT REMOVING THE
EXCUSE ME NUT!  There are two small bolts, 10mm i believe that hold the drum
to the hub.  Remove those two nuts, bang on the drum( if neccessary) with
your B.F.H. and low and behold off with that drumm without getting half of
your neighborhood to stand on your cheater bar.  trust me.
