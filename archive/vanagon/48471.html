     Unplug O2 sensor and see if it will run. If not check all
     wiring to Temperature sensor. I will bet it's 1 of these 2
     units!

&gt; Hello Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; This is my first post as a havabusser. Up to now I have just been one of
&gt; those snivelling lurkers.;)
&gt; 
&gt; I have owned a 78 Westy, affectionately named Nellie, for the past three
&gt; months. She is my first vw and we quickly fell in love with each other --
&gt; that is up until last week.
&gt; 
&gt; For about 200 miles she would often stall a few minutes after being
&gt; started. Felt like low rpm and if I revved the engine for a while, the
&gt; stalling would go away. She never stalled when she was hot. She usually
&gt; stalled when the engine was around 120 degrees.
&gt; 
&gt; So, last week when she was at about 120 degrees she did something
&gt; different. She lost power and I was unable to rev her up and prevent
&gt; stalling. From then on, I have only been able to run the engine for about a
&gt; minute before she dies.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought this vehicle with no illusions that work would be involved.
&gt; Besides, I know I will enjoy her more if I know what the hell is going on
&gt; in the back.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions as to what I should test?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. - I am in digest mode so please respond to me directly.
