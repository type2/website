Subject: Another cool Vanagon seen

	At my local organic grocery store today, parked closer to the
Barnes and Noble bookstore, an off-white Vanagon Synchro double cab
pick-up. Be still my heart!! I left my card on the drivers door, saying
something intelligent like:

	COOL Truck!
	Call me if you ever want to sell it or just chat.

	Had Santa Cruz parking stickers and a Wolf bra. What a pretty,
pretty vehicle!

	Bill
