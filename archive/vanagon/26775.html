&gt; Anyway, Bentley says to remove the filler tube, an overflow tube here,

&gt; *see* where the overflow tubes connect, let alone get my grubby hands in
&gt; there to do it.

If it's like the 81, the overflow tubes connect to the top of the tank.  
I can reach mine through the wheel well behind the wheel, but I can't see 
them.n

&gt; 1) since there isn't gas gushing out, am I right in assuming that it's
&gt;    probably just an overflow hose that's popped loose, or a grommet
&gt;    that's failed, rather than something more serious like a hole in the
&gt;    tank? 

Nope.  Could be a rusted through hole.  But I'd start on the premise that 
the overflow line is cracked/popped off first (just because it's not as 
painful as thinking about a new/used tank).

&gt; 2) has this happened to anyone else?

Yep.  The top of the tank had rusted through and seeped gas until the 
level went below the hole.  Pulled it several times, tried patching it, 
finally had to put a used one in.

&gt; 3) Bentley makes tank removal sound simple but, like I said, you can't
&gt;    even see some of those hose connections.  How much of a pain in the
&gt;    rear is it really?

Pretty big, the first few times.  You get the hang of it after the 5th 
time or so :).  I'll repost the article I wrote about tank removal if 
you're interested.  Mostly you have to make sure the tank is almost 
completely empty and then take your time about it.
