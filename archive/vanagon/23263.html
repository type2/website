Subject: Caravan(bus?) to Wailaki.

Well, martha tells me that Jeff is going to caravan up to Wailaki with 
us.  I think we'll be leaving Martha's place at about 10am Friday.  Does 
anyone alse want to tag along?  I have 2 portable CBs I can loan out for 
the drive, and I guess Jeff will get one of them unless he bought a CB 
lately.

Also, Martha said that if anyone wants they can crash at her place the 
night before, and maybe even have a party.

Bradley
