Subject: Outrageous Prices.

Now, I know that we drive our dubbers because we love the
ride and uniqueness of haveing a VW.

people actually paid of these cars)

Hell, with prices like this, I figure that I MAY just take
that welding and painting class at the community college.
Then go out and scour the junkyards and old barns of this
great land.

Yahoo, Im sitting on a gold mine! (Or the ground, if I don't
weld up that rust spot on the seat tracks!)
