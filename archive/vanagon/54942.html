Subject: STAT CHANGE: Syncronized in Kansas!

Hi Vanagonauts!

After a painstaking search for a Vanagon Syncro that took place largely
through this Vanagon list, I have finally found the Syncro of my liking
and actually purchased it.  I found it locally through a lead at my local
VW FLAPS, believe it or not.  I'm in a bit of Nirvana-gon right now since
I just bought it this evening and it's now in my drive sitting behind my
84 GL Brownie Bus.  Syncros are pretty scarce around Kansas City.

The Syncro we named 'Big Blue' and he's an 86 non-Westy, medium blue,
100k by the original owner purchased locally.  The 5 speed tranny mainshaft
brgs have been replaced along with one head and both head gaskets at 90K.
New clutch, exhaust parts, recent tires, very good body &amp; interior, and
the original AM/FM cassette.  All this for *quite* a bit less than other I
have been looking into!  The things it needs are: lf headlight, a htr
cable install, and rear hatch struts.  That's it!!!  A very clean vehicle.

Soo.., I have 2 84 Vanagons for sale and I also have some good leads for
anyone looking for Synrcos in the Midwest/Plains states.  Thanks to
everyone who helped me with my search, but I guess 'there is no place like
home'--just like Dorothy said about Kansas in the Wizard of Oz!  8-)
