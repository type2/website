&gt; I've watched and waited but lately, no one has brought up shocks--So
&gt; here goes.
&gt;
&gt; My creame puff 84 Westy needs a more stable ride, she needs to toughen
&gt; up a bit!
&gt;
&gt; I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific shocks.  I would
&gt; like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions and have a
&gt; frugal budget.
