Subject: A trip report... 2 EV sightings!

Well, my honey and I made a trip to northern virgina last weekend in our 71 
camper.  The trip up there was pretty boring until, on I-66, the bus started 
pinging like crazy.  We pulled over and I loosened the dist. clamp to retard 
the timing.  I backed it off untill is was sounding good, and we progressed. 
 I had been running it at 10 BTDC static, and it tuns out that I retarded it 
to exactly 7.5 BTDC.  Go figure.  She ran great after that.  While in 
Sterling, VA I set out to check up on some VW's that I had seen before.  
There is a guy in Sterling Park who has 2 60's spilt windows.  One is parked 
out in front of his place, sadly rusting away.  To make matters worse, this 
baby is one of those ones with _all_ the windows, skylights and a sunroof.
I dunno if he is planning to restore any of these.  There is also a guy down 
the street who has a 74 thing that would make Martha crazy and morgage the 
house.  It is in very good shape, all pretty bonestock, with the least rust 
on any unrestored VW I have seen on his coast.  I talked with the owner for 
a while, and he isn't interested in selling it ... bummer. 

So, we headed off on Sunday afternoon down I-81.  Around Harrisonburg, A EV 
passed by in the usual manner.  That is, I am going 65, he is going much 
faster.  Struggle as I may, it is futile.  Anyway, about a half hour later, 
_another_ EV passed me, a different color.  Now, with the EV population as 
it is, what is the probability of this happening?  Two EV's in 1/2 an hour?

Other than the above, the trip was pretty uneventfull.  The bus averaged 
19.6 MPG both ways, even with the timing change before we left.
