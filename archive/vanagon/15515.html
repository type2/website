Subject: Re: Replacing Stock 82 Van mirrors w/stronger model


Howdy all,

I had the same problem on my '81, but not with the post pulling out
of the mirror.  What I found was that the aluminum post and &quot;backing
washer&quot; for the spring would seize together over time.  Once that
happened no amount of spring tightening would get things right again.

Through liberal use of WD40 and various tools, I was able to remove
the washer from the post.  Then I filed down the flats on the post
until the washer slid easily over it.  A liberal application of grease
prevents them from seizing up again.  After this &quot;treatment&quot;, small
changes in bolt adjustment result in big changes in degrees of tight-
ness.  Grease the ball and cup arrangement lightly as well since their
proximity to the elements causing a certain amount of seizure as well.

YMMV, but it's worked fine on both mirrors (after experiencing
increasingly worse sag) for two years now.  Sandpaper would probably
work as well on the post as the jewelers file I used.  You just want
to remove enough metal to allow the washer to move up and down the
shaft easily.  Or you can be smarter than I was and remove the metal
from inside the hole in the washer.
