Subject: Re: US 1997 Eurovan VR6?

Here in Canada, we have been assured that the Winnebago conversion 
will indeed be available with the VR6.  The engine will be detuned 
to offer greater torque.  Unfortunately Winnebago insists that all 
vehicles will be automatic transmission.

I have the 5-speed 5-cylinder, and like it very much.

BTW, the delta for the new engine is expected to be about 
Cdn$9,000 (!!!).  That makes it about Cdn$50,000 (!!!).
