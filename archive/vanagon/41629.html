Subject: Cold Start Problem

Hello,

I have an 82 fuel injected gas Vanagon.  Started getting hard to
start late this winter.  Tuned it up, new thermostat, new cyl.
head temp sensor.  Runs great once started, but still doesn't 
like to start when cold.

Knowledgeable friend says I need new air flow sensor.  YIKES! 
Big $$$!  Any other ideas?  Thanks.
