Subject: Help with stripped threads

My wife finally used the term &quot;Money Pit&quot; when referring to my 83.5 Westy that 
I've had for 3 months now.  After yesterdays $500 repair she's ready to scrap 
this thing.  I'm on thin ice right now.  (Please insert prayer for my van 
here).  My current problem is one of the bolts I used to put the exhaust back 
on after I put new heads on was too long and striped the threads.  After a 
while it has blown the gasket and is real noisy now.  If I go get this fixed, 
that will be the end of my van I'm sure of it.  What is the &quot;cheapest&quot; way to 
fix this temporarily at least.  I don't care if the repair only lasts 6 
months, I have to do it myself.  Any suggestions (and prayers) would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Bryan

bought it 60K miles ago...)
