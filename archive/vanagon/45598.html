Subject: Re: Review of Bus Boys

FWIW:  I have ordered twice from Bus Boys and have been satisfied with
price/value/service each time. A catalog was enclosed with my second order.

Originally, I requested a catalog that was never sent (requested 3 years
ago) but Jim exchanged messages with me about a seal I needed, the deal was
done, and I have used them since that first sale, 1 year ago.  The catalog
snafu did greatly irritate me but the other successful encounters have
balanced that out. As with anything else, YRMV.
