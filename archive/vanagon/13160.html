Sounds like the thermostat, at least that's the only thing I can think of
that has a wire coming out of it (Does it look like an accordian?).  Yes,
it is importatnt - it should wrap around a pulley and then head up through
a grommet in the engine tin to the horizontal rod  that opens and closes
the flaps between the fan housing and the cylinder shrouding.  You can
remove it and place it in boiling water to test it - it should expand quite
dramatically.

&gt; Howdy, all...
&gt; I am a bit concerned about a part on my engine that I am unable to
&gt;identify. I have a 1.7l pancaker with dual-carbs and the part in
&gt;question is some type of heat-switch located under the engine on the
&gt;passenger's side. It's a round thing with a cable coming out (which
&gt;isn't presently connected to anything. Should I be worried about this?
&gt; Is it part of the heating system? If so, it won't be much help any
&gt;more. (I just finished manufacturing a *COMPLETE* exhaust system out
&gt;of a set of headers, thus no more heat exchangers to worry about...)
&gt; Thanx
