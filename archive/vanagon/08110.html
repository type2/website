&gt; 
&gt; Last month on this list, someone had mentioned putting a Ford O2 sensor 
&gt; in as a replacement for the expensive factory item.  Does this really 
&gt; work?  If it does, could I get the part number again?
&gt; 

I have been using the Ford/Mercury Bosch sensor with no problems.  It comes
pre-smeared with anti-seize, so all you have to do is move the connector from
your old one to the new one, and screw it in.  At the parts counter, have the
guy/gal pull the stock sensor with the Ford, and you'll see that they're identical
except for the  connector.  I soldered the wires together, since they hang down 
where water and stuff splashes on them, and I'd rather not have corrosion causing
bad signals a few years down the road. 

On the receipt:  0258-003-913  3-wire Oxy sensor $65.19

On the box were the numbers: 610328 021 13913.  13913 were also in big numbers
on the end of the box.  This oxy sensor is for Ford/Mercury cars, and does 
not have the correct plug, so you have to use the connector from your old 
sensor.
