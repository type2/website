Subject: CV Stuck: NOT!

Thanks to all the helpful advice re: the stuck CV joint. I did manage to
get it apart by tapping at the right place with a short wooden dowel
(hammer driven) as the CV sat just right atop 2 - 2x4's. Only took about 2
minutes. The trick was that I didn't try to fix it until I really
understood the problem (through all the helpful e-mail from you all). I was
able to determine that the side with the wide spacing between balls was the
side that would come out first, so tapping on that side created instant
success.

By the way, I did wipe down the dowel carefully before I started.

Hope this post helps anyone else who encounters the same problem in the future.

Again, thanks!
