Subject: Re: Cinderblock thru Van window

&gt;Whenever my friend Kevin takes his '85 Weekender into Philly, he knows he
&gt;takes its life in his hands...
&gt;
&gt;This weekend somebody threw a cinder block through the driver's side
&gt;sliding window.     :-(

I just emailed him my experiences on that.  I had the same thing happen
(same year van, other side window) to my bus before i bought it.  I had my
window replaced with a window from a '80.  it works but its not to nice,
it's not as smooth as the other side's and the latch is loose so i have to
pull the latch up into the groove and hope that noone can get around it and
thus get into my beloved bus.  I was wondering if anyone knows what to do,
how can i tighten the latch, it slips around on the glass??
