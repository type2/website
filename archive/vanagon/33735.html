Subject: 71 flat spots and general nastiness.

Joe,
I haven't been following this thread because whenever I see the &quot;71 
 Westie&quot; I get tears in my eyes and can't continue. BUT on my old van 
 (gawd I miss her) had bad times as soon as the weather turned cold. It 
 would die as I was moving out of a stoplight or require really fancy 
 footwork to keep it running at low rpms. I checked it all, replaced 
 the distributor with a 009, played with the mixture, moved the timing 
 around and finally gave up and turned it over to a professional. He 
 put on a new 34PICT 3 and it was all fixed. It seems that my carb was 
 worn enough in the shafts, butterflies and jets that the change in air 
 density from summer to winter was making it whacky. I was suspect that 
 this was true but the bus ran like a champion all winter long and 
 every winter till I sold her...sob.
