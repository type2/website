&gt;   Question: Should the air which comes out of the rear-passenger ceiling
&gt;             vents be warm? I had tons of airflow of cold air, no matter what
&gt;             I tried I couldn't get rear heat. The front heat was fine though.

The ceiling vents only deliver fresh air, which could be warm or cold 
depending on the outside temp. :-)  One thing I like about the four-lever
system is its simplicity... top lever for air delivery to the windshield,
next lever down for temp, next lever for footwell air deliver, and the
bottom lever for the rear fresh air.  The levers have a different feel to
them:  The levers for the windshield and footwell are smooth, and the other
two levers have bumps on them.  Since these bumpy and smooth levers 
alternate, going from top to bottom, its easy to adjust the flow of air and
temp without taking your eyes off the road!

Kudos to the VW engineers!
