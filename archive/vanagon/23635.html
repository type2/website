&gt; Steve, I'm no expert (but getting smarter about this every day,
&gt; unfortunately) but  I've been told this condition does not turn your engine
&gt; into a hand grenade waiting to go off. It will, however, limit the
&gt; long-term life (mileage) of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The defect is covered under VWs 5 yr/50,000 mile powertrain warranty. That
&gt; means they'll fix it for free. I'd recommend you contact your dealer before
&gt; reaching 50k miles and have them check it out. I'm thinking this problem is
&gt; probably more widespread than suspected.

Thanks loads for the info! We're all packed, and we hit the road bright and 
early (for us that's 10:00) tomorrow!

I'll post a note to the list when we're back in MN and back on-line.

Steve
