Subject: Re: Type IV engine - somewhat off topic.

&gt;  Ever drive a 914?  I liked it better than the 912.  Better handling; 
&gt;  peppy.  And it was less expensive to maintain.  What a sports car used 
&gt;  to be!

I had one new and loved it, and I'm looking for another one. My mom had
three that my brother crashed one after another before they started
hiding the car keys. And even _more_ off topic, my daughter has decided
that she wants a bug convertible. Is there a bug mailing list I should
be monitoring?
