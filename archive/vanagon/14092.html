Subject: 65 transaxle - help!

Some part of my drive train (on my 65 Deluxe) is faily load as I cruise
down the highway.  I suspect it's the transmission and not the reduction
gears.  When I coast (i.e., put in the clutch) noise reaches the normal
level that I'm use to.  Aren't the reduction gears still rotating?  I 
haven't check out the manuals - but I pretty sure the trans. is indicating
a major problem is coming in the near future.  Its a loud whine/growl-
worst in 4th and under a load (going up an incline).  What trans. can be
interchanged? 60-67?  Should I switch from swing axle to post '67 IRSs?
Can I pull the transaxle w/o removing engine?  Anybody?  Thanx in advance.
At least the weather's improving.
