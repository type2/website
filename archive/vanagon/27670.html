&gt; First, is anyone aware of the new emissions testing laws in NJ, and
&gt; how they are likely to affect various models of buses?  My
&gt; understanding of the law as it exists (i.e. it has already been signed
&gt; into law), is that there will be one emissions standard, typical of
&gt; the requirements for &quot;modern&quot; cars (with FI, catalytic converters,
&gt; etc.).  The law does NOT make exception for the age of the vehicle or
&gt; the emissions standards when the car was produced.

As I understand it the NY version of this law has also existed for a while
(more than a year), but is still not implemented here in the more
remote parts of NY state (Rochester). I found some info about it
at DMV about a year ago. That info stated that there would be different
requirements for vehicles of different age. Again this was NY, and
things may also have changed since then.

&gt;     Hey this is the kind of hocus pocus scare i've been waiting for.  
&gt; Lest go to NJ and buy all these VWs CHEAP!! We'll make alot of money 
&gt; selling them in NV or any other non &quot;smog paranoid&quot; state.
&gt; 
&gt;     This also will boost property values in neighboring states; all 
&gt; those NJ residents fleeing a socialist regime.

Socialist? Hmmm, I don't think so. Who do you think is going to pocket
the profits from increased new car sales? 

And note that this law in no way prevents you from buying a new &quot;sports
utility vehicle&quot; with a 5+ liter V8 just to drive around town, and to
the bar. A more socialistic measure would be to give you a certain
pollution quota you can spend each year, and then it's up to you which
car you spend it with. This might amount to (wild guesses):

	 &lt; 1000 miles with old, out of tune, V8 Detroit iron
	2500 - 5000 with your vw bus, depending on condition
	7500 for your neighbors brand new BMW 733
	12000+ for his wife's generic compact or subcompact.

Ok, I know this isn't practical. I think even Sweden have given up
taxing according to usage nowdays. (Diesels used to be taxed on the
odometer reading each year. One reason was that it would be ineffective
to place a high tax on the fuel. People would just start puming their
own oil from untaxed heating oil.)
