         Manifold Destiny

Why, I recall 'twas just last year,
Around Thanksgiving time,
I went to see my buddy Joe,
And rang his doorbell chime.

His wife came to the door and said,
&quot;He ain't at home right now.
He's out a'driving on the road
In that Vee-Dub bus, The Cow.&quot;

So I took myself along on home
Along the coastal road,
When who'd I see, but that old Joe,
On the shoulder where he'd whoa'd!

Old Joe was back behind the bus,
A'poking round the rear,
He had that engine hatch propped up
And was pouring something clear.

I stopped in front and walked on back
To see if he was broke,
But he had closed the engine hatch
And was sipping on a Coke.

He said he couldn't stop to talk,
Important was his quest,
With miles to go before he quits
For dinner and a rest.

He pulled out in the traffic lanes
And hurried up to speed,
I tagged along behind his bus ...
Some help he might yet need.

In about ten miles, he stopped again,
And behind the bus he'd go,
Where he pulled that same old pouring stunt,
On what, I didn't know.

Then off he'd roar, back on the road
For another ten miles more,
Where he would stop and run around
Behind the bus to pour.

He kept this up back to the house,
Where he called out to his wife,
Who came on out and walked right back
To the engine with a knife!

She poked inside, then poked some more,
And then she said, &quot;I'll bet
You need once more around the block ...
The turkey ain't done yet.&quot;
