Subject: Re: EV Tires

Not exactly answering the question asked....

When we had a tire destroyed by road debris we went to a &quot;Just Tires&quot; 
which is owned by I believe GoodYear.  To get the right size they had to 
go to a Good Year imported tire - that is made in England model G64.  
These were the originals on my EV and I am happy with them.  Noisy tires 
maybe but hold the road well.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; The Conti's on the EV MV are just about toast. Flatspots and a host of other
&gt; problems. I am having a VERY hard time finding replacements of any kind. I am
&gt; finding non reinforced all over the place but cannot find reinforced. 
&gt; 
&gt; How big a deal is a reinforced tire? I do not haul anything heavier than
&gt; people and bicycles. No boats, trailers, or anything like that.
&gt; 
&gt; That ever lovin' input would be greatly appreciated.....
&gt;
