Subject: Re: Hydrolic valve adjustment?

Sounds like you've got a collapsed lifter.If you can push with your 
finger on the bottom of the rocker arm and it goes in then replace the 
lifter(they are about $10 ).Two turns in after zero clearance is 
correct..COLD!

&gt; Having replaced a broken rocker arm stud on my 1980 2. litre I proceeded to

&gt; cylinders. Then I redid it leaving the little play I felt in the Hydrolic
&gt; tappets, but leaving no gap between the adjustment screw and the valve stem.
&gt; Now they seem too loose.
&gt;    1. Should I be feeling a little play in the tappets at all?
&gt;     2. If so should I adjust it out?
&gt;      3. Should I do the operation hot or cold?
&gt;        
&gt; Any help you could give would be most appreciated. Thanks,
