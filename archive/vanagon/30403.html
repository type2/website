Hello,
This is my first posting and I am excited that there are people out 
ther that have some of the same problems that I do. I have two '81 
Vanagon Westphalia's one with fuel inj. the other with a carb. other 
than that they are exactly the same. This weekend I am attempting to 
do a tune-up and explore why my starter doesn't want to work 
sometimes. The stater just clicks and does nothing. The battery is 
good and the alternator checks out fine. Any suggestions? 
P.S. the fuel inj. Vanagon is for sale if anyone is interested (South 
Carolina)
