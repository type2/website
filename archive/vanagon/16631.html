Subject: More on Bosch 050


A personal email asked for more details on the Bosch 050 distributor.  I 
was told that it is a centrifugal advance, like the 009.  But this one 
does not retard the spark for #3 cylinder, unlike the 009.  Apparently 
the #3 ran hot in type I engines, and maybe the dual-carb type IV 
engines.  But for 74-79 van (type IV with fuel injection) I was told that 
050 was the way to go.  Sure enough, when I tried an 009, I could not get 
my 76 to start up.

Has anyone ever used one of these before?   How are they timed?

Jesse Reynolds
