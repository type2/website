Subject: My new '91 Westie

Hi everybody. Glad to join the list, which I've been reading for a long
time and was a very good reference for the recent purchase of a '91
Westie (name search in progress). Just in case anyone is interested, its
a bordeaux, 4-sp, full camper, alloys, power everything, 80,000 miles,
one owner, VW stereo, hitch, bra, very clean; paid $16,500. I know, it
may sound expensive to you east coasters, but around here (Eugene, OR)
that is reasonable, or so I think.
The mechanic that did the pre-purchase inspection (which specializes in
VWs)said that the only thing he found was a leaking head, and said that
this was a minor thing and that it would cost about $70 to fix. Since
I've read so much about those #*&amp;% heads in the list ,and certain
plastic component that melts down, etc. I was wondering how &quot;minor&quot; this
is, and if I should have it fixed right away. Would this be the time to
replace the plastic component for the metal one that is mentioned in the
list? As you can see, I'm pretty much confused, so any lead will be
useful _at_ this point.

Just found something worth exploring:
&quot;1991, VW Vanogon (sic), $9,450. Conversion/camper, manual transmission,
GL, original owner, excel. condition, fully eqpd., new tires, 4-speed.
For sale by private party. (703)620-2449 [Day]. Virginia.&quot; 

Cheers,

Cris.
