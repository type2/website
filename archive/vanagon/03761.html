I have a 78 Westfailure, that has the pipe rusted off that seems to have
gone to the weird gasheater underneath the van. Is this the pipe you
guys are talking about? I have only owned pre-74 Westies before that had
the gasheater in the engine compartment. This one is under a pan on the
bottom of the van. There appears to be the remnants of a pipe coming from
it towards the motor (heater Boxes?). I'd appreciate any help on this,
as winter is on it's way.
Regards,
Courtney
