Subject: Re: Let's make this large list EASIER ! !

I agree that this list needs some order.  And one way to do this is to have
more specific subject lines.  However, I'm not sure that hard and fast
rules are needed.  But people should be more specific in their subjects.

 This list has become a chore to keep up with and since I get almost as
many messages from the Corrado list, my life has become consumed with mail
lists!

Many of the messages are not read because it is so laborious to wade
through the messages which may or may not be of ones interest.  And that is
a shame.

I also think that there needs to be a greater use of paragraphs in long
messages.  These huge massess of text with out spacing are difficult to
read, especially if you're sufting through a hundred or so.
