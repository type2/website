So L.S.Griffiths_at_physics.salford.ac_dot_uk says:
&gt;      
&gt;      I finally went down to London and picked up the '61 single cab on 
&gt;      Saturday.

&gt;      It was a 3 hour train journey then a 5 hour! drive back at an average 
&gt;      of about 45mph (230miles).

Congrads on your recent acquisition Lee!  Now, I actually have a VW in
common with yours!  :)
I know that first drive home, can be a shakey one!  Just ask Thom F. :)
At least I could drive mine home.  The VWs Thom gets for himself usually 
have to be swept up into a dust pan and then re-assembled in his 
garage. ;)

&gt;      impressed by the lack of heat, my legs nearly froze :(

The system probably just needs some bits or tweeking.  I would imagine
a single cab should easily get as warm as a bug.

&gt;      The damn thing is so rust free though I can't believe it :)

OOOOOOOOOoooo I'm so jealous!  I've got lots of rust to contend with,
not to mention a couple of holes to repair.   

&gt;      tilt and canvas which I put up yesterday and it looks cool.
                ^^^^^^

Ahhhh, the Holy Grail for single cabs.  :)

&gt;      Where does the spare wheel go ?

Well, if it's like mine, it is clamped to the upper bed inside the
storage bay.

&gt;      Where is the chassis plate ?

The VIN#?  That (with some help from friends) is up on the passenger
side of the ventilation distributor.

It's also stamped in the right hand side (towards the rear bottom) of
the engine compartment sheet metal.

Good luck with your new baby!
