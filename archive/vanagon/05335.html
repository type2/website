&gt;the typical pop-top, which I believe is made out of some sort of
&gt;fiberglass-type material, white.  From the years of exposure,

Martha,

	One option would be to re-coat it with a layer of resin, much like is 
used on boats and surfboards.  This will trap the fibers and keep them 
from further delaminating.  This coating can then be painted, or, if 
you like, you can add pigment to your resin, although this weakens it 
slightly.  Done in moderation its OK.  Even with the piment, you can
still paint over it.

	Be careful sanding on it though - you will creat little airborne
fiberglass hairs which irritate the skin and can cause silicosis.  I've
developed rashes seveal times from working on surfboards and getting
it in my skin!  Wear a respirator - not a 25 cent mask!
