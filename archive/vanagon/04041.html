Subject: Re: kooltrons


I have used the Igloo &quot;kooltron&quot; for over a year now. We use it in
the EV for long trips. I remove the jump seat from behind the
front passenger seat and put the kooltron there. I use the seatbelt
from the jumpseat to anchor it in place.

I paid $90 for the large one at the local wholesale club. It came
with the 110 adapter, which is nice 'cause you can take the cooler out
of the van at night and plug it into the motel's electricity and
have cold beers, etc in the room.

Cetin asked about the heating side of the cooler. Last thanksgiving
I cooked a turkey (yep...i have some domestic qualities) for a
family gathering in Boston (60 miles from home). We put the turkey
in the cooler...reversed the current to warm....and voila...hot
turkey!
