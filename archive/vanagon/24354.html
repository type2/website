&gt; This sounds so funny to me.  I'm picturing this long line of people paying
&gt; five dollars to stand in a little tent about the size of a portable latrine.
&gt; I'm sure it's a well marked spot!! :) ;) :)  

As far as I remember they weren't charging for that  when I went some 15-20 
years ago.  You don't even get a tent.  Just a 5 inch brass marker ina 
stone floor that you can stand on.  My smart alec father put one finger 
in four states at one time for a photo.

We went there in our '72 VW Campmobile - see how easily VWs can be 
brought back in....
