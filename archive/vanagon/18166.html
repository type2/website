Subject: curtain holders: 71 campmobile

I have a '71 pop top with a slotted strip of aluminum on the top of the 
sliding door frame to hang a curtain.  Does anyone know where to get the 
little sliders that go in that slot from which to hang a curtain?  P.S.
how do you post a message instead of a reply (I'm new)?
Thanks
