Boy did you guys miss a sight!  Sunday, we removed the front wheels from the
'79 by means of me standing on one side of a 2' X-wrench, holding the other,
and bouncing a bit.  Fortunately, there was a list member behind me to catch
me as I went ass over teakettle, and four more to laugh.  I HATE MECHANICS
WHO ARE SO DAMN PROUD OF THEIR 600 FT/LB PNEUMATIC WRENCHES!!!!
