&gt; 
&gt; Two more questions for the list dwellers:
&gt; 
&gt; - the first is a simple one: anyone know either what kind of plastic the
&gt; camper tops are usually made of, or better yet, any good ways to repair a
&gt; couple of small cracks in it before they turn into big cracks? I say
&gt; usually because this is a non-Westphalia camper conversion, made by VSI in
&gt; Calif.) I've thought about metal plates drilled through but I'm wondering
&gt; about alternatives.
&gt; 

If you can get to the back side of the crack, or if you're not too worried
about looks on the outside, you can fix it by using a two-part epoxy and
some fiberglass tape.  I repaired a kayak with large (3&quot;-4&quot;) cracks, and
am able to put all my weight on the (fixed) cracked part, and it flexes like
new.

If you decide to do this, clean the area around the crack.  Cut a piece of
2&quot; fiberglass tape (with woven edges.  don't use frayed-edged tape) that
extends about 2&quot; past the end of the crack.  Smear a layer of epoxy about
1&quot; or 2&quot; bigger than the tape.  Put the tape on this layer of epoxy, then
put another layer on top of the tape.

If you have to do this on the outside, buy some micro-balloons (or micro
spheres, different name), and mix it in the epoxy.  This gives the epoxy
an opaque white color, which will hide the fiberglass tape better.

At my local supply house, 2&quot; fiberglass tape is 40 cents a yard, a life-
time supply of micro-balloons is $5, and epoxy is about $4 for the smallest
cans.

Let me know if you have any questions.

-Jim
