Subject: Re: '86 Vanagon Head Gasket Leaks


It is possible to get VW to pay 100% of the cost of replacing the heads and gaskets when they leak.  This covered by the FTC consent decree that resulted from the rabbit oil sucking problem. I just got my 87 Syncro's heads replaced gratis. If you have bills from such a repacement you might get paid through this approach.  There is a Better Business Bureau arbitration procedure you need to invoke.  The BBB program is called &quot;autoline&quot;.
