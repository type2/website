Subject: Van names...

I drove the EV to work last week, and we decided to go out to lunch.
Naturally,  I took this opportunity to show off the EV (which I had recently
cleaned after the shame I felt at the Philly gathering :-),  It turned out
I had a total of seven people and their weights averaged about 190 pounds.

I noticed that the EV's ride  actually felt a lot cushier and I was not feeling
the cigarette butts that I drive over anymore....  The engine did not even
seem to notice the weight...

 &gt; &quot;Mommy Van&quot;.

 &gt; Didja ever notice how EuroVans (and I'm sure other VW vans) seem
 &gt; to run &quot;happy&quot; when its hauling the family and out on the
 &gt; highway? Mine does!
