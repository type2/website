&gt; &gt;  Hi,  Would it be that the tire diameters can't be more than 6%
&gt; &gt; different in diameter? Or would gear ratios play a part in the equasion?
&gt; &gt; If it is just Tire diameters you can take the exact diameters of each
&gt; &gt; tire and mathimatically figure the percentage of the difference in size.
&gt; 
&gt;         The quote from the manual said 6% across the viscous coupling, but
&gt; if the final drive ratios are the same for the front final drive and the
&gt; rear final drive (which they would have to be if we are supposed to use the
&gt; same size tires on all four wheels right?), the gear ratios cancel each other
&gt; out. So you would be able to calculate the allowable difference for a given
&gt; tire size based only on the diameter. Also, I would think one should allow
&gt; a bit of headroom for going around corners where the back wheels will not
&gt; take the same track as the front wheels and thus will not be turning at the
&gt; same rate.

Hi Dave,  Yep, I think you are right. The usage of percent instead of
degrees kind of made me think. I guess 6% would be 21.6 degrees of
slippage in every revolution of the vc. Sure seems like a lot.  Todd
