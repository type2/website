Wow! I was thinking about something like this today! I'd LOVE to have 
technical or production drawings of my '76 Campmobile. Please pass any

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 	I am looking to obtain a set of blueprints, exterior dimensions

&gt; these can be obtained I would appreciate it if you could drop me a line at:

&gt; I would greatly appreciate any input.  I'm planning on building a scaled
