Ernesto,
Pretty wide range. I would be suspicious of any estimate nearest the $1000 end,
if labor is included. Probably goes w/o saying that you should be sure to get a
134a system. I got three estimates on mine. One was $1200, two were $1300. That
was only to repair and convert my existing system to 134a, so a lot of the
(working) parts I already had. The second $1300 estimate didn't even include the
labor to reinstall everything; only the necessary reconditioning of the
evaporator, condensor, and the new hoses, compressor, reciever/dryer, and misc.
small parts. Needless to say, I decided to move to Wisconsin rather than fork
out the bucks for AC.
I'm curious what kind of evaporator/air handler you're looking at having
installed in the cab? Is it overhead or under dash? Got any names of companies
you want to pass around?
