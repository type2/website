Subject:      Sighting in Sweden

When I was on a little trip in the south of Sweden, I saw a Vanagon bus
with the badge &quot;Camping&quot; on the hatch. The badge had same fonts as the
Wolkswagen badge so I guess its made by VW. I guess the year to 82-86
something. It had a small poptop, just as long as the sliding door and
no Westfalia marks. It had german license plates. All poptops I've seen
here was made by Westfalia.
