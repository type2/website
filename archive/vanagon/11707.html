&gt; It was &quot;Magic Bus&quot;!  And man, does it fit:-)  I'd swear its about my '66!
&gt; I suggest all to run out and get it.

Was that the first time you had heard the song?
Check out the original version on the Pete Townshend &quot;Scoop&quot; disc.  Amazing
what one man can accomplish in a home studio.
