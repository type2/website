Subject: weird bus sighting

Hey, I've seen a strange looking bus in the Flagstaff area a few times,
and I thought I'd share it with y'all.

It's probably early '60's vintage, and grafted to the top is the
top portion of a Beetle!  The beetle top is facing rearward, so
when you stand up in the Bus and look forward, you are about eye
level with the Beetle rear window!  The Beetle side windows are
in place, also.  I wonder if they roll down?
