Subject: Warning Baja Virus!

I heard a hoax from SOMEONE ELSE that goes something like :

You are likely to get carpal tunnel, cause complete failure of the NORAD,
turn the all of the lights out in New York State and all of your posts will
automatically be routed to alt.lifestyle.liteloafers if you suggest baja-ing
anything that hasn't been totaled, crushed, ruined by a 16 year old and
rusted to death. I know recycled oats when I see it.
