Subject: Spare Parts Wish list 91 Carat

I am traveling to VW salavage yard that has several late 88-91 vanagons.
Since I have been reading various notes about electric window mtrs and
switches, fuel pumps, somthing about the air flow sensor, O2 sensor and
etc.  Is there a recommended wish list of things I could stock up on if
their available? Things to avoid and get new? I'd be willing to shop for
some things for that hard to find item or whatever if it helps you.
