Hi,
	There is a large white plastic gear in the wiper motor that
spins.  In the center of this gear is rod that comes out of the motor
that eventuly gets your wipers moving.  When this happened to me, the
rod had worn down the hole in the white gear where it was attatched.
I had the same symptoms, could hear the motor spinning, but no go.
Pull the wiper away from the window and they moved...  
I found a old wiper motor in a junkyard, you may be able to JBWeld the
parts together if you have the same problem?

take care,
	brandy
