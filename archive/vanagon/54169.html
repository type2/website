Subject: Recall of 1991 Vanagon - Fire danger


For the listee who was wondering about a recall of the 1991 Vanagon for 
possible gas leaks, here it is, right off the NHTSA's web site.  I would 
have replied direct, but I inadvertently deleated the original posting.  
Sorry all for the wasted bandwith.
