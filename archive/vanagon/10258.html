&gt; &gt; between 70 and 80 mph.  Ever notice the way that a diesel 
&gt; &gt; loosens out after 50 or 60 miles?  And that it revs better with 

&gt; engine just runs *better* after an hour. It is quieter (or I am deafer)
&gt; and runs much more smoothly....
Well, I guess there's three of us lunatics here.  Mine runs better after
about 70 miles or so.  Strange thing, but there must be a reason for it.
I've pretty well decided that truck drivers know this already and therefore
let the engines run all night, even when it is not cold outside.
