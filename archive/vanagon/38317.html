Subject: Leo Carillo Campout

Thanks to anyone who made this a personal outing for themselves last 
weekend, and in addtition, my apologies if I did not get the chance to 
see you as I wandered about the campsite somewhat aimlessly. There were 
half a dozen of so beautiful busses gracing the camp site with their 
presence. Makes me proud to be an American. Thanks Dan for the tour of 
your splitty...beauty. The Coca-Cola bottle opener was the icing on the 
cake. Hopefully I can show mine off to you next time! Well, the fires 
were ragings, the conversation was bubbling, and the trip was a great way 
for me, and hopefully a few of you to end your month with...
Now while the camping was good, some bad karma struck me on the way out 
there and hopefully I can get by with a little help with my friends.
I got the old red light on in the dash telling me something is funny with 
the electrics of the van. (To update, it's a '69) Now it isn't the 
full-on bright hey stupid wake up and stop the engine bright, but it's a 
dim red that goes out at idle and builds up with the RPM's, reaching at 
cruising speed about 50-60% of it's brightness. I thinking it's the 
regulator or hopefully not, the generator. But the problem it that it's 
intermittent. On the way there, the red light was on. Fortunately, my 
battery still had enough juice left to crank over the next morning, a 
struggled start at that, but nonetheless a start, and ran perfectly fine 
all the way back home. It was good all day Saturday, then yesterday, the 
same bad karma struck me. Enough of my side, if any of you have any 
suggestions to offer, I would be much oblidged.

One other note. I remember page surfing through VW trends a few months 
ago and they had a clip of a motorcycle frame with a aircooled VW-4 
cylinder for weebos. I think I remember the copy saying something about 
it being swiss. Any takers on this mystery?

Thanks for all those who suffered through to the end of this message!
