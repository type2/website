Subject: Cold and afraid of Route 80

Hi y'all - 

It's Anton, the newbie with the new '71 Westy. She's sitting in a shop right 
now - figured before taking her to Minnesota from New York, I'd better have a 
STM (Smarter Than Me) take a look at her and give me a thumbs up... 

He, however, has been set back by the snow here in the city, and hasn't gotten 
to look at her yet - and we're supposed to be leaving Saturday! Anyways, I was 
wondering if I could line up any help along the way, in case we do take her... 
Leaving NYC on Saturday, hoping to make St. Paul late Sunday - overnighting in 
Indiana somewhere. Any holiday-spirited VW geniuses out there willing to let 
me know where they are in case she just up and quits in the middle of nowhere? 
The route is:

St. Paul &lt;-
            \
		 \
		  \
		   - Chicago&lt;--&lt;zzz...&gt;---- Cleveland &lt;------ Brooklyn

Thanks a lot volks - and if you see a brick-red brick on route 80, wave, and 
pray to any god or gods you feel might be useful.

Hope you're having a good one,


Anton
