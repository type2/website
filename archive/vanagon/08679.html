    &gt;In the less politically correct days I used the top of the
    &gt;piston as an ashtray!

i keep, not as an ashtray but as a memento
to disaster recovery, the #3 piston from
my 64 bug clearly showing the place where
the valve went through it on its way into
crankcase.  a vw owner for all of 10 days
at that point (my first car!), i bought a
copy of the muir book, got out the washtubs
(parts containers) and the rest is history.
