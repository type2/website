&gt; Speaking of which, in general people I think exhibited an interest
&gt; in doing this every 8-12 weeks or so.  Does anyone want to nominate
&gt; a place and time for the next one?  A suggestion for the desert
&gt; was made, but I can't remember for which one, or how far away it
&gt; was.

Todd Schroeder mentioned the Twentynine Palms area.  That is on the
North side of Joshua Tree National Monument (soon to be a National Park!!).
There is at least one campground on that side of the park (I think it is
Indian Wells) that would do.  It's main claim to fame is boulders.  They
are everywhere!  Lots of boulder climbing to be done there.  There is also
a real nice oasis nearby that is an easy 4 mile hike from the road.
The only problem with Joshua Tree is that it is fairly far from the Bay
area, where most of the West-coast vanagon owners seem to be.  Another
nice place is Red Rock Canyon, which is farther North on highway 395.
It features a large campground and beautiful sandstone formations like
those in Bryce canyon (Utah).  It's kind of isolated though.  Either of
these places would be fine with me for the next pre-tour.  How does
late March sound?
