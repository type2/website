Subject:      Those hubcaps

Ok if the hubcaps every one is so hot for are those aluminium looking
six spoked(or so) things with the Wolfsburg emblem in the middle, I've
got a set I will trade for.  I'll consider the spare watercooled westi
that everyone else seems to have or a complete VR-6 motor installed in
my vanagon. Ok I just give them to the first poor soul who answers this
posting.  The time on the list is the winner, no private emails count.
