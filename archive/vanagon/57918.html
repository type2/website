I have been an avid reader of this list for past few months. Saw some recent
postings about T-shirts and coffee mugs for sale, so I thought it would not
be out of line for me to post this. 

If you read the most recent issue of GASS (German Air Sucker Society)
magazine, I am the guy who is doing a monogramed GASS logo hat and am
interested in doing club or event hats, shirts, etc.

I am very easy to deal with. There is no setup charge to groups (typically
$50 to $100) for your artwork. I can scan logos or work from your design
ideas. You can provide your own clothing item if you want. You will see me at
various VW and Porsche swap meets in Eastern US so stop by and say hello.

I am really a 356 Porsche guy but I crave a 76 to 85 Westfalia camper bus to
go to VW events in. I have had 3 VW campers over last 15 years with various
degrees of success. Wife and college-age son threaten bodily injury if I
bring another vehicle home. 

Does anyone out there want to talk about doing a sample hat for their local
club or for an upcoming event?
