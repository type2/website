Subject: Vanagons/Transporters in Blue, White, and Red

I see a lot of those French films, you know, how we say down South: Frey-inch.

Anyway, in the film &quot;Red&quot;, the last in the Tri-Colors series, a Vanagon is
shown in Switzerland used as a detection vehicle for illegal radio signals.
It seems that our hero in this film is listening to his neighbors portable
telephone conversations.  This particular Vanagon sounds like it has an
electric motor (or maybe it's just one that is powered by an in-line 4
cylinder Golf-type engine.  It sounds a lot different than my '85.

Are there electric motor Transporters in Europe?

Regards
