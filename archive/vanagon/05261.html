&gt; &gt;I installed custom reclining seats in Bobo but was afraid to remove the
&gt; 
&gt; Bobo? That's very cute. Kind of reminds me of Montgomery Burn's teddy bear
&gt; in one of the Simpsons' episode. So, where did you find those seats? Were
&gt; they expensive. I looked at some catalogs, but they were expensive, like
&gt; $250 each. Maybe I'll try to find myself those heated Volvo seats someone
&gt; else had mentioned a few weeks ago. (Saab probably has them too, and IF I
&gt; remember well, the recline is thiner than average and so the seat would fit
&gt; more easily.)
&gt; 

Well, part of the reason I don't care if my seats recline or not is that
I didn't pay much for them.  I bought them at a yard sale for $35 for
the pair.  They are out of a late-model Ford Mustang/Escort and were in
great shape except for the stock metal feet which I had to get rid of
anyway.  I had to do some creative adaptation to put them in, but
they're in and they work much, much better than the old ones.  They are
still not what I'd call a comfortable seat for long trips but they _are_
cloth and they aren't disintegrating into a pile of horsehair and rusty
springs! (sound familiar?)  :)  And the price was right!  If anybody is
remotely interested in the (extensive) details about how I got them to
fit let me know and I'll email them to you directly.
