&gt;so, if you don't hear from us for a day or so, expect that your server has
&gt;caused bounced messages back to the listserv, and you've been dropped.
&gt;normally, you just send your subscribe message to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
&gt;but i saw your message so i got the listserv to put you back on the list.

Many thanks to all you guys who answered my call for help.

I admit I was starting to have withdrawal symptoms (panic attacks, heart
palpitations, night sweats etc.)  when I did not get my daily dose of BUS
info after four days.  But all OK now, I'm getting vanagon mail again.

Thanks Again
