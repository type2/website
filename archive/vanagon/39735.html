Listen to Muir, install the flaps and thermostat.  Don't tempt fate.

&gt;Greetings all,
&gt;
&gt;After taking a two month break from work I am back and glad to have the list
&gt;to enjoy each day.
&gt;
&gt;Anywho, I am in the midst of a head job and while they are at the shop I
&gt;have been picking around at various components that I wouldn't normally be
&gt;able to get at without the engine being removed from the bus.  Last night I
&gt;noticed that the Thermostat has been removed from the engine and the flaps
&gt;for any air flow have just been left wide open.  Muir does not recommend
&gt;this, but with summer coming along, is it a good idea to not install the
&gt;Thermostat at all and leave the flaps open?  Anyone else have this sort of
&gt;set-up?
&gt;
&gt;Of course, this is an '83 Air-Cooled Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Bill Ernest
