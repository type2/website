On Fri, 02 May 1997 16:33:01 +0000 you said:
&gt;What kind of fire extinguisher do you recommend?

at least a 5lb one. i prefer carbon dioxide (over the chemical stuff ...
the chemical stuff leaves a purple goop all over whatever you spray it
on. and it's very difficult to get the goop off). i have a 10lb halon
in my bus, but they've outlawed halon now. the best thing to do, seriously,
is check with your fire department ... they LOVE to help you choose an
extinguisher. :)

&gt;Secondly, anybody have any words of wisdom on how to avoid a burning
&gt;bus (short of checking your fuel lines every time you drive).

just replace all the rubber hoses about every five to six years. and
make sure you LOOK under/around/at the bus every week or so ... that way,
you can spot little problems before they become big problems. leaks, drips,
tears, rust, etc. in order to solve/fix a problem, you first have to know
that a problem exists!

good luck.
joel
