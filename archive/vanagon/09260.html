Ok, so now I am definitely in the lead for the geek of the week award!

I went barreling into the shop today, bitchin about how the tranny didn't
work and how I though I needed a new one, blah blah blah.  The owner and
I discussed the problem, which he said was 'cause I mis-installed the
nosecone and probly the real axles, too.  Taking it person, I sez I
didn't.  He even got the gut who owns the shop that did the tranny on the
phone and I talked to him.  He came to the same conclusion.

Turns out they were right.  One of the shift forks was down on the tranny.
And the right axle was not inside the fulcrum plates, but on top, which
might also explain why it leaked so bad.  

I started working on it at 6:00 tonight, and by 9:30 I had the engine and
tranny out, the nose cone fixed, and the axle fixed, awaiting cleanup and
reassembly.   I took the opportunity while everything was out of the car
to spray some more paint above where the tranny goes, and do some cleanup
and painting of the frame rails.  Its starting to look spiffy under there!

So tomorrow I go, hat in hand, foot in mouth, to buy this shop-dude a beer
or whatever.  Hopefully I'll have the whole mess put back together by tomorrow
night!
