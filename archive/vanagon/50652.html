&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Just replaced the front speakers.  I found out a couple of things that
&gt; didn't seem to get mentioned before.
&gt; 
&gt; First, if you got the molded plastic type stock blauplunk, the speaker
&gt; screws out.  On the inside of the panel there is a collar that acts like
&gt; a big nut to hold the speaker against the panel.  Second, The speaker is
&gt; glued to the molded plastic grill. It ain't worth even trying to reuse
&gt; the original grill.

     Hey Hotch,
        What speakers did you use? Did the grill fit with out interfering
        with the window crank?
