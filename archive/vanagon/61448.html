Subject: A has-been no longer!

I've stood on the sidelines and watched, while the California Camping
Crazies 
have been gamboling all over the place with their campers. Well...NO
MORE! 

Having been camperless since '93 when I sold both our '85 GL Weekender
and &quot;Flora&quot; the 
'85 Westfalia to buy my wife a '91('90 in Calif.) Vanagon Carat, I'm
happy to announce 
that I'm returning to Westfalia ownership with a '91model year
(manufacture dates 10/90 at VW, 11/90 at Westfalia, first sold in 91)
non-syncro, white Westfalia with everything including automatic
tranmission as soon as the deal is concluded. The AC works wonderfully,
the camper systems are in good operating condition, cosmetically the van
is flawless inside and out (including the front facia due to being
covered with a &lt;choke&gt; bra! Said bras - there are two that come with it
- will be available to trade to listmembers.) A Catalina 2500 awning is
attached and appears almost new...unfortunately the front plastic pole
&quot;clip&quot; srewed to the body behind the right front wheel is broken! Anyone
know if these are available as replacement parts from CampingWorld?

The heads have been done &quot;recently&quot; as has the water pump and
brakes...no apparent 
fluid leaks and the interior of the engine compartment is CLEAN. All the
belts were recently replaced. 

It even comes with all 5 alloys...one of which (the spare) has a well
used Michelin 
MXL (or variant, from the tread design)...unfortunately the PO (actually
his brother
the previous PO) shod the van with some 205/70 14s which are underrated,
passenger car 
tires with too soft sidewalls! These will be changed out immediately on
possession for some capable rubber. I guess I'll search the archives for
the latest in the on-going
tire discussion... or just go out and get the correct Michelins.

Front table and post apparently are available from previous-PO. 

I thought they all came with the second battery by '90/91, but
appranently that's 
not true...another trip to the archives to fix this oversight.
Personally, I don't 
see how anyone can do without an auxiliary CAMPING battery. I like to be
able to 
count on the vehicle battery for engine starting, regardless of the
length of stay 
or use of coach accessories and lights.

It has a hitch with ball on tongue which is bolted to the tow loops as
well
as to a frame member directly behind the center of the bumper...is this
how the 
typical towloop hitch is attached, or this arrangement at bit stronger?

It'll be interesting to see how I'll solve the need for additional
seating...whether
installing the seat rails for a center single swiveling captain's seat
(since I have 
one of these from Flora) or a center bench from a mid 80s Weekender, or
finding
and installing the hardware for a Carat/Multivan backward facing theatre
seat is 
the answer. Suggestions/discussion please!

BTW: I have two brown center bench seats (one that has been expeosed to
the elements, 
     and one that has been garaged since new in '88)...I'll entertain
any reasonable
     offers. Wife says they have to go...or go to the dump.
