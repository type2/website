Subject: RE: Mexican VW report


&gt;Bay-window buses everywhere, used as collectivos in the smaller towns--
&gt;and in Puebla, too.  They appear to be the same as the last ones
&gt;in the US ('78 or so) except for the water-cooled engine and the
&gt;ugly black radiator on the front.


What kind of watercooled engine? A flat-four wasserboxer style?
Or an inline 4 like a rabbit/jetta?   ...???
