Subject: Junkyard Dogs.   grrrrrr!

all this talk about VISA surcharges...

the local junkyard has a usual and customary practice of quoting the 
'sucker' price on the phone and when you get there to pick up the 
part the price is ALWAYS higher.  'had a hard time getting it out.  
broke a tool getting it out.  took more time than we planned getting 
it out.' or my favorite... 'too damn cold out there, help us out'

they have you by the short ones.  either you walk away and don't take 
the part or you haggle, cuss, and threaten and still walk away paying 
more than they said it would be before you drove down to the yard.

so, this yard that tacked on the VISA surcharge is just being more 
&quot;90s&quot; in their shenannigans than some of the others.

there is a yard down in Brainerd that IS well run.  all parts are
inventoried on computer and for the most part, stripped off and
stored with a control number. their price quote holds.   very
professional staff.  clean and polite to women.  but they don't have
Vanagons  :(
