Hi All,

I ran across a great deal for somebody.  An original owner 86 Syncro GL, 5
speed, 127k, light chocolate brown. The CV's were recently repacked,
recent tires, new side pipe. Looks nice, still shiney.  It's about 2 miles 
from my house.  The guy needs to sell it soon.

Bad points:  Needs head gaskets, front pipe, rf stabilizer, AC is not
charged, main heater lever broken, no rear lockout, slight 'graze' dent on
sliding door, steering rack has a small leak, and some seam and window
sill rust. Although is is a bit of a list of problems, it is drivable, you'd 
just have to keep on eye in the coolant etc., IMHO. I'd buy it myself if I
could swing it, but with 15 other VW's and a not-so-enthusiastic spouse,
it is just not feasible for me to get it!  8-/  email me for further
details, first come, first serve...  (oh yeah, no alloy wheels)
