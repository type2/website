&gt;&lt;&lt; How can I get the old pipes off, with the bolts, in order to simple
&gt; reinstall the same pipes?  Must I replace solid pipes just because I can't
&gt; get a rusted bot removed from it?
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;A lucky mechanice armed aith a torch, cut0off wheel, and chisels should be
&gt;able to separate the parts with little damage.  It takes practice.  I even
&gt;practice removing pipes that are to be thrown away.

I got my pipes apart with a dremel tool (cutting disk), chisel and hacksaw.
NOT WHERE THEY ATTACH TO THE HEADS.
Fun job.
Good luck.
