Subject: Temp. Sensor II Placement Question
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 96 11:12:00 PDT


Greetings all,

Glad to hear some of you liked that kooky bus sighting story, most of my 
non-VW friends just look at me funny when I tell them about it (now you can 
only guess that doesn't happen very often!)  I will try and steal the 
digital camera from work and take pictures.

OK, while reassembling and installing my engine (2.0 L, '83 Westy), I 
notices only one mistake (knock on wood).  I put the Temperature Sensor II 
in the wrong place (by cyl #4 instead of #3).  Now I know that # 3 is the 
hottest one so not having the RTD on that particular cylinder is probably 
not a good idea, but can i wire it across the engine to its electrical 
recepitical?  Or should I bite the bullet, spend some more clams and get 
another sensor and install it in the right place? (I think I just answered 
my own question).

P.S. How about some more specific info on where the PNW 4/27 camping will 
be.  All previous posts have not cleared up my question where is it going to 
be (in general terms for general minds).  Thanks
