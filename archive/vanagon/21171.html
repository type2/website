Subject: re:'90 brake probs fixed

&gt;One other thing - while test driving and test braking I noticed that a
&gt;rapid series of hard pumps on the brakes seems to disable the front disks.
&gt;Hard stabs at the pedal about a second apart gives seriously degraded
&gt;stopping on the third shot.  Lots more pedal pressure required as well.  Is
&gt;this fade? (shouldn't have had time to get hot, and if I ran for a few more
&gt;seconds and then hit the brakes once hard, the front brakes work fine)
&gt;What could be making the front brakes quit working?

The brake pedal needs to return completely to the stop for the master cylinder
to recharge, for lack of a better term, what I would assume is that either
the pedal is not returning completely, or the plunger(i guess) that forced the
brake fluid into the lines, and forces the calipers to grap is not being
retracted completely. I will probably be flamed for this, but try some
lubricating oil on that part(if accessible) to loosen it up.

just my 12 won(Korean)

Hi All -

  Our garage has a vintage Genie door opener which performed quite
  well until recently.  It started opening and closing of its own
  accord.  Our neighbors said that it might be picking up someone
  else's signal but this was happening late at night when the
  street was empty.  Also, it would open and close several times
  in succession.  We ended up unplugging it most of the time but when
  it is plugged in, it opens or closes almost immediately all on its
  own.  Has any of you has this kind of experience?  If so, what was
  the prognosis?

Thanks - Sue
