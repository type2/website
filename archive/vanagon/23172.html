Subject: Re: bungee cord question, pointless BBTA story


&gt;How long does a tranny usually last when you start with the bungees?
&gt;The one on my `66 just completely lost fourth, after only 200 miles
&gt;or so of a bungee.

A friend of mine, Tim, has a 63 crew cab.  From the day he bought 
it (make that the day he got it running) it would pop out of 4th
when going up a steep grade.  Well, he used the bungee for over
2 YEARS with little problem.

Last fall, three of us were going to BBTA in two crew cabs.  As we
were crossing the mountains in NW Tennessee he totally lost 4th.
Nothing.  Nada.  So we limped into a truckstop at the top of the 
mountain, made arrangements to keep it there over the weekend, and
he piled in with Allen &amp; I, and we continued on to BBTA.

(You never leave a man behind! - Raising Arizona)

On the way back, after stopping for riverboat gambling, Allen's
crew cab started making a light rapping.  We stopped and checked the 
valves which seemed to be in reasonable adjustment (not recommended 
on a warm engine!).

We continued on to TN where Tim's truck was parked.  By the time we 
got there, the light rapping had turned into a very noticeable
knock.  We decided that it sounded like the wrist pin in #4.  We
knew that engine was not long for this world, but decided what the
hell...  let's see how close to home we can get before she blows.

Since Tim couldn't go over 40 in 3rd and our engine might blow at
any minute, we decided the interstate was out of the question and
took back roads to limp home.  Well it added 5-1/2 hours to our trip,
but we all made it home alive.

Tim was tight on cash and bought a used tranny for $100.  Two months
later it started popping out of fourth.  Bungee lasted about another
month.  He ended up getting a friend of ours to build another tranny
for him using a 70 beetle tranny and his reduction boxes.  Tim has 
been very pleased with his present setup as the final drive is taller 
and he can really cruise on the highway.

Allen tore down his engine, and sure enough, the #4 rod had elongated
into an egg shape at the piston wrist pin.  Another 100 miles probably
would have sent the rod through the case.

What's my point?  I don't know...  I forgot what we were talking
about...  Oh yeah, go ahead and pay for a rebuilt instead of taking
a chance on a used one if you don't know it's history.

Hope to see everyone at BBTA in a couple of weeks.

Dave
