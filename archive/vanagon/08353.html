I feel that I deserve a new catagory.  Nothern California is Redding North!
Jsut ask anyone who lives in Northern CA.  Call it CA.NN if you like. But
I think California is big enough to have more then just North and South.
Heck Siskiyou County (in which McCloud is the Gem) has to be as large or
larger then PA.C.  How about giving me my geographic due.

How's this:

CA.NN = Logville
CA.C  = Fogville
CA.S  = Smogville
