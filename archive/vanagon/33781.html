&gt; &quot;You'll know instantly when someone's coming in your driveway, without
&gt; risking your safety or interrupting your activities.

&gt; Transmits up to 200 feet away.

&gt; My only concern about both of these systems is that cats and such may
&gt; set them off.
 
As an alternative, for the truly paranoid, I suggest peafowl. Will holler 
like the living dead at the slightest foreign motion, and look prettier 
than dogs. No wiring. They eat pesky bugs. And several of you have handy 
yard cars that would serve well as coops.
