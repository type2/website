Subject: 	halogen backup lights


I tinted my van widows with limo (darkest available) tint and now the=20
reverse lights are nearly ineffective without intent concentration.  =
Does=20
anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets neet =
to be=20
changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if necessary) be =
had?

Thanks,
Fred

Hey Fred,

I too, have my '74 tinted with limo tint.  I gave on the brighter light =
solution and just stick my head out the window and look back, or have my =
wife look for me. May not be the best solution, but it works.
