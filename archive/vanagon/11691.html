Subject: Factory Tools List Vanagon

The purpose of this message is to give you a list of factory tools for late
model Vanagon repair. I have also added some comments about an auction I
where I bought factory tools. But the real purpose of this post is to give
you a convienient &quot;want list&quot; of which factory tools you would buy at a VW
swap meet or other place if you found them cheap.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

Last weekend I won the bidding on most of the special VW tools at the
auction of the VW dealer. I have quite a number of these tools in duplicate,
as well as other tools, so some of you will be in luck to share the bounty
with me. It will take me a long time to catalog all of what I bought. And
yes, I did buy huge piles of factory press tools &quot;by the pound,&quot; as they say.

As a curiosity I made a list below of those factory tools which are used to
repair an 86+ vanagon syncro. The list is virtuallly identical to the list
of tools for a two wheel drive Vanagon. 

On the left is the tool number. After the comma is the price VW charges its
dealers for this tool when I bothered to put a price in. A retail outlet
like Baum would charge double these amounts. It seems that in order to have
a complete set of factory tools to fix your van you would spent about
$25,000. This figure doesn't include the cost of your lifts, wrachets,
testers, etc. Some tools have no price which just means I didn't put one in
yet. 

The list is not a list of tools that I bought. It is simply a list of all
the tools in the microfiche to repair a late model vanagon. I bet I now own
about a third of these tools. Most of the tools below are metal pieces.

I intend to sell at deep discount (like, 70 to 80% off) all the cool VW
cools that apply to other models of VW beside Vanagon--such as tools for
diesels, Dashers, Rabbits, Beetles, Busses, etc. This is a once in a zillion
year opportunity for you fanatics to get these tools cheap so you can e-mail
me your want lists. You need to look up the actual factory part numbers for
the tools you want, however. There is no need to e-mail me your want-list,
however, because I will probably get around to posting  a list of what I got
next summer or fall--that is, those tools I have not sold off by then. 

In a great many cases, it is not neccessary to have these tools but they
save a lot of time and anguish. Also, it happens that you have things half
apart in your driveway to find out what factory tools you need and which you
don't.
