&gt; i checked out the paulchen rack system.  man is that thing _expensive_!!
&gt; there is no way i can afford a $350+ rack.
&gt; 
&gt; i made my own for my breadloaf.  it holds 3 bikes by their forks,
&gt; handlebars up on the rear of the van.  they can be swung aside for
&gt; engine work, and the total cost of the materials was about $10 (though
&gt; it did require some welding and drilling).  i am very pleased with it.
&gt; the bikes are very secure, and the rack is all but invisible (really!)
&gt; when the bikes are not there.
&gt; 
&gt; if anyone is interested i will post a more detailed description.
