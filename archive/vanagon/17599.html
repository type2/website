Subject: Best bus for Mexico (was Some 1600cc questions.)

Thanks for the comments. I guess my intent is to put together the best 
bus for Mexico/Central America travel:

I took my '76 Camper down there several years ago and I would of really 
been deep in caca if I had needed any engine parts.

However, parts for 1600cc powered buses can be found worldwide.... 

Of course, a '71 Bus would be a mechanic's dream, but, alas, I've been 
spoiled by the royal comforts of my '77 camper... What to do ???

&gt; HI ALL,		
&gt;  Morris, I have the last 'bug engine' bus from '71.  I think by then the
&gt; size of the bus had grown too big for the engine.  It is really sweet,
&gt; though, 'cause the engine slips out like a dream...but lacks power.  
&gt;   I am quite sure that if you put the upright 1600 into a later bus you	
&gt; will find that the power is not sufficient to pass anything going more
&gt; than 55 mph.   You could rebuild a 1600 into a larger displacement version,
&gt; but I have heard that there are cooling issues related to the load there.
&gt; With the bus in particular,  air flow is CRITICAL, and just adequate, so
&gt; don't over-do it unless air/oil flow is also modified.  (IMOH)		   
&gt;   
&gt; KEEP IT COOL!,
&gt;  
&gt;  Chris '71 Camper (OTTO) and assorted bugs.

&gt; &gt; My real question:
&gt; &gt; I'd be really interested to know if anyone has put a Bug engine into a 
&gt; &gt; '76-'79 Bus. Or alternatively, '76-'79 Westfalia camper components on a 
&gt; &gt; '68-'71  Bus.
