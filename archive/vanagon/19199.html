I've driven vw buses since I was a teenager.  Only time I got searched 
for drugs was when I was tooling down Rt29 in Virginia in my Chrysler 
Conquest.  But then I have hair well past my shoulders a beard and dress 
generally like a non-reformed hippie (standard computer geek attire :) )

Maybe if you're worried about a previous owner you should do as 
thorough a search as you can.  Doubt you find anything though.

Usually (but not always) cops don't bother to stop anybody who is just 
driving.  If you don't attract attention to yourself I wouldn't sweat 
it.  Without 'hippie' stickers or paint job.  Without 'bad' driving the 
cops will leave you for other more likely prospects.  You will have more 
trouble in a college town from local cops who are likely to resent 
college kids - but this mostly applies to small towns.
