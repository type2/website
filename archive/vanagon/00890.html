&lt; much reasonable stuff deleted &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO - No matter what, the air-cooled variety of VW van never be made as
&gt; quiet as your standard, American-made, conversion van.  One can do things to 
&gt; limit the amount of noise in the passenger compartment, but a certain level
&gt; of noise must be tolerated. 
                   ^^^^^^^^^
Tolerated?  Nay, I say enjoyed!  Isn't that one of the main reasons we drive
these things?  Maybe I'm too much into the personality-of-the-vehicle thing, 
but I can still hear rumblings (though muted) of my '66 bus in my '85 Vanagon.
After I unload the kids in the morning and head towards work, I TURN OFF THE
RADIO (even though this is my main contact with the 'real world') and just
listen to that sweet sound as I sweep through the gears...  I also love 
bicycling, and I advocate the goals being espoused during this National
Bike to Work Week, but I'm still conflicted 'cause I love my VW!  

('scuse me... I'm getting a bit teary here...  think I'll go check out
the ads and see if anybody's selling one of those beautiful air-cooled
babies... I don't care if I freeze in the winter, it's spring NOW!)
