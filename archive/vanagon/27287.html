Subject: VWs on &quot;COPS&quot;/Hmmm...

I was &quot;riding along&quot; with the COPS program over the weekend. One episode
showed a police officer responding as backup/traffic control to a reported
fire. The camera showed great volumes of smoke rising from behind some tall
trees. As the camera was able to focus down the driveway, a red bay window
could be seen fully engulfed in flames. The bayburner was also still under
the garage! The camera shifts to a scraggy looking &quot;brother wrencher&quot; in
greasy overalls in shear shock. This dude was *WAY* bummed! Seems that it
wasn't his bus or his barn/garage. The police and medical personnel had all
they could do to calm him down.
The explaination that he gave was that he was tracking down a fuel leak. He
went inside to use the telephone and spaced out as to where he was in the
sequence of the R&amp;R. He jumped into the bus and cranked the key &quot;to clear
some fuel that was in the cylinders&quot; and the whole thing went up. (DUH?) As
he pounded his fists into his legs he lamented, &quot;I forgot to disconnect the
coil wire.&quot;  *huh?* (pound, pound, pound...)
The poor fella looked totally physically and emotionally worn out. It was
another good image builder for the home VW mechanic crowd. How come we don't
ever see '31 Auburn Boattails/'59 gullwinged Mercedes/'53 Vettes littering
California's lovely Highway 5 or burning from the engine compartment on TV?
Things that make you go Hmmm...

BTW: Going to see King Crimson at the Phoenix symphony hall tonight. The
youngish C.E. down the hall that follows all of the mosh pit speed metal
stuff just deadpanned at me when I told him of my plans. &quot;Who's he?&quot;, the
kid asked. (I'm a fossil, I know it). More things that make you go Hmmm...
