Subject:      fuel tank leak...

Filled up the '91 on the way home today.
Drove the 2.1 miles to home and parked in the driveway.
Our driveway is almost sloped enough to bleed the coolant system without
further jacking.
Smell gas.
Look underneath.
Steady drip coming from center of the gas tank (not a stream, but a rapid drip)
Turned the car around in the driveway so that the front was lower than the
rear.
No more leak.

What's on the top rear of the gas tank to leak like that?
I'm hoping there's a tired hose and it's not the tank itself...

Any hints?
Is this something I might be able to fix myself over the three-day weekend
(if it's not a leaky tank) or should I just bite the bullet and take it to
the dealer tomorrow?

(I get the digest version (usually late at night) so private responses
would be appreciated.)
