        There was an article on both the ad and the decision to run the add
in ether monday's or tuesday's Wall Street Journel, I think that it was in
the C section.  It has been th only index page listing of VW all week, so it
should not be that hard to find if anyone is looking for it.
        I did not see the ad, as I do not watch or, for that matter, own a
TV set.
