&gt;Somebody should really check these people out, they beat the pants 
&gt;off AVP or Stephens, can you say $1099 for the A/C vanagon 2.0 with 
&gt;NEW heads, P/C, lifters, bearings, etc.  Or can you say $750 with 
&gt;rebuilt heads with strengthened seats!!!  Or $1600 for a wasserboxer 
&gt;again with NEW heads.  Seems incredible to me, probably too good to 
&gt;be true, would be nice for one of our CA people near Santa Ana to go 
&gt;on by and give it a look-see.  Anyway just noticed it, maybe I'll buy 
&gt;some internals from them for the '78.

I had my 85 Westy waterboxer rebuilt at 101,600 miles by Fast German Auto.
They did a great job at a very competitive price!  Prior to deciding on them
as the ones to do the job, I asked a lot of questions, for which they had
informed and experienced answers.  I have recommended them to others who
have had similar results...

One neat little trick they did was to install a 3 series BMW thermostat
which runs the wasserboxer at a lower temperature.  In addition, they were
very good at laying out the options for any additional work I wanted done at
the time...

Take care...Bob Marshburn
