Subject: Stuff for sale

Greetings-

        I have been lurking for about two weeks and since I haven't seen
anyone flamed for trying to sell parts I have a couple of items that I never
used on a project a couple of years ago that I need to get rid of.          

        Pop top seal for 68-73 Westfalia it is a WCM and sells new for
ca.$75 I'll take         $50 it is new in bag

        Seat covers for 71 Bus with 1/3-2/3 front seat, black, made by TMI,
new price is         89.95 I'll take $50, also brand new.

If you are interested email me privately at hthomp19_at_mail.icon_dot_net.

TIA

Harry Thompson
