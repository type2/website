Subject: Gas tank leaks

There seems to be an unusually large number of people who are
reporting gas tank leaks, myself included. From what I can tell it seems that
the problem is a design defect - not a consumer defect. Has anyone ever
called the
NTSA hotline (1-888-DASH-2-DOT) To see if they would be interested in
investigating
the problem as a candidate for a recall?

Seems like a legitimate concern to me.
