Subject: Re: this is a bust

You are correct about the break light on the trans.  Space is a wonderful
place
  There is a wiring problem with the break lights(sometimes they works
sometimes they don't).  But there is no break light switch in the trans.
 There a two wire that lead to just about were a plug is that should be the
switch.  I found out were this switch  by looking in my bently book. I have a
switch to put in but have been busy and hesitant about removeing this plug as
i would have to deal with trans fluid.  Yech!!  
At this point I can do nothing as the trans a body is in dead storage and my
bus time is being put into the engine.

Thanks for the note.
