&gt;Joel mentions a Berg contraption that -if I understood correctly- makes
&gt;shifting from 2nd to 3rd a bit easier or faster. Is that for vanagons
&gt;only or would it also work on a bread-loaf?

the only one i ever got was for the vanagon ... and i don't know for sure
if he makes one for the bus. the same idea ought to work (i think): it just
raises up the pivot point for the shift lever.  but there might be some
design differences between the vanagon and bus shift levers that make the
bus lever need some slightly different version.

for me, it has definitely been worth the $20 ... but i do caution you:
FOLLOW the directions!! that is, when it says to mark with a pencil around
the washers/bolts, DO IT! :)  you can get it to work without doing this,
but it was a whole lot easier the first two times (when i did follow the
directions). the last time, i got pretty cocky and just 'did it' ... and it
took me about two weeks of fiddling and adjusting to get the lever back to
where it felt 'comfortable' ... i.e., didn't bind or grind.

a word to the wise. ;)
