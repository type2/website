Subject: Re:  Rear Bench Seat



&gt;&gt; Since we are on the subject of bench seats my '65 bus's
&gt;&gt; rear bench seat is in 2 pieces. The back cushion is detached
&gt;&gt; from the seating cushion. Seems to me they should be attached!
&gt;&gt; (My middle seat is in one piece)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Should the rear seat be one piece and, if so, how can I
&gt;&gt; attach these two separate cushions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Mine was separate in my '67, and actually in my '78 as well...


Ditto my '71's rearmost seat. I think they were all like this?
