You probably have a bad o2 sensor or you need a real bad tune up.  If you can
adjust the mixture as someone recommended, then you definitely have a bad
sensor.  I would definitely not replace the air flow meter or the injectors.
Find someone that knows what they are doing.  BTW, why do people call a
Vanagon Air Flow sensor a &quot;Mass Air Flow Sensor&quot;?  They are not the same
device.
