Subject:       Extractor &amp; Heat

I've got an extractor exhaust on my '71 (kadron) (I know, Bob, I 
know, but my stock muffler busted in two when one of the rubber engine 
mounts broke and dumped it (the engine) on the street, and the Kadron 
was free). 

What I want to know is if anyone has ever had any sucess hooking up 
heat pipes from the fan hosing to the exchangers with such a setup, 
and how you did it.  

Is the geometry similar enough that the small 
heat exchangers that went on the stock exhaust and facilitated the 
connection between the ducting and the HE's can be installed on the 
extractor?  Or will I learn to drive in the mummy bag?

Thanks!

Shaun
