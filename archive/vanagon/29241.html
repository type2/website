First, Ric &quot;Flat Ulence&quot; Golen popped off with:
&gt;&gt;You would be LUCKY to breathe in my flatuence....   ;-)

Then, Eddie Hintz (of the Hintz 57 fame), retorted:
&gt;        So does this mean that your flatulence is a joy that only the few
&gt;privileged can savor, such as expensive wine? Or that your flatulence is
&gt;the odor equivalent of Schafer Light beer in a can, making one fortunate to
&gt;survive exposure? Enquiring minds want to know...   ;-)

Schafer Light beer?? howz about old Falstaff, in a can, after sitting in the
trunk of a car for a week?? :)

besides, the flatulence of lawyers doth make paupers of us all ...
