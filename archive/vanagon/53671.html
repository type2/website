This thread reminds me off an article about  one of Herr Dr. Porsche's
war time engineering feats. He designed the running gear for the
transportation of  a 20 ton long range artillery cannon. An interview
with one of the pilots of this machine recounts how he had this beast
well over the speed limit on the steep twisty Alpine roads,and had fun!.
I imagine some of it's design carried over .
