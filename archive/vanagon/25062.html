Too bad you are not a tad bit closer.  I have this gem I am selling for 
$450.00

For Sale
~~~~~~~~
1966 VW MicroBus - Standard Bus with 6 rear windows, stock 1500cc engine, 
perfect Bus for restoration while driving it around town.

I try to drive it no more than twice a week (less than 10 miles/week).

I will start off with the weak points, you will quickly see that the good 
do indeed outweigh the weak points.

Weak points:

Needs cargo floor sections, rockers, and outriggers
Needs new front nose.. looks like Rusty VanBondo has been here ;-)
Carb might need to be rebuilt or just cleaned
Distributor isn't stock, PO replaced it with a 009
Cargo section interior is gone completely
Front seats need to be reupholstered

Strong points:

Looks great from the outside.. no holes, only surface rust around 
  windows, and the only bondo is on the above mentioned nose.
Engine is solid, last time I checked the compression was around 108 in 
  each cylider, and doesn't leak oil.
Engine compartment is in great condition.
Cab interior is great with the exception of the above mentioned seats, 
  everything works and is in remarkably good condition.
Original paint can be seen under the current Black/White scheme!
Just replaced the drag link arm and tightend up the steering.
Suspension is solid
Fairly new brakes and tires

General Info:

1966 Model 221 MicroBus
Original Colours: Tizianrot (L555 Titan Red) (Lower Half)
                  Beigegrau (L472 Beige Gray) (Upper Half)
Optional Accessories: M114 - Six Hinged Side Windows
                      M430 - Dual Circuit Brakes
                      M025 - Lap Belt Anchors

This Bus has such great potential and must be seen to be appreciated.  
Bus and I are currently located in Minnepolis.
