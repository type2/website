Subject: V6anagon: Get your kicks on Rte 66 /f

Bob Hufford has kindly allowed me to forward a message via his system:

Day 1 of V6anagon 66 tour:

Hi, all... 

Loaded up two BIG suitcases with parts, bits&amp;pieces, tools, and a few
clothes. Airlines allow 70# per bag, I'm pushing it pretty hard.
Step out, lock the door, pick up both cases, and *pow*... handle breaks
right off one suitcase. Hope this isn't an omen. Some fast work with
a spare belt, and I'm off. 

At San Diego Airport, notice the sky cap hefting the bags with a frown.
A large tip changes his expression remarkably, and the bags sail on thru with
no further problem. Carried the briefcase, which itself weighs 35# (heavy-
but-not-large tool carrier), told the lady at the X-ray station I had 
tools inside, would she like me to open it? She smiled, put it on the 
conveyor. I stepped thru, didnn't get beeped, and found two suspicious 
guards waiting with my briefcase. I smiled, expalained about the tools,
and opened it. They were confused, and especially curious about the 
ball-joint fork, which one guard was feelint the points on. I smiled, smiled,
and they finally let me go.

Later on the plane, I helped a stewardess with her bag, whic was somewhat
heavy too. Afterward, said &quot;here, try mine&quot;. was fun to see the look on 
her face when she took the little briefcase. Craftsman wrenches aren't
light.

Baggage didn't get lost in Denver, whose new terminal looks like a side
view of a meringue pie. Connected thru to Springfield, MO, stepped off
the plane wondering how I would recognize Bob Hufford (who had volunteered
to give me a ride)... then almost immediately saw a man with a tolerant
smile and a large VW emblem, from the front of a '62 bus he told me later.
Some languages are universal, I guess. We headed for his car (a VW, of
course), and set off into the great unknown to meet the newest member
of the family.

Stay tuned to this list for more exciting installments....
