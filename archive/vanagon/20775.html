Subject: Newbie on list. ('69 transporter)

Hi All,
        I've recently purchased a '69 transporter (VIN 229-235-069).  It had
no seats except the driver and passenger buckets.  It has a plywood box
constructed in the back that can be used as a bed and I added a short bench
(origin unknown but it's out of some vw van at a local vw wrecker) so now
it's a 4 passenger van.  It's got some rot under the windshield that has been
sloppily repaired but it looks like it can be salvaged it also has surface
rust and dents and nicks all over the place.  It's green with a white/rust
roof.  The previous owner told me that it has sway bars and gas Bilstein
shocks and it does handle a bit stiff.  It is however blown all over the road
quite easily.  The engine is 2 years old with a higher lobed cam than stock
(how much I don't know) and it seems to be quite well tuned except for a
minor idle problem that I haven't looked into yet.  The main engine problem
right now is that it leaks a LOT of oil.  It will leak a little while driving
as the rear of the bus got speckled with oil and soon the speckles merged
into a fine coating.  It dumps about a cup of oil when I stop and this seems
a bit odd to me.  I'm going to be getting the 'Idiots guide' as soon as I can
find it and probably the Haynes manual as I live just around the block from
the Haynes offices.  Any other advice is appreciated as I seem to have found
a new hobby.  I want to get a Thing as my next project. 

Cheers
Scott Beckstead
