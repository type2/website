One question.....

I drive 11/1979 VW vanagon, 37kw/ 50hp, aircooled, so called model'80.
The problem is a leak in the tank.
It is, you know placed between the frontwheels, right
behind the second strut. So mud drives here, hitchhike.
Finaly rust destroy the surface from outside to inside.
Not otherway, here rust is forced by condensed water I think.

My tank looks like moonsurface with small holes in on area.
New tank costes near 700 german marks (approx 500$).

Has anybody patched his tank?
Ever heard about CURIL ?


Own tip to kit your leaking-carburetor-axis:
Plug rubber-rings from an water-tap on each
side of the throttle-valve-axle. 
Costes about 1$.


P.S. I studied physics in Muenster Germany, my hometown
is Wiedenbrueck (now Rheda-Wiedenbrueck). There I lived
vis-a-vis WESTFALIA. From 1970 to 1982 I looked
onto the carpool, maybe I saw all your westfali's some time
ago, --- small world.
