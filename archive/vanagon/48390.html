Subject: Additives for emmission reduction
Date: Fri, 16 Aug 1996 03:24:11 -0400 (EDT)

I have been offered an additive that is guaranteed to reduce the
hydrocarbons at the exhaust to pass the state emmission inspection.
Cost is $19.00 for 16 oz. Does anybody have any experience with this
kind of product and does it actually work. I heard some oil companies
in Canada actually adds this to the gasoline for emmission reduction.
I wont be due for inspection for at least 6 months so will not be able to
test its effectiveness. Perhaps some chemist or chemical engineer can
shed some light on this additive. Read somewhere also that such additives
contain manganese, the active ingredient. If anyone wants to buy this and
try out please let me know.  The supplier told me that it will not harm
the engine at all.
Its a two part solution that is mixed prior to adding to the gasoline.
