Subject:      The VW toilet

Hello;  In the early 80's we decided to take our 69 van, and the rest of our
family(1 girl 2 boys, and a 8 month baby boy) down to Disney land for a
summer vacation.  The kids partitioned off their own territories in the
back, and things went swimmingly.  By about the third day it occured to me
that the two boys hadn't been pestering me to stop at any bathrooms for the
entire trip, unusual for them, so I asked them about it.&quot;Oh no problem Dad,
we're just using the toilet in the back here&quot;.  Show me, says I.  Here it is
says Jeff, pointing to the little oval cover over the heater duct in about
the middle of the floor, which would be covered by the middle seat if I
hadn't taken it out for the trip.  Okay says me, but this toilet is only for
emergency use, and not for everyday use, tell me and we'll stop and find you
a toilet if you need one.  My wife and I still laugh about this.  Now that
the kids are grown, I found out that they had been using it for almost 2
years, and had a technique of kneeling with their back to the driver, and
slways closing the cover to keep the smell away.  They figured all VW vans
had the toilet built in.                          Larry Carter
