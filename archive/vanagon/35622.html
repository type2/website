Subject: Re: Crashworthiness of Bug Vans 

&gt; &gt; One last comment.  I was sitting in the drivers seat and looked ahead.
&gt;&gt; There is not much between you and anything you might hit besides the
&gt;&gt; steering column!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Kind of looked like point of impact to me.  I used an aircraft harness to
&gt;&gt;make myself feel more secure and kept meaning to put one of those spare
&gt;&gt;tire mounts on the front thinking it would be kind of be like a bigger
&gt;&gt;bumper.  You are up a little bit at least.

&gt;&gt;Re: Attention Bus Volks: part ??
&gt;
&gt;I've often wondered about crash worthiness of  my van.
&gt;I also wondered if 20 year old seat belts are any stronger than wet
&gt;lazagna noodles.
&gt;
&gt;I've rationalized it this way:
&gt;
&gt;1. I weigh more.
&gt;2. I'm higher, so won't hit any solid parts of little cars.
&gt;3. I've got a massive frame, bumper, etc.
&gt;Therefore I'll use up the other guys crumple zones, hence I don't
&gt;need any of my own.
&gt;
&gt;Weighed against:
&gt;
&gt;1. Seat belts are old, and could break.
&gt;2. If seatbelts don't break, I'm directly connected to the friggin' frame!
&gt;3. I start the whole process out about 6 inches from the accident instead
&gt;   of 4-5 feet that I would in my car.
&gt;4. No shock mmounted seat belts
&gt;5. No air bag.
&gt;
&gt;Conclusion: Unless I hit a Miata, I'm toast! 
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have other opinions, or data?

   Here's an ominous note.  I recently bought my 1986 Vanagon from an
emergency room nurse.  Now that sounds positive - she wouldn't own one
if they're deathtraps or mobile leg removers.  Except here's the reason
she sold it:  She didn't want her kids (sons) driving it now that they're
of driving age.  She bought them a Volvo.

   I've driven busses (now a vanagon) for maybe 150k miles over the 
last twenty years.  I drive much more defensively than most drivers,
especially where the front end is concerned:
   1)  Leave extra car-lengths between you and the car in front.
   2)  *NEVER* anticpate the car in front of you zooming through a
        yellow signal.  I did that once, and luckily had an empty lane.
   3) Use the height of your driving position to look down the road as
        far as possible and anticipate slow-downs or slow mergers.
   4) Stay awake.  The upright position of bus seats actually promotes
       good spinal position for blood-flow.  The bouncing helps to keep
       things moving.  If you get sleepy, open a window or go take a nap
       in the back.  This way you won't hit a pole with your face.
   5) Keep your brakes (and tires) in good working order.
   6) Leave yourself an escape lane or area.  This often means driving
       in either the fast or slow lane on freeways where there's a shoulder.

The insurance and law enforcement agencies assume that whoever
hit with the front of their vehicle is at fault.  So, if you follow the above
rules, it's pretty unlikely that somebody will back into you going fast
enough to do much damage.
