&gt; I'm looking for someone to say &quot;I've got a 009 on my bus, and it's been
&gt; fine for X years =)

How about this:

	&quot; I had an 009 on my bus for several years, and never *could* get
it to run right.&quot;

I'm sure there is a source out there for a stock replacement distributor.
Find it, buy it, and be happy.  :)  If nowhere else, call Vee Parts here
in San Diego at (619) 477-4787.  They should be able to help.  I would
recommend avoiding the 009.
