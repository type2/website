Subject: Manassas Bug-Out 38 meeting place
Date: Fri, 23 May 1997 09:24:43 -0400

After the discovery that Ron will not attend, there's been a proposal or
two on meeting places, but no confirmations. Its clear that several
folks from both lists will be there. 

Before we run out of time, I'll unilaterally declare my Silver Syncro
Westie as the meeting place. We are going to enter it in the show, so
just look for us wherever the buses are lined up. I'll be wearing my
black Type2_dot_com  T-shirt.  

One listmember has to leave around noon and so I'll follow up on his
proposal and suggest we meet at 11:30. If you arrive after that, come on
by anyway, you'll be welcome any time.

Tom F.
