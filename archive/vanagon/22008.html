&gt;Hey now,
&gt;        I've got this funky clanking-clunking noise coming from the
&gt;back. It only happens when the car is in motion, so it's not the
&gt;engine. Seems like it gets noisier at around 30-40 mph and also when
&gt;applying brake power. My first thought was the tranny, but the noise
&gt;happens while braking with the bus in neutral. I checked the
&gt;differential as per Muir, it's within 1-2&quot; like he says.

&gt;        Anyone have any ideas? I can't think of anything back there that
&gt;would make this sort of noise other than the tranny. Tranny mounts
&gt;maybe? Please email me, I get the digest. Thanks for your help.
&gt;
&gt;Peace,

Sounds like your trash can is falling off.   Happens to me all the time.  
Check the four wood screws that hold it into the frame.

Dave
