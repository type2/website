         Tim,
         I was able to repair mine. The electrical connection
         on the outside was corroded. I had to dig into the 
         plastic to get to the contact, cleaned it, then soldered
         a new wire to it. The cost is almost $0, just hard work.
        
         If you do replace your unit Let me know what you find 
         out. I someday may have to replace mine.
