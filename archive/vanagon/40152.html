Howdy volks,

Maybe you remeber my holiday plans, we (3 students) want to buy an old VW
bus, fix it up a bit and cruise europe with it.
Well we went to see a bus today.
It's a 1972 type II with an 1800cc type IV engine. It's a bit rusty, but
the front wheelwels and the floor have already been replaced. It's one of
those &quot;I'll finish it someday&quot; projects.

It has a lot of smal spots of surface rust. The rear bottom inch or so and
the bodywork around the slidingmechanism (where the rain water gets trapped
between the pannels). The is also a dent in the sliding door and some sod has
mounted a roofrack by screwing it into the roof ?!? The roofrack is now 
starting to rust a bit, so the whole thing has to come off to stop it from
affecting the roof.

The motor was revised 2 years ago (the bus has been stored since then) so
it should be ok. the only main thing is the movement in the shifter.
The owner said the rubber/plastic bushings are worn. What do you think ?????

They want about us$ 650 for it. what do you think of that ??
How much would those rubbers that prevent bottoming out, cost ?? 
They need to be replaced.
