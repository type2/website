So karen brown says:
&gt; 
&gt; I recently purchased an '84 Westy and am sorting things out.  The Dometic
&gt; fridge works fine on electric.  I tried it on gas for the first time last
&gt; week-end and it lit right up.  However, a few minutes later a very acrid
&gt; burning smell was emitted.  Could see no smoke so I watched carefully for a
&gt; couple of hours.  The smell remained strong but the fridge got cold.  I blew
&gt; out all vents with compressed air in case of debris but found none.  At one
&gt; point, it sounded like a small cooling fan came on but it went back off and
&gt; I never heard it again.  My father and fellow VW fan is ready to yank the
&gt; whole unit out which I would very much like to avoid.  Does anyone have any
&gt; advice??

Hi Karen,

I strongly suggest that you do remove the fridge.  It is not hard to do, just
a little awkward, but not too bad.  I did it recently and intended to clean
up in the compartment in back.  As it turned out, it was only dusty.  I would
presume that yours may have something in the fins that might be getting
hot (hopefully not wiring).  Or there might be something getting hot just
sitting next to the fridge.  But get behind there and have a look.  Well
worth the effort IMO.
