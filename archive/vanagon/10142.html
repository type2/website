Subject: IMPORTING A BRAZILIAN BUS-?

 i was recently informed by someone i do not know that when importing a car
 into the us it must meet us safety standards for its manufacture year. is
 this true.  if so would customs inspect a brazilian bus as a 1995 or a a 1975
 (if those are the specs they are made to).
