&gt;A: Yeah, but first you need go check your collection of several old bulbs
&gt;in the back yard. One for the filament, one with a good base, Genuine glass
&gt;from another... Maybe schedule a trip to Bulb-O-Rama if the parts arent all
&gt;present.


Hey, guess what... I just found out that a newer, larger bulb, made by
a completely different company, fits in the same socket as the original.
Has LOTS more power, too.    :^)
