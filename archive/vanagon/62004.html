Subject: 85 Vanagon performance enhancements

I am interested in performance enhancements for my 85 vanagon camper.  My
apologies in advance if this has been covered a thousand times on this
list server.  I read the archives for '97 but didn't find anything on this
specifically. 

Some people have told me the least expensive enhancement is to remove the
catalytic converter and replace it with a straight pipe.

Others have told me that there is virtually nothing else that can be done
-- it is what it is.

I have also been told that the Vanagon is not properly tuned for high
altitude (New Mexico is generally ~1 mile above sea level) unless it is
purchased w/high altitude parts.   I was told this high altitude pack
cannot be purchased any more.  My van was originally purchased in CA, so
it definitly does not have this feature.

comments, observations, etc. greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Ivan
