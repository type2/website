	Paul,
	You only need about a 4X4 foot area for you and space to
disassemble the joint, although a bench with a vise is handy for
dealing with circlips (Can't remember if that's an outer joint/steering
knuckle-only situation or not... do you have knuckle joints with a jesus
nut on the front axle, like a fwd water pumper VW?)
	If you were careful, you could do the work sitting inside the
vanagon. Good luck however it shakes out!

	Bill
