Hey all,
Since I didn't get a chance to post the classifieds on Sunday, I'll do it
today.  There are some very interesting (but stupid) spellings in this one
today!  Examples:

Vanegon Westphalia
Vannegan
Westvalia

Anyway, the below entries have been edited for correct spelling:

'91 Vanagon Westfalia camper, 65K miles, original owner, perfect condition,
$14,900, 703-524-6016

'86 Vanagon Syncro, 4WD, original owner, 120K, very clean, MD inspection,
$6000 obo, 410-822-9492.

'84 Vanagon GL, 7-passenger, 4-speed, a/c, am/fm/cassette, excellent
in/out, new tires, $2500 obo, 703-385-5903.

'84 Vanagon Westfalia camper, auto, power brakes (duh!), a/c, pop-top, 83k
miles, clean, excellent condition, $5500 obo, 703-533-0979.

'84 Vanagon Westfalia camper, fully equipped, 43K, great shape, great
present, $5500 obo, 703-237-2679.

garage kept, engine fully rebuilt at 98K, student owner, must sell, 110K,

other air-cooled VWs:

540-547-2223.

'71 Super Beetle convertible, red, 11K on new engine, very good condition,
$4000, 202-966-5251.

'69 Beetle, red, 1 owner, 98K miles, very good condition, clean, new
tires/battery, $4500 obo, 202-667-0677

'73 Super Beetle, completely restored by professional, all new, adult

540-752-1440 - Stafford VA.

'71 Beetle, new interior, stinger exhaust, custom lights, EMPI wheels,
great condition, 301-941-4230, leave message

That's all.  I'd stay away from that last '71 though.
