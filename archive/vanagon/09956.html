Subject: Engine Surges

While bleeding air from my cooling system, I ran the engine at about 2000 
RPM by putting a dime in the throttle linkage.  After it warmed up good, 
it started periods of running at 2100 and then dropping to 1900 and then 
back up again.  It would stay at one speed for a minute or more.

Later, it surged up to 3600 RPM, but I think maybe the dime moved and 
openned it up more so unless this sounds unusual to someone, I'll 
probably ignore it.

After bleeding the air, I drove the camper about 1/2 mile home.  It 
seemed really doggy, very little torque so that it required a downshift 
at rather earlier times than normal on a hill.

Any thoughts on all this?
