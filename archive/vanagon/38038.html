Subject: Re: Parcel Shelves WAS: Wood Westie Interiors (T2)


&gt;&gt;Forgive my split ignorance, is the parcel shelf the one under dash? I
&gt;&gt; saw something in the WCM catalog , part # 211-110 $125 for 68-79 that
&gt;&gt; was described as such. If they are that handy I may whip something up.

Why bother with trivialities like parcel shelves, that is the location
where you COOL VW or DPD AIR CONDITIONING UNIT is supposed
to go ladies and gentlemen, and you don't see them in your average
split.  (well there is a '66 Westy in a local junkyard with an under
dash
unit, but it is under the parcel shelf)

(Sorry had to take this jab, though I know someone will point out
that such a unit will tend to send a Type 4 motor straight to hell,
I love my big bay padded BROWN ('78 cocoa bus) dash and it has
146k on the origional, though tired, T4 and having just put a belt on
the DPD A/C it still works)
