Subject: email server weirdness

I appologize for some apparent weirdness going on with the email server that
I am hooked up through at work. I have been getting responses from threads
that took place months ago. List members have been getting mail that I sent
months ago. Similar scene elsewhere in my office. Please trash said items
unless related to free 23 window finds or NOS what-not spice rack cabinets ;-)
