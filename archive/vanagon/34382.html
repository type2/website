&gt;After 170,000 miles it is now time to replace the liquid puncher.  I 
&gt;have been quoted about $2350 for a factory 1.9 longblock.  It seems that 
&gt;installation can run up to $1200.  This seems sort of high for the 
&gt;installation labor.  (of course this is dealer labor rates.)  What is a 
&gt;reasonable cost for replacement??  Question #2:Can a 2.1 be substituted, 
&gt;or were there too many changes in '86.  Thanks for any input.

I would stronly recomend a 2.1.  If buying a long block, it is a direct fit
and your FI will support it. I've done this many times.  I would look to find
a good used one complete with the exhaust.  The cooling system in the Van can
be upgraded to the later style if you have all the pieces.  The later system
works better due to some flow improvements.  Less susceptible to air in the
syetm, easier to bleed.  E-mail me if you need any frther info.  I can also
help you get an engine.
