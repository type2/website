Subject: Re: bus accident

Saw a news last night about a VW bus involved in a fatal head on accident.
The bus appeared to be of 70's. The accident happened on a Bay Area highway
in California.

The left front corner (driver side) was severly ruined. The driver door was
missing (probably torn by rescue workers to get the driver out). However, 
the driver's cab of the bus seemed remain intact. The bus was still on its
wheels. Have no idea how badly the driver was injured. But by looking at the 
damage I believe the driver should be OK with moderate injuries only.

Not so lucky with the other car though. If not mistaken what I saw on my TV
was a small Japanese car. The car was torn into pieces. The front axle with
engine was seperated from the rest. The passenger cabinet was totally exposed
and fractured. It's unbelievable... There were 2 fatalities reported.

It was an awful accident. Don't know which car was responsible. One thing for
sure is that VW buses are safe besides the the special taste driving in them.
