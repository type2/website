Subject: Tired of Radio Shack

I am getting tired of high prices and limited selection of electronic 
parts.  Last week I needed some 18 ga grey wire.  Radio Shack does not 
have grey.  Does anyone know of a mail order source for wire, 
connectors, and other electronic parts?  

Thanks,

John Brown
