Hi.  I've never posted a van for sale before, and this one isn't mine.  But,
dang this is one clean Westie.  So here goes.

Found at West Side VW.  One 1989 Westie.  VERRY Clean.  I drove it a short way
down the road, and the only thing I found wrong was fuse #19 blown.  (Turn
Signals)  The van is a very sharp looking dark grey, with tinted windows all
around.

The Details:

1989 Westie, Automatic.
Only 80,000 miles!
I forgot to ask the price, sorry.
Color, a very nice looking grey
    w/ tinted windows all around.
Windows are sliders, with screens
NO RUST NOTED, not even in the seams.
Air Conditioning (in the middle)
Pop top works nicely, and no tears.
All the curtains are there.
Inside camper equipment looks VERY clean.
   Swivel seats up front, tables, it's all there.
No electric locks or windows (bummer)

The van is originally from Indiana.

Dang but that's one nice lookin van.  I really like the Burgundy/Dark Red ones
I've seen also, but I'd have to say this Grey looks even nicer.

For details, contact Bob Tousignant at West Side VW.  377-4100.  Tell him I
told you to call.  He's a good guy, and has sold me both of my new VW's, a
1978 Scirocco and a 1987 GTI 16V.

All the usual disclaimers apply:
o  I'm not with West Side, I only spend money there.
o  Your mileage may vary, and what turns your crank may not turn mine.
o  All the really nice van's should belong to listee's, the rest of the public
should live with what we don't want.

o and last but not least, for a really good time, contact Mark Larson at
612-502-0440 (or &lt;www.winternet_dot_com/~marble/tombstone&gt;)

Come join us for the 20th running of the Tombstone Trail, October 25, 1997.
We're running out of Rochester MN and Fillmore County this year.

&gt;From the north, take U.S. 52 to the southwest part of Rochester, MN.  Before
the 16th St SW exit, you'll see a big mall and a watertower. Go there.
Registration 5:00 to 6:00 PM, First car out 6:00 PM.  (You didn't think you'd
run a TOMBSTONE rally in the daylight did you.)

Be prepared for 4 hours of fun checking out the really backwater cemetaries
for clues to some tricky scavenger hunt type questions.  Normal dress
optional, prizes for costumes.
