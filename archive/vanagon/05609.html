Mike,
&gt; 
&gt;      I posted this to the net, but decided here might be a good place too.
&gt; My friend just got a '90 3.6L Porsche engine for his '86 Vanagon Syncro
&gt; Camper.  He is still waiting on the swap kit, but after it is installed
&gt; he wants to sell his old engine...
&gt; 
&gt; It is a...:
&gt; '86 Vanagon Syncro Engine (comes with exhaust, etc...everything not needed
&gt;     with the porsche engine)
&gt; 95,000 miles
&gt; Oil Changed every 2,000-2,500 miles
&gt; Owned/maintained by a VW Mechanic
&gt; Price = Don't know...Make him an offer....

Would you mind letting me know how he is planning on handling the heat issue?

I also would like to change to a Porsche engine in my Synchro but air
cooled versus water cooled has stumped me to date.

Thanks
Drew Jenkins
