Subject: Trip Planning


I'm planning on driving my '65 Camper from Dallas, Texas up 
to Michigan for Christmas and I would like to make it with 
the bus and I in one piece.  Anybody have any suggestions 
about stuff I should check out before the trip? I am mildly 
mechanical but am not opposed to getting it checked out 
professionally.

Any Ideas???
