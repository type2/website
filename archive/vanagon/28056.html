OK,

upon further call back he will want more with the computers
and f.i. system I believe.  He misunderstood the first time, but
this lot is a real back-woods don't know much about foreign car
value place.  A buddy once got a 15,000 mile 2.0 16V for $650 from
them for a rabbit pickup.  The guy is a straight shooter though
and the engine will have the mileage he says.  Hell one might even
dicker on the basic price of the engine if you tell him VW specialty
yards sell for less (I've done this sucessfully before stretching
the truth somewhat on above 16V).  Anyway I figure certainly
under $2,500 with everything.  Undoubtedly the engine alone will
be only $1500 though.  I believe it an early VR6 from a '93 with
the early style ignition, I'm not sure.  Anybody want it give him
a call, he might even ship.  I got no Vanagon, no dreams of air cooled
to VR6 conversion (though considering what it will cost me to
rebuild the 2.0 maybe I should) so here it is.

Engine is in a VW Passat.  I'm going to be kicking myself over this
later when I buy a VR6 Corrado won't I?  And some conjectures are
definitely correct, BMVW and Ron's Parts would probably be asking $5,000
for this engine or more with all the trimmings.  May it make somebody a
great conversion.  Anybody want to beat VW to a VR6 EV (Ric anyone?)

Go for it.
