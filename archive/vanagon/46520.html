Thanks to everybody who sent me info on aftermarket exhaust systems for my '87 
Westie. Looks like we can do better than VW prices, and I will impress my 
mechanic buddy with the wealth of information that you all sent me!

Now, I am noticing that the speedometer is going click click click, especially 
at highway speeds. Oh oh! Does this mean new speedometer cable, or new 
speedometer? I assume a new cable is No Bid Deal, but if it is a worn 
speedometer, what do I do??

Thanks,
-Steve

'87 Westie
