Subject: Noise under vehical

In a message dated 97-06-20 20:03:07 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu &gt;&gt;

The noise seems to be comming from under the van at about 50 but will do it
if you sorta rock the van at like 25-30.  If you push in and out on the
clutch while pushing on the gas .....just keep engaging the van.  But at the
same time I get a loud ding out of my driveshaft.  I hope its not those cv's
goin in the driveshaft there a littly pricy.

Thanks again for all your help....
