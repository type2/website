Subject: Cheap tits and ass....


Just got my copy of THE TRANSPORTER, the LiMBO newsletter...it was
a major disapointment....for the first time in a long time our
cub reporter Joel Walker DID NOT, yes kiddies, did not have an
article in THE TRANSPORTER! Perhaps Joel is spending too much
of his (and the Citizens (or is it denezens) of Allibammah) time
doin them stats....so folks give us people who payz good money
for our LiMBO dues a break...stop makin' Joel subdivide California,
Tennesee, etc., or comming out with different mutations of his
list....Joel needs to go back to some &quot;serious&quot; writin...


On the Tits and Ass front (or front and rear as the case might
be...) VW Trends (you remember the folks that not only brought
you Blonde Big Breasted Bimbo Bikini Bug Babes, &quot;Sano&quot;,
&quot;Bitchin'&quot;, etc...and don't have time for the likes of
us on the list) are trying to get VW Club members to
buy their mag at a $1.00/month....all you have to do
is to be a VW club member, and have your club submit a
check for $12 for each member who wants to buy VW T&amp;A...

As the ad says: &quot;An offer this good &lt;gag&gt; won't last forever
(thank Gawd...), so take advantage of this club special. Hey,
why read someone else's magazine when you can have your own
copy&quot;.... Kind of sounds like  hanging by the bathroom door
while your brother is in the can with the latest issue
of VW T&amp;A...and now you don't have to get &quot;stuck&quot; with
the sticky pages on the latest issue....

The ad goes on to say.... &quot;Don't be a mooch, fire up this deal
today!&quot;   Speaking of firing up....where did I put them
papers...? 


Oh well...you all know how much I love VW T&amp;A....oops Trends.
