Is it Monday?  Are the Perseids going to be any good this year?
Thursday night at midnight (PDT) the show should start.

Anyway, I replaced the backup light on my 81 this weekend.  An easy
task.  The old switch was working electrically, but it needed about
1/4 inch deflection before it shorted.  Obviously that was not enough
on this 13 year old transmission.  The new one that I got from local
VW FLAPS (Kohl_Weiss) was $10 and turns on with only about 1 mm
deflection.  It sure is going to be nice backing into the
***cliffside*** camping areas with some backup lights!

By the way I changed the tranny fluid as well, and found a nice
assortment of metal flakes attached to the magnetic drain plug.  Oh
boy.  I wonder how long it will last.  Right now it will slip out of
first gear on a downgrade, but that is really the only sign of wear.
The shifting is a little loose but I think that is mainly the linkage.
Any thoughts?

Finally, I seem to accumulate a good amount of dust in the engine
compartment after travelling down dirt roads.  I have looked for air
intake leaks with carb cleaner and have tried to seal them all, but I
am concerned that some of this dust will end up where it don't belong.
How much dust is &quot;normal&quot;?  And don't tell me to stay off dirt roads!

Monday it is.
