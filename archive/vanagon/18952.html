So Tobin Continent-Cruising Copley says:
&gt; &gt; Can anyone perhaps give me any advice on what to buy? I have been told 
&gt; &gt; that buying any VW bus before 74 is a safe idea. I have been told also 
&gt; &gt; that the type IV engine is troublesome.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there's a summary of changes in buses over the years out there some 
&gt; place (Steve Johnson, you have a copy handy??) that you might find 
&gt; helpful.  The 2L FI type IV in my hasn't really given me any problems, 
&gt; and I actually hear the type IV engine is highly reliable.  Comments, 
&gt; debate anyone?

The F.I. models are not too bad for reliability but a bit tough to 
diagnose when they do have problems.  I recommended to Jeff a '70 or 
'71 since they are mechanically cheaper to keep, but I would consider 
a later model like yours ('76 right?) if the body looked good and the 
engine had good compression (or the cost was low enough to justify a 
tired engine).  But if you were going to go that far, you might as
well buy an early air-cooled vanagon unless you prefer the breadloaf
body style as opposed to the brick style of the vanagon.

&gt; Someone refresh my memory: what happened in 74?  Introduction of dual 
&gt; carbs?  1800 motor?

Dual carbs till the second half of '74 when F.I. started.
It's tuff to maintain that setup mostly because of the smog equipment.
Especially in California.  Outside of Cal, most people put in after-
market carbs.  I've not heard of any problems with them otherwise.
Just more expensive upkeep than the earlier models.  That goes for
the '72's and '73's as well which had the larger 1700 engines.

BTW, I did forward the Bus Summary to Jeff.
