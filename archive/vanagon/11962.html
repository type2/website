Subject: Re: Air leaks in ventilation system


Travelled home to NH for Xmas/New Year holiday in the '78 siebsitzer.  No 
matter how far I moved the lever upward to seal the fresh air flap on the
nose, cold air POURED through, brrrrrrr.

Cheap/mid-holiday solution:  I cut up old styrofoam meat trays to fit in front
of the flap, removed the grille and stuck 'em in.  Still there, and I'm still
warm.  6 screws, hooray.
