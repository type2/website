Subject: Westy==Winnebago [Was:Fiche to Paper]

Yep. Winnebago is making a conversion out of the Eurovan platform. We saw 
one in the Minneapolis airport over Christmas. You don't have to worry 
Michael, I did not see any shag carpeting, Corinthian leather. It was 
a pretty tasteful interior, actually, but I would take my `70 Westy's 
interior any day. The exterior had the obligatory racing stripe (blue and 
ugly) you see on these second stage vehicles and there was a poptop. I 
don't remember many details, as I was trying to keep my 2 year from being 
runover by those damn golfcarts they use in the airports (You know, the 
ones that sound like an earthmover backing up...)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Westphalia, anything else is just an RV&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Ah!  But did you know that if your Westy has a bed,
&gt; &gt;porta-potty and a sink, that there is a tax write-off
&gt; &gt;for it because it is considered an RV!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So, all others are just Minivans.  ;)
