&gt;
&gt;When I am trying to set my timing, it varies a few degrees
&gt;justidiling.,  I am assuming that htis is bad.
&gt;
&gt;What is going on????
&gt;
sticking vacuum advance plus air leaks on the intake side maybe, leading to 
irregular advance. Bad valves cause vacuum fluctuation also. Disconnect the 
vacuum and see if it settles down, if it doesn't then the distributer gear 
may be worn/sloppy. Is it steady at faster speeds? If so then drive at least 
that fast! wheee... tim s.
