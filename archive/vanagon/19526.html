Subject:        B&amp;P's - help!!

This is just a quick question...for all you engine guru's.
I bought some 1600 b&amp;p's on the guarantee from Volkspares that the 
1500 &amp; 1600 are totally interchangable - the 1600 b&amp;p's would go 
straight onto the 1500 case &amp; heads..........and would give a little 
more power without any machine work. Is this correct?? Or do I need 
to rethink??Any tips??  Thanks for any replies....

Cheers
Ricky
