Subject: Re: 65 Panel Van questions...

I have those same cheesy camper windows cut into my 59'.
After much advice I believe I'm going to just put some
fiberglass panels in there.  Welding original metal in 
could cause much warping which leads to bondo ;{
The sheet metal on mine is not all that thick.  Maybe I'm all wrong about this 
but I still have until spring to decide. Do ya know how much any of this will 
cost?  Let ME know. I'm in the same boat you are.
                                   good luck- Benjamin
