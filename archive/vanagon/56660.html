Subject: RE: What Service Do I Need? 

Change all fluids, especially brake and clutch hydraulics, and coolant.

Have the torque checked on your head studs.

Check suspension alignment.

&gt;I recently bought my Father-in-laws 1991 Westfalia.  It has 63,000 kms on it
&gt;(39,000 miles).  This is low kms for the age of the vehicle.  He went by the
&gt;book as far as servicing the vehicle however, he only adhered to suggested
&gt;mileage intervals between servicing, not time intervals.  This means the
&gt;vehicle was serviced about once a year including oil changes.
&gt;
&gt;I am about to get the vehicle serviced for the first time.  In light of the
&gt;lack of frequent service, is there anything I should ask the mechanic to do
&gt;or check?  
&gt;
&gt;Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated.
