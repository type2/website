I'm trying to sell this bus because I just bought another one (a 1966) =
instead. Here is the info:

Interior- mint condition
Exterior- no major rust, except for a little surface rust
Original paint- light brown/off-white
Original engine, partly rebuilt
Camper bus-no pop-top; there IS an icebox and table and water pump

It drives pretty well. The engine could be looked at, but besides that, =
you won't be able to find many in such good condition. For more info, =
call: (407)647-4396, and ask for David. I'm offering it at $3500/obo. =
Let me know if you're interested. Thanks
