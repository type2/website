Subject: Re:sticky or noisy tappets (hyd)

Oops -- I'm kinda fertgetful right now (late post-pub Sat)
Somebody wrote about noisy tappets:
 
&gt;Just let'em be!, they'll pump up again in a minute or so. DON'T rev the
&gt;engine to help this out! Just let the 20-W-50 build up some heat and
&gt;pressure to flow back into the lifters.
 
I did a rebuild on a '77 2 liter that someone rebuilt, by the look of
the bearings, not too long ago. They inseerted hydraulic lifters, but kept the
&quot;mechanical&quot; pushrods. Which are a different length. The engine went kaput.
 
Anyway, I bled the lifters. First I tried the Bentley method of bleeding, which
was a big ol' pain. Then I called MOFOCO, in Milw. WI, which did the machining.
They told me to just squish the air out of the tappets while under oil. This
method is recommended by the Wilson book.
 
I assembled and adjusted the valves (like in Bentley) with my bled lifters. My
question is whether I should consider re-adjusting the valves or if the
hydraulic lifters are doing their job. I've got about 500 miles on the rebuild.

group. There are four on my block alone!!!
