Subject:      WTB or info needed: complete set of coolant hoses for 2.1

Kyle, Ron, or others who have done it:

I want to replace all rubber coolant hoses on my 86 Westy.  Can a complete
set of rubber hoses be purchases all at once to do this, or do I have to
pull each one and go up to a parts sales counter?

I would rather have the complete set in hand and then start taking off all
of the old rubber hoses.  This would include the radiator hoses (maybe even
the twin van length ones), heater hoses (although it looks like bulk
standard heater hose would work), all the misc. short, large and small
rubber hoses up near the engine, and the transluscent tubes that run up
around the lip of the engine compartment, too.  Every time I'm under the
van, I notice a new coolant hose previously concealed from view.  Any one
of these looks like it could lead to catestrophic coolant lose someday if
gone unreplaced.

Thanks for the help.
