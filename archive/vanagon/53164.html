Subject: Re: Trouble starting

I live in Portland, Oregon where it is occasionally damp (snicker,
snicker) My 87 syncro has had the same problem, turn the key no sound
but a buzzing from the engine compartment. Wait a little bit and she
starts just fine. Gave the van to my mechanic to check it out and of
course he couldn't duplicate the problem. He checked all the usuale
places ie ground straps, sensors etc....No luck. He recommended that
next time it occured to open up the back hatch and have someone turn the
key while I bang on the starter solenoid with a wrench. I've done this a
couple of times and every time I do it works. As soon as I whack the
solenoid the van starts right at the time of the whack. I've read
several other posts in regards to this problem and this seems to be the
best answer: replace the starter which comes with the solenoid in one
package. It's Monday the 16th and on Teusday I'm having a new starter
installed.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought an 89 Westy.  I've noticed that it has trouble
&gt; starting when it's very damp out.  I live in Montreal and it's
&gt; been raining alot lately.  I was told that adding gas-line
&gt; anti-freeze will help.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments?
