&gt;Howdy Volks,
&gt;Friday night I finished dropping out the engine and tranny from the 
&gt; &quot;lima bean&quot; and now I have to spend some money. To bring you up to 
&gt; date, this is a 78 westie that I bought knowing it had troubles. I now 
&gt; know how serious of trouble I bought. It looks as if I am going to 
&gt; need to replace the engine with a rebuild, I would like to do this 
&gt; myself but I don't think I will have the time in the next six months 
&gt; to do a proper job. I would like comments on what the different 
&gt; suppliers products are like, how reliable? What kind of quality? Any 
&gt; service issues?
&gt;Amother problem with this bus was that even though it was in gear it 
&gt; would not move, if you revved up the engine then it would inch 
&gt; forward. It felt like the worst slipping clutch in history. Upon 
&gt; separating the bell housing from the engine it was obvious that demons 
&gt; are at work. The piece that is bolted to the front of the tranny that 
&gt; surrounds the input shaft  is melted.  I cant think this is normal. I 
&gt; have not pulled the pressure plate yet, I need to construct something 
&gt; to hold the flywheel because there appears to be  a lot of torque on 
&gt; the mounting bolts. When I do I suspect I am going to see a very 
&gt; unusual wear pattern on the clutch disk. I will keep you informed.

The tool that is sold to hold Beetle flywheels also works on the Bus.  The
best rebuild available comes from the VW dealer.  They are the only ones I've
found so far that resurfaces and align bores the case.  Gex is also a very
good supplier and they offer some excelent waranty options. The most
important part of rebuilding these engines is making sure everything is
straight and true. otherwise, anyone  can do it with attention to detail and
patience.  Note that no one will waranty the engine if it shows any signs of
being over heated.  The rebuildrers install melting plugs that give this
condition away.  Get the Bentley manual or the Idiot book to find out what
goes where and how tight it should be.
