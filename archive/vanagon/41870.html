Subject: Re: Do You Love Your Bus? (VL, very soppy, paean of praise to my dead bus)

Do I love my Bus?  Kinda tough right now, as I'm just a wannabus, but when I
had one I did.  And I don't understand why.  Perhaps someone can explain it.
 And it seems to be genetic as well.  My mother is almost as crazy about
Vanagons as I am (although she doesn't have the pins, the custom airbrushed
T-shirt, the sales brochures for every model year, etc.).  Ever since I saw
my first Vanagon back in '79 I've been infatuated.  Our first one (an '80)
became part of the household in '81, and I must admit that I did shed a tear
when we had to sell it (major engine trouble).  The second in the house was
my first, an '83 1/2 that served me well until one Gia Hu Tong decided to
make a very illegal left turn.  Almost simultaneously my mother and I each
got our second Vanagons, both '90s.  I've mentioned the plight of mine in
past postings, and my mother still has hers.  I just don't understand it.  My
girlfriend has to wonder about me, as I do have a bit of a wandering eye; not
for other girls, but for any Vanagon that may pass us by.  And I'd drop my
current car in a heartbeat for the chance at owning another Vanagon...
