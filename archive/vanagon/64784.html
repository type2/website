Subject:      Re: Brake pads

I had the same PROBLEM. The pads are so hard that the rotors wear at
about the same rate as the pads. The blackened metallic substance was
also a nuisance to remove from the wheels every week. I do not have this
problem with the new pads. They are cheaper and easier to replace than
rotors also.

&gt;I've got 141k on my vanagon.  Still running the original brake pads, and
&gt;they are still about half there.  So, when 280k comes around, what
&gt;should I look for in brake pads?  Does everyone elses brake pads last as
&gt;long?  Always had to replace them sooner on my other cars.
&gt;
&gt;Just wondering.
