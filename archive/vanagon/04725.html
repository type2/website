Subject: Will Volvo seats go in my bus?

So, like, last week I'm checking out the Bus Stop catalog and adding up
what it would cost to re-do the front seats in my '76 Camper.  Hmmm...
looks like roughly $100 per seat to buy new foam and upholstry, then talk
a friend into helping me.

But wait - yesterday on a local .forsale newsgroup I see:
2 front seats from a Volvo 240 (driver's side seat is heated!)
$100 takes both

Does anyone have any idea if these seats would go in a bus?
