Subject: Re: repost: 82 camper for sale (Ohio)

On Mon, 15 Aug 1994, Joel Walker forwarded:

&gt; '82 VW Pop-top Camper For Sale.  Only 86,000 miles total and less than 10,000
&gt; on the rebuilt engine.  The body is rust-free and in remarkable condition,

Doesn't it seem strange that it needed a new engine after only 76K miles?

Or am I just a nay sayer?
