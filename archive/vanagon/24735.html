Subject: Re: Oregon Bashing

I interpret all (or at least most) of this as &quot;all in good fun&quot;.  The great
thing about life is we are all intitled to our own interpretation....
I was in Oregon a few years ago doing w/ my girlfriend/now wife and had a 
blast.  One of the top areas (Pacific NW) that I'd like to live in.
