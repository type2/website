Subject: seat covers 

hi mark and all concerned about your vanagons and such. ive been an
upholsterer about all my life and there is a company on the east coast that
will make &quot;generic&quot; seat covers for just about anything. the most off the
wall one i can remember ordering was for a 66 p-180 volvo about 2 years ago.
and the company made it up and shipped it to me and i put in on for my
customer and for both front seats including labor and supplies was around
275-300 in there. alot more if i custom made them. but the covers are not
perfect but do the job. you will still need to remove the old cover and hog
ring on the new. also there selection of materials are not totally for
someone that must have it stock. if anyone is interested they can let me
know and ill dig up there name but i believe they are a wholesale outfit so
you would need to call around to a local upholstery shop to look at the
samples that they carry. hope this helps C-Ya Jonce
