I sent this out yesterday but it appears to have found it's way into the e-mail
black hole on our server. Apologies to anyone who has suffered through it twice.


Thanks to Eric Oster for the ratio data for microbuses. Here is the updated
index.

  Hey, these numbers are almost all the same! Coincidence, or by design?
  
  
  In an effort to BAIT you Vanagon and EV owners into opening that Bentley and
  mailing in ratio info I am going to SPECULATE that the lowest wear index #,
  down close to 1400 ft./mile will go to the 1.9 wasserleakers (wear index has
  nothing to do with head gasket life, sorry.) and that the highest, pushing
  2000 ft/mile, will go to the willing little diesel.
  
  So, C'mon and prove me wrong! Send in the top gear ratio, the final drive
  ratio, the engine stroke and the tire size (if it's an EV)!
  
  
  Thanks in advance!
