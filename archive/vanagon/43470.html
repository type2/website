Subject: EV hoods, and such...

I believe it was Dan H. who mentioned a problem w/ a flooded
hood, to which I just had to eyeball mine and say:
Well, Dan, there're enough weep holes and open slots on the
inside of that hood, that, 1.) your hood design is way different
than the average run of the mill '93 EV, or, 2.) you've got some
serious wildlife building dams and stuff around the drainage holes.
:-)

On a somewhat related note, have any of you EV'ers noticed the
fine VW sex wax (can I say that on this list?...) that's been seeping
out of the weep holes at the bottom of the front doors, now that 
it's getting pretty damn hot around these parts?  I know the stuff
is anti-rust &quot;goop&quot; but there's enough of that stuff leaking out
that I'm surprised the whole inside of the door isn't made out of
it.
