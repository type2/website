Subject: Re: Problem w/ power window switch on '91 Vanagon

Try taking the switch apart and use contact cleaner on it. My wife's
Volvo has a problem with the switches getting carbon build up on the
points as they seem to take the full voltage thru them, no relay, I do
this about once a month and they work fine. It also helps to have a few
spare switches around so I can clean them at my leasure.
