&gt; Does anyone where I could get either 1) a 110 degree automatic water 
&gt; valve (like a thermostat) or 2) a 110 degree water temperature 12 volt switch?
If the storage container is plastic, I'd be careful about heating
water past 110F, because the plastic must be designed to take heat and
eventually it will become brittle. Perhaps you need a container
designed to take heat for extended periods? DC

&gt; For safety sake, I want to make sure this contraption will automatically 
&gt; turn off when the water gets to 110 degrees. The last time I built one of 
&gt; these heat exchangers, the water would sometimes get to boiling. Not very 
&gt; safe for a shower.
