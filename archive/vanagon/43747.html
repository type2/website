Subject: coolant bleeder

Hello,

I recently got my first watercooled westy and I was instructed on how to
bleed air from the coolant system using the engine compartment valve. I
tried it to see if any air was in there but when I unscrewed the valve
nothing happened, no air and no drop of coolant. Is this a good sign? Is
the valve bad? I was just curious as to how to do it in case the need to
really do it ever came along. Thanks in advance for any insights.
