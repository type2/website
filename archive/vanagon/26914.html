Subject:       Re: 65 bus won't start

&gt; I let it sit again for a few minutes and try once more but get the
&gt; same results.  I was late for work so I didn't get a chance to check
&gt; things out thoroughly.  I'm pretty much a novice mechanic, so any
&gt; ideas on what to check or if someone has had a similiar problem,
&gt; your help would be much appreciated.

I just went throught a similar bout on my '57.  The accelerator pump 
mechanism was bye-bye.  The bus wouldn't start at all if you gave it 
any gas.  After pulling off the carb and checking that the membrane 
on the acc. pump is not decayed/torn, I pulled out the float and 
noticed the little &quot;bb&quot; (as I call it) had fallen out from under its 
little &quot;pellet&quot; looking holder in the bottom of the bowl.  That cured 
my problems... well one of them anyhow!

You might, when your engine is _cold_ pull off the gas line to the 
carb, manually turn over the engine by twisting the generator pully 
(in neutral) to see if the fuel pump is squirting gas.
