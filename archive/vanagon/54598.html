Subject: RE: Engine seized 

You might want to post on the Type 2 mail list for this question.  They deal with air cooled 
Vanagons.

&gt;Thanks for all the advice so far...its helped..
&gt;However lastnight the engine seized.
&gt;Its only a 2year old factory rebuild, but got heated up and blew its
&gt;heads due to a loss of waterpump belt.
&gt;
&gt;We dropped the engine and trans today. After seperating the trans, we
&gt;tried to turn the flywheel with the plugs out....it turns 3/4 of the way
&gt;but then jams up.  My friend believes that something could have gotten
&gt;stuck in one of the cam/gears causing it to get stuck.
&gt;Before it seized THe engine would run errattic...some times on 4
&gt;cylinders, sometime missing....
&gt;
&gt;We are going to crack the case this week...my friend is pretty adept at 
&gt;engine rebuilds, but we are toying with the idea of a 6cylinder
&gt;porshe conversion Type4 , or even an Air cooled Bus Engine.
&gt;Is there any sources of info for such a conversion?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks..
&gt;John in Melbourne
