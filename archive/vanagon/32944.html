Subject: Do you know this van?

Last summer I was driving back from the Columbia River Gorge after a 
weekend of some good windsurfing.  I pulled off at the exit by Portland 
Meadows race track to gas up (I get 15 mpg with all the boards up top.  
As I was fueling I noticed a White maybe '89 Westy with a full RV AC 
unit mounted up top.  He was accelerating out of the parking lot.  I 
noticed a loud throaty exhaust note and that the van was squatting 
under the accelaration forces like a pooch begging for a bone.  Just 
wondering if anyone knows this van and what the heck is under the rear 
deck????
