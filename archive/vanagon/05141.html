&gt; O.K.  two problems I've been meaning to fix on the 'falia.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Calvin (my Golden Retriever) has now torn both of my
&gt;    side window screens.  They have become unattached from
&gt;    the plastic frame.  It looks as though the screens were
&gt;    attached with glue or heat pressed on?  Anyway, what's
&gt;    best way to replace the screens?  The tough part looks
&gt;    like getting access to the inside of the sliding window.
&gt;    I noticed someone posted how to remove those windows but
&gt;    it sure doesn't appear easy.

True, it's not easy to get them out, but it's not really all that hard either.
If you look at the track the screens sit in you'll notice a &quot;cutout&quot; or slot
towards the back.  There are two tangs or built in clips on the top and bottom
of the screen.  Move the screen back so that the rear tang (you may be able to
see them if you look at the screen from the side) coincides with the slot.  Pull
the screen towards you, gently so you don't crack the plastic.  With a little
wiggling it should come out.  

Before you do all this go to the hardware store and get some fiberglass netting
and a hot glue gun, if you don't already have them.  You can get cheapo guns
for &lt; $10.  Rip out the old screen and clean up the lip where they were attached
with a knife.  Cut a piece of netting to fit the opening, you can use the old
piece if there's enough left to use as a template.  Tack one edge down, wait till
it sets up then pull the opposite edge taut and tack it down.  Then do the same
to the other two sides.  Once everything is cool and dry check to see that the
screen is taut enough, if not lift the tack points (don't use too much glue
initially to make this part easier and only tack it down at &lt;= 4 points) , reposition
the screen and redo it.  Once it's as you want it, draw a nice wide bead all the 
way around.  Let that dry, check it one last time and reinstall it.

I've done that on both my screens in the last year and have had no problems
at all.  We'll see how the glue stands up to a Colorado Winter, but being inside
the van it should be ok.


&gt; 2. The wiper fluid pump no longer works.  I saw yesterday that
&gt;     it might be possible to check if it's frozen or does this just
&gt;    apply to the water (sink) pumps?  Also, where is and how do I
&gt;    get to it.
&gt;

Sorry, don't think I've ever gone looking for it.  Can't help you there. 
Once you find it though the trick is to run the battery output DIRECT
to the input leads.  Do this with jumper cables and short jumper wires
attached to the cables.  This way you make sure you're not wasting current
on resistive losses.  If the fluid or water pump works at all and it's just
&quot;stuck&quot; for whatever reason, this'll get it going again.

&gt; Thanks.
