Subject: Re: New Head Gasket Stud Kit From Raceware

&gt;For all I know, it is worth it. I wonder if this means Raceware allows you
&gt;to increase the torque even further beyond the new higher torque specs issue
&gt;by the factory to stab at the head gasket leak problem.
&gt;
&gt;Hummm...

WOW!! very exciting, maybe the engine replacement thread is finished, :)

what about the stuff that these studs are going to be threaded into?
wouldn't this metal have to be stronger also?  I tried calling them for more
information and they are on vacation and their answering machine is not
accepting messages, arrgh.
