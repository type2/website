&gt;Fellow Vanamaniacs (especially H2Oers),

&gt;Just noticed this morning a few drips of coolant on the bracing under the
&gt;engine of the '87 Syncro GL.  This was after a -10 night (-54 wind chill).
&gt;  We may be getting to -15 tonight.  Is the leak something to worry about or
&gt;just something to watch with the temperature drops?  It wasn't much of a
&gt;leak(hadn't done it before) and while the coolant level was at the minimum it
&gt;did come up to normal when the engine temp was up.
&gt;
&gt;Just wanting to know.

Brad... could be just a &quot;Weep&quot; of some sort, in other words, nothing to
worry about, but on the other hand, your water pump could have blown a seal.
(very typical thing to happen in the cold with a h2o cooled vehicle).  I had
an olds and a buick that both had water pumps go out in the chicago winters.
But now I live further south and drive o2 cooled vehicles (no offense to
your GL).  Hope its nothing serious. :)
