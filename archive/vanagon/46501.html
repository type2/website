&gt; Subject: Re: Riviera Campwagen (was Change the Stats)

 I recently purchased 2 Riviera Campwagens. One was a '77 from
&gt; California, the other a '78 from Alabama that was built on a
&gt; Champaigne Edition bus (brown dash, clock, chrome bumpers, etc.).
&gt; They are outfitted slightly differently (if you read the manual,
&gt; there are many different options available).  For example, the '77
&gt; has only an icebox, while the '78 has a fridge. Neither has the
&gt; optional forced air furnace.  Both are missing the original toilet.
&gt;
As was stated in an earlier post, these conversions have the full double bed
pop top, which sits ON TOP of the roofline, unlike the Westy's, which have the
roof hacked, welded, and braced. Because of this, I am desparately seeking one
of these tops for my bus, which is a '67 with the small camper top. I wish the
double bed, without doing massive amounts of roofwork. So, if anyone has an
extra one, or knows where I can purchase one, please let me know.
PS, I have seen other splits with late model tops on. While the fit is not
beautiful, it does work ok.
Thanks,
Richard
