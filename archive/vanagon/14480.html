&gt;Check for holes in the exhaust or missing/poorly fitting exhaust gaskets.  
&gt;I've had problems with the exhaust &quot;donut-gasket&quot; things that mate the 
&gt;muffler (4 tip monza) to my heat exchanger pipe.  It seems through either 
&gt;some fault of my own in securing the gasket or perhaps the muffler pipe is 
&gt;too large relative to the heat exchanger pipe, I would &quot;lose&quot; the gaskets
&gt;--either they would disintegrate or get sucked into the muffler pipe.

Hey Ron, 
 Maybe I missed something but how does the donut gasket that is commonly
placed around/onto the heater box or &quot;J&quot; tube get &quot;sucked into the muffler
pipe&quot;??????
I've had eternal (sometimes nocturnal) problems getting the darned clamps to
seal and stay secured but never had one sucked into the muffler pipe. What
do I know, Hell I didn't even know what a &quot;Bjork&quot; was!!! :)
