Well yug, why? There is a bunch of us with wasserboxers
that have added it. It did reduce the dripping of coolant
from my engine but I have noticed that the temperatue will
creep up when the engine is warm and at idle. I'm not 
sure that I had this problem before adding Bars Leaks, I've
only had the van since April.
