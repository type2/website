Subject: Stuck Parking Brake

My first problem with my Westy (91).  I went to leave the driveway today and
couldn't move a bit.  I determined one of the right rear wheel was locked.
I jacked it up, pulled the wheel off and wacked the wheel with a hammer a
few times.  It's good as new for now but I am afraid it will happen again.

Can anyone suggest any preventative maintainance for this affliction?
Please, please don't tell me this is the warning sign for a major problem.

Thanks listees.
