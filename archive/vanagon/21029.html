The Vanagon has this persistent problem of hard hot starting. This has been
consistent since we got the van a year ago and since then the battery has
been renewed without  solving the problem. Joel suggested that I properly
ground the egine case and clean all eclectrical connections thoroughly,
which I did. I also replaced the battery ground strap and cleaned the
trans ground strap.

My question is: will this solenoid piggy-backing solve the hot start
problem or am I barking up the wrong tree.....

Usually I associate a hard starting hot engine with an overly lean mixture
- but everything seems ok in that respect....

TIA
