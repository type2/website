Subject: RE: Westy: '74-79 vs '80-83 which is better?


&gt;I've sort of decided the Vanagon style is more practical (ie: larger,
&gt;usually more standard camping features, etc.), but I still like the
&gt;'funkiness' of the earlier bus style. I like driving both, but don't
&gt;quite get that 'feeling' when driving the Vanagon vs. the bus. Am I
&gt;nuts...?
   &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Of course, my wife prefers the Vanagon, probably because I feel (and
&gt;act) about 10 years younger (I'm 28) when driving a bus....  :-)
&gt;
&gt;Did any of that make sense...? Good thing it's Friday...!

It's not a car... it's a way of life.

Go for the loaf!
