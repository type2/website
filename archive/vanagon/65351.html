Subject:      Re: AC noise like PS PUMP!

If the mechanics are game they could evacuate the system then run it
without the freon. If the noise is gone I would say you have a big
obstruction. What are the gauges reading when it is running? You did not
mention if the system cools .

&gt;is, noise is still there and the hoses vibrate including the one that
&gt;runs through the drivers wheel well. Mechanics are scratching thier
&gt;heads. Any help gratefully appreciated.
