Okay, I got a pretty easy one for those of you
that know...

How interchangable/swap-able are the switches in the
master cylinder???  I was checking my connection out and
one of the push-on stubs broke off on in the push-on while
trying to make a better connection.  Soooo I gotta get another
switch.  It's for the '64 Single cab.  What's my window of
interchange here?

Thanks,
