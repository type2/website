&gt;OK Folks,

&gt; - Things the map shows in the Columbia Area :
&gt;     * Yankee Hill Winery 209.533.2417 with Tasting, Tours &amp; Retail Sales
&gt;     * Downtown Designated Bike Route
&gt;     * Columbia State Historic Park
&gt;     * Moaning Cavern (4 mi. further on Parrots Ferry Road)
&gt;       (yea, yea, get your mind out of the gutter)
&gt;
Moaning Cavern is absolutely awesome ! ! ! - imagine a mountain hollowed
out (by time &amp; water) with a hole at the very top;  You rappel down &amp; into
a cavern big enough to hold the Statue of Liberty, base &amp; all.  Below you
notice ants milling around in the dim light, &amp; get a shock as you realize
you're looking at the helmets of previous rappellers - very disorienting &amp;
a great rush. (aren't fear and apprehension the best highs of all???).
