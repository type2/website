I confess. On behalf of my 1965 VW EZCamper, I am on the vanagon list. We
are lurking here in Bakersfield, Calif., 106 miles north of LosAngeles. The
camper, a non-Westie conversion built from a panel van in Littlerock, CA.,
just turned 30 years old in February. Fourth owner, third engine, still on
first paint job (not counting those pesky blind spots on the back corners.)
