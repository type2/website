Subject: CV Joints

Just a quick note; You were asking about cheep places for CV 
joints. I personally have had the experience of replacing my CV
joints twice, in about as many weeks. I originally bought some 
&quot;inexpensive&quot; CV boots from a mail-order VW parts dealer, and installed
them. A couple weeks later, I notice the same sounds that
you were describing, particularly when I took a corner one
certain way. Looking underneath, I found that the outside CV boots had 
both split, one more severe then the other. I called them up, and they
said I must have installed them wrong. I spent the money, got good 
quality CV boots, and haven't had a problem with them in the three
years I have had them on. In short, the CV boots are a place where you
want the highest quality you can afford; otherwise you might end up
saving that 80 bucks for beer, but not be able to drive to the store to 
pick it up :(
