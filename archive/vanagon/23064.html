Dan,
Stop worrying.  That's exactly what I see when I check mine.

&gt; harming something?  i don't mention it to my wife but i wonder if she 
&gt; notices.  ya know, this is really starting to bother me...
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;if the above thinking ever goes through YOUR head seek professional

&gt; 
&gt; Here's my question:
&gt; &gt;From the flame indicator, i notice an orange glow in addition to the 
&gt; blue flame.  i assume this is from either the tip of the piezo electrode or the 
&gt; safety shut off.  do others see this in their flames (What Do You See 
&gt; in the Flame, Grasshopper?)?  Did i re-assemble something wrong?  
&gt; Help me out so I don't have to stew about this over the weekend!
