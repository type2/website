&gt; OK so if the fluid isn't leaking out the front master and the car hasn't
&gt; moved since the last top-up, the only other way it could leak out is through
&gt; the
&gt; force of gravity. So my next job is to find the &quot;lowest point&quot; in the van
&gt; and that's where the fluid will be. Not.

If the clutch slave cylinder springs a leak internal to the clutch assembly
you would find no external evidence.  I would assume that the clutch would
eventually become glazed and start slipping.  The slave cylinder is lower 
than the brake fluid reservoir.  Have you ruled out the brake system based
on the fact that the brake fluid will not drain past the point where the
clutch system tapps into the reservoir?
