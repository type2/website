Subject: [All] trans 'rinse'

Hi folks, a general enquiry..

Time to change out my gear oil in the std. transmission.  I want to give it
a rinse before refilling.  I re/re'd with dino-juice last spring, so the oil
has only one year on it, but I want to try and get some more crud out.  I
remember a list posting of re/re using a couple of quarts of ATF in the
trans then driving for a short while.  This supposedly helped flush out
crud.  Any wise advice on this or other 'rinses' possible would be
appreciated. Finally, any comments on adding MolySlip trans additive? I
trust its molybdenum disulphite to protect the trans (no Slick50 thanks!)
but what about GL rating probs???   Tim Smith
