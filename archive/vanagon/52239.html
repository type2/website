Subject: Westfalia features!

We had a thread a while ago about several people not knowing about the oil
filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
revolve!  Any others out there?

Incidentally, on the same weekend I saw a VR6 Winnie, first I have seen -
the folks had the top popped but did not come out the whole weekend!  Heard
to furnace going though!

Also saw a breadloaf Westy camping with 7 adults!  True!  It was a full
Westy too.  They had two tents and I tried to see how they fitted in the
van but could not see anyone inside due to the &quot;stuff&quot;!  I guess they sat
on the floor.
