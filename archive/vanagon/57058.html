Subject: Van lifters sticking - 83

        So I broke down and took my van to the shop to remedy the electrical
and engine noise problem, since its still waay to cold to try fixing it
myself, and Id probably electrocute myself in the attempt.
        So the shop called me to tell me that the niose was from sticking
lifters. I was told to drive the van as usual for the next while, as it may
remedy the situation itself. And if it persists to bring it back. What can I
do to help the situation at all. Can a somehow get in there and clean em up
a bit or what? Suggestions please.
        And on the electrical side of things, it turns out that the fried
wire my friend had replaced had burnt up, or toasted part of that thin paper
and wire control board that is in behind the dash. Shop said $150-200 to
repair (including labor and the new board).

        At least this shop vivit didnt set me back to much...so I can still
continue to save for the big one that does. :)
