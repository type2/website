Subject: Syncro Exhaust pipe INFO!

Listees,

  I have a bit of info that I wanted to share with the list.

  Recently I installed a 2wd ERxhaust manifold on a Syncro!  ONLY the #2&amp;4 pipe will 
work!  But still this saves ALL Syncro owners $$$.

  I just wanted to pass this on and I hope it helps someone else out in the future:)

  Kyle
