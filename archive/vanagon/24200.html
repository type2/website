Subject: early bus compartment under seat????

matt &amp; Michael:

The compartments under the seats are for tools and jack, in
splits, bubbles and Vanagons.  In the Vanagon they also
moved the battery up front t it under the passenger seat.

To my knowledge there was never a cover for the older buses.
Vanagons have a hinged cover (walk-thru models) on both but
it only covers part of the hole.  Also, Vanagons have a foam
rubber lining which must serve as sound-deadening.  It's not
a very tough material.

&gt;One well was for tools, the other for a jack, I believe... was this
&gt;discontinued in Vanagons?

&gt;&gt; that should say enough.  does anyone know what this compartment was
&gt;&gt; originally for.  both of my 1960 bus's have them as well as every bus i
&gt;&gt; have ever seen.  it looks like there could be a cover for it, but i have
&gt;&gt; never seen one.  walk through's even have a smaller version.   any ideas
&gt;&gt; as to it's origin?
&gt;&gt; thanks and God BLess
