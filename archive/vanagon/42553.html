Subject: Re: '67 Westy Resto form Hell Update

piles. The guru looked at the mfg date on the back and stated that I oughta
get the &quot;correct&quot; month (11/66 or 9/66) handles rechromed vs using a perfect
set which carry a slightly earlier date (2/66). I think I will rush right
down and get it done just because he said so. ;-) I think this is worth the
cash and potential chrome shop hell especially since the date is on the
inside of the handle and is about eight point type. I think I will risk
- - - 

the difference between the 2/66 handle and the 9/66 handle is the earlier one
is for the 66 model year.  67 model year started in late 66, and they changed
the locks from the T series key to the Lseries key.    67 model year door
handles tend to break if wailed on, as the key is longer, so the handle is
less sturdy.  if you see a bus with a broken cargo door handle, odds are its
a 67.   keep the mechanism greased!   using it will give you one (correct)
key for all locks.


happy camping
