Subject: 65 Panel Van questions...

I am _considering_ repairing the past injustices wrought upon my (ex) 65
panel van.

A way back when the panel van had some really cheesy camper windows hacked
into it above the &quot;beltline&quot; on the drivers side.

I am _considering_ replaceing the panel with the windows hacked in to it
with the _correct_ replacement panel from a 66' panel van that i found in a
wreckers. my question is has anyone ever undertaken this procedure? aside
from the obvious job of cutting out the old panel and welding a &quot;new&quot; one
back in, are there any other unforseen difficulties? (i.e. unibody sagging
etc) Maybe it is easier to simply fill in the exisiting holes where the
windows were cut in and just repaint the panel?

also anyone out there seen a dormobile roof for a split window bus? my
georgraphic search is for the n.e. usa or in canada in the provinces of
quebec or ontario.

thanks in advance...

michael
