Subject: gauge info for vanagon


Ok, here is the good news...
 I finally got hold of a stock gauge cluster which has a tach and a digital
 clock.. My original set of instruments had only a temp and gas gauge and
 was in very poor condition.. The plastic which hold the entire thing
 together was cracked and the area of the film where connecter is located
 was in sad shape...so it was barley working...

 I replaced the old with the new and at first everything seemed to be in 
 order.. but i soon realized that the tach was jumpy when other electrical
 consumers are turn on...and after i drive for a little while the tach begins
 to kinda go haywire... also when i first switch on the ignition, the oil
 pressure and alt. lights come on, but they do not blink...other than that
 them seem to work properly... I am looking for help...

 I might have a ground problem or something like that or maybe there is a 
 difference in the wiring.. my transporter is a 86' and the used set
 of instruments i have are about the same age.. the swap seems to be in 
 order, but something is not right.. if any one has any info
 I would really appreciate it...

 thank you
