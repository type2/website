&gt; If you consider a swap like this (as I have many times), keep in mind that 
&gt; the transmission main shaft is different - shorter for the type 1, I 
&gt; believe.  So, if you decide it's still worth it, and get a complete 
&gt; tranny/engine set for swap, it will work.  

That should not be necessary. One of my '71 busses has a '73 (or maybe
'74) tranny in it. Although the input shaft is a half inch or so longer,
that has caused no problems. In fact, we really enjoy being able to
go faster in 4th gear since the gear ratio allows 4000 RPM to be
80 mph instead of 65.

Anyone else using a later mode tranny with a 1600 engine?
