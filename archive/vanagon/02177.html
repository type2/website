Subject: anyone know of any great west coast junkyards?

Hello,
	I have a '84 I would love to convert to being a camper.   For cost
reasons, I would be very happy even with just a fold down bed and skip the
poptop and sink/stove/closet setup.  I have pulled the middle seat out and
currently my SO and I sleep diagonaly.  :)  I live in the southern part of
Oregon and I could drive as far as S.F. or Seattle.  L.A. would be a drag
because that's around 14 hours or so.  Anyone know of any junkyard that
might have a variety of campers?  
	I'm thinking about making a poster and sending it to all the
oregon and N Cal VW dealers and repair shops to perhaps find one before it
gets to the junkyard.  Maybe I could offer a bounty. :)  Out of curiosity,
has anyone doen something like this?

Thanks,

Alan
