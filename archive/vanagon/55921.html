Subject: Vanagon Heat Vents - Update #2

Hi all,
Last week I wrote:

&gt;I stated that 87 &amp; earlier vans could only produce non-heated air from these
&gt;vents, and that heated air from these vents was a feature that began with
the
&gt;1988 models.
&gt;
&gt;A couple of people wrote to prove me wrong.  I've gathered a little more
info
&gt;and can say with a little certainty that this change was made in mid 1987.
&gt; Here's what I know about some 87s and their dash heat

Here's a few more data points than I had before:

David Bayer's 87 Syncro: VIN 003730, No heat, USA model
My (Jim Davis) 87 Syncro: VIN 007589, No heat, USA model
Austin's 87 Syncro: VIN 032970, No heat, USA model
Mark McCulley's 87: VIN 037810, No heat, USA model
Bernie Campoli's 87: VIN 043103, No heat, USA model
A friends 87 Wolfsburg: VIN 050426, No heat, USA model

Dave's 87 Wolfsburg: VIN 060438, Has HEAT, USA model
Tim Smith's 87: VIN 069457, Has HEAT, Canadian model
Erik O'Brien's 87 Syncro: VIN 071665, Has HEAT, USA model

It still looks as though that between #50426 and 60438 they
made a change to allow heat from these dash vents.
