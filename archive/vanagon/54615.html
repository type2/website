Same thing happened this weekend to my '82 Rabbit. Seems to be running
well now.  Time will tell...

Of course, I was driving to the airport when it happened, and after
paying for a pre-heat for the plane, I took off, and at 200 feet, the
airspeed indicator decided it was too cold to work.  (4 deg. F)

so
1- I froze my butt off driving to the airport (due to the &quot;Paul&quot; 
problem)

2- I Froze preflighting the plane

3- I flew for 10 minutes

4- I froze tying it down again.

5- Both mechanical things gave me problems

6- I shoulda stayed in bed.
