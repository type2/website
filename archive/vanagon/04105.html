Subject: Westy accessories &amp; misc.

Comments on several threads:

The heat blanket for the pop top canvas is an official westfalia part sold in
europe.

Westfalia also sells an official westy curtain that goes behind the front two
seats.

Anyone who wishes to accurately read the propane level in their propane tank
should instead kill themselves.

The idea to use the front table leg to route propane up a tube to a table leg
mounted heater is brilliant.

People who send messages on this list saying things like &quot;Right on Dan!&quot;
should be forced to read all messages on the internet before being allowed to
post again. Let's try to keep messages substantive. 
The best messages identify the people for whom it is appropriate clearly. A
message that has a subject &quot;1970s heater boxes&quot; tells water cooled vans not
to bother reading this unless they want to. This is a much better subject
heading than the simple &quot;heat.&quot; Also, it helps when people change the message
subject in the subject line as soon as they stray greatly from the subject
thread they started with.
