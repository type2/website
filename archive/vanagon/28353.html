Subject: Re: M codes


&gt;Mark's offer to coordinate web page efforts is magnanimous.
&gt;clara can be forgiven misplacing her Old Bus Review, she
&gt;*has* had more to think about (glad you're not hurt
&gt;seriously).  One of the contributors to the NEATO
&gt;compilation is subscribed to the VANAGON list, maybe he'll
&gt;respond to the cry.  Before the NEATO list of M-Codes, my
&gt;source was the VW Parts List for the Type 2 and it, too,
&gt;only had some of the codes, not all of them.

Doh, I guess that's me!  My sources for the M-codes were from
a Type II Parts list and a Volksworld article by Keith Sueme.
Mark if you email me direct I can send you the list of M-codes.
