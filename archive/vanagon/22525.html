Subject:      Re:  Hitch survey for '68-'71 bus



I have two types of hitches. One is a cross bar that replaces the rear bumper
and has a hitch on it, attaching to the bumper mounts. It reminds me of the
old &quot;loser jokes.&quot; A loser is a bus owner who trys to pull something with a
hitch attced to bumper mounts. I know--nuff said. The other came on the
campmobile. It attachs to the frame behind where the rear motor mount bar
attaches. Now that is a hitch. As to the bumber mounts, take a close look at
them, the are esentially welded on, belive me, I had occasion to have a mount
welded on--nuff said.
