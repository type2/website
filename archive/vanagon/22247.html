Subject: where are the fs vw's

Does noone on the net buy, sell, trade VW's or parts.
I've tried to subscribe to aircldvw; but it seems like I never
get any mail from there. Is there just no activity. I subscribed to
the same list a while back and it seemed I was getting an
overwheling amount of mail. Am I Cyberspaced. It all seems so different now.
Mike.
