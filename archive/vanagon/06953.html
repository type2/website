Subject: Gotta sneak this in!!!


Much as I know I'll be in trouble, I have to tell this :-) 

Last week, I drove my SO's 93 EV to the corner convenience store,
and noticed that the odometer said 23,850.  I told her that we would
probably like to get the EV checked out before the 24,000 mile warranty
was over, just to be sure.  She responded the standard : &quot;yeah, I know,
I'll do it whenever I can&quot; response.  In order to explain to her how
immediate the need was, I told her that this was so urgent that, by the time
she filled up her next tank of gas, it would be too late.

Sooo, guess what she tells me today as I'm about to leave home for
work???  She tells me that I need to call the dealer and make the
appointment for whatever needs to be done, 
because she is running out of gas!!!!!

What can I say???? Art historians should not be trusted with anything
but cracked paintings!!!!

BTW, Ric, what did you have the dealer check out when you had the EV
in for its final warranty checkup?



Cetin &quot;dead if SO finds out I sent this out to the group&quot; Seren
