Subject: Considering a 59 single cab purchase

I am considering purchasing a 59 single cab that is in reasonably good shape
and has a running origional engine and good tranny. Before I make my
decision I thought that I should ask some questions. I have a book that
covers T II back to 61, is the 59 similar enough or do I need a new book.
Are there any publications that would cover this year other than the idiot
manual (moment of silence please). Also what is the availability of parts
such as: master cylinder, brake drums, brake pads, etc., and who is a good
supplier.

Many thanks in advance!!
