&gt;I have an 84 Vanagon that needs the fuel vapor recovery lines replaced
&gt;(the ones that go from the top of the tank to the various overflow
&gt;cannisters.)  The damn things are hard (impossible?) to access.  It
&gt;appears to me that I will have to drop the fuel tank, can this be true?
&gt;If I go to that much trouble what else should I do while I've got it out?

check for rust on the top of the tank,
check the operation of those little anti-roll-over valve-thingies (that are
   supposed to keep gas from leaking out if you roll the bus or tilt it a
   lot).
and, yes, removing the tank is about the ONLY way you can get to those things.
i'm not looking forward to doing mine. i've already had to replace ALL the
fuel lines, and those suckers back over the transmission are a real pain.
