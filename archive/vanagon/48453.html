Subject:      Re: rear view mirror swap?

On Sat, 17 Aug 1996 22:32:12 -0500 you said:
&gt;a question. Do the electric side mirrors utilize the same mounting
&gt;holes on the door as the non-electric type (which is what I have)?  My

almost. i did the swap on my 88 bus, and while i LOVE the power mirrors,
it is VERY expensive. :(  you'll need to get the two mirrors (which come
pretty much complete ... except for the screws and connectors for the wires
and a little plastic cover for the bottom &quot;elbow&quot; of the mirror base) ...
and THREE wiring harnesses. the mirrors were about $200 EACH! :( so you want
to be VERY careful with them. the harnesses were about $90 EACH! :( :(
the three harnesses are: one for each door, and one to connect the other
two. one good thing is that the door harnesses have all the wiring for the
power windows and power door locks as well.

the &quot;almost&quot; part of the mirror mounting to the door is that the power
mirrors use the &quot;normal&quot; mirror mounting holes (two), but also require a
third hole lower down. i mounted the mirror and used the screw hole as a
guide to centerpunch for driling. the hardest part are the stupid nut that
fits onto that third screw: it has to be fitted up inside the door, and it's
hard to reach up there.  another &quot;problem&quot; is putting the wires for the
mirror throught the hole in the door (hmmm. i must have had to drill another
hole for them wires ... but i don't recall it). anyway, the wires have a
snap-together plastic connector, but the connector won't fit throught the
hole. so you have to remove the wires from the connector, put them through
the hole, and then put them back into the connector.

is it do-able? yup. once i got all the parts, it took me about a half day.
the longest time is used up in taking the door panels off and putting them
back on. oh, yeah: you'll need the switch for the left door panel. the panel
is pre-cut (behind the cloth) for the switch, so all you have to do is cut
the cloth, fold it back (i used a little headliner adhesive to help it stay
in place), and press the switch in.

is it expensive? yup. would i do it again? hmmmmmmmm. well, yeah, i guess.
if i had the money. one of the nicest things about having the power mirrors
is being able to adjust them at night to keep the high beams (of the idiot
behind you) out of your eyes. or the rising/setting sun as you drive west/
east at the wrong time of day.
