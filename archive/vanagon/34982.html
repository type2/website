Subject: ASI ? Conversion

Howdy,
I just finished looking at a very nice 72 with NO RUST! Body looked 
 great with just one minor ding in the drivers side rear corner panel.  
 I had almost given up my quest for a rust free camper. 
It was described over the phone as a westfalia but when I saw it I 
 realized that it was something else. I think that it may be an ASI 
 conversion, here is what it looks like:

Built on a sunroof bus chassis
Pop top is roughly the size of a westie but a little taller.
The top goes straight up, not like a westie that slopes up from the back
The interior is laid out like an early westie with a rear facing seat 
 behind the driver
No Fridge/Icebox Sink unit.
Fit and finish on the interior was very professional
White in color

Is this an ASI? Is ASI a good setup? Any Problems?

I am going to make a return trip with a compression gauge and if all is 
 well than I will more than likely buy it, and part out my present 
 project (78 westie &quot;Lima Bean&quot;) 

Thanks for any advice,
Clay
