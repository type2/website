&gt; ohyezzzz ... if they're arcing, you might be sparking, when you grab. ;)

They won't damage you for life... But they sure let you know what 40 000
Volts can make it's way through.  You should feel what happens when the
timing light I once borrowed from my dad does when the sparkplug end
comes unattached.  Thank god the engine died after a couple dozen
revolutions, 'cause I sure was too shocked (or stupid) to let go of
the thing.

&gt; but if you look on a dark and stormy night, you will see little blue
&gt; lightninganing on the wires.


A little of that &quot;lightninganing&quot; (great word) isn't bad.  If it just
creates a slight blue aura around the wires, it's probably not anything
to be concerned with.  If it looks like you've got a timing light going
when you don't... Then maybe it's time to replace the plugleads.
