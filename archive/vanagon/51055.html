       Well, it must have a better name, but I don't konw of it.
 
       If you would look at the back of the motor, (you can only
       see bits and pieces form the top and bottom) there is
       a steel plug, I think on the pass. side of the engine.
       I have no idea what it is for, but mine is leaking oil!
       My guess is, they (VW) needed access to something inside 
       the engine in manufacturing.
