 &gt; Can find no air passages to these vents.
 &gt; Yet air flows!
 &gt; Is it leaking through the window seals and door handles?

 That's the theory, I believe.  It just vents the air to the inside of the
 door and lets it go out drain holes, etc... &gt;&gt;
 

FYI: on the type II there are about four or five large covered &quot;holes&quot; in the
low pressure area on the back edge of the drivers door. Being in this low
pressure area, they are prone to a lot of vacuum and if you open those little
vents you will feel a lot more draw through the dash vents if all the other
windows are closed.
