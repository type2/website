&gt;  Just went browsing since this was suppose to be voted on on the 21st.
&gt;  This bill was to change the no smog date from pre 1966 models to &quot;any 25
&gt;  years or older&quot;  which would bring it up to about 1971-1972 years now,
&gt;  and it would slide forward.  Was sponsered by Senator Quentin Kopp.
&gt;  Looks like the vote was for it but don't know what the 're-referred to
&gt;  Com. on APPR' will do to it or the time frame.  Keep hoping.
&gt;
