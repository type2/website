&gt; This is a little poll on Vanagon mileage.  My newly-acquired '82,

&gt; alltime high of 11.5 mpg this last week, up from 10.5.  I've been using 87
&gt; octane gas. How are the rest of you doing in the mileage catetory?

	Geez... I get 15-17 mpg around town (southern NH) and as much as 
23 mpg Hiway and alot of that is mountains (VT/northern NH)...
