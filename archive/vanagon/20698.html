&gt;The way I see the removable apron:  
&gt;
&gt;1) 71's have a removable apron, as well as the 1600 and the down low
&gt;front 
&gt;turn signals.
&gt;
&gt;2) 72's have the T4 engine, with the down low front turn signals, but
&gt;the 
&gt;one which I see often does  _not_ have a removable apron.  The 72
&gt;also has 
&gt;the bigger air scoops and the different rear end (body wise).
&gt;
&gt;3) in 73 the turn signals moved up in the front and got more square
&gt;in 
&gt;shape.  I think that the rear has the previously mentioned bumper.
&gt;
&gt;I guess that what I am getting at is that the fixed rear apron is a 
&gt;consquence of the T4 engine, not the bumper.
&gt;
&gt;While we are here, how do you distinguish between the model years 68
&gt;to 71?  
&gt;The 71 has different hubcaps, but I don't know if these could be
&gt;retrofitted 
&gt;to the earlier years.  other than that, I can't tell a 68 from a 69
&gt;from a 70.


The only way I know of to tell the difference in the '68-'70 is the side
markers.  The '68 and I think '69 are round and behind the wheel in front.
 The '70 are square and at the front of the door.

On those front turn signals/parking lights, my '72 has the high square as on
a '73.  I also have the lip on the front fenders a la '73.  Could this be
because this is a late built (June 1972) Camper?

P.S.  The ID does start with 232 so I know it is a '72
