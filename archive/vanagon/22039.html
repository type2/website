Subject: Re: Tools &amp; Xenophobia

&gt;The rule of thumb is &quot; you get what you pay for&quot;
&gt;
&gt;1st corollary:  If you are lucky.
&gt;
&gt;If you want quality tools, they are gonna cost appropriately, doesn't matter
&gt;who makes them.

I've found that the desperately cheap foot-pumps (air) work well, within
the usual torture limits.  The first thing to go on mine is usually the
hose, although my old war-horse finally lost its check-valve.  I think I
paid $3.98 at K-Mart for these. (Watch out - some places sell the exact
same pump for over $20!)

I also keep several of those $4 socket sets around, but I've also got a set
of Craftsmen sockets now, cuz I was tired of the strange size distribution
in the last cheapo set that I bought (something like three identical 5/8&quot;
sockets and no 13mm).  I also have Snap-On tools for the things that I just
don't want to have to replace (torque-wrench, variable-advance timing
light, the custom-curved 13mm/14mm box-end wrench for the carburetor).

Had good luck with a 3-Ton floor jack from Sam's Club for $99. (special sale)

Sounds like another thing we can do for each other on the list -
information about good tools (from wherever) and good tool prices.

I AM NOT VOLUNTEERING TO MAINTAIN THE RECORDS. :-)
