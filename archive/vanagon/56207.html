&gt; A rotten egg smell is caused by sulfur dioxide in the exhaust gases being
&gt; reduced to hydrogen sulfide by the catalytic converter.  Some gasoline
&gt; contains traces of sulfur, hence the smell.  Not to worry-it just means
&gt; your catalytic converter is working well.

Hmmm, a few people have suggested this, but afaik I don't have a cat
converter (being in the UK).
If it is exhaust gases coming into the front of the car I should get it
looked into. It has not happened today even after more than an hour in slow
traffic. So it only seems to come when the car is moving fast.
