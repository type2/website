Subject:       ratty idle, part 1

... and from THE ARCHIVES (hint, hint)
&gt; Subject:       VW Ignition Arc-Over
&gt; 
&gt; Import Service, Nov/Dec '87 Vol 1, No 1
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Any model VW equipped with metal-shielded spark plug wires and/or
&gt; distributor caps may develop a rough idle or a part-throttle misfire.
&gt;  These problem can be caused by secondary ignition voltage arcing
&gt; over to these metallic shields.
&gt; 
&gt; To inspect the distributor cap properly, you must remove the shield
&gt; [and in Dan's opinion, leave it off].  Check the wires and cap for
&gt; small white spots.  The spots indicate that voltage is leaking to the
&gt; metallic shields.  Replace any caps or wires that show signs of
&gt; arc-over.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Dan's Note:
&gt; also look for BLACK spots on the plug wires.  the resistance may be
&gt; fine but a burn-thru in the insulation may still be present.  remove
&gt; that metal shield on the dist cap and throw it away.  clean the
&gt; exterior of the cap good and keep it clean.  brush and floss daily.
