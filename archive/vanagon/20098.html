Subject: EeziBleed for changing brake fluid

FYI from the Mazda list:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;...To change the fluid,
&gt; &gt; &gt;you have to try pretty hard to get all the old fluid out. This is way
&gt; &gt; &gt;easier if you use an EZBleed, just hook it up with no fluid, crack the
&gt; &gt; &gt;bleeder, and wait until air comes out. ...
&gt; &gt; Is EZBleed a kit that has a component which fits on to your master cylinder
&gt; &gt; and drives the fluid out with compressed air?  I have a friend in England
&gt; &gt; who has one of these but I haven't been able to find one in the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish to appologize to the list for being terminally confused. I have
&gt; just been told that there are two products on the market which sound
&gt; the same but are quite different. One, called EZBleed, is a one-way valve
&gt; that you put on the bleed valve dso you can pump the brakes yourself.
&gt; That's NOT what I have, and it isn't what I was talking about. The other
&gt; product, Gunson's EeziBleed, IS what I have, and it is a great device that
&gt; I am very pleased with. Sorry about any cnosiufno I've caused. EeziBleed
&gt; is a sizeable reservoir that you fill with brake fluid, and hoses and
&gt; couplings. You attach one hose to a tire inflated to about 15psi, and
&gt; the other to a master-cylinder-reservoir cap that fits your car's reservoir.
&gt; The result is that the brake system is pressurized, and fresh fluid runs in
&gt; as you go around to each wheel, opening the bleed valve, waiting for the
&gt; air to stop coming out, and closing the valve.
&gt; 
&gt; I got my EeziBleed from The Roadster Factory, but I have just learned
&gt; that there is a user eezibleed_at_aol_dot_com who may have a better deal
&gt; to offer... TRF is at 800-234-1104.
