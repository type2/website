Subject: gremlins in ignition

Here is some info on my 80 vanagon ignition gremlin:
 1) CA emisson controls so it has a halls control unit

 2) It seems to die(ha ha) when I'm crusing at a lower rpm(I don't know the
rpms cause no tach), it doesn't happen when I'm excelerating(sp?)

 3) It seems to run fine for approx. 20-30 minutes. then the little buggers
start #_at_$%*&amp;^ing with the ignition....so it seems to heat related.

It used to restart after a few minutes but it has gotten so bad that it is
starting. once again thanks for any and all suggestions...Rudy B. Santa
Rosa, CA
