Subject: Putting a rotary in a Vanagon

Has anyone put, or heard of anyone putting a Mazda rotary engine in a Vanagon?
Was there any modification neccessary to the deck lid? How about the
cooling system? Does the stock tranny work well w/ it? Kennedy has a kit,
I'm waiting on info from them. If anyone has ideas, let me know.
