Subject: Dictionary terms

&gt; BUS         1. any Volkswagen Transporter of any model and any year.
&gt;             2. specifically those VW transporters from 1968 to 1979,
&gt;             distinquished by a large one-piece windshield and rounded
&gt;             body contours. all had 'swing-axles'. also called T2
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Whoa, now -- aren't swing axles the ones that have spades on the inner 
end, while the outer end swings up and down?  Don't you mean IRS?

Gawd, I hope I'm right, or I'm gonna have to go apoly-jize to the idjit 
at the FLAPS (&quot;All VWs after 1967 had swing-axles, sir&quot; ((&quot;sir&quot; + 
tone of voice = &quot;you dipshit&quot;))).

And I also agree with the person who said they un-preferred &quot;split&quot; as 
the term for a pre-68, tho' &quot;splitty&quot; sounds ok.  I'd prefer 
&quot;split-windshield&quot; or the nicely Brit-sounding &quot;split-screen&quot;.

Joe (who never quite got over the Anglicized spellings in Haynes)

Joe Clark                                          Where there's no sense,
joeclark_at_freenet.scri.fsu_dot_edu                          there's no feeling.
