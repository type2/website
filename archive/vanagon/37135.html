Subject: Re: Craftsman tools (was: Spring clip pliers)


&gt;&gt; I've broken three Craftsman screwdrivers-- guess trying to lift an
&gt;&gt; entire bus with one, just isn't a good idea. Replaced free each time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, when my open toolbox got rained on in Cape Cod, MA in 1987, all
&gt;&gt; the tools rusted... except the Craftsmans.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; They're OK in my book.
&gt;
&gt;Mine too, though I keep them in the toolbox anyway 8^).  I've broken a few
&gt;craftsmans in my time, including two 1/2&quot; drive &quot;breaker bars&quot; (at least
&gt;that's what my dad and I always called them, though I forget the official
&gt;name) trying to remove splittie rear axle nuts with the proverbial &quot;cheater
&gt;pipe&quot; (the handle from my floor jack).  The second of these was brand new
&gt;when I broke it.  Still had the price sticker on it, and they STILL gave me
&gt;a new one

OTOH, I have *never* broken a Craftsman wrench, or even seriously dinged
one up, despite becoming emotionally involved with the project a few times.
This is even when I hastily used my 13mm instead of the 1/2&quot; I should have
used, etc.

As for bus axle nuts, I once did break another brand 1/2&quot; swivel-head bar
(&quot;breaker bar&quot;) on one, using the aforementioned cheater pipe. So I
finally got wise too, and went to a welding shop where they took a 5-foot
long 2&quot; mild steel pipe, and SOLIDLY welded a 3/4&quot; impact-drive at right
angles, to the end. That, with a 1-13/16&quot; socket, makes a great &quot;nut
persuader&quot;. Works well on low-lying nuclear missiles, too.   :^)

I've heard that Snap-on tools are even better (wrenches have narrower
heads, able to fit into tighter spots, but just as strong) than Craftsman.
But I've never bought any, 'cuz they're fantastically expensive. If I were
a professional mechanic, they might be worth it. But for the amount of
work I do on cars etc., Craftsman are great. (For the amount of *expertise*
I have, K-mart blue-light specials are more than enough).

IMHO there are two kinds of expensive lifetime-guarantee tools. One kind
is where they have put fantastic amounts of R&amp;D into the design, used
long, slow, expensive heat-treating and alloys, and made a tool that
absolutely, positively never breaks. The other kind is where you are
simply paying in advance for the next three or four replacements (like
those triple-edge wiper blades for $19.95 + $10 S&amp;H you see on late night
TV commercials), after which they figure you'll give up and go away in
disgust, thus ensuring they retain their profit.

Peace and love, y'all...
