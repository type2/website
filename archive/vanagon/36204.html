Subject: Re: Digifant - $100 Harness

&gt;signal that must not oscillate. The easiest way is to add a $0.5 25 V  10 uF
&gt;tantal capacitor  with its +side  connected to pin 4 and its common to pin 2
&gt;(who is the air flow voltage output) to stabilise the voltage.  Later  Boch

OK I found the original Limbo article/posting for this fix.

NOTE:  it says to use  #2 as positive, #4 as negative !!!  I used it this way.
Any electrical geeks wanna tell if it makes a diff in this application? Prolly.

If anyone wants a copy pls. mail direct and I'll forward.
