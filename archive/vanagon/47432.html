Subject: Re: Alternative alternators? / Vanagon Budget Stereo FAQ

&gt; &gt;I've an '83 diesel Westie into which a new audio system will soon be 
&gt; &gt;installed.  My new technical advisor for this formerly owned an auto 
&gt; &gt;audio shop and won some Florida audio championship for three years with 
&gt; &gt;his promotional van that was featured in several magazines.  Even for a 
&gt; &gt;modest high accuracy system, he insists the Westie must have at least a 
&gt; &gt;65 amp alternator.  I installed an inverter, and for recharging a second 
&gt; &gt;battery, I wanted to increase charging capacity anyway.
&gt; &gt;  So what applicable more powerful alternators are available?  I suspect 
&gt; &gt;a few gaser owners would also like to know what alternatives fit their 
&gt; &gt;Vanagons or EVs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I'm not committed to going forward with his plans yet, but I have 
&gt; &gt;agreed to pay for a system design.  If and only if there's interest in 
&gt; &gt;the key elements he specifies, I'll post that information on the list.  
&gt; &gt;I've been told installation/design is at least as important in 
&gt; &gt;determining final sound as component selection.  
&gt; &gt;  Thanks ahead for any good alternator upgrade leads.
