Heyro!

  I hope nobody takes this as an ad. It's not intended to be anything
more than letting everybody know about a decent newsletter with some
good aircooled info.
  Cool newsletter I've come across called the Westfalia Campbox News.
Currently it deals mainly with split window Westfalias only but
talking to Todd (the editor), he's going to open it up to all air
cooled Westies soon. It's cheap $6.00 a year. Technical stuff as well
as the rare. The circulation is still small enough that Todd responds
to everybody personally. HE IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR ARTICLE SUBMISSIONS!
  He'll send you a copy for free (he appreciates a stamp but it's not
required. I can't imagine the six bucks even covering his postage.
  Anyway, I'm not currently involved with the newsletter other than
Todd being a friend. He has asked me to produce an electronic edition
which I guess I'm going to do. Some of you may recognize his name and
those that do will know him to be good vdub people. Anyway, his
address is listed below.

Westfalia Campbox News
Todd Swangstu
1728 Evansdale
Toledo, OH  43607

Like I mentioned, he'll send out a copy for free. If you can send a
stamp, he'll appreciate it. If you don't wanna do the stamp thing,
email me and I'll pass along your address (he's not on the net.)
Email me at
        gbert_at_write_dot_com
There's no current date yet set for the electronic edition. I still
have to send in the registration fee for the shareware I'll likely be
using, make up a few sample copies, etc. so who knows. Anyway, no list
will be maintained for those who desire the electronic edition.

Any other questions, email me or snail mail Todd.

If you have any good articles, stories (treasure hunts etc.), let
either of us know. Submission guidelines are slim. If you want them
then again email or snail. Best thing to do is just send the stuff in.
If there's room and it's interesting, Todd will print it.

Putting aside the newsletter, if anybody needs to know anything about
pretty much any Westie, Todd's a very good person to ask. He's very
knowledgeable and what he doesn't know, he can find out.

Hope this helps,
Lates,
Greg
