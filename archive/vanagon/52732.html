Subject: VWoA's Web site

Hi Volks,
 I was just wondering if anyone has had trouble getting on the VWoA's Web
site. My computer links up to the site but I get a blank page.   I'm
wondering if my brower is so old that I cannot get whats on the site. (its
a really old version of Netscape)   Anyway, if its me only having trouble
then I guess I'll have to live with it until I get an update of netscape.
Anyone have 2.0 they could mail me.  I cannot run 3.0, I've tried.
Actually, its time for a hardware update. But thats another story.   Take
care.
