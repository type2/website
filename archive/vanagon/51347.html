Subject: FOR SALE: '90 Syncro Westy in NC

'Happy upgrade' forces sale of the following:
          Flash Metallic Silver 1990 Syncro Westfalia
          in Asheville, NC (a great place to visit upon purchase!):

Well, there is an incredibly long story behind this &quot;For Sale&quot; sign...
...but due to an increasingly busy/mobile life, I'll have to save the fun
story for those serious buyers who care to inquire/see it... ;-) Tho
quietly lurking reading digests for a while, I've appreciated all the ongoing
dialogue -- thanks to all who have/take the time.

My vehicle has hi miles (132k) but you'd never know it from the way it looks
&amp; drives. Primarily a 1-owner vehicle, and a CT show winner this summer, it
has been all around the world -- mostly h'way miles -- meticulously
maintained with all papers. Rebuilt engine at 126k, and new transmission
(a.k.a., that expensive viscous coupling got replaced) at 84k so it drives
smooth and strong. Full power pkg including: PS, PB, PW, PL, Cruise Control,
Viper alarm, Alpine remvbl cassette, very clean in &amp; out. Tires have about
34k, but comes with 2 add'l unused Michelin MXL's. Recent new battery,
starter, windshield, heater core as well. Asking $19k. Minimally negotiable
for a quicker sale.

Will consider driving it to your destination, tho prefer to make local travel
arrangements easier for a long distance buyer -- ie, airport pickup and free
lodging in urban or mountain setting! Hey, why not have fun while buying your
dream vehicle? :)

email, or call 704-232-1311 for more details.
thanks,
Jonah
