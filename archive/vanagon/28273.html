&gt;&gt;I have seen this Gopher site and it *is* very helpful to
&gt;&gt;most of the splittie group.  Your problem with the Kombi is
&gt;&gt;the same problem I have with 3 1967s.  VW changed the Model
&gt;&gt;Codes in 1966 when they went to the 9-digit chassis number.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have been entering Old Bus Registry forms for NEATO and
&gt;&gt;have seen all sorts of model numbers show up for 1966 and
&gt;&gt;1967.  Most numerous are:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;22-15 Microbus
&gt;&gt;23-42 Westy Camper   &lt;--- Aha!
&gt;&gt;23-11 Kombi
&gt;&gt;24-12 Deluxe
&gt;&gt;24-13 Deluxe
&gt;&gt;26-16 Double Cab
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I suspect that if you look at your ID tag you will see 2311
&gt;&gt;behind the seat and 23-11 on the air vent, though I have
&gt;&gt;found that the 66s may only have Type 23 on the vent ID.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Once I get through all of these forms, I hope to compile a
&gt;&gt;list to add to the list you forwarded.

Hmmmm.  My air vent tag says Typ 23-42 and my behind-the-seat-plate has a
model of 2312.  Does this mean that my bus was built as a Wanna-be-Westy???
The PO says it was a camper but the sink and other goodies were yanked out
along the way.  It does have jalousie windows, cabinets, table,
fold-down-into-a-bed rear seat---hey, wait a minute! I thought all Westy
campers had pop-tops.  Apparently not!  Joel, change the stats!

Ok, anybody have a sink/stove/fridge for a '67 camper?

Bob.
