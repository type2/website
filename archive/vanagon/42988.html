Subject: First trip success! (almost)

Hey all, 
 My wife and I took are first trip of the year in the RADHAUS.  It was 
great.  I'm finding the speed factor in the 83 diesel vanagon bearable.  
I have developed a calm attitude towards those drivers that used to drive 
me crazy, you know the ones that go way to slow!  Well, I have been going 
to mountain bike races for months now, but the van showed how nice and 
functional it could be while at Assateaque National Seashore.  We set up 
the canvas room and popped the top.  Perfect!  We got a lot of looks 
too!  The only problem was the dead battery when we wanted to leave.  I 
was listening to the radio and cd player and not recharging the battery.  
Here comes the begging part.  Does anyone have a gauge in their van to 
let them know when they have been draining the cells too long?  Since my 
battery is in the back, is there a way to put another battery in that bay 
and have it charged via the alternater?  Just wondering??!!?
