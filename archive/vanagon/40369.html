&gt; PLEASE!!! remember to bring some wood with you.  There isn't

&gt; bundle or two now and not when you're driving down.  Please 
&gt; remember to do this one thing because it's awful cold at night
&gt; in the desert!  

I mailed the members that looked like they were in the Bayarea to offer
some of my wood.  So now is a general offer, anyone in the bayarea that is
going to Red Rock can come to my house and get some wood.  I don't want
anyone to pull a Schwarze, and bring only one little piece of wood.
