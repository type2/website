Subject: Re: hubcaps (wheel covers)

Speaking of HubCaps:

I have a set of 4 from my '91 Westy that are in excellent condition. I am
interested in selling these, preferably as a set. I need to recoup a little
from the cost of the 4 factory Alloys I replaced the steel wheels with.

In addition, I have 5 steel wheels with the Michelin MX? (whatever the orig
were) 205/70 R14 reinforced tires for sale. These are quite heavy so a nearby
buyer (to MA) would be easier. 4 Tires have 28K miles on them. The spare is
&quot;new&quot; with no mileage on it.

Let me know if you are interested.

Kenyon

&gt; anybody know anything about these folks:
&gt; 
&gt; Hubcaps               they have a web site:
&gt; 822 Clinton Street
&gt; Buffalo, NY 14210     http://www.hub-caps_dot_com/VW.html
&gt; (716) 856-6923
&gt;                       which has a bunch of different vw hubcaps. of interest
&gt; to this bunch would be the ones for Eurovans and Vanagons ... both of which
&gt; have a price of &quot;Inquire&quot;. :)  can anybody in/near Buffalo call and see how
&gt; much they want for one?? the picture in the web page (click on the part
&gt; number) appears to be the right one (for vanagon, anyway)
