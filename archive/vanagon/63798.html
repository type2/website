Motor mounts are easy to inspect.  Maker sure they are not separating.  I 
doubt that they are the cause of your problem.

Hi Listees,

(Good to see mail again eh, take the time to give the admin a big
hand........)

I was wondering if anyone has had problems with the engine mounts on the
2.1L engine? (86 westy, standard)

I was told(by my mechanic) that the front mount(transmission) was shot and
that was causing the engine to shutter when you let the clutch out, this in
turn has caused exhaust pipe problems at the connection to the rear pipe
i.e.. front pipe broke at &quot;y&quot; connection, rear pipe still ok.

I have always found the clutch touchy, and hard to let out for a smooth
take off, but no matter how you let the clutch out you rattle the
passengers dentures, to a point of falling out I might add!

any suggestions?, how can you check to see if the motor mounts are good?
am I getting the run around on the front mount being bad?
does my clutch just suck?

Thanks,

Tony Mysyk
