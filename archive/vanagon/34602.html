Subject: Re: Placement of stickers

I hate to revive the old VWT&amp;A thread here...but howabout we send
4 of the stickers to VWT&amp;A along with some string and then they
can place the stickers on their &quot;bimbos&quot; and attach everything together with 
the string thereby making a &quot;Vanagon_at_lenti&quot; string bikini!!

Just a thought....
(with my mind in the gutter)
