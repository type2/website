Subject: Re: Someone was looking for Ghia convertables?


	Someone, from the UK I think, was asking after Ghia drop tops.
A look at the San Jose Mercury News (eg Murky News) revealed:

76 Ghia Conv. New 1776 chrm rims $2000 (408) 356 4308
VW '72 Ghia, red Convert. Like New New eng &amp; inter. $6900  408 662 3619

	Ohhh 2K for a convertable with chrome rims! Fortunately, my
Corrado has a sunroof...
