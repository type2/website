Hello,

&gt;From my own personal archive I'll add the following commentary.  Your
milage will vary ...

Dick

&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry, I know we just had a thread on bus tires and I hate to bring
&gt; this up again, so if someone could refer me to some archive with the
&gt; pertinent info, I would be very appreciative. 

&gt; 
&gt; Now, this is the info I got from a local tire shop: the best for the bus
&gt; would be a 185/SR14 Michelin XZX Reinforced ($85) and the second best

I've used these on three Vanagons and been completely satisfied.  I'm in
New England and need the &quot;all weather&quot; variety.

&gt; would be a 205/70R14 Michelin MXL Reinforced ($105) which has the
&gt; disadvantage that it is not an all-season. 

I went to the NTW store in our areas and was told these were no longer
available in the reinforced style.  Did they tell me wrong ??

They should be reinforced
&gt; because of sway. (Reinforced Continentals would be the 3rd solution, but
&gt; they don't carry them).

If you like a hard ride with plenty of noise and road vibration in the summer
and are into the sport of &quot;Vanagon skiing&quot; down the highway in the winter,
then by all means buy Continentals.  If not, then ....

&gt; 
&gt; Would you all second that opinion? If you prefer not to bother the other
&gt; 190 people who paid better attention than I, then send me a direct reply
&gt; at dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
