Subject: Re: '71 Kombi camper $2500.00 What's so special?

&gt;There's an add in our local paper for a &quot;71 volkswagen camper.  I  
&gt;looked at it.  Body is very good, paint is hideous purple, interior  
&gt;so so, supposedly just overhauled engine, it's not a pop top.   
&gt;$2500.00  .  Vin #23122xxxxx.  That identifys it as a Kombi right?   
&gt;Is there some reason they fetch a higher price?

Yes there is.  They want something for nothing.  Time and time again I see
VW vans for sale at way too high prices.  We all love our Buses, but what
price do you put on sentiment? 

 If this add said, &quot;1971 Ford Van, body VG, interior fair, hideous purple,
recently rebuilt engine.  $2500,&quot;  what would you think?
