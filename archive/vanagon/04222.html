Subject: Phil Spector

I remember &quot;To Know Him Is To Love Him&quot;.  I have it on a tape made
by a fanatical friend who has all those old 45s.  I really love that
song.  I class it as one of the top 5 or so of all Doo Wop songs.

The song title &quot;To Know Him Is To Love Him&quot; came from the tombstone of 
Spector's father.

The female singer of the Teddy Bears was named Annette Kleinbard.  I say &quot;was&quot;
because she has changed her name to Carol Connors.  Under her new monicker,
she has had a successful career as a songwriter.  Mostly, I gather, she writes
movie themes.  She has been nominated for 4 Emmys, 2 Academy Awards, and 1
Grammy.  She wrote &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,&quot; which was a
hit for Vikki Carr (I believe) a couple of decades ago.
