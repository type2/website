Subject: Dressing Up a Vanagon

	Has anybody done any mild customizing to their Vanagons? I'm
looking for tasteful bolt-on dress up things like chin spoilers, ground
effects (do the fiberglas rockers from '88 on fit the older vans?) and
wheels. I've looked for cast wheels locally, and from the Tire Rack, but
the best I could do were older Mercedes replica wheels (uglier than my
current VW wheel covers) or the 5 spoke VW Weekender wheels (gorgeous, but
$500 cdn). Any bug meets I've attended have beautiful spltties &amp;
breadloafs displayed, but vanagons are just plain vanilla haulers in the
parking lot.
	Thanks for any info.
