Subject: Any Way to Filter Vanagon ATF on Autoboxer?

Volks,
I have posted this question before, but lost my system and all stored
e-mail. Is there any place to tap into the pressure side AFTER the
torque converter to grab a stream of ATF to send to a filter? Has anyone
ever installed a filter on the Autobox of a Vanagon? If so, how so? Any
and all feedback appreciated.
I will do this thing!
Regards
