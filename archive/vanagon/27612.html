Well, here they are... those of you who suggested names for those who seem
inordinately interested in &quot;the box the Bug came in&quot;, now get to see your
name in genuine print.

So if we adopt the Boxer name, and there's a revolution amongst VW Bus
drivers, would that be a Boxer Rebellion?


Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt; (old Boxhead)
hmmm. food for thought. especially since all the buses are shaped like
boxes. and the first three generations had a &quot;boxer&quot; engine (flat,
horizontally-opposed cylinders ... even Bill's Porsche engine fits. :)
maybe BoxKar?  Boxer?  Boxer-Shorts?  BoxKinder?
and, of course, if buses were considered &quot;light&quot;, as in made-of-aluminum,
why then we'd be   &quot;Boxites&quot;. :)  &lt;groan&gt;
but the 5-cylinder Eurovan's don't fit this convention ... but being bigger
than our little 4-cylinder boxers, maybe the EV's are just &quot;crates&quot;???  :) 
:)

Van-Dammed.
or, if we were all art collectors, we could be
Van Go        &lt;Van Goners????&gt;
didn't VW used to sell/give-away old style hats with &quot;Bus Driver&quot; on them??

Would the act of stealing a '69 VW van be considered
