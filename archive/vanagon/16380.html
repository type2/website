I saw a homemade one in a Ghia at last summer's Scarboro show.
It was a a plate of sheet metal with a VW logo stamped deeply into it
then Chromed, looked very nice, but I don't know where you could get
it stamped.  Does anyone here have a hydraulic press and a VW logo
stamp?  You could make a bit of $$$ I bet.
