Subject: Re: Need help with my '87 propane charge valve

&gt;Perhaps, I just don't know how use the propane fill valve on the '87 syncro I
&gt;just bought.
&gt;I've had 10 filling stations attempt to charge my tank to no avail. The
&gt;propane just won't
&gt;go in.

It won't go in because the bleeder valve isn't open.  It must be open all
the way, and when the propane which is being shot into the tank starts to
come out the bleeder hole it's full.  Quickly tighten the valve again
(don't get frostbite from the gas, wear gloves!!) and you're done!!  If the
gas  blows out from the bleeder hole after you've tightened the
valve...you're gaskets are bad.  All your gas may leak out, BE CAREFUL NOT
TO IGNITE IT!!!! Unless you want it to become a flame thrower.  But this is
another story....
