&gt;... or are the joys of uniqueness, 
&gt;comaraderie (watercoolers don't wave to each other), 

Hah!  Next time you pass this way in a Transporter, with an 
engine between you and oncoming traffic, I'll wave.  All of us 
salute each other (sometimes) and when a venerable Bus/T2 
passes, we always stare and smile!

We don't acknowledge T3s (Vanagons).  I don't know why.

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
*** A friendly little '91 T4 with a smile.
