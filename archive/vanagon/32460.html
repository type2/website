Subject: emergency parts bag


Hello all,
What are recommended spares to carry around that are vw specific.  My 87 
syncro is pushing 135kmi and I'd like to put together an emergency kit so's 
my chances of being stranded are reduced.  some ideas i've had (with the 
help of previous browsing of the list) are:

starter relay (what other relays or electrical components should be incl.)
a section of coolant hose and some couplings
belts
coolant
????

Thanks,
Fred
