Hello All

Thanks everyone for the responses to my queustions.  I have just settled up the 
insurance company and am now looking more seriously for a newer Vanagon .


I looked at a 1987 Vanagon GL today. It was silver with some &quot;Z&quot; shaped pin 
strips. I recall seeing this before but then I dont remember seeing a
Vanagon GL before.  I really liked it though,,, AC power steering, power 
mirrors, locks, Aluminum wheels, Great body too!!  I asked if they would put on 
a lift for me to take alook underneath, so I could look for rust, coolant leaks 
and the like. Anything else I should look for????? OH yeah The seats were in a 
face to face configuration, this was really cool!!!


The dealer wants to get $6900. for this baby I thihk I can get him to lower the 
price a little. Is this a fair price??

Well I am back out on my search.....  OH this Vanagon has only 69,000 miles on 
it!!!!  Somehow this bothered me... I have not driven a vehicle with less than 
140,000 miles on it for more then 10 years.  All VW's too!!!  It seemed odd to 
sit in the cockpit of a vehicle with that few miles.
