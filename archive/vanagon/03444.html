&gt;Thom, didn't your mom ever tell you not to live in south Sac.?   :-)

I don't live in South Sac!  I live almost in Carmichael!  Thats how bad
this area is getting!

S Sac is getting to be like South Central, with people getting dragged out 
of their cars and shot in broad daylight - for the rims!  (tru story!)
