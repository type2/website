Hi Bill!

I have had the same fantasy about a porsche powered VW van since I saw 
that same article in Hot VWs.  For me it is still a fantasy but would you 
consider posting your experiences?  If I ever get around to doing it, I'd 
want to do most of the work myself too.  I'd also be interested in 
knowing how much it cost.

               Thanks, 

                    Martin.
