..I've done this in a bug- after drilling, blow out the cylinder, and then
use a piece of tubing attached to vacuum cleaner to suck up any shavings
(which are a lot softer metal that the cylinder walls/rings).

This would work, but a word of CAUTION is recommended.  Make sure that the 
fuel (as in Gas) supply is disconnected and the intake valve is closed. 
 Otherwise, gas fumes can be inhaled into the vacuum cleaner, then into the 
electric motor and...BOOOOOM!  Your in orbit.

Just a note.......thankfully, not from experience.
