Subject: Re: A/C Blowing gunk

I wonder if the gunk is the weather stripping from the face plate of the
airconditioner.  My AC is in a Westy and when I was replacing speaker
wires the weatherstripping on the AC vents shreadded all over the place.
I cleaned it up and replaced the weatherstripping and all is well.
