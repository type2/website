Subject: TGIF: Bussed (song parody)

Hey, everyone! Here's this week's TGIF Song Parody. It's not as good as the
previous two offerings since I've got a calculus test at 8AM tomorrow. I
apologize. The next one will be better. However, this was a quick write
because it's from my heart. Enjoy it, please.

Ron, when you put this on vanagon_dot_com, snip out this stuff (above the line). 

Note that the original lyrics (from the Illustrated EJ Discography) are at:

To the Elton fans in the audience: it's a great site!

Bussed
by Jennifer Sarantites

Music by Elton John
Original Lyrics by Bernie Taupin

Available on the album &quot;Made In England&quot; (Rocket, 1995)

Hey you, I see a bus in my head
It hasn't been bought yet
Its gas tank has yet to be fed
But I swear, it'll be blessed

I know I've still got that dream
It just might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway, it'll be blessed

(refrain):
And I still love that bus
I want the best
A Westy at that
I'll make it a web page
Pull its name from a hat
I promise you that
Promise me that
Promise it that
It'll be blessed

I can feel the call of the road
&quot;Hey, Go just to go&quot;
To learn things that I didn't know
And know it's my bus

(repeat refrain, 2x)
(instrumental)

It'll be blessed ...

(long instrumental)

It'll be blessed ...

(etc. Repeat for a while, then ...)

(fade)
