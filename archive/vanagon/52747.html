Terry,

I wouldn't think that shipping panels would be a problem. As they are flat,
they should fit within UPS (preferred) and Greyhound's limitations. The big
problem for me was the seats.

Yes I did try RPS (Roadway Package Service), but their size limitations
were similar to UPS. You may want to try Fed-Ex too. They have a 3-day
select that was reasonable $$$ and their size limitations are much more
forgiving than UPS and RPS.

Ahhhhh!! Too many acronyms!!!

Good luck,

tony

&gt; Did you check with Roadway Package Service the sister company
&gt; of Roadway Trucking. I located an interior (panels only) in Ca. but
&gt; same problem. If you come up with anything please pass it on as 
&gt; I would like to still get the panels.
