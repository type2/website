Subject: VWs and Drive-ins


Way back when in sixty-seven....oops wrong date...good song, tho...

Actually back in the early 70's we had THREE drive-ins all within 15 =
miles of eachother...one only 4 miles from my house. Of course most =
every Saturday night I'd be at one of them either on a date, or a double =
date, or just hanging out with a group of friends.

Here's a few choice memories:

Did you know that with an appropriate blanket, one could park a Karmann =
Ghia backwards into a spot at the drive-in, fold down the back seat, =
fold the backs of the front seats forward, use the blanket as a cushion =
over the ridge on the back seat. And then crawl into the back seat area, =
put your feet in the luggage compartment and rest your back against the =
backs of the front seat while looking at the move thru the rear window. =
.... and yes it IS possible to make love in the back of a Karman Ghia =
(just have to change positions slightly from the movie watching =
position)...


We once found a couch by the side of the road (awaiting pick-up by the =
trash collectors) while driving my 62 Typ2 Pick-up. So we tossed it in =
the back of the pick-up, where it stayed for the summer. We did the =
drive in a bunch of times with the pick-up....three in the cab, and =
about 5 or so sitting on the couch or on the floor of the p/u bed. Once =
at the drive in, we would take out the couch, put it in front of the P/U =
and enjoy the movie.


In 1974 we saw &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; in my 67 camper....

Also in 1974 we got thrown out of the Fairhaven Drive-in by the security =
guard...
Four of us (on a double date) were in my, then, brand new Thing...top =
down,doors off, and windshield lying flat. The officer took offense to =
the line of beer cans sitting on the windshield.....


Ahhh, those were the days.....young, carefree...and somewhat stup...oops =
reckless....
