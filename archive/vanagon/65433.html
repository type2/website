Subject:      Question on TDI

Hello


I have a friend that wants to buy a [multivan] All Star and he has some
doubts.

        - The Tdi motor does 2,500 of [vw] be good?
        - do you Know if  have been detected shortcomings in this motor?
        - Which it is better TDI option or VR6

Thank you for your comment.
