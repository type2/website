Subject: New Van List Home, PLEASE READ !


Here is an update on the vanagon list.

It is going to remain a ListServ group, vanagon.

It will be hosted from the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). For
those of you unfamiliar with SDSC, it is one of four national (that is
federally supported) centers for computational science and engineering. 
A sister center, NCSA, developed the Mosaic web broswer several years
back. 

SDSC will provide our internet connection, but the group will need
to purchase a server (computer) and ListServ software. This will provide
us with a lot of management flexibility,  and potential to do
some interesting things later on. We are also working on acquiring a
donated machine. If this works out, funds will be used to purchase
parts necessary to update this machine (hardware/OS), and of course the
proper version of the ListServ software.

So here's how it's supposed to work:

Ron Lussier will collect funds and order our server/software.

The server/software will sent to Chris Smith at SDSC for
installation and configuration.

The group will subsequently be managed by Ron Lussier (LikeMinds) and
Chris Smith (SDSC).

We're asking for donations of $3-5, though larger donations are welcome.
If we receive more than the required amount of money, the extra funds will
be spent on memory and disk space.

Please send vanagon funds, c/o Ron Lussier at:

     Vanagon
     c/o Ron Lussier
     10164 Parkwood Drive #8
     Cupertino, CA  95014-1533
     USA

We realize that our members outside the U.S. of A. are very willing to
contribute to this effort.  (We've gotten dozens of offers from across the
various ponds!)  Unfortunately, the hassle of managing foreign funds makes
this impractical.  Thanks anyhow!

Ron, Chris, &amp; Gerry
