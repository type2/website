Subject: Re: HELP: clutch/pilot bearing update

Darie--

Saw your most recent clutch note---I have an 86 GL and have not had the
misfortune of clutch problems yet.  However I have replaced the clutch
(twice) on an 86 Nissan Pulsar and can patch that experience together with
my Bentley 86 Vanagon diagrams.  

This is probably too late....but it looks to me that your job would go a lot
easier if you removed the transmission housing first rather than trying to
work through a small opening as you describe...in fact my Bentley manual p
30.4 says you have to.  I have tried to cut corners on Bentley several times
(on other jobs) and not gotten away with it.  If I got things apart, I could
not get them back together.  My Nissan experience (of course there is less
room in a transverse mounted engine compartment than the Vanagaon ) is that
you have to be able to get to the entire clutch assembly to clean it up and
put it back together right.  Another &quot;advantage&quot; of removing the
transmission housing is that you can look at a lot of other parts [clutch
disc, pressure plate, flywheel, starter gear and seals to see if they are
about to go].  Having gone this far, it would be a good idea to replace
anything else on the verge of failure...and you ought to clean it up.  Your
reference to &quot;oil and stuff&quot; makes me think a seal has gone.  This may save
you from having to redo the entire job a short itme in the future. 

I have taken the CV joints and axles off my 86.  They are held on by 6 point
socket head bolts (8mm I think). I bought a 6 point socket that snaps on the
end of a ratchet (tried the allen wrench and vice grip approach with the 78
van I had before and managed to round several off).  They came off fairly
easily with the socket.  Be certain the socket heads are thoroughly cleaned
out first....and maybe you want to tap the socket insert in to get it tight.
If the bolts are rusted, some penetrating oil should help.  I have not
needed to use heat, and would only do so as a last resort.  I did get the
messed up bolt off the 78 with a vice grip on the outside of the
head...guess the next option was to saw the socket head off with a hacksaw
but I didn't go that far.

You need to be certain to torque the CV bolts correctly when you put it back
together [33 ft lbs in my Bentley---I would clean and regrease the CV joints
as well while they are out].  I thought I had the CV bolts tight enough on
my 78 with an allen wrench turned by a vice grip; but they weren't and
worked loose about 3 months later on a vacation stranding me with a very
unhappy wife and four small children.  I still hear about it a dozen years
later.

I know this sounds like I'm adding a lot of work to your list.  I think
you'll come out ahead in the long run though.  Good luck
