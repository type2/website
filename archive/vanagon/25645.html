Subject: 1800 into Vanagon?
Date: Wed, 27 Sep 95 17:48:31 PDT

 This message is for the fellow in Florida who has agreed to help install
 an 1800 longblock into a Vanagon. I apologize for posting to the list, but
 I deleted the message before realizing that this swap has problems 
 associated with it . 

 Here's the rub. The Vanagon exhaust system won't fit the 1800 unless that
 long block was built with &quot;Vanagon&quot; heads aka &quot;square port heads&quot;. They 
 aren't really &quot;vanagon heads&quot; since they are shared with the '79 bus, but
 that doesn't seem to stop people from calling them that. Anyway, a stock
 1800 longblock is going to come with round port heads which use an 
 entirely different exhaust port sealing scheme &lt;a copper ring instead of
 a flat gasket&gt;. 

 Installing an exhaust systmem off an earlier bus isn't a very good alternative
 either since the early heat exchangers get air from the fan housing as well
 as the aux. fan and the vanagon heat exchangers get air only from the 
 plastic fan mounted to the alternator.

 Using the fan housing off an earlier bus won't work out because the alternator
 is in a different spot and may be covered by the vanagon's sheet metal.

 Whew! Who said all those type IV motors were alike??
