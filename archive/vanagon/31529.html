Vanatics,

The Edmunds guide seemds to match my window sticker pretty well, but the
basic price of the van is different.  I suspect this might be due to mid-year
price changes, since I bought my van late in 1988.  If anyone has any
additional or clarifying information. I'd love to hear from you.  BTW, WLE is
Wolfsburg Limited Edition.

Thanks,
Jim Davis

88 Wolfsburg
