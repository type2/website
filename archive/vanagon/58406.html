Hi volks,

Having just traded in a black Mazda MPV minivan on my medium slate blue '87
Westi, I have to agree strongly with the concern expressed about turning a
vanagon into an *oven* by painting it black.  I bought the Mazda at the end
of the model year, and actually used the color as one of the negative
features in trying to haggle the price down!  And there were times, in the
next 7 summers in Sacramento, that I regretted my decision.

However---when chris says,

&gt;I agree!!   You gotta figure VW had some good reason for never painting ANY
&gt;of their buses or Vans black.... (aside from looking ugly....JMO...)
&gt;

I have to wonder about VW having &quot;some good reason&quot; for a color decision.
After all, over the years, VW has chosen to paint buses more ugly colors
than I would even have guessed could be found; especially, more sorry shades
of brown......

YMMV,

Gail  8^}

&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt;Well I am currently considering painting my 85 Black and replace the gray
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;stripe with a gold one.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a warning.  This might look nice, but your van will bake in the
&gt; summer.  You might consider painting the top white at a minimum. &gt;&gt;
