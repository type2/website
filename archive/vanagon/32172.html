Subject: Re: Using some list post in Limbo newsletter

Hi all,

On the net people are very used to the fact that information is gathered
and clipped and quoted and that's just the way it goes.  I feel, and I'm
sure a lot of people agree with me (or perhaps not) that there's an
unwritten rule that what's on the net is what's on the net, but that's
where it stays...

I feel at the very least LiMBO should ask permission to reprint the
author's articles.  Posters to newsgroups and newsletters do so with an
understanding that their material may be copied, quoted, or questioned
within the boundaries of the internet,  but not neccessarily _reprinted_ in
a circulating publication without thier permission.


I would agree with Derek Drew in that if you have any stories or
suggestions or information that you post anywhere and you don't want them
reprinted, simply state &quot;for list only&quot; or put a permission request for
reprint in your signature file.  This may sound silly, but one day who
knows...all of your helpful information could end up in a top selling
how-to book and there's nothing you will be able to do about it...

Regards,

John(ny) Smythe

PS  This is in no way meant to put down LiMBOs suggestion, I think it's a
great idea!
