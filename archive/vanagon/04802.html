hey, i did MY part ... wrote a whole pome about driving buses in the winter.
:)  must be a hard work Friday.

i'm semi-working on another one, but if someone else wants to jump right in
and finish it, be my guest:

to the tune of Oh My Darling Clementine ...

&lt;no verses yet, just the chorus ... and only part of that&gt;

yadda-yadda-yadda &lt;to be filled in later&gt;

chorus:

Fahr-verg-nugen, Fahr-verg-nugen,
Fahr-verg-nugen blah blah blah.

and that's as far as i can get on this one. yeah, well ... it's just an
idea, folks. :)
