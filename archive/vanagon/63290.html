&gt;&gt;While sitting inside a very stuffy vanagon during a torrential downpour at
&gt;&gt;O'Leno State Park Campout this past weekend, we were trying to determine
&gt;&gt;how to improve, increase, or modify ANYTHING to get some ventilation.
&gt;
&gt;Awnings are wonderful for such situations. With the awning extended, you can
&gt;just open the sliding door for all the ventilation you need. And you can sit
&gt;outside as well.

I agree whole heartedly. Works for me, and I spend a lot of time in mine.
