&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Just wanted to let you all know that my new improved website is finally
&gt; ready.  I think.  Go check it out and if anyone finds any errors or bad links
&gt; let me know.  It should be good to go though, I just checked it out.
&gt; 
&gt; I've got some pictures of my bus as well as lots of good links, etc.
