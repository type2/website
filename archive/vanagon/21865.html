The rule of thumb is &quot; you get what you pay for&quot;

1st corollary:  If you are lucky.

If you want quality tools, they are gonna cost appropriately, doesn't matter
who makes them.

My philosophy is unless I know with absolute certainty that I will use this
tool one time and throw it away, or will modify it in some semi-destructive
manner for a one time application and then will throw it away, I will buy the
best quality tool I can afford.  If I happen to be poor enought that all I can
afford is a cheap tool, I have comensurate expectations of it.  Example - I
have one of those $3.99 40 piece SAE/Metric socket and ratchet sets that I
throw in the car.  It is there only for the most dire emergency.  If it gets
stolen - no loss.  All it has to do is work one time.

I am sure that there is equivalently poorly made tools that come from
American, European, and India(ian) manufacturers.
