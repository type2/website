Paul--

Don't know about Syncro specific vacuum hoses, but the ones for regular
vanagons can be had at your local VW/import mechanic for CHEAP (under
$2).  The FLAPS don't seem to have the exact size necessary, only a
little too big and a little too small, but whoever works on VWs (bugs
even) in your town will have the right size.
