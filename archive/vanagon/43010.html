&gt; I have replaced all the curtains in my 71 poptop, except the one on the
&gt; sliding door. I don't have the hardware that holds the curtain in the
&gt; sliding rail. I think they are called &quot;traverse rod carriers&quot;?. The only
&gt; ones I can find at local stores are way too big. Is there a place I can get
&gt; these, or a way to make the curtain work?
According to a post I saved from Jan. 1995, Das Bulli Haus has them NOS,
$4 for a set of 10.  Their number is (203)642-7242.  Don't know if they
still have them, just passing the info along.
