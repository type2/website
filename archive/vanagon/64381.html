Subject:      Re: 87 Syncro Sell or Keep?

if Jaspers(Aftermarket engine manufacturer--excellent quality) makes Audi
engines then do the engine swap.

some things to consider:
what will the use of your van be?  a beast of burden, a long distance
        cruiser, a town car

is almost lightning quick acceleration important to you? if so then look
at porsche, buick's &quot;new&quot; supercharged v-6, chevy.

is price a limiting factor?  if so then is there more than one way to get
        the same result you desire?  if not, get the biggest 911 engine
        you can find and call up Kennedy Engineered Products(no relation to Mr.
        Kennedy on this list) to get an adaptor or you could go all out
        and get an all aluminium dodge viper v-10, i'm sure it'll fit
        amidships rith some major cutting/welding/rebuilding.

how reliable will the replacement engine be?  a trip to the garage every
        week for tender loving care or an oil change every 6 mos or 3,000
        mi.?

if you didn't keep the van, how much would you get for an old beat up
        metal box on wheels?  i recently thought about scrapping my
        1984 Vanagon and found that the blue book value for it was just
        over $1200, not much if you're set on replacing it with another car.

hope i didn't stress you out too much, but then again a little stress
bumps things along every now and then.

whatever you decide, good luck.
