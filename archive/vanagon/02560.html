Subject: Michelin MXL Reinforced Tires for Vanagons
Date: Tue, 2 Aug 94 13:23:14 EDT
From: John Pinkham &lt;John.Pinkham_at_lambada.oit.unc_dot_edu&gt;

Ordered 2 of these yesterday _at_ $93.95 US mounted and balanced. According
to the local dealer, they are sold on an emergency restriction basis. The
dealer has to supply Michelin with the name, vehicle, and telephone number
of the purchaser before Michelin will ship &quot;1 or 2&quot; tires per customer.
Supposedly, the MXL's are not being phased out. However, another dealer
said that they were, and that the unreinforced MX4 with higher load factor
is the replacement.
