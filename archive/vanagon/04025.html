Subject: STATISTICS VANAGON (fwd)


Man!!! I did not even see my name on the list of bigmouths....

Well, anyway, taking heed of Joel's warnings, I thought I'd let you
guys in on how the &quot;Koolatron&quot;  turned out to be. Some of you will remember
that I posted a couple of articles asking questions about whether
the same technology would be applicable to Air-Conditioning, and there
was quite a few messages, and then the interest died (hey, how about
a virtual Corp. that produces plug-in A/C units for older vehicles???!???).

Anyway, back to the topic, I've had the Koolatron box for two weeks now, 
and I guess I cannot complain....  It does keep pretty cool even inside
the van out in the parking lot for over 8hrs., and does not seem to drain
the battery to any noticeable degree.  I got the 30-liter version, which
is quite spacious, but, to my dismay, DOES NOT FIT between the two
front seats of my '87 Weekender :-( ...

It is a nice thing to have for $99.00 plus shipping, but one thing
that really upset me is that they sent me the A/C adaptor and charged
me $49.00 extra for it, even though I specifically asked for it NOT sent
to me.  Even though a $10.00 radio shack adaptor will NOT work here, I can
get a transformer powerful enough for much less than that.  And 4 $1.00
Radio Shack power diodes should do the rest....

I guess I'll have to get on their case and send their adaptor back...

I have not had an occasion to try it in heating mode, but, I imagine
it'll do even better....
