&gt;What would be involved in putting an oil cooler in my 85 Vanagon?  I know
the

Are you looking to use the factory style water to oil cooler, or do you wish
to add an external?

The first one is relatively easy.  You will need the cooler and the long
nipple and nut to mount it.  Find set-up in junk yard off any VW taht used
this set-up,(GLI's and diesels). You will need to cut the engine tin slightly
for clearence.  The best place to connect the water supply is to the heater
circuit.  A couple of tees and some hose, there should be a restriction to
the cooler.  5/16 or 3/8 tube for flow is more than adequate.  You do not
want so much water going through cooler that it wears and leaks internaly.
 ZYou also do not want to reduce flow to the heaters.

If you want to add an external cooler, this is a job.  I use a 16 plate
racimex cooler with an inline thermostat.  Lots of 5/8 copper, and 1/2 inch
hose for the connections.  Cooler is mounted in front of radiator.  Lots of
work.  I use a sandwich adapter betwen the filter and engine to get the flow.
