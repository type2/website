Subject: Re: Fuel Pump Problem?


when waiting for the tank to fill at a gas station, the shmo asked if I 
wanted him to check the oil...
Okay I said, (I didn't think it could hurt), He told me I needed a litre,
I was shocked, It had been full the day before...
I checked, it was still full, buddy had just wanted to sell oil.
Anyway, after leaving the gas station, my van had the same symptoms,
dying at idle.  
I thought that the gas must have been crap, hell I wouldn't put it
past the gas station after the oil thing.
I turned around and went back. I was going to raise a little hell.
I don't know if I was going to hurt the little zitfaced creep who 
wanted to overfill the crankcase or not.
Anyways, I flew over their lawn and pulled hard on the parking brake across
the dinger cord nicely tearing it.
I left the engine running, but of course it stalled, and ran up to the 
bastard who was pumping gas into some little hyundai or such.
As my mind sorted through the possibilities to yell at this cretin, 
I noticed a black circle on the ground right under where my engine had
been when my tank was filling, I thought shit, Oil!, the fucker broke
somthing so that I would need oil.
I took a closer look...  No, It's an oil cap...  Wait a minute...
It's my oil cap.
I picked it up, walked back to the van, looked behind the plate...
Sure enough, the bastard had removed my oil cap, probably when He thought
he was going to sell me a liter.
Anyway, Upon replacing the oilcap the idle was fine and the van didn't
stall.
So check your oil cap, and if it's okay, maybe it's your PCV or somthing.

Kind of a long story just for that but I was reliving it and couldn't stop.
