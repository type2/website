Subject: Re: new buyer old van

To make a long story short(er):  I'm a rookie on the list and have become
particularly interested because I'm in So Calif and my Vanagon (&quot;Wolfie&quot;)
is now in Florida with my youngest daughter and her husband.  It has had
several problems since they adopted it and I plan to get them another
vehicle and drive the Westy ('83 wasser) back to California IF I can get
the thing back on it's feet.  Can anyone highly recommend a Westy Meister
type mechanic that is really good diagnostically and runs a comptetent shop
in South Florida somewhere, hopefully, between Homestead and Miami??????
If so, would be grateful since thusfar my kids have been ripped off by
several successive remove and replace specialists without curing (still)
the constant (as my kids describe it) &quot;running rich, black smoke; may run
ok for a while but when shut down may not restart for an hour or more;
found a loose wire to '#20' position of brain in engine bay to if 'jiggled'
helps it restart...etc.&quot;.  I'm getting totally frustrated with it and hope
to make the swap after the holidays.  Before driving back cross country to
SoCal it would be nice to have this fixed.  It doesn't sound to me like
this couldn't be diagnosed by a sharp mechanic.  Even Miami VW had it a
week and couldn't (I'm told) cure the problem.  Nuff said.  If anyone can
put me on to the details of some good shops in that general area it would
help me greatly.  I'm about ready to fly mine there and give him a week in
Disney world for his trouble.  !!!???  Thanks in advance for any tips.
