&gt; The Multivan was a good trade-off from the camper if you had
&gt; to use it as a bus too.  Pop-top and foldout bed so you can
&gt; sleep 4.  I think it had(s) the optional electric fridge option
&gt; too.  There's a fold out table too.  That's the way I'd go if
&gt; I had to haul a crew around.         

	I agree. I've tried to convince my sister to go thie above route.
	But, like most buyers, she's dazzled by the Previa's shape, meaning
	the functionality of the MV/Weekender doesn't prioritize over looks.

	I work with someone that traded an '8* something camper for an MV
	with weekender pkg. (poptop/12V fridge/aux. battery) and while he
	says sometimes they miss the cook hardware, having more seat room 
	and more window square footage is better for a family of 4+.
