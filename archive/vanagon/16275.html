Subject: FS:   84 VW Vanagon from California
Date: Thu, 20 Apr 1995 13:51:22 GMT

1984 model year
Water cooled, 2 litre, 4 cylinder engine
150,000 miles and still going...
Next to no rust
I have owned it for 5 years and brought it to Canada in 1993
We have bought a newer Toyota van and we don't need two.
I would rather keep the VW, but my wife wants the Toyota. So,
its gotta go.
Asking $3500

reply here or phone 993-1313
