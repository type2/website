     Hi people in Seattle (I hope that's how you spell it),
     
     I know it's kind of off the VW theme but I need a big
     favour off one of you kind people.
     
     My mates mum just came back from a holiday in Seattle
     and when she was there she went to a little gift shop
     situated below the &quot;Space needle&quot;. On returning to the
     UK she really wished she had gotten the little Totem Pole
     figures that she had seen in the shop.
     
     All that I am asking is, would any kind soul be able to 
     email me the name and address of this little gift shop. All
     I know is that it is at the base of the &quot;Space needle&quot;.
     Hey the phone number would be cool as well.
     
     I hope that someone can help.
     
     Lee.
