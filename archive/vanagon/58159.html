Subject: Re: Rusty coolant pipes on '83.5 Westy

&gt;place near the engine.  Does anyone have a creative solution that would
&gt;avoid the $120 per pipe and $300 labor necessary to remove the gas tank


heater hose, 1&quot; ID, 10 feet of it. plus a heavy steel plumbing adapter (1.25
to 1.0&quot; I think) to join the fat hose in engine compartment to heater hose,
or simply cut off 3&quot; from each end of your steel hose and use for joint
(best sol'n, mine were shot) Double screw clamp each splice as there won't
be a ridge to prevent pulloff with one clamp, and use some goop to seal it
all. This is a DIY job, just get the gas tank empty and drop it.  Need the
front up high on jackstands. Takes an afternoon.  You should check/clean-up
the top of the gas tank and replace the two little rubber vent hole grommets
while there.  Tim
