Subject: CCC's June 14th camping trip stuff

Only another week!  Hope you all can still make this.  I'm
still finalizing directions, and will have them to you
at least by the beginning of next week.

In the meantime, I forgot to tell all of you that the
&quot;Itlian&quot; cuisine theme has been expanded to be &quot;Mediterrnean,&quot;
so maybe we'll get more signups.  We need a lot more food -
please sign up for something for dinner either Friday or
Saturday, and stuff for breakfasts.

Also, I forgot to tell you all to bring tables, since
we'll be in the wilderness, with no amenities.  Folding
shaky ones will be better than nothing.

Other reminders of stuff to include:

folding chairs
firewood (LOTS)
explosives, etc.
ice
water
drinks, food
toilet paper, book, shovel.  :)

Thanks..
