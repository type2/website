So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Have you received any e-mail from him?  Was it at all &quot;different?&quot;
&gt; /m
&gt; 

I have only corresponded a little with him.  He asked if I was going
to Red Rock and thought I might like to caravan with him down a
while back.  At the time, I said I'd not be going.  And he replied
that he understood (I think he did. It's been a while).  Since he
doesn't post alot, I'd assume he's not as in to the Vanagon thing
as much as the rest of us are.  I haven't noticed any strange 
writings.  Hmmmmm.  Of course, now you tell me after I just asked
him if he was still interested in caravaning down. :(   ;)

Oh well, We'll see what happens.

Cheers!

Steven
