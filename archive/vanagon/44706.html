Subject: Re: performance tires

In 1973 when I got my '66 camperbus I used to practice breaking loose the
rear end going around the &quot;gloriettas&quot; or in less colorful language,
traffic circles in Stockton, CA.  I had 185x14&quot; radials of low quality.  I
never came close to rolling the vehicle on dry streets.  I once did two
near perfect 360s in a row around a glorietta about 50' in diameter with
five people in the bus who spent most of the time hanging on or tumbling.

I found the key to safe sliding is making sure you break the rear end
loose before the lean gets too radical.
