Subject: Re[2]: $25,000 in Syncro Camper repairs

Harry Yates Sez:

&gt;It's a lemon.  VW should have bought it back from you.  This is nuts, 
&gt;and I sympathize.  I was getting quite frustrated with our van, but I 
&gt;hung in there.  We decided to keep it until the original factory 
&gt;warranty terminated (which ws 3 years/60000 km).  If it didn't 
&gt;smarten up we were going to dump it.  Fortunately, the van has been 
&gt;great the last 3 years (touch wood, BIG TIME!!).  I can forgive the 
&gt;waterpump... sometimes things happen.

&gt;&gt; My warranty expires in 1997. When that happens, what should I do?  

&gt;If it doesn't behave itself up until the warranty expires, dump it.  
&gt;It would be a nice selling point to have some warranty left on the 
&gt;van for resale... is it transferrable?

&gt;&gt; I am contemplating suicide.  

&gt;Don't do that!  Buy another van, and start over :)  

I agree!!

There are far too many Syncros on the road out here in Seattle for this 
to be the standard experience.

I see both Vanagon and Westy Syncros all the time that are obviously 
daily drivers and are obviously not receiving the meticulous care and 
maintenance we cognocenti lavish upon them, yet there they are, cruisin' 
down the road, mile after mile, missing hubcaps, dents and all.

And aren't there jillions of Syncros in both van and truck format on the 
road in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and elsewheres? They couldn't 
have all been this bad or VW would have had to have done something 
pretty major about it (something someone on the list would have heard 
about, no?).

I know that my '87 had CV joint problems (3 replaced) and a failed water 
pump that were taken care of under warranty before I purchased it, but 
the original owner claimed he'd had no problems in the last 20k miles 
he'd put on it, and all I've done in the past ten is replace the 
alternator.

My mechanic works on several Syncros and says that he doesn't see them 
in any more often than 2wd Vanagons (which may not be saying much).

Get VoA to buy back this van from you and recompensate you for your time 
and effort!! I looked at an '89 on a dealer lot that VoA had bought back 
in just this fashion (specifically for the head gasket and resultant 
fried engine problem. They put a new engine in, slapped on a 6 mo. 
warranty and sold it to a dealership at auction), so I know that it's 
possible.

Once you have your settlement, come out here and find a low mileage 91 
with a trouble free history and make it yours!!
