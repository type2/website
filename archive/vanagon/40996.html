Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

I sent away for a Bus Boys catalog about two years ago as well. 
Absolutely no response. I don't think the check was cashed however ($2 
or $3 at that time). Since I didn't have a bus at the time, and just 
wanted the catalog for reference, I just chalked it up to being lost in 
the mail and went on with life.
	Now this week, I am looking at purchasing a restorable condition 
1965 Micro Deluxe. I sent away for the catalog again last Monday. Now 
thanks to you list members I find that this elusive catalog is a 
difficult bird to capture.
	Can anybody explain why pi**ing off the customer even before 
they place an order helps business? I'll give them a few weeks to make 
good - if they don't - I say we gang up on them (letters, lost business, 
lawsuits?) I think we have some pull here, right?

&gt; I send Bus Boys a letter threatening them with a postal
&gt; investigation unless I get my money back (by now I don't want their
&gt; catalog).  I get a check right away sent Express Mail, with an apology and a
&gt; promise to send the catalog soon...  Well, I am still waiting for that
&gt; catalog...
