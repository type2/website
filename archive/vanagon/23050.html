Hi All!

I'm brand new to this mail list and am already impressed with the quantity
and
quality of postings. I'll do my intro, then get to some comments on a DIESEL 

powered '94 Eurovan Westfalia that my wife and I borrowed from a dear friend 

this weekend.

Last fall we I moved from St. Paul, Minnesota to Vancouver, B.C. for a year
so I
could do my psychology internship. We sold our Golfs and bought a slightly
used,
red '93 Eurovan MV from our favorite dealership (WestSide WV in Minneapolis. 

P.S. paid $18,500 in Spring '94, it had 12K miles on it--how'd we do?).

Loved it from the start--huge interior space,and you gotta love the cool
back-facing removable seats and pop-up table. Left one of those removable
seats
with mom and dad, crammed in a ton of stuff, and headed west. Made the trip
in
about three days.

We've had a great year in Vancouver. We've loved going camping in BC and
Washington. The recent post describing the trip through BC interior sounds
like
one of our trips. Our only complaint about the MV is that the back
seat/roll-out
bed is a little too contured and therefore very lumpy for sleeping, and our
milage has been really poor in hilly Vancouver!

We've discovered that B.C. is definitely Westfalia Country! You can't turn
around with seeing them everywhere, and we've fallen in love with them! 
We've
decided to sell our MV next fall after we're back in Minnesota and fly back
out
to Oregan or Washington to find and drive back a '89-'91 Westie. We'd like 
to
buy one here in B.C. as there seems to be a much wider variety of all VWs
than
we've seen at home (does VW of America import fewer variations?), but we're
not
sure about how the importing back to the US would go. Any tips would be
appreciated--whether we buy in the US or figure out how to do it in Canada.
Also
trying to figure out what we should expect to pay; definitiely want a
four-speed
with A/C and aux heater! Maybe we'll go for it and try to find a Syncro!

I have also seen the newer, Eurovan Wesfalias here--never saw one in the US.
We
have visited lots of dealers and checked them all out. Very nice, tight
camper,
everything you'd hope for! We finally got our chance to borrow one from our
friend Jurgen last weekend for a trip through the interior. As I mentioned
above, this was a diesel--the first diesel VW I've seen since my old Rabbit.
Our
dominant impression with it is that it is S L O W ! Jurgen said it has
something
like 76 h.p., and man, it needs every bitof it. Getting through the 
mountains
was an exercise in patience! We also thought that the pop top was a little
tight
at the foot end; we really felt the space was too tight down there. Aside
from
these (minor) comnplaints, we really loved it, but became convinced that we
want
to get a Vanagan Westie.

We've been looking at the new Winegabo conversions, too. We've been told by
dealers that WV of Canada will not get any more EV Westfalias, and will be
selling the same Winebagos that are currently available in the US. We think
that's too bad--they're very nice, but also very large. I'd be interested in 

hearing from anyone who has one to hear how it is for running around town. 
It
seems like the new, stretch (is it realy 16&quot; longer than the regular
Eurovan?)
campers get too much into the &quot;small camper&quot; realm and away from the
&quot;multipurpose cool vehicle&quot; realm.

Just some thoughts--Really enjoying this list!

 -Steve

Soon: Very cool 89-91 Westie with the works!
