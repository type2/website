Subject: Re: Brake Drum Removal

The other day I was talking to the owner of a 1986 Westi.

He pulled out of a box a &quot;tool&quot; that a local mechanic made for him to help pull the rear 
drums.

It consisted of a metal ring with holes drilled in it to correspond to the drum's wheel lug 
bolt holds.  Welded to the ring where two perpendicular tabs mounted opposite of each other, 

with 3/4&quot; holes in each.

You simply bolt this ring to the drum.  Then, pry the drum off by hand or with a breaker bar 

through the tab holes.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, you don't HAVE to remove the hub.  The hub and drum on the Vanagon 
&gt;&gt; &gt; are &quot;split&quot;, so you can remove the drum without removing the hub. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; True.  The drum and hub are seprable.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;Besides, that way you don't need a giant socket, a hub 
&gt;&gt; &gt; puller and a breaker bar capable of 360 ft-lbs.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sorry.  Yes you do.  The drum can't come off without taking off the big 46mm
&gt;&gt; &quot;castle&quot; nut.  After you remove the nut, you could remove the two bolts that
&gt;&gt; hld the hub to the drum and then remove the drum without the hub, but I don't
&gt;&gt; see why anyone would want to do such a thing.
&gt;
&gt;Now, think about this a bit....... The drum is a COMPLETELY seperate 
&gt;piece of metal from the hub.  The drum is held to the hub by the two small
&gt;bolts and nothing else.  Remove the two nuts and there is NOTHING holding 
&gt;the drum in place.  YOU DON'T NEED TO REMOVE THE 46mm NUT to remove the 
&gt;hub (in theory).
&gt;
&gt;I throw in the &quot;in theroy&quot; qualifier because frequently the hub and the 
&gt;drum weld themselves together with rust, and it can be a PITA to try and 
&gt;get just the drum off.  There was a recent thread about seperating the 
&gt;two in such a condition; get a big hammer and hit the drum hard to break 
&gt;the bond between the two.  The other thing that can happen is the drum 
&gt;gets worn away by the brake shoes to such an entent that the drum has a 
&gt;deep (~1mm) &quot;valley&quot; where the shoe rubs against it, making it hard to 
&gt;get the drum off without backing off the shoes.
&gt;
&gt;Since you just did the year brakes on the wife's car (and, I'm assuming, 
&gt;seperated the drum and hub while you had them off) run out to the car 
&gt;RIGHT NOW (I also assume it's nice and warm where you live) and try it.  
&gt;While you have your drum off, put a small smear of grease where the drum 
&gt;and hub come together so they don't weld themselves together again.
