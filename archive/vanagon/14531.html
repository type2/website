You know I don't think that all the data is in regarding vanagons. For
example I was told by the parts guy at my local VW dealer that they had
service a Vanagon with a watercooled six. I, of course, with my vast (or
is it half-vasted?) knowledge disputed this, but he held firm to his story.
Our collective canon of Vanagon lore is not chiselled on tablets.

Alistair, still trying to be open to new ideas
