Subject: Backfires?
Date: Thu, 5 Oct 1995 11:13:29 -0500 (CDT)

My bus has started backfiring when I shut it off -- anyone know what this is
from? It was a weber carb, so doesn't have the &quot;electro-magnetic fuel
cut-off jet&quot; as on the Solexs, which is how VW solved the problem before FI,
but this wasn't doing it before. 
   I was priced a weber rebuild kit at $35 at my FLAPS, which seemed
outrageous for a needle and seat and a couple of gaskets, etc. -- plus I'm
not exactly sure which model it is -- the only numbers are the ones on each
barrel, a 26 and a 27 with a cirlce around them. My Hanes Weber manual only
talks about a 32/36 DF* in the section with pictures that look like this
carb, but the barrels are clearly 26 &amp; 27, not 32/36 --- does anyone know if
this is the right model designation? I sure don't want to pay $35 for the
kit only to find it doesn't work.
