&gt; The tent that came with my bus attaches to the sides of the body at the 
&gt; rear door, it's roof being supported by the opened hatch. The question is 
&gt; - what good is it?
&gt; It's only an extension, approx 4-5 feet long and, of course, the width of 
&gt; the bus.  Is this a gear stowage area, or a place to work on the engine 
&gt; if it's raining. :-)

This could be the famous &quot;privy&quot; tent!  Private room for your porta potty.

Though maybe it could be set up to receive the hot mist spray from
your evaporative cooler Porsche fan set-up, you could have a hot 
shower! ;-)
