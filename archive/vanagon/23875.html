Subject: Re: Death to VW Vandals


Serious drag bruddah,

Mine is currently garaged, and my shitty Honda sits on the
highly popular-to-vandalize-all-cars street, but soon the
Honda will be replaced with something shiny, new and expensive.

What to do, what to do, what to do?  Risk theft of my *priceless*
camper, or risk eons of dollars worth of damage to my new expensive
ride?

My condolescences go out to you.  Death to all vandals period!

Danny
'60 camper
