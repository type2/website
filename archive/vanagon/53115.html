- You need an email filter. I don't know what you are using for email
but if it's on a unix machine you can use procmail. Procmail reads
your email and decides what folder to put it in. It's the most popular
mail filter. Personally, I prefer deliver, but it's more work. Recent
version of Eudora also have options for doing this kind of filtering. 

- Any decent web search engine should be able to find procmail.
Deliver is part of the Slackware linux release.
