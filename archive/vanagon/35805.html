&gt;&gt; 	My biggest pet pieve so far though is that the defroster won't 
&gt;&gt; run without the compressor on.  Why does VW think you need to run the 
&gt;&gt; compressor to blow heat onto the windshield?

&gt;I know it's not much of a consolation, but my Mustang has this &quot;feature&quot;
&gt;too.  

My understanding of the reason for the compressor running is to help 
de-humidify the air to make the defrosting quicker and more complete. The 
moisture that we breathe out is what condenses on the cold windows. I also 
made sure that, if I had the option, I wasn't just reciculating inside aire 
but drawing it from outside.
