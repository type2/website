&gt;I named my bus &quot;Mack.&quot; After the architect Mark Mack. I did a staircase for
&gt;one of his homes in L.A. and I have been copying his style as I re-do the
&gt;interior of my 1969 Camper.

Hmmmmmmmmm........Now a staircase in a Camper of any year would be worth
looking at, especially in a High Top Camper. :)))
