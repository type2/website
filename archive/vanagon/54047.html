Subject: Fwd: Vanagons in junkyards in Columbus OH area?

I was told by a former list member that a place called City Auto had two of
them.  Last time I was in Ohio, I stopped by at 3:00 Sat.  They closed at
2:30 and the guys standing around wouldn't tell me if they had them or not.
 I talked with the owner and he gave me a refrigerator magnet/business card
(which is on my desk at work, or I'd pass on the number) and said call him
Monday.  I didn't because I had to be in Illinois on Monday.  Its on my list
to give them a call before the next trip.

I'd be really interested to know if they have some and what is left on them.

Does anybody know of any junkyards in the Columbus Ohio area that have 
water-cooled Vanagons?
