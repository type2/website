Subject: Towing Vanagon

I recently towed an 85 manual transmission camper 725 miles using a car 
dolly.

The VW dealer was no help, and most others I asked were not knowledgeable 
about towing front or backward, but many people had lots of opinions.

My experience is that towing it backward with the front wheels locked 
resulted in severe whipping at about 35 mph.  Very nearly put me in the 
ditch.

Towing with the front wheel on the dolly was smooth and uneventful as 
fast as 65 mph.

Note that the Bentley says towing the manual transmission frontward can 
be done at any speed for any distance.  I should have believed the book 
and now do.
