Subject: Re: Resurrection of '64 Deluxe

I plan to tow the newly acquired '64 Sunroof Deluxe Bus home this evening 
and start the process of getting it back on the road.  It has been 
sitting (inside a barn) for 13 years.  I will drop the motor and pull the 
tank (to have it cleaned), will replace the fuel pump and probably 
rebuild the carb.  Dave Easterwood suggested that I go ahead and rebuild 
the motor (the Bus has 61K miles).  I would like to get this Bus going ASAP, 
but if a rebuild is required, then it will be done (but probably not by 
me).  I also plan to change all fluids and refresh all lubricants.  Any 
other ideas or requirements?

my two cents:

brakes:   replace rubber lines, rebuild/replace all wheel cylinders.  check
master cylinder,  flush  system

motor-
drain oil.   is their lots of gunk in it?    i would recommend tear apart,
clean, and put back together.  rebuild the heads, a valve may stick.   

if you don't want to hassle, at least replace the main and oil cooler seals.
  when you start it up,   let it idle for 15 minutes, then change the oil
agin.   don't go on the freeway for 500 miles. 

change the gear oil and new trans boots.

new gas line

cleaning the tank is a good idea.  last june  i resurrected a 70 camper that
had been sitting in my dad's neighbors yard for aboyt ten years.   or more,
it was unclear.    The gas had turned to varnish in the tank.    The line
kept clogging with black tar.   i eventualyy said blast the tank, and drove
to washington with a line running out of a 5 gallon jerry can in the spare
wheel well. 
it was an interesting story, maybe ill post the whole thing one day.

also the story of rescuing the 54 kombi- driving 500 miles to idaho with my
partner all the tools and parts needed to drive it home, us spending three
days in the dirt (no hot water) putting the fun into functional, when it
hadn't been in twenty years, and driving that sucker home.  whoole thing took
5 days.   come on Bob, get it going!

how's that for a vw show game?   race to get the wreck going?!

i think my imagination is taking a bizarre flight of fancy, i see a line of
buses being furiously worked on.  right next to the shiny show cars.
yeah, ok, never mind     i just slept for too long
