Subject: Anyone want a '68 bus? (bay area)

A guy was walking by me yesterday as I was adjusting my brakes (they work 
great now), and mentioned that he had a bus also.  He said that it had 
thrown a rod.  So I asked what he was going to do with it... he wasn't 
quite sure.  So I asked if he might like to sell it, and he said he'd 
like to get about $400 before he moves to Oakland, but I'm sure he'd go 
for a little less.  He said it still runs, just knocks real badly.  He 
said the tranny worked fine also.  Looks to be a westy with the side 
louvered windows.  The guy said he'd stop by today, so whoever might be 
interested email me, and I'll let you know what he says.

And so y'all know it's location, it's in Hayward, CA.  That's the East 
San Fransisco bay area.  Motto of Hayward is 'Heart of the Bay.'
