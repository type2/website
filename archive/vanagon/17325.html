&gt; &gt;Chris -- do you have door handles in addition to the pull
&gt; &gt;straps, or just the straps?  Curious....
&gt; Uh ... I have a door thingy.  About 9&quot; long, horizontally mounted, a screw 
&gt; at either end.  I would call it a door handle, but I'm not sure about what 
&gt; you're calling a strap.
Sounds like what I'm calling a strap -- yeah, about 9&quot; long, 1&quot; wide,
black ribbed plastic/rubber. What I'm calling a handle is more
like  a domestic ('64 Mopar?) door handle -- solid, with a hollowed-
out portion next to the door.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that the door ventalation Isn't there because we have the vents at 
&gt; the floor, behind the seats.  Like under the walk-thru.  At least I have 
&gt; them. :-)
Looking at my plumbing, that thingy that always gets crudded up
with pencils, pipe cleaners, straw papers, &amp;c is heat only. The vent
to the back would seem to have to come from under the dash and get
distributed to the doors to empty out in the rear....I don't seem
to see any provision for that in mine....Hmmm.

Is there anyone out there with a non-Westy '71 with the air channels
on the doors, so we can compare notes (I'll show you mine if you
show me yours!)?
