Subject: Question on shocks

Our recently acquired '85&quot;WWW&quot; appears to have a &quot;sag&quot; problem, as the body
is several inches lower at the rear of the vehicle than the front.  Is this
normal for a westy weekender, or is  an indication that the rear shocks need
to be beefed up?  If so, is shock replacement a &quot;backyard&quot; job?
