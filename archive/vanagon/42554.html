&gt;The plastic gear that drives the odometer tends to crack. This has been a
&gt;problem with all VDO speedos since they switched that gear from brass to
&gt;plastic back in 73 or so.  Notice how nobody has an odometer that works
&gt;properly.  Gear not available.  You may be able to slide it off and crazy
&gt;glue or epoxy it back on the shaft.

        This is exactly right. Where the gear cracks from its centre out
radially
to between two teeth, it makes the spacing on the teeth tips too wide, and
that's where it binds, forcing the shaft to slip on the gear, and therefore no
odometer progress.

        You must take the gear off the shaft and enlarge the hole just a tad
so as to relieve the pressure and allow the crack to come together and the
tooth tip spacing to return to normal. Then roughen up the shaft a little to
grip the epoxy, then epoxy the gear back onto the shaft.

        Good luck.
