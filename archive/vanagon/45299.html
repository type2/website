Subject: GEX update

     I now have over 1000 miles on the rebuilt 1600 SP and virtually no 
     problems.  One very small oil leak.  It starts and runs smoothly.  All 
     cylinders show good, even compression.  I have worked with the owner 
     at GEX and Mick in Warranty Service and I have to tell you that even 
     though I drove them crazy with my frustrations about the problems on 
     the motor I first received, they hung with me, responding rather well 
     even when I was ranting and not being particularly polite.  I am 
     satisfied with the way they both handled my problems, convincing me 
     that they actually wanted me to have a good strong motor for my old 
     bus.  They even talked to me about and offered advice on other systems 
     than the motor and helped me with some diagnostic problems.  It has 
     been a long process, mostly due to my occasionally poor health and 
     inability to work on it when I needed to.  It has also been an 
     educational process.  I know so much more than I did a year ago, just 
     by experience.  I can now drop a motor in less than an hour! Yay.
     
     This is not a commercial but it's only fair that after ranting about 
     GEX when my motor went bad that I now praise them for the way they 
     helped me solve these problems.  Of course that's their responsibility 
     but we all know that not every company will stand by that ethic. 
     
     I also want to thank listmembers Dave Easterwood, Bob Hoover, Kevin 
     Murray, and Michael Heron for all their knowledge and encouragement.  
     It is just stone true that I wouldn't have completed this project 
     without them.  You're a great bunch of people.  Now onto the bodywork!
