How's it doing?

Still doing great, Weston, et al.  I think I may recoat it in 6 months
or so again, for added protection and to freshen up the white color, but
it's behaved as promised, hasn't cracked or leaked, and  solved all
my problems.  I wish it were shiny and slick in appearance, though, rather
than rubbery and porous looking.  But it seems to protect, cover, and
hold up well.  It's called Kool Seal Elastomeric Roofcoating, and is
available (probably among other places) at Camping World.  I used about
1/2 gallon to do my roof, and did several coats.  It's water soluable,
and very easy to use and clean up.  I used the same company's other
products to patch and seal a crack I had near the skylight opening space,
and this also behaved asmirably.  Good luck...
