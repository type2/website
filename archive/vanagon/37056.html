Subject: /f Email Whine

Hello,

Sorry for the non-VW content, but as you folks are the nicest group of 
folks on any email or newsgroup that I have had contact with, I thought 
that I'd whine here.

Why don't system administrators and service providers think email is like 
paper mail?  You know, &quot;Neither sleet nor snow etc..&quot;

Either my company's service provider or one of the system administrators of 
one of my company's internal nodes trashed all of my and everybody else's 
mail for all of last weekend.  I waited a few days to see if there were any 
three day bounces, but there were none.  It all was just dumped without so 
much as an apology.

I believe that I have the right to whine.  I am a system administrator, and 
I would not intentionally trash one single mail message for my customers. 
 And, if I screwed up, or mail was lost because of some random event, I 
hope that I would at least notify everyone and apologize if appropriate.

Thanks for listening,
Mike
