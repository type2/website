Subject: Re: Michelin Tires

I had a set of XC/LT4's installed last year and they've been great so far.
They feel stable, they're not too noisy, and they look good on the van. I
don't drive the van in snow (rarely in rain), so I can't offer an opinion on
the all weather characteristics of the tire. I paid about $75 per at Sears.

Any thoughts on the Michelin XC/LT4 LT195/75R14 as a good tire for an 84
Westie? And on this endless subject, how come Volkswagen of America does
not/will not supply specific tires suggestions for Westies?  Or why do tire
companies only provide recommendations for the standard Vanagon?
