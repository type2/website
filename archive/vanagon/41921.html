Subject: Throttle cable woes

Last night I was going over to my friend's house, ripping along the highway
at about 60, when all of a sudden I lost power.  I look down and the oil light
was glowing dimly.  While trying to coast off the road, I noticed the 
gas pedal was quite flaccid, so I knew waht was up.  Went back to the engine
compartment, and sure enuf,the throttle cable was snapped off at the 
barrel nut.

No problem, I'll just rig it up and be on my way (having put my spare on
a couple months ago)  so I crawled under the front, and lo and behold its
broken there, too!

If I hadn't been driving on the freeway when it broke, I would have suspected 
sabotage!

Anyone ever had it break on both ends at the same time before?

So at lunch I'm gonna bum a ride and pick up 3 cables.
