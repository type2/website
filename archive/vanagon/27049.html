Subject: Recommendation on Slick 50 

To All

I was at the Sydney Motor Show on Wednesday and a man on the Slick 50 stand 
impressed me with his display of engines parts that had survived extreme 
overheating because they had the Slick 50 treatment.

I'm having my engine rebuilt (hope to get it back this weekend) and he 
recommended that after it's properly run in, I should do a Slick 50 treatment (naturally).

750ml is recommended for my engine and it's $A70, ie fairly expensive, 
but good insurance if its good for 80,000km as he claimed.

My question: Does anyone have any experience with Slick 50? Would you 
recommend its use?

Thanks
