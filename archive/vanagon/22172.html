Subject: thanks, and another van for sale

thanks for all the responses re the non-starting vw. sounds like the solenoid
and/or wiring is suspect, even though it was recently replaced. I'll let him
know Monday.

In the meantime, I saw an early Vanagon (air cooled) sitting in a Park-and-Ride
lot near here. Looked like the price said $2500 in the window, but I was
going by too fast to be sure. Let me know if you're interested and I'll get
up  there tomorrow and get the phone number. It was a duotone, white/yellow
combo,
not a camper though.
