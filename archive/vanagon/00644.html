Subject:      vw parts microfiche ... anybody want one?

ok, i'm gonna do something really stupid this time (again?): some of you
already have gotten the fiche from me, and i've been doling them out a few
at a time. but finally i sat down and made a list of what i have left.

regrettably, i do NOT have any for the 1968-1979 buses ... they haven't been
reprinted in so long, the dealer is hanging on the only ones he has. sorry.

so why do i do this? well, i don't know. these things are not doing me any
good, and they might be useful to some of you. information is like manure
(in a lot of ways!): it helps more if you spread it around. :)

any of you who DO NOT already have one, it can be quite helpful sometimes in
figuring out how something comes apart or goes back together. don't have a
fiche reader? check the local public library or college library. some of them
even have printers on their fiche readers.

so anyway, i get these things free from a  dealer (you might check with your
own local parts guy and see if he'll give you one/some), so if you want one
let me know. i'll need a postal address to ship it.

explanation:
Vanagon Mod. 86-88 (G,H,J)   1-1989
means
Vanagon Models 1986 through 1988 (VIN year numbers G, H, J),
   fiche #1 issued in 1989.

86 &gt; (G) means from 1986 onward (after 1986). the (G) means that is the model
covered when this fiche was issued.
