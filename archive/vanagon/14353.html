&gt; I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
&gt; to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt; easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt; go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
&gt; and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt; it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?

It should be easier to take out the motor by itself.  On the '74, does the
rear apron come off, like earlier busses?
