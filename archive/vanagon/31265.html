Hi,

Ready to head down to Baja next week for 4-5 days.

This will be the 1st long trip(not that long) for the 76 Westy.  I have put
3000+ miles on it since I have had it with very few minor problems and no
major ones at all!(Is This A Bad Sign)? and feel very confident it is up to
the trip.

I just would like any advice on things to take with us, etc.  I know all of
you are overflowing with knowledge and advise!!  We will be staying both in
Hotels and in the Bus depending on the conditions.  I also need info on how
to prep the water tank which appears clean inside but has not been used in a
long time.

Another other input is always appreciated, being that this is our first
mini-trek in the bus I will take any advice I can get.

This will be a 3 vehicle caravan---76 westy--Mid 80's Toyota P/U--Older
Style Jeep Cherokee---This will be a surfing and Shopping Adventure that we
have decided to document on Video tape(This should be interesting.)


Thanks again---and I look forward to you replies.
