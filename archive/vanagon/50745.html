Subject: Re: Tires FS and New Carat in the 'hood


These tires should be fine for a regular Vanagon.  I have Michelins
this size on my GL and they are great.  I do not use these on either
the Kombi or the Westfalia, though.  The tires have an 80k warranty
as well, and the Vanagon was listed by Michelin as applicable for 
both this size and for the warranty.  I run 35lbs in them, the maximum
I believe.  These tires are wider, and thus have a larger footprint
and need less air pressure.  They ride nicer, too.

I run 195/75 14LT Uniroyal Laredo's on my Westy, and it rides like a truck,
but I take it rather overloaded on many trips in God-forsaken places
(or wonderful places).  I run 215/75 15LT Laredos on the Kombi.
