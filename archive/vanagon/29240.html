Subject: I got a Problem..Is help on the Way?

hey now,

bus has been running great...until yesterday. was down at my folks near Mt.
Gilead searching for a rumored VW Graveyard which i never found but did find
bunches of ford, etc graveyards. okay...sunday morning i go  to get the paper
and i'm going fine....stop, hop out, get the paper and the engine dies as i
get back in. starts back up fine. i'm a little low on gas so i figure i'll tank
up....engine stops everytime i idle. i tank up, go on my way and it doesn't
happen again that day...i drive 100 miles or so back home...no problem.

this morning i start the bus to warm her up for the drive to work no problem.
drive 10+ miles with no problems then stop for traffic and she cuts off. starts
back up fine...popped the clutch...and fight it all the way to work. when i get
to work i let her sit for about 3 minutes...hit the gas peddle once...she
starts up fine and idles perfect. hmmm, what's going on here?
