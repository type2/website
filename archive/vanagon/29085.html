&gt; While in the process of installing an in-line blower in my 1972 Pop-Top, I
&gt; managed to break off the entire tube (the tube that runs from the junction of
&gt; the heat exchangers and the front of the van).  It was a litttle more rusty
&gt; than I expected.  Any thought on fixing this?  

We put a piece of PVC pipe in my friend's '59. Works a treat - he never
realized he could have that much heat!
