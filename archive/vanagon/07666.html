Subject: Westy update

Here's a short summary of the status of my formerly topless '71
Westfalia (for those who didn't read my post some weeks ago, basically
what happened is that my Westfalia was being transported to Arizona
from California, and the moving company managed to hit a freeway 
underpass with my car and rip the fiberglass top off):

I went to look at it this weekend, and boy, it sure looks good!  The
&quot;new&quot; fiberglass top has been sanded and painted (looks shiny and new),
they have repaired and painted the top of the van, the new canvas is
nearly completely installed (quality of material doesn't seem as good
as the original, tho), and new rubber seals are installed.  From the rain
gutter up, the thing looks brand new! (also a new wood headliner!)

The guy doing the work initially offered me what amounted to $3300 for
it, but I turned him down, cause it's worth more to me as it is than
any money I could get for it.  The rest of the interior is in pretty
good shape (and they are also going to replace the carpeting on the
floor), the engine is fresh (&lt;3000mi on rebuild), and except for the
exterior paint, the body is in good shape (it also has brand new
Uniroyal LT radials).  It will probably be ready for me to pick up
this coming weekend, and believe me, I'm excited about finally getting
it back!  And to think, I nearly sold it before I left CA!
