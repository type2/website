&gt;&gt; &gt;I just came across a 1985 Westy Synchro w/50k miles for $10k. Is it worth
it?
&gt;&gt; &gt;What should I be looking for while cheking it out? Advise??

&gt;&gt; I'd never buy any 1985 Syncro.  VW did not start selling them until 1986
as
&gt;&gt; 1986 models.  Either it's not a Syncro or it's not a 1985 or someone has
&gt;&gt; assembled their own hybrid.  Valid Syncro model years in the USA are 1986,
&gt;&gt; 1987, 1989, 1990, &amp; 1991.  Question everything else.
 
&gt;Don't have the bentley handy, but don't the first few letters of 
&gt;the serial# tell the model year? This should clear things up (or 
&gt;maybe not...)

Yeah, If the original poster is still reading this thread, here goes.

The VIN should look something like this:

WV2YB0259GG123456

W=Germany
V=Volkswagen
1=Multi purpose vehicle
Y=Deluxe van, windows
B=Waterboxer engine
0=Something about passenger restraints
25=Van body style
9=secret check digit number
G=Model Year, F=85, G=86, H=87, J=88, K=89, L=90, M=91(No USA 1988 Syncros)
G=Graz Austria factory, H=Hanaover Germany factory (Syncros=G)
123456=Sequential production number


Hope this helps,

87 GL Syncro
88 GL Wolfsburg
