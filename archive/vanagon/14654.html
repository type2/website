Subject: Re: DIESEL VANAGON QUESTIONS

Those of you interested in diesels may want to phone Scott Foss
Auto Repair in San Rafael, CA (sorry I don't have the number, but
recall it's in information).  I spoke with him once on the phone,
and he said it was the first time he'd ever received a call from
a female.  He does I believe servicing and replacing of diesels,
perhaps in other cars as well, but certainly in the vanagon,
and sometimes has some for sale.  I was specifically interested
in his modification of converting the thing to turbo, for, otherwise,
air-conditioning would not be possible on the regular diesel
engine.  I seem to recall that he did mention dropping rebuilt
rabbit diesels in them...hope that helps.
