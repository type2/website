Yeah, by all means the two-battery setup is the minimum acceptable for the
electric fridge -- if you've just gotta have one. A dead battery in the woods
at wake-up time has just gotta ruin an otherwise perfect day --- maybe you
could remember to park headed downhill ?! Me, I drilled a hole in the bottom
of the box, siliconed in a drain thingy and go with the sack or (if you can
get it) block of ice. BTW, did you hear about the guy who threw a block of
dry ice in on top of his bacon, eggs and liverwurst? Rilly happened.
