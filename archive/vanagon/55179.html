Subject: VOTEX reference on WWW


On my search to the VOTEX after-market parts,
specially for quad headlight grills, I found
an URL from a VAG dealer somewhere in
Germany offering VOTEX parts. On the web you
will find some parts about VW Golf, AUDI A3
and others but no Vanagon or EV. I ordered a
catalog about the to last vehicles and will
you inform about this next time.

Enjoy  http://www.micropoint_dot_de/ahp/start.html
