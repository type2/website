&gt;how dare they tell me i can't order a vanagon with rubber floormats! why
&gt;can't i get a panel van? a pickup truck? why didn't VWOA import buses with
&gt;dual sliding doors twenty years ago!!! the dual sliding door has been
&gt;available from the factory since 1966 or so.

Actually, my parent's '72 bus (named Vanessa) was special ordered with dual 
sliding doors - I'm not sure if this was a normal option or if they had to 
ship one specially over from Deutschland, but by any means it was great, what 
with four kids and all.  They also had the bus converted into a Campmobile (I 
think it was called) by one of those Winnabago-esque outfits that clutter 
much of northern Indiana.

Mechanically, we almost always spent part of any long distance vacation in 
some VW shop or other as the mechanics tried to figure out the then-new 
suitcase engine.  Despite some odd problems when the car was new, it served 
its purpose well up until about 1988.  At that point I was in college and got 
the hankering for my very own VW, bought a '70 bus.  She was so beautiful I 
had to name her Vanna, after the venerable Vanna White.

Now looking for another bus in the  central Indiana/ eastern Illinois area.   
Anyone out there selling?
