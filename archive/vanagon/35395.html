Subject: re: tires

I also recently took the plunge and bought new tires.  The PO had uniroyal
tiger paws 18970R14 I believe.  I purchased uniroyal Laredos.  The choice
came from a combination of what Joel Walker recommended, what was
available (Pep Boys would not/could not sell me anything but
Continentals-Yikes!) and what I could afford.  The ride is improved over
the tiger paws(Once i inflated the tires to VW recommended pressure) but I
believe that the Tiger Paws provided better traction in snow.  Total
$dammage for 4 tires, mounting, balance, disposal, tax, two french hens, three
turtle doves...$350.51
