Subject: 87 Syncro

My syncro is still stalling out at highway speeds. 
Usually after 1-2  hours.

I have:

Replaced Idle Stabilizer
Replaced Oxygen Sensor
Installed VW new wire harness to computer

I am getting really frustrated.  It never completely dies just kinda jerks
around and then comes back on.  Could it be the grounding?  Vacuum???


I am open for any suggestions - please help..


This is turning into the Million Dollar Van.
