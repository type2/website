&gt;Could some kind soul provide the 'phone and fax  numbers (and email

&gt;Their VW products are sold in the UK but by the time they get to the 
&gt;end-users, quite a few hefty margins have been added. eg the Westfalia roof 
&gt;seal retails at around 80 pounds sterling - say $125.
&gt;
&gt;I'm hoping that they will supply direct, and cheaper.

1(800)247-3202

But that probably won't do you any good so try:

(310) 325-0005
(310) 325-9733 (FAX)

I bought their roof seals for a late bus westfalia but before before I got
around to doing the roof, Fritz got some free body work from a drunk driver.
He's still sitting in front of my house waiting for the insurance comapny to
tow him to their inspection facility.

Good Luck,
Glen
