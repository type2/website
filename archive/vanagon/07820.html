Subject: Re: Temporary rust fix advice

David Schwarze recommends wire brush over sandpaper for James Brill's rust.
Better yet in my experience is a black disk of almost-petrified sponge on a
stick.  Don't know a brand name but you'll recognize it from this description.
I always have 4 or 5 on my pegboard, in various states of newness, paint- or
grease-contamination, and wear.  They share two advantages of wire brush over
sandpaper:  don't tear, and you cut with the edge rather than the face so it's
easier to control.
