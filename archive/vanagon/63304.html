Subject:      vanagon syncro

Where in the North West (US) are the Tristar Syncro's available?  Are
they imported via grey market or can dealers order them?  Are they still
in production or did the Eurovan replace them (hope not).  Truly a well
layed out site.  I Bookmarked it and will return often.  Thanks.

Ed
