Subject: Re: mpg on 87 syncro

&gt;&gt; I have an 87 syncro with 120K miles.  I am getting 15 mpg.  My question is
&gt;&gt;  -- is this normal???   Normal or not can I do something to improve it.  If
&gt;&gt; not, can I put an extra gas tank so that I don't have to stop for gas every
&gt;&gt; 200 miles.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Here is a data point for your question:
&gt;86 syncro, 120k miles, 37k on complete engine rebuild with new heads,
&gt;all new FI sensors and injectors.
&gt;
&gt;Avg mileage: 17mpg, highest: 22mpg, lowest: 15mpg.

I typically get 20 mpg with my '89 (85k); that's mostly driving country roads,
little city. I can set cruise to get 22-23 on the highway.

My '81 started losing power and efficiency at around 160k miles when the
catalytic converter became partially blocked. New converter fixed that.

Oh, my '81 ran on 3 cylinders for awhile when the Brazilian spark plug
cap sprung apart. My mechanic replaced them all with German parts and
purged his stock of the Brazilian-made ones.
