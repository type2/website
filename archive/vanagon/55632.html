&gt;I just checked on this at the VW dealer in Fargo, ND and they show a rear
&gt;sliding window in natural aluminum color.  I stoped checking on it when
&gt;I found the price was $650 retail.  If the right rear window would have
&gt;been available I may have checked into it further. I have a Westy which
&gt;the rear cabinet would make it difficult to open and close a rear slider
&gt;on the left side.

yup. and they make ONLY the one side. :(  i check into this for my bus ...
wanting to have sliding rearmost windows. but having only one side didn't
seem like it would be worth the money. :(
