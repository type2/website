Subject:  Mid East Camping Trip?

Tom,
       I got the details of your trip from the info Derek Drew reposted.  Do
you need reservations because I have a huge graduate school paper
and would hate to commit. But on the other hand I would love to get out
of town.  Also if I were to come I would have to leave late due to that
viscous traffic on 66 in No. Va. Please e-mail me with more info or call
me at 703-685-6772 (work in Crystal City, Va). Its hard for me to get my
e-mail because it is located at my home office in Annapolis, Md but I will
try to stop in there tommorrow evening.

                                              Patrick Flynn
                                              75 Campmobile
