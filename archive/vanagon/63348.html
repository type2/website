Sean,
Time to hit the junk yards.
It can be fun.
Are you ready for a short road trip.  Get some friends together and lets
roll. How about Chattanooga or Cades Cove this weekend?
Tazewell,

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; You will not believe what happened today!
&gt;
&gt; I was working on the '81, I first raised the front and put it on
&gt; jackstands, then let the front down and raised the rear.  I was giving the
&gt; van a good inspection from the underside.  That creeper that my grandfather
&gt; donated makes it much more enjoyable!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I had already let down the left rear.  I was letting the right rear
&gt; down when all of a sudden, POP! and the van went down about an inch or two
&gt; really quickly.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;That can't be good&quot; I thought.
&gt;
&gt; I peeked underneath and found no signs of anything broken, so then
&gt; proceeded to crank the jack.  However, I noticed that my cranking was not
&gt; being translated into downward motion on the jack.  Well, now I knew what
&gt; broke.  I could also not crank the jack up.  Closer inspection revealed
&gt; that the vertical screw which does the raising and lowering had broken up
&gt; at the top, where it attaches to the gear that attaches to the other gear
&gt; which you turn with the handle.
&gt;
&gt; So now I was stuck.  I had no way of cranking the jack down and I could not
&gt; remove the jack as the van was not lowered all the way.
&gt;
&gt; I thought quickly and went to my place of employment (using my brother's
&gt; car) and borrowed a hydraulic floor jack from them.  That did the trick, I
&gt; was able to raise the van enough to get the damaged stock jack out.
&gt;
&gt; The stock jack is now scrap metal.  It's not repairable.
&gt;
&gt; So I need a Vanagon jack.  Be aware that the jack for a Bus will NOT work
&gt; with a Vanagon.  The Bus has square jack ports while the Vanagon has round
&gt; ones.  The Vanagon jack part number starts with 251.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to get this ASAP, as I am now going to be paranoid about flat
&gt; tires.  I have a good spare, I have a great lug wrench, but I don't have a
&gt; jack!!
&gt;
&gt; Any help here would be greatly appreciated!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Sean
