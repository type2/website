&gt; ok. so the left coast is getting tooooo many. if all you dudes and dudettes
&gt; from the shake-and-bake state will tell me your relative location within
&gt; california (north or south), i'll make the changes. but you are gonna have
&gt; to tell me ... cause i don't know where all those suburbs are and i don't
&gt; have a map here at work. :)  i know where san fran and san diego and l.a.
&gt; are, but i have no idea where many of the others are.

Joel, as a transplanted Southern Californian who now lives in the North 
-- don't bother. It will just start another riot.

&quot;Why can't we all just learn to get along?&quot;
