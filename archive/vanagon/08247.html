&gt;2.  Rear Foglight wiring and rear lens ass'y modification.
&gt;2.1 Does existing harness have wiring for rear fog?

no. most regretable, but no.

&gt;2.2 Where and what color/diam/code is this wiring at both ends.  EG Rear of
&gt;Brick and Under/behind dash/fuse panel.

most any colors you want to use. the fog light is wired through a relay and
fuse/circuit-breaker to the battery (or suitable take-off on the back of the
fuse box ... there are some un-used power taps that can be used, but you'll
still need to fuse the light separately).

&gt;2.4 How did you modify your rear lens ass'y to accept a reflector for the
&gt;center red position and how did you incorporate the additional bulb
&gt;mounting hardware for the 32cp rated bulb?  I suppose I could find a
&gt;trashed ovloV and rig up something but I'd rather consult the
&gt;net.vanagon.oracles.

i thought of this, and got a spare rear light assembly from a junkyard to
scope it out. without nearly destroying the assembly, i couldn't find any
way to get the reflector into the assembly. also you'll need to rig an extra
ground lead into the 'printed circuit' back (the part that the wiring connects
to) ... and for that, you'd likely need a few more 'spare' assemblies.
i was trying to gain additional running lights on both sides, but it didn't
look like it was gonna work out.

then i thought about simply adding an additional complete assembly on each
side. but the metal work involved in getting the things mounted looked like
a real chore, so ...

&gt;2.5 Or if not 2.4 did you mount a Cibie or Bosch rear fog, if so where?
&gt;Wiring questions apply here.

i put the Cibie red rear fog on the driver's side, between the stoplight
assembly and the license plate/access flap. correct positioning front-back
on the bumper is critical because of the size of the light (5&quot; round) and
the big rear hatch ... the square Bosch might be a better choice. mine clears
the rear hatch, but not by much; and i had to mount it over as far to the
left (driver) side to leave room for getting stuff out of the rear of the
bus.  oh yeah, they are on TOP of the bumper (below didn't look too good).

wiring is pretty straight forward ... two wires (power, ground) from the
light, run to the front of the bus. power goes into the relay. ground to
the battery ground strap connection. power to the relay comes from the
battery through a Cessna 10-amp circuit breaker (well ... it SEEMed like a
good idea at the time). and the switch is just a the 2nd-position of the
3-way pod-mounted VW fog-light switch. i think it is supposed to be the
other way round (1st position: rear fog; 2nd position: front fogs), but
i decided to reverse them. so i can turn on the front fogs, THEN the  rear
fog.

while you are back there, you might consider a rear-facing clear fog ...
as a dash switched backup light. it is soooo much better than the normal
backups! you can actually see to drive backwards. :)
