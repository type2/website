 The engine is running very rich during idle and haphazardly hesitates to
 accelerate from a stop.  These symptoms have resulted in.
 
 1.      hesitation from stop to first
 2.	hesitation from first to second (happens less frequently than #1)
 3.	high hydro carbon emissions readings
 4.	high carbon dioxide emissions readings
 5.      very bad gas mileage.  
 
 Dealer stated that it'll cost $320 total for the fix...  I have some
 questions on the dealer's proposef fixes.
 1.      sticking throttle valve ($6.00 cleaner &amp; brush, 118.00 labor) 
         Q: Can just anyone find this throttle valve and clean it?  How
 hard is it to locate and remedy?
 
 2.      seeping (seaping?) fuel line #3 ($22.00 parts, 78.00 labor)
         Q: Not yet leaking, but at this point seeping.  Any dangers in
 replacing this thing?  
 
 3.      $79.00 Diagnosis fee
 
 Main questions:  If you were me (a person who's not really too
 knowledgeable yet... book's on the way from KevinS though... would you
 tackle this project yourself and be able to do it in 1 to 2 hours? with
 minimal danger?  Kind of worried about the fuel line since fire and fuel
 equals possible boom :-)  
 
 More stats on &quot;me&quot;:
 1.      Can do oil changes on the 84 vanagon... woohoo
 2.      replaced the coolant reservoir myself!
 3.      replaced alternator myself! 
 These are the extent of my minimal expertise.  Can I perform the first
 (throttle valve) and second (fuel line) myself?
 
 Thanks y'all!

Me thinks your problem is a bad O2 or temparature sensor.  A bad throttle
switch will not cause the above conditons.  I would also make sure that all
the grounds are good. I would definately repalce the leaking fuel system
parts.  Do not attempt to repair those crimp ends.  There could also be
another problem but check those basic things first.  Also check that the fuel
pressure regulator does not have a ruptured diaphram.  Check by disconecting
the vacuum hose. If there is any fuel there at all, the regulator is bad.
