                                    Breadloaf Dreamin'


My wife wondered if she could use the Rincon Rocket for grocery shopping, as
in right now.  I give her a flat stare but she wasn't joking.  She really
likes the thing.  Seeing me come in all greasy last night, she probably
assumed I've fixed it.

&quot;It has holes in the pistons.&quot;

She considers that for a while before making a gesture like a conductor
asking for more volume.

&quot;That's not a good sign,&quot; I explain.

&quot;Pistons are those round things that go up and down?&quot;

I've explained how engines work and nod, happy that she's remembered.  

&quot;Can you fix it?&quot;

Another nod.  She doesn't like nods but detailed mechanical explanations
cause her eyes to get glassy.

&quot;But not today...&quot; she coaxes.

Shake my head.  &quot;It needs a new engine.  And the front suspension is shot and
the rear suspension has to be re-set.  It's got bent tie-rods and no rear
brakes and the booster has a big ding in it and I've never worked on this
type of bus before.&quot;

The glassy look slowly fades.

&quot;Plus a few electrical problems.  No turn signals.  No antenna.  And the
radio itself probably doesn't work.  One of the knobs is missing.&quot;

No radio brings home the enormity of the repair.  &quot;I guess I'd better take
the truck.&quot;  Her Ghia is too small for serious grocery shopping.  She doesn't
like to drive the '65 bus; too hard to climb into.  She sighs, shakes her
head.  &quot;No radio,&quot; in a tone of profound wonder as she gives me a peck on the
pate and goes off to buy groceries in the truck, which has turn signals and a
radio and brakes and can be steered and stopped and started and climbed into
just like a real car.

Whoever did the lowering, bondo'd a louvered panel over the lower front sheet
metal, moving the turn signals to fixtures inset into the front bumper with
blobs of bondo.  The wires were pulled through an ungrommeted hole and
shorted to the bodywork.  Nor does the machine have headlights, although
there are a pair of them installed.  It has early bug headlights, artfully
attached with sheetmetal screws.  The early fixtures are installed so the
cool looking lights are cross-eyed; the Rincon Rocket could not legally have
been driven at night.

I can't tell if the front spindles are lowered or if the previous owner just
pulled the leaves from the torsion tubes, but the ball joints are shot which,
along with the bent tie rods, makes the question moot.  I'll have to go
through the front end.  And the back end, too.  I assume they merely
re-indexed the rear torsion shafts, chopping off the rubber snubbers.  With
185/65 tires, the vehicle sat so low the frame accumulated a serious case of
road-rash.  

Couldn't drive at night,  lowered to the point where it would drag on
anything larger than a cigarette butt, the Rincon Rocket was the ultimate in
cool rides, with its snazzy paint and custom interior and non-functional turn
signals and cross-eyed headlight fixtures and burned-up engine.  Cool.  

Locally, there is another cool breadloaf.  Equally low, fitted with chrome
rims and tires about as thick as skid marks, I see it lurching around town
now and then.  Its cool looks have won lots of prizes, it has even appeared
in a couple of magazine layouts.  Since the engine is all chrome, the owner
thoughtfully removed the engine compartment hatch so everyone can appreciate
the beauty within.  Of course, without the hatch the compartment is unsealed,
the engine spends all its running time breathing its own effluvium, readily
overheats and must be trailered to the car shows.  Another really cool ride. 

The Cool Syndorme is typical of much of American car ownership.  Shiny paint,
lots of chrome and mechanically unsafe.  Big hat, no cattle.

Aside from a couple of brake jobs and minor engine repairs, this is my first
intimate breadloaf experience.  Compared to a splittie the later bus wins
hands-down for better brakes, a heavier frame and the four-joint rear
suspension.  Once I repair the damage inflicted by the Cool Syndrome it will
be interesting to see how it handles, compared to an early bus.
