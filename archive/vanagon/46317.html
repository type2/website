Subject: Re: Westfalia tent setup

&gt;
&gt;For whoever uses a similar tent, there is an easier way to assemble it:
&gt;
&gt;1) Park the van in position for the tent setup;
&gt;
&gt;2) slide the tent rubber moulding (you can add a little dish washing soap to
&gt;make it really slippery) into the raingutter so that the tent hangs down the
&gt;side of the van (you neither have to move the van nor the tent frame for it,
&gt;right?);
&gt;
&gt;3) sort and partially assemble the poles, crawl underneath the tent and lift
&gt;it up gradually by setting up the frame right in place;
&gt;
&gt;4) even with a tent for a good sized trailer camper (and the typical bunch
&gt;of loose tent poles that you have to match up), this procedure requires a
&gt;maximum of 2 people (and I once in a while did it alone), and takes about 10
&gt;minutes. It helps if you color-(bar)code (w/ tape) the matching ends of all
&gt;tent poles.....

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I can set up my tent alone: make the
frame (okay, so it's harder with one person, but not impossible), then hang
the tent on it. Then, with both the bus and the tent stationary, sort of
&quot;twist&quot; the rubber onto the rain gutter. I'm not sure how to describe this
process, except that I don't slide it (never even occurred to me to slide it
until reading this thread, as a matter of fact), I just kind of rotate it
down and over the gutter, six or eight inches at a time.

Sorry if this is only confusing; I meant for it to help...
