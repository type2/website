[What Happened to Dan??]

Thanks for noticing. :)

I left McMullen &amp; Yee publishing late last year to go into interactive
multimedia for a company in Irvine. I still love VW's, but after 10 years
of writing about them it was time for a change of venue. Don't worry, you
may still see something VW-related from me in the future.
