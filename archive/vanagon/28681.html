&gt;&gt;&gt;The motor bolts right up to the later tranny...

Please note that there is a length difference in inputshafts
of the tranny between a upright and a pancake engined Bus,
it's about 17 mm.

I once got away (for a while) with bolting a 1800 in a '77, originally a
1600, i seemed OK, but after a while (less than 2000KM) the clutch disc spun
on the tranny's input shaft.

Also, the input shaft will not be seated properly in the pilotbearing,
resulting in rapid wear of the inputshaft bearing and oilseal and/or inputshaft
breakage.

If you really wanna do this, you could swap the tranny as well, or do some
research on German flywheel/pilotbearing adapting devices, they are available,
but i think it's easier to swap the tranny since that's only 16 bolts, 2 nuts,
1 (3 if you have backup lights) connector(s), a clutchcable wingnut, and a shift-
coupler to loosen/tighten.
