&gt;Subject: Installing a tape deck into 69 bus
&gt;Thought I had this one wrapped but JC Whipme didn't carry it any more. I need
&gt;to put my radio-tape deck in my 69 camper. Any suggestions as to a source for
&gt;an installation kit. The radio hole is already cut and I just want something
&gt;that will hold well and look ok. Any ideas? I don't know if bug solutions
&gt;would apply.

if the radio hole is the 'normal' size of today's radios, you can get most
any size radio/cassette/whateve to fit ... as long as the front panel is
no bigger than the 'normal' size. that is, the rear part of the radio can
be bigger than the hole.  i had this sort of setup in my old 71 bus and in
my 73 bus ... it was a huge JVC tape tape, that i had to install by removing
the glove box and pushing it through the 'radio hole' from the back. the
face plate-thingie helped hold it in place, but i mounted a little metal
bracket to the back of the beast to help support it (it was really rather
large). once everything was in place, you really couldn't tell it was any
different unless you looked under the dash.

be sure to measure first, however ... cause you don't want something SO BIG
that it interferes with the windshield wiper arms.
