Subject: Re: Five Year Dream Car Pick

I'd like a VW THING (Safari) - turbo diesel, four-door convertible,
with collapsing front wind-shield, limited-slip differential, push-
buttom (i.e. on-demand) 4-wheel drive), ABS, SRS, roll bar, side
impact beam protection, electric motor for the ragtop, and last,
but not least:

2 wings stored in the side that suddenly jet out ala 007 when you
want to be airborne!

and

the model that converts to an amphibian-car with the mere push
of a button.

Anyone know where I can get depth and altitude gauges for cars?
