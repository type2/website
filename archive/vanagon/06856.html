Subject: Thanks one and all


I just want y'all to know that you guys are great.
Terrific.  Stupendous, even.  Every time I've posted
a query, (more often than I post answers to someone
else's query, I fear--not many of your problems line
up with my limited expertise) I get a hell of a lot
of good answers, and invariably a grin or two to go
with them.

So thanks.  Especially to Joel, whose storehouse of
VW knowledge is vast, and to Gerry for putting up with
the rest of us.  Y'all are fine folks.  Even Ric  ;)

crazy to get caught up)
