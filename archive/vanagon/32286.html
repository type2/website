Subject: runningboards and nerf bars

Hi Volks,
  I noticed the post about running boards and nerf bars.  I remember
reading awhile agon the the Hot VW's that there was a brush guard available
for the Vanagon. It came complete with all hardware to mount it to the
front bumper,crome style, it also had optional headlight guards and winch.
The winch mounting plate came standard and you could mount fog lights in
that location if you didn't need the winch. The company that made it also
made other interesting goodies for the Vanagon and bus.  If my memory
serves, Mark McCulloch at Pop Top campers 1-800-248-2719, sell them or
knows where to get them.  You can also check with Hot VW's it ran about 2
years ago.  Good luck.  If I find the old issue in my collection I'll make
a new post.
