&gt; Tom, you didn't mention weather you checked the oil level in your

&gt; all I needed was to top off.

Yes, I did check, and all was OK.


&gt; I did run a '77 Rabbit for a long time
&gt; without lube, but found an additive (can't remember the name) that
&gt; quieted the whine and I had no problems. Drove the car another 40k (163k
&gt; total) and sold it. Met the new owner two years later and he didn't
&gt; mention any problems. 
 
Steve......I assume the additive was something transmission-specific?
