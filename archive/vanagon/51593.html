Subject: Re: Bad luck on '84

&gt; Can anyone recommend something for the stomach for when you leap on an '84
&gt; Westy in &quot;excellent shape&quot; that supposedly has 35k original miles on it
&gt; which turns out to be bulls**t and the price goes from $4500 to $5000 before
&gt; you complete the deal as the owner has had the transmission rebuilt suddenly
&gt; but has no warranty as a buddy did it and then the first time you fill the
&gt; gas tank it spills out all over the pavement and the dash lights don't work
This sounds all too familiar to me. A year ago, we signed and paid 
for an '83 which spilled gas the first time it was filled, then 
proceeded to overheat badly as I was driving it back to the dealer 
the next day. Luckily I put a stop payment on the cheque while the 
dealer &quot;worked things out&quot;. I did some checking and found that 
selling a vehicle with a leaking or non-functioning fuel system 
component is AGAINST THE LAW in this province under the motor vehicle 
act, and carries very stiff penalties. This law also applies to 
individuals selling a car. Laws are no doubt different in your area, 
but the fuel system is a safety item, and you may be covered somehow. 
If so, small claims court may help get at least some of the repair cost 
back. In my case, since I had already stopped payment, and the dealer 
could not fix things to my satisfaction, I just walked away. But had 
it become necessary, I had the number of the local police who have 
the authority to deal with MVA violations.

&gt; and the speedo doesn't work and ALL the brakes need replacement and the
&gt; second time you use the zipper in the pop top it completely comes apart in
&gt; your hand (on your first camping trip during a thunderstorm) and people keep
&gt; listing what look to be much better deals all over the country and now the
&gt; back-up lights either don't work at all or they stay on all the time (making
&gt; people behind me VERY nervous) and now we should all feel guilty since VW's
&gt; were invented by Nazis anyways?????  
&gt; 
&gt; KB-'84 Westy, the &quot;Brown Beast&quot; (on bad days) but I love her anyways and all
&gt; the postings to this list have made me feel much better since misery,
&gt; especially with a healthy dose of humor, loves company, and I've gotten good
&gt; answers to all of my questions.  Anyone ever notice the &quot;stubborn
&gt; expression&quot; (I know, it's anthropomorphic) on the front of a mid-80's VW van?
