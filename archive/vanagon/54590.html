&gt;Buy an anti-freeze tester for the type of coolant you are using i.e. a
&gt;regular tester will not work on Seira brand. Then check the protection
&gt;offered by the mixture in your vehicle. You should be able to figure out
&gt;how much you need to drain and replace  with straight anti-freeze. 

&gt;Good Luck

My recommendation is to not use straight anti-freeze.  A 50-50 mix will give
you better protection plus we have seen problems with straight anti-freeze
&quot;working&quot; on aluminum parts.
