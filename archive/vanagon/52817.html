Subject: Thetford Porta Potti


	To Laurence Johnson and list:

&lt;&lt; Can anyone on the list tell me where I can buy a Thetford Porta Potti? &gt;&gt;

   Sears has a unit called Pak-A-Potti 6000 manual flush, catalog# 259.73647,
which I suspect might be manufactured by Thetford.  It's what Jo &amp; I use.  Since
the larger units have about the same footprint as the smaller ones, we chose the
larger.  The freshwater tank holds 3.2 gallons and the holding tank capacity is
6.1 gallons of black water.

   You needn't bother with special toilet paper.  Any paper can be tested using
a couple of squares in a glass of water.  After about 15 minutes, gently stir;
it should break up easily.  Special &quot;biodegradable&quot; holding tank tissue won't
pass this test, and costs quite a lot.

	George
