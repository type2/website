Subject: freeing frozen brake adjusters, WD-40

	Sarah,
	WD-40 is admirable stuff, but its not a penetrating oil. 
What you want is a product like Liquid Wrench or the equivalent-
probably in a squeeze can, not a spray can. WD-40 DOES have fair
penetrating powers, but its not made for the purpose. A penetrating
oil is *thin* to an amazing degree- very low surface tension, goes
into the smallest cracks and keeps going. The point is for the oil
to find its way down the threads and around any corrosion, dirt, etc. 

	A day's soak in Liquid Wrench has freed a lot of frozen old
bolts for me, and not just on VWs. &quot;Topping up&quot; the frozen part
every hour or so seems to help. Trying to move the adjuster star
with light taps of a hammer sounds good too- try both ways, you're
just trying to fracture the rust on the threads. 

	Do you plan to re-use the drums and shoes? You could use
a propane torch to heat up the drum and perhaps the thermal expansion
would break it loose... goodness knows what effect this would have
on the shoes, or the slave cylinder. Probably bad, and I've never
done this so don't try it on my say-so! Trying to get the torch to
heat the adjusting star sounds like a better place to start, though
again, I've never done this.

	All,
	remember that WD-40 was invented to displace water from the
surface of the very thin stainless steel fuel and oxidyzer tanks of
the Atlas series of rockets. Stainless steel is fine when exposed to
air, but CAN corrode in an oxygen-free environment, such as under
a water drop. WD-40 was the 40th formula they tried. Its not really
a good oil, though people use it as one. Its not really a good solvent,
though some people use it as one. You CAN spray it on a wet distributor
and it WILL 'dry' the points out- that's what it was invented to do.
Mostly I use it as a solvent, which its ok as. Just wipe it off 
afterwards. 

	Bill
