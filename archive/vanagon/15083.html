&gt; &gt; My heads and gaskets were replaced 20k miles ago at 133k miles.  I just got 
&gt; &gt; word that VW is willing to cover 80% of my cost of gaskets that just went 
&gt; &gt; out. So that says 20k miles. I'm also told that new gaskets are available 
&gt; &gt; as of six months ago which are better. I have a 1985 Westphalia.
&gt; 
&gt; I just called TWO dealerships in St. Augustine/Jacksonville area, one 
&gt; said that the deal was only for 1990-1992 vehicles.  The other guy said 
&gt; that he hadn't ever &quot;heard of such a thing.&quot;  He then told me that if my 
&gt; head gaskets had blown I could expect to buy a new engine because &quot;with 
&gt; all that corrosion you'll start breaking things, snapping bolts.&quot;  
&gt; I would LOVE to hear any SOLID proof concerning the money back (who get 
&gt; it, why, where, who can do the repair).  

	Well I can say that I have proof.

	My 1985 Westphalia camper has been in the shop at ANTONION 
VOLKSWAGEN dealership in Sunnyvale, California over the past couple of 
days. I took it there with recently described symptoms including no 
coolant in refill/expansion tanks, temperature lamp and gauge topping 
out, etc. The dealership confirmed that the gaskets needed replacement, 
did the original work on my heads a while back, and offered me the 80% 
payment from Volks./America today. They also are the source of the 
statement that a new gasket became available some months ago which is 
supposedly better. I did not have to resort to a threat or reference to 
FTC or BBB arbitration stuff. They started off saying they suspected that 
VW/America would put up at least 50%, and finally came back with 80% on 
it, particularly in vew of having done the heads about 20k miles ago.


&gt; ALSO, what about that guys statement on corrosion?  B.S. or IHNSHO?
&gt; chuck

Good question.    Can anyone else illuminate on this?
