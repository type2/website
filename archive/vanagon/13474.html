Subject:      stuff on gopher

by the by, if any of you do NOT have access to Gopher software (or don't
yet know how to use it to get to things), and you'd still like to get some
of the stuff from the list ... if you'll let me know (by direct email),
i'll try to get the stuff and send it out directly.

if you don't know what's out there, and would like to know, let me know. :)

joel
