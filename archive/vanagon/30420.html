They help a little bit, mainly with defrosting. You should perhaps first 
make sure that there are no obstructions in the channels. Main suspect is 
the large black paper duct under the bus; in my case the inside lining 
peeled off and was pushed forward, pretty much blocking the air flow.

Then check for leaks. You may also want to insulate the ducts. Finally,
you should know that those inline fans can be obtained for as little as
$20 at boating supplies stores. (Boats use them to vent the fuel tanks
before starting up.)
