&gt;Has anyone also noticed small childrens fascination with old Busses?  
&gt;It always makes me happy to see them stare and smile at me.

The teenage mutant ninja turtles have a bus, 'member the Sweet Pickles ad on 
the USA channel, bus in there.   Scooby Doo, the mystery machine (not a vw 
but its all the same to young uns).  Also look how friendly they look, big 
&quot;eyes&quot; and a big smile.
