Subject:       VW Stuff secured?

&gt; this was a run made for a convention or VW gift shop or something.  If any 
&gt; of you would be interested, please let me know.  I'm sure the items would be 
&gt; rather inexpensive (under $10 or $20, probably $3 - $5 for most items).  I 
&gt; just want some for myself and would pass extras on at the same price I paid 
&gt; (+ shipping).  Let me know soon, as the stuff will probably be gobbled up 
&gt; quickly.

Paul,

What ever happened with the load of VW stuff?  I'm sure there are 
lots of list members (me included) who are still interested!
