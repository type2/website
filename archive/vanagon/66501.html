   Next time you fill the tank up it will unstick itself. This has
   happened  to me 2 times now after I have been off road.

&gt;      My trusty Westy Syncro developed one of its first problems.  After
&gt;      filling up with gas in Hayward, Wisconsin (slow fill) on Sunday and
&gt;      driving for 100 miles back home the fuel gauge stayed at full.  When I
&gt;      turn the Westy off the gauge does drop to Empty.  After restarting,
&gt;      the gauge goes to full.  I know that my Westy Syncro has been a
&gt;      constant 20 m.p.g. vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;      I haven't had the time (have to work on Monday) to check it out.  Has
&gt;      any one had this problem?  I'm going home after work Monday to look
&gt;      this over, any words of wisdom would be appreciated.
