&gt; This was purchased this in 1990, and we paid $455 CDN for the awning, 
&gt; $39 CDN for the bracket kit.  I'm not sure if the address or phone # 
&gt; is still current.  Maybe if any list members are  in Edmonton could verify 
&gt; and possibly supply a fax #, and current pricing,  that would be great.

Hi Gang,

Well Norseman still manufactures the awnings, but they do not sell directly 
anymore.  They sell through the RV stores and are the best by far.  I went and 
looked at them last night and they are *very* nice.  If you phone Noresman 
thay will give you names or resellers.  Their number has changed to 
(403)451-6828.  I went to Gil's RV and looked at them

If you call Norseman they will give you several names of RV stores outside of 
Edmonton.  They distribute all over Western Canada.  The prices are close to 
the same.  $456.00 for awning and $40.50 for the mounting bracket.  With 
conversion to US it will be about $20.00!!!  *grin*  :-)  I'm just bitter 
because I just bought some US money for a vacation.  It cost me $1.39 CAN to 
buy $1.00 US.  sigh....

Cheers
Tony
