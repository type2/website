&gt;Derek,
&gt;
&gt;We ordered the Syncro in March, '91, picked it up on Euro Delivery in June 
'91, 
&gt;and the sticker indicates a production date of September, '90.  Under the 
&gt;original sales agreement in effect in March, '91, it was my understanding that 
&gt;we had a 24,000 mile/24 month warranty on the whole vehicle.  Unless there is 


Many many years ago our Euro delivery Westy ('71) came with 12mo/12,000 mi. 
warranty when Canadian delivered ones had 24mo/24K mi! Maybe they're still 
doing this?  tim s.

Canadian dealers are now offering a factory 10 year power train warranty on 
all VWs, this could be a major deal if a Eurovan Syncro came available. 
Worth the price of admission.
