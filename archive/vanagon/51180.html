Subject: BA6 in a wasserboxer

Folks, I was reading my Vanagon Bentley ( the one I traded a perfect Vanagon
windshield for ...a windshield that I only paid 40 bucks for I might add...)
tonight and was drooling over the Eberspacher BBW 46 section with all it's
digital readouts, clock, and such (only the Canucks get to have that
luxury.......eh?.... hosers!!   :&lt;)  ), and I turned over to the aircooled
Vanagon BA6 section and looked at the setup for it on that model of van.    Then
I looked at the setup for the BA6 on the wasserboxers. It's the same unit, it
just looks like the air circulation blower has a flexible hose going directly
from it to the air intake hole rather than having a &quot;Y&quot; fitting where the air
coming from the heater boxes and the air coming from the blower join before
entering the furnace, as on the aircooled Vanagons.  It just looks like I need
to get a stock heater hose off a aircooled Vanagon that runs from the gas heater
up to the dash air blower motor. There does look like there is some sort of
control flap in the heater-to-dash hose on the wasserboxer BA6 equipped models
that there isn't on the aircooled BA6 equipped models. I would imagine that is
probably to keep the front heater core heated air from traveling back down the
gas heater hose when the gas heater is not in use. 

This may be easier to do than I thought!!!!!

looking forward to a BA6 in my wasserboxer,

chris
