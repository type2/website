Subject: Re: How not to change your Oil!

BTW, I've been a Pennzoil SAE 30 man since the day I bought the bus, 
and yesterday all my parts place had was Castrol 30.  I bought it.  I 
still feel uneasy about it.  My only experience with another brand 
oil was the fiasco with Valvoline Synthetic.  ACK.   Anyone else out 
there running Castrol?  Good?  Bad?  Ugly?
- - - - 

i'm a castrol type myself.   Ive sent in enough rebate coupons on cases that
now they send me the catalog for clothes etc.   They have jackets in XXXL,
but they don't have  Spinner dresses with the castrol logo embroidered on the
front.    :(

btw, what a hassle with the oil change.  I take muirs advice, one hand
halfway up the wrench for 10mms.    Ive been paranoid about sptripping bolt
holes, as i have done that .    You don't want it too loose, or too tight,
but just right.
