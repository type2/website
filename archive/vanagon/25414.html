&gt;&gt; '84 Camper Westphalia (sic), 5 spd.
&gt;&gt; Dean of Kirkwood  966-0303
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Five speed? Wow! Does this include reverse or is it a diesel?&gt; 
&gt;DC

I was curious too, so I called them. Asked them about the 5-spd and they
said &quot;sure.&quot; As if it was the most natural thing. Btw, they want $6,930.
130,000 miles. They have no shame.
