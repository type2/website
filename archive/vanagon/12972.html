&gt; wondering if they were used to somehow hold down the little seat that goes 
&gt; there (you know, the one that looks like a footstool).  I guess it could 
&gt; also be for some little bracket that would help hold up the counter that

On my '71, it's to hold the footstool in place (the stool has a leather
strap and buckle attached to it).
