Jeff (Central Florida),


I just bought one the other day and paid $26750 cash for it!  Now I live in
Portland OR and don't know
prices around the country but there is a service (telephone) that gets you
the best deal (wish I could lead you to it).  Also, when looking around at
late model used ones, we found that Westies in excel condintion with a lot
more miles than yours (100-120k) were selling for10 to 13k.  I think you
could get alot more for your 60k miles 89 than that (depending of course on
the market where you live).  Anyway, I think the guy's trying to ____you over.

Hope this helps,

Art
