Subject: Points keep breaking!!!

Hi Gang,        
         Here we go again.  Yesterday after a day of freeway driving
         going 65-70mph steady my points (Bosch) break where the filiment
         rides on the cam.  This is the second time now in a month or 
         so...the first time was when I drove up to Monterey from LA
         again going at 65-70mph.  My '71 bus runs a fairly new stock
         distributor.  

         Has anyone else had this problem with Bosch?  Are there better
         quality points?  I'm thinking it's time to go CDI and get rid
         of the points altogether.

         Martin
