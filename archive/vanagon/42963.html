Yes, BRIGHT White. You really need to install it through the resistor that
turns down the dash lights, but it is probably 10 times brighter than my
speedometer, so you could use a seperate resistor switch.

Subject: another oil temp. gauge question


BTW, on the 2-1/16&quot; VDO oil temp gauge, what color does it light up at night
? Is it white light to match the rest of the dash??

I'm going to mount the gauge in the dummy plate.

Thanks everyone,
Sean
