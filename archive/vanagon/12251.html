Subject: NON-VW, but computer(UNIX)-related question...

Ok, for all you computer-literate people out there:
On a system here at the UW, the only termcaps supported are those for
the DEC/ALPHA operating system (which it is.) My question for all you
sysadmin-types out there: I have a file that contains my termcap (For
a Wyse50) and I want to point the setenv, or set command to this file
using the TERMCAP, or TERM variable. (Do I correctly understand this?)
Normally, the sysadmins would do this, but I'm under the impression
they're a bunch of unhelpful morons who have better things to do. And,
unfortunately, I let them know this one day. :) Now I have to learn
everything myself, which is probably a Good Thing (tm), but slow. Any
helpful pointers will be appreciated.
