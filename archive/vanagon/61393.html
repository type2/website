From: &quot;R. A. \&quot;Pete\&quot; SELLERS&quot; &lt;sellersp_at_midmonet_dot_net&gt;
Subject: Circle-The-Great-Lakes Tour IS ON!!

Some of you have watched (read) my ordeal, getting &quot;The CONESTOGA&quot; back
on the road and road-ready.

Well ... We're on the road, fit and eager to go.

I'm still &quot;smarting&quot; from the pain ($$$) but I've moved 'The CONESTOGA'
over 500 miles in a rather quick &quot;shake-down&quot; cruise. I even hooked
'Pete's &quot;Play&quot; THING' to The CONESTOGA and towed up &amp; down hills for
over 100 miles ...

All seems fine. We are now about to depart from Fort Leoanrd Wood to
Springfield, MO (about 90 miles one-way) with the THING in tow...
joining The JUNE-BUG Jamoboree. Then we'll return.

A few of you have voiced &quot;IFfy&quot; decisions about the 'tour'.

Seven days from now, my family and I will be enroute.

Hope to hear from any of you with definite plans to accompany or join
us. If not ... hope all of you will have a great summer!!!

As of next Friday, I'll be completely off the &quot;NET&quot; until our return
from 'The TOUR&quot;.

Regards,
--
