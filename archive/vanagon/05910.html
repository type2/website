Dear Pete Sellers and anyone who wants a .pcx file,

Sorry, I have a mac, so I don't &quot;do&quot; pcx or jpeg.  Unfortunately,
I don't have a picture of me in digital format, but I CAN
give you this ascii one.

I look exactly like this guy, except that I have longe blonde
hair, shoulders, and I don't wear glasses.
