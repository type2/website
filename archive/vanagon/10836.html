Subject: 73 for sale/parts

This won't be of much interest to the majority of you, just the few Brits on 
the list. I have just been offered a 73 Devon camper for 300 quid, which 
looks like a bargain. The owner has just bought a 76 bus (for a steal) and 
wants to get rid of the old one quick. He saw my corner of the office, 
plastered in bus pictures, and left me a note so I went to look at it 
yesterday. It looks pretty solid, has new front arches and good doors 
although it needs a rear corner and paint (in primer and has purple and 
white splattered interior) and the engine needs a rebuild. The interior is 
wild purple and pink material, its got Mondeo front seats, a good pop-top 
and a westfalia tow-bar. I am tempted to buy it to fix up and sell on but my 
own bus needs all my spare time right now. I could also buy it, strip it for 
parts and scrap the shell, but it would be a shame to see a fixable bus meet 
such an end. Anyone want it or interested in any parts off it? (Marcus, are 
you there?) If I don't buy it it will probably be scrapped since the owner 
isn't interested in fixing it or breaking it.
