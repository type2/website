I added a couple more pix to the barndoor page, thanks to Dave Easterwood.

If you get rejected by the server, just try again - NetCom is too cheap
to spring for the extra machines to support more people, or real WWW, for
that matter...

I'm looking into a new provider, 'cause I'm kinda gettin' into this HTML
thang...

Also, you bus experts out there:  If you have any tidbits of info to
contribute, let me know!

One more thing:  What is the URL of the &quot;techie site&quot;
