&gt; ..sorry, I missed the beginning of this thread, but something similar
&gt; happened to my '78 Scirocco a while back at about 110,000 mi.  I took
&gt; the odometer apart myself and *carefully* applied some superglue to the
&gt; nylon gear (it had split so that it formed a 'c' instead of an 'o', an
&gt; thus no longer followed the odometer axle as it turned.)  That was 3
&gt; years and 40,000mi ago and no prob since.

The problem with doing this is that because the gear teeth on the cracked gear
have spread apart, in many case they won't line up with the mating gear.  Over
time the broken gear just chews up it's opposite member so that you wind up 
having to replace both of them.  Better to just replace the broken gear in the
first place.  You got lucky, Joachim.
