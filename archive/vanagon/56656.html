Subject: Additional Seating for Westfalias

 I am looking for an occasional spare seat (in other words removeable).  I
am hoping to get a rear facing seat(s) that would go back to back with the
front seats.    I have checked with several other enthusiasts who have told
me about the factory 5th seat but I feel there are more options.

Has anyone any ideas on this?
