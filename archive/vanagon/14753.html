&gt;In an effort to boost the ailing dollar vis-a-vis the ever-healthy DM,
&gt;President Clinton, in cooperation with VAN2, has declared today 
&gt;&quot;National Trade-In-Your-Volkswagen Day&quot;.  The announcement came early
&gt;this morning from the breakfast nook in the Oval Room.  &quot;Don't miss this
&gt;opportunity to get rid of the various Volkswagen products that may be
&gt;cluttering up your garage and driveway,&quot; said Clinton in a prepared
&gt;release.  Clinton promised significant tax breaks to any U.S. citizen
&gt;who trades in any Volkswagen vehicle in exchange for an American-made
&gt;one by midnight tonight.  VAN2--Volkswagens Are Nightmares To Work On--
&gt;is a Tuscaloosa, Alabama based organization.

Did anyone say &quot;April Fools?&quot; You can't fool me. Clinton doesn't work weekends.
