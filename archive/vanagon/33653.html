Subject: oven cleaner

	Caustics will discolor cast aluminum, like trany cases
and engine cases. If they're filthy to start with, discolored
but clean metal may be an improvement, but it's not 'stock' appearance.
Acids have the same effect- I suspect if you want a new appearance,
you have to clean however you can and then polish with steel wool.
Noxious solvents like Gumout or paint-remover won't hurt metal directly
but they're nothing you should rinse down the drain.

	I've had fair results with elbow grease, lots of
orange hand cleaner and a stiff-bristle brush. I've also used
green plastic pot-scrubbers and plastic putty knife. You won't mistake
the results for new, but they're clean. I hate working on dirty
car stuff- in fact, I decline to do so at any opportunity and either 
1) clean it 
OR
2) get out of working on it.

	I'm paranoid about the effect of dramatic cleaning chemicals,
or pummice, etc, on seals, so I go pretty easy around final drives,
the ends of assmebled engines, etc. And try to rinse in a way that doesn't
drive water and crud into the seal.

	Bill
