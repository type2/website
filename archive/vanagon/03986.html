Well Joel I am a wannabus, a camper.  I subscribed to this list to learn 
more about VWs and which year to buy.  I still dont know yet.  I woul 
dlike to spend about $ 5K give or take.  I want to explore more of 
California, so hillperformance is a must.  ALso I dont have much time or 
money to fix things so reliability is a must.

Any pointers ?
