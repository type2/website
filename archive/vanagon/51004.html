Vanamaniacs,

 Three vehicles begin an incline on a four lane state highway at roughly
the same speed and time. The vehicles are:
	87 Vanagon Syncro Westy
	Tractor trailer pulling a multi-ton yellow earth moving machine
	Geo Metro(three cylinder) w/ three adult passengers
Whom reaches the summit first?

Glad to have my Westy back(another story for another day)! Even if it is a
dog!(or maybe it's a turtle)

Peace Out      R.

87 Syncro Vanagon Westfalia
92 Syncro Passat(G60)
Both Titian Red!
