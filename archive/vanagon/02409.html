&gt;My creative juices are a bit stymied at this time,
&gt;..but in view of my suggestion that
&gt;Martha pose in a thong bikini thingie in front of her vanagon for
&gt;VW T&amp;A, and her offer of wearing flannel....could someone come
&gt;up with a song using the Beatle's &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Yoko Ono in the nude!!!! Hell, I'd rather see Martha in flannel!!!
&gt;
&gt;Ric
Yep, Ono!!!  Not a pretty pic, especially while singing...
BUTT!  I have Come up with a THREE verse ditty of Martha My Dear....

Martha my dear,
Inspiration lady of the brick tour, please,
Show me your knees.
1
Turn that key now, you silly girl,
Tour into the unknown!
When you find the map is of Mexico,
Don't despair, navigatiors will be all around you,
Silly Girl...
2
Just two months on the road with you,
What a tale we will tell!
There'll be parties each and every night,
Treks into the great north white,
And flannel,
Pretty girl...
3
Watch that shower, you silly girl!
See what you've done?
When you find yourself in a broken Brick,
Don't get out, the mechanics will be all around you,
Silly girl...

Martha my dear,
Though they say plaid boots enhance your figure, please,
Show me your knees.
.....
Don't forget grease.....


What does that last line mean?  Well, it rhymes with 'Don't forget me...'
And I'm sure she won't.
