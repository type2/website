&gt; &gt;On this subject, has anyone noticed, generally, if your air-cooled runs
&gt; &gt;cooler in rainy (although not necessarily cooler) weather?  Perhaps a Rube
...
&gt; this is not so &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; as you might think. ;)  NASA and the electric
&gt; company up in north alabama found that if you put a very fine mist onto the
&gt; evaporator coils of a housefold air conditioner, it drastically improved the
&gt; heat transfer and made the a/c more efficient ... i.e., used less power to
&gt; cool the house better. so they rigged up some little dinky thing that had
&gt; a thermostat to tell the squirter/mister when to run.
&gt; 
&gt; that's been many years ago, and i haven't heard anything about it since ...
&gt; anybody know what happened to the idea? maybe it rusted the a/c?? :)

The A/C in my apartment is mostly aluminum, I think this is worth a try. 
I still have the specs it came with, says here- Mosture Removal: 3.2 pints
per hour.  Maybe I'll set it up so it drains into the mist water bottle...
it'll feed itself.  Hmm, the water'll probly get pretty dirty, maybe I'll
put a filter between the bottle and pump. 

&gt; and in the southwest, years ago, weren't there some sort of Evaporative
&gt; Coolers for houses?? that used something like that to cool the house (instead
&gt; of a compressor system a/c)??

I had one when I lived in southern Calif...  They were kinda effective in 
*dry* heat; when humid, it just got more unbearable.
 
&gt; running the mixture rich: the new Cadillac Northstar engine management
...
&gt; the oil (cause it will be VERY diluted with gasoline by that point!! not ALL
&gt; the gasoline evaporates ... some of it washes past the rings and gets down
&gt; into the crankcase).
&gt; 
&gt; now THAT's Rube Goldberg Engineering!!! :)

...and it also sounds like engineering by committee!  (&quot;Sure the oil will 
dilute, but if there is an increased engine seize rate, we'll sell more 
motors!&quot;)
