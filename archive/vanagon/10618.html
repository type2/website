Subject: GNATT question

Hi everyone,

David Schwarze had asked me to help him organize the Missouri stretch of
this summer's Great North American Transporter Trek. So I thought it might
be fun to meet local Type 2 owners and clubs in St. Louis. For example, I
was thinking about contacting the organizers of the bi-annual (?) Busses
by the Arch event. Please let me know what you think of it and whether you
have any reservations.

This raises a related (and maybe equally silly) question: should I feel
free to extend an invitation to those non-list-members (whom I don't know)
to join us on the GNATT? After all, isn't it a sociologically valid
statement that, often, groups like to preserve some form of exclusiveness?
If this does not apply to the vanagon-list, great! In that case, how would
you all feel about advertizing the GNATT to all other Type 2 clubs in the
U.S. and Canada as well?

On the plus side, we may actually be able to get a LOT more Type 2s on the
road and the more, the merrier. On the other hand, it would no longer be
the Vanagon-list tour (you know, that socio-cultural stratum of people
with this dual VW/computer geekiness and who know about flannel). So please
think about it: do you feel that an extension of our invitation would be
constructive or destructive of your GNATT vision?

Thanks,

Sami
