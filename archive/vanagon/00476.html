Subject: Re: Vanagon Subwoofer

OK, so I can put subwoofers under the seats. But don't I have to calculate
the exact area dimensions of the cavity and then calculate the Q somehow to
determine the ideal woofer? Also, is 1/4-1/3 cubic foot too small a space to
do justice to any woofer, regardless of Q calculations.
