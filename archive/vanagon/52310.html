Subject:       Re: Will Vgn middle bench seat fit Westy? (was: Jump Seats)

&gt; On a similar note, can the middle bench seat from a regular Vanagon be fit 
&gt; into a Westy?  At quick glance, it looks like the middle seat tracks might 
&gt; still be under the Westy carpet. But I'm not sure if the bench seat is too 
&gt; long to fit between the sink/stove cabinet and the sliding door.  If it did 
&gt; fit, you could just clamp it in when you needed 2 extra seats, and pull it 
&gt; out relatively easily when you needed the room instead, just as in a 
&gt; regular Vanagon.  Then again, I've never seen it done before in a Westy, 
&gt; which might be indication that it doesn't fit.  Has anybody tried it or 
&gt; measured it?

The seat tracks are there, covered by aluminum strips screwed in 
with a couple large slot head screws. If the seat can be slid toward 
the door, it might just fit...

Anyone want to lend me one to find out?  ;)
