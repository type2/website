Subject: Poptop resto work

I wouldn't work with fibreglass.  It's very messy and expensive in 
consumer quanitities.  What I have had good success with is hiring the 
local pick-up track canopy manufacturers to do the work.  They have 
all the tools, the expertise, and the workspace.  If you can find a 
canopy place in your area then talk to them and find out how much 
they would charge you to do the work.  When calculating the value 
versus doing it yourself don't forget to factor in three critical 
factors which always surface when working with fibreglass;  mess, 
mess, and itch.

p.s. Canaopy manufacturer - not reseller.

Also stay away from boat fibreglassers.  Boat work tends to cost too 
much due to the nature of the typical customers income levels, and 
they don't have the coloring experience (unless you want white ;-))
