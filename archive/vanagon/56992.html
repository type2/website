Subject: Re: Core charge for Vanagon Transmission?

&gt;   I think that there are times that a core or fee should be expected.  In
&gt; Tom's case it sounds like the person he was dealing with, waited to inform
&gt; him of the Core fee, but either way the core is worth money.  Every person
&gt; thinks a core is worth a different value, I value a Vanagon core at about
&gt; $300.00 depending on what the symptoms were prior to the removal of the trans.

Ludicrous, perhaps from a specialty yard that knows the worth, NEVER 
from your average jo-blo scrap yard unless like Ron said only for 
scrap value.  I'm not saying that the dead tranny is not worth $$$ as 
Kyle suggests, I'm simply saying you would never pay a core on 
something like a used tranny or engine out of a normal yard.  Never 
seen it in 15 years of dealing with junk yards, I'm sure some people who 
have been dealing longer would agree.  I can go buy a used Vanagon 
tranny for $250 tops, no core in any one of 3-4 semi-local yards, 
something I may be doing soon as the '81 is getting a lot of R&amp;P 
noise in 1 and 2.  Your average wrecking yard would have no idea what 
to do with a Vanagon tranny core if they took it in.
