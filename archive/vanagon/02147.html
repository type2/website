Subject:      round and round we go ...

uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. hey beavis. has anybody checked, like, on how many miles
and stuff this trip is gonna be? :)

while playing with a copy of Automap (admittedly not the brightest program
around), i came up with this:

start in Took-a-looka, Amabala (natch!).
west to Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Los Angeles
north to San Francisco, Portland.
east to Billings, Pierre, Minneapolis,
south to Kansas City,
east to Columbus, Hagerstown (MD),
southwest to Knoxville, and back to good ol' Took-a-looka.

(obviously NOT the most efficient route or anything like that. just a SWAG)

anyway, 7345 miles, 115 hours continuous driving, and about $400 in gas
money (based on the wildly optimistic parameters in the program of 65mph
on the interstates and $1.10/gallon for gas. ha!)

now, fudging the factors a bit based on experience, we would likely be
closer to 8000 miles, 160 hours driving time, and about 500 gallons of
gasoline (or diesel!) ... say, $600 in fuel money?

just thought i'd put some numbers out for those of you cogitating doing
the whole trip! :)
