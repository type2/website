&gt;  Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Is it really that hard to get mechanics that know the water-cooled engines?
&gt; 
&gt;  A suggestion: see if you can find a mechanic *first*. If you can, then 1)
&gt; You'll know this isn't a problem while you're home, and 2) they will be
&gt; able to help you check out any vans you are interested in.
&gt;  If you can't then you might be better to avoid the watercooled busses.

I second this opinion.  One of the main reasons I decided to recently
purchase my '84 Vanagon was the fact that I had found a garage that works
on nothing but VWs, I both liked and trusted the owner(Bob) of the shop and
his rates are very reasonable.  I also own an '85 Golf and had been using
this garage for its maintenance prior to purchasing the Vanagon.  Before
I bought the van I took it in and Bob spent an hour going over it up on the
rack and taking it for a test drive with me.  I knew the van had some 
mechanical problems before I purchased it, but I also had the piece of mind 
knowing that I had a place to take it that would do good work and treat me 
fair.

If you happen to have a copy of an April issue of Hot VWs check out the 
feature on Bob Hicks and his Notchback.  Hicks VW service is where I take
my Golf and Vanagon.
