Subject: Re: Get yer LIST STICKERS here!!!!!!!!!

&gt;&gt; Chrome mylar material (i.e. shiny silver)
&gt;&gt; Exterior sticker ( because you can stick an outside sticker on a window, but
&gt;&gt;   you can't stick a window sticker on anything else. I also decided against
&gt;
&gt;Yuck.
&gt;
&gt;Prefer inside stickers a huge amount.
&gt;
&gt;Hope others deluge you with the same opinion.

        I just take the stickers, and a roll of scotch tape, out to the
bus, pop the hatch, do the job clean and right. Still there after 2 years,
will still come off real easy when/if I want them too.

Peace,
