Subject: gen questions. '87 syncro

Hi!
   I just purchased an '87 Syncro GL and I have a few questions some people
might be able to answer.  First of all, the gentleman who sold it to me
said it had a factory 2.3 L engine, but I was told by other sources that
the largest made was a 2.1L.  What is the case?
   I am also interested in hopping up the car a bit.  I spoke to the guys
at busboys, and they told me that they tried to get neuspeed to make a
&quot;chip&quot; with no success.  Does anyone have suggestions of other easy
upgrades that might increase horsepower?  I am also intersted in doing some
suspension work.  Is it possible to lower the front end of a syncro (so
that it is level with the rear), and are there any goodies available, such
as sway bars?
   Finally, I really like the looks of the FUBA antenna (like on 16v
GTI's).  Has anyone ever put one on top of their Vanagon?  Is it worth the
effort?

Thanks for the help!
