The most common failure is the speed resistor.  It is located behind the 
drivers side head light assembly.  The fan should come on whenever the AC 
compressor is engaged.  At 300psi or so, the fan should go to a higher speed.

Subject:	Radiator/Condensor fan

After replacing a burst a/c hose on my '86 westy, I took it in to have th= e 
system charged. The shop discovered that the condensor fan is not coming on. 
They let the pressure go up to 400#, but the fan never came on.  Does anyone 
have any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this electrical problem? The 30A 
fuse is intact, but that's as far as I got.  The shop says it could cost as 
much as $200 for them to troubleshoot, a cost I would very much like to avoid.
