Derek,

I had the same problem with my '86.  Check the computer unit under the rear
seat, mine was shorting out against the side of the van. Fixed with a piece
of cardboard between the unit and the van. My '91 has plastic spacers.

&gt; 
&gt; Last night while driving on the highway my engine cut out for a second or
&gt; two, I was turning about 4000 rpm. It felt like the igniton was turned
off,
&gt; this has happened twice before in the last six months. There were no
&gt; indications before or after. This is an '87 Syncro. Anybody have any
ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
