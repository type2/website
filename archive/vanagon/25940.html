&gt; Sorry, Harvey-- I wasn't aware of a non-profit institution doing private
&gt; insurance. All the insurance companies I have dealt with, or heard of,
&gt; have been for-profit companies.

In California, every time I do a comparison shop, 20th Century is the best
deal. BTW, their prices got higher with the passage of prop 103, not
lower. But they still seem to be the best deal.
