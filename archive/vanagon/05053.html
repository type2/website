For me the issue is the randomness of the gauge. There is no definite
point at which the gauge will always say .5 gal left....I have lowered
the tank to replace the handbrake cable and it is a messy and difficult
job. Replacing the sender is a no go at this stage. The second gauge
sounds interesting - how much do they cost? DC --
