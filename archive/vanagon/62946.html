Subject: Anchor bolts in an '84 Westfalia

In the camper the rear bench seat box frame is fixed to the body via
three shiny brass 13mm bolts.

I'm tempted to extract one of these bolts, insert an anchor hook that I can
tether my child's carseat to, and then reinsert the bolt.  Looking
underneath the camper I don't see any bolts coming through the floor
near where these ones go in.

If I remove the bolt will I be able to easily put it back in?  Or will I hear the
sound of a nut falling away into the depths and then end up with a loose
rear seat?    Will I need a longer replacement bolt (the anchor is about a
computer diskette in thickness)?

Your help would be appreciated.

B.T.W. - Volkswagen of Canada/America told me over the phone that
'84's were not designed for the extra tether of a Canadian carseat.  They
also would not recommend a workaround because they didn't want to be
held liable.
