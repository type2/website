&gt; Are you meaning to tell me that you grafted an ENTIRE roof?  *JOY*
&gt; 

from right below the drip rail on up.  I sectioned out the old roof with 
an air chisel, then removed the rest from the old spot welds.  The 67 
roof I trimmed flush, right under the drip rail and ground it down flat

&gt; I've been looking for someone that has done this first hand.  I've got a 
&gt; '66 Westy, and I've got a '65 deluxe roof that I want to mate to my westy.
&gt; 
The bad new is that on the dlx snrf's you should really had a 
re-inforced, double floor.

&gt; Now, real slow like, tell me in detail how you took the old roof off and
&gt; how you put the new roof on...specifically talk about spot welds, the front
&gt; vent stuff, and the rear hatch stuff.  What did you use to put the new
&gt; roof on...spot weld gear?  MIG?  How did you get the new roof watertight?
&gt; 
once I had it in place I had to slowly weld the front on with the MIG, 
eventually having a continuous bead around the front which I should try to 
grind down a little bit.  On the inside I had to get creative and I 
tack-welded the skins together.  Not pretty right now.  The part from the 
front seat back I was able to clamp using a make-shift series of 
Vise-Grips and a comealong.  I jacked up the middle of the bus to head 
off any body sag then I merely welded up the old spot weld holes from the 
bottom and placed a continuous bead where it looked like it needed it.  I 
will be using seam sealer to finish.  A tricky part of my project was 
re-arranging the rear hatch area as my 59 has a small cargo door and the 
67 has the big one.  It wasn't too bad though.  A few waves as it is hard 
to get the thing flush on the sides, but I imagine the whole thing is 
stronger than it was stock.  The Panel looks kinda cool with the red body 
and a white roof.  I still have a fair amount of rust repair though.  8-)
