Subject: Re: Belly Pans, Bus Grand Tour, Names

This is a catch-up message on a number of subjects.

&gt; &gt;What are these belly pans?
&gt; 
&gt; As Mr. Bozo was my first Type II, I thought they were standard issue for
&gt; several years.  Not til much later did I crawl under another bus and see
&gt; the floor!  The pans have a cross pattern pressed into them from corner to
&gt; corner (like commercial a/c ducts) and are just welded on from rocker
&gt; panels to front and rear of cargo floor cross-braces.  The entire cargo
&gt; section is sealed.

This sounds like an after-market addition to me, but I am not sure. John,
(or anyone else) do you know if these were VW-issue?  I liked the idea a lot 
the first time I read it, but five minutes pause leaves me confused.  
-First, I wouldn't weld anything to the belly, I need access too often.
Screws would be OK tho.  
-Second, the mid-section rust problems on breadloaves (my only experience)
appear in the rocker panels, floor, and behind the front seats at the
corner with the floor.  This belly pan sounds like it might (a) protect
the floor and rocker panels from salt spray or (b) trap the salt spray
against them for year-round rusting.  
-Third, the pan would definitely help with heating, IMHO, as there would be
a &quot;dead air&quot; space established around the heater tube and under the floor.
Any other opinions on this? 

Second Subject:

My brother just got orders to transfer from Schweinfurt, Germany to
Tooele, Utah, so instead of flying to Europe on vacation, I am driving
&quot;around the block&quot;.  From DC to KC, Denver, Tooele, and Seattle. Thence we
procede down 101 to LA, hang a left and back via Albuqueque, Houston, New
Orleans and Atlanta.  I figure this for May 25-June ??.  I have been 
ignoring the west coast grand tour, as I knew I would not be able to make 
it, but now it seems that forces are converging.  Do I lap the tour?  
Martha, David, what are the plans so far?

Third Subject:

After lurking on alt.fan.terry.pratchett way too long, my bus has 
picked up the obvious name, &quot;The Luggage&quot;.  Definitely some sapient 
pearwood in its construction, and there's way more stuff in there than it 
looks like.  Hope I'm not treading on too many toes (ba-dum BUM. CRASH)
