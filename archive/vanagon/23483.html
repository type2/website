&gt;&gt;From a magazine: The Car Collector &amp; Car Classics; October 1995
&gt;RESTORATION TIP, NOT - Joseph Aaron tried an innovative approach to make
&gt;adaptions to his car at his home in Wesley Chapel Florida.  Aaron needed
&gt;to bore a hole in the exhaust pipe of his car.  Lacking a drill, he tried
&gt;to shoot a hole in it with his pistol.  He was hit in the leg when the
&gt;bullet ricocheted.

yessir, that old .45 caliber, semi-automatic, hand-held portable drill. :)

now, supposedly there was this fellow from Anniston, AL who blew a fuse in
his pickup truck, and lost his headlights. well, sir, he didn't have no
fuses in the glove box, but he did have his .22 rifle in the rack behind the
seat. :)  so he gets a .22 Long Rifle cartridge from the rifle and puts it
into the fusebox. presto! he's got headlights again.

only problem is ... see, fuses get kinda hot. so did the cartridge.
BANG! the fusebox shot him in his foot. :)

if you knew anything about the folks who grew up in Anniston, you'd find that
story very very easy to believe. :)
