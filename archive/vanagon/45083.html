Robert,
My guess is that the rattle is from the metal drainboard that drops down
over the stove is rattling.  Also, it could be the grate that goes over the
stove (this could be loose).  In my '89 Westfalia, I put a dishcloth between
the stove grate and the drainboard to prevent rattles.

See ya,

&gt;&quot;out-of-bounds&quot; for some &quot;netiquette&quot; reason, please ignore and 
&gt;excuse.  THANKS!  I have a rattle, a MAJOR rattle that comes from 
&gt;somewhere around the kitchen cabinet.  I have taken out all the 
&gt;shelves and checked everything I can.  There isn't anything loose.  It 
&gt;sounds like a piece of metal knocking against something.  I am afraid 
&gt;it might be a loose gas pipe or something dangerous.  My regular 
&gt;mechanic gave up right away.  I thought it might be nice to find out 
&gt;if some other owner had had the same problem and what they did.  Again 
&gt;if this is not the correct venue, please ignore.  Thanks much, Robert
