Subject: Re: Rusty Coolant and PS pipes on '85

Well made it to the archives on a friends machine and came
up with the fact that the pipes will likely set me back $130
each in steel from VW, but Parts Place swears the later plastic
replacements will fit and will sell me used for $80 each.  I seek
clarification on this if anyone has actually done the switch,
as actually I may still be able to get them off a locally junked
'87.  It was in a local yard 4-5 years back when I was looking
for bus parts and may still be there if it has not been crushed.
Even if '87 still used steel it should be ideal as it was only on the
road 4-5 years before being wrecked so I'm hoping it's still there.
