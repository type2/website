&gt; I need an owner's manual!  I called around to a couple of the VW dealers 
&gt; here in Metropolitan Atlanta and had no luck.  

I was able to get a new one for my '84 this past spring from the VW
dealer here in Durham, NC.  If I remember correctly the cost was $3.75.
Here is their number: (919) 493-7411.

I bought my Bentley from these folks:

     Performance Specialties      (310) 220-1141
     1158 E. Highland Ave.        (310) 408-1442 FAX
     San Bernadino, CA            open 7 days/week, late on Wednesdays
     8203 University AVe.         Visa/MC/Discover
     La Mesa, CA 91941

The price was $55 plus an additional $5 because my total order was less
than $100 plus shipping.  Substantially less than the $90 list price.
