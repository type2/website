I met a fellow from Arizona named Jim Harvey, who simply disconnected the
spring.  There is a latch, so the spring isn't really needed anyway.  This
bus is full of trick little mods that all look factory.  He also has a
collection of odd trucks like a Puch Halflinger, and an Isuzu truck whose
name escapes me...

Misc. Ramblings.....

: Howdy -
: 
: I've been wondering what other people do to hold down their rear 
: license plate door to check the oil?  
: 
: Did VW get better in later years and actually provide some way to 
: hold the door down?
: 
: I use my foot to hold open the door when checking the oil.  
: 
: When adding oil, adjusting timing, etc. I use a piece of wire shaped 
: for the purpose to hook from the underside of the bumber to the top of
: the door.  I store it on top of the hinge, bent slightly to keep it from 
: sliding off.
: 
: I tried wedging the oil cap between the door bottom and bus back, but 
: this is not an option when checking timing, and it didn't hold the 
: door open far enough for my tastes.
