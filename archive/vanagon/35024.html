Rusty wonders if we will run a similar thread in about a month  re: How HOT
is it? (Phoenix,AZ, USA) Late March through May has a 50-75% chance of
reaching 100F. May through at least the second week of October has a 90-110%
chance of being above 100F.  85F and clear skies today.

Arizonans breakout the ski parkas and flannel regardless of the temperature
in September. This is commonly done just to encourage cold weather.
