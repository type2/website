&gt;Concerning auto stop valves,

&gt;passion! Apparently there is more spillage and subsequent burning of flesh
&gt;from liquid propane! Anyway, I simply replaced this valve with an earlier
&gt;style  which were non auto stop. My '81 Westie had such a valve which was
&gt;easily available at the local RV supplier for  $35.00 you need to replace
&gt;the bleeder valve also which was another $10.00 or so. Good Luck!


  Wow! That sounds much, much better. Those auto-stop valves do have
an awful reputation, that's for sure- I wonder why VW continued to use
the stupid things, anyway... BTW, the fridge in my '85 can run on
battery power as well, but it doesn't seem to get very cold like that-
is there any way to get it to work better, or should I be running it off of the
battery at all (it seems to work fine when I 'plug' the van in)? Oh
yeah, and how long can you run your fridge on a tank of propane (the
tank looks pretty small)?
