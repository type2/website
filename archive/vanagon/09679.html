Note: This is [F]-rated: the word VW is only used once (and gratuitously
at that):

&gt;Sami:  So let me see if I understand.  You will install the heater fan as
&gt;soon as it gets warmer.  There's an old story about a leaky roof that needs
&gt;mending.  Only trouble is that when it's raining the roof is too wet to
&gt;fix, and when it's not raining it doesn't leak, so why fix it.  I
&gt;appreciate the irony here.

Larry: Yes, it is ironic, but what can you do, man? Why catch a cold lying
on the cold and wet parking lot when I can catch it in the comfort of my
VW motorhome? :)

Actually, I'm not driving too much these days. School is in walking
distance and there's a *lot* of salt on the roads. Temperatures are
expected to rise into the low 50s this weekend. That could give me enough
time for the installation before the next cold spell.
