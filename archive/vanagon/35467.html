Subject: Isadora Duncan - thanks!
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

Cheese,

That's fascinating!  I am always impressed with the arcane!

I studied dance throughout my entire youth, and knew all about Isadora 
Duncan, but she was so obscure that it's always surprizing when someone 
lightly refers to her demise. 

What I meant in my reply... was... how many people out there would get 
it? 

Did you just happen to have her dossier on file, or was it for memory? 
:-)

Later!
