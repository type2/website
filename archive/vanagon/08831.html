Yes, I have removed the five bolt flywheel, twice. Both times I used a
standard socket wrench and an extender. In this case the extender was
really the tubing part of the jack which i slipped over the handle of the
wrench. The torque is about 80 ft/lbs  or around there so putting it back
on can be done easily with atorque wrench. The key thing is to use the
leverage of an extension - DC --
