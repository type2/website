Subject: 90 Westy Skipping

Greetings,

Problem:  Van skips or hesitates badly when first started.  Seems worst when
under load.  Once the engines warms up after approx. 5 minutes it seems to
run fine.  It has new plugs, cap and rotor.  The van does sit for up to 10
days at a time without running.  

Although this is not my daily driver,  it will be for a couple of days as my
trusty Volvo, with a 164K, decided it needed a rest this morning. I think I
lost the timing belt.

Any suggestions on where to start trouble shooting ?

Thanks in advance
