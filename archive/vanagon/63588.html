Subject: Volks Cafe

A while back I ordered a used speedo from Volks Cafe (with a repaired
odometer).  I would like the list to know about my satisfaction.

When the speedo arrived, there was a problem with it, but correspondence
with Kyle showed that he was willing to work with me to keep a customer
happy.  The speedo was sent back and repaired.  

Tuesday, my family and I were in the bay area visiting our son and we spent
the day in Santa Cruz.  We decided to stop and visit Volks Cafe while we
were in town.  Got a chance to meet Kyle and pick up the speedo.  

We arrived just as Kyle left for lunch, but he came right back, wrapped the
speedo for travel, etc.  The whole experience was a pleasure!
