Subject: wasserboxer muffler &amp; CAT

To all ye wasserboxer owners,

The new muffler I got from EuroParts has a heat shield brazed
onto it. The old one didn't have one and it's removal was pretty
easy, once I separated it from the CAT. Anyhow, the new one with
the heat shield doesn't have enough room to slide in across the
muffler hangers. So I guess I have to take the hangers off, mount
the muffler to the hangers and then reinstall the hangers, what
a drag :(  The new muffler is heavier than the old one, it
matches in lenght and flange location.

On to the CAT, the new CAT is stainless steel, matches the old one
in length and flange configuration. The only difference is the new 
one is 2/3 the diameter of the old one. Dennis Haynes mentioned 
that this maybe more restrictive and could decrease performance. 
I'll have to install it to see. Otherwise it looks very well made,
I don't recall the manufacturer, but I got it from PartsPlace.

One last thing, to get the old O2 senser off of the old CAT, I had
to put the old CAT in a vise and use a pipe wrench to get the 
sensor off. Chewed up the flat surfaces some but it worked. I 
could have use some heat, but didn't think of it at the time.
Oh well, I plan to use a ton of anti-seize when I put it back 
together, which should help with disassembly next time.
