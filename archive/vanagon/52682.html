Subject: INTERIOR CABINET DIMENSIONS (BLUEPRINT)
Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 07:37:13 -0600

Hi -

As a cabinetmaker by trade I am in search of the dimensions (blueprint)
for the VW Westy interior cabinets.  I believe they can be reproduced 
accurately, tastefully and economically.  The stove and &quot;refer&quot; could be
fitted or omitted per owner wishes.  If there is a list member with
these dimensions or could guide me to the resource for these dimensions
I would appreciate direction.  

At present I've been contacted by several Vanagon owners who would be
interested in new  &quot;professional&quot; looking cabinets they could install. 
Granted, they accept the &quot;non-pop-top&quot; version of the Vanagon but, would
really want the cabinet space and other unique storage / camping aspects
of a Westy.  In addition, those I've spoken with have not had great luck
salvaging a Westy interior via salvage yards.

Having been on the list for approximately a year, I've learned to
appreciate the advice and direction the list members offer to those who
are in need of data, information, kind words, and understanding when
dealing with the uniqueness of the VW Vanagon/Westy/Bus.  Your input
would greatly influence my decision to pursue this venture. 
Constructive criticism is welcome.

Thanks,

Jim
