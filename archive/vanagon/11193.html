     Hi James,
     
     Well over the past 6 or so years I've built up an unbelieveable set up 
     tools for my car repairs, and this is what I would suggest you need:
     
     6 to 13mm (2x10mm and 2x13mm),17,19mm open end/rind spanners
     
     1/2&quot; drive sockets from 10 to 23mm full hexigon, and not the 12 corner 
          ones. My set is made in the US by Buffalo!
     
     1/2&quot; drive extensions 3&quot;,6&quot;,12&quot;,24&quot; and an angle drive.
     
     1/2&quot; T-Bar and Rachet drive
     
     1/4&quot; drive sockets from 4mm to 13mm again full hexigon, with t-bar,    
          extensions and rachet drive.
     
     Flat blade and Philips type screw driver sets ranging from electrical 
     sizes to say 10mm blade (on the flat blade driver).
     
     One of those multi-bit screwdriver sets containing Allen 
     bits,Philips,Flat blade,and other weird bits. Often contains adapter 
     to use your 1/4&quot; drive sockets.
     
     Set of long allen keys ranging from 2mm to 12mm. We have some with 
     ball drives on one end so you can use the key at an angle.
     
     Other tools:
     
     Pair of BIG plyers, pair of &quot;Mole&quot; grips, big and snall pipe (Monkey) 
     wrenches, some &quot;G&quot; clamps, a hard and soft hammer, chisel.
     
     I tend to buy these tools separate because you can pick'n'choose all 
     the various bits. Just make sure you get Chrome Vanadium everything!
     
     Lee.
