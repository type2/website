&gt;     
&gt;     Question is (Thom, Clara etc..) what is the correct set-up between the 
&gt;     heater box and the tube on the body. The length of tube would need to 
&gt;     be about 35cm. Am I correct in thinking that the tube consists of a 
&gt;     flexible piece and a kind of baffle tube or something, any pre '63 
&gt;     buffers know the answer ?

its s'posed to have this big boxy &quot;muffler&quot; looking thing.  I always toss
them because they contain asbestesos.  I use a later bug heater tube, the
big bellows type, and adapt it.  Works great.
