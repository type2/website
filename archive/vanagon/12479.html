Subject: bumper sticker stuff


MaGod!!!!!!!!!  I came home from work tonight and expected to find
50+messages re bumperstickers.  You guys have really begun to
contain yourselves; that's using your brain (WHEREVER it is).

How about if we all simply mount a dried prune on our antennae
with a flannel (made from flannel boxer shorts) pennant-flag
underneath?
