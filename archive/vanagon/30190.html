Subject: 67 type II  FS  in NYC  w/Westy interior

I know of two folks arriving in NYC on Dec. 10 from California in a 67
bus. They have to leave for Austria within a week of arrival there and
would like to find a good home for their bus.
Please e-mail me for info on how to get ahold of them.
You can reach me at STEVEG1720_at_AOL.COM
