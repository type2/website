&gt;	Does anyone out there know the approx prices of a 1950-60 VW
&gt;MicroBus? (I'm not sure about the production dates, but I know it's
&gt;the one with the split-pane front windshield...) :)
&gt;

The prices vary widely.  I bought my '56 Kombi for $400, minus the engine 
lid and bumpers.  The seat was in bad shape, but it was there.
I managed to get it running by putting in a some gas, a new battery, fuel
filter, and sandinf off the distributor contacts.  &quot;Big deal&quot; you say? 
Well, to put into perspective, the bus hasn't been registered since '74!
She started after 30 seconds of intermittent cranking!  I am now in the
process of doing the body and paint work, then will come a new engine,
transmission...

Prices for decent-shape busses and fully-restored ones will vary
by model, geographic region, and the VW-enthusiasm of the seller.
Case in point- a '62 (?) 23 window while back in a VW magazine was going 
for $11,000.  They seem to be more expensive in the rust-free states
(California, Arizona...)

I personnaly know a guy (lucky bastard!) that bought a '55 23 Window for
$500.  It ran (barely) but for that, who cares?

The official production years for split-window buses was 49-67.

I know a guy right now who has a 56 Kombi and a 50 something pickup for
sale.

On any early bus, be prepared to spend some cash on running gear, such as
suspension, and stuff window rubber, wiper blades, light bulbs, clutch,
etc.  Its going to vary widely from bus to bus. The trick is to find the
bus that needs the least stuff for the lowest price!  Remember too that the
earlier the bus, the harder stuff is going to be to find, such as lenses,
door handles, doors, bumpers (there are actually only two styles of bumpers,
and the early ones are impossible to find)

Also be prepared for a lack of a fuel guage on anything before 61 (?).

If you wish to go on about this, please feel free to e-mail me directly...
