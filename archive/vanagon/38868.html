&gt;&gt; Hey all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I just heard on the news that the U.S. Border Patrol is buying up
&gt;&gt; hundreds of old Volkswagen busses in southern California and southern
&gt;&gt; Arizona to be used as stealth vehicles for patroling various backcountry
&gt;&gt; areas along the U.S.-Mexico border looking for drug smugglers.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; They quoted some guy named Vince Claypool, a USBP spokesperson as saying
&gt;&gt; that they were planning to put some sort of big 6-cylinder engine in 'em
&gt;&gt; and modify the suspension to handle better in high speed chases but that
&gt;&gt; the outside would be left as is.  Aparently, they are looking for busses
&gt;&gt; from the years 1968 to 1979 because of their resemblance to Mexican
busses.
&gt;&gt; He said the high ground clearance of the busses is also a plus for this
&gt;&gt; operation (code named 'hipster').
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hmm, I wonder how much they're paying for busses, I've been trying to
&gt;&gt; sell my '73 Westphalia.  And will they sell the busses back to the public
&gt;&gt; when the operation is done?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anybody else heard anything about this?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Yuck!  I can't believe they're going to ruin hundreds of old VW buses
&gt;like that!  
&gt;
&gt;They'll probably sell the buses back (or auction) but the buses will be
&gt;torn to crap by the time the Border Patrol gets done with them.  
&gt;
&gt;I'm really disgusted by this news.
&gt;
