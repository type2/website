Subject: RE: Raise The Rear!!!

Speaking of raising the rear, my 78 is getting tired rearend wise, and has 
sagged a fair amount. Of course the correct way is to remove the trailing arm
plates etc.etc.etc., and realign the splines for the correct squat. Well, I
am self admittedly a lazy s.o.b., just ask my wife. The lazy man's way 
would seem to be air shocks or coil springs to raise the buttend back up.
Any comments on this oh wise ones?? :)
