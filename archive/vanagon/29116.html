Subject: Help - 84 Westy inside sliding door handle screw

I lost the screw which holds the interior handle for the sliding
door on. I will just go to the hardware store to buy a new one,
however I would really like to know the proper dimensions of the
screw.  Does anyone have a manual which would list that part?

Thanks,

BrianI.
