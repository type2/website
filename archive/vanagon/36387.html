Subject: Pulsing when lugging engine....

I am having trouble (potential) with Vroomhilde, the '71 Bus.

When I am lugging the engine, in 3rd or 4th, but even a little 
in 2nd, I get a pulsing sensation, at about the engine speed.
It is not a sound that can be heard, but really only felt.

I dont notice any sounds that sound like the tranny, so I
do suspect the engine. It is terrible in 4th, unless I 
am coasting downhill.

I worry that a rod may be coming loose, the engine has some
respectable miles on it for a cheapo-rebuild. I also 
suspect that the endplay might be a little out of
spec.

I plan on doing a regular timing and valve job this
weekend if the weather stays good. Is there
anyhting that I should check (Mabye a compression check)
while I am all grungy?

Does anybody have a good method of drive-testing or testing
with the engine in the car to see about end play?
Can I test it at the pully?

I need the Bus to be reliable, Gardening season is coming up
and I need to haul mulch, seed, sand, etc. I also need
to get to the Bugout with a boatload of parts from the shed, 
I want to get rid of.

Thanx.
