Subject: Re: 68 vw bus $550 runs &amp; looks great (Concord, Bay Area)



&gt;Hmm, I do not think it has been modified, just rebuilt.  My concern was
&gt;that it was not a '68-'69 longblock which was one of the reasons I was
&gt;considering it.  I would rather buy a used engine I know runs then one from
&gt;a junkyard which I am taking even MORE chances on.

In my experience, junkyard engines are usually there for a reason. If
the yard proprietor will give you a 30-day warranty, say, then that's
a lot better-- but the price will probably reflect it. If he has a way
to let you run it and/or do a compression check, that can help a lot,
too.

Welcome to the world of used-parts buying!




&gt;Well, it did say a valve adjustment had been done 8k ago.

That's a long time-- it needs another one.

Definitely do a compression check on this baby. Or, at least, pull the
center wire and have a friend crank it over. Listen for a brief hiss
as each cylinder rises on its compression stroke-- there shouldn't
be one. It would be nice if you could also do this to a freshly-rebuilt
engine for comparison purposes.

A hiss on the compression stroke, could mean a burned or mis-seated
valve, or maybe a broken ring.


&gt;I will look at the engine again.
&gt;It did say it had an oil leak from the head gaskets.

Uh, Bug engines (incl upright bus engines like yours) don't have head
gaskets; and if they did, there wouldn't be any oil on either side of them
anyway. Watercooled engines occasionally have problems with cracked
(&quot;blown&quot;) head gaskets, which let water drain into their oil, but that's
a different subject.

Upright engines often do leak oil from their pushrod tubes and/or valve
covers. Other points are the crankcase seam and the place where the oil
cooler mounts inside the fan shroud; and the classic place where the
crankshaft comes out of the engine to the flywheel.



&gt;Well, as I said to the owner, unless something major happens I am getting
&gt;it.  From the responses I am getting I am even more inclined to get it.
&gt;Hopefully, the steering problem was mostly due in part to the tire.
&gt;Otherwise a 90 mile tow is NOT in the budget!

What's wrong with the tire? Steering boxes can wear, and The only way
I've heard to get them fixed is to take them out and send them to a
good shop, which can take a week or more while your bus is up on blocks.
The other parts can wear, too, of course, but they are more standard
replacement items without quite the lead time of the steering box.

There is a play adjustment on the steering box, and when it gets adjusted
too far by an overly enthusiastic mechanic looking for a quick fix, it
can cause the steering to bind. This is not only dangerous to drive, but
is also very hard on the steering box. Once the box is badly worn, the
adjustment doesn't do much good-- it's rebuild time.
