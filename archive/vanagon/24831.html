Subject: RE: Attention all '71 Bus Owners


&gt;&gt;Seriously, I ran a 1600 DP with alternator, doghouse cooler, Weber
&gt;&gt;progressive 32/36 carb, and Thunderbird single quiet pack in my '69 bus
&gt;&gt;for several years in the mountains of Colorado. A sweet setup, once I
&gt;&gt;got the idle air adjusted properly (by taking it to someone who knew
&gt;&gt;what he was doing).

&gt;Thanks for the imput...why the single carb over dual carbs?  Did you
&gt; get plenty of low end pick-up?  I'll let you know what the consensus
&gt; is after I get enough responses.

I was in school, it was cheap, my 34PICT sucked, and I'd heard good
things about it. In other words, no GOOD reason. But, I tried it, and
I really liked it!
