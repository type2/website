&lt;&lt; My local VW dealer wanted $259 each for OEM shocks!  I called several
 places and found the same shock, Boge, same part no., for $80 each at
 Discount Foreign, San Diego, 619-283-6086. (I doubt if these guys do
 mail order, but the point is that local parts places CAN help you). 
 They also sold me KYB Gas-A-Just for the rear at $36 each.  
 
 The KYB's on the rear are fine.  The stock OEM Boge's on the front are
 not stiff enough for me.  Koni, KYB, and Bilstein all told me they don't
 make front shocks for the Syncro.  Has anyone found any others? 
  &gt;&gt;

Same thing I found out.  Got the KYB's in the rear and the Boge's in the
front.  And no, haven't found any substitute for the front struts......  And
yes, that front spring can be dangerous.   I ended up having the dealer
install them,  but I bought the struts from a foreign discount parts shop in
Portland, OR.
