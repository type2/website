&gt;GET THE DAMN CATALOG OUT TO EVERYONE ALREADY!!!

&gt;Oh and PS guys I can now get genuine rubber OEM VW CV boots
&gt;for $8 locally why do you guys still want more?

You're welcome to vent, but jim_at_busboys unsubscribed two days ago and won't
be back for at least a month. If you need him to read your message, CC it
to busboys_at_aol_dot_com.
