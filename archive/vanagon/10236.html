I think someone mentioned this once, but I don't know 
if anything came of it -- would it be possible to distill
the text of these manuals and put them on the gopher? Or is
there so much non-text info that this would not add much to
the collective knowledge?

Also, are we talking about the typical Owners' Manuals or special
ones for the Campmobile?

Thanks....
