&gt; 
&gt; Well the crazies have struck again!!!! I have the opportunity to buy an 86 
&gt; Westy Synchro w/55k miles, original owner - third car in fleet, for approx 
&gt; $10k. The body is straight, the interior has hardly been used, etc...etc...
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Am I crazy??? (ok.... as it applies to the above dilemma....)

Well...... No.  You see, you have down spoken the vanagon so openly
on this list (yes it's been a while) and now you're having guilt
pangs for your, ahem, untruths. :)  So now you're stuck with a 
decision that is pretty tough from your point of view because it
means admitting to us, the already enlightened, that you did, in
fact, make a big mistake in your original purchase....  :)  :)  :)

Now, for some real help.  I would make a pro/con list and list out
all of your considerations for both vehicles and all of your needs.
Then see which vehicle fits your profile the best.  This way, you
are making a well researched decision as opposed to an emotional
one.  Now go to your room Ric and don't come out until this is done.

And until your answer is the Syncro, you can't go out and play...  ;p
