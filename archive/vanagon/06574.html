In a previous post, it was said that the wheel bearings don t come out to 
be greased.  It is very easy to remove the bearings.  First, remove the 
driveshaft.  Then, drive out the stub axle, finally remove the snap rings 
on both sides of the bearing carrier.  Now, the bearings will come out!

hope this helps
