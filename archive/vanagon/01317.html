&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I love my Volksie and it's okaaaay...
&gt;&gt; Drive hills and dales the live long daaay...
&gt;&gt; Give it oil and gas and it smiles awaaay...
&gt;&gt; I wear panties and a braaa...   &lt;well, maybe not&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I love my Volksie and it's okaaay...
&gt;&gt; I don't care what people saaay...
&gt;&gt; As I'm passed on the hiighhwaaay...
&gt;&gt; I wear panties and a braaa....   &lt;well, if it starts, why not&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;  I love my Volksie and it's okaaay...
&gt;  People look at me in a funny waaay...
&gt;  When I'm working on her night and daaay....
&gt;  I wear panties and a braaa....   &lt;It's the VW, right? perhaps not&gt;

Hey, this is getting good!  I'd do the one you have Joel, but I
can't for the life of me remember how 'My Darling Clementine' goes.
&lt;shrug&gt;
Joel loves his Volksie and he's okaaay...
Taps on the keyboard without no paaay...
Works real hard on what he's got to saaay...
He wears panties and a braa...?   &lt;Maybe he *is* an AI...&gt;
