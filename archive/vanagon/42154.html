&gt;Go back, tell him you've changed your mind, and want one more drive.  Many
&gt;novice VW drivers often shift from first to reverse until they are used to
&gt;the shift pattern you know.  Fourth to second coming off an expressway is
&gt;also a problem sometimes.  Sometimes it's even hard to know when to shift
&gt;up, the engine is so far away you can't really hear it properly. ;&gt;   I'd
&gt;get the $100 back, no excuses from the weasel. The plane fare is gone,
&gt;that's enough 'learning' for me.  Tim

Well, that's kinda rough on an innocent machine. But you might open the
engine compartment for another inspection. But beware-- if a ballpoint
pen falls out of your pocket, into the little recess where the bottom half
of the crank pulley resides, no one will ever see it, but it will screech
like a banshee next time a potential customer starts the engine. Good
news is, it won't hurt anything or anyone except the pen. What's he
complaining about? It wasn't his pen!

Aah, this is so decadent and childish... but soooo tempting...   &gt;:^)
