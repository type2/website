&gt; I'm an ex-Vanagon newsgroup member (so please respond to
&gt; nickpace_at_rand_dot_org via email) but my friend asked me to see if anyone
&gt; knew where she could obtain what she describes as &quot;the protective flap
&gt; on the driver's side that prevents mud and junk from getting on the
&gt; propane tanks and other stuff&quot; for her '85 Westy Vanagon.  I asked her
&gt; if she meant an ordinary set of wheel well mud flaps but she
&gt; emphatically said no.  The thing she wants is a single special unit that
&gt; is only on the driver's side and whose purpose is only to prevent junk
&gt; from hitting the accessories under the body.  She says that the price of
&gt; a new one is steep.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas where to get one?

Make one.  I did; out of a heavy plastic electronic packing box.  Works
like a charm.  It's stiff enough to deflect small rocks and debris and
gives a little in the wind and for branches and ground debris.
