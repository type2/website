hi

i need help again.  last month it was compression, now we are back to
the main problem -- carb/intake manifold.  i have an 1800cc type 4
with the progressive weber 32/36 DGAV carb.  and i can burn up my
valves in a heartbeat; not all the valves, only those on cylinders 1
and 3.  here are the symptoms:

	1. at idle, if i remove the spark plug wire to either cyl 1 or
3, the idle speed barely changes; yet if i remove the wire to either 2
or 4, the engine just about stalls.
	2. when the compression gets low enough and i need to pull the
heads (this has happened twice now in 10k miles), cyls 1 and 3 are
gray and clean, while 2 and 4 are dark and carbon covered.

this sounds like a vaccum leak; i have replaced the head-to-manifold
gasket (even used different styles), i have replaced the rubber
booties at the other end of the manifold, i have doused every
connection with carb cleaner and have heard no change (at idle).  it
still could be a vaccum leak, but lets put that idea aside for now.

this is my latest theory: the progressive carb has two throats -- the
&quot;main&quot; throat is toward the back of the engine (feeding cylinders 2
and 4?) and the &quot;progressive&quot; throat is toward the front.  both
throats open to a chamber -- sort of the center of the manifold; there
are 4 pipes leaving this chamber, one to each cylinder.  the theory, i
suppose (this is part of where i need some help), is that the fuel
pours out of the carb, mixes evenly in this box (homongenizes?), and
the same fuel mixture goes to each carb.  it seems to me that if the
fuel did not mix evenly i would have the problems i mentioned above.
but when i mention this theory to &quot;people in the know,&quot; they look at
me like i'm from another planet and tell me that &quot;no, that couldn't
possibly happen&quot; because &quot;lot's of people have this same carb&quot; and
&quot;it's a really good carb.&quot;

i got this car with the (hell) carb system already in place, so i
don't even know if it is the &quot;right&quot; manifold.  so i went to a parts
place today to see what the kits look like and immediately noticed a
difference in the center piece of the manifold.  mine looks like a
shoebox with two holes on both of the two long sides, while the new
ones look (from the bottom) like a 4-legged spider -- the four tubes
come more from the center.  to me this seems like a much better
design, but the mechanic at the parts place said &quot;no, your's oughta
work just fine, what you really need is to raise the carb up off the
manifold so the fuel has more time and space to homogenize.&quot;  (he
didn't really say homogenize.)  the other thing about these kits is
that the tubes that run to the heads have a smaller diameter than mine
do.

after all that intro, here are my questions:
	a) do i want to raise the carb?  it is an idea that seems to
make sense, but in the extreme case, i would put the carb on the roof
with a long airtight tube connecting it to the manifold.  this would
cause problems accelerating, i think, and it seems to me that the
further the carb is from the cylinder, the less vaccum the carb
&quot;sees,&quot; and thus performance drops.  in other words, it seems to me
that the carb/engine are designed to such that there is a set volume
of air/fuel between the head and the butterfly valves and all i can do
is mess this up.  (of course the engine was not designed with this
carb in mind ...)
	b) could those of you with a similar set-up (type 4
engine/progressive carb) do me a favor?  grab a flashlight and a
mirror and look under the center part of the manifold and let me know
if it looks like a shoebox with pipes or a 4-legged spider.  or if you
did this conversion yourselves, do you remember the manufacturer/part
number?

thanks.

sorry for the length.
