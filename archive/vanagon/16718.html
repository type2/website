Subject: CV Grease replacements

When the rains stop, I will attempt the CV ritual. 

I was windering what people use instead of CV grease. CV grease
is gurrently going to $3.49 for a two ounce tube! I need at least
two tubes per CV, four CVs per car. Mabye more. Ouch!

What is it about special grease that makes it so '$pecial'?

Is high temp wheel bearing grease a good substitute? I would
use the salt resistive boat trailer type.

How about synthetic moly?

Thanx. (BTW, I searched the archives, but never really found
a good answer. But, It sure seems the consesus is to
use about three times the specified amount. And I will. Gotta
keep what is in there from plastering its self against the
boot, and not sitting IN the joint!)

Every CV that I have ever disassemmbled has had 90% of the grease 
packed into the boot ridges, and like 10% in the CV cage. More is
required.
