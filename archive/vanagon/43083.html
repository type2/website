&gt;Bugs?&quot;  Sounds like a bust just waiting to happen!!! In Arizona it's five
&gt;years in the &quot;joint&quot; (Class 5 Felony) for just thinking about possesion at
&gt;any level -no kidding.  No thanks!~ (even though I understand that there is
&gt;a difference in illegal whatever and hemp products)...  I would be there
&gt;with Krylon in hand and do a thorough &quot;roach check&quot; before I left the lot.

Of course, if you just drove it in Canada where we haven't yet decided
to mount a WAR against a fairly benign plant, you'd be just fine.
I've never heard of anyone getting jail time for simple possesion up
here- more like a ticket, and even that's a farce. If your driving and
using it, then sure, throw the book at em. But FIVE YEARS!!!!
I don't think I'm going to be visiting Arizona (no offence)....
