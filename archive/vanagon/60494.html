Subject: Hesitation problem driving me bonkers!


Hello,
	For the last couple months I have been trying to fix a nagging
problem.  My van hesitates off of idle to about 3000rpm.  It runs fine
when cold, and runs fine when the O2 sensor is diconnected.  It does not
run rich, but HC's are very high.  I have replaced the ignition wires,
distributor cap, rotor, plugs, fuel pressure regulator, O2 sensor (several
times), blue coolant sensor.  I have checked the fuel injector spray
pattern, all engine grounds, vacuum leaks, timing and dwell.  I have used
redlines fuel injector cleaner twice and ran the van straight through the
entire tank of gas.  I do not think that this is carbon buildup since the
engine is new.
	If anyone has suggestions I need to hear them, I am at the end of
my rope and will soon lose it altogether and turn the van over to a
mechanic.  Thanks a lot.
