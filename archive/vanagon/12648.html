Subject: Re: Are there other canucks on this list?

&gt;	Specifically does anyone know of upcoming VW events, &quot;Bug-In&quot;'s 
&gt;etc in the south-central Ontario area.  What about upper New Yrok State?

Hey, there's an annual bug fest of some sort in Kingston each year, usually 
at Lake Ontario Park, right next to KPH (the loonie bin, figures) Been to 
one when I lived there. Look for adverts on telephone polls, it's a high end 
event by gum!   tim s.
