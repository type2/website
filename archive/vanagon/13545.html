So Mark No-frostbite Sabourin says:
&gt; 
&gt;  I live in Ottawa, Canada and the temperatures up here can drop to -20 C (Duh,
&gt; don't know F temp, but it's damn cold) Anyhoo, a safer alternative to
&gt; the propane heater is inline volksie heaters. We used to go ski flying
&gt; in the winter and two inline volks heaters were the only thing that
&gt; would preheat the engine. I.E. one heats the fresh, cold air, while
&gt; the other heats the 'heated' air. One precaution though: don't try
&gt; sticking your hand in front of the second one... Unless of course you
&gt; LIKE the smell of burning flesh... Cheers.
&gt; 

So what is meant by a volksie heater?
