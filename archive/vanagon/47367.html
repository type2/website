&gt;If you look closely, there is still deer hair at the initial point of 
&gt;impact.._dot_can anyone ELSE make that claim about their van??  :)
&gt;
Hey Nancy,
     My van too has deer hair caught in the grill and body seam on the
drivers side.  The deer I hit seemed to want to be hit.  I changed lanes
twice to avoid her.  She ran out of the ditch on my right side of the road.
I swerved left then back right as she made the far side.  She then ran back
accross the highway  I swerved again and she changed directions again!!.  I
hit her as she tried to make it to the far side of the road.  Luckly I had
time to slow down, so the damage was not bad on the van.  A bent bumper , a
dent  between grill and turnsignal, and a smashed fog light.  Tried to find
the deer but she ran/crawled into a dense thicket.  It's been 6 months and
the hair is still there.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
