I read vanagon and only vanagon because
it is specific, informed, and with the
inevitable exceptions of occasional inanity,
germane.  I believe this feature-set is
possible only for topics/groups that are
un-popular and self-organizing.
    
As to rec.autos.vw, I am an agnostic.  If
I weren't an agnostic, this is what I would
say:

    It ain't broke.  Don't fix it.  Tell the
    let's-cut-the-net-into-ever-tinier-pieces
    crowd that a threaded news reader, a KILL
    file, and Evelyn Woods are their saviors.
    Relying on pre-categorization to the n-th
    degree only confuses the unitiated, orphans
    complicated issues, encourages cross-posting
    and gives flamers a new thing to criticize
    other posters about.

    If someone *really* wants to improve the
    signal-to-noise ratio, tell them that it is
    time for them to enter the world of volunteer
    list moderators.
