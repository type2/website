Subject:       Diesel recipies

My brother has run '#2 with the quart of gas'  in emergencies and it 
did prevent him from waxing up.  HOWEVER, he was cautioned that if 
one does go too heavy on the gas their can be disastrous results at 
detonation time.  My brother is a nerdy sort that digs into/gets all 
the info about something when he's got a problem (NONE of the rest of 
us are like that ;-}  ).  Here's his recommendation after extensive 
research:

1.  Run #1 in winter, forget about mixing up 'special blends'

2.  Keep a can of &quot;Siloo&quot; diesel fuel conditioner in the vehicle for the 
inevitable when you get stuck with #2 during a cold snap.

BTW, his 1980 diesel Rabbit is for sale.  ~160K, AC, LS edition, 
fanatic oil changes with Shell Rotella, some body rust.  $800.  Email 
me private.  Oh, I'm in the tundra of MN.
