Subject: WG: Syncro Heavy Duty Shocks And Springs


Hi Derek,
(you are a lucky guy - we didn't bet on some items dicussed in the last weeks. 
It wouldn't have been a fair game anyway as Seikel and SDP are only &quot;around 
the corner&quot; here)

glad to hear that Seikel and Grabherr gave good hints. I hope that the news 
about US syncro enthusiasts will leak to VW AG as well - telling VWoA to take 
better care of you and making them think faster about a future T5 syncro 16''.

But, Derek, do you really think you can really save money by ordering step by 
step. Wouldn't it be better to collect orders for stuff which is not available 
in USA like the wheel-wells, Seikel springs, 16'' rims, or whatever you may 
need. With such a &quot;Christmas list&quot; we could try to get some discount and ship 
it in one block ? Try announcing it on the list or throgh some of your free 
parts specialists.

BTW: I cannot fully agree wit Dan Houg !! Surly reinforced springs will 
enlarge the stress on the body. But as you told me you are loading your 
Vanagon up to three (metrical I assume) tons and VW has cut the 
complete-weight for the 14'' down to 2 300 kg for Off-Road use you simply get 
closer to the &quot;normal conditions&quot; with the stiffer springs.

But Dan is completely allright: it doesn't make sense to use too different 
front and rear springs.

He is right in another point - it's just an opinion.


to the points now:
(...) more likely to get into a duty situation if you go through a commercial 
carrier. Last time I ordered parts from Europe, there was a stamp on the box 
saying &quot;Receiver is responsible for paying any duty&quot; and that was the last 
time I heard anything about it. The time before that, the postman just left 
the box in the hallway of my building here in New York, and I never saw him.

4. The prices:

        Front spring: DM243 each is $135 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $270 the pair
        Rear spring: DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair

        Front shock DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair
        Rear shock DM208 each is $115 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $230 the pair

        So you have a full setup of heavy duty springs and shocks for $1,200 
====
If you do it &quot;backstairs&quot; through the customs you may loose your VAT tax 
refound which I found already substracted in Seikels prices mentioned above. 
(German VAT is 15% at the moment ). You could also try to declare it as 
samples of no commercial value
===
5. I believe it is silly to get the rear shocks, as they are a standard sort 
of size, and it should be possible to find USA equivalents at cheaper prices.
===
Which is true indeed - from that point of view also for the front springs, but 
reverse-engeneering might be tricky because the springs are progressive. 
(Guess we alredy discussed that - did we ?)
===
49 6055 82731 
===
is ok.
===
Dunno what to do with that number, exactly.
===
You need to do some international money transfer - but Seikel should accept 
Master Card at least I guess
