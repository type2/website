I have learned a few things from the recent thread on stripped oil drain
plug holes and what type of washer to use.
I'd like to replace the washer the next time I change my oil.
Are these &quot;crushable&quot; washers commonly available?  Does anyone know the size
, or will I have to go to the hardware store in the middle of
the oil change when the plug bolt and washer are off the bus?  Should the
new one be copper?  
Happy New Year to All.  Its in the mid 50s today in NC!
