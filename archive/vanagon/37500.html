&gt;Un attended accelaration in Audis was BS.  No mater what the electronics
&gt;does, you still nedd to open the throttle to get enogh air flow to make any
&gt;power.  I owned an 84 5000 turbo.  Engine still did not make enough power to
&gt;rule the brakes useless.  This problem was not cause of Audi's losing thier
&gt;resale value.  All the pieces falling off made the car hated.  Especially
the
&gt;power steering system and windows/sunroof.

what about that cheesy Delco A/C controller? and that cooling fan resistor?
 What about the headliner?  It costs $450.00 to do a 5000 headliner while the
same shop charges $150.00 for a Volvo.  The headliner is GLUED in to the roof
with rabbit style carpet glue!  Then, when you remove the old material and
foam, it turns into TAR!  Ever tried to glue something to tar?  You have to
perferate the headliner shell and apply a layer of fiberglass to start over
for a glue-able suface.  $450.00........    No thanks!    

Before 1984, the 5000 was a fairly dependable car.  My wife drives an '81
Diesel (restored)
