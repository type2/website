Subject: Is this kid trained or what!!


My 4 year old Alex (the main reason for purchasing the EV) came home from 
day care with more &quot;refrigerator art&quot; today. One piece was a &quot;collage&quot; 
piece....in the center was a cut-out picture of an EV that was scaveneged 
from a magazine ad. Where or how the school got an ad with an EV, I'll never 
know....

Back to the story...the EV was a white camper. In order to make this picture 
look like our EV (a non-poptop EV/MV), Alex carefully trimmed the picture to 
get rid of the top...yet left the open rear hatch still there....


Needless to say this one is going to the office...to hang next to the beetle 
and split-windshield van pictures on my bulletin board!
