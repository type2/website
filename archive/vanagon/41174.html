Subject: Gerry?

Mr Skerbitz is, i believe, enroute to Wisconsin as we pontificate
away. He has a New (well New to him) and largely untried engine in
his van and could use some good thoughts to speed him along.  He was 
having some mixture problems he was working on until the wee hours of 
the night 2 days ago.

Wish him well (and drop the newsgroup thread for him).
