Tim,

I just got back from a long weekend rafting - w/o the vanagon:( - and 
got your message. Thanks a lot for the advice! I thought I printed all 
the related articles from the archives but I didn't see one authored by 
you. Do you know the heading? I'm planning to start the job late next 
week, but I obviously want to try your head retorquing idea first. I'll 
let you know how things go. Thanks again!

tony
