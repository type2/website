Subject:      Vanagons In Space [F]

Because it's Friday, and because it's time that I delurked, and because
the similarities struck me early and often during my recent introduction
to Vanagon ownership, I hereby present my...

-- Top 10 Reasons That Vanagons Are Like the Space Station Mir --

10. Excellent views out the living room window.
 9. High mileage; a few dents.
 8. Explosions and fire regarded as part of normal periodic maintenance.
 7. Better than the Space Shuttle for trips longer than two weeks.
 6. &quot;Drive only with pop-up top properly locked!&quot;
 5. '80s European high-tech, and other such oxymora.
 4. Tumbles uncontrollably when mishandled.
 3. Air-tight, somewhat.
 2. Cooling system designed by Dr. Seuss.
[drumroll]
 1. Plenty of intrepid adventurers eager to go for a ride, no matter what
    the skeptics say.

Many thanks to the list managers and archivists, and to all you listees
for making Zefram's resurrection quick and relatively painless.
