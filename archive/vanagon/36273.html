Subject: Re: A '59 bus found

Young Ben,

I am lucky enough to have a pile of old magazines entitled &quot;Foreign Car
Digest-featuring Volkswagen&quot; (years 1960-1965 complete). Whoopie 8P you say
and rightly so.  The point is that in nearly all of these magazines there is
an article (that we would consider total sacreligious) covering how to
convert your bus into a camper. Typical are pictures of sabre saws cold
chisels and middle seat removal.  SunDial was one American company who
converted panels into campers that kinda looked like Westfalias.  An older
gentleman that I know used to be a mechanic at a VW dealer in the early
'60's. He said that the dealer would get in palettes of camper conversion
packages. One package per pallete. The dealer would convert the panels per
specifications, cutting in windows and all!

BTW:The engine is commonly referred to as a &quot;36hp&quot; engine possibly what was
considered the &quot;bastard&quot; engine. I think '59 was the year for this engine. I
was the short lived transitional engine between the 36hp and the 40hp engines.
