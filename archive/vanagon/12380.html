&gt;I've got it...sort of taking a cue from Joel's suggestion of a 1&quot;x1&quot;
&gt;square of reflective tape on the back hatch...what we need is something
&gt;&quot;computer&quot; to put on the back hatch, that would be on one hand small...
&gt;and unobtrusive...and on the other hand relatively identifiable...

well ... what about a bar-code label with the list address at the bottom?
in 3M reflective tape, of course. :)  &lt;ever notice that 3M = MMM and if
you put it upside down, it's WWW .... amazing, but true!!&gt;
