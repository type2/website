&gt; Mark, have you been losing brake fluid?  Any wetness anywhwere in the 
&gt; braking system that might indicate a leak in the system?  Wheel 
&gt; cylinders, master cylinders, couplings in the lines?  Check the whole 
&gt; length of the lines, too, since you may have chucked a rock or something 
&gt; up on the logging roads and damaged something.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be freaking if my pedal would drop to the floor every now and then!
&gt; 
&gt; Any other info you could add to your description?  Any other ideas out there?

Tobin,

No loss of brake fluid that I have noticed. I will get underneath and
have a thorough look. The rear wheel cylinders are new last fall. Sean
Stueber says on August 16...

&gt; I had to adjust mine several (about three, I think) times before the problem
&gt; went away.  You problem sounds exactly like mine.  I think the reason is that
&gt; when you adjust them it actually only adjusts one side.  Over the next few
&gt; minutes/hours/days of driving the shoes center themselves and require
&gt; adjusting again.  Give it a try.  Good luck
&gt; Sean Stueber
&gt; 

I re-adjusted the rear brakes 2 weeks ago and proceeded on a 2 week
wind surfing holiday. The rough roads and long freeway sections did not
cause the problem to reappear yet. One other symptom is that the brake
pedal will drop slightly under pressure as if something suddenly
releases, and I can hear a clunk from the rear when this happens
(usually only after a long period of driving without braking).

Thanks for the feedback!

Mark
