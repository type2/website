&gt;Chris Gilbert inquires about price of conversion, which could be less than
&gt;$1000 not including the engine.  The engine itself is going to be in the
&gt;$2000 to $5000 range, higher if you &quot;need&quot; a Turbo or a late-80s engine.
&gt;
&gt;Scary, but note that the engine will hold its value better than the van
&gt;does.  Unless you really blow it up, the engine is always going to have
&gt;a parts value of nearly $1000.

I've seen core motors as high as $2500
