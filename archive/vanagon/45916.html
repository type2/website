Subject: Re: 1986 heater fan dead

&gt;    To the hard core Vanagon Brains; 
&gt;    
&gt;    My front heat fan in my 1986 Vanagon GL is 
&gt;    now blowing fuses and making a high pitch
&gt;    squeeeel when it does run.  
&gt; 
&gt;    Any ideas as to a where I might drill a small
&gt;    hole to add some spray lub to the bearings???
&gt; 
Please post the results if you fix this - my fan now only works about 
once a week for 10-15 minutes, then slowly grinds to a halt...
After removing the fan in my Jetta in about 7 seconds flat, I was 
somewhat peeved to find the Vanagon fan isn't quite so easy...
