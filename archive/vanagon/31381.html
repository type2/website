Subject: Thanks and Merry Christmas!

Thanks to Tim, Joel, Brian, Harry, Frank, SyncroHead &amp; anyone I 
missed for all your info on buying a Westy.

I've decided to hold off on the '87 until after the holidays, partly 
because it's too hard to deal with right now, and partly because I'm 
hoping that ignoring the dealer for a week or more will make them 
reconsider my lower offer...

Anyway, all the best to all of you and your loved ones for the 
holidays. Although I've only been on the list a short while, I've 
found it to be enlightening and pleasant place to be on the net - 
it just reminds me why I love VWs so much!

Merry Christmas!

Shawn
still Westy-less...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
