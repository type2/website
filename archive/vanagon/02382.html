From: ahleatst_at_dataflux.bc_dot_ca (Michael J. Rensing)
Subject: Calling all hosers, eh!

I've compiled a partial list of Canadian list members from David's list of
those interested in camping.  Since the Alabama CPU ;-) hasn't done this,
how about if I compile the Canadian statistics? (If anyone cares.)  Here's
what I have so far:
Bell, Alistair		Victoria, B.C., CAN		
Carment,Dr Dave		Ottawa, Ont., CAN		
Condelli, Frank		Ottawa, Ont., CAN		
Hoekman, Ted		St. Johns, Nfndl, CAN	
MacGrady, Ralf		Ottawa, Ont., CAN		
Miller, Steve		Guelph, Ont., CAN
Rensing, Michael	80 Westfalia L         Victoria, B.C., CAN		
Wigley, Neil		Windsor, Ontario, CAN	

Send me your name if you're not on the list, and everyone send me your
van(s) model and year.  I'll ask for and post updates once in a while if
there is any interest, or just forward the info to Joel to add to his stats.
Should I sort this by owner name, or by province from west to east (or east
to west)?

Michael
