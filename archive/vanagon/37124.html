on this list???  not hardly.
 

&gt; Now aparently in the gas station shops they sell '76' balls, to put on
&gt; the end of your radio antenna.

got one on my antenna.  the '76' stations give them away 
occasionally.  also, kids collect them.  try to get ones from 
different stations.  maybe it's like 'Pogs and Slammers' or 
something.  anyway, they grab up most of them.

the problem is they don't sell them.  they give them away.  if they 
sold them, i could buy a bunch for you.  since they give them away, 
us polite Minnesota people feel guilty when we take more than one.

i *could* distract the clerk and dump the whole box into my pocket 
but i'm not good at larceny.  Minnesota Nice has its own 
form of revenge for that sort of thing.  while the authorities would 
not likely be called, there is a good chance i would get &quot;tarred and 
balled&quot; with a boiling mixture of  maple syrup and blaze orange '76' balls.

aw, what the heck.  how many you want?  :)
