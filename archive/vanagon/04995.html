&gt;Which Trailhandlers did you get? There are several different models
&gt;available. I bought the Trailhandler APTs for my 87 Syncro and am quite
&gt;pleased with them. They are a load range C tire and for me there was a
&gt;dramatic decrease in the type of behavior you are describing when I
&gt;installed them in place of the non-reinforced Tirestone all-season radials
&gt;that were mounted when I purchased it.
&gt;One thing to check. The Sears guys inflated my tires to 30 PSI all around,
&gt;rather than to the manual's specifications.

additional info: i just went out and looked at my Michelin XZX 'reinforced'
tires. on the sidewall is written:

tread    2 rayon plies
       + 2 steel plies
sidewall 2 rayon plies

so i guess the '6-ply' IS the total of all the tread and sidewall. hmmmm.
i sure thought the sidewall was stronger than just 2 plies. but that would
why it was so much 'easier' for sharp objects to penetrate the sidewalls
than the tread.
