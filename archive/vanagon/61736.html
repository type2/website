Subject: Mechanical lessons?

Howdy,

I admit it.  I'm a total illiterate when it comes to engines.  But I have a
LONG trip coming up... about 6 months in my van.  I need to learn.

I'm thinking of organizing a set of weekly 'Wasserboxer mechanics' courses
somewhere in the Bay Area, and I'm wondering if there is any interest from
anyone else in the bay area?  If you are interested, what would you think
was a reasonable per-person weekly fee?  And lastly, are weekend or weekday
nights better for you?

Ron
