&gt; Hi all:

&gt; Can anyone tell me how old a vehicle in California has to be in order to
&gt; be exempt from auto emission testing.  I've been told &quot;20 years old&quot; and
&gt; I've also been told &quot;1966 and newer&quot; are tested.  Does anybody know for
&gt; sure?  Has this changed recently?

As it stands today, 1966 and newer is correct.  Quentin Kopp has 
introduced legislation to have the exemption date &quot;rolling.&quot;
