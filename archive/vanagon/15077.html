Subject: video update!

This thing is potentially turning into a mess!  I've gone thru 
everything everyone has sent me, and tried to take into consideration
how strong your feelings were.  Not everyone can make every time, but I
suggest the follow.  This supercedes my previous posts on the matter:

The show goes until 3 on Sunday.  How about if we all meet at 3:15
right after the show, for video showings in Jon Peter's van (I'll
bring my 9&quot; color DC tv, and my 8mm camcorder, with about one 
hour's worth of play time on the batteries at this point.  After
viewing the video, we can all have potluck supper.  Please sign up!
Below is a list of people planning to attend, and what they have
signed up so far to bring.  Below that, you'll find Jon Peters
directions and some info on the show.  See you there at 3:15
on Sunday!  Of course, many of you will want to come earlier 
and take in the show.....

The Golden Gate Chapter of the Vintage VW Club of America will be holding
their Spring Meet on Sunday, April 9 in San Jose at Kelley Park from 10am to 
3pm.  The show will include a car show, swap meet, toy show, dealer displays, 
etc.  The meet is at the San Jose Historical Museum, on the corner of Phelan 
and Senter Roads.  From 101 (Southbound) take Story Road Offramp West (South), 
go for about 1.5 to 2 miles and just before the first set of RR tracks you 
cross is Senter Road.  Turn left on Senter and about a 1/4 mile up you should 
see the Phelan Road entrance.  For more info, call Rick Spohn at 408-683-0154 
or SPOHN_at_STLVM6.VNET.IBM.COM or Jon Peters, Jon_Peters_at_UB_dot_com.

Since Jon Peters of our vanagon list founded this show and handed it off to 
the current GGC Prez, he is going to make an attempt to get him to allow Jon to 
park his SynkroWestie inside the show area and have the awning open so's we can 
watch videos from under the awning...  Keep an eye out for a White Synkro 
Westie with Hannover # plates on it and a black trailer hitched up to it.  Jon 
- please update us if this plan will not work.
