Subject: Piston slap

Earlier this week I read something about piston slap being a problem with
some 93 Eurovans. Based on the description of piston slap symptoms, I think
my van has this condition.

My question is, what does this mean? Is this a really, really bad thing,
second only to the heartbreak of psoriasis, or is it a lesser evil like
having dingleberries? Does piston slap, left untreated, develop into piston
poke or piston punch?

(Okay, I'm getting a bit carried away here.)

Should I be concerned about piston slap? What actions do you recommend I take?

Thanks,

Jeff
