Subject: Re: Planning for trip..July 16-23 Can you help?

&gt; any VW events going on around this time? anyone heading north and want to
&gt; caravan? We are going to the Grassroots Festival...a 4 day music festival
&gt; that is spectacular. if anyone is interested, i'll sent details. lots of
&gt; bands, hippies, kind folks, busses, food, drink, et al.

Sounds like you'll just miss the Bug Out in Waynesboro Virginia.  Its 
7-21 - which sounds like the middle of you trip when you'll be way north.

&gt; also, in my many travels to ithaca, i've always sped up there in going way
&gt; above the speed limits...in a car. now that Rumba will be in the best shape
&gt; ever, i'd like to do some camping, see the sites, etc. anyone got some
&gt; suggestions about good areas to camp?

If you have any spare time while passing over the Blue Ridge - again 
Waynesboro - check out the Blue Ridge Parkway or Skyline Drive.  I know 
I-81 from Stauton to Front Royal rather well.  If you really have time 
take the Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park from I-64 to I-66 
then go west to I-81.
