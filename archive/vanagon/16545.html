Subject: Re: westie rear seat transplant?

&gt;Anybody have any experience transplanting the westie rear seat/bed assembly
&gt;from a type II to a vanagon?

 Dunnit under desperation. The vanagon deck is 4&quot; lower than breadloafs, so 
the neat hinge mechanism won't work. You must either build up the engine 
deck, ie. plywood and a couple of 2&quot; x 4&quot;s, or remove the side mounts and 
just keep the main hinges. I chose the latter, but DON'T reccommend it. -&gt;&gt; 
The seat then needs to be anchored to the frame in the upright position 
somehow, I'm using Westy threaded knobs and some angle iron. The seat/bed 
lays flat on the wood seat frame at the right height for the vanagon deck 
then, but needs a front support which is a pain. We rest it on a side jump 
seat. The seat and wardrobe are about 5&quot; narrower than the vanagon, and you 
need to recut the wardrobe edge to match the vanagon wall contour. I have a 
plywood subfloor which the seat base is bolted through, also a pain. Look 
for a Vanagon Weekender or real Westy. I am!
