Subject: Joel Walker, how 'bout your E-mail address?

Joel:

Thanks so much for your invaluable help...  If you ever need some help 
with a project that involves Graphic Design, let me know.  I intend on 
owing you big time 'till I can get my bearings with this thing.  I 
haven't even found the battery yet--wait don't tell me.  I could use the 
surprise.

Please send me your E-mail address!

The thwarted idle adjustment makes sense to me.  The CO sensor probably 
has NEVER been changed on this thing (it wouldn't surprise me anyway).  
As soon as I figure out where I'm buying the Bentley manual I'll be 
changing that out. As well as the temperature sensor.  Again, my 
understanding was that the idle was not adjustable, the throttle screw 
does not look like it has been tampered with (wax is still intact) the CO 
adjustment screw cover is missing--how might the idle has been adjusted?

To: Jerry Huff who recommended Performance Specialties as a source for 
the $55 Vanagon Bentley manual.  I appreciate the tip but be advised that 
their mail order department is closed until Jan 1996--apparently they are 
rebuilding, remodeling and to my amazement, they have shut mail order 
down for the process (earthquake damage???? maybe).

Joe Baysle did offer me a 20% discount at Jim Ellis, though--I guess I'll 
get it there.  Thanks again, Joel.  Don't think I should wait till the 
end of the year.  I hope it's more informative than the one for my '92 
Passat Variant.

Getting the upholstery cleaner after it tomorrow!  It's pretty grungy 
inside (is this what weekends are for?).

BTW, on telling a friend about this acquisition he remarked:  &quot;Donald, 
most people hit 36 and have the early mid-life crisis and they buy red 
Mazda Miata convertibles--you buy a big grey bus?&quot;--

Do we drive Volkswagens in spite of VWOA?
