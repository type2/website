Subject: Re: MPH and MPG


We drove to Anchorage last year to buy a canoe, and treated the Vanagon 
to a tank of 94 octane Exxon gas (premium in Fairbanks is 90 or 91).  On the 
way home we got 24 mpg, the best ever, even with the boat on the roof at 
60-65 mph.  That flies in the face of the octane vs. mpg thread from a 
while back (no relationship), unless the canoe actually lessened 
aerodynamic drag...

&gt; I have always gotten 18-20 mpg.  Speed and/or use of A/C has never made
&gt; much difference.  Here, being North of Philadelphia, the oxygenated gas in
&gt; use during winter will drop mileage by 2 mpg.  I always figured the main
&gt; influence on MPG for the vanagon, is strictly the resistance of moving that
&gt; box through air!
