Greetings,

Trying to get rid of two things:

FREE; 4tuned duel muffler. Great condition. New coat of paint, never used.

$5.00; Brand new in box VDO Dip stick sender (works with VDO guage)

I'm in San Francisco.

Also, I'm looking for a vacuum advance distrubutor that will work with my
1600 Dual Port.
