On the way home from surfing, after dropping my friend off, I was
hearing a noise frm the front end that sounded like a litter of puppies that
yearned to breath free.

After a nap, I pulled the front drums off.  Well, it seems that when the
front brakes were dragging, they heated the drum, etc up enuf to melt 
most of the grease.  In turn wearing the bearings considerably, and the
seal for the right side is tweaked beyond belief.  

So, I re-packed the bearing, sanded down the shoes and drums with #40 sandpaper,
and put it all back together.

It looks like I should prolly get new wheel bearings in the not too-too
distant future, and front shoes would also be a good idea.  Oh, and the
seal, too.

But, since I sanded the shoes and drum down, the brakes are a LOT better -
I can actually lock them up now!

I think the trip (250 miles +/-) was a bit much for what little grease remained
on the bearings.  If I'd a let it go much longer, I'm sure one would have
broken or siezed - Yikes!  Anyone ever had this happen?
