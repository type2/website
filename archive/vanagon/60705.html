&gt;Someone recently wrote in about their new clutch shuddering occasionally

My last vehicle, an '87 Acura, shuddered occasionally when starting in
first gear.  It had a bullet proof drive train that never caused me any
repairs in the 10 years and 200,000 kms I owned and drove it.  My '91 Westy
does the same (shudders 5-10% of the time when starting from a stop in 1st
gear).  I just figured it was nothing to worry about.  Am I living in
ignorant bliss?
