&gt; as a list member, rather than get into an accident trying to figure
&gt; out where this one member may have decided to put his sticker.  Top
&gt; middle of the font window maybe?  Dunno - suggestions welcome -

I'll assume that Arkansawers don't have to follow the rules since meeting 
other list members on accident is about as likely as a good surf day.

Otherwise, I'll have to get out the slide rule and figure our where top 
middle/whatever is. ;) Joe
