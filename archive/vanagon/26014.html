Subject: NEATO applications


Several people requested NEATO applications from me a few weeks back 
and I just wanted to check and make sure that everyone who wanted 
one got theirs.

If you haven't recieved yours yet, I may have lost your address.  I 
think even those of you overseas should have yours by now.

In any case if you wanted one and didn't get one, I didn't mean to 
leave you out.

I can be reached at deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu.

Dave
