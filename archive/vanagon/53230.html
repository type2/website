 Hi EV Scouts:

I visited the VW dealer today for routine maintenance and spoke to the
service manager. He has just received repair manuals for the '97 EV and
he thinks this is a clear sign that they will be imported soon, probably
in the spring. HOWEVER....he did some digging and discovered that in the
States only the automatic transmission will be available on them. It's
in Canada, where the '97's will have a 5-cyliner turbo diesel option, that
a manual transmission will be sold.

That's the way it is....Tuesday, December 17.
