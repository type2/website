I had to replace one tire which was cut on road debris.  Mine came with 
imported Goodyear tires and I have been extremely pleased with them 
(except for the sidewall being cut on the pieces of another car from an 
accident I came up on)


and how will they do an MV table for a dual siding door bus?  I don't 
need that second door as much as I need that table.

&gt; They will come w/dual airbags and feature a second sliding door on the driver's
&gt; rear. Later in the year they will also introduce a 6-cylinder engine for the
&gt; EV. THey sell a diesel in Canada but not apparently in the US.

&gt; All for now,
