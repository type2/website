&gt;Found the code on the bottom of the left side of the trans, thanks Joel!  Now
&gt;the question is, do I have the right trans?  The code on this is CK118 3645.
&gt; Haynes says that this CK on a '72 should be CA.  It has CA for up to '73, CN
&gt;after '73, CM with 1800cc engines , CP with 2000cc engines, and CC for
&gt;limited slip, but no CK.
&gt;What years is this trans?  Inquiring mids want to know!

as best i can figure from this stuff, transmission codes for 68-79 buses are:
CA - CN  up to vin 215-2300-000   (manual transmission)
CP - CX  from  vin 216-0000-001   (manual transmission)

now, you have a 1972. so that fits (CK is between CA and CN).
but the other books don't get very specific. :(
one book says that, by engine size, it was this way:
1600cc AD or AS engines = CE,CU transmissions
1700cc CA or CE engines = CE,CU transmissions
1800cc AP engine        = CM transmission
2000cc CJ engine        = CP transmission

but nothing that i have says anything about what the code letters mean.
it could simply be the manufacturer (if someone else assembled the trans)
or perhaps just a way of designating which year it was made/assembled.
it might also possibly be an imported bus with some sort of special
transmission (like those mountain-climbing gears). notice any really really
low-and-slow 1st and 2nd gear?? :)

sorry i can't help more.
