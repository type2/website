&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Time, space, and money have all come together to bring
&gt;&gt;a couple of cars out of hiding and up for sale.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1962 crew cab flared fenders and a missing rocker under the
&gt;&gt;cargo door.  The nose is perfect, very minimal rust, decent gates
&gt;&gt;and is generally a complete bus minus an engine  $2600
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1963 15 window walk thru with an average amount of rust and a substantial
&gt;&gt;dent in the front clip that could be repaired. No seats but it does
&gt;&gt;run and drive sort of. $1950
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1961 crew cab with all kinds of cool rust in the frame and cargo
&gt;&gt;area. I suppose it has gates but I doubt it has ever run in the entire
&gt;&gt;time it has been in the U.S. This bus is probably about $1800 but
&gt;&gt;who cares anyway?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1960 standard  This bus is a real piece of work with a patched
&gt;&gt;hole in the roof and no motor.  It's rolling in at $750
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1985 vanagon 150k a/c, p/s, 4 speed and 3 seats.  All together a
&gt;&gt;good running van $3200
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  1957 rag top bug body in very good condition $700
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I can be reached at 916 631 3650 after 6 pm PST
&gt;&gt;   Ask for Todd or Dean or you can e-mail
