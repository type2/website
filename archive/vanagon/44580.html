I'm running a web page, Demented Dworkin's Bus Bits Reminder, with the
purpose of making it easier for list members to figure out who has
what parts, so that those that need the parts can get in touch with
them.  It's at http://www.village_dot_org/vw/parts/Welcome.html.

If you want to place an ad, send me mail (dworkin_at_village_dot_org).
