Christa and I are going to try to make a custom-fit tent fly for the 
pop-top.  It can rain a lot on the B.C. We(s)t Coast, so this will be a 
valuable addition to our camper--providing it works, of course.

The fly will attach to points on the camper itself, so we won't need to 
drive any stakes or tie down to anything around us.  We'll report the 
outcome of this exercise to the list when we get it done.  It'll probably 
take a couple of months of refinement before we get happy with it.

Anybody else already done this, or something similar?
