&gt; My OTHER vehicle is an '86 Toyota Camry.  231,000 miles, uses nary a 
&gt; drop of oil (I hate to admit this but I don't even check it between 
&gt; changes-- it just never goes down!) and engine never been in need of 
&gt; any repair aside to routine timing belts etc.  Here's (IMHO) the key: 
&gt;  2500mi oil changes and *long* daily trips of about 100-250 miles (I 
&gt; drove alot for my job).
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of Toyota, why can they make such a dang good car.  Before 
&gt; you guys flame me to death, please understand I have my true 
&gt; allegiance to the quirky stuff, stuff with character.  I'ved owned 
&gt; (and loved) Fiat 850 &amp; 124 Spyders, Volvo 1800s, Nortons, Bultacos, 
&gt; Hodakas, and my share of VWs.  But gosh darnit all, it sure is nice to get in, turn 
&gt; the key and go.  Maybe I'm getting old.  Someone help me.
&gt; 

I agree whole heartedly on the Toyota issue. We have had an 81 Tercel and
a 77 Corolla liftback both with 150,000 miles on them. Unfortunately while the
engines may have been great  the bodies could not withstand the winter
ravages and road salt of Ontario....DC
