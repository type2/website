Subject: Re: Monza (sp?) muffler


&gt;sandblast all it off and go back with this &quot;hot paint&quot; which has to dry and 
&gt;then be cured for 1 hour at 650 deg F.  Anyone know how hot the extractor 
&gt;will get?  I don't think that I can get 650 deg in my kitchen.  I would hate 
&gt;to think of the smell :-(.  Any ideas?   

Get it coated with a ceramic material at a place like Jet-Hot coatings.  It
is rather expensive, but you will end up with a muffler that will not rust,
and very resistant to heat (to 2000 F.).  It will make your muffler the
last one you'd buy for a long time.
