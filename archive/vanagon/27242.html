After folding the hoops on the single cab in a parking garage that claimed
to have adequate clearence I think I will pass on the parking dungeon for
Westy. I can deal with a little heat and hammer for the single but prefer to
pass on replacing the fiberglass top. At the start of my present job, the
building management initially gave me greif about allocating an outdoor spot
for me. It seemed that they changed their minds when I asked them to put
into writing their willingness to replace the top if the parking garage
muffed it up. Of course I would prefer to keep it out of the weather. I
can't understand why the architect would design such of a low clearence. Not
everyone drives a Q45.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Aww, don't give up yet, Rusty!  Don't believe the parking garage wimps 
&gt;&gt; &gt;until you try it out. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Your forward speed is also a factor to consider.  For instance, at six
&gt;&gt; hundred miles an hour a Volkswagen bus will fit through an opening only 26
&gt;&gt; inches high.  Mebbe 25.  Something like that.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm.... Another reason for doing a Porsche 6 conversion?
