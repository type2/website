Subject: Parting out  10/78 2.0L auto. Bus

       hey all,
   The county told me i have to get rid of one of my parts buses (soon) so i
thought i'd let y'all know.  it's  a 79 2.0 automatic.  The body is pretty
much trash but if you think you may want something speak up.  and do it
soon.  make me a reasonable offer and we'll talk.  i'm a little slow
replying to mail but this time i have to hurry so don't dawdle.  reply to
djones_at_sam.i3_dot_net.
