Subject: Re: rear engine hatch screws &amp; perfect brakes

          i just replaced every door on my '66 kombi (except the
          engine hatch) and had to beat myself to death and then spend
          a few bucks to get the hinge screws out.  One is broken and
          will remain so.  I'm tired of &amp;^_at_*&amp;% with it!  I received 3
          separate posts from people on this list who went thru the
          same ordeal.
          Spray all screwws with liquid wrench, etc and let them sit
          for a while.
          Use the correct phillips bit (or you'll do much damage) and
          a long breaker bar.  If you're lucky some will break loose.
          For the stubborn ones, spray again and try impact tool.
          After hitting hands several times and always questioning if
          you've got the impact turned the right way, find a friend
          with a compressor and impact gun.
          For me, all but 4 came off.  I took it to two old german VW
          mechanics (one worked in Hitler's Berlin, the other at
          Wolfsburg) and let them take care of the remaining 4,
          telling them I didn't want to know how they got them off,
          just do it!  I trust them 100% but knew it might not be
          pretty.
          I've been told that replacement screws with allen head
          instead of phillips were available but haven't found them
          yet.  Anyone know about these?  We have zero
          hardware/fastener stores in Gainesville except the chain
          stores and I suspect most of you have already found out how
          good their stuff is (sarcasm applied liberally).
          I do everything possible to avoid the extractor method
          because if they're rusted in there this good, it's likely
          youll end up with a broken extractor to worry about also.
          The seal rails blocking a straight entry to the screws is
          the biggest problem!  I was hesitant to bend them for proper
          angle but I noticed the front doors have a half circle
          cutaway at these critical points.
          Sorry for the length of this post.  Oh yeah, my bus has
          great brakes (after replacing all the lines) but dead motor.
