Subject: Germans Invited To Join

For your's all information, I send the following snail mail today to the guy
who publishes the German language magazine devoted to Volkswagen vans
(specially early model vans, but what the heck.) 

Let's hope they don't start all sending e-mail onto the list in German!

	Brandholzweg 1

Can you put the following two advertisements in the next few issues of Bulli
Kartel?

&quot;I am seeking to correspond with someone in Europe who speaks english who can
share 
technical knowledge about the Volkswagen Syncro (4x4) Transporter/Caravelle
(1986-
1991), especially off-road preparation and use (e.g. 16&quot; version). Derek
