Subject: MOFOCO report

Hi All,

I ordered some parts from MOFOCO for a bug engine I am working on and they
sent me mainly junk.  Here are the problems:

The wrist pin bushings on the &quot;rebuilt&quot; connecting rods were over sized and
out-of-round.

The reground camshaft had worn out bearing surfaces.

The &quot;Good Used&quot; crank timing gear had smashed teeth.

Out ouf the eight valve adjustment screws they sent, seven were the 9mm
type IV style.

The new oil cooler was the wrong one.

The &quot;brand new heads&quot; were assembled with used intake valves and used valve
springs.

All of the parts are dirty--the crank was slightly magnetic and had lots of
shot stuck to it--not healthy for a new engine

On a positive side, aside from the shot, the reground crankshaft is quite
good.  All of the machined surfaces are right on the button and runout is
virtually nil.

I've sent all but the heads back and given them the opertunity to make
good.  I'll report the results.

-Tom
