Subject: RE: FOLLOWUP: Squeaky/Creaky Vanagon Suspension



Take the Vanagon to your trusted mechanic for this job. Its a bear of a
home job, apart from ripping into the front end, you really do nead a
press to push out the old bushing (after grinding off the spot welds) and
to drift it back in (then weld). The bushing is the cheapest part. You do
need to align afterwards.

Why not just replace the _one_ thats sqeeking. I know that the theory goes
that if one bushing is toast then the others are soon to be the same, but...

Greasing/oiling/silonizing just masks the symptoms, the bushing needs
replacing.

Whew, I didn't mean to rant so much.
