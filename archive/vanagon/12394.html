Subject: Re: '56 kombi brake problem


&gt;        I noticed what I _thought_ could be the problem - the MC pushrod
&gt;was almost all the way out, ie preloaded.  St. Muir could only tell me
&gt;what to do if the brakes needed to be tightened, not loosened, so I
&gt;loosened it up to where I though the preload was right, and put it back 
&gt;together. Bled the brakes.  Now I have almost no brakes!
&gt;
&gt;        I now know that I hafta screw it back in, but I'm wondering exactly
&gt;how far.  Until I get the right pedal feel and the brake light still works?

That's what I would do, by trial and error :-( until I got it right.  But
if I knew what the VW specification for how far out (or in) the pushrod
should be screwed around with, I would start there, and proceed with the
trial and error.

How about setting it to a point halfway between where you have it now, and
where it was?  Or - considering that you had slightly dragging brakes
originally, and no brakes now, how about a setting very close to the
original one, say, 3/4 of the way back to the original setting?

I wish I could be helping you mess around with it, but my two cents worth
is all I can offer, hope the feedback helps.

Wolf
