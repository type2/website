Subject: Overseas Vans In Cyberspace

OK, here are some more VW Vans in Cyberspace from Europe. Let's hope that
the conversations in these posts are a little more weighty than some guy
wanting to borrow a VW van to move furniture.=20

Luckly, the first one is in english, and will probably amuse our list
members from the UK/British Isles.

The others are in German so it beats me as to what they are saying.=20
