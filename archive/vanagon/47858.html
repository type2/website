Subject: Question on CV joints


This is a bizarre one!
Upon pulling my CV joints to remove my tranny for a rebuild :-(  90 weight 
oil came pouring out of the inner joint on both sides.  I know that all of 
the joints should have grease in them.   The only way oil could have gotten 
into them is if it leaked down the spline of the tranny shaft into the 
bearing, or if someone filled them with 90 weight a long time ago???

Has anyone EVER SEEN this?  How can I prevent this from happening if it 
truly is a leak?

Peter
