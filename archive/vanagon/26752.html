Subject: Maintenance Intervals

One of the surprises when I bought my 86 GL new almost a decade ago was the
lack of a specified service interval for several items.  I have noticed
discussion on this lst recently about the lack of a replacement interval for
coolant.  There seems to be consensus to do it (but less on what to do it
with).  Incidentally I decided to replace mine every three years, and use
the VW stuff, and have had only a few tiny leaks.  

But what about other items??  VW ( and Bentley) say the hypoid gear oil
doesn't need to be replaced. Good idea?? [I still have the now 9 year old
original.]   VW doesn't mention the fuel filter, but I have changed mine
about every 50,000 miles.  I also replaced spark plug wires, cap and rotor
at 80,000 (even though all tested OK on my ohm meter) and performance seemed
to improve; and shortened the 30,000 mile replacement interval on plugs and
air filters.  And I have replaced drive belts every three years---one broke
once on a trip and tore up the plastic flange connecting a waterline to the
block which almost ruined a vacation and created a lifelong paranoia.  

Has anyone seen modifications from VW on any of these since the original
intervals were set years ago??  Or developed their own sense of reasonable
preventative maintenance??
