&gt; 1) In tight turns such as parking, reversing out of driveways, U-turns

&gt;  there is great resistance to motion. It feels as if the brakes  are
binding,
&gt;  but they aren't. Give it gas and it moves right around, but let off the
gas
&gt;  and it rapidly decellerates.

Hmmmmm?  It depends.  The natural action of the Syncro's viscous coupling
would be to lock-up and send some power to the front in this situation,
causing &quot;some&quot; of the &quot;binding&quot; you describe.  My van exhibits this behavior,
but it sounds like yours exhibits it to a greater extent.  Hard to tell
without driving them back to back.  I suspect that it might be just a matter
of perception of how much &quot;binding&quot; is taking place.  On the other hand, if
you have a LOT of binding, perhaps your VC is kaput an locked-up all the
time?

Good luck,
