A while back some one in my family garbage picked some interesting 
hardbound books for me.  Automotive Quarterly I think.  one of these 
books features a late '60's? bus that was steam powered that 
had a radiator lookin thing on the front.  i forget how many were 
made but it was a very low production conversion.  What cought 
my eye was the fact that it was advertized as being Totally pollutant 
free and used R- 11 refrigerant insted of water.  hmmmmmm
