Subject: WTB - Interior Parts

Does anyone in Minnesota know where I might
find interior parts for my 87 Syncro ?  Here's what
I'm looking for;

    Rear seat that converts to bed w/ cushions
    Rear cabinet
    Side table
    Rear facing seats

Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Kevin
