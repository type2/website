Subject: I've fallen and I can't fix my bus (was: gas mileage)


Well, whaddaya know. In response to my post about my overheating bus
putting out occasional bursts of white smoke, several people (Thanks,
DSchwarze, Joel, and Cheeses) have mentioned experiences similar to
this, evidently caused by a leaking power-brake master cylinder letting
fluid into the vacuum line!

I had suggested that simply as a wild guess, believing it was a huge
stretch. But maybe not...

For my first trick, I'll disconnect and cap the vacuum line at the
manifold. Don't try this at home, kids-- the brakes will be stiff
as all get-out without power, and only a fat guy like me can muster
the weight on the pedal to get them to work.

But if this suddenly makes the engine run cool &amp; strong (as opposed
to its present hot-and-strong method), I'll die a happy man. A M/C
rebuild will then be in order.

If the engine isn't too far gone already, that is-- it's been running
hot for a long time.

Thanks again for the help, guys--- you're the greatest.

 -Steve Maher
