Subject: Re: 911-Drivetrain in 66 Micro??

     &gt;I was thinking about putting a Porsche-6 and maybe trans in my Micro. 
     &gt;I know that it can be done in a vanagon, but I'm not sure if it would 
     &gt;work in my bus.  Any information or advice would be greatly 
     &gt;appreciated!
     
     There are several options available to you here.
     
     If you put a relatively low power engine (150bhp) you can get away 
     with a rebuilt and modified (strengthened) trans. Check out some of 
     the ads in VWtrends for drag trans. This option has some drawbacks in 
     that you would firstly have to fit a straightaxle kit to get rid of 
     the r/boxes (you could keep them but it would be crazy). 
     
     Fortunately the Porsche engine bolts straight onto a bus trans so 
     that's cool, unfortunately the flywheel on a Porsche engine has no 
     starter teeth on it! the teeth are on the clutch. Solution is to get a 
     Type IV flywheel and have the 5 bolt holes bored into the centre boss 
     using the porsche flywheel as a jig. Then you can mount the VW 
     flywheel on the Porsche motor. It is advisable to then go for a late 
     bus (aircooled) 2.0 litre trans with the high ratios. This trans can 
     suposidely take 300bhp  without modification and no drag starts, 
     please ;)
     
     To fit the 2.0 litre IRS trans you have to do an IRS conversion on the 
     drive shafts etc. There are two ways to do this. One is to fit a Bus 
     Boys IRS conversion kit. The other is to cut the torsion tube from a 
     '72-79 bus, cut out your torsion tube and weld in the late bus one. 
     This gives you a complete -&gt;'79 rear trans.  You will have to then 
     make a support to hold the pulley end of the Porsche motor and hang 
     this support of the end of the chassis rails.
     
     easy, ;)
