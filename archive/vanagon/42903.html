To All:

The typical VW engine fire results not from a lack of clamps but from:

   A - Abrasion of the fuel pipe where it passes through the forward breast
tin, and

   B - Failure of the pressed-in brass pipe in either the carb or the fuel
pump.


A clamp provides no benefit when fitted to a hose hardened by age.  The
externally reinforced hose used by Volkswagen works perfectly well, as
history has shown, so long as it is in good condition.  The major problem
here is owners who fail to replace the hoses when they harden.

Internally reinforced hose should always be secured with clamps.

My first 'sermons' were posted in response to the fire hazard in older
Volkswagens.  In those articles I explain how to prevent the fuel pipe from
being worn through by fabricating a simple bulkhead fitting, and how to
re-install the brass tube in the carb or fuel pump, which always warns of
impending failure by leaking, often for months before it finally lets go.

The saddest part of fuel-related fires in air-cooled Volkswagens is that they
are preventable.
