Subject: Re: win prizes! name that noise!

&gt;hello everyone, here's my problem of this week (81 adventurewagen):
&gt;
&gt;a chirping noise, only when engine has warmed (after driving a few
&gt;minutes).  the noise is most apparent at lower rpms in 1st and 2nd, but i
&gt;can sometimes hear it in 3rd and at higher rpms in 1st and 2nd. i have not
&gt;heard it in 4th.  the noise is not apparent when the van is not in gear, i.e.,
&gt;revving in neutral does not produce it.  occasionally the noise will be
&gt;present for a split second when the engine first starts.  after i have been
&gt;cruising on the highway for awhile, the noise disappears (won't occur at
&gt;lower gears/rpms), and sometimes reappears (at lower gears/rpms). 
&gt;fwiw, a compression test 6,000 miles ago revealed 110-125 psi on all
&gt;four cylinders.  also, i have been using a lighter weight oil (10w-30)
&gt;cause that's what was in it when i got it and i'm just using what was left
&gt;of a case :-0.  (next oil change gets 20w-50).
&gt;
&gt;i originally thought it was an exhaust leak, but that doesn't explain the
&gt;intermittent nature, unless i'm missing something.  
&gt;
&gt;i was planning on finally taking my summer vacation next week, and
&gt;would like to figure this out/take care of it if i need to before then.  any
&gt;suggestions on what to check out would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;TIA, matthew
&gt;

I'm just jumping in on this one, so excuse me if it's already been dismissed
as a possibility.  Big guess here, but when I think chirping I think of
rubber vibrating--maybe a belt or a broken motor/transmission mount
vibrating?  What is the frequency of the chirping?
