Subject: Re: Anyone Heard From Richard Palmer?


&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; hey, richard's been on the road for a week now...anyone heard from him
&gt; or seen him? i guess he left buses on the blueridge for points west..
&gt; howabout a trip report?
&gt;

Don't know if I'll run into him on the road or not, but Richard and I
traded e-mail regarding our summer road adventures and we should be
traveling to some of the same spots along the way. I'll be leaving
Jacksonville, Florida this Monday (June 10th). My first stop will be
Athens, Georgia....then off to Atlanta, Asheville NC area (possibly to
Charlotte and Raleigh for a couple of FURTHUR festival shows), then out to
the Ozarks. After that, to Indiana (Deer Creek)...then down to Birmingham,
then Memphis (HORDE). Hopefully, from there...back to Jax, Fl. If I run
into Richard on the road, I'll call hubby back at home and have him post a
note here for everyone. I'll be traveling in Bertha (the Wonderbus - a 78
Westy camper). If you should pass us on the road (FL license: GR8TFUL),
honk if anything falls off! :):):)
