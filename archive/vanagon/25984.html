&gt; 
&gt;      So my questions: There is no obvious damage.  We are talking some
&gt;      semi-serious moisture here, a tablespoon full or so, appearing as
&gt;      condensation covering a good bit of the lens. Turning on the headlight
&gt;      does not evaporate it at all. Is it possible for moisture to enter at
&gt;      the bulb-reflector joint? Should I try sealing the bulb with a thin
&gt;      layer of silicon - sounds dubious to me. Or send my wife out
&gt;      to the pick-it yourself junkyards, again...?

Tom,

What a crock, they failed you over water in the headlight lense?, I drove 
the '86 I had around for years with moisture in there, of course FL 
dosen't have inspections anymore.  

BTW I've seen many vanagons with this.  

I do know how much they cost though, due to a minor front end altercation.
About three years ago one lense cost about $120 OUCH.  I would dry it out 
and try in vain to seal it and keep it dry till you get through inspection.

Good Luck,
