Subject: re: Cruise control for '80-82 Vanagon


&gt;Boy do I know the feeling! I put a unit in made by ARA. It uses an
&gt;electronic actuator (does not rely on a vacuum). It's worked great for the
&gt;last 6 years.

Steve, any idea if that unit is still made? Or, do you know where that
company is located, and maybe their address or phone number?

I'd LOVE to get one of those.
