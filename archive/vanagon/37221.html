Subject: '83 Clutch Adjustment




Help!!  Just replaced clutch in '83 wasserboxer.  Had to resurface the 
flywheel.  Now, it appears that the clutch needs adjustment.  The only
adjustable part that is in the whole system seems to be the Master 
Cylinder push rod.  It seems to be in an almost inaccessable location.
Anyone else had this problem?  Have any solutions?

Thanks much,

Jim Arnott
