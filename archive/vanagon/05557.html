Subject: Window Tinting 'Falia's

Since the Magic Bus won't fit in the garage (and I'm unable
to install a roll-up door due to slope of the driveway) I'm
thinking about tinting my 'falia's windows.
Has any 'falia owner out there had this done?  I'm wondering
how the window behind the closet was done.  Did the closet
have to be removed?  As I've mentioned in the past, the panel
paper is bubbling and the curtains are fading.

-Scott.
