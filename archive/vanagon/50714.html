i'm fading away... but then some of you have noticed that for a while now.

the RED poptop on my TITAN RED '87 is fading.  while not technically a
gel-coat, it is chalking and losing its luster and wet look just like a gel
coat does.  i believe it is a paint applied over a fiberglass base but
someone can correct me.  anyway, i wanted to restore some of the shinyness
to it and the usual assortment of waxes and rubbing compounds did nothing
remarkable.  so much for advertising.

what i DID find was a product called &quot;Instant Glass Cote&quot; made by
Starbright.  it is an acrylic-urethane clearcoat that easily applies with a
brush and is supposed to last a year or two.  i put it on last night in
several thin coats with drying time between applications.  i have to say
that the initial results are impressive.  the faded red paint has darkened
to near its original color and it has a hard, wet-gloss finish.  i don't
know how well it will stand up but the test commences.  and for now, i took
5 years off the look of the top.  mebbe it'll work on receding hair lines,
too...
