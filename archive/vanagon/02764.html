&gt; Holy Cow, Steve!  Vanagons must be WAY bigger inside than Transporters!  With
&gt; that list of stuff you bring camping there'd be no room for any people, much
&gt; less surfboards, in my `74 7-passenger bus!

I had a '74 camper and had that much stuff plus.  My wife always insists on 
bringing 4 pillows (4 Fuc---g Pillows!).  I'm able to get the aforemention
stuff in and still have room.  How many people you hauling anyway?  It's
just me and my wife usually.

&gt; OK, so here's my list of camping stuff and considerations... bear in mind that
&gt; I don't have kids and only camp with, at most, one other person.

Guess that answered my question. ;)

&gt;  I carry a
&gt; mini-Weber charcoal grill but Steve's talk about a gas grill has got me
&gt; thinking... not only is charcoal slower but you have to pack briquettes and
&gt; deal with the mess...  Hmm....  You may have scored another convert Steve!

Like I said, it only takes one side-by-side comparison and it's all over.

&gt; On longer trips with questionable water supply I carry a 5-gallon jug
&gt; with spigot for water.  It rides next to the back hatch.  Dishes are
&gt; done in the largest cook pot that's dirty.

The Rubbermaid (Rubbermade...Hmmm sounds kinky no matter how you spell it ;) )
tubs I use stack real well in each other so they don't take too much space and
the last one on top holds stuff in it too.

&gt; Cooling gear: One (1) mid-sized cooler.  I'd like to have more cooling, but
&gt; it's just a lowly Transporter (no icebox) and I like to be able to bungee my
&gt; cooler to the back seat so it doesn't wander around.  If I have two people
&gt; I'll often use a bigger cooler though.

This really depends on the length of the trip and how well planned your meals
are.  I suppose some people can dehydrate alot of food and not need much cooling
space at all.

&gt; Sleeping arrangements:  This is pretty vehicle-specific if you're going to

I prefer blankets too, but I gotta be ready for the cold just in case.

&gt; Lighting: One (1) flashlight for nighttime emergency auto repair and
&gt; bush excursions.  In the above-mentioned cardboard box there's also a
&gt; candle to provide mood lighting. ;)  If I'm going to be camping in a
&gt; campground I'd like to bring a pump-up pellet rifle for shooting out the
&gt; neighbors damn star-eclipsing blinding damn Coleman lantern but I'm a
&gt; little too well socially adjusted for that... barely.  Fortunately I
&gt; don't use campgrounds that much... Sorry Steve, I just had to express an
&gt; alternate point of view!  :) :)
&gt; 
&gt; Standard equipment that always stays in Bobo:  the above-mentioned flashlight,
&gt; a tube of sunblock, tide tables and a Swiss Army knife with corkscrew and can
&gt; opener.  Oh yeah, I should mention that the middle seat is almost never in the
&gt; bus either, in case anybody had any doubts!  :)
&gt; 

That still sounds like a shit-load to me to.  So why do ya think I have so
much stuff, eh?
