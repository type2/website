Subject: 1983 Vanagon

Hello all

First, I'd like to thank all those who sent me advice on my vanagon's 
engine rattle and compression.  On the basis of these comments, I 
believe that I have a better feel for the engine condition and 
consequences of failure.  Therefore, and I have decided to go ahead with 
the purchase.  

As far as treatment is concerned, well I think this van has spent some 
time standing and so I'll change the oil (I've noted the points about oil 
type and lifters) and run it for a while before investigating the 
compression issue further.  Just in case the problem is more terminal 
than I expect, I've joined the AAA.  I thought I'd also use some petrol 
additive, such as REDEX, and see if this helps - should be ok with the 
injectors?

As I mentioned before, I intend to use this van for a trip across the 
states - I'm starting in New England, up to Canada, then back and west 
through Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas and Nebraska, 
and then back down south east through Tennessee,etc. and ending up in 
Alabama.  The condition of my engine makes me think that I ought to have 
some idea about where to get spares, such as Cylinder heads, water pump, 
etc., before I set off.  Can anybody recomend sources for spares in any 
of these states?  Similiarly, is there a larger VW club that I ought to 
be aware of/ join?

Finally, if the engine does go bang earlier than expected, for example 
starts leaking water, are there any emergency fixes that you can 
recommend, for example a version of RADWELD (temp radiator repair fluid) 
for cylinder heads?  What about the fuel injection system, is this 
reliable?  

Thanks again for your comments.

Tim
