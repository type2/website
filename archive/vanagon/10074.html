Chris Chubb asked about the pizza feast in Northern Virginia!!!

I certain others will respond but A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL!

There were four of us in attendance, with reasonable apologies from two 
others.

We came, we ate we &quot;showed&quot; our vans.
The range of equipment was quite respective:

	1 Air-cooled
	1 Vanagon
	1 Eurovan

All had their own 'personality' touches and dreams for the future. :)

I think consensus was that we'd like to get together again ... sooner 
rather than later! Time, place &amp; purpose to be determined.

I'm personally planning to do some camping in the Blue Ridge area in a 
couple weeks and invite anyone willing to join me.

CHRIS =&gt; seems we travel im simlar circles, I'm leaving Thursday for Saint 
Louis. Will meet with a member of the Mid-West contingent (Sami, couldn't 
figure a more humorous way to put it).  :)
