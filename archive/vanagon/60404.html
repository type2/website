Kenneth or Karen		
Congratulations. I know exactly how you feel :-)  I'm still like the mother
looking at her first born every time I glance out to the driveway and see
mine-calling to me, &quot;come on, let's go&quot;!

Don't try to glue the roof seals.  If they are sagging tape them up
temporarily with some packing tape until you get new ones.  They have a
metal clip built inside of them, much like a bobby pin arrangement.  The
original ones were made of steel and eventually rusted away which is why
they are sagging.  If you get a new set from Bus Boys or The Bus Depot the
will be made with either stainless steel or aluminum clips so they won't
rust out.  Seals for the top were under $100.00 when I bought them last
year.
Cant' help you with the A/C but I'm sure another member will!
