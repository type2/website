Gerry has been working just fine for over a week now. He was down for
about 3 weeks prior to last week. So if you were subscribed you should be
and should hvae been getting VANAGON list mail.

... keep in mind that you're part of a group of &quot;special&quot; listees
who get their access through one of several ISP's on our (VANAGON LIST
adminstrators) &quot;GRAY LIST&quot;. Approximately 80+% of our mail delivery errror
messages come from only 2-3 Internet nodes (e.g., AOL, Compuserve). Most
of these are &quot;FULL MAILBOX&quot; or &quot;ADDRESSE UNKNOWN&quot; errors. It is currently
our policy (at that of other admins) to simply remove each problem
addresses from the list (as opposed to restricting access from these
nodes! Ouch!). If the listee is really interested in staying on
the list, they can simply resubscribe. It's easier for us to have the
listees maintain their own accounts, than for us to constantly
monitor the 700+ subscribers.

Cheers,

from your VANAGON List admins (Ron, Chris ... and retired silent partn'r
Gerry)
