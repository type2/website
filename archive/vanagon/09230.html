&gt;Simple problem, looks like a difficult answer. The light on my Tach went
&gt;out and my '86 Owner's manual tells me how to replace almost every other
&gt;light on the vehicle EXCEPT the instrument lights.
&gt;It would SEEM tobe simple, but... is it?

if you mean the little light in the upper side of the tach 'hole', it's
pretty simple. if you have a replacement bulb. :)
take the top of the instrument pod off ... if you don't already know how,
there are two little grip-holes along the back edge of the cover. grip these
with your fingers and pull toward you (sitting in the driver's seat) and
upward at the same time. you have to pull pretty hard.

once the cover is off, you'll see the printed circuit flexible foil running
around in there, under a white/clear plastic shield. you can take the shield
off if you want (but you'll have to disconnect the brake reservoir level
sensor wire). anyway, look about where the light for the tach is and you
should see a little black thing that seems to be holding the printed circuit
foil to the tach housing. turn this black thing (it's a bulb holder) 90
degrees ... doesn't matter which direction ... like a key in the ignition.
that will line up the release slots and you can pull the bulb holder out and
replace the bulb. then reinsert it and turn 90 degrees again. once you see
how it works, it sorta makes sense. ;)

hope it helps.
