Subject: Re: Garage door opener woes

Sue sez:
/  Our garage has a vintage Genie door opener which performed quite
/  well until recently.  It started opening and closing of its own
/  accord.  Our neighbors said that it might be picking up someone
/  else's signal but this was happening late at night when the
/  street was empty.  Also, it would open and close several times
/  in succession.  We ended up unplugging it most of the time but when
/  it is plugged in, it opens or closes almost immediately all on its
/  own.  Has any of you has this kind of experience?  If so, what was
/  the prognosis?

When we lived in VA beach, the former owners had installed an el-cheapo
garage door opener. 

Aircraft landing radar would set it off. Whenever the wind was from
the south (airplanes landing over house) the garage door would
go up[ and down. My Dad was going to make a weathervane that would
turn the unit off when the wind was from the south.
