Subject: Westy interior electrics, final solution

Thanks to all who responded with ideas on the balky power to the water pump. 

As it turns out there was a faulty device on the L.E.D. panel that was
blocking power to the pump. I suspect this gizmo was some sort of switch
designed to block power to the pump when the tank is empty. There was some
heat discoloration to the board as a result of this thing frying itself. I
resoldered the yellow wire leading to the pump to a point where it was in
line with the red power input line thus taking the gizmo out of the loop.
Voila, all is right with the panel and the downstream water functions for the
first time since I've owned this thing.

FYI, Busboys told me that a replacement for that panel would run about $300!
