The seller must have heard everyone running down his price.  I just 
noticed in the paper today that he's dropped the price $1500 and will 
probably go lower.  Here's the relevant details for those that are 
interested.

VW Syncro Vanagon 1989, 4x4.  115k.  Excellent condition.  A/C, tape 
deck, PS, PL, PW.  Asking $8500.  (970)221-9124.

Once again, the van is located in Fort Collins, about an hour north of 
Denver.  I'll be glad to go and give it the once over, lightly, for any 
that are interested.  I haven't seen it and don't know the owner so deal 
direct initially.

Jack
