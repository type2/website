Subject: Re: Westy manuals

&gt;I'll be happy provide a copy of the parts catalog to anyone.  I will
&gt;demand something in return &gt;;^} My own bus prefs lie south of 1972, so I
&gt;wouldn't be interested in any lit later than '71.  No offense....
&gt;
&gt;I hereby promise SNIP!

can we hold you to this joe ;) ?? And yes those manuals are sized to metric
sized paper, so you will have to shrink them slightly to fit to 8&quot;x11&quot;.
Could you put my name on one of those copies. Much obliged

I have a copy of the 67' Westy manual to send you
