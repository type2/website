Subject: VW Micro-Bus Repair Books...

	Can someone recommend a book specifically geared toward repair
AND maintainence (sp.) of older VW vans (like the micro-bus)? 
	OF MAIN CONCERN is the fact that I'm NOT mechanically 'informed'-
so it'd need to be like one of those 'VW's for Dummies' or 'Idiot's Guide...'
etc...
	I hope someone can make some good recommendations here. I know it's
pretty specific, but there MUST be something out there!!!
	I'd appreciate E-MAIL responses directly to me at 
FASO101_at_ACAD3.ALASKA.EDU
	Thanks!
