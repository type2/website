&gt; &gt;Does anyone have any recommendations for a replacement system? For

&gt; &gt;fit?
&gt; 
&gt; uhhhh... i don't think anything off a 914 will fit the water-boxer engines.
&gt; the cylinders are closer together on the bus.  now the air-cooled vanagons
&gt; of 1980-1983 might be able to get away with using 914 components.

Thanks Joel. As usual, your advice is right on the mark and I
appreciate both your passion and knowledge of Vanagons.

For the sake of providing additional Vanagon information and
knowledge, I will describe what was done to repair my exhaust system.

First, I think the advice that was given a couple days ago (or was it
weeks?) regarding finding a mechanic first and *then* look for your
Vanagon should not be overlooked. Vanagons will run tremendously *if*,
and this is a big if, the fuel injection system is properly tuned.
This means all injectors, sensors and the like. These engines really
can purrrrr so nicely if all is right. It takes a very qualified
mechanic witgh proper equipment to pull this off. Some owners may fit
into what I call the &quot;qualified&quot; category, but if most other owners
are like me, I need a good mechanic. Fortunately, I have such a
mechanic. 

That said, lets get to my recent repair experience with the Vanagon.
It has 97k and the original exhaust system. I brought it in because
the Vanagon had exhibited a loss of HP at acceleration and highway
speeds.  I needed to keep it floored to maintain 60-65 mph on the
interstate.

My mechanic initially diagnosed the problem as a block in the exhaust
but he would know after he measured the back pressure in the exhaust.
After he measured it, sure enough, the back pressure was 14-17 PSI
when it should be 0-3 PSI. So his initial diagnosis was correct.

Since the vehicle had the orginal exhaust, he wanted to price an
entire exhaust system replacement including the headers. He was very
surprised to find that the retail cost from the dealer for this was
$2183!!!

Needless to say, this was an exhorbitant price so he started to check
other options. He could find a muffler from Walker for $147 and a
catalytic converter from Maremeont for $220. So far so good. But after
calling all his header suppliers, noone stocked or made the headers
for the Vanagon. (This mechanic is also a hot rod builder so he works
with the big name exhaust firms such as Ansa and Monza so I know he
did a thorough search).

Since the headers were in decent shape with minor stress cracks where
they coonected to the exhaust system, he decided to repair them. The
repair options were:

1. Bead blast, tig weld the cracks, paint the headers with header
paint.

or

2. Bead blast, tig weld the cracks, send the header to a hot rod
specialty house to have it dipped and coated.

Since the turn around on option 2 was six days, and I leave tomorrow
for Cape Hatteras, I chose option 1. The exhaust system is now all
back together and should hopefully last another 100K.

My mechanic said we could get away with this type of repair because
German made exhausts have a higher content of nickel and chromium.
This means they wear out much slower than either American or Japanese
manufactured exhausts. Anyone care to comment on this statement?

While he had the Vanagon, he replaced the coolant temp sensor. This is
interesting because I told him there was a recent thread about this
topic on our mailing list.

He also discovered the alternator bracket had cracked. With the
location of the alternator, it apparently has a tendency to flex,
especially when the engine doesn't idle perfectly.

It is easy for anyone to see when the alternator bracket has cracked.
Beside the obvious, (looking for the crack), the alternator will
vibrate much more than the engine when the idle is fluctuating if the
bracket is cracked. The repair is either replace the bracket, or weld
the crack.

So, the Vanagon is running tremendous, and my wife and I are taking
off for a windsurfing vacation to Cape Hatteras tommorrow. :-)**2

BTW, if anyone in the Rhode Island area, or any other area for that
matter, would like the name of this mechanic, it is: John Conti,
401-781-5770, Cranston RI.

Pray for Wind.
