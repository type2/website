Subject: Re: I'm confused about '79s

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sami mentioned this in a recent post:
&gt;&gt;
 I have
&gt;&gt; never seen a bay window bus that didn't have any of those panels behind the
&gt;&gt; front seats (except when they had been chopped out by the owner) and when I
&gt;&gt; see body panels in parts catalogues they are listed as suitable for 73 to 79
&gt;&gt; models. This even includes the front panel, so where did the extra inches go?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;  The panels behind the front seats were certainly gone , at least in the
&gt;  Westfalia conversion, by the late '70's. I suspect it was in '76, when the
&gt;  camper layout changed. Swivelling front seats and the little front table
&gt;  were part of the dining set-up . I'll take a peek at a late 70's passenger
&gt;  bus next time I see one and look for the panels  if no-one on the list
&gt;  clears this up in the meantime.

Great.  I love to clear stuff up.  My 79, purchased from the original
owner, is a plain-old 7 passenger Bus, and there are no panels behind the
seats, and no evidence that there every were any there.  Considering how
this Bus was mostly pampered, I'm sure no changes took place.
