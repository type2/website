Subject: Replace Headlights?

On the subject of improving headlights on the Vanagon...
I seem to remember someone recommending replacing the lamps with Hellas.  My 84
has Sylvania lamps now.  What Hella lamp would be a direct replacement for
these, and would such a move be likely to improve lighting (I know there is the
issue of low voltage in the wiring, but I'm not ready to re-wire yet)?

In JCWhitney they show two types of Hella H-4 Quartz-Halogen Headlights, ranging
in price from $17 to $25 dollars, which they say are for &quot;off-road use&quot;.  They
also show a Hella &quot;Vision Plus High Performance Halogen Headlight&quot; with an HB2
bulb to replace &quot;existing H6024 or H6054 headlights&quot;, running $40.  Any advice
on what I should buy?

Thanks to all.
