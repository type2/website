&gt;I have a slight leak somewhere around the gas tank, it only spills out when
&gt;she's more than 1/2 - 3/4 full.  I smoke so you could imagine what kinda
&gt;problems that could cause.  Any help would be great.  Also I need to know
&gt;about company's that sell the peices needed to convert it to a camper
&gt;(sinks, fridge, etc).  She already has an A.C. hookup so the process has

Hey Don...Errr... Jason,   As for the FAQ,  I'd suggest rahter you picking
up the idiot manual, it has all the Faq's you can imagine.  Next... Your gas
leak is more than likely from the filler neck hose connection... I have a
'73 Super Beetlwe that has the &quot;left turn indicator&lt;&quot; that is... when I make
a left turn with more than say 1/2 tank... well ...let's just say you can
smell the turn.  You should'nt have to worry too much about it, but I
suppose any gas leak is bad.  I don't know of ant companies that sell camper
conversion &quot;Kits,&quot; but rather some companies (used to anyways)  take your
van or vehicle or bus or whatever and turn it into a camper (pop-top) of
sorts.  Nevertheless if you wanted to do it your self.  I have a '71 Westy
that is going to go to the crusher within the next couple of months.  Her
pop-top (fiberglass) and the canvas tent are in very good condition.  I also
have a fridge from another Bus, but its an aftermarket sink/icebox.  All
you'd have to do is cut a hole in the top of you Bus and you'd have a
Bastard Westy of sorts.   If you wanted any of this stuff you could have it.
I live in Carbondale,IL.
