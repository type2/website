Subject: Score!  I got my seat....

Well I got the seat I was looking for.  The westy seat that goes behind
the drivers'.  I attended the Litchfield meet in CT yesterday.  Wow. My
first meet.  I got the seat for $15 (actually, my deluxes' previous owner
bought it for me)  I spent the early part of this morning (7 AM, with my
daughter) installing it while Grace listened to &quot;Ernie Gets Lost&quot; (over and
over) on the tape deck.  Needless to say, I was late for werk... (I can
never get that word right)
