&gt;Tim &quot;sniveling little git&quot; Smith has the audacity to type:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;PS: this is the only politically correct solution, pleases all, except those
&gt;&gt;EuroVan fools (ooops, donning my assbestos underewar now!)
&gt;
&gt;Well Tim, I realize that this is only YOUR opinion, and as Groucho
&gt;Marx once said: &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everybody has one,
&gt;and usually its the other guy's that stinks&quot;
&gt;
&gt;EuroVan fools indeed!  ;-)

Hee Hee Hee, sorry, I guess my solution/answer wasn't as politically correct 
as possible. In time I will buy a Eurovan, no doubt. So apologies extended 
to all EV owners. BTW: I really do like the appearance of the older buses 
&lt;'79 best, despite owning 2 vanagons!  There, now I've insulted a wider 
audience.  tim s.
