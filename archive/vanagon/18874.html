Subject: Re: [?]/Strange American VWVan Look-alike


I've recently seen a couple of Greenbrier (?) vans recently.  One was a 
double-door panel and just yesterday I spotted what looked like a custom 
camper conversion.  But why are we talking about Corvairs?  Don't their 
motors turn the wrong way? ;)
