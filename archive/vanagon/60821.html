Subject: Vanagon quirks-US vs Germany

Head gasket problems are certainly something that almost all owners of
Vanagons in the United States have or will have to face.  I'm just
wondering if head gasket problems are as common in Germany and Europe as
they seem to be here in the US.  I remember reading somewhere
(Transporter--Limbo newsletter maybe) that the leaky head gasket problem is
almost unheard of in Germany--Anyone have any opinions on this?
