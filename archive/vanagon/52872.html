Subject: vibrations

Hi,
my 85 Westy has a nasty habit of creating a very loud vibration right 
above my head when I take her up over seventy. I thought it might be 
the bungy cords I have up there but when I took them off it was much 
worse...sometimes it creates just a slight vibrational noise, other 
times like a jackhammer...what's going on? Thanks for any advice,
Rick
