Subject:      vw's for sale (Bishop, CA)

on a camping trip to Mammoth Lakes, CA, i ran into this older fellow who
said he and his wife were wanting to sell their vw's. they live in Bishop,
CA.

1972 Bus, 7-passenger,
     Sierra Yellow/White top, extremely good body condition (the ONLY
     detraction was the sand pitting on the front &quot;face&quot;). all the glass,
     rubber, chrome, etc. is in excellent shape. even the interior, seats,
     rubber mats, and especially the headliner are in almost showroom
     condition. the bus looks no more than a year or two old.
     124,000 miles. factory rebuilt engine (20,000 miles ago). owner's
     manual and a little vw owner-fixit manual that i'd never seen before.
     original dual carbs, oil bath air filter. good wheels and tires.
     i did NOT drive the bus, so i can't say how it ran or stopped. but if
     any of you know the Mammoth Lakes area, he made it down to and back
     out of the Devil's Postpile area. :)

1966 Beetle Deluxe,
     rear pop-out window option, 179,000 miles, all original except motor
     rebuilt 30,000 miles ago. he says the beetle is in better shape than
     the bus (didn't see the beetle).

his name is Ken Kaiser and his phone is (619) 387-2477. all disclaimers
apply: i don't know this guy from Adam, but he seemed sincere and friendly
enough, and the bus really did look great.
