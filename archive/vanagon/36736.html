Subject: 1600 Rebuild Notes...


All the gudgeon pins I've had any experience with tended toward tight--I
assume this is normally the case. When installing the pistons, Muir says to
bang the pins in. He's nice about it, he says to put something behind the
piston to soak up the shock, but basically you whang the mothers in there
with a hammer. That's the way I handled the last short block I did.

But I didn't like it. I know bearing material (in the rods, in this case)
is deliberately soft, and I can't see how it can withstand being levered on
with a force like that without ending up beveled. I don't care whether
you're just tapping, if it's enough force to push that pin through it's got
to be orders of magnitude *more* force compressing the edge of the rod
bearing.

Has anybody pressed the pins in with a huge C-clamp or something? Am I
being too prissy here?
