 &gt; Can your supplier of headlight covers also source &quot;ventwings&quot; or air
 &gt; deflectors for Eurovans?  I lust after a pair.
 &gt; &gt;&gt;

A &quot;ventwing&quot; aka &quot;front window air deflector&quot; aka &quot;rain deflector&quot; aka....you
get the idea...
is usually a clear or smoke tinted lucite or plexiglass &quot;air deflector&quot; kind
of thing that runs around the top, and front perimeter of the drivers and
parrengers front door windows.  This enables you to keep the windows
&quot;cracked&quot; open a bit without worrying about rain getting in or excess amounts
of air buffeting in the windows mussing up yer hairdue..  :&lt;)
Sort of the same principle as the sunroof air deflector bubble, (which by the
way I'm still looking for one for the large Vanagon sunroof)

These were manufactured by a myriad of companies, but the &quot;official&quot; \X/
authorized one is made by a German outfit called &quot;Clim-air&quot; and were custom
fit for the Vanagon.
Also, I'm still looking for any info on the above company....
