Subject: alt. &amp; OXS lights freaky

Okay, I've searched the archives to no avail on this one, even though I
know something similar was asked sometime around Thanksgiving.

Started yesterday, battery and OXS lights are coming on together. 
They'll stay on a while then go off and stay off a while.  Road
conditions (i.e. bumps) don't seem to affect it.  It was quite rainy
here the last couple of days.  Stormed real bad during the night before
this started and water got into a number of places it usually doesn't
(talking my house here--not the van!)  I was woken up in the middle of
the night by rain dripping from my ceiling onto my feet!  As such, I'm
thinking that maybe the wind was just right to get water behind my dash
somehow?  I think a couple of drops actually fell from the bottom of the
dash onto the floor while I was driving--reason for my suspicions.

If it was the rain, it's going to be a while before it dries up, since
it's kinda cold here now.  If it wasn't, I would appreciate any insight
ya'll can give me.  Seems like it has to be a short somewhere, just
don't know where.  Engine starts just fine, so I don't think anything is
really wrong with the battery or alternator and the belts look good, no
slipping.

Ideas?

TIA,
Tonya
