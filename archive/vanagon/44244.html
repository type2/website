Subject: MI VW ice cream run, Fri 6/14/96

Howdy Volks,

        some of us SE lower Michigan VW drivers are going for an ice-cream
run this Friday 6/14/96.  We'll meet at a place called Yesterday's
Collection, 5899 Jackson Rd. (between Zeeb and Baker, it looks like).
Jackson runs parallel to (and just south of) highway 94; there appear to be
exits at both Zeeb and Baker.  We'll meet at 6:30pm; the ice cream parlor
is open until 10pm (past *my* bedtime!).

        This place is both an ice cream parlor and a 1950s-ish memorabilia
center; I'm told that there are usually a couple of nice, old American cars
on display inside.  (They make cars in America???;)  If anybody needs
better directions, please drop me a line.

see you Friday,
-Greg
