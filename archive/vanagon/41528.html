Subject: Help! Fridge won't start on propane...

So Jones,Rich says:
&gt; 
&gt; .. and I leave for vacation in two days.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, so this past weekend I learned how to use the fridge, stove, water tank 
&gt; etc. on my newly acquired '89 Westie.  I was able to get the fridge to start 
&gt; on propane ONCE (the light came on and it ran fine for a couple of hours 
&gt; until I shut it down), but for the past couple of days, I've not had any 
&gt; luck getting it to fire up.  Things I tried:
&gt; 

I think the trick is to get the right amount of fuel to air pumping going.
I'd try by turning the gas level (temp knob) down to Min. and hold the
button in and pump the pump handle several times keep holding the button
in and the ingnition light flashing.  If it doesn't start, turn up the
gas level knob a little and try again.  Sometimes it takes alot of pumping
to convince the pilot to start.  I wouldn't turn the gas up too much if 
this is the problem.  I don't particularly agree with Tom's fast pumping
tactic either.  I think that just will give you a tired arm.  :)  You 
just want a good balance of gas and air.  Just hold that button and and
pump normally until the ignition light goes out.

Good Luck!
