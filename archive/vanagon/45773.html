Subject: Key Blanks  I got a source!

I can get all the Original Style Key blanks that we want.

  Any one that wants them e-mail me and I'm more than happy to ship you 
as many as you want.

  This NLA story that I and WE heard earlier in the week is not true!
  
  The price is 9.00 each and I'll figure out the easiest way to ship 
them possible.
