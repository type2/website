Subject:       Splittie Reduction Box Trauma

What I went through only two months ago, my friend Rich is going 
through today.  (A '64 Kombi)

Seems all the bolts but ONE fell out of the driver side reduction 
box/swingarm assembly.  I got under there last night to install a 
couple new bolts, and noticed one bolt was sheared off.  ACK.  
Luckily it isn't the front bolt, but the bottom rear.  
After inserting the front bolt and finding that it just turns turns 
turns and doesn't sinch down, I grimmaced.  Hmm, just like my bus.   
I went to install the rear middle bolt.  Spin spin spin.  Ack.  Not 
good.

So I assume the next move is to obtain some 13mm bolts and a tap and 
size them up.

Funny thing is this.  On my '57 I bought a 12mm tap and that fixed 
it.  Are my bolts 11's?  Or did the 12 just clean up the mess enough 
to get a grip.  

So the question that I'm being asked that I don't know is, what is 
the pitch that I need on this new tap?

Any suggestions are welcome.  In a good flame would be welcome too... 
:)
