Subject: Re: VAN Tires and Tim's EV Nightmare



I replaced the Continentals on the front with 
the same tires at 50K (kilometers), 5k later I replaced the
other two tires with good Canadian Tires (Canadian Tire Motomaster)
all season radials.  At the same time I moved the almost new Continentals to
the back. 40 K later the Motomaster tires on the front look like new
and the Continentals are looking like they need to be replaced.


Take home message: Continental Tires don't last:
