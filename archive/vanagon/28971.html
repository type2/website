Subject: Re:Coolant Temp Indications

&gt; The coolant temperature warning light sometimes flashes when the gauge
&gt; needle is showing max temp, and sometimes when the needle shows normal
&gt; temp.

I had the same problem this last weekend, just a few days after I had
the dealer flush and fill my coolant (yeah, yeah, I know...)
Temperature gauge showed normal, right amount of coolant in refill
resevoir (couldn't see into the overflow tank), no visible leaking,
tight V-belt, etc.  

I couldn't make heads or tails of the wiring diagram in Bentley - it
looked like only a ground leading to the warning light part of the
indicator, and the temperature sensor signal *only* (ie, no coolant
level sensor) leading to the &quot;gauge&quot; part.

The interesting part is that the flashing indicator went away each time
I turned off the engine and restarted it.  Is it possible that an
intermittent sender signal gets &quot;latched&quot;?  Also, this problem seems to
have disappeared now that I'm back down at sea level from 3000' to 7000'
where it was happening.
