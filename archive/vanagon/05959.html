  OFFICE MEMO          Bus seats for sale or trade            Date:11/1/94

I saw the following on another list yesterday and thought someone here might be
interested. btw, this is the first time I've posted to this list so let me
introduce myself. I'm Don Kane, been on the list for about a month. I'm
officially a wannabus and a used-to-have-a-couple-busses(61 and 68) and if my
plans work out I'll have a bus by the new year. I'm located in San Mateo Ca and
work in Mountain View.

&gt;OOOH! Treats!

&gt;I have two seats for my 79 transporter bus that I need to pawn off....
&gt;I have turned my little baby into a camper and do not need one bench seat
&gt;as well as the one that goes over the back wheels, which comes in two
&gt;separate
&gt;parts.  Both are in EXCELLENT condition, I would sleep on them and eat &gt;off 
&gt;of them. Hrm. Anyway, what I *really* want is a trade for a windshield wiper
&gt;moter (or more exactly, an unbroken plastic worm gear) fitting a 79 bus, but
&gt;if you are not blessed with such an annoyance I will gladly releive you of 
&gt;your spare change so that I can order a new one or go junk yard shopping...

&gt;By the way, if you don't want the seats but can help me out, please do.

&gt;I don't have regular access to the net, the optimal way to reach me would be
&gt;by phone (216-791-8732), but I'll probably check my e-mail in about a week
&gt;and a half. yeah. :)
