Subject: Re[2]: The water heater project - showers

     &gt;or those with air-cooled Type II's that want to have heated water/ 
     &gt;showers in their beasts similar to Dave Garths magnificant system.  I 
     &gt;think alot of people will be interested in your results Lee.
     
     Andy tells us that his mate heated 10 gallons of water in 10 miles to
     a good heat - never mind the shower, I'm gonna have a bath!  :)
