This has come up before. I've been meaning to put a switch in to activate 
the brake lights when I touched the pedal because it's irritating to have 
to stomp on the brake to get the cruise control to release, but I've 
never gotten around to it.

The brake lights activate late because they are triggered by the master 
cylinder pressure and not by the movement of the pedal.
If anyone HAS put in a separate switch, I'd appreciate hints on this one.
