Subject: Passed Smog Test!

 Took Wilbur &lt;'74 Westy&gt; in for the CA Biennial Emission Test this morning.
 This is the first time it's been smogged since the new engine, carb rebuilds,
 Pertronix install, etc.

 My trepidation was unwarranted, it turned out - 

                      Measured        Max Allowable Emissions        Results
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Hydrocarbons       96 ppm               350 ppm                    Pass

   Carbon Monoxide     1.9%                 5%                        Pass

   Carbon Dioxide     10.5%

   Oxygen              4.9%

   Idle RPM             859



 Here's what the computer told the technician to look for in the Visual
 Inspection:


 PCV System
 Thermostatic Air Cleaner
 Fuel Evaporative Controls
 Exhaust Gas Recirculation
 Ignition Spark Controls
 Carburetor
 Air Injection Pump
 Air Pump Belt
 Air Injection Plumbing
 Air Diverter Valve
 Vacuum Line Connections to Sensors/Switches



 Oh, what a relief it is......
