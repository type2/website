Tom,

Strap those rascals to the struts!

Welding aluminum is a snap.  Either you talked to the wrong guy or the break
is in a tricky location.  Call around to transmission shops.  A lot of
trannys have aluminum cases and get welded up rather than junked when they
crack.  Also check under aviation maintenance (as you mentioned) and with the
boat people.  A lot of outboards use cast aluminum blocks, and boat-people
are always welding up their props after chewing off the tips.  That calls for
some quality welding.  If you know someone at the Smithsonian, see if you can
get a lead on the guys at the aviation O&amp;R facility at Silver Hill (or, at
least it usta be at Silver Hill).  They have the right tools and attitude.

To guarantee a perfect weld it's usually necessary to pre-heat the casting.
 A lot of shops just don't to fool with something the size of an engine
block.

Limit your search to those shops that specifically mention TIG welding; it's
the only way to go for thick sections.

Good luck with it.

-Bob
