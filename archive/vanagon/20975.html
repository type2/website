  As I cut, gas started coming out and I turned
  to avoid getting it in my eyes.  It went into my ear instead. Man did this
  hurt.  Massive ear ache for about 2 hrs.  I used a diluted solution of 
  hand cleaner/distilled water to flush it out. Its been two days and I've
  been wandering around south Boston.  Just kidding, careful with the GAS!

the hospital for 4 hours.  i have never felt so much pain in my ear.  it

ear went on and on.  definatly do not want that to happen again.
