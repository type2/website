Subject: splitwindow earings

	A friend (Jeanne) of my wife has started a new artsy-
craftsy hobby making earings from small model automobiles.  She
gave my wife a set consisting of a very nice pair of

		SPLIT WINDOW BUSSES

about 3/4 or one inch long on the end of a short dangly thingie.  The 
bus is suspended by a connection to its roof.  I thought they were kind
of neat looking, and immediately thought of this group.  We used to have a 
'67 (we owned it for 8 years) before we got our present '85 in 1986.
I still have a soft spot for the '67, but the heater is nice, the ac
is nice, it is quieter, etc.  The earing is a cream-over-red sunroof 
(21 window?), British model ( cargo doors on the left side).

	Jeanne has a a small number of these for sale, and I can post 
her e-mail addresss if any one is interested.  I have no interest in 
this other than I thought what Jeanne made looked kind of neat!  She
told me she has lots of other cars in her repertoire.  We work SCCA
races together, Jeanne and my wife work in timing and scoring, I work
as a corner worker (flagman).  I think she said she was asking $12 
for a set, and that includes packing and mailing.    She said the
wire part is gold plate over sterling silver, or she can  make them
with stainles steel wires.  She can also make keychains out of them.
