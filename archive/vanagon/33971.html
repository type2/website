I've found one place in the UK  that does pre-64 brake stuff - 

front cylinders  L41.12 **each**  (about $60 ??)
rear cylinders   L20 each
shoes all round L61
Grand total of   L265.46  --  that's about $400 ??  Plus postage &amp; packing....

They have to order this stuff from the US so it'll take about 2 weeks to come
through. And they say you *can't* get a rebuild kit for these cylinders. Can
anyone in the UK tell me otherwise?

Once I get the BLEEDIN' front brakes off :-) I'll try to do some damage
assessment &amp; see if I really need to spend this much. 

&gt;When St. Muir says just pry, he speaks the truth.

OK, I'll &quot;pry&quot; again this afternoon :-)

Thanks!
