At 01:26 PM 12/31/96 -0600, you wrote.  Got one price off the net
&gt;of $450.00 with my core.  Whoa, had no idea they were so expensive?
&gt;
&gt;So....looking for recommendations.  Should I go with the &quot;unguaranteed&quot;
&gt;work and hope for the best or just go ahead and &quot;bite the bullet&quot; and
&gt;get the rebuilt rack?  Perhaps there's another alternative?
&gt;
Try Pep Boys.  I think it's quite a bit less than that, AND it has a
lifetime warranty if you plan to keep your bus.
