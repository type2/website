Subject: interesting web site

I just ran across an interesting web site out there &amp; thought y'all might be
interested.  its Edmund's Used Car website and if you dig, you can find how
they value your bus (as far back as 85 model year).  I found their review of
my 90 camper interesting.  It ends with: &quot;...It appeals to few, costs too
much, and couldn't fight its way up the side of a wet speed bump.&quot;

hmmmm...  I think I take exception to that remark.

you can find them at http://www.edmunds_dot_com/
