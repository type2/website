Subject: interchangeability of ignition cylinders (key)

When I bought my 1970 camper, it didn't have any keys for the ignition.  The
previous owner had rigged the ignition whereby the driver touches two wires
together....
Anyways, can my local VW dealer still supply keys for me, or can I use the
ignition lock/cylinder from my scrap 1972 Super Beetle?

To what extent are the ignition lock/cylinders interchangeable between the
older VWs?
