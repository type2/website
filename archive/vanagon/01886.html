Subject: NEVER NEGLECT YOUR BUS

Hey fellow bussers,

Well i've learned a big lesson.  Letting a vehicle sit is not a way to
necessarily save money.  For +/- 2 years i neglected my bus.  And she is
not very happy about it.

So far i've had to replace brake hoses, calipers, disc pads, brake fluid. 
Now i've got to install a new muffler.  My brake lights are out - and this
is just after a State inspection; but i know how to fix this little
problem.  

I've got most of the day off tomorrow and i've promised to spend time on
the bus.  Now to check out those rear brakes.

So never ever neglect your bus.  Maybe i should write a song about this
and we can all learn it ;-)  

Randy, in the ^^^'s of NC
