                 A Little Theory About Balancing Front Wheels
               ***********************************************


Please excuse my weak english.

1. Check your wheel-bearings. Are they running smooth and easy?
	
	Yes: Continue
	No:  adjust/change them

2. Lift the wheel

3. Give it a twist so that it rotates for a while

4. Wait until it stops. 

5. Place a mark at the upside (use chalk)

6. Go to step 3 until you got at least 20 marks on your wheel.

7. Evaluation: Is there a shape? are the marks distributed in a special 
   way? 

8. Place a weight on the wheel. (available in Tire Shops)

If you got some time and patience you can do a better job than the people 
at the shop, because you balance all the rotating masses. 

have fun          Holger
