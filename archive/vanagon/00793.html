	One time, when I was extremely poor and desparate, I got 
my nuts off :) by removing the cotter pins, chocking the car
with a couple of blocks, setting the handbrake as fas as it could
go, and then started the car, and with one foot rammed on the 
brake, dumped the clutch with the motor revved up.  I had caluculated
ahead of time what gear (1st or reverse) I needed to be in for 
which wheel.  It took 3 or four tries, and then I was able to
use the ratchet and hammer and get it loose.  By the way, I also
put some liquid wrench AND WD-40 on it (the colors, the colors!)

	Like I said, I was poor and desparate.  I don't know if I
would recommend this to anyone, but desparate times call for
desparate measures...

Kombi resto update:  Found taillights and original &quot;holes&quot; for them,
and they're welded in.  Bus runs now, and drives, but I'm looking
for heater boxes.  Working on various dings and dents, and I'll
replace the rocker panels when I come back from HI in June.  Sunroof
should be here any day now, and I'll weld that in in June, too.

Seen on TShirt in Santa Cruz: &quot;If we were meant walk around naked,
we would have been born that way.&quot;
