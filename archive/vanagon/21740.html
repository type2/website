Rubber gloves, and safety glasses are also advised.

Plan ahead, think about what would you do if you accidently splashed some acid
on .
o  your cloths
o  your kid or pets
o  something nearyby

what would you want to have immediatly available to use on the spill.

========================


MURIATIC ACID.

Now, this stuff is dangerous, make no mistake. It will take the skin off
your bones as quickly as it will take oil out of concrete-- and it dissolves
the concrete, too. But nothing else eradicates the oils stains, that I
have been able to find.


Muriatic is available from most hardware stores, as is the acid brush.
But BE CAREFUL with it, and have a running garden hose ready at all times.
Maybe some baking soda, too.
