Hi Volks,

Geez, seems like I'm selling everything! As my sig implies, my wife
recently bought a '97 Golf Trek. Well, we went ahead and got another
bike and rack thinking it was time to replace the old trusty Schwinn's.
Well, we don't like 'em! Not to mention we need $$ for the adoption...

Anyway, here's the scoop:

one 14.5&quot; VW/Trek bike - new
one 16&quot; VW/Trek bike - new
one VW/Thule bike rack (fits all Golfs or Jettas)
two VW/Thule bike carriers that go on the rack above

The whole package was well over $1000. Best offer accetped.
