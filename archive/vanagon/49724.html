Subject: Fuel Injection Hose Diameters

I'm looking for replacement fuel injection hose for my '85 Vanagon and
getting some confusing answers to parts questions.

I have been told (by a certain highly placed listmember here who lives in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama) that the Vanagon uses 8mm hose, mostly, and 10mm hose
from the tank to the pump.

My parts guy says that they only stock fuel injection hose in 7,9 and 12mm
sizes.  Anything else is something he can't help me with, his hoses are
fabric covered, by the way, the stock hoses on my van are bare rubber.  I
don't have two cars anymore, so I can't exactly take the system apart and
drive the samples up to NOPI to match them (the Passat Variant is now long
gone--with happy owners in Massachusetts).

Anyone know what these sizes are for sure, and if they really are 8 and
10mm, where would I find this hose outside of the VW Dealer?
