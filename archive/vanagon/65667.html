Subject:      Problems with Hunter Syncro Specs

Hey Sean,

Derek Drew has determined that even though they list Syncros, the specs
on some Hunter machines are not correct.  Before folks trust their
Syncros to the Hunter specs, they should make sure they agree with those
he has posted, referenced on the Syncro Westie page:
