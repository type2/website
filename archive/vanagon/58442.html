Subject: Vanagon Recall Web Sight

Have you checked out the VW Vanagon recall notices from the NHTSA??
I saw atleast 3 recall notices having to do with the fuel system.  You 
may be able to get a free tank out of VW!

Check out this web sight:

There are a bunch that my 87 need done.  I am thinking about printing it 
out and heading to my dealer to see what they say about it......
