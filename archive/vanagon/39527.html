Subject: Waterboxer temp gauge

I bought a clock today to replace the non-working model on the 81. Turns out
this one is non-working too. I started to take it back but then figured that
the &quot;chassis&quot; was in so much better shape than it's crumbling predecessor
that it was worth keeping. I didn't pay enough to feel screwed, just slightly
irritated at the wasted effort.

Since this came from an 84, it has a temp gauge for which I have no use.
Should any one have a need for it, it can be yours for the asking.
