Subject: VW Factory Rep on List

Cetin Seren said,
 &quot;My '93 Ev has exact same symptoms...
Sounds like a VW of A recall is in order -- I'll see if I can follow
this up with VW of A once our move to Pittsburgh is complete...&quot;

  English is a required second language in most German schools, and 
the I-net certainly is part of the factory's current resourse base. 
I'd like to use what ever &quot;carrot and stick&quot; seduction/motivation 
that's required to get a genuine factory representive to participate 
and field some questions as a List member.  Even if this person were
a recently retired but still VW factory connected person, their insights 
would really be useful to a large bunch of people owning their iron.

  Any thoughts about how we can try to make this happen?  Our initial 
inquirys might best be delivered in perfectly native deutsch words.
How does this sound?

	John Wakefield
