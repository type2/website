Subject: Hurricane Fran vs. Rumab the VW bus

hey now,

i'm writing this as Hurricane Fran bears down on the NC coast. i've
obviously cancelled a day trip to Wilmington i had been wanting to take.
seeing as they have evacuated wilmington. the storm should hit the coast in
about 3 hours or so...then towards raleigh around midnight. last forcast i
heard was gusts of up to 50mph + 10-12 inches of rain expected. tornado
warnings all over the place. i get off of work about 12am-1am.

i can't imagine a class III huricane packing 115mph is gonna be all that
weak when it heads 2 hours inland. hmm, question is, will Rumba the 74
Retrowestie get me home without being blown off the road. anyone driven
a van in a hurricane before and are still around to talk about it? :-)
maybe they will let us go home early? i don't think a van is what you
want to drive if you have to drive in a storm like this.....
