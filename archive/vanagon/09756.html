Subject: Inline Heaters

All this talk of heater booster fans has brought my
desires for heat in the winter to an (ahem) boil.

I am wary of getting a *total* seal at the heater boxes,
as they have to move around a little bit at the
exaust pipes. So I want to install a pusher fan.
I should be able to install a fan that can push at least as
hard as the engine can, possibly harder, especially at
idle.

I would also like to install its intake under the rear seat,
in that fiberboard kick panel. Then route the tube out, by the
gas tank, and into the engine compartment, to hook to the heater boxes.
(Mabye even a 'Y' connector so I can have electric AND engine
blowing)

Has anybody else made this conversion. Where did you go through
the unibody under the seat and then how did you get into the
engine compartment? How strong a blower would I need?
