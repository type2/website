Subject: Syncro decals

I am going to scan my new Syncro decals (the &quot;syncro&quot; on the front and the
&quot;4WD&quot; on the doors) so that I can output them as colored decals. If anyone is
interested in getting a set I would charge $30 a set plus $2 postage. This is
a third of what the dealer wants for non color ones. This is a way to make
your Syncro look a little more unique, especially if it is white like mine
is.
