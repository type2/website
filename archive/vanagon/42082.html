Subject: Shift Questions

I do not have to push down the shift nob when shifting my '77 westy into
reverse.  What does this mean?  I don't recall it ever slipping out of gear.
Well maybe it would slip out of gear occationally in reverse when I just
started it in the dead of NY state winter.  Anyway, why don't I have to push
it down to switch into reverse?
