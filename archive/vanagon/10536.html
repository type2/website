Subject:       Silicone grease for rubber seals

&gt;  I think that the rubber seals may be
&gt; adhereing (sp?) together and was thinking of maybe putting on a thin
&gt; film of vaseline.  Any ideas or solutions would be appreciated.

GM makes a silicone based grease made specifically for lubricating 
rubber door seals.  This will probably solve your problem and it 
'dresses up' the look of the rubber a bit.  I had bought 4 tubes of 
it via surplus so I don't know if the General still carries such a 
product but it does work nicely.
