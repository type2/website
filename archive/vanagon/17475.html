Boy, some day I wish we could be like those wonderfuly
inspired west coasters (sigh), is anyone still interested in
trying to at least get out to BBTA in group form, even a
couple of Buses maybe? Hell I'll even travel with those
evil water pumpers if you swear not to leave me too far
behind.

Just wondering
