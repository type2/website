Yes, The top of the rad is the highest point in the cooling system.
The air is supposed to collect there.  But you might try checking...
Go around back(Engine end) And squeeze the rubberlike hoses that run
above the engine at the front of the engine compartment (Front is toward
seats)  If they feel hot (if a blister forms on your palm   ;)) there is
probably not any air left in the system.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You aren't sopposed to open the expansion tank with the engine running

&gt; Actually, if I open the expansion tank ANY time, it does that.  I know
&gt; there is SOME air in the system, because I can see it bubbling slowly 
&gt; into the expansion tank.

Well... Once the engine is cool again you could re-fill the tank...
The overflow tank should do this for you however.  Is it filled to the
line?  Over the line when hot?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've parked it back end high for initial filling, then front high for 
&gt; &gt; bleeding.
&gt; 
&gt; Thats the first I've heard someone say that. Ok second after Donald.
&gt; 

I don't have a bentley's or anything... I just did what seemed logical.
I've also done it on flat ground, on the side of the highway, here, there,
everywhere...    :(
