Subject: Re: AC Compressor for '85 Vanagon?



&gt;From: dbax_at_mindspring_dot_com (Donald Baxter)

&gt; Has anyone on the list had to find a new AC Compressor for their Vanagon.  I
&gt; have had mine at the AC shop waiting for one since Tuesday and although they
&gt; say one has been located and is being shipped, I am beginning to doubt their
&gt; word.  Will only one kind of compressor work?  Is VWs method of mounting a
&gt; compressor that specific?

I dont know if this will help, but Bob Hoy has been advertising A/C compresssors
on close-out for $103.00 in Hot VW's. I dont know if this would include the
Vanagon type. Their number is (800)289-4697
