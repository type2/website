Subject: Wipers redux

I'm still having fun with the wipers on my '88 Vanagon.
It started with the rear wiper not working at all and the front not working
on intermittent speed. Inspection reveiled that the rear motor had
self-destructed and the PO just unplugged the wire (probably after checking
the replacement price at the dealer.) Thanks to Kyle at Voks Motorsports I
got a used rear wiper motor, installed it, and I have a rear wiper again!
 However, when I move the wiper switch to intermittent for the front, the
wipers run at the normal 'slow' speed.

Does this mean I should replace the front wiper relay??

Thanks
