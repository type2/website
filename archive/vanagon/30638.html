Hey all,
	Well, it's getting to be that time of year again.  I'll be
	signing off the list for a while tomorrow and will be back
	around January 10th or so.  Over break, I will try to acquire
	both the Muir book and the Bentley manual.  If anybody remembers
	something that they just HAVE  to tell me, I can be reached at
	my mom's account, which is 76065.3075_at_compuserve_dot_com .  Hope
	everybody has a good Christmas (where applicable :) ).

	Sean
