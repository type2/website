Subject:       Re: EXTREME DANGER (was: Aluma-Seal Confessions)

&gt; I sincerely regret introducing this subject to the thread. It reveals
&gt; an effective way to violently kill yourself and everyone around you,
&gt; in a terrifying and uncontrollable way, while burning down most nearby
&gt; structures. Anyone lucky enough to escape death from a reaction
&gt; like this, can be maimed, horribly and painfully, for life.

Tsk-tsk.

Let's all sit back and relax.  The posting of the pyrotechnics FAQ 
information was very informative, and included appropriate warnings 
and safety infomration.

As a firm believer in freedom of infomration, I think we are all big 
enough and smart enough to handle the information presented to us.  
And hopefully we are smart enough excercize judgement in playing with 
very dangerous explosives.

Irregardless of the above, I find the eliteist comments such as, &quot;I 
know but I'm not going to tell you,&quot; offensive.

Anyone desirous to find information on how to blow up stuff can 
easily get it from many sources.  I don't think posting the 
aforementioned infomation on Vanagon is going to cause a breach in 
national security.

Just my old teenage hacker mentality re-surfacing...
