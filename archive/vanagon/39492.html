&gt;  AAA does not only &quot;help&quot; with the towing of vehicles but has more resources
&gt; to be explored. After a few years of paying them for not using their
&gt; services, I figured I needed to get some money back. So, to make a long
&gt; story short, I decided to give them a call and had them send me ALL of the
&gt; booklets that they have related to camping grounds not only in the US but
&gt; Canada, as well. It involves about 10 booklets filled with information of
&gt; many campgrounds in the nation. The cost of these little darlings if bought
&gt; from another source is about $5 per book. They have other things that are
&gt; sent if asked. Nothing is automatic with AAA. So, if you feel that you are
&gt; paying enough money and getting nothing, call them or go to their nearest
&gt; office and inquire about anything that you can take home without dishing out
&gt; any more money. I feel that it is a way to get something back for the money
&gt; that I have &quot;given&quot; them.
&gt; 
&gt;  Go for it now!

Also ask for maps of every state and province and major city.  In addition to the 
camp books they have Tour Books (I think that's what they're called) which give 
lists of things to do and see in the state/province.

If you do travel then AAA/CAA is worth the money.  You can easily get your money 
back from maps and books.  Also if it's too cold to stay in your bus/van go to a 
motel that's AAA recommended and ask for the AAA discount.
