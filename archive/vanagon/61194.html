Karl,

  I have one on my '85 westy. It is a comercial unit made by &quot;DA'LAN&quot;.
They are in Shirley, MA according to the sticker on the hitch. I 
just went into a local hitch shop and that is what they had for my westy.

&gt; 
&gt; Saw (and took some pictures) of a bumper hooked to the tow hooks on
&gt; a Vanagon.  Looked like a slick setup since it looks it could
&gt; presumably be removed by taking out 4 bolts.  
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a commercial product?  The one that Bus Boys have requires 
&gt; drilling into the bumper supports.  I looks like it might be a custom 
&gt; job from a weld shop.  I'll put some pictures on my homepage when I 
&gt; get them back.
&gt; 
&gt; My application would be a light trailer with fiberglass 17' 
&gt; Daysailer.
