Subject: Westy at REI(Cupertino,CA)

     
     I'm not trying to resurrect the thread we had a month ago or so regarding 
     sightings of Westys(syncros or otherwise) in REI parking lots, however, I 
     saw one this past Saturday around noon.  It was located at the far end of 
     the lot; was an orange westy bus(maybe '75-'79?) with a list sticker on the 
     bumper.
     
     I parked next to it in my &quot;85 metallic tan westfalia. 
     
     Just curious and wondering who owns it.  It's always interesting to meet 
     someone with a common denominator.
