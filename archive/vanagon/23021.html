Subject: 6V Flywheels and Type IV Oil Temp

Dyer queries, &quot;I am also wrestling with 6 volt to 12 volt conversion question. 
I'm thinking of leaving it 6 volt for now and changing later.  I know I'll have
to drop the engine when I finally do convert so I can change the flywheel.&quot;

I say, &quot;Done this, been there, but I am far from an expert.&quot;  Actually, on my
'65 and later my '64 (which came converted) the stock 6V starters were left in
place and worked fine for many years.  The '65 still had the same starter in it
when it met its untimely demise after over 100,000 of my own miles, most of
which occurred after the 6 to 12 volt conversion.  On the '64, when the original
engine ate it, I foolishly ordered a rebuilt with 12V flywheel, which before
installation, required much time spent crouched up in the engine compartment
grinding out the old 6V tranny for clearance alnog with purchase of a 12V
starter and bushing, which of course I had none of in my spare parts box, though
I had a few of the 6V variety.  Though I agree that a 12V solenoid might be a
good idea, I never lost any flywheel teeth, nor noticed any excessive wear. 
This may all be flame-bait, but a stock 6V starter, IMHO, is just fine to leave
in place when doing the 12V conversion (I even seem to recall St. Muir saying
something to this effect).

Then, later Scoob wonders,&quot; whether or not to go with a dip stick style.&quot; 

And though I haven't been there, nor done that, I have a good friend that I'll
call Bob (well what else would I call a guy named Bob?) who is a bus novice who
looks to me for experience and advice regarding his '74 Westy.  When he had his
engine rebuilt, he asked if there was any instrumentation I could recommend that
might help in feel more comfortable driving about in the hot, California summer,
and of course, an oil temp gauge topped my list; however, I had no experience
with what was available for Type IV engines, so he went to his rebuilder (whom I
felt had been honest and straight with Bob so far) and he recommended the
Porsche type sender plate that someone else mentioned.  Bob had no trouble
getting one of these, since the rebuilder had several in stock, but ran into
problems on the installation.  It seems that the dipsticks on the Porsche and
the Bus must have different entry angles into the engine, as the dipstick on
Bob's Bus interfered with the oil temp sender.  Bob resolved the problem by
hacking off the lower tip of his dipstick and I'll have to admit the
installation looks slick, as it is made just for this application.  Bob has had
some problems with sealing on this unit, but this may be due to his mechanical
inexperience more than anything else.

About Phish, both the Deadheads and non-Deadheads in The Keepers of the Golden
Heart (shameless plug for the band I do sound for) like and admire Phish, and
since we are mostly old phogies (nobody under 30, mean age of 36) I guess that
means that there is still good music being made that us old pharts can
appreciate (don't ask me to stop listening to Neil Young, though).

Back to the Grindstone now,
