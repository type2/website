&gt;Perhaps someone on this list can help me out with this.  Whenever,
&gt;the weather turns colder after a warm spell or the cold is combined
&gt;with high humidity, the sliding door on the van seals itself shut.
&gt;No amount of coaxing with free it.  The rear portion of the latch
&gt;releases but that is it.  I think that the rubber seals may be
&gt;adhereing (sp?) together and was thinking of maybe putting on a thin
&gt;film of vaseline.  Any ideas or solutions would be appreciated.

armorall can help a bit on the rubber gasket, but you might also want to
spray a bunch of wd-40 (or similar product) on the rear door mechanism ...
the grease back there can become cold and thick ... my 88 used to do that
until i used up about a half can of wd-40 on the little mutha. :)
