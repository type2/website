Subject: Sandblast!


Yesterday after work I finally broke out my sandblaster to clean up 
a couple of cargo doors to go on my 64 21-window.  The doors are my 
best pair, having been preserved by 5 or 6 coats of paint thru the 
years (which was my problem).

I was using 40 sand and it went really slow.  Took me over 3-1/2 
hours and 100lbs of sand to clean up one door.  It was amazing however 
that by regulating the air pressure I was able to take off one coat of 
paint at a time.  Original color was Pearl white, then red &amp; white, 
then blue &amp; white, then beige, then gold metal-flake, then brown.

The gold metal-flake was hilarious, not to mention the HARDEST coat of 
paint to remove.  Tonight I am going to strip the other door, but I am 
going to use 30 sand in hopes it will go quicker.  Totally wore out 
the ceramic tip on my blaster.  Shouldn't a tip last longer than 1 bag 
of sand?  I would welcome any advice and sandblasting tips anybody out 
there has to share.

Dave
