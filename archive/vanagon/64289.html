Subject:      Q:How do i drop the engine on my Vanagon?

does anybody know if you can drop a Vanagon engine with 4 jack stands and
a 3-ton floor jack?

i am putting another engine in the van and wasn't sure exactly how to do
it, so if anyone has any experience in that area, please explain how it
is to be done.

thanks,
