Subject: Speedo Cable Fitting

     This weekend I plan to fit a new speedometer cable to my '78 Bus. I'll 
     try and folllow the Idiot's guide.
     Has anyone any top tips for said idiot (thats me) on this operation - 
     is it easy is it hard,
     
     Also getting my seamstress friend to knock up some curtains and seat 
     covers - should be fun!
     
     Happy dubbing volks, cheers
