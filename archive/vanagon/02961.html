&gt;Joel, when you say oxygen sensor with and without connector, what do
&gt;you mean. Would all the one wire sensors listed be ok for the 82
&gt;west.?

from what i can figure, the one WITH connector has the little vw-specific
on it.  notice that the one WITHOUT connector didn't have a vw cross-ref
number.

now ... from what the FLAPS folks tell me, ALL the cars that are listed for
that one-wire sensor WITHOUT connector use the same exact sensor. so if you
get a one-wire sensor from a FLAPS that is made by Bosch and is 'for' one
of those cars (1990 chevrolet, for example), then yeah, it should be ok for
the 82 bus. only trouble is, you'll have to splice in a connector to fit
the vw wiring harness. and i don't know how much trouble that would be.
it might be easier to just replace the vw connector with some new FLAPS
connector. but the one-wires are much much much cheaper from the FLAPS than
from the vw dealer, and they are still genuine Bosch (if you ask for it).

since mine takes 3-wire sensors, :(  i haven't tried it yet.
