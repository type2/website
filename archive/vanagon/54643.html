Subject: front wiper hose replacement

Having already checked the archives for 1996, I would like to know if any list 
member has ever replaced the front wiper hose to an 86+ vanagon?  I took the 
resevoir down, cleaned it all out, and got the pump to spit out some fluid.  
I'm guessing that the lines must be clogged or something since the passenger 
side does not squirt and the driver side only barely squirts.

Basically, can you get to all of the connection points through the front grill 
or from under the dash?  or must you remove the dash?  Any recommedations on 
new hoses?

Thanks list members,
Karl
88 Vanagon GL
I saw stats on 5 Dallas area members.  Anyone want to get together over a 
couple beers?
