Sounds like maybe a bad pump or restricted filter. Try flushing the 
system with ATF, clean or replace filter &amp; top up. To flush, remove 
return line to PS tank, then have someone crank the engine (remove 
coil wire so it doesn't start) to pump the old fluid into a 
container. Don't let the tank go dry - top up with new fluid &amp; repeat 
a few times until clean fluid comes out the return. Mine took about 1 
1/2 qts to flush &amp; fill. I was able to clean the filter by rinsing in 
solvent.
