Subject: Sorry to leave

My work load has gotten so bad that I can no longer handle the high volume of
e-mail that being on this list brings, so with a sad heart,
I leave you all.  I'll miss Joel's rantings, Ric's ravings, and Martha's
musings, along with all the inspired thoughts from everyone else,
so I hope to return soon.  I am definitely going to join the
Bricks across America on some portion of a leg out west here, so I
will be back before then.

So long for now,
Terry - '64 Camper
