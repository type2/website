Subject: &quot;New&quot; camper 2nd report

About a week ago, I posted my first report on my new to me '81 Vanagon
Westie.  I had several questions, and folks here were great.  Thanks very
much for all the help.  Here are the problems I reported and the solutions
that worked

&gt;First, when I start it, it takes several seconds (maybe 7 to 10) for the
oil light to go &gt;out and the buzzer to quit.  Then, if I let it idle too
low during the first minute of so &gt;it is on, the light will flash again.

Joel Walker told me to check for a Fram oil filter and get rid of it.  That
cleared up the problem.

&gt;Second, the spedo sticks.  When I accelerate, it comes up much slower than
my actual &gt;speed, and when I slow down, it may not drop at all, frequently
remaining at 30 or 40 mph &gt;even when I have stopped.  The odometer works fine.

Several people gave me advice, and I took it apart and lubed it.  It works
now, but I have to adjust the spring tension, as it is reading *way* low,
but this problem seems to be in hand.

&gt;Next item -- there is a rubber boot connecting some sort of housing on the
back of the &gt;alternator to the body on the inside rear by the passenger
side taillight housing.  It &gt;looks like some sort of air intake.  It has
come off, and in the limited space available, &gt;I am having trouble putting
it back on.

Again, several people suggested solutions, and the one from Jeff Carver, to
put it on the body first, and then the alternator, did the trick.  I was
trying to do it the other way.

In recent years, I have become a &quot;take it to the shop&quot; kind of guy, but
with all the great people here, I have decided to do all the work on the
Westie myself.  I hope I wont seem like too much of a bother, as I am sure
I will be here asking a lot of questions you may have heard before.

I'm not completely ignorant about auto mechanics.  In the past I have done
a lot, including removing, completely rebuilding, and replacing an engine,
but it was all &quot;American heavy metal.&quot;  No Volks experience.  Also, I have
a good friend with a '79 van, and I was always kidding him about it.  He
has sure been having fun the past couple of weeks.

My next project will be to track down an oil leak on the passenger side of
the engine.  It seems to be above the exhaust pipe on that side, as it
drips down on the pipe.  Any sugestions as to where to look first?

Thanks again,

Bill
