Subject: Re: Fram Oil filters

David &quot;Fram-meister&quot; Schwarze states:

&gt;I always use Fram filters now.  A long time ago I bought another kind of

This is interesting, as I am working at this from the opposite angle;  I 
used to use Fram filters until the FLARS (New Dimensions, Santa Clara CA)
kept ragging on Fram filters (going back to what Steven J. said about the
bypass valve), and some other stuff about filtration going down to 8 microns,
or something like that, so now I'm going the OEM route and using either the
Mann or Mahle oil filter for our '91 GLI/GTX and '93 T4.  Some of you may
recall that I posted a query about oil changes about 1.5 months ago, and
based upon some of the responses I opted for neither a Fram nor an OEM filter,
but a WIX filter instead (because the OEM Mann/Mahle was about $10, not that
the WIX filter was all that cheap either, but the WIX was more readily 
available, and its specs are supposed to meet, if not exceed the OEM German
filters).

Anyway, 'sorry about getting sidetracked there, but the important thing is
probably to see if you can take a look at a cut-away profile of all the 
filters and decide for yourself how fine you want the filtration to be, and
whether or not things like bypass valves are important to you.

I've never had a bad experience with a Fram filter, so I can't carp on it
too badly, but I figure if a Mann/Mahle filter goes bad, I can always say
to VWoA  &quot;uhh, well, I WAS using your filter when all the oil drained out
and the engine seized!...&quot;   ;-)

You know, I get the feeling that this topic is like talking about religion,
politics, and sex on a date.
