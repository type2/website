Subject: PartsPlace

Well... after hearing about PartsPlace on the list, when I saw a post on  
one of those newsgroups for VWs for a catalog.  So I thought, &quot;What the 
hell.&quot;  Well, I got it ($2 postage) and it had a 15% certificate for 
Internet users on the cover.

They got a bad report from someone on the list, but I figure I'll try 
them out for a couple basic things.   Like I need a steering dampner for 
the '77, which is $27 local, $15 from PP.
