Subject: Re: New CJVs: How stiff is TOO stiff?

When I rebuilt mine, I discovered it is possible to assemble these things
wrong.  They will slide in and out, but will not tilt one iota.  You might
want to check that they were assembled properly in the first place. 
Compare it closely to a known good one, or even with one of your old ones.
