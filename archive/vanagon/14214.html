Subject: Re: rhubarb frame - was: restoring interior chrome

that should leave this sorry tale about rhubarb to rest! maybe i shouldn't
have started this thread in the first place! anyways, one more vote for
rhubarb pie!


&gt;Oh for the love of Mars, folks.  Rhubarb isn't *that* toxic--the greens do
&gt;contain a very high amount of oxalic acid, which interferes greatly with the
&gt;body's ability to absorb nutrients.  If you eat it it'll probably make you
&gt;sick, but I don't think you'll be laid out in a pine box by merely touching
&gt;the leaves.  I never have been, at least I don't think so.  :)
