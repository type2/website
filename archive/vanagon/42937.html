Hello all,
Today I installed two more windows on my '78, the sliding door sliding window provided by Ron Salmon and the rear hatch window that I scavenged off of Steve's dead '79.  Putting in the side window went well, but the string broke half way through and I had to fake it the rest of the way.

Doing the rear hatch, my dad suggested using two strings (or one piece folded over to make two effective strings) in the lip to pull it around.  Tried it, along with copious amounts of dish soap, and it zipped right in!  two strings is definitely the way to go.  I wish I'd have known that a few windows ago :( .

I'm taking a little break now, but in a few minutes I'm going to go to Wal-Mart and buy a generic black floormat and attempt to cover the gaping holes in my engine tin from where the spot for the compressor was hacked.  Should help me run much cooler.

See ya,
Sean
