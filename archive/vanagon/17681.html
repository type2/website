Yeah, That's your &quot;relay ball&quot;,
Don't ever start your van without it in place.

Just Kidding.  :)
I've been into a few starters and relays, but have never seen somthing
like what you've described.
I think that it's probably somthing that got kicked up off the road,
and lodged inself in a position to fall out when you pulled the relay.

I hope so at least.  Otherwise you'll be mad when you discover that
it IS your ever important &quot;relay ball&quot;
