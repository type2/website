&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: The Plan - Do This on February 29 *IMPORTANT*
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Priority: urgent
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; To whomever may read this,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; This is not a typical chain letter, in that by passing it on to as
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; many people as you can, you are taking part in what may yet become the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; world's biggest practical joke. The U.S. Government has recently
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; passed an act which enforces censorship on the internet. A group of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; internet users has now come together to kick back at this oppression,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and have a bit of fun at the same time. The aim of this exercise is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to re-establish the United States as &quot;The land of the Free&quot;, not a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; fascist state where freedom of speech and thought are curtailed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Communist Russia fell as a result of such limits being placed upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the minds of the general populus. On receiving this letter, please
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; pass it on to as many friends or E-mail lists as you can. We predict
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; that if everybody copies the letter to 5 other addresses, by February
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 29th 1996, this letter should have reached in excess of 2 million
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; people. That's when the fun begins...... On February 29th, please send
&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; following message which includes a copy of the Bill of rights. By sending
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the letter on the above date, you will contribute to either one huge
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; petition for freedom, or else lead to a crash of the whitehouse server.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Send all letters to:    President_at_Whitehouse_dot_gov
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember that solidarity is the key to success !!!!!
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Mr. President,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you remember this:
