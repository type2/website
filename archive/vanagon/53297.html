Subject: Re: Raceware Head Studs

&gt;	I have heard a lot about RACEWARE studs for the Wasserboxer heads.
&gt;Supposedly they have been able to stop the leaky head gasket syndrome.  

OK, let's look at this....

in order to use RW studs you have to install them right?
so you are definately replacing at least the head gaskets anyway?
this is what 'saves' the heads!!
unless your studs are rusted to ribbons and likely broke when you took off
the nuts, there is no reason to replace the studs. If replacing one, just
use the OEM plain janes. They should give you another 10 years.

RW studs may have a place in VW/Porsche etc engines, but they are NOT the
solution to wasserboxer probs, or even a significant part of the solution.
Change the coolant every other year, and when you put new heads on get some
kind of inert coating (ceramic/JBWeld) on the heads gasket face. Tim
