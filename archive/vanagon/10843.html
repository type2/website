Subject: Where I've been - Lee.G

     Hi folks,
     
     Yes you guessed it, I've not been around for a while.
     
     And it's only a matter of time before an unattended Web server
     gives up!
     
     Well I'm back now  (1600 email massages to read - gulp) and the 
     server's fine.
     
     Reason for my absence: Crown Court Jury service - no option.
     
     Lee.
