Congratulations are in order:, I'll be glad to save young Lars my 91 GL,
last of the bread, maybe by then VW will have come to it's senses and
re-introduced something Vanagon-like again for me to step up to?

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm new here on the list, even I'm just born on last Friday.
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for a crazy camper within the next 18 years, when
&gt;I will get my drivers license. Does anyone save me his full
&gt;equipped Vanagon? I love the waterworld, I'm born in a wonderful
&gt;warm bath, but a missing a surf-board. The Vanagon must be capable
&gt;to carry a board on the roof, I do not want to miss one in future.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a solution for small drivers? I'm 55 cm tall
&gt;and my wight is near 4 kg. I decide to grow up fast, but, if
&gt;anyone have a solution, please e-mail my father given in the
&gt;mail header.
&gt;
&gt;Will be nice to here from you.
&gt;
&gt;Lars Zeidler
&gt;Wannabus
