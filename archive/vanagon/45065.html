Subject: Oil leaks

I recently purchased a 1977 type II transporter for the paltry sum of
$375. The bus is in wonderful condition except for a chronic oil leak. Oil
only leaks when the engine is running and continues for a short period
after the engine is stopped. The leak consumes approximately one quart of
oil every 75 miles of highway driving, but the rate also appers to depend
on how warm the engine is and ambient air temp. The oil is leaking from
the rear of the engine between the block and the fan shrouding. I replaced
the oil cooler and associated gaskets (o-rings) in hopes that this
expensive repair would quell the flood of oil from my engine. I also
replaced the oil filter and ensured it had a good seal, but the oil drips
WILL NOT STOP!!. I really LOVE my bus, but this is getting embarrasing (a
little trail of oil follows me wherever I go!) Any suggestions will be
greatly appreciated. The Idiot book advised the oil cooler replacement,
but that was not it.

Thankyou,
