Subject:      Re: phosphate-free antifreeze

Most of us use phosphate-free antifreeze religiously in hopes that it
staves off the dreaded head leaks.  Still, I've known vanagons that had t=
o
have head replacement at 50K with Volkswagen antifreeze and others that
used whatever was on sale and went over 100K, so there are no guarantees.=

Still, since Prestone now has a phosphate-free antifreeze at a reasonable=

price (comes in a silver container instead of the phosphate-containing
yellow container) why take chances?
