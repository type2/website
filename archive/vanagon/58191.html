Wait till you see the price of R-12 this year!  Stock up.  It is no longer 
manufactured.  Almost all of it sold now is recovered or imported old stock.  
If you must have AC and you plan to keep your buss awhile.  Might as well 
upgrade as part of your next AC repair.  Most of our vans are getting ready 
for new hoses and stuff anyway.  Save your $$ for the big day.

&gt;The price for R-134A was also the same as R12 last summer.  So
&gt;the only benefit is to the ozone layer.  IMHO not much of an 'upgrade'.

Some of us do not measure the health of the planet and the future of our
children in terms of dollars and cents.
