Subject: Front Glass

 Volks,

 I stand corrected as per the following:

 According to information received, the glass should be stamped Sigla (which
is the logo impressed on the broken pieces at the current time), it should
have been made from March 1955 through whatever month of 1967, the logo
should be able to be read from the outside with the imprints close to the
center post. Standing in front of the vehicle, the left glass has the logo
printed on the top, right side close to the center post. The right glass has
the logo printed on the top left side close to the post. The one thing I
noticed is the fact that the rest of the glass (all around) has the Sekurit
logo printed.

 Bottom line: would prefer the glass with the Sigla logo but will HIGHLY
consider glass with any logo and even two pieces  :-)

 Thanks!
