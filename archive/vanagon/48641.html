Mail from this list has been fun, informative, seductive, and generally
delivered with taste, and a surprising spirit of mutually supportive
community.  I'm over commited now.  So I want to say thanks for making me
feel welcome and wish you all well, especially for your continuing shared
love affair with VW vans of all descriptions.  I'll think of you often
and miss you greatly.    John Wakefield
