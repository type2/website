So William Abbott says:
&gt; 	Ok, I just Did It- I'm ordering a turn-key, smog-legal,
&gt; 1970 Bus motor with hydraulic valves, breakerless electronic
&gt; ignition (Compufire) and a dog-house oil cooler. Mark at ECI
&gt; is building it for me and it'll cost $1650, delivered to my
&gt; door, with a clutch kit. He'll give me $140 core charge for the
&gt; ES21 case, rods, crank, heads, rockers, etc.

Hmm.. Seems kind of steep to me.  What's the warranty on this
powerplant?  Be sure to get it in writing. 

Regarding not being ready for Pfeiffer, I'd say you're better off
breaking the engine in with short drives at first and working up
to longer ones.  

&gt; 	I know this sorta goes against the DIY ethos of this organization,
&gt; and it sure is a pile of money. I'm sure there's plenty left for me
&gt; to do, and life is short. I'd rather drive a bus than fix a bus.
&gt; 

Actually, with the vanagon, I kind of miss the tinkering with the
car routine.  But when something goes wrong with it, I have to
rely on this list which has really been great, but I just don't
have the confidence with it as I did with the older VWs.  

BTW, I'm sure plenty of things will pop up on your new baby that
will keep you on toes.  ;)

Cheers!
Steven
