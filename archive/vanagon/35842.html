&gt;They didn't mean which VW model, they meant which (catwalk) model that has
&gt;appeared in a VW advert. Everyone else in the pub understood correctly,
&gt;which I think just shows my minds to one track when it comes to VWs.
&gt;
&gt;(BTW how many cylinders did the Paula Hamilton have? Was it aircooled :))

What size jugs did the paula hamilton have?  :)
