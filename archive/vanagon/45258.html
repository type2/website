&gt; Yeah, but only if you can tell me of a better way to level my Vanagon


I tried to avoid continuing this thread... But couldn't help myself...

Level it by raising the sagging rear back up to it's proper height...
That would, however be &quot;fixing&quot; it and not a sano customization, so you 
may not want to go that route.
