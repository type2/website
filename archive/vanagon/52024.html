Subject: 38K!


        I was on my way from work home today at about 8pm and I noticed a
new Eurovan Camper on the VW lot in Medford OR.  I walked over to look, it
was the V6 with the new fromt end look, it looked ok (I still prefer the
vanagon's looks) kinda like a tall Ford Windstar.  But 38thousand US dollars!  

        FWIW, this lot had no gates, the keys were in the ignition, the
doors were unlocked and there was no one there.  I guess that the dealer
felt that it's styling was it's best defense.
