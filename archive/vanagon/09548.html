  How much further is it to Death Valley? I've been there in March and it was
  wonderful. I think we took two days to get there though - in which case that
  wouldn't work for a weekend. I was lobbying with the family to go there for 
  Easter week, but - as usual - I'm being out-gunned in favor of a trip to 
  the _at_*!%## in-laws.
