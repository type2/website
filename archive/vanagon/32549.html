Hi,

Just received from VofA, Vol.1, issue1, of Volkswagen World (Sept/95 issue).

Also received computer disk &quot;Free internet Access.  Automatic connection to the
Volkswagen Home Page&quot;.  Haven't installed it yet.  Says &quot;Spry Mosaic&quot;.

Another slip mentions the Volkswagen Internet Address which is as follows:
HTTP://WWW.VW.COM
Same slip refers to &quot;Compuserve (Spry) Technical Support hotline.

The Volkswagen World issue has a Volkswagen information center phone number
which is 800-DRIVE-VW

Don't know how I got on their list.  Phoned them several months ago asking for
their gift catalog.  They said they were in the process or reprinting but still
have not received it.

Has anyone installed the disk?  Is this just another Compuserve promotion?


On again, off again in my 1990 Vanagon.
Scamper from Vancouver's damper in my Westfalia camper!
