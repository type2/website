&gt;Oops...  Sorry for the mistake.  I thought that you were talking about the 914.
&gt;
&gt;I know that they came in both 4 and 6 cylinder variants.  Does anybody know if 
&gt;the 914 6 cylinder was that same as the 911 6 cylinder engine?

The 6 cylinder 914 was actually 1 916, or sometimes called a 914-6.  They
used the 2.2L motor, although a lot of the conversions have 2.4's and 2.7's.

Killer autocross car - you get the power of the 911 with the balance and 
low center of gravity of the 914.
