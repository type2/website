Subject: Re: Drivin' in Mean Wind

I used to get a tow behind a Greyhound or a tractor trailer when I drove a 
56 bug, but I was never comfortable about it, since you have absolutely no
idea what kind of insignia will be on the doors of the next car the wind-
breaker vehicle passes.  Might be better with a CB, so you could ask permis-
sion and get live updates from the front.

The effect is really dramatic once you really tuck in there.  No buffeting,
and you can lift off the accelerator by a half-inch.

I still remember the look on the face of the driver of a shiny new Jaguar, as
he was passed by a Trailways bus followed extremely closely by a little tan
bug.

Interestingly, you can get most of the effect with the tractor trailer behind
you, too, but the driver has to be a real a**hole to get close enough so his
bow wave merges with the turbulence coming off your car.
