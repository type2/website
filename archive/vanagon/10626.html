&gt; I've never had the van on a scale to get the real weight - has anyone
&gt; done that?  What does a truck stop scale usually charge for some dork who
&gt; wants to weigh his or her private vehicle?
Over thanksgiving, I weighed mine outside of Calgary (this was oil sprays all
over my rear, part II).  They have a self-weigh scale there.  With my camper
loaded with roughly 100 lbs of food, and + me (under 200) and my wife (under
150) .... oops (under 120) it came in at 2010 kg, I seem to remember.  You
may do the conversion if you trust my memory.
