&gt; I want my mommie!  (Or at least a nice story from Unca Joel!)  :)
&gt; After twice getting my bus back from the garage that sold it to me
&gt; with less-than satisfactory tuning, I took it to another shop
&gt; and was told that the reason it won't stay in tune and gets 13 mpg (!)
&gt; is that the carbs (Now I really hate the fact that it's a dual carb!)
&gt; need to be rebuilt, at a cost of $1000.  Is there an alternative?
&gt; Or have I spent $3000 dollars on a 20-year old vehicle just to spend
&gt; another $1000 three months later?

I just rebuilt mine for $35.  Yes, rebuild kits are available for the
dual solexes here for about $17 each.  It took only a few hours to do
and they work great now!  DON'T PAY THE $1,OOO!  (I didn't really think
you would, but just in case).  Hey, I'll drive up there and rebuild them
for you for *half* that!  Maybe even 1/3 that!  :)
