Hey:

Well someone broke in the Vanagon and took the passanger side vent
(triangle) window out to do it. VW no longer sells the &quot;kit&quot; just the
glass. I still have all the parts, clasp, etc. but they want $54 for
the glass and another $70 to install. So... my question is, the
assembly seems straight forward.
However, the clasp used to secure the window, I can't seem to find
out how to remove the backing so that I can reinsert it through the
new window hole. Any suggestions? Also, there seems to be some glue
on the window at the pivot points?

Thanks.

PS The San FRancisco library got caught with its pants down (canI say
that any more, or am I haeded for jail and a fine?) dumping books as
they move to a new library, I hope one of the books  wasn't Bentley!
