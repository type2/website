Some of you may have read my first posting about starting in sub-zero temps.

Well, with all of my efforts I was unable to start my Syncro.  This weekend 
I want to go through everything that effects starting (replace:  plugs, 
wires, rotor, cap . . .)  Is there anything else that may have an impact? 
 Should I change the injectors?  Cost?

I received a few replies to my first posting - hats off to all - Joel Walker 
offered good advice, I don't think it was copied to the entire list (his 
comments follow).

&gt;&gt;&gt;remember that the Digifant fuel injection is very sensitive to battery
&gt;&gt;&gt;voltage. :( if the battery can't put out at least 9v (i think that's 
right),
&gt;&gt;&gt;the FI computer will not work at all and you'll never get it cranked, no
&gt;&gt;&gt;matter if the battery has enough amps to turn the starter. :(

&gt;&gt;&gt;if they can't get you one way, they'll get you another. :(
