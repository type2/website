Subject: More carb troubles

Well, Vroomhilda is giving me more trouble. Situation runs like this:

When I start it first thing on a cold morning, it runs great. Idles smooth,
	pulls away smooth.

Runs OK for about 5 minutes. After that, it runs OK at speed, but when
	I step off the gas, it dies immediately. Just like I turn the
	key off.

After another 10 minutes, it starts running OK again. Idles, etc. This
	is usually right when I get to work. 

I thought initially that it may be the choke, but it seems to be operating
	OK. Mabye (being mexican) it is built for warmer climes, and
	unloads too quickly? If I turn it richer, it is impossible to
	drive until it warms up for five minutes or so. Too long.

Is there any way to make the choke unload more slowly? I have thought of
putting a resistor in line with it, and adjusting it to change the voltage
across the heater coil. Measure the heater current, then decrease it ten
or fifteen percent?

Could it be something else? Mabye I just need to clean out those carb heater
pipes? 

Thanx.
