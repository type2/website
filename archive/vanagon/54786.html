Subject: Screeming front heater fan?

My front heater fan seems to scream alot when I try to use it. When the fan
does push out air it gives off a screaming sound and the air flow seems to
go up and down no mateer what position the fan is on. I tryed to take the
front plate of the heating assembly just under the dash but can't figure
out how to take the darn thing off. I looked for bolts or clamps bu can't
find a thing. Please tell how I can remove this front Plate. I hope the
heater fan is not to camplicated?
