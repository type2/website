Subject: Re: VWoA warranty - any recent experience?

In a message dated 95-10-11 19:28:59 EDT, you write:

&gt;&gt;Anybody been through something like this?  Is there a &quot;percentage they'll
&gt;&gt;pay formula&quot; anyone knows the details of?  They're being very vague.
&gt;&gt;

I blew a head gasket on my '88 Vanagon about two years ago...WELL out of
warranty.  My dealer contacted VWoA, who picked up 50% of the repair bill.
 All I had to do was mention to the dealer that I had already returned the
Vanagon (under warranty) for a recall to retorque the head bolts, and he took
care of the rest.   BTW, I had 60,000+ miles on it at the time, so I felt
rather fortunate that VWoA did anything at all.  Give it a try!
