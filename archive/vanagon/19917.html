Subject: 71 Westy - Alameda, CA -  $1,000

I've been eyeing a '71 Westy in Alameda, Calif for more than a month now, but
have decided to take a pass and let someone else have a shot at it.  It is
your basic poptop, appears to have all canvas (incl tent), and NEEDS A MOTOR.
 The body is fine, no rust, and the red paint would probably rub out pretty
well.  Asking price $1,000; I think they would take half or two-thirds of
that just to be rid of it.

Story (by owner's father) is that &quot;it started smoking&quot; on the freeway, so
owner pulled over, and had it towed to Dad's home nearby (where I have seen
it sit for several weeks).  I crawled all over it, but not under it.  Popped
the top, checked the canvas, screens, and zippers -- real good.  Looks good
inside, jalousies good -- not new, but good.  Odom says 60-something (160?
 260?).  Dad started it briefly, but it sounded so bad that I said to kill it
(so it would still have core value).  Didn't check steering, tranny,
front-end, or nothin' like that.  A real crap shoot.

It's parked in front of 1417-5th Street, Alameda CA. 
 (From I-880, go thru Posey Tube.  
Continue on Wester Street till it T's with Central Ave.  
Right on Central for a few blocks.
Right on 5th Street for 1/2 block.  
Red Westy is at the curb on the left with &quot;for sale&quot; sign on windshield.  You
can't miss it.)  
Sign says call (510)769-1089, which isn't an Alameda number, so probably
daughter's phone.

I almost bought it for an immediate rebuilt engine swap, but I've got no
place to do the work.  Plus, for the money, I think I'm going to get a
Detroit van of same vintage and camperize it as the summer passes.  (Flame
on, but remember what a sweet guy I was to tell you about this.)

Rotsa ruck.  

Usual disclaimers.
