Subject: Ark. VW Show Report

Hi all,

I just returned from my 'spectator' visit of the Eureka Springs, Arkansas 
VW show.  I'm still in sensory overload although I was only there a few 
hours.  There was over 100 entries in my estimate and somebody from VW 
Trends was there, if it matters any. Show Highlights:

51 Canadian Standard unrestored split window Bug (driven to Show I think)
52 Black Bug owned by Bernie in Oklahoma
55 Bug with many vintage 50's guages (from Oklahoma)
56 Bug with foxcraft skirts and many, many accesories (from Iowa)
Several very nice T-II's, but not too many old-old ones
An interested Grateful Dead-theme Bubble Window Bus 
3 Type III Ghias, all very nice restorations, one in primer, but still nice
About 10 very nice 60's and newer TI Ghias

Swap meet highlights:

2 toolkits, one empty ($300 something), one full ($675)
One set Okrasa 40hp heads
Oval Cabriolet Deck lid (one hinge busted, but gd shape) $375

My scores:  50's Ghia taillight, 58-64 TII rear bumper, NOS 36hp cam etc, 
36hp mechanical distributors, and a brass VW belt buckle!!  Oh Boy! 8-)

Junkyard Highlights:  A troop of us from the Kansas City Area visited the 
'Way Out' VW Salvage yard way-out in the Ozark Mountains.  About a 1/2 a 
dozen VW Trucks, a few Things, a TIV, 9 Ghias, 7-8 Vanagons, about a 
dozen Bubble window vans, and 2 Ovals. Over 200 VW's in a very isolated 
area!  Worth seeing if you're ever in NW Arkansas!
