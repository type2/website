&gt;Those of you planning on the tour, might want to be thinking ahead about these 
&gt;items, which I'll also include in my upcoming list of things to bring, but 
&gt;these bear some thought ahead of time:
&gt;
&gt;autoclub card
&gt;maps and guidebooks
&gt;health insurance card
&gt;car insurance verification
It is illegal to travel without insurance in Canada.

&gt;birth certificate or passport may be required to cross border
If you are an American citizen, you may not need a passport, but a birth
certificate is the only acceptable alternative if the customs officials get
picky.  The same thing applies to Canadians wanting to come home.  Of
course, if you pick the right crossing, you probably won't even have to show
I.D.

&gt;list of authorized VW dealers
And unauthorized alternatives which are often cheaper and better.  I'd like
to have such a list whether I travel on this trip or not.  Particularly for
the Pacific Northwest.  

&gt;learn CPR?
&gt;remember that it is illegal to carry firearms across country boundaries
They will be confiscated.  If you try to hide them, and they are found, your
vehicle and it's contents will be confiscated.  I remember a story about a
guy who hid his guns, but not the ammo.  Canadian customs didn't believe
that the .44 ammo would fit the .22, and took his truck apart until they
found the Magnum.  I don't think the guy got to keep his truck...  This
apparently happens all the time, so customs officials are good at finding
guns.  Besides, we're nice people.  The only vehicles that get shot at are
truckers on the 401 in Ontario.
