&gt;Subject: Major Weekend Score! =)

As advertised in last weeks' Phoenix area &quot;free ad&quot; publication, e.g. Auto
Trader Misc for sale or &quot;Recycler&quot; style publication:

*VW Tint, can also be used as a tint without the bus, $50. call
(602)XXX-XXXX, PEORIA.*

A VW buddy of mine saw the ad and was told that he had been the only person
calling in a week. The ad stated that a &quot;Tint&quot; was for sale. Arizona is
thick with auto window tinting places and tend to be ignored due to their
commonality. My friend determined that the seller was moving and leaving
Phoenix by 11:00 Saturday. The &quot;tint&quot; needed to be picked up prior to that
time. (No problem)! What they had was an NOS stand alone/drive away circus
tent (68&gt;) and settled on $35.00!!!!!!! =) =) =). The seller stated, in
their Missourri accent (tint vs tent), that they just didn't have room on
the truck for stuff that didn't have that much value and that they'd never
have a use for. OK! Leave that worthless junk behind! The VW buddy was stuck
at work and asked if I'd do the leg work. Sure. Asked the friend if I could
have first dibs on it if he were to ever sell it. He has no westy/doesn't
camp. Cool. I picked it up and it was perfect, complete, and in a big old
red and white striped bag similar to a equipment bag for a baseball team. It
looked like it was used maybe once due to the slight mud on the underside of
the floor. The friend determined that he wanted to keep it, Cool, glad to
help a friend. End of story.

The following day the &quot;VW buddy&quot; called me stating that he determined (at
the first of the month) that he really needed money after all. Rusty asked
if he was very sure and then flew over to his spot and swooped it for a
&quot;little more&quot; than what he paid, made it worth his time, but still got a
killer deal compared to today's typical market prices. 
Sorry to sound like &quot;look at me&quot; but I am excited about the deal and this
reaffirms in my mind that &quot;they&quot; are still out there and surface in the
weirdest places. Substitute anything you want for the term &quot;they&quot;. 

Going camping this weekend! harf, harf, harf! =)
