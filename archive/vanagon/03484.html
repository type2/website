Subject: RE: vanagon rear wheel brg. ????

&gt;
&gt;The Bentley book (mine is 1986 edition) doesn't clearly indicate that there is
&gt;a large C clip that needs removed before pressing out the inner bearing.
&gt;
  I looked in the same, bearing &quot;adjustment&quot; is obtained by correctly 
torquing down the 46MM nut. A spacer sleeve is located over the spindle 
between the two inner bearing races. Your 'adjustment' is due to the length 
of this tube when under the massive compression from torquing the nut down. 
So get it right, over tight will hurt the bearings! As the bearings wear I 
can see this adjustment opening up, so retorque it and try again. Anyone 
asked the dealer if the spacer sleeve should be replaced with the bearings? 
It may take a set over the years.
