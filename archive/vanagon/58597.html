OK folks, I read the response from Bryan Ellis to my last message, sent to
Chris.  Ellis's initial message opened with an old post of mine from the
archives which detailed EXACTLY how to install a 2 seater bench in the
middle of a Westy that doesn't have any floor tracks.  Which is exactly what
Ellis's request was for.  It described in simple terms how to pull up the
carpet, floor, and what to look for and what to do. And there really was no
need for Chris to apologize just now because Ellis's tracks aren't already
in place.

Before I forget... I tried to mail Ellis directly, but the mail bounced,
sorry folks.  I see the list becoming a far different place than it was even
a year ago.  There didn't used to be any dimwitted asses like Ellis who
expect to be hand fed the answers because they can't figure it out given a map.

Ellis is obviously too stupid or too lazy to even work out how to lift the
carpet.  If I wanted to bolt down a seat to safely carry two people using
seatbelts etc. I think I would have tried a little harder to get a look at
the real steel floor, especially after having my hands on a posting that
details step by step what to do.  For pointing out this both Chris and I get
called assholes, and I get a supercilious Karma spiel from someone who
obviously doesn't give a rats ass about good Karma, as evidenced by his
off-list reply to Chris.  Ellis, you're a pathetic pile of dog crap, sell
the bus, give some credibility back to bus owners.

It's getting near time for me to bail from this list. Bye for now, Tim
