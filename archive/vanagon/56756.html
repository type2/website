Subject: FW: Milwaukee Auto Show--VWoA has no plans for Eurovan
Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 22:04:13 -0700

Just to add a slightly different answer, at the Chicago show, the rep
told me VW would bring in the V6 Euro as a 98 model.  I guess I didn't
really believe him, but there you have it.

&gt;
&gt;Just a quick report on VW from the Milwaukee Auto show which just ended on
&gt;Sunday.  I asked Hans the VW rep at the auto show when we could expect to
&gt;see the 97 Eurovans and he said that VWoA has no plans to bring the Eurovan
&gt;to the US.  He said VWoA looked into it but the pricing just didn't
&gt;fit--like 30 to 35k for the CL to MV models.  He said they are able to sell
&gt;the 97 Eurobago for less than one of the Eurovan models.  He said at that
&gt;price and because of all the minivan competition they just didnt think they
&gt;would sell.  I defintely felt like this was a subject he didnt want to talk
&gt;about.  He did say that he got many inquiries from people at the show as to
&gt;Eurovan availablity.
&gt;
&gt;No plans for Eurovans in the US--say it isn't so!  :(
