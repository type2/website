&gt; Hi Syncro Heads---
&gt;      You guys are probably tired of answering lame questions, but here goes
&gt; anyway: 
&gt;      
&gt;      I've heard of people driving their cars with the front driveshaft
&gt; disconnected.  Is there any reason that this is a good/bad idea?

       I have had my drive shaft out all summer. I'm sure it saves some fuel.
       How much maybe very small. The reason I took mine out was to find 
       a vibration, and do other much needed repairs,(including the clutch
       disc). Removal of the shaft also make turning sharp curve (like in
       a parking lot) easier.
&gt; 
&gt;      Was the differential lock available on any 2wd cars?  

                             NO

        But I built one.
        Want to buy it?
&gt; 
&gt;      I've heard that &quot;with a few minor mods&quot; these cars can be more rugged
&gt; and reliable.  What kinda mods are we talking about?
&gt; 
&gt;      I got more, but I'll spare you.  Many thanks!
