&gt; I posted a little one liner yesterday about the '72 bus 4-sale.
&gt; ***It was sold over the weekend to a relative of a list member.***
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to replace all of my vacuum lines and and as many fuel
&gt; lines as I can over the weekend.  Just a little Preventive Maint.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the wasted bandwidth folks. Have a nice weekend,
&gt; Jack  '73 Westy

Be extremely careful of the stretch of fuel line from the tank to the fuel pump.
The tank has a sump so if you pull the line off it will continue to gush down
on your face out of the gas tank nipple.  The nipple is 5 mm as well which is not a common
fuel line size (Nothing else will do).  I drained the tank via siphon first and then had a large catch
under the van with me to catch the last 1/2 liter or so.  I then replaced the line
since it was 20 years old and put in a ball type shut off valve between the tank
and the fuel pump.  This allows me to shut the flow off completely if I pull the engine
(3 times now- I'm learning) and if I want to drain the tank to play with the 
lines prior to the valve I can put on a long line after the valve and allow it to drain away using the valve to control the flow.
Also I can use the valve to make sure that the engine won't start for someone
unfamiliar with my van.  Unfamiliarity breeds confusion.

What ever you do do not set yourself on fire under the van since the transaxle
has a magnessium case that will light up a city block if it goes.  That would also ruin your day
and the van.
