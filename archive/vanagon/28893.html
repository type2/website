Subject: Re: gasoline politics


&gt;&gt;       Oh, and speaking of political gasoline buying, my current
&gt;&gt;vendor (Shell) is one of the largest producers in Nigeria... which
&gt;&gt;just hanged a group of environment/human-rights activists... so
&gt;&gt;I may have to take my $100/month gasoline habit somewhere else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And my life just gets that much more complicated and expensive.  I knew
&gt;this, and I remeber hearing it on NPR.  I guess I'll have to give up the
&gt;84.9 that I'm paying for regular at the Shell station in my 'hood' here in
&gt;Atlanta.  It's the Quaker conscience haunting me again.


Don't forget BP despoiling the North Sea. They're out, too.
And Starkist catches an occasional dolphin-- they're history!
Owens Corning Fiberglas still pollutes more than anyone in the Santa
Clara Valley-- no more pink stuff!
Do you realize that jet engines have NO pollution control equipment? Zero,
zip, nada. Boycott all airlines.

I could go on forever... but I'd be kicked off the list. For good reason.
