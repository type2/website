&gt;well, i got another sucker-letter in the mail today from Franklin Mint,
&gt;wanting me to buy their Classic Microbus, for ONLY 5 equal payments of
&gt;$27* each (*Plus my state sales tax and a one-time shipping charge of
&gt;$4.95),
&gt;with the first payment due prior to shipment.  &quot;all orders subject to
&gt;acceptance&quot;. HA!

&gt;anyhoo, was anybody stupi ... er, Dedicated (yeah, that's it!) enough to
&gt;buy this thing? :)  i'm kinda curious as to the quality/etc.

&gt;not that i would buy it, mind you. not at that price, anyway. just curious.

I saw one of these at the last swap meet I went to. It really is a nice model.
The detail and quality is excellent,all doors open, and it's stock, no custom
extras, but is it worth $135? Who knows. I'd probably be stupid ... er,
dedicated enough to buy one if I was rich enough, but there are too many toys
I'd rather buy for my van for that much money. I just have to settle for my
little Schabak Vanagon model that sits on my monitor, and is even the same
color as my '87. Now I need a blue one to match my '85.
