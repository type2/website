&gt; If they think that the Jetta Trek thing is a good concept, why not a Westy
&gt; Trek?  Or better yet a Synchro Westy Trek!    
Good point - I was at the dealer a while back around the time we were 
shopping for mtn bikes - the Jetta Trek came in at $17900 CDN, which 
seemed like a great deal, since many of the other Jettas loaded up 
were well over $20K (the VR6 is about $30k). I would never buy a new 
car again, but I was surprised at the good value in this package, 
comparitively anyway.

A Westy Trek is a natural - around here a bus *without* a bike rack is 
a rare sight...
The Trek idea is a step in the right direction, but could be easily 
copied by H*nda or anyone else. Now let's see someone copy a Westy 
Syncro Trek... 

&lt;dream mode=off&gt;
