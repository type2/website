I believe so--23x is a Kombi.  Nothing overly special about the Kombi to 
warrant a higher price than any other particular model.  But check out 
this van's interior well!  Some of the after-market kits weren't of such 
good quality, as I am finding out ('70 Kombi w/ bad aftermarket kit).  

But $2500.  Hmmmm.  I'd do it, if:  
a)  It's rust-free, esp. the batt. tray.
b)  The front end is solid
c)  The rear end is same (shifts OK?  How about from 2nd gear to 3rd on 
hard acceleration:  does it go into 3rd with a &quot;grinding syncro&quot; 
feeling--seems to me the 3rd gear (not &quot;grinding&quot; but perhaps a little 
shudder) goes bad first.  

Keep us posted!
