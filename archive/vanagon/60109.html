Subject: Re: sink pump


Michael,
I believe there are 2 fuses behind the drivers seat, 1 of which is for 
the sink pump.  Look for a small black box w/red wires coming out of it.  
I don't remember the amp#, but I have a faint memory of this being a 
problem w/my van when I very first got it and was ironing out a few 
bugs.  Good luck.

&gt;         Do I have to prime it or anything? Could it be the wiring and not
&gt; the pump itself?
&gt;         Theres lots of H20 in the tank, about 1/2 full.
