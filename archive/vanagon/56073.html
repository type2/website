&gt; Hi again.  I'm still trying to put my '81 into factory condition.  I have
&gt; some stuff coming from the Parts Place.  Are they usually reliable?

	I have never dealt with Parts Place personally but I have heard of
many horrific stories about them.  One individual is still out
something like $250 for something that he purchased but never
recieved.  Parts Place will not refund his money, and the credit card 
company won't stop a charge that is over 300 mi away.  There was a whole
long thread about all the problems people have had with them in
rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled. I would watch them closely, and pester
them *when* there's a delay, *when* they send you the wrong part, and
*when* they overcharge you.  Perhaps there are millions of satisfied
customers out there that have no reason to post their wonderfull
experiences to a newsgroup, but PP would still be last on my list...
