Subject: Head Woes on 84 GL/Vanagon Retrospect

Hi All,

I have been busy swapping around 1.9 Wasser motors lately.  My 1.9 that
was in my 84 GL Brownie Bus was very reliable.  I had learned how to nurse
slow head leaks and exhaust leaks while logging more than 8,000 miles on
her since last May, often towing Bugs and heavy loads.  A few weeks ago I
swapped out the original motor (138k) for an 85 Westy motor that needed a
new home.  It was yanked to install a Chevy V-6 and Bob Hufford helped me
locate the 85/95k motor with all the accessories.  The 85 motor runs very
strong, but I am presently having troubles getting the coolant bled
properly.

Anyway, today I began disassembling the 138k ex-Brownie Bus motor.  I
pulled the heads a few hours ago and upon inspection, they look to be the
originals with the typical telltale signs of leakage.  The Bars Stopleak
worked as much as it could, but it is not a pretty sight.  More
importantly, each head has a matching crack between the valves, quite
similar to many air-cooled heads I have seen.  The motor still ran well,
despite the cracks.  I have a few other 1.9's in the garage.  One is a
Canadian rebuild with a bad crank and great heads, so after a cleanup and
replacement of a broken exhaust bolt, they should get the old motor back
on the road after I install it in my red 85 standard.  Both Brownie and Red
are tentatively sold to good volks folks once I have them on the road

I would not have been able to tackle these projects if it weren't for the
vast resource of information we call the Vanagon List!  I have a long
background in air-cooled VWs and in the past have felt it futile to
venture into the water-cooled realm hobby-wise.  Although sometimes
discouraging, it is an interesting road to travel, this water-cooled
Vanagon road.  Now if I can find the road designated for the Syncro
Vanagons!  Soon, I hope, soon!  8-)  8-)  8-)
