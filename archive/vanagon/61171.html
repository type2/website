Subject: Repair, replace, or burn the thing!

&gt;
If you knew someone (I won't say who.) who owned an 85 camper (with 135K =
on
it) that was blowing exhaust into the coolant, would you advise him/her t=
o-
A)Replace the heads(again) and wonder how long the fix will last!
B)Install a rebuilt engine and wonder how long before the new engine leak=
s
exhaust too!
C)Burn the thing!

In other words, how can I achieve a fuzzy, warm feeling that I can get
where I'm  going in the old bucket of bolts without the aid of a tow truc=
k?
&gt;

I am in the same boat with my 85 Westy with 150K.  I chose to look high a=
nd
low for a trustworthy mechanic with a long history of working on VW's and=
 a
good attitude.  After five months I found one.  He is going to spend an
hour with my Van next week and then decide how to proceed.  I am prepared=

to:  1.  replace the gaskets if heads aren't pitted too much, 2.  replace=

the head(s) if they are, and  3.  replace the engine if 1 &amp; 2 won't give =
us
a &quot;warm fuzzy&quot;.  All on his recommendation.
