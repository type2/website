&gt; 
&gt; another weirder answer to the missing brake fluid could be that the BRAKE
&gt; master is leaking into the booster, hence the dissapearing fluid.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone???

  Could be, I lost a reservoir full to the brake booster over a period of a 
  couple months. But this has to be a no-brainer: this vehicle is in *storage*,
  no-one is pushing on the brake or clutch, forcing the fluid out some tiny 
  score or crack. This stuff dripping with only the force of gravity behind it.
  My guess is the connection between the reservoir and the clutch master 
  cylinder or one of the fittings very close to that. If the fluid isn't   
  dripping all the way to the floor, it may be dripping on to something in the
  dash. If that material is plastic, it could be absorbing the fluid, which
  is a pretty good solvent among other things. You should see what it can do
  to the paint on an MG. I'd suggest placing a paper towel immediately under-  
  neath the clutch master and see if any drips show up. Does anyone know if
  brake fluid evaporates if left out in the air for a while?
