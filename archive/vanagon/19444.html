&gt; &gt; Yup.  It's called the Rialta, and it's a pig.  Stock engine, horrible
&gt; &gt; ground clearance, unacceptably little interior space.  But, it's
&gt; &gt; relatively cheap (not much more than the Westy) and has a really trick
&gt; &gt; slide-out bathroom thingie.  Stop by your local RV dealer for a peek, I
&gt; &gt; did.  :)

&gt;  Someone who drives a '73 bus thinks something ELSE is underpowered?  has 
&gt; little interior space?  I checked one out.  I'm probably gonna buy one in 
&gt; a year or so.  Okay so I might wait until the V6 engine is in it.  BUT 
&gt; according to a guy who works at a VW dealer in Penn.  the Rialta IS NOT 
&gt; stock VW.  THe VW dealers can't work on them because Winnebago fiddles 
&gt; with them a bunch.  They even supposedly have a turbo version.  

Hmmm... the dealer where I saw the Rialta claimed that it had a stock
motor, with 108 (I think) horsepower. 
&gt; 								 as happy
&gt; as I am with the Eurovan and it PLENTY powerful engine I'm not too 
&gt; worried about the power.  The EV power is pretty good at the low end but 
&gt; for a vehicle its size it is almost AMAZING at the high end - its the 
&gt; transmission not the engine that could lead one to think there is a lack 
&gt; of power.

 I didn't mean to imply that the Eurovan is underpowered, certainly not
 compared to my bus - driving 2,000 miles behind Pete Sellers in his
 Eurovan proved that to me (but when I get the 2.0 installed, then we'll
 see!).  My gripes are specifically with the Rialta.  With all the extra
 weight and (what I was led to believe was) the stock engine, I doubt I
 would be very far behind it up grades.  The sewer drain pipe thing on
 the side was a mere 5 inches off the ground - liable to hit it on speed
 bumps!  The advertise it as having over 6 feet of headroom inside, but
 that is only in the entrance way - a small area about 3 feet square.
 The rest of the camper has about 5'9&quot; headroom, and I can't even come
 close to standing upright in it.
 
&gt; Drove many years in a '72 bus - pretty close in 'power' to a '73 I'd imagine.
&gt; Did they put a 1800 in the '73? not much more than a 1700...

No, 73 still had a 1700 but I went up to 1800 when I rebuilt it, cause
the cylinder kits were the same price.

Again, I wasn't trying to slam the Eurovan - just giving my impression
of the Rialta conversion.  Sorry if I offended anyone.
