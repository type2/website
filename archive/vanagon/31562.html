Subject: Why do we all love our &quot;bricks&quot; so much? 

I purchased my 84 van from the origanal owner.  He took great care in his
vehical, as do I.  This van has 164k miles on it.  Between the 2 of us
(mostly him).  We have over $17,000 in receipts since it was purchased.  If
it was any other vehical it would be a huge LEMON!.  But instead, everyone
always says &quot;It's a Vanagon.&quot;.  The heads have been replaced twice, 12/92
and 12/94.  Here I am in 12/95 and I have to spend another $2,000 on
rebuilding the whole engine, including new heads again.  
Yes, I love my Van but... Don't it tick you off to think that for over 10
years in just the &quot;water boxer&quot; alone, VW has been snowing the public with
an inferior product.  I'm trying to replace my rear heater core for the 3rd
time in this van.  I called a whole bunch of junk yards to find a used one.
Every single one of the 19 that was located, leeked.  Ya think there's a bit
of a poor quality issue here? Of all the people on this group alone.  I
would say %99 of everyone with a watercooled van has had head problems or is
anticipating one.  Unless you change your break pads before there's metel on
metel you'll have to get new roters because there so thin they can't be
resurfaced safley.  How about the ever-so-popular leaking windshield.  Well
at least after my rebuild maybe my cooling system will be bled right.
Thank goodness for AAA.
As Meatloaf said in, Bat out of Hell II.  &quot;Life is a lemon and I want my
money back.&quot;
I feel better now.

&quot;Looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon
