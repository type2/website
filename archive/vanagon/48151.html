Subject: Nearly Perfect '91 Westy FS Phoenix, AZ

I have been watch a local dealership struggle to sell a '91 Westy for at
*least* a couple of months now. It used to be sitting in the rear/middle of
the premium used lot. Yesterday I noticed that it had been moved to the
front of the secondary lot. A bell went off in my head. =) It was the same
bell that went off when I &quot;stole&quot; the '83 westy. I stopped.

'91 full westy, 4spd., Silver mist, grey interior, A/C, 44,840 miles on it,
4 new Michellin (sp) 205/70R14 95S M&amp;S tires with scads of armorall on them.
Stock wheels with correct plastic wheel covers. =( Both tables, perfect
interior, has the air vent port hole thing in the poptop. Small amount of
some glue or other substance 1&quot; around the port hole vent. Remains of duct
tape? Dunno. One 4&quot; scratch on the rear hatch otherwise perfect paint and
body. Zero rust goes without saying. Possibly tinted windows~ I didn't notice.

$19,900.00 (eep!) &lt;-Mondo bucks_at_!

Honk!, the bell disappeared, bigtime...

It's *way* outta my league but someone might want a &quot;new&quot; one.
Even if I hit the lottery I would offer $12k cash or walk.
