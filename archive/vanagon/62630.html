Subject: Propane Tank - Update

OK the price on the Manchester 8 X 30 is down to $198 but there is 
some more information, no one's gotten back to me on the dimensions 
of the late vanagon tank, but this thing may simply be a non VW tank 
Manchester builds.  At 8 X 30, it is nearly twice the volume of my '81 
tank and appantly it features some sort of fill level sight glass or 
gage as I was informed it would be an extra $25 for a side mounted 
instead of end mounted level gage.  Anyway I should be getting a FAX 
tomorrow with dimensions etc, to look at before I go through the 
trouble of having the other manufacturer quote us a price.  Although 
the Manchester has flaws, on a new tank they could be overcome by 
carefully seam sealing the ID tag then giving it all a good coat of 
auto grade enamel or urethane.  Anyone else interested, I've only had 
tentative interest from about 10 people, for a discount we need to 
get a few more in line as I'm sure all of the current responders will 
not buy.  We are talking something about twice the volume of the 
early Vanagon tank, 3 times the volume of the Bus tank, meeting all 
current NFPA and DOT standards for exterior installation.
