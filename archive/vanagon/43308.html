Many years ago I got my 59 bus with it's mighty 36hp &quot;rolling&quot; down the road
coming back from Tahoe, I was going faster than the speedometer would read!
That was too fast and I was afraid to put it back into gear. Cheap thrills.

&gt;Westfalia Record?
&gt;November 10, 1989, I established the official speed record for VW campers
&gt;at 87.533 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats.  My '69 campmobile has a
&gt;1776cc engine equipped with Web Cam, dual Dellorto 40s, header system and
&gt;Perlux ignition.

&gt;yeah, sure. but the accompanying picture looks like he shaved the pop-top
&gt;down to about half its normal height! and he has a non-standard aero-spare
&gt;on the nose of the bus (that ought to be worth at least 0.000003 Cd). :)
