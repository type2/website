Volks,

I'm headed for Vallejo on this coming Sunday for the VW Good Guys Gig.  I'll
be bringing the whacked bus full of spare parts for sale at a swap spot near
you.  The sale includes the whacked bus ('71 westy), a couple carb &amp; FI
(circa '70 type 3) sets, '71 body parts, likely the short block out of the
bus I just got, and other things I haven't thought of yet.  

Gee, maybe I can get my friend to loan me a home-brew keg.

See Ya,
Eug,
'71
