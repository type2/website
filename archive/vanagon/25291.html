Subject: re:Bus as primary residence...


Enough already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am taking way too much flack re
my shower fetish thing!  :)  It's gotten to the point that there's
at least a few pieces of e-mail (list or private) per day now.  

Just to set the record straight:  I am now TOTALLY self-contained in
my '81 westy.  I did buy that unit called Shower Anywhere (check the
archives), and a foldable (like a TV tray/table) porta-potti.  What
else in life could one want?

At any rate, I can now shower/camp ANYWHERE.  Never again will I
be complaining about the sites chosen for group bashes.  My only
remaining problem will be how to learn to put up with those of you
who refuse to bathe.  :)
