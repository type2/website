&gt;       ##    meet women of the former USSR through romance ads  

Dammit!  I wanna meet guys!  This is heterosexist trash.  What about equal
opportunity?  :) 

&gt;
&gt;     Months ago, Olga Kosmina placed my personal ad in several papers of
the former Soviet Union.  Since that time I have received over 40 responses
for the $50 I mailed Olga.  &lt;snip&gt;

What I wanna know is whether or not you met Olga in a Bus, and more to the
point, was it a camper?  :0

&gt;     I have found that by placing a single bill between two pieces of
newsprint inside an envelope, the Ukrainian post cannot see through and does
not bother to tamper.  &lt;snip&gt;

Boy! Imagine my relief!  I'd hate to think I was throwing my money away :P

&gt;     Although Olga has never seen a newsgroup nor heard of &quot;net-etiquette,&quot;
she believes that helping others exceeds the cost of angering those who feel
the net should not be used in this fashion. &lt;heart-rending snip&gt;

That Olga, what a gal... all heart, I'm tellin' ya.

&gt;     IHA (I humbly ask) that you not flame the postmaster of this site.

Well, OK.  But only because he knows where I live...  :)

Cheerful Monday all!  Be sure to send Olga *lots* of money.  

Mike &quot;Call me Vladimir&quot; Wright, who's in a strange mood and counsels you all
to just ignore me today...

68 Camper (Frau Blucher)
79 Bus (Otto)

PS: Otto's back on the road after oil-pump transplant surgery.  He's doing
fine and showing no signs of rejecting.
