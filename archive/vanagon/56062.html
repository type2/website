No peanut butter will work just fine. Just try a little bit while you're 
eating some gum and you will see how well it does work. Anything oil based 
will work. I used to keep a bottle of baby oil in my bus when I lived in 
Europe. It made great bug and tar remover and since you would always get tar 
on you at the beach you needed an easy way to clean up before (and sometimes 
after) you got inside your bus. And since I had a bed in the back ... well 
thats another story for another medium.
