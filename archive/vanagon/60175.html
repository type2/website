I just replaced one of the instrument bulbs.  Not too hard to do, just be
careful.  Pull the white tabs sideways far enough to clear the housing, and
push forward (to the fron of the van) white bulb housing comes off and you can
replace the bulb.  The only thing to be careful about is there is a black
metal glare shield just setting on the gauge housing.  If you drop it into the
gauge (like I did) you might not notice it for oh say 2 weeks.  It's not hard
to retrieve it, a long needle nose or a magnetic screw driver does the trick.

Sorry I don't know about your other problems.

&gt; Hello listees, 
&gt; Here is an &quot;anyone else out there had this&quot; question:
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed just the other day that my tach quits wotking and my eng. temp
&gt; gauge flashes when I turn on my lights. Using the dimmer dial for the
&gt; instr. lights I get half a tach reading and the temp gives another
&gt; result. Checked fuses, wires, connections, etc to a moderate extent, no
&gt; removal of anything but the dash cowling, and no results. The oddest
&gt; thing was when I removed the fuse for the instr. lights the tach worked
&gt; w/lights on and the temp gauge flashed to no end.
&gt; 
&gt; The film (plastic) holding the circuits for the panel seems to be OK,
&gt; just recently bought this rig and can recall it working fine previously.
&gt; 
&gt; I am also curious about the replacement of instrument light bulbs. They
&gt; are fixed in the white mount pretty securely.

&gt; Anyone out there have a similar situation? Solution? Area to target?
&gt; 
&gt; Money to the list account from a quiet member, too.
