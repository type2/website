Subject: Right fuel pump?

I ordered a fuel pump from bigwheel/rossi and what I got doesn't match 
exactly.  It's getting close to critical timewise, so I'm thinking of 
finding some way to getting it to work.
On one end it has a fitting that is clearly meant to have a hose clamped 
onto it.  On the other end is a threaded fitting which has a valve in it 
They call it a 
    &quot;Thread connector with plessure retaining valve&quot;
I wonder -- was that supposed to be pressure or pleasure?

Mine has two hose clamped ends.

Anyway, has anyone seen a pump like this?  The fitting has 4 holes 
before the threads, and I don't know what kind of fitting I shoud attach 
to the hose to make it work?  The docs say it fits BMW 3,0 SI, 3.3 Li, 
633 CSi and 733i 528i, Mercedes-Benz 250 CE; 280 CE.
