&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Vanagon mail listees!  Nice to have the system up again!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Came back to a crashed computer.  Week later that is up, but the list is down!  Then the list is up, but my mail server is down!  Then I was dropped from the list! Begining to think someone doesn't want me to post this.  The email is still hit and miss...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Set off for CA from Ft.Worth on 11 July, but only made it as far as El
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paso.  Not the Westy's fault tho...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you may recall, the Beast ('83.5 water cooled Westy) was running rich and defying all my efforts to discover the cause.  I knew the O2 sensor was bad, but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replacement didn't help.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, it was running OK as I left Ft. Worth.  Milage at lst fill up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was  17.5 mpg, not too bad considering there was a lot of city driving
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on that tank, and I was bucking a stiff head wind.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next tank was 18.1, would have been worse, but I found a truck to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next tank was only 17.7, but now I was in west Texas, and couldn't find
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a truck to follow.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; All in all, it should have done better.  Auto transmission, but still.
&gt; Consistent with it running rich.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The wind died down.  But suddenly I noticed I was having trouble holding
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 60 mph going up a slight hill.  Pulled over and found carbon in the tail
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pipe.  Well, you know the drill by now:  cut the O2 wire.  Problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solved.  Also, advanced the timing a bit.  Felt it wasn't advancing all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the way at high speed.  Made me wish I had an old manuel advance on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; column.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That got me to El Paso where I stumbled into some consulting work.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seems everyone wants to partake fully of the bull market, but is nervous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the coming (eventually) decline.  Wanted me to work out some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strategies, hedging, and estimate the effectiveness and cost.  Well,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that keep me busy for a couple of weeks, but it paid well, and I could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use the work.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Drove the Beast about 40 mi per day, averaged 18 mpg.  It started
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulling to the right.  Been down that road before.  Tire tread
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; separation, no doubt.  But the right front tire was almost new (I know,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that doesn't mean anything).  But it looked fine (doesn't mean anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; either, can have separation that doesn't show, but does cause rolling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resistance and heat).  By the time I left El Paso, there was a solid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vibration.  Checked the left front and there it was.  Puzzled me as to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why a bad left tire would cause it to pull to the right!?  Didn't look
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; serious yet, so kept on driving.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lost all the propane.  I had replace the regulator last summer, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noticed a small leak at the connection I couldn't get out.  Must have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developed into a big leak.  Anyone know a handy fix?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; El Paso is not a bad place to go to excape the summer heat. (How's that,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say?)  Sure, it goes up to 100 F every day, but it is dry, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; altitude is over 3700 ft.  Makes a big difference.  Can handle it easy.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, it cools off rapidly as soon as the sun goes down, no ac needed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As opposed to Ft. Worth, where you hurry from AC to AC, and leave it on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all night.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Drove up to the mountain town of Riodosa, NM, summer playground of rich
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Texans.  A bit of a challenge for the underpowered brick.  Just open it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up, leave it there, and hope for the best.  A little disconcerting to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed by semis...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Was not looking forward to the return drive to Ft.Worth, but it had been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about a month since I left...  The return is on 2 lane country roads
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until the last leg into Ft. Worth.  At first got 18+ mpg, but dropped to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 16.1 as a nasty headwind developed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the tire was getting really bad, and I was hanging on to the wheel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to keep it straight, wondering if a hard left turn was still possible.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I got to the freeway I decided enought was enough, and put the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spare on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Front came thu, mpg went over 18 for the last leg.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Overall, not a bad trip for the Beast.  At 140k miles, it's a hobbly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeping everything going.  Sometimes I think I would sell it if offered
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the right price.  But I'd probably be looking for another a year later.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This one has no rust, no leaks, burnt l qt oil in 2000 mi, AC blows
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold.  I guy could do worse.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Got a new tire for $15 with allowance, dropped it off at the mechanics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to find out why it is running rich.  He adjusts the air mass meter with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an allen wrench (WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS TELL ME ABOUT THAT?).  After I had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the thing off and was trying to open it up!  Then he adjusts the timing,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; says distributer is not advancing all the way.  I figured that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Charged me $115!  Wanted to charge $215 but I screamed.  Said he had 4.5
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hrs in it.  I couldn't figure out how.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it's running good now, altho a new distributor is probably in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works...
