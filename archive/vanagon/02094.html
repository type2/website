Subject: Re: More trip talk

Count me in, but making a commitment would be tough.  I also notice that 
so far there hasn't been much interest from the MN,WI,SD,ND,IA,IL 
contingent, so the whole thing might not pass this way, and there's no 
way I'll be able to do parts that are over a 1000 miles away.  How about 
a route that passes through Vancouver and then south to Montana (of 
course, this misses the Saskatchewan person(s).)  From Montana across 
through SD, MN, WI Chicago Area, North back through Ottowa and then south 
through Maine,VT,NY etc and on down to VA.  You could swing west a ways 
to party with the PA bunch.  Of course, if there isn't much interest in 
this part of the Midwest, then you might as well skip us and just head 
across Canada.

Just some thoughts.
