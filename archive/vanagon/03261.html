&gt;Think of it this way, joel, those fold down armrests are actually giant,
&gt;mutant side bolsters that enable you to push the edge of the envelope
&gt;a la Hans Stuck, Derek Bell, et al.

yes, but MY bolsters stick out under THEIR bolsters. :)

&gt;dangerous (like cupholders...ever wonder why it took Euro
&gt;manufacturers so long to stick cupholders in their vehicles?).

from what i've 'heard' and from the reaction of a certain german who works
here, it's because they (germans) think that you shouldn't be DOING anything
while you are driving. and at 140 mph, they are probably right. :) but since
most americans CAN'T drive, they have to have something to occupy their
minds. ;)

&gt;I'm certain if all of us expected anything else from our Type IIs we'd be
&gt;sitting around reading posts from &quot;caravan_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;...
&gt;(juuuust kidding, Gerry!  :-)  )

you know, i've thought it was kinda odd ... and sad ... that there is NOT a
caravan/voyager list or even any clubs (that i've heard of). you would think
that as many people as drive those things, somebody would want to do that.
but maybe that's what brings vw people together: uniqueness. too many people
doing/wearing/saying the same thing tends to kill off a fad. i wonder if that
will happen to the american mini-van craze.
