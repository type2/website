Subject: RE: High Top Vanagon???

I could have been an Adventurewagen (sp?) camper. We saw one of
these, a '90 Syncro, as I recall, in Maryland last fall. It had a full
length, stand-up hightop.

Of course, hi-tops were available in the European market, and there
is always the homebrew possibility.
