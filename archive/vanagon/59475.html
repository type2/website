Subject: Re: syncro uneven tire wear? 

Steve,

Possible causes (can be combined):

1. Defective tire.
   - The steel belts located under the tire's tread may not be centered
     properly.  This would explain excessive shoulder wear.

2. Low tire inflation pressure.  This would explain excessive overall
   and shoulder wear.
   - If the bus has alloy rims, there may be a corrosion problem where
     the tire seats against the rim.  I have experienced this with Audi
     alloy rims.
   - Slow leak in the tire itself.
   - Neglect by owner.

3. Poor alignment.
   - The camber setting for the RF tire might be off, causing excessive
     outside shoulder wear.  This will not explain excessive overall wear.

4. Problem with front differential.
   - May not be distributing the torque properly to the front wheels. (I am
     not into the workings of Syncro differentials, so this is hypothetical)

5. Owner drives around in circles CCW.  Not probable.

&gt;The tire was put on at the same time and is just the same as all the rest.
&gt;The Current owner could not explain it.
&gt;All the tread was worn more than the other tires and it was also worn more the
&gt;outside(similar to hard cornering wear)
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks Michael for the reply
