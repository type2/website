Subject: Re: 2nd battery.._dot_deep cycle?

A deep cycle battery is essential for use as an auxilliary battery. A 
regular car battery won't last even one season. Make sure that even the 
deep cycle has at least double the amp hours you plan to take out before 
you recharge.

If your fridge draws 4 amps, and would be on 10 hours, then you'll be 
drawing 40 amp hours. That would need a battery of 80 am hour capacity or 
more.

Why so big? Even a deep cycle will die an early death if always drawn 
down to less than 50% charge. Lead acid batteries like to be recharged 
before they are dead, the sooner the better.

By the way, my experience with a Coolatron wasn't very good. Although it 
did eventually get to 40 degrees below ambient, that was rarely enough. 
Inside Vanagon temp: 90 degrees (often higher when parked); inside 
Koolatron: 50 degrees plus. Not cold enough for most foods.
