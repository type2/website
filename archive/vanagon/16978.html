Subject: conduit for your bus?

I was thinking about running a piece of flexible conduit under my bus to 
allow for the many wires I'll be running for the gauges.  Has anyone done 
this, or better yet how and where do you run the wires for the gauges?  I 
saw some stuff called &quot;ENC&quot;, which stands for electrically non conductive 
conduit.  It was $2.50 for 10 feet.  There are some connectors and such made 
for this stuff as well.  All in all, it would only cost around 6 bucks to 
run the length of the bus.  What do you think?

Chris.
