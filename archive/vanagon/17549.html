&gt;My Haynes book says the 50 HP 1600 achieves peak power at 4000 rpm, with
&gt;&quot;maximum cruising speed&quot; at 65 mph, which is 3900 rpm with the stock tires.
&gt;I can't remember where I saw 4400 rpm, 

The Bently has for the AE motor: 50 HP _at_ 4000 (DIN) and 60 HP _at_ 4400 (SAE).  
Who is DIN?

Also, I had thought that Muir said in the famous book that the shift points 
are 15-30-50.  It turns out that these all happen at 4400.  I dunno.
