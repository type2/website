Subject:       Re: Gears &amp; Big Tires


&gt; After studying my European microfiche, showing all parts for the Vanagon
&gt; available over there, I have determined that the following final drive gear
&gt; ratios are available for the transmission:
&gt; 
&gt; 37/6    6.17 (16&quot; vanagon?) 
&gt; 35/6    5.83 (diesel?)  
&gt; 38/7    5.43 (diesel?)      
&gt; 34/7    4.86 (DEFAULT USA)  This is what all you gasoline people have.  
&gt; 32/7    4.57 (?)    
&gt; 
&gt; If I am happy to drive the USA default 4.86 with 26 inch tall stock tires,
&gt; does anybody know how big a tire I can use with 5.43, 5.83, or 6.17 to keep
&gt; the same ratio onto the pavement? Or am I looking for 4.57? (I use a 27 inch
&gt; tall tire now [BF Goodrich 27x8.50 14&quot; All Terrain Radials] and this has
&gt; destroyed my acceleration and I want even bigger tires.)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, does anybody know what the largest size tire that will fit into a
&gt; Vanagon without rubbing up against the body? 
&gt; 
OK are you ready for this?  33 is the magic number that you can use 
with the 16' setup. BUT will they fit under the body?
Here are the formulas, from 1-87 Four Wheeler Mag. and Dick Cepek:

   MPH x GR                  RPM x D                NEW D x OLD GR
 ------------ x 336 = RPM  -----------: 336 = GR   ---------------=NGR
       D                       MPH                      OLD D
       
Where MPH = miles per hour, GR = gear ratio, D = tire diameter,
RPM = engine revolutions per min, NGR = new gear ratio  
    
Using the 2nd formula for the stock tires I get 4.8595238, that 
looks close enough to 4.86 to me. (3768 RPM).

I don't want to spoil all your fun so I'll let you play with all the 
numbers.
