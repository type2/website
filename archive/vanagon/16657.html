Subject:  '73 Safare Update - Capri seats for free
Date: Mon, 1 May 1995 09:09:25 -0700 (PDT)

Hola,
	Finished up some loose ends on the camper yesterday.  

Installed the passenger seat from the Porsche 924.  Looks good!  I would
recommend this swap to anyone considering changing out their seats.  I
now have two lowback bucket seats from a 73 Capri that need a home.  They
are structurally intact, but have some rips.  I have seat covers on them.
If nobody takes them they will be pitched in the dumpster next weekend.
Steve Maher, are you listening?  Do you want them?

I went back and bought another $8 bottle of Mobil-1 75-90 Synthetic gear
oil, rolled the bus onto a slight incline sideways and put about half of
the bottle in before the oil started to run out.  Unfortunately, this
didn't help the transmission - it still sounds like it has a bad bearing,
but the noise just started after I put in the new fluid.  I think I will
go back to non-synthetic, because the noise is annoying.

The little plate that covers the oil pickup screen was leaking quite a
bit, so I took it off again and permatexed the seals and reinstalled it.
So far so good.

Went back to the junkyard and got the drawer from the Safare.  I bowed my
head for a moment of silence and mourning at the death of one of the few
Safare Custom Campers left on the road.  I also picked up a sun visor
for the passenger side with a cute little mirror in it.  My visor had
no mirror and was always coming unclipped.  Found out by looking at lots
of busses that the right visor from my bus was from a later model, and
had a different sort of fastener on the inside, which was the cause of
the unclipping problem.  Anyone need a right side mirror from a late 70's
bus?  Yours for the cost of shipping.

-David
