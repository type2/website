Hi all 
we have decided to part with our bus. We are going to buy a Wasserboxer.
Wannabussers listen up!!  here is the skinny

74 Passenger Bus
Minimal surface rust, a few small dings, minor hail damage, otherwise body
is straight
odomoter has 45,xxx miles on it, probobly 145,000
engine leaks oil at pushrod tube seals
engine runs good
new petronix points
New brake pads, cylinders, rotor(1), caliper (1), front hoses.
Great tires. Aggresive tread on stock rims.
New KYB shocks (4)
2 new CV boots, 1 replaced cv joint. (used, but good)
Stylin' black and white cow pattern seat covers.
New black carpet from WCM.

We bought this bus to be our family car, but we really need something with
heat. Those newborns get cold easily. Decided against gas heater option.
When we purchased it, I went through and did everything I could to make it
a reliable daily driver. We have about $2800 in parts alone invested,
(I have the receipts) NOT including the origonal purchase price. Asking
$2950 obo.
