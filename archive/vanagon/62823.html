Subject: sunroof replacement ideas

Hi,

I have an older Westy top without the sunroof.  Wanted light so I bought
a used RV side window.  Tilt-out type/emergency exit.  It is HUGE, 28x36
and really opens up things. Also opens up really far, so I can play
On-Safari with the binoculars.   Rear seat has great view now.  No
screen (yet). You may consider having one of these installed at an RV
shop.  Mine cost $70 used and I DIY'd it.

  Friend with '89 Westy with smashed unit simply had a conventional car
sunroof installed for about $300.  Again, nicer than stock, and vents
well on highway.  Plus is a flush mount!  My screen will be simply a
piece of fine bug mesh with elastic sewn into a seam around it.  Giant
hair net. Have one that fits entire rear hatch right now! Works great,
cheap.  Tim
