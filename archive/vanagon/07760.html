Subject: Re: '78 Westy manual ???



&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine recently got a 1978 westfalia, and is looking for the
&gt;camper part of the owner's manual only. I assume this would be the part
&gt;that tells about the stove, refrigerator, etc. 
&gt;If anyone has an extra to sell, or knows where he can get one, or would
&gt;be willing to copy yours for a couple bucks, please let me know 
&gt;thanks

Tell your friend I'll trade an owner's manual for the tent.

But seriously folks....

He can get a new owner's manual from RMMW's Bus Stop catalog for $15-20.
If he wants he can have a photocopy of mine.

BTW Westfalia camper interiors were the same from 1976-79.  The Deluxe
models came with gas stoves and refrigerators instead of iceboxes.

and if he does want to sell the tent...
