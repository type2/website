Actually barndoor pickup is a misnomer.  They didn't have the
big engine lids, like their bus counterparts, but were
nevertheless called barndoors, and have the other barndoor
features, ie. lack of ventilation system,  the semaphores,
different dash, pedals, yadayadayadayada.

actually, the whole 'barndoor' thing is a misnomer.  Anyone seen a barn door
that opens up?  Duh.  Someone told me it was like a 'barndoor' on a union
suit, but that opens down.   Barn doors are like the cargo doors,  and an old
geezer from the netherlands said thats why they called them that.  Makes
sense.  So why someone singled out the pre 3/55 model to be 'barndoor', i
dont know.  Oughta be a different name,  INHO
