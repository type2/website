Subject: Re(2): Re(2): Rough running when Hot

Shawn,

I agree with your diagnosis of bad electical connections, especially since the
van has been sitting for over a year.  Corrosion on the connectors might cause
behavior like this, I would  think, but I wondering if this would depend on
engine temperature, since it only misfires when hot. Does that make sense?
