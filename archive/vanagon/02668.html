Subject: Re: front to rearcoolant pipes-starting to rust more than a bit!

i was thinking of just nipping down to grossmans and getting 20 feet
of
PVC pipe, fittings, and cement and doing it up.

Incidentally, i will certainly go this route on the inevitable day when the
hoses on my diesel vanagon go - i have the oi cooler which involves a 
1&quot; hose feeding from a 2&quot; inch hose in several places. I dont know what the
new hose costs but mt gue$$ i$ too much. Instead I will make up a 2&quot; Tee
with a 1&quot; leg (either in copper or PVC) and then just buy regular
rad hose from my FLAPS.  If i can hook up on BOA next summer then I'll 
bring it on the trip...
