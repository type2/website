 Martha, To register the vehicle in your name you MUST have the pink slip
signed by the seller. You should also get a bill of sale with the VIN,
date, amount paid, mileage, name address and phone numberand signature of
seller.

I would not forge the sellers name on the pink slip. If the seller was 
not the rightful owner of the car you would be an accessory to a serious 
crime. A local attorney here is being prosecuted for forging the name of 
his client on the back of a check (even though he was entitled to the money)
