Subject: No Longer a Wannabus...

Having been on the list as a wannabus for some time, I just have to tell you 
that I finally have a bus! a white '79 1600 pop-top camper (yes, we still the 
upright engine in Europe right up 'til 79). One previous owner, 17,000 miles 
from new, totally rust free underside. It's fully equipped, with a fridge, 
cooker and sink. It's so good that I'm having problems trying to find jobs to 
do on it. I've had to change the (original) cross-ply tyres, (they weren't worn 
out, it was just too frightening to drive), and I adjusted the clutch. The most 
serious job I've had do is to make a new leg to replace the missing one for the 
table. I still have to work out how to light the fridge. Seems the flint is 
sparking but it doesn't light the gas. Anyone got any experience of an 
Electrolux model 120?

Bad new is that it has already been broken into, after just 4 days of 
ownership. They put a screwdriver in between the door and the handle.  Still, 
not much damage done, and nothing taken, (there's nothing to take, not even a 
stereo - still has the blanking plate). 

Can't wait for the next service so I can really get my hands dirty!
