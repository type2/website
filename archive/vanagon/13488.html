Subject: RE: Major Child Problem /f

My son isn't old enough to have Matthew Drahzal's problem (teenager miffed
that family car is not Ferrari) but friends have solved similar situation
by promising that car will become child's when child gets driver's license.
At its most successful, this can cause unsolicited waxing, and often 
causes long periods of sitting in the driveway listening to the radio.
