&lt;&lt; Any suggestions?  Any connection to the injector &gt;&gt;
Brian.I have had this happen more than once on various German cars.The
culprit tends to be the resistor on the end of the wire.Ohm out the wire w/ a
meter if you can.The wire w/ infinity ohms is bad.You can usually just
replace the resistor end cap(get one at MBZ if VW wont sell it to you.Or buy
a complete wre set.I usually find the bad wire on my scope.If you're still
having trouble a shop w/ one will usually check it for a small charge. It is
slightly possible you,or the PO shorted the wire to the CPU, but this would
mean 2 injectors would fail as the cpu fires 2 at once.
Good Luck
