The only problem with being so close to the action up front is the birds
can really scare you!!  I have never hit so many birds while driving as with
the Vanagon.  Either the dumb birds do not recognize whats coming, or there
are unique wind currents around the front of the Vanagon that do not allow
them to GET OUT OF THE WAY!!

It is great to be above most of the rest of traffic.
