Subject:       Crazy Vanagon Sighting!

Well just when you thought you've seen it all, some enterprising VW 
owner does the improbable.

Yesterday as I was getting on the freeway to go to Salt Lake, I 
spotted the most interesting Vanagon I've ever seen.  It was gold 
with a home-made 3 foot tall plywood top attached to it!  The 
funniest part was that the plywood addition even had a pitched roof 
on it!  The front of the Vanagon also had a wood addition (apparently 
to hold luggage, etc.).

Anyhow, just thought you all might like to know!

Also on another note:

I located a '57 Double cab for sale.  No engine, wheel-whells rusted 
through, but other than that, original paint, interior, etc, the cab 
is in great shape.  I can get the guy's name/number if anyone is 
interested.
