A buddy of mine just bought a cool bus:

He got a 1960 Corner Window Deluxe, _Double Door_!!!  $3500  Small amount
of rust in a couple spots.

Another friend just bought a 1965 standard, mint condition, 77,000
original miles, original everything, $1000.  Yow!  Do I need to
tell you there is no rust?  I didn't think so.

There's also a '65 sliding door 21-window for sale, I think he wants
$3k, has some rust.

There's just been an explosion of new busses in this area...
