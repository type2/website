&gt; Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; The Edmunds home page on the WWW at:
&gt; 
&gt; gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com:70/11/magazines/alphabetic/all/edmunds
&gt; 
&gt; It lists prices for used vehicles from 1985.

I checked out this site, and some of the used car reviews it also
contains.  The Vanagon one was kind of interesting, so I thought I would
post it for those that are unable to see it.  It starts off great,
giving VW credit for inventing the minivan, but ends poorly.

&quot;Volkswagen Vanagon (1989-1991)
      Volkswagen has never been duly credited for pioneering
the  minivan  in  the 50's with the &quot;Bus.&quot; Vanagon  replaced
that venerable relic in 1980, growing in size and abandoning
the  more compact dimensions of the original. Vanagon was  a
niche vehicle, with rear-drive and an abysmally underpowered
flat  four-cylinder mounted in the rear  of  the  van.  More
recent versions were available with four-wheel-drive  and  a
conversion  that  turned  Vanagon  into  a  tiny  but  self-
sufficient  camper.  Because it  has  to  work  so  hard  to
motivate  the  Vanagon, the 90 horsepower engine  gets  poor
fuel   economy.  A  high  driving  position   affords   good
visibility, and Vanagon is quite comfortable.This van has an
enormous amount of cargo room, considering its size.  Still,
Vanagon cannot be recommended. It appeals to few, costs  too
much,  and couldn't fight its way up the side of a wet speed
bump.&quot;

I don't know about these reviews - I found typos and blatant
misinformation in some of them.  Still, they are interesting...
