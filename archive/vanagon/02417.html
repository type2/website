hmmmmm.  :)  all my info was just prior to nafta, and the folks i talked to
in customs (in seattle) didn't know how it would affect them. i had pretty
much settled on having to find what i wanted already on this side of the
border and just pay the guy whatever i could haggle him down to. i had heard
that bellingham, washington, was a good place to find these trucks. but right
about that time, i discovered i had run out of money. :(

&gt;A general question. How coordinated were/are VW's US and Canadian
&gt;operations. For example, were 92 Vanagons imported into Canada, or is there
&gt;no such beast on the planet? When I was at the dealer looking at Syncros he

the story i heard was that the 92 canadian models were eurovans ... that
north of the border there WERE 1992 vw vans (EV's), but south of the border
there were none. the vw books say that all Vanagon production stopped in
july of 1991, and production of the eurovan (T4) began in september of 1991
(for the 1992 model year).

&gt;also told me that in Canada there is a Westphalia Eurovan conversion being
&gt;sold now that is not being brought into US because - to meet DOT
&gt;requirements - the rig would cost about $45k US.

well, there is the Winnebago version of the vw eurovan camper ... one model
made for vw to sell (about $30,000 US) and another version made for winnebago
to sell (called the Riata, and it's cost is over $40,000 US). i wonder if
that's what he's talking about.

BUT! the vw transporter book i have (and some brochures from germany) show
that westfalia did NOT roll over and die ... they are happily and busily
making camper versions of the eurovan. but they sure don't look like $45K!
and several other companies are converting the eurovan as well. even the
butt-ugly eurovan pickup truck (and i DO mean ugly!) is shown in pictures
with a camper-cabin on back.

boy. can you guys just imagine if we could DRIVE from, say, labrador to
greenland to iceland to norway or some such? just being able to drive a
car all the way to europe? :)  what a trip!
