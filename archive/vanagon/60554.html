&gt;IMHO, I like automatics, but maybe a manual transmission is the way to get 
&gt;the most out of the available horsepower.

Matt:

One of the biggest selling factors to me for my EV GL was the 5-spd.  What fun
would it be to drive without one?  At 75k miles, no problems yet.  Shifts
smoothly, well geared to engine, plenty of power, cruise control holds at 70mph
uphill.  Every other van on the market in the states is only available with
auto.  Get the 5-spd while they're still available on this planet!.
