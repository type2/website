Subject: Re: Bob's Epic Saga


Epic is the right word.  Grendel is the right name.  I've been following 
the story through the vanagon list.  Bobowolf slays the monster Grendel.  
Well worthy of a book together with his other writings.  I've heard he's 
not interested in writing a book.  All he really needs is an editor to 
put together what he already writes.

 I strongly feel his writngs compare favorably to works such as Zen and 
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

&gt;      I've been keeping up with Bob's hair-ball run on the WWW page - but
&gt;      I'm glad you're cross-posting these the the vintage list for everyone
&gt;      to read.
&gt; 
&gt;      Thought I would let you know that I agree with your comments regarding
&gt;      Bob Hoover writing his memoirs.  He writes with a lot of style and
&gt;      class - his descriptions of working under Grendel make me feel muddy
&gt;      just reading them.  I'm sure his life is filled with similar stories
&gt;      that - told in his unique style - would be worth reading.  I'd pay
&gt;      $21.95 for 'em anyway.
&gt; 
&gt;      I feel that Bob's serial story of trying to deal with Grendel is a
&gt;      tale of epic proportions.  A kind of vision quest.  A man, maybe a
&gt;      little over the hill - but driven by a vision of what he wants to do,
&gt;      goes off to solve some personal problems and ends up in a classical
&gt;      struggle with sometimes indifferent and often malevolent gods -
&gt;      represented or symbolized by the local FLAPS, the local junkies,
&gt;      unfriendly natives, and - above all - Grendel...  a tale of struggle,
&gt;      woe, near-defeat - and (hopefully) ressurection (of Grendel) and
&gt;      victory!
&gt; 
&gt;      keep up the good work!
