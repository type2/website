Subject: Re: VW's Hydraulic Shop Press


&gt;If anybody expresses any interest to me (like telling me what price they
&gt;would pay), I might be able to buy another press this weekend at another VW
&gt;dealer auction I know about and am going to.
&gt;
&gt;derekdrew_at_aol_dot_com but I am gradually migrating to drew_at_interport_dot_net.
&gt;

I don't know about being interested in a shop press, but there are usually a 
lot of cool things at dealer auctions.  Where in the heck are these auctions 
you are going to?
