Lakeport packing list:

Keeping with my past &quot;retentivenes,&quot; and in answer to someone's query
for such, here's the recommended packing list for Lakeport:

reservation/confirmation/number info or tix for the Lakeport fairgrounds
     firewood - we'll bring some, plus 1/2 of an engine case.  If you can
     each bring a small bundle of firewood, we ought to be able to have a
     nice fire Friday evening and Sat morning over at the coast, where it
     will be cool (hopefully).  In Lakeport, where it will be awful hot, I
     guess we won't be needing a fire  :)
folding chairs - 1 per person in your group
ice - lots
smores - if you want them.  I'm sick of them, personally.  Been camping too
     much lately  :)
food/drink for all your meals - no potluck seems easier this time
paper towels, cups, plates, utensils, napkins, etc.
snacks/beer to share if you wish
between meal snacks:  nuts, chips, cookies, etc
