Subject: Re: Arbitrating VW - Vanagon Head Gaskets

&gt;and ask them to pay 100%.  They said they would
&gt;only go 50% and that I could take it to arbitrations
&gt;to try and get more.
&gt;
&gt;Is there anyone out there that has done this on this
&gt;old of a vehicle and won ?
&gt;

I'd say take the money, VWoCanada told me to screw off on my '87 Syncro, YMMV.
