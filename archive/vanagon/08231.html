steve no offense taken. in the year we lived in CA (Palo Alto) it never
ceased to amaze me the number of accidents that occured during foggy or
rainy conditions on the highway. Why? because people simply follow too closely
and no amount of fog light is going to stop that.... -- try driving in
a blizzard storm on the 400 up here and see how silly following closely
really is...safe driving through scary experiences for most of us
