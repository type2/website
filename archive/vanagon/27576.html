I'm sort of trying to accumulate all the parts to do a conversion like the
one mentioned above.  I have a Vanagon diesel and a '84 Jetta 1.6TD (70
hp), which is in mid-rebuild now.  A main problem is that the regular
diesel Vanagon left side motor mount and cradle bar is right smack in the
way of the Jetta turbo waste gate.  I believe the German market TD
transporters must have had a different mount and cradle bar.  The
manifolds and turbo could have been different from the Jetta, too. 

Does anyone know of a European dismantler who may have these parts?  
Yeah, I know, it's a long shot.  

Oh well, I don't speak German anyway.

p.s.  There is a &quot;mechanic&quot; around here who does this conversion, but his 
home made mounts seem very expensive and poorly engineered, to me.
