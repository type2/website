Well dudes, I've checked and even sniffed the carpet (but not kissed) and
no sign of any fluid (human or otherwise). Said carpet was peeled back
and carefully inspected. The rear master was also checked and no sign of
fluid on the ground. Unless this stuff is real smart and can somehow find
its way down the clutch line and out to a waiting getaway car, I am still
at a loss to explain its mysterious disappearance. The Cardassians have
had their way, this day.

OK so if the fluid isn't leaking out the front master and the car hasn't
moved since the last top-up, the only other way it could leak out is through
the
force of gravity. So my next job is to find the &quot;lowest point&quot; in the van
and that's where the fluid will be. Not.
