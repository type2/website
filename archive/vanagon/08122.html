Subject: Re: *Front* Engine *Compartment* Seal

&gt;
&gt;If I could install a front *engine* seal without pulling the engine that 
&gt;*would* be a neat trick wouldn't it?! ABRACADABRA.....
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Should be able to do this, it's been a while since I last tried it. Be 
prepared to squeeze your body into the engine compartment to reach behind 
the fan shroud. And likewise to crawl under the van and pull the foam gasket 
through all around while trying to get it smoothed out.   tim s.
