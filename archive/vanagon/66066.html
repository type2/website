Subject:      gas heater info

Hi All,

Just a reminder for those who have joined since the type-2 split.  Lots
of heater info is avail. in older archives, for both BN-4 and
BA-6(newer) models.  And likely much more in Type-2 list archives.
Eberspacher/Espar, the makers, no longer support these two models, but
have literature/service bulletins avail.  Overload them with requests
and you may kill a valuable resource.  They do not have much in parts,
if any, for either heater, particularly the older BN-4.

Mr. Mirvis already has a well established reputation, let's leave it at
that.  There is also JBHeaters, in Castleton, Colorado?? for gasheater
work. Someone please correct me if that is incorrect.

Both Dan Houg, myself, and many others have rebuilt the older BN-4s,
they sell DOA for $25/free around here, and can often be revived with
TLC. Bentley manual troubleshoots well the BA-6 (75-91 vans) There are
some simple tricks to getting them working again, but if you do need new
parts, dig deep, they cost LOTS of $$.  Buying 2-3 dead heaters is a
good idea.  Don't be afraid to buy a rusty one, the outer case is tin,
comes right off for sandblast/cleanup, innards are all stainless steel,
no probs. Eyeball the wiring/relays for decent appearance.  Try to find
the newer BN-4 models with fuel 'dosing' pump and NOT pump+regulator
style. Absolutely avoid the Stewart-Warner 'BN-4' versions (SouthWind?)
that were installed in early busses.  These have lousy safety shut offs
and are the heaters that gave all gas heaters their bad reputation.

Lastly, Webasto makes gas/diesel heaters for hot air (Thermo-Top).
Good, modern, solid state controls, thermostats/timers etc.  But figure
on $1000 to get it done properly. Considering prices of $550 for
refurbed BN-4s I've seen for sale, this is not a bad deal.   They also
sell a water heater, factory option in Canadian Syncros, $2000+. Webasto
is more into semi-truck installations, VW size is smallest.

bye, Tim
