Subject: Re: Testing Generator and Volt. Reg.

Hi - as far as I know that's where the Regulator always is in busses. you can
get to it under the oil cleaner platform. Easier if you move all the spark
wiresand hoses. It is very hard but impossible to remove the Gen if you have
the right tools that bend around blind corners and if you're Gen is mounted
to the fan shroud with bolts and not screws. Remember, the Gen is actually
held on by a strap on the Generator Stand/oil filler. You can take off the
Carb too to get to it. Be patient and use mirrors. On your other major point
- I don't know how to do those tests - but I do know that a weak battery is
hard ona Generator. Also alot of the major chains of autoparts retailers will
test your batt and gen for free. Maybe not a panacea, but a good free
doublecheck on your work. Good Luck.
