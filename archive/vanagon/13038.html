Subject: Hi-tops

Joel,
	Thanks for the info Joel. I certainly think I'll be going over to 
unleaded. I'll give a few dealers a ring and let you know what they say.

	There seem to be quite a lot of Hi-Tops over here on all types of vans.
Mine was done by a small local company, the conversion is refered to as a Komet.
 A couple of the larger companies that do Hi-tops are Sheldon and Euro Motor Caravans. They sell these to other converters
or they just get copied. They are all fibre glass shells, high at the back 
sloping down to the front. If I have time I'll do an  ascii picture to give you
an impression of the shape. They seem to be pretty aerodynamic and in normal 
conditions don't cause any major problems. I don't know how much they affect the 
e mpg though. Last summer on a trip to Germany I was getting an average of 25 
mpg, thats about 20 US which seems to be standard. It was mainly steady autobahn
driving so it seems a pretty decent figure. Compared to a normal car though it is 
is low, gas is pretty expensive over here. Another good reason for going unleaded
ed.
	A quick note to Jim in Arizona. Thanks for invite. My mother in law has
moved to Pheonix so next time we come stateside we sure to visit. The last visit
took in Austin, Seattle and L.A. It can get pretty expensive in flight costs.
Maybe next time we visit somebody might want to lend/hire me camper, I could 
return the favour for a tour of Europe.
	There's an idea maybe we could organise a transatlantic swap list.
