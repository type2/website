Subject: W pretour Jan.


Since it's Friday (aka &quot;stat&quot; day), here's the list of people I have
potentially attending the Pfeiffer Big Sur weekend on the (wet/
frozen) green, plus what you've signed up to bring for in the way
of food, if you have.  

Would those of you definitely NOT planning to attend at this point 
please let me know, so that I can better plan what's necessary for
our Friday evening potluck (Jan. 6th)?  

Also, for any more of you--new or otherwise to this list--let me
know if you're interested in joining us, and I'll forward you more
information.

Thanks,
