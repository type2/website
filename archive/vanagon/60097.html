Subject: Mechanical Advice

Greetings Brother &amp; Sister Westy Folk,
	I have been telling my friends at work that I became officially 
and instantly cool on Sunday afternoon. I purchased a '72 Westfalia for 
$550.00 Cdn. It is in amazing shape for the price and for the year. Came 
with two engines no less.
	I am afraid it has not moved for six years. Not a problem, it is 
still in great shape. As you might expect, a number of components have to 
be freed up. The brakes for example...

	The roaters look new but need to be cleaned, the pads are new, 
the pistons are siezed in the calipers. Is there a way to free these up?

	The master cylinder seems stiff. I could not immedately depress 
the brake pedal. I can now but I have to pull the brake peddle back up. I 
 checked underneath and the failure to spring back into place seems to be 
a function or misfunction of the Master Cylinder.

	Any advice?

	I expect these are simple matters for most but I know little.

	Thank You.

		Christopher.
