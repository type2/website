Subject:       Cracked expansion tank

I seem to have a recurring problem with the coolant expansion tank in 
my '87 Vanagon. It develops cracks around the filler neck that 
gradually stretch until they leak coolant when pressurized and suck 
air when the system cools off. The result is a small amount of air in 
the tank when the system is cool, which results in the red LED above 
the temp gauge flashing when my wife drives the van in the morning. 
Of course, when I check it later, when it is warm, the coolant has 
expanded and the indicator is off.

I replaced the tank several years ago for the same problem. Of 
course, it was pretty expensive for a plastic bottle.  Is there any
 way to repair polyethylene (most glues don't stick)? 

I see where someone else had this problem a month back. Is this a 
design defect in the tank? 

Rich.
