Subject: Brake fluid question


	Jonathan,
	Pardon me, but it sounds like you're kinda new to this.
	Use DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid- DOT 4 is slightly better, costs
slightly more. Your common or garden variety VW does have rubber seals,
as do every other hydraulic-braked vehicle I've ever heard of. Perhaps
you mean you've heard some european cars have natural rubber seals and
seem only to be happy with Castrol brake fluid. True of Triumph TR-6s,
according to my friend Steve, but not true of VWs. I happen to use
Castrol anyway, its good stuff. But VW brake seals are 'normal' as far
as I know and don't require specific fluid.

	You can, if you wish to clean out your entire system and replace
most of it, use DOT5 silicone fuild. I wouldn't if you're just after
a bleed and refill experience. DOT5 and DOT3/4 DO NOT MIX, so you have
to COMPLETELY clean out the old fluid and probably good idea to replace
all the rubber seals- doesn't sound like this is what you have in mind.
Don't let the guy at FLAPS sell you DOT5 then.

	Note that if your system is really old and its been a long long
time since it was bled, vigorously pumping the master cylinder may well
rake it's seals across crud that's collected in there and tear
the seals. So you start with a working, soft, brake system that needs
a flush and bleed, and you do that and wind up with a leaking system
that needs a new master cylinder. So go easy, maybe don't pump full strokes?

	Keep flushing fluid through until it runs clean at all four
bleeder nipples- starting with the one furthest from the master cylinder
and working toward it. Maybe a pint will do it, maybe 2, or more. Keep
going until what you get out looks like what you're pouring in.

	Save all the awful looking old brake fluid and pour it into
the empty bottles the new fluid came in. Brake fluid is Hazardous Waste.
Don't, PLEASE don't, pour it into engine oil and then give that to a
recycling place. The brake fluid contaminates just as much oil as it
encounters, and everything will have to be incinerated. Call your local
toxic control people in the city or county g'umnt. They'll either 
be able to take it or point you to someone who will.

	Happy Motoring!

	Bill
