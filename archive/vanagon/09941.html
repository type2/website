Subject: Re: More on Westy Interior changes, '68-'72

On Fri, 13 Jan 1995, michael.heron_at_utoronto_dot_ca (Michael Heron) braggeth:
&gt; 
&gt; I happen to have a Westy manual for 1967 Campmobile's :):). It is a
&gt; photocopy, and is not 100% complete but it is a completists wet dream. tell
&gt; you what joe;, you send me a copy of your 68-72 manual, and i'll send you
&gt; one of my 67' is it a deal?

Sounds good.  It may take me a few days to arrange xerography - strictly 
for hobbyist purposes, of course.

[snip]

&gt; &gt;Anyhoo, some notable changes (doing this sans book, now):
&gt; &gt;
After a re-scan, most of these changes came about with the '71 model 
Here's more:
Jumpseat behind driver loses electrical cutout; before '71, area between 
driver's and jumpseat seatbacks is accessible thru &quot;kleenex&quot;-type slot; 
later just an open bin.  **Great Frisbee storage, spot, BTW! :-)**  
There's a separate part number fur Kanada, no doubt to placate some 
bizarre and healthy custom of them blue-skinned folk rumored to live 
somewhere north of Macon.

Table clip-down changes (improved, IMHO).  110V (or whatever else y'all 
use outside of Leon County) supply arrangement goes from fused to 
circuit-protectored (anyone got that original VW extension cord -- das 
Stromlieferungskabel, Teile-Nr. ZVW 222 117 ?).

But how could I have forgotten the curtains?  By the end of '71, you've 
lost those absolutely KILLER (sano, too, man) sliding-track curtains 
over the doors, to be replaced with a three-panel snap-on up front and a 
cheesy rod-and-pocket deal on the sliding door.  Oh pale echo of thy 
former glory!  At least they're not orange yet.  IMVHO the earlier curtains 
are the most _intense_ automotive curtains ever produced.  I am very 
serious and will engage you in a distastrous (and brilliantly 
puerile) flamewar if you contradict me.  Man.

Joe, man.

PS East-coasters I'll be there in spirit but am between vans.  Besides, 
I've just barely succeeded in convincing myself my fingernails look 
better without the van, &amp; don't want to threaten this fragile, false 
reality I've concocted for myself.

Joe Clark                                          Where there's no sense,
joeclark_at_freenet.scri.fsu_dot_edu                          there's no feeling.
