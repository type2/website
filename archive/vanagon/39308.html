My wife gave birth to our first daughter yesterday (Easter).  So, in a few
years I will have someone to fetch:tools, beer, Mom (when repairs get too
difficult)
She's about this long &lt;Motions with hands&gt;
and weighs about seven pounds.  Oh yeah, she is a red head.  I guess i am
not 100% Cherokee Indian, like my dad claims to be.
