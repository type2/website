Subject: RE: Bug ballet - anyone interested? and VW count du jour

Anthony got this in the mail yesterday, and I thought 
I thought I would pass it along, since there are 
probably at least a few bug owners out there.

Are there any bug owners interested in being in a 
*bug ballet* to be held this Sun., Sept. 18, in 
Staten Island, NY? Bugs of New York will be part of 
this fall's Dancing in the Streets' Festival NYC. 

According to the pamphlet, Jennifer Schlosberg has 
done similar bug ballets, in LA, Durham, NC, and 
Cleveland. Anyone who wants to participate should 
meet at 1:00 p.m. at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 
1000 Richmond Terrace (2 miles west of Staten Island 
Ferry Terminal). She will give you directions when 
you call her at (212) 592-3064. Performance will be 
at 3:00 p.m. 

The information came thru Conn. VW Association, in 
case you want to know how we got it. We cannot vouch 
for the lady or her intentions - it's the first I've 
heard of anything like this. Like I said, I'm just 
passing the info along!

By the way, Joel, put us down for a 70 bus (I 
checked) in addition to the 62, 2 66's and 2 67's.
