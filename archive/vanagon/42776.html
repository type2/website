Subject: Problems with my 83' Westie

        Ack! So last night I decided to take 'The Mystery Machine&quot; (it got
named on the weekend after my girlfreind bought me a Scooby-Doo coloring
book) out for a little ride, just around my  neighbourhood, cause I just
cannot wait till Friday when it gets insured. I'm supposed to be leaving
Friday afternoon with a freind to go do some hiking up in Jasper, but all
of a sudden I have one or two problems. Hopefully I can get them remedied
by tommorow night but.......

Problem #1)  So, the first thing that happened was I went to rlease the
emergency break, pushed in the little end button and as soon as I did I
felt a great release of tension. Probabaly more than there should have
been. Sure enough, when I went to pull up the break again, there was no
tension at all, which I assume means that the cable broke? or else it needs
some MAJOR retightening? Is this right, and if so HOW DO I FIX IT? what
parts will I need?

Problem #2) I hadnt driven it in about a week and a half, but it started
fine, although the battery seemed like it needed a little charging. SO i
drove it around for about half an hour or so , and then went I got home I
turned it off, then forgot that I had to park on the street, and went to
restart it. Well it almost didnt start up, it sounded like the battery was
damn near dead. Suggestions?

        And in a related incidednt, I was cleaning it all up on the
weekend, and flippedd the battery check light near the stove. It was
red......so I started up the van and soon enough it was back on Green, but
the next timne I went out to check it again, it had gone back to red.
        Is this just how that battery light thing works, or is my battery
having major trouble holding any sort of charge? Could I just take it down
to Crappy Tire and get them to charge it back up or what?

longhairedandoftenmistakenforahippieeventhoughI'mnot. (dechipher that one!)

thanks for the help in advance. (cause Im really hopeing someone can help
me on this)
