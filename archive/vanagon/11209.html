&gt; This ASCII VW ART entity seems to be repeating, coming around again or 
&gt; whatever American term one cares.
&gt; 
&gt; Can (will) someone please explain what to do with it, how to apply it, what good is 
&gt; it or to whom it is direct.  Specifics please!!!
&gt; 
&gt;basically, it just kinda looks neat, and you can put it in your
signature file. I have it in my z-mail file, but not the much easier to
use e-mail...
it it neat though.
