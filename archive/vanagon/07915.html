&gt; Don't use it as a condom.

when we used to go out in my 68 and decide to &quot;get it on&quot;, but we 
discovered we forgot the condoms, the duct tape (or duck tape) was one 
thing we could be SURE was in the van.

we just made sure that there were no gaps by pulling it tight and
overlapping by 20 to 50 percent each time around. 

worked great for us, till time to take it off.... i still have scars.
