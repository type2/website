Subject: idle fixed in 83 westy

Hey Volks,

I finally got my idle fixed in my 83.5 westy. Turns out it was the #3
injector not spraying correctly. The shop I took it to (Denson's in
Somerville, NJ) did a good job and they seemed to know what they were
doing. After cleaning the injectors and changing the fuel filter and
bypassing the idle stab it idles smooth. Its not perfect and he told me it
wouldn't be so until I changed the injector. I just wanted to thank
everyone who gave me advice on trying to fix the problem. I'm just glad to
have my westy back (and inspected too! :)
Thanks again and happy bus'in.

Cheers,
Dave
