Subject: Charcoal Grill lighting

(Vanagon content) For the next gathering of Vanagon campers......

Y'all might want to check out the web site http://ghg.ecn.purdue_dot_edu/.  They 
have a new technique for lighting the charcoal grill.  First you pour 5 
gallons of liquid oxygen on the 60lb pile of charcoal.  Then you light it 
and 3 seconds later 40lbs of it is gone.....


Bradley - are you there?????


Just in time for the next campout.

Dean
