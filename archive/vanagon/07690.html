So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; &gt;way for you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;BTW, Why is it when I have a comparitively minor problem, someone
&gt; &gt;else has a much worse one?  ;P
&gt; 
&gt; Its a _streak_!  I got rear-ended in my 911 on the way to work this 
&gt; morning!!!!!

Sounds more like a virus to me...  ;)
