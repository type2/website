Subject: Mystery Wire('81 Westy)

Hello all,

Whiling away the time cleaning the engine and compartment, I came upon a 
wire(cable) with a connector that has three pins in it, and is about an inch and 
a half long.  Black/round(1/2&quot; diameter).  It looks like it comes through the 
firewall somewhere ...crosses over cylinders 1&amp;2 tin, but travels under the 
intake manifold(fuel injected).  The end was lying sorta hidden under one of 
those tubes that you can take off easily...like a crankcase vent, or something. 
Nothing seems wrong...just curious....what is it?

Thanks,
Gene (Edward:'81 Westy)
