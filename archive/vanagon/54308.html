It's on the web site at
http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/vanagon/Files/Propane-Manuals-89-Westy.zip

Some of the filenames have spaces in them. This could cause a problem for some
people.  When I or Bo get a chance, we should rename them so more people can
get to them, but they're out there now.
