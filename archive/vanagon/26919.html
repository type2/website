Subject: Re: Best Dealer To Buy Parts From (Don't Skip This Post)

Drew,

This is very interesting and I'm sure will help a lot of us.

Questions:  Can I get parts fiches from the dealer? 
            How much do they cost?
            Is there multiple fiches per model and year?

BTW there is one dealer here that will give a 15% discount if I say I'm 
buying for an auto repair shop.  I haven't tried this myself, but my 
father has used them for his '86 GL. 

How does that compare to 20% over cost?

Thanks for the info,

Trace Choulat

&gt; Recently I conducted a test to find out which was the VW dealer offering
&gt; factory VW parts at the lowest prices. I composed a bid form with about 25
&gt; different factory parts I intended to buy new, and I sent this form to a
&gt; half dozen dealers around the country to see which really offered the lowest
&gt; prices.
&gt; 
&gt; Included in my survey were 
&gt; 
&gt; Joel Walker's friend Jim Ellis at VW Atlanta
&gt; Sonnen Motors in California
&gt; Bob Hoy's VW in Texas
&gt; Paul Walser Volkswagen in Phoenix, Az
&gt; 
&gt; I mentioned in my bid to Paul Walser Volkswagen that I had heard on the
&gt; Vanagon List that they were willing to sell parts at 20% over their cost to
&gt; people like me (Internet Vanagonatics). The Walser people responded promptly
&gt; and their prices were lower than all the other dealers by a significant
&gt; margin on all parts but one obscure one. 
&gt; 
&gt; Accordingly, I placed my order with Walser, directing them to send the parts
&gt; UPS. I live in New York, but it is better to buy the parts from an out of
&gt; state dealer so as to avoid 8% sales tax. As for the UPS shipping charges,
&gt; in general they are not significant so it doesn't matter which state I am
&gt; ordering from.
&gt; 
&gt; In the future, I plan to buy all factory parts from Walser without going
&gt; through the effort to get bids from different dealers. I am submitting this
&gt; post to recomend that other list members do the same. Be sure to mention the
&gt; Internet and the 20%-over-cost program to get your proper discount.
&gt; 
&gt; I conducted the entire operation by fax and have never spoken to anyone at
&gt; Walser. Here is there phone numbers 
&gt; 
&gt; Paul Walser Volkswagen
&gt; Phoenix, Az 85016
&gt; 800-876-5199
&gt; fax: 602-265-8768
&gt; 
&gt; List members may wish to copy the 800# and label it something like &quot;Cheap
&gt; Factory Parts By Mail&quot; and keep it handy.
&gt; 
&gt; I used to buy my VW parts from the local dealer here but I cannot get over
&gt; how silly this is. You pay sales tax. You often have to go to the dealer
&gt; twice--once to order and once to take delivery. You have to wait in line.
&gt; You pay full price or a high price. Who needs it? Go 800 and do something
&gt; more productive with your time and money.
&gt; 
&gt; The one caveat is that I supplied the part numbers and asked them to double
&gt; check some of them. If you lack a microfiche you might be forced to go to
&gt; your local dealer to look at the thing and make sure you have the right
&gt; parts before ordering. But now with the recent innovation appearing on this
&gt; list of how to get a cheap microfiche reader (Radio Shack 50X $7 microscope)
&gt; there is no excuse: all list members should get their own fiches.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, before finalizing my order I called up the Parts Place and found
&gt; that when they could supply a part, it was about 60% of the cost of buying
&gt; that same part from the dealer. Accordinly, I gave the Parts Place my
&gt; business for these parts.
