David,

My propane tank last for 10+ days only running the fridge.  The aux battery
will only run the fridge for about 3 hrs.

&gt; I am going for a weekend camping (primitive) in my 86 westie and would 
&gt; like an idea of how long a full propane tank will last running the 
&gt; fridge and also to cook some meals it seams to me the tank is a bit 
&gt; small for the job?
&gt; i could run fridge from aux battery but think that would not last as 
&gt; long
&gt; btw I looking for a rplacement sliding door panel and also a rear door 
&gt; panel( vynal) the some PO has butcherde the installation of four 
&gt; speakers and i would like to get it back to new condition
&gt; Thanks all
