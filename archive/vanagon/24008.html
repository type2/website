&gt;&gt;Because, he explained, as I drive home from work,
&gt;&gt;   And I drive at the speed-limit posted,
&gt;&gt;All the cars on the road zoom by, faster than me,
&gt;&gt;   So the speedo just has to be toasted!

&gt;What part of Southen California does this guy live in?

actually, it happened in birmingham, alabama ... and is a true story.
the guy actually brought his car in because people were passing him on the
interstate when he was driving the speed limit!!!

and the worst part is that the mechanics took his word that something was
wrong without checking first. old Tom spent several hours on that one.
