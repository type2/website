&gt;Quick question, why are there 13 93 EVs, and 1 95 on the yearly
&gt;breakdown, and on the type breakdown only 9 EVs? Is this a
&gt;rear-engined conspiracy? Perhaps the second bus theory??

because, you legal-twit, there are 14 total EVs that i have seen on the
electronic highway, but only 9 of those are on the vanagon list. see?
