Subject: Re: vanagon parts/All Euro Auto Supply??

Anyone know anything about these people?  Was browsing for Audi stuff, they
sell some vanagon parts.  site is www.business_dot_com/euro/vw.htm , then hit
home and check specials etc.  I found the parts below under the Audi
specials list... Bilsteins $73/85 R/F, CAT 118, ex. pipes 75/83, muffler 148
etc.  Don't know how these prices compare to other suppliers.  Anyhow, if
anyone has comments pls. mail me.  The Audi stuff is decently priced (it
seems)   tim
