Well, way back when I was a drugstore delivery boy in high school, I
had the fun job of driving around South Bend, Indiana to deliver nice
drugs to all the folks around this mostly flat midwestern town.

One day in the middle of winter I was driving the 71 (or so) breadloaf
down a nice straight country road, probably too fast.  It was snowing,
and the streets were slippery, but not icy, as far as I remember.  I
was tooling along at probably 35-45 MPH and emerged from a part of the
road surrounded by trees to a part with long, open yards.  A nice
northerly blast of wind caught me by surprise, and suddenly I found
myself, no kidding, two thirds of the way into someone's front yard,
probably about 100 ft, in about 1 foot of snow, and UPRIGHT.

Amazed, and probably a little dazed, I just started it up and drove
right back out to the street and went merrily(?) on my way.

I guess I didn't learn, because later in college I did a nice 360 with
my then girlfreind with my (now don't flame me ;) 66 econoline.  This
was more due to black ice than to cross winds though.


Rather than slow down when driving in snow, I just moved south....

and then west.
