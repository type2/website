Subject: Driver-side rear-view mirrors

Does anyone have any ideas on how to keep the driver-side rear-view mirror
from closing up against the van body at freeway speeds?  The mirror is on an
'84 Vanagon Wolfsburg.  I have tried to fix it 3 times with no success.  So
far I've replaced the mirror, taken it apart and tightened the inside bolts,
and taken it apart again and used a metal file to try and &quot;rough up&quot; the
metal on the interior pivot ball.  Now I'm driving down the freeway holding
the mirror in place (talk about windy!!).  Any help will be greatly
appreciated!

TIA
Donna
