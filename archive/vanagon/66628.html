Remove the headlight, inspect for cracks. Pour Windex (or glass cleaner)
and water in the headlight and swish around. A small rag and a chopstick
can be used to wipe the inside of the headlight - but you have to manuver
around the bulb housing.

If your headlights are building condensation, you might want to consider
replacing the bulb, as sometimes the seal around the bulb gets old and
allows air and water to enter the lamp housing.
