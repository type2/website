&gt; Next - the fuel lines, as soon as I find a source for the long lengths of
&gt; F/I (plastic?) hose.

&gt; Thanks for listening

WHY? (he's already replaced the rubber hoses)

I'm being serious here, any body got reason to suspect that the hard 
plastic stuff for vanagons is a problem?  Never even considered 
replacing any of it, mine looks good, no evidence of problems and is 
largely shielded from UV under the van so unless someone gives me 
good reason I'm not apt to replace, seems like it was a great upgrade 
over late Bus steel line to me.
