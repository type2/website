On the commercial for the phone company about working from home- it is the one
that starts with a guy pulling distributors and ignition wires out of cars and
throwing them into a shopping cart -switches to a scene of backed up cars on a
road--  in that second (?) scene, towards the back of the road in the traffic
jam, in the center is a white and green splittie
