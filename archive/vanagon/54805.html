Subject: Re: Stickers?? 

I have not seen them yet.

My understanding that they are simular to oval international country badges, but instead of 
showing USA, D, ..., etc., these badges show &quot;VW&quot;.  Then, along the bottom and inside the 
border, is &quot;Vanagon_at_lenti,med,umn,edu&quot; is printed in 3/16&quot; letters.
