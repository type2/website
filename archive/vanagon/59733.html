Hey all,
I attended a great VW show today.  It was called Circle Yer Wagons and is
apparently annual.  It was in Sevierville, TN, which is pretty darn close
to Knoxville.  I was tipped off to the show by lister Ted Finesman and got
directions from Dave Easterwood.

The show started Friday night, when lots of folks arrived and camped on the
fairgrounds there.  I was not there as I was busy getting home from
college/unpacking/etc.  This morning, I headed down to Sevierville after an
oil change (I needed it badly).

I found the place easy enough, right by the Pigeon River.  There were many
Volkswagens.  I paid my $5 to get in (one-day pass) and looked around.  I
eventually found the Georgia contingent and spoke to a fellow there who
told me where I could find Mr. Easterwood.  I asked Dave if he knew if Ted
Finesman was there.  Dave pointed me to Ted's Bus.  I headed over, and sure
enough, there was Ted in his Type2 T-shirt :-) .

Ted has a very nice '75 Bus with a custom (and very well done) interior. 
Ted is also a goldsmith and displayed the VW jewelry he has made.  Very
nice stuff.  

Ted and I checke out the goodies at the show when a fellow approached us,
noticing Ted's shirt.  He identified himself as Blake Sartin.  Blake had
with him a fellow named Pete who is also on the list and a fellow named
Rick.  Blake has a '69 Westy, Rick has a '78 Bus, and Pete has a Bus, and
for the life of me I can't remember the year.

So we all chatted about all kinds of things, checked out each other's
Buses, etc.  We made the rounds of the show:

Numerous Type 1s, including a very nice split window Beetle, absolutely
100% gorgeous.  There was also a 1954 Beetle, equally gorgeous.  Then there
were the ugly Bajas and the lowered POS's.  There were quite a few nice
stock Beetles though.

Many Type 2s.  Mostly Westies, lots of loaves and a few splitties too. 
There was a '57 Westy that was absolutely gorgeous, a 21-window deluxe with
LOTS of rust around every window, a '72 with a Westy interior but a top
that popped straight up, a highroof loaf, and many more that I can't
remember right now.  A few Vanagon Westies, but not many.

Only a couple Type 3s, all squarebacks.  One had a Type 4 engine in it,
very poorly done.

No Type 4s.

Very few Karmann Ghias, one really nice red one and an older green one that
was for sale.  

The vendor/swap section was OK, there were a few vendors who were WAY
overpriced (like $20 for a Hot Wheels Vanagon).  

There was a parade, which was cool.  The parade was police-escorted,
through the streets of Sevierville.  Very cool.  

There was a bug-bash, where you pay your money and get a chance to pound a
stripped Beetle with a sledgehammer.  Why can't they use a Honda or
Oldsmobile instead?  That would be much more entertaining.  However, I can
report that a Beetle roof does not stand up too well to a 10-lb sledge.

The show continues through Sunday, with camping at the site.  I only went
for Saturday as Sunday is mother's day and my mom has decreed that we all
have to be here :-) .  Sunday is the day of the &quot;engine blow.&quot;  

Not a bad show, kinda small but a good turnout for this area.  I had a good
time and got a little sunburn as well :-)

Still looking forward to BOTBR 

Sean
