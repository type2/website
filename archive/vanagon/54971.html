Subject: Re: Battery light staying on till I hit the gas?

could it be that you live where it is cold and that the light is staying
on because the alternato belt isn't charging the battery until it goes
around a bit?....this is happening to me but it also happened in my jeep,
only when it was cold, both had new batteries while this
happened....anybody buy this? jarrett

What we call luck is the inner man externalized, we make things happen to 
us.
