Subject: Re[2]: Dometic Refrig finally working on gas

     I do not have AC in my westy.  Most of these miles have been with the 
     windows down....  Hair flowin' in the breeze.  Miles gently wafting 
     under the splendor and majesty of my trusty steed.
     
     I'm thinking of naming my van Govinda.  Govinda was the loyal and 
     trusted friend of the wandering ascetic Siddhartha in the Herman Hesse 
     novel, Siddhartha. 
     
     Awwww.  It sucks to be at work on a sunday.  :-(

Hey all,
I've noticed that when driving with the fridge lit on propane, rolling 
down the driver's window usually causes the flame to extinguish.  I 
think it's setting up some kind of draft or suction.  Any ideas from 
anyone?
     
Sean
