Evening all!

Ok, I'll skip the Porsche engine idea.  You convinced me.  Well, just for
fun I pulled the #1 rocker arm off of the Bust.  I pulled out the pushrod
and noticed it was hollow.  Aren't the hollow pushrods supposed to go into
motors that don't have hydraulic lifters?  If so, what sort of ramifications
could this have for the engine.  The solid pushrods cost a bunch more $$$ so
there must be something.

After I put the rocker arm back on I noticed that I could compress the #1
exhaust lifter but not the intake lifter (by pushing on the lower end of the
rocker arm).  Does this imply that the lifter needs to be removed &amp;
cleaned/bled?  Ugh.  This thing could end up as a pile of parts yet...

Ok, another topic.  How much work is it to replace a front axle beam?  I
found a 74 camper with a cracked axle so I'm curious.  I haven't looked at
it but from what the guy described the entire beam should be replaced.  He
said the wheel wobbled (but didn't fall down).

TIA,

Bob J.
