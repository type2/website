&gt; I think I feels a song commin' on
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What a day for a daydream
&gt; What a day for a daydreamin' goy (in honor of this bein Yom Kipper)
&gt; Now I'm lost in a daydream
&gt; Packin the EuroVan for Busses by the Bouy....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, whatdaya want for nuthin?  ...... Rubber bisket?
&gt; 
&gt; Now I ask you who can ID the above quote?

Well...It's quoted by Dan Akroid(sp?) at the end of his song on
the Blues Brothers album.  Can't think of the songs name though. 

Do I when a prize???? ;)
