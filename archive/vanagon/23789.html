Subject: Re: Battery Plate plus leak question

&gt;hiya,
&gt;
&gt;okay, one thing i've forgotten to do (forgotten cuz of these #$%#_at__at_! joints!)
&gt;is that i need to do something for my battery. the battery side has rusted out.
&gt;...there's no plate where the batter goes. right now i (get this) have a
&gt;pice of wood stuck in there that seems to fit finte but i need to find some
&gt;way to secure the battery. should i go ahead and fork over the $$$ to have
&gt;something weld something in? right now the $$$ is low. how much should
&gt;something like that cost?
&gt;
&gt;one the other side, i noticed it's leaking...maybe through the air vents?
&gt;there's a good inch of water...any suggestions on stopping that? i'm thinking
&gt;about drilling a hole through the plate so the water won't stand. any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;thanks yet again,
&gt;
&gt;

Jonathan,

I forgot what year your bus is but you can buy a replacement battery tray
(and maybe a lower, right-side rear corner piece, if it needs it).  I bought
these two pieces for my '79 Bus from Rocky Mountain Motor Works (The Bus
Stop). Other places carry them as well.  They're not extremely pricey.
You'll have to gas weld them in place, which screws up your paint job back
there.  I think a good, solid bus body with a little primer looks better
than a bus with an otherwise good paint job but some bad rust holes.

Concerning the water leaks: Beats the hell outta me.  Are all your engine
compartment rubber seals in good shape?  That's really important for proper
engine cooling.

Just my $20 worth.

Cheese
