&gt;I have heard that sanding down pads is a no-no...

I was told to do this for my last bus because of the hard pedal.  He told
me it was due to glazing on the shoes/drums.  I used 60 grit paper on them,
and the brakes worked MUCH better afterwards. 

The guy who told me this I consider to be a bus guru.  He has his own 
VW shop (Guenter and Harry, Sacramento) and is doing quite well at it.
