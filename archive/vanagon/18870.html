So, I'm driving down the street when I see this old flat-faced Van, of
American marquee (I know not which).  Then I notice that there are vents
towards the back of it.  Then I notice that it's a rear-engined beast and
sounds very much like an old Corvair (!).

What Gives?

Part Two, from the Local Freak Department:  A guy with gravel, of all
different colors/shapes, in neat patterns, imbedded into his 1971 VWBug (!).
He sez:  &quot;I plan to turn the interior (i.e., the back seat) into a
terrarium (!).&quot;
