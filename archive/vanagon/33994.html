To All:

They pry off.  And drive on, using a piece of exhaust pipe tubing.  No dents.
 You'll need a specially bent tool, like a brake adjusting tool or a
beekeeper's hive tool (one of the must useful scrapers ever made).  Whatever
tool you use, use the cast bosses on the brake drum as fulcrums.  The cap
will pop right off, even when heavily rusted.

============
I have successfully used a large pair of arc joint pliers.  I grab the rim of
the cap that bottoms against the brake drum and pull/rock the cap off.
