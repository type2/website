Subject:      searching for a van

today, foxhntr said,

&gt; I'm
&gt; here in northern Virginia and a big wanna-be.

and I live in central vermont and a wanna-be.

&gt;I'm talking to anybody I can,

and so i speak.

&gt;Could you help get my ad in newsletters and on the Van Net?

I will keep an eye out around here although, vermont raod crews  use
a lot of salt in the winter. tends to ruuuussssstttt.  a local
guy buys vans in southern auctions. this, however deletes the
trustworthy part of your add.  no service record from an auction.

&gt; The basic info...  Wanted- trustworthy '90 or so VW Syncro poptop Multivan or
&gt; Weekender (camper OK).  Body, mileage, mechanics, etc. OK for everyday plus
&gt; travel use.  I'm in northern Va. but will travel for bargain.

i know where a 87 synchro with motor and 4 wheel problems, $2500
depends on how deep your pockets go for repair, way to deep for
me,  all indications indicate that this van has problems, but so do i,
but its white and blue, i just sing blues, real bad the way they
should be, but i stray from the topic.

also i've seen a 90 or so synchro for roughly 17k i have seen in the
past month. any interest give me a yell, and i will locate zap
the telephone number.

details on either elude me at the moment since i was pretty weary of
one and to poor for the other.

&gt; Thanks for any help or suggestions,

I would like to find a vw van mid to late 70's, looking for
a solid body and drivable home to vermont where repairs could begin,
sound kinda risky i know, but is life without some risk. mainly
looking for a solid body which sends me to the southern regions.  any
help with resources would be great.

thank you to all on the list ahead of time, very nice vw resource,
i've really appreciated the information i have recieved so far.
