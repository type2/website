Subject: RE: engine compartment seals

&gt;From: KIPARSKI_at_delphi_dot_com

&gt; Where can one buy engine compartment seals for the Bus?  I would like to
&gt; seal my engine compartment in order to keep the cold half of my engine cold,
&gt; and the hot half isolated from the cold half.  Right now, it is only
&gt; half 'n half sealed  :-).
&gt; 
&gt; I have engine compartment seals for te Bug, perhaps it is possible to fit
&gt; these into my Bus?  How about using rubber from a tire inner tube to make
&gt; my own seals?   Someone suggested to me to use pieces of rubber made from
&gt; the heavy-duty rubber used for roofing.  Who has messed around with custom
&gt; engine compartment sealing?

Here's something that I did when I used to drive a '72 bus.  I used the 3 foot 
foam pipe insulation that you can get at a building supply houses.  (You can
get longer sections today.) It works well since you do not have to worry about
the gap sizes around the engine compartment and sheet metal.  It may be a
tight fit getting it it but once it's in it will stay in place.  The only
problem I had was that it may deform from the heat since the rear is so close
to the muffler.  Give that a try.  It's cheap enough.
