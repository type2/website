I have a TON of VW Vanagon stuff on my PC, and over time, I hope to send it
out to all fellow nuts. My question for now for you guys is, the Vanagon list
has been going on for a while now. Does anybody know where I can get a big
pile of past mail or past articles from somebody/place relating to vanagons?
I could easily spare about 30MB on my hard drive for tech info, junk,
articles, whatever.

That is...

Is there some kind of great Vanagon body of knowledge floating around in
Cyberspace awaiting the picking?
