Hmm, I don't think I'd go back to that garage.

Where I work (Penske Auto Center), we use air guns to put the lugs on, but
we have &quot;Torque Sticks.&quot;  These are color-coded attachments for the air
wrenches that limit the torque applied to a certain value.  There is a
booklet that comes with the Torque Sticks that tells you what color to use
for each model car.  

For instance, the &quot;gray&quot; stick torques to 100 ft-lbs for cars with 19mm lug
nuts.  The &quot;brown&quot; stick also torques to 100 ft-lbs but is used for cars
with 13/16&quot; lug nuts.  

They're pretty handy.  However, some of the small cars give us trouble in
that the lug nuts are so small, we don't have a torque stick to fit.  For
those, we use a torque wrench.

&gt; I have the lug nut  torque values written on the drums. It gives the
&gt; stoned grease monkeys a good laugh at Tired America as they wail on them
&gt; with the air wrench.The morale of the story is to double check them.It is
&gt; so bad I have had the Van roll out of their garage with the WRONG
&gt; TIRES!!!

&gt; &gt;       Here's technical tip #2:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       At the weekend VW show in E. Ohio we did a brake inspection
&gt; &gt;       on Vanagon rear brakes. It took us about 3 hours to get both
&gt; &gt;       rear drums off. The first problem was the lugs were on
&gt; &gt;       with about 1000 ft./lb's. (we bent my best 4 way wrench)
&gt; &gt;       Next problem was the brake drum center hole was good and 
&gt; &gt;       rusted to the axle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       The fix: grease!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       I found the the VW lugs are very precision fit. Over
&gt; &gt;       tightening along with rust is the problem. Grease on the 
&gt; &gt;       threads and using a torch wrench, will prevent further
&gt; &gt;       problems here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       As for the centering hole: sand this area and the axle
&gt; &gt;       with sandpaper to remove rust. Then coat the entire matting
&gt; &gt;       areas with grease. WARNING: WIPE IT OFF, Yes use a rag and
&gt; &gt;       wipe the grease off. This area requires rust protection 
&gt; &gt;       but any considerably amount of grease in this area will be 
&gt; &gt;       thrown out to the brake. So you must WIPE IT OFF, leaving
&gt; &gt;       only a very thin film of grease to prevent rust.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;       Now... Do you think the next time the corner mechinic
&gt; &gt;       has to check your brakes, he is going to take the time
&gt; &gt;       to do these things??? I bet he even has his air
&gt; &gt;       gun (wrench) turned up full when he puts on the lugs!
