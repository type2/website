Subject: propane stove '86 Westy

    
One burner control on my 86 Westy stove packed it in without warning while
on a camping trip last week. More specifically the one closest to the sink
will not turn to the left? so you can light it. The mechanism itself can be
depressed inwards but that is it. I've tried WD40 etc to lubricate it but no
luck. The info I have on this stove would seem to indicate I will have to
replace the entire burner unit....has anyone had a similar problem or any
idea how it can be fixed before I spring for big $$$
