&gt; &lt;&lt; We spent $6.00 washing every square inch of the inside of the van,

&gt;  the water to run out the open sliding door of the van. We paid particular
&gt;  attention to the window seals, the slider tracks for the door, and to the
&gt;  headliner, which I am proud to say, looks like brand new...
