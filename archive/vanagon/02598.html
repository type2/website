&gt;Has anyone else out there heard that westy's in the US are prone
&gt;to tipping to the left on left turns because of so much of the weight
&gt;of these things being on the left side of the van (kitchen, etc.)?
&gt;If so, does anyone have any brilliant idea about how to prevent
&gt;this potential?

I keep thinking of the Suzuki Samauri tests.  They had some long extentions
on the sides of the vehicle to test its tippiness.  They would catch the 'car'
so the passengers didn't get dumped out.  I'm sure you could adapt that to
the van, but those gadgets would stick out like a pair of wings!  Might
cause problems when parking or squeezing through traffic.  Maybe they could
be rigged to pop out if the van tipped at more than 20 degrees!  I wonder if
there's a patent on that...Too late now, eh?
