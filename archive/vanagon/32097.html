Hello Vanagoners -

I have two copies of VW's 'Introducing Eurovan' VHS videotape that I really
don't want.  The video is dated 1992 and is a hokey promotional thing that
will probably be of value to you collectors out there.

Fortunately for you (and you know who you are), I have no interest in
the EV.  I also used to hate the Vanagon when it first came out because
it was so un-Bus-like (I was raised on 'em, you see) , but after having
owned a '66 split, a '78 breadloaf and now an '85 Vanagon, I love 'em all 
and wave happy-frantically when I see them on the road.  But not EV's. Give 
me another 5 or so years.

So I have two (2) copies of this video that I got from my father-in-law 
(who thought I'd be pleased)  and I'll let them go for the low-low-price
of $0.00.  Be reasonable about the postage, though.  I'm willing to cover it
if it's within the US, but there are limits to my generosity... ;{)

And just to whet your appetite... I will most likely be forced to part
with my '85 Vanagon come June '96.  See my next post to this list for 
details.
