&gt; &gt;Let's suppose &quot;someone&quot; wanted to pack while on the Alaskan Hwy. Let's also
&gt; &gt;suppose that it's illegal to carry firearms into Canada.

No supposing about it...You gotta check them at the border.  It is
possible to bring hunting firearms into Canada under &quot;special&quot;
circumstances...ie. you are going to a Big Game ranch in Yellowknife
to hunt Caribou, etc.  However, you have to arrange all this ahead of
time and obtain advance permits from the &quot;Gov.&quot;  Handguns are only
going to piss-off a large Kodiak or Polar Bear...besides if [he/they]
are that close...you already have problems...just remember...don't
keep unsealed [remember their noses are logarithmically better than
yours] food in the van overnight....



&gt; Last time I was to Canada, handguns could NOT be brought in, but long guns
&gt; could be.  I suspect that concealed carry is outright prohibited, since the
&gt; Canadian govenment is more paranoid of citizens with firearms than Teddy
&gt; Kennedy and Charley Shumer combined.

[Read above]...Yes, and we also have less firearm related &quot;accidents&quot;
[domestic or otherwise] than our dear neighbours to the south...;)

&gt;  
&gt; I've got a compendium of US state and fed gun regs, but it doesn't cover
&gt; Canada. [They're still resisting annexation, but I bet we could get the
&gt; Quebecois to join if we hold off on the English First legislation and let
&gt; them have their own &quot;en francais&quot; state. ;) ]

I am not even gonna get into this one...

&gt; &gt;How does &quot;someone&quot; get the weapons (protectors of the ass) into Alaska?
&gt; 
&gt; Smuggling them through Canada is the WORST way to go.  In some areas, the
&gt; local gendarmes and magistrates can be REALLY nasty with scofflaws. (Even
&gt; worse than a Flatlander in a Cheesehead speedtrap.)  It could result in a
&gt; long-term stay as a guest of the Canadian government.  Also, to some LEO's
&gt; the combination of a VW van and a firearm screams &quot;free-lance pharmaceutical
&gt; distributor!&quot;  One could then expect a total disassembly of the vehicle to
&gt; search for contraband.

But, since we Canadians are renown for being &quot;polite&quot;, if you ask
nicely, the RCMP/GRC may port and polish the heads and perform a
complete rebuild for you ;-)


&gt; 
&gt; It might also be worthwhile, to ask what the Canadian reg's are on Bear
&gt; Repellant, a.k.a. pepper spray.  The large size canisters can be very
&gt; effective, even on non-Ursidae species. ;)

Regs are very tight on Pepper spray [read: need permit (supposedly)],
and Mace-type items are out [unless you are a cop of course].

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!
