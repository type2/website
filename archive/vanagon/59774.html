Subject: Re: Vanaru / Subagon XT6...

Check with Kennedy Engineered Products in Southern California.  I don't have
the address or phone # here in Thailand,  bu I have been talking to them
about a similar change.....

The only thing I remember about the 6,  was that there was not as much room
for it and that the 2.2L 4cyl was a better choice.

I think they are in Palmdale, CA or something like that.   They know quite a
bit about Vanagon Mods,  but have not much chance to play with the Syncro and
do not know all the misc. differences.

Good Luck...  I'll be watching to see if anyone has similar info on such a
switch.
