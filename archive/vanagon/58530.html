Subject: Re: Running syncro w/o driveshaft?

What about the feared, but no one wants to try it to find out thing with the
four tires needing to be of equal size and wear or your coupling winds up and
up untill it goes boing? If the drive shaft was not in, and the syncro was
driven, I suppose all tires would go around the same amounts anyway, but
could something get put out of sync?
