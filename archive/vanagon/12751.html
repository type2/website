&gt; &gt; y'all?  DO ya think it would even work?  I'm curious, and would like
&gt; &gt; some feedback before I start running amuck with wires and stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I suggested that was because the fridge basically just runs
&gt; on a heating element, and while it probably wouldn't get as hot on only
&gt; 6 volts, I figured it might work well enough to cool the fridge.  Some
&gt; one gonna back me up on this?  =)

Nope. I don't think it will work very well at all, since you are only 
generating 1/4 the heat of a 12 volt system.  (E^2/R). This won't get 
hot enough to drive the phase change system very well. What you need 
to do is change or modify the heating element to 1/4 the value of the 
present resistance.
