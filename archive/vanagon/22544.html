Subject: pitted intake valve
Date: Fri, 11 Aug 1995 13:05:50 -0500 (CDT)

The annual emissions inspection is coming up, so I had to do a tune-up
yesterday. I also replaced all the valve adjusting screws and nuts on the
'75 bus. This was prompted by the fact that #4 intake valve periodically
got tight and that clearance of the other valves kept changing, too,
although to a lesser degree. (Thanks go to Bob Hoover for pointing out
that it might have been time for new adjusters.)

After removing the old adjusting screw above valve 4I, I was able to
inspect the tip of the valve. Whereas the other valve tips had a smooth
surface, this one was pitted just like an old set of breaker points.

Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?

TIA,

Sami
