&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt;If you don't have the ignition timing scale (can't find my Haynes off hand
&gt;but in the Bentley manual I'm borrowing it is number 22 in figure 7-4 on
page
&gt;21 of chapter 5) on the fan housing a replacement was still available about
&gt;two years ago from VW.  I got mine from Capitol Imports in Columbus, Ohio
&gt;before I came up here in Jan 94.  It's black plastic instead of the original
&gt;painted metal but it makes getting TDC and getting timed a LOT easier.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps.

&gt;P.S.
&gt;
&gt;The canvas is the child cot that goes over the front seat.  Just not a very
&gt;big child.

I called Burnsville VW this morning and that part is still available.  It is
part number 021-119-249E and it costs $3.25.

Brad
