&gt; Mike Wright wants to know:

&gt; Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
&gt; plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
&gt; repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
&gt; white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
&gt; panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
&gt; be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.
&gt; 
&gt; My friends here (except one artist friend) think the idea is
&gt; indeed poor, but they also think I'm crazy to even have the VW's
&gt; Da Spouse has indicated a refusal to be seen 
&gt; anywhere near, much less in, such a vehicle.  Whaddaya think?
&gt; I'm still malleable on this one, so hammer away.
&gt; 
&gt; 
  When I got my '72 it was painted that baby-sh*t yellow/tan/orange color
  that VW had the good sense not to continue with. It is, however, almost
  the same color as is used on the top half of the crayola crayon boxes. We
  carried on with that theme and painted darkish green on the bottom half
  and, you know, it looked pretty cool when it was done. All that remained to
  do was to add the &quot;built in crayon sharpener&quot;......but we never got
  around to that.
