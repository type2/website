Subject: Battery placement in 69 bus

Does anyone know of any reason why I can't move my 
battery from the passenger side of my 69 bus to 
the drivers side engine compartment, other than 
the fact I will have to have longer cables? My 
battery tray area is completely gone, and I need 
to be able to drive it while I do the body work.

Anyone with experience in this area?

TIA
