Subject: What weight oil to use in 2.1L?

        I have a real basic question regarding what weight oil to use in my
1990 Westy.  Reviewed the owners manual and found that SAE 15W-50 and SAE
15W-40 were recommended for temperatures 10 degree F to 90 degree F, while
SAE 10W-30 and 10W-40 were recommended from 0=B0F to 60=B0F.   Just wonderin=
g
if most people on the list who live in climates with wide temperature
differences are switching the weights of their oil for different seasons or
what?  Also these 15W-50 and 15W-40 are pretty thick oils and I have never
had to use this weight in any vehicle I have every owned.  Welcome any
comments on this issue.
