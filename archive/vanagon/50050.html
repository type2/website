Subject: Re: Lurker Shamed into Coming Clean

Greetings, All!  I too am a lurker and have enjoyed most all of it.  I
confess to skipping some of the topics I have no interest in.

I too have a 78 Westie.  We got it new when my younger son was three months
old.  Our first long trip was to a friend's wedding and then we (husband, me,
two boys 3 and 3 months, plus the newlyweds and her son) went on their
honeymoon to Key West!!

I love this van!  My son adopted it three years ago when he moved to Seattle
and now he loves this van!!!  But-HA!-he's off on an expedition with NOLS
(National Outdoor Leadership School) for three months in the Wind River Range
and I have Kermit back.  Now my two golden retrievers, Porsche and Yoda have
lots o'room compared to the back of a Subaru SVX.

Should I let my son have his car back or should I run away in it with the
dogs?

Thanks, everyone for your contributions.  I probvably will be seeking a new
Westy in the future.
