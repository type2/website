Hi everyone,

Apparently West Coast Metric sent out cards to select individuals
entitling them --and only them-- to a 20% discount, if they place an order
before January 31st. If you received that card and have no use for it, and
IF it is transferable, then please let me know. Maybe we can arrange
something?... &lt;wink wink, nudge nudge ;) &gt;

Thanks,

Sami
