Subject: EV Resistor Update


I'm still waiting for a call-back from VWUS Customer Service &lt;grrrrrrr&gt;...

The new resistors should be in sometime today, so in the meantime I
decided to pop the old ones out before it got too hot today. If 
EVers run into an overheating problem which causes the A/C to
blow hot air either at idle or while driving slowly..the culprit
will be the fan resistors.

They are located behind the access panel below the left front headlight.
To get at them requires the popping up of the grille/radiator assy...
4 - 10mm bolts...and then the removal of 2 - 8mm sheet metal screws...
and voila! There they are! The resistors are held in by a spring
clip...total time for removal - 10 minutes.

Talk about FRIED!!!! the outside insullation is burnt off and the
wire coils are crisp!


I need to &quot;come clean&quot; on one issue with the manuals...I have been
able to obtain bits and pieces of the EV manual from the service
manager at my local dealer...unfortunately the parts I have
don't contain the info I need. So that really frustrates me..
not having the info...and not being able to get it...

I think what I might want to do, once I get access to a complete
set is to send the manuals from EV owner to EV owner to allow
you folks to photocopy them and then pass them along...
