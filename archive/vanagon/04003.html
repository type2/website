Subject: now i'll i need is a backing beeper..

just kidding.

	thanks for the tip on the reverse/engine kill problem.  it makes
sense since i had a day and half to install and test drive the engine (plus
brakes and everything else) before a 200+ mile road trip.  I was a little
pressed for time.
	as for mounting the type 1 in the 73 it was no problem at all..
i've done it twice now and i use (what i've always heard referred to
as) a &quot;universal case&quot;... i kept all the type1 shrouding and added my own
cut to fit to fill in the extra space (screws to the existing shrouding and
rubber bumpered to the bus frame).  i will warn you that cooling is not
as great when she sits and idles but i've never had a problem with city
driving and freeway.  You can do a little creative ducting if you want but
i prefer the simplest set up possible.
	Benefits from the type1 include easier to find parts (at least in
ohio), you can pluck the oil cooler shroud off with the engine still
attached (for when she spews oil all over the highway due to a faulty
gasket), and you can pop the cover and see all the parts/engine while your
driving down the road (provided you have a friend driving).. while it
may not seem like such a hot idea i had a wire that came loose
(electro-idle cutoff piece of crap) and just pushed it back on and life was
good.
	The only loss is that you have to do some creative lifting to get
the engine out from under the bus (too tall to just slide out). I usually
either pop the shroud and oil cooler first if it's going to be a major
engine check or you can tilt the engine on front (means front) and slide it
out carefully.
	
CHUCK
