Subject: Oil Drain plug oil temp sensor, WTB

Hi all,
I have a 1982 vanagon westy with a fairly new rebuild.  I am looking to
install an oil temp gauge.  Last week some one mentioned a VDO oil drain
plug sensor. This would eliminate drilling the sump plate for
installation.  Does anyone know much about these?   Where to Buy? How
well they work?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  With summer
coming on I want to see my temps instead of waiting for it to fry.  Any
other option also accepted.

I know when my last engine cooked.  It was a hot August day, about 105 F
here is SLC.  I was driving home from work and noticed a slight ticking
noise when I drove alongside the median dividers.  (you can hear more
when the sound bounces off the concrete barriers.  A week later the #3
valve seat decided to fall out.  Hummm.

I was searching the net the other eve looking for gauge info and happened
upon an ultra-light aviation newsgroup.  These guys were talking 600
degrees for cylinder head temp during climbing following takeoff.  1200
degrees for EGT.  I am glad my engine doesn't get that hot, or maybe it
does and ignorance is bliss for a short while.

Anyway any info appreciated, Count me in for 3 buckaroos also.  TIA
Ken Wyatt
82 westy
