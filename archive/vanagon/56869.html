&gt; On a hot day last summer the pressure relief valve on my AC dryer gave
&gt; out.  When it goes out it makes a startling noise and sight,
&gt; particularly when your standing right next to it.  I replaced the dryer
&gt; assembly and expansion valve with only one problem. The old dryer was
&gt; not marked as to the direction of flow of freon through the hoses.  The
&gt; new dryer will fit on in both direction. The van is a 1987 Wolfsburg
&gt; with 2.1? gas engine.  The one with the AC ducts that swing down and
&gt; smack you in the back on the head when you hit a good bump.
&gt;   1. Can someone please tell me the direction of flow for dryer
&gt; assembly?
&gt;   2. The goof I asked to check out the AC said that dryer pop off
&gt; valves  sometimes wear out.   I don't think I buy that one!  There
&gt; must         be an under lying cause for the pressure to build up.
&gt;   3. My vanagon has never indicated that it was hot.  But I have
&gt; noticed         that the cooling cycle is different than it used to be.  Now
&gt; the fan only runs for 15 sec at a time.  It may run several             times, but
&gt; for only 15 sec.        Is that a two stage system?
&gt; I guess it's off to the money suckers if I can not figure this one out.
