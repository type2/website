Someone found an old Front Wheel Drive Bread-loaf in Turkey. He
wrote an article to one of VW's periodicals years ago, but I don't
remember any details.

There were rumors  that the first syncros were breadloafs, and I once
glimpsed a picture or two. Finally, I have the evidence, a photo of a
factory
4x4 breadloaf crawling up a snowbank. Several prototypes were built,
including
two Westies.
