Ron, rvaness_at_neuron.uchc_dot_edu, Wondered (tm):

&gt;In all seriousness, I'm curious as to what modifications are made to
&gt;bring a van up to NATO specs and how bullet proof tires are designed.

When I was in the Army the Humvee's had, still have, what could be
called bullet proof tires.  They have 2 metal blocks, curved to fit the
rim, and stick out about 3&quot; - 4&quot; beyond the lip of the rims. The 2
pieces would bolt to the rim(2 piece rim) for removal of the tire.
According to the military specs the vehicle could be driven for up to
500km on flat tires on unpaved surfaces, and something like 200km on
paved surfaces, or maybe less, but what it amounts to, is that a flat
tire will not keep you stuck in the line of fire.  I would imagine that
there is something added to the tires to help dissipate the shock of a
bullet, and maybe even stop one up to a certain caliber, or impact
speed.  Other modifications would include a reinforced fuel tank, maybe
even some light armor plating under the engine and suspension parts for
protection from small mines. Heavy duty suspension for off road driving.
Low gearing for hill climbing/off road driving.  Probably also using
some type of shatter resistant glass or plexiglass.

Oh yeah don't forget the blackout driving lights.

Cheers,

David
