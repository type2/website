Subject: 914 engine

Hi,

My name is Jack Evans.  My brother forwarded your message about the 
engine to me.  I left one message with a pager #, and you tried to 
reach me twice, but you were gone before I could call back.

I have a 914, and the engine is tired --to say the least--.  Is your 
engine in good running condition, or would it require a rebuild?  
How many miles are on the engine?  Is there any damage?  Can you 
gaurantee the condition of the engine?

Anyway, please try to reach me again (706-737-2066(home) 
706-794-1919(pager)  or just return this e-mail).

Please get back to me.  I am very interested.

Thanks!
-Jack-
