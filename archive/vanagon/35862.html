&gt; &quot;Which VW model featured in the last video by Take That?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Well, none of us had seen the video (or heard/seen anything by Take
&gt; That I hasten to add), but we decided that it would probably
&gt; be something kewl, so we choose a split screen bus as having
&gt; a good a chance as anything.
&gt;
&gt; The answer, though, was &quot;Paula Hamilton&quot;! Uhhh?

Who's Paula Hamilton?

&gt; They didn't mean which VW model, they meant which (catwalk) model that has
&gt; appeared in a VW advert. Everyone else in the pub understood correctly,
&gt; which I think just shows my minds to one track when it comes to VWs.
&gt;
&gt; (BTW how many cylinders did the Paula Hamilton have? Was it aircooled :))

That'd be two jugs, I'm pretty sure. (gonna get SMOKED for that one!)
