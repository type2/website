Subject:      More Coolant Leaks/Tire Availability

My '85 has developed a very slow leak from the plastic fitting that
connects the upper and lower radiator hoses and mounts on the firewall of
the van (back of the engine compartments).  This fitting also contains the
knob for the bleeder valve that you open up to bleed the air bubbles while
the front bleed screw is open.  Does anyone have a part number for this so
I can compare my local dealer for prices with Camelback?  I'm sure the part
is going to cost some bucks and should be worth shopping around.

I have had Bridgestone RD-603's on order from Big 10 tires in Doraville, GA
for over three weeks now.  They don't seem to be coming in.  The price for
these is $81 a tire.  I've had really good luck with the last set and the
availablity of other options is shrinking it seems.  The set I have now has
45,000 miles on them and are just now showing wear bars.  Is anyone else
having any luck ordering tires, or difficulty finding these?
