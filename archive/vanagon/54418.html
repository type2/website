&gt;I have a set of Hella 500 driving lights mounted on my van.  These

&gt;the ass compared to the other H bulbs).  Anyway, I was wondering if when
&gt;these burn out I could safely replace the 55W H3 bulbs with 100W H3
&gt;bulbs or if this is a really bad idea.

The 55W halogen bulbs are the upper limit in Germany. But Hella offers
100W bulb for racing and rally purposes. If you like to have more you
may use 150W bulbs for air planes, they have same assembly. I can not
write if your plastic housing will be melted but I can check my Hella
catalog for which lights the 100W bulbs are offered. Please send me
the parts number of your lights.
