Subject: Vanagon Manuals

I have the bentley manuals and the microfiche and a UK VW repair manual that
isn't all that great and a Haynes manual for air cooled Vanagon. I have an
idiot manual (an old one) for the old breadloaf (pre 80) busses. Does anybody
know of a Vanagon manual that covers water cooled Vanagons which is not
published by Bentley? Is there an idiot manual for us. Is Bently and the
microfiche the only game in town?
