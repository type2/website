Subject: Re: Golf Syncro ? ? ?

Austin -

These &quot;Golf Syncro&quot; creatures were sold in Germany a few years back.  I
think I have a German brochure somewhere for a &quot;Golf Country&quot; or some
similar name.  They were supposed to be mechanical lemons and most Germans
I talked to at the time said they were very hastily designed and built with
little or no research &amp; design effort and it showed.

If you are really interested in learning more I could try to find the
brochure and send along either a fax or type in some of the pertinent info.

&gt;Driving around town today I came across an A2 bodied VW Golf Syncro - jacked
&gt;up ~ 6&quot; higher than normal, with  serious 'roo/brush bar assemblys front &amp;
&gt;rear, outside rear mounted spare, lotsa extra *big* lights front &amp; rear -
&gt;looked like it was all ready for Paris-Dakar !  Anybody have any info ? ?
&gt;(&amp; yes I know,where's the Vanagon thread; well, the word Syncro &amp; maybe the
&gt;fact that it's water-cooled ? ? ).
