Subject: RE: '85 Westy problems

Five days prior to a month long pilgrimage to snow country my 85 westy's
head gasket let go. I Have the replacement kit but am lacking in knowledge
and even more deficient in the wallet. Can anyone reccommend a mechanic
within 70 miles of where I live (AAA+) in Central NH right near the Maine
border, a small town callled wolfeboro, NH about 1 hour north of
Portsmouth, NH. Very bummed about this situation any help would greatly be
appreciated.

Michael Dower
