Subject:      bosch information

i recently got a copy of a Bosch catalog of gasoline and diesel injection
products. and, as i am wont to do at times, have started typing it in. :)

i've sent out the diesel and the eurovan stuff (cause it is smaller and
was easy to put in). i'm working on the 1991-1986 vanagons, 1985-1983
water-cooled vanagons, 1983-1980 air-cooled vanagons, and the 1979-1974
buses.  well, that's what it says anyway. i never heard of a 74 bus with
fuel injection, much less a 2.0 liter engine, but that's what the catalog
says.  ??

anyhoo, i hope to get those finished up over the weekend. just be patient.
:)
