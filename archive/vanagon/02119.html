&gt; Agree that if you set off on such a trip without a fan belt then you
&gt; deserve what happens to you - but if one of us brings a master cylinder,
&gt; and one a clutch master cylinder, one a slave cylinder and the like we
&gt; could accumulate these and make a breakdown almost as pleasurable as it 
&gt; can get!  You pay for what you use.  Being in the business world i was
&gt; envisioning getting a decent parts store to &quot;loan&quot; us some parts to take
&gt; around the country - if you get a mail order business my bet is you can
&gt; (one with golden tongue) talk them into this as advertising. Again whatever
&gt; you use you pay for. 

Hey, maybe we can get someone(s) to sponser us.  Maybe even VW.  But would
they want to?  Well, I presumed the trip was for all Type II's and not just
'bricks'.  If so, then maybe VW would.  Whadaya think?
