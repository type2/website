I am re-posting this because my ISP at home is screwing me around so I
canceled it. Please respond to this email address

1983 Vanagon L Westfalia
92,000 miles
Items recently replaced:
-tires
-front wheel bearings/seals
-ball joints (upper/lower)
-fuel injectors
-air flow meter
-KYB shocks all around
-upper control arms
-swaybar bushings
-brake shoes
-wheel cylinders
-clutch master and slave cylinders
-brake master cylinder
-catalytic converter
-water pump
Had the heads/gaskets done about 12,000 miles ago. Does not leak coolant
or burn oil. Just passed NJ inspection. Runs very strong and has
excellent pick-up. It does not grind any gears or slip out of gear.
The camping equipment is all present (front table too!) and in excellent
working condition. The fridge lights up on propane on the first try. 
Now for what it needs: cosmetic work! It has a few small dents that
could easily be massaged out by a backyard bodyman. The canvas was
patched by the PO with some green nylon. Quite unsightly but it does the
job. The interior is in good shape, seats are not ripped and cabinets
are not banged up. The interior panels are in the process of being
replaced.
I was planning on keeping this westy but I have the opportunity to
upgrade to an '87.  I would like to sell this one as soon as possible so
the price is very flexible. I am asking $2800.00. The van is located in
Flemington, NJ. Which is about an hour southwest of NYC.
