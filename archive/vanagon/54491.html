Subject: Re: Fridge/Pilot light viewfinder question

&gt;&gt; Pilot light viewfinder in fridge has been melted and patched with epoxy.
&gt;&gt; How would one know from there after if the fridge lights on gas?

Grab hold of the pilot light window 'viewfinder' gently with a pair of
pliers and twist/tug it out.  It's a plexiglass rod, about 2&quot; long. Make it
flat at both ends by rubbing on a sheet of FINE sandpaper while holding it
upright.  When happy take some Brasso/Silvo or maybe even toothpaste and
polish the ends up nice and clear.  Then stick it back in and goop carefully
in place.  Tim
