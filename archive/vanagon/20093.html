Subject: RE: THE DIRTY WORK

	It was I!
	Yes, I tried citrus based hand cleaner, Gunk and Simple Green
on the rear engine support for my '70 single cab- and a grungy, oily
thing it was too! Liberally slopped on and allowed to stand an hour
or more- then vigorously scrubbed with a $1.19 dish brush and
running water. Hand cleaner did far and away the best job. I had
been a confirmed GUNK user. But if you're going to use a scrub brush
anyway, use it to apply hand cleaner. Let it soak for a while, 
and maybe brush scrub at some point in the soak. I've used both
GOJO and Sta-Lube varieties of orange hand cleaner and both work.
For really gungy parts, the hand cleaner with pumice cuts the gunge
faster. Clean with running water!

	Bill
