Subject: General &quot;Feeling&quot; about Bus Boys

 Volks,

 The &quot;feeling&quot; is not good. Reading one of the messages which stated that
Bus Boys still owed someone $100 makes me ill. I believe that the person
being owed is from New Zealand thus making the effort of getting his money
back very limited and difficult. Although, the U.S. Post Office should be of
help regardless of the country of origin since I assume that the money
transaction was made through the U.S. Mail.

 Personally, I don't want the catalog anymore nor do business with a company
that really doesn't care about its present or future customers. I'm
wondering how many people in the different lists and newsgroups have
transactions with the above company. I figure there are a minimum of 1000
people between the lists and can't even imagine the amount that &quot;lurk&quot; in
both the lists and newsgroups.

 I just checked the June 1996 edition of DB&amp;HVW's and couldn't find an ad
for Bus Boys. Maybe I didn't see it or the ad is real little. Also, I didn't
see the company in the Advertiser's Index. Is this a premonition?

 If there is an e-mail address for Bus Boys I would like to have it. If and
when I get an address, I wouldn't mind compiling messages about bad
experiences with the said company and have them ready for Bus Boys. Of
course, the e-mail addresses from the messages would not be forwarded or
given to anyone. I just want the bad experiences and add them. But please,
don't send any messages now. If I don't get an e-mail address, it's not
worth the purpose.
