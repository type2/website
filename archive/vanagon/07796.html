Subject: Re: &quot;quick&quot; question on buying a '72

&gt;&gt;'72 Camper, 56K miles, parked since 1985 and definately a tow-home 
&gt;&gt;job, red squirrels gotten into it, known exhaust problems
&gt;&gt; but was running/being driven when parked, 
&gt;&gt;some perforation body rust ahead of rear wheels otherwise quite 
&gt;&gt;solid, totally oxidized paint, needs lots of TLC and fresh rubber 
&gt;&gt;parts.  Oh, its got AC (yuck) and a complete tent setup!  Is this 
&gt;&gt;worth $500?  What is it worth?  (this may be my Norton replacement, 
&gt;&gt;BUT no commitments yet)

Hey, Dan.  This sounds like a lot of work, and I wouldn't want to go
over $500, considering the condition, and as usual for me, I'd offer
less and see what happens.  The camper stuff may keep the selling price
pretty firm.
