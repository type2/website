Subject: Plea for unusual interior bit, Champagne 78

Dear all,

With the acquisition of my Champagne Edition 78's correct interior,
there is one small and Very Useful (tm) piece that's still not accounted
for.  Actually, the guy who sold me the interior had the piece, but
didn't want to part with it, since, as I mentioned, it is Very Useful.

The bit in question is an aluminum strip that screws to the cargo
floor along the bottom door rail and holds the edge of the carpet
down.

If you have one of these in good condition that you're not using
and are willing to part with it, PLEASE let me know.

Or, if you EVER see a Champ. Ed. bus sitting in a junkyard (distinct
two-tone paint, brown on the bottom, brick-reddish orange on the top),
PLEASE take a look and see if that aluminum strip is still present,
pull it off, and let me know how much you want for it!!!

I will also post this plea on Demented Dworkin's Used Bus Bits, so if
you find the part, but can't remember who asked for it, post here and
look there to track me down.

Finally, I'm sorta assuming that this part came ONLY on Champagne
Edition buses.  However, it might have been present on any package
that had carpet in the cargo area as standard equipment.  Would this
include any of the bay-window Westies?  Is there any chance this part
is more common than I think it is?

Thanks!
