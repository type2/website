Subject: NW Camping trip

&gt;As a new list member I see alot about our friends to the south doing the =
&gt;camping seen.  What about us in the northwest??  Its the only place I =
&gt;have ever been to that I can pull up to a stop light and see 3 other =
&gt;vanagons sitting with me! So why dont we start a little group up here??  =
&gt;If anybody wants to get together email me at mickeyd_at_iswnet_dot_com or post =
&gt;it on the list.  I do a lot of fishing, biking and white water rafting =
&gt;with my weekender and would like to meet fellow brick campers as well.=20
&gt;

I've tried in the past, but I'm not a good organizer of social events it seems.
Either that or that Scandinavian heritage remains dominant here. Or maybe
we're just all busy at different times. Whatever. But I do have a list of
several people who responded affirmatively in the past, and the days are
getting longer and warmer, and my wife's schedule doesn't conflict with
mine any longer, so maybe this would be a good time again!

As I recall, the main problem is that most people don't want to drive more
than a couple of hours - and since there's so much snow in the mtns that
restricts you to a few low-land parks.
My suggestions, in any order you like:
- Orcas Island: Moran State Park
- Whidbey Island: Deception Pass State Park
- Marrowstone Island: Fort Flagler
- Olympic National Park: Heart of the Hills
- Dungeness Spit Recreation Area
