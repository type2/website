&gt; In the meantime, since I was raring to go camping, I'm sort of
&gt; thinking it would be fun to do maybe a one nighter this weekend
&gt; somewhere locally near the bay area.  Any takers?

Ok, I'm game.  Put me down for one one nighter with Martha.  I will 
need more than a few days to get out there so maybe a raincheck would 
be in order.  I will bring flannel.  :)
