OK here is the situation I need immediate opinions, driving along
stop at a used car lot to look at a '84 GL, body in real nice shape,
no rust even in seams, interior complete a little dirty but OK, well
147,000 on the clock I'm walking away when guy comes up and says, take
her for a spin, a lot of van for $1000.

Well this sort of gets me interested, I was looking for driver for dad,
but hell my signing bonus at the new job is nearly $600, and a
waterpumper sure would be nice for winter (heat).  So here it is.

'84 1.9 Wasserboxer GL

Good
new rubber, Pirelli 205/70R14 44psi inflateable standard load, but nice
6 ply tread, probably worth $200 all by themselves.
new alternator
new battery (but small not correct)
origional Continental spare never used.
front end seemed tight enough, 1 ball joint leaking a bit of grease.
Windshield replaced 1991
O2 sensor replaced some time in its life
Seems to have had at least fair general maintainence during its life by
the look of it.

Bad
Auto (no experience here how is longetivity? seemed fine shifted
correctly)
engine? runs real strong but
coolant tank bone dry, upper tank full of green antifreeze
Exhaust system only OK
cranks pretty slow (could be battery)
Oil on dipstick smells of gas, no water though and the thing has been
sitting a little while

I saw no apparent corrosion or dripping from the head gaskets but
couldn't look too closely. recent work within a couple of years evident
on the coolant system though, some plastic pieces that join the big
tubes on the front left firewall replaced.  Still that tank bone dry.
Power was very good though, exhaust did not seem oily or watery.
If this was a stick based on the body condition I think I'd jump it for
a conversion of some sort (Chevy V6?) but unfortunately I don't figure
the auto is up to it.

The thing is this, I realy miss the old '86 I rolled, this might go
for as little as $600 or so, the lot owner took it as a bit of debt
repayment from a friend and has no real &quot;hard money&quot; in it.  I actually
believe this story for some reason, he said in fact he intended to
simply auction it this week, I was in fact the only person to enquire
about it.  I'm inclined to get it and risk a &quot;sanblast and JB weld&quot;
solution on the heads if needed for a couple of years of use, I mean
shit I figure I can part it for nearly what it might cost even if the
Wasserboxer is trash.  Any opinions, advice needed immediately, goes to
auction Wednesday (and he means it not just a sales ploy as I was
obviously not that desperate to buy it)  Generally aside for the damn
dry tank it ran and drove quite correctly with excellent power, far more
than th admittedly tiring '78 even with the auto box.
