Subject: Insurance Co.s/Org Crime

Responding to the question on Busgir'ls Thing list about auto insurace for
Fiberglass bodied Things...

The Ellis aka Rusty VanBondo family has just moved from one part of the
Phoenix, AZ metro valley to another. In doing so I reduced my usual bumper
to bumper commute through road warrior conditions from .75-1.5 hrs to 10-15
minutes. The milage was shaved from 25-30 miles to almost five miles each
way. The point is that the area that we moved from was &quot;out in the
country&quot;...   SIXTEEN years ago! 
 Since then everyone and their inbred brother has moved out and way beyond
the former digs. The traffic to and from the former residence was minimum 65
mph (freeway), 50 mph local and thick as Louisianna humidity in August.
Driving was nuts.  The insurance company still considers the area as
quasi-rural and gives a premium discounts accordingly.
The most recent residence is sorta close to the central part of Phoenix but
positioned in a moderate neighborhood when compared to Mansions and crack
houses. It fits neither.  

The point is that STATE FARM is raising my rates even though my wife and I
will be dramatically (with a capital D) reducing our driving distances
because we live &quot;in Phoenix.&quot;  They go by zip codes and crime reports etc.
Shorter commutes, clean drivng records, car alarms, secure garages, twelve
guages,Uzis and hungry rotweilers don't seem to matter that much to them.
The mortgage insurance increased three fold because the house we moved into
was built in 1948 (brick/solid house) vs the 1980 chicken wire and stucco
(pinata construction stlye)  house that we used to live in.  Both homes are
of eqivalent size. The response from the agent was close to the &quot;bite me&quot;
that I anticipated.  I add insurance companies to the list just under non VW
loving lawyers (CYA comment)  and tailgaters.  Shopping around and
communication with your Congress/Reps are the best (socially acceptible)
weapons.

The insurance industry needs an attitude ajustment. IMHO
