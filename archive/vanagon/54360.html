Subject: Sliding door on '90 popping open

For the last two mornings on the way to work, the sliding door on my '90
Camper has popped open.  In the past I've had a little trouble closing
it--if you don't give it just the right &quot;touch&quot; when you close it, the
back end doesn't seem to engage.  A little oil on the latch has alway
seemed to cure that, tho.  Its not popping open all the way, just the
back end pops out.  This morning I heard a faint &quot;thunk&quot; and then air
noise, and when I stopped at the office it was slightly open back
there.  Any suggestions on what to adjust, replace, etc.?

TIA,

Ian
