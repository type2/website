&gt;joel...According to, what Derek, and now I, calls LI's legendary Vanagon
&gt;mech, Dennis Haynes, he doesn't think its such a good idea to use the bosch
&gt;triple-pronged plugs in an engine not designed for them. He's had problems
&gt;with them in different cars.

huh. well ... ???    i'm not having any problems (that i know of) with them,
and it 'seems' to be running/idling a bit better. i'm coming up on a plug
change in a few hundred more miles and am planning on putting the old standard
champions back in. i'll see what the shape of the 3-prongers are, and whether
it 'seems' to be running/idling any worse/better/same/whatever.
