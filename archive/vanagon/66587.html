Hi Chris,

I'm no brain surgeon ;-),  but I would think that a 5-50 oil would give you
the best of both worlds.  Thin  viscosity when it is cold and thick when
it's hot.   Maybe I'm missing something!!

&gt; Several replies from the list have stated that 5-50 may be a bit high in
&gt; the viscosity range 9or is it low???). In other words the flowability
rate
&gt; is too high, and may cause the motor to react to the varying oil pressure
&gt; (???? I think I have this right ????). At any rate I think I am leaning
&gt; towards a 20/50 or 20/40. Bentley suggests a 20/50 or 20/40 in mineral
&gt; oils. Maybe someone knows if this is different running synth oils.
&gt;
&gt; As for the milage on my Westy, around 7k is correct, on the motor that
is.
&gt; I bought her about a month and a half ago and she had around 63k original
&gt; miles, and 6k on a new motor. I have since put on well over 1k.
Apparently,
&gt; the original owner blew the motor while not paying attention to the
&gt; flashing RED light on the dash (turns out she blew a radiator hose or
&gt; something)!!!
&gt;
&gt; Take it easy!

&gt; &gt;Chris,
&gt; &gt;You asked why I choose 5-50 synthetic oil, understand I'm not an expert
&gt; &gt;in anything (well...almost).  My understanding is that the synthetic
oils
&gt; &gt;have been engineered so well as to give excellent protection in the full
&gt; &gt;range, something the mineral oils cannot do. So you have cold start
&gt; &gt;capability and protection at any temp. I'm sure one of our many well
&gt; &gt;educated list members can give a better explanation and I would like to
&gt; &gt;have it laid out in better detail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now I'm not trying to be a smart-ass, but do you really have only seven
&gt; &gt;thousand miles on your Westy? Please don't be offended if it was a
&gt; &gt;mistake, I understand. I make mistakes also. Many of you may remember
the
&gt; &gt;&quot;bear hand&quot; ordeal I caused!!  : )  : )
