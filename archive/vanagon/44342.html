well you luckily have a 73 version with the german V4 
I was working on the new model for introduction in 69. the early ones had the
1600 cc in-line 4 with the crossflow head. This had a particularly bad
secondary harmonic out of balance and I believe that the V4 had a harmonic
balancer.

To get the car to market they changed the engine mount location and spllit
the drive shaft. the super heavy duty sound deadener did not get to market as
it did not do the job.

I still remember being in the back seat with a Bang &amp; Olaffsen sound meter as
we decellerated down the Boeham Wodd Runway with my ears hurting at 60 MPH.
It was a perfect example of a highly tuned lowlydamped cavity. Boreham wood
was a WWII fighter airfield that was bought by Ford for competetion &amp; vehicle
development.
If I misspelt it it was called NVH.

have fun sam
