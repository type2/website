I DISAGREE Joel, you are completely WRONG!!!

First one sniggling little point, according to the UMass Dartmouth Department
of Redundancy Department:  Ph.D. degrees is a redundant statement.

Second. J.D. degrees (redundant) or Law Degrees for the uninitiated are
given ONLY to the most &quot;tenacious and obnoxious of spirit and manner&quot;

Please correct this impression on any further discussion of the point!

Very truly yours.
