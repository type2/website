Subject: Window tinting

&gt;#4 - Also, a while back I asked about tinting Vanagon windows.  Well
&gt;I've done my research and am having it done this weekend.  I like
&gt;a survey for which is best way to go.
&gt;I've seen lots a vans with windows tinted but two ways really (I
&gt;think) look good:
&gt;a. a darker tint (75% grey) all windows except driver side and
&gt;   passenger side.  i.e. everything behind doors.
&gt;b. a medium tint  (60% grey) all windows.
&gt;

I have a second question: Is there more than one tinting process?  I've
seen some really bad looking jobs that appear to be stick-on and full of
air bubbles.  Personally I'd rather wear shades.
