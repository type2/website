James,

It would be worth checking the injector pump timing and the cold start
control to trouble shoot the missing when cold.  The miss can be a sign of
retarded injector timing.  If the injectors have more than 90,000 miles
on them, I would pull them and have a diesel injection shop check them
out.  The smoke could be caused by worn injectors.

&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; What would cause an 83 diesel vanagon to start stalling?
&gt; 
&gt; When I first start the van up it runs great.  I pull out ant drive 100 
&gt; yards to a stop sign.  As I hit the breaks it begins to sputter then 
&gt; stalls.  I have to then crank it over longer than usual to git it to 
&gt; run.  I noticed a little bit of white smoke right after restart up.  It 
&gt; runs fine after this and does not stall until it sits for the night.  
&gt; This has happened maybe 4 times in the last month.  It seems as if it is 
&gt; running out of fuel when it stalls.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have noticed more haze/light-dark smoke during acceleration and 
&gt; normal driving.  It has never billowed smoke.  I first noticed the smoke 
&gt; at night as a car was tailgating me on the highway.  Looked hazy in the 
&gt; guys headlights. 
&gt; 
&gt; any answers --suggestions?
