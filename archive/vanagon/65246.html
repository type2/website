Try going back under to your sending unit and pulling it out.  When it is
out take the rod and bend it DOWN.  How much, it's hard to say.  But with a
little trial and error you can make your empty mark were ever you want it.
I have not done this with the Vanagon but my 82 Chevy pick-up had the same
problem and it worked great, I set it up to the Empty line on the gage had
2-3 gal. left.
Looking through my Bently it looks like this would work just as well.
