Subject: Re: G60 in a Vanagon

Good point...

This makes me wonder:  how do they de-tune these engines at the factory?
is it like a different personality module in the brain?  If so, it is
conceivable that VW has a higher low-end torque, less HP type &quot;brain&quot;
for the G60 engine.

&gt;I guess what I am getting at is that the parameters that a Transporter 
&gt;operates (lower speed, high weight carrying ability) are different from, say 
&gt;a GTI or Corrado (high speed, low weight carrying ability), therefore the 
&gt;engine requirements are different. You will be sorely disapointed in putting 
&gt;a G60 or even a 16v engine in a Vanagon...it will not have any &quot;off the 
&gt;line&quot; power...and then at the upper end, the HP will be useless because the 
&gt;frontal area of the van will prevent the same high speeds that the engine 
&gt;can deliver in the sedan.
