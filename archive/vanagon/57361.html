On my FAQ, the following tires are recommended:

Vanagon normal usage:=20
    =95 Michelin MXT 205/70 R14
    =95 Michelin LTX 195/75 14
    =95 Uniroyal Laredos 195/70 R14
    =95 Yohohama Y370 LT 195 75/R14
      (Several list members recommend this tire, inflated to 45 psi
       front and 53 psi rear. Harry Yates writes &quot;It almost seems
       that Yokohama made this tire exclusively for the Vanagon ...
       they are that good!&quot;)

Vanagon off-road (Syncro) usage:=20
    =95 BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain T/A 27 X 8.50 R14 LT
    =95 Michelin LTX 195/75 14

Eurovan all-weather usage:=20
    =95 Bridgestone Blizzaks
    =95 Nokia's Hakkaapelitta No. 10
