Subject:       [F]riday Blizzard Stories...

Well winter finally arrived in Utah, and along with it arrived the 
week of crazy drivers from hell!

The normal 50min trip to school took 3 Hours the other morning.  
Semi's upside down, cars parked in the middle lane of the freeway, 
etc.!

Anyhow, not that this is going to have a point to it, but I was 
vindicated as I whipped around Mr. Bad Boy BMW M5 that was stuck.
Should have got an Audi S4! :-P

Anyhow, at a particularly bad hill, I drove up without even thinking 
twice (I was in my Legacy), and so did a Syncro!  (I don't know if 
the over-bloated mid-80's Oldsmobile _EVER_ made it!)

Some other VW content?

Well I hate to even talk about it, but my good friend was in his 
newly restored '66 Kombi on his way to work, and got rear-ended by 
Mom in Suburban.  He said it isn't too bad, but it's going to need 
quite a bit of work to straighten out...  &lt;cry!&gt;
