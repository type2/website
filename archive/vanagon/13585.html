&gt;How many women in business suits wanted to get in to my 72 bus? You know
&gt;what I am talking about. As they get in they look down to see if their dress
&gt;is going to swipe against some grease in the doorjam.

Me, I don't want women in business suits in my bus - I want B5's from
the beach getting in my bus!  Hence the Westy Bed and Fridge in the back...

I wonder what a B52 is then...
