Subject: The big head job

Hey now,
        Spent about 9 hours today on my knees, crawling around my engine on
the ground. Got a lot done, too. Here's the gig: Thanks to Bob's hand
holding post of yesterday, I calculated compression on my new heads. Got
the syringe from the vet, they gave me a 60cc syringe (look ma, no
marble!!) for free!! Ran all the numbers, and it came out to a 7.6 (rounded
up) and I decided that was close enough for me as I had no ride to the
parts store. Besides, I religiously run Chevron 93 octane, and don't plan
on going to PEMEX. While the engine was out, I replaced the fuel line
coming from the tank and going to the metal tube through the tin. Bolted
the heads on per Bentley, nothing to it.

        Then, I cleaned everything. Did I mention that I cleaned
everything? Used gas as a solvent, so I guess my kids will be green, if I
ever have any. Got it all beautiful, even the heater boxes! Been running
J-Tubes since last fall, as my boxes were in need of help. Cleaned 'em up
real good, hit 'em with anit-rust paint, and cut the ends off and put on
the little extender dealies they sell for about $5. Inspected the clutch,
still looks good.

        New rubber seals! Very cool, I don't think my baby's had new rubber
in the engine compartment since 1970. Got the engine seals and the engine
door seals, all in and looking pretty. Hopefully make her run a wee bit
cooler. Speaking of cooler, I also soaked and cleaned the oil cooler. Cash
was a bit of a problem, so I had to pass on the doghouse cooler, that'll
have to come whenever I do a full rebuild. With all the grime gone, she
should run a bit cooler anyway. The new pushrod tubes should help with
cooling as well. The hot weather here in Austin is what has me so uptight
about cool, I need all the help I can get. It's not hot yet, but it will
be!

        So, on tomorrows agenda: Put the engine in the bus (engine tin
paint is drying overnight). Valve adjustment. Bumper and rear skirt back
on. Gas in the tank, and a run to whereever I want to go! Fahrvergn=FCgen!

Peace,
