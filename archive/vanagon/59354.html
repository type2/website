Halon is still available but I believe only for refilling existing systems.
I don't think there is another product currently on available that is able
to extinguish a fire without the mess like halon can. It is the perfect
extinguishing agent for computer rooms and the like. 
&gt;I believe halon is off the top ten list now.
