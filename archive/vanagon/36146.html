&gt;Hello all
&gt;
&gt;I going to make an offer on a 1986 Vanagon GL. It needs some work but what 
&gt;concerns me alittle is the owner says that when the tank is full he can
smell
&gt;
&gt;gas. When the tank gets off of full it goes away.  He said that there was a 
&gt;&quot;T&quot; fitting on top of the tank that needs repalcing. I am going through the 
&gt;Bently book right now to see what I can see.  Any one have any Ideas on
&gt;this??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;

There are  two tee fittings up there. They like to break.  Have to drop tank
or have very small hands and long arms.  Not a fun job.  Also make sure
harness and dirt not touching tank.  That combo wears through the tank from
vibration.
