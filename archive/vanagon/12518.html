Subject: Carb Overhaul Tip


	I recently overhauled the carb in my '69 Beetle, and am quite 
pleased with the results. The idle and mixture adjustments work now, 
and it's not leaking gas from the several places it used to leak from.

	I'd like to pass along something which I found quite useful:

	Every set of instructions written for overhauling carburetors 
tells you to blow out the jets and the passages in the carb body with 
compressed air. I don't have an air compressor- so what to do?

	Go to a camera store, and buy one of the little cans of 
compressed gas that they sell for dusting off camera lenses, mirrors, 
etc. They aren't cheap- about four bucks around here- but they come 
with a little plastic nozzle which is *perfect* for blowing out all of 
the drillings and passages in your carburetor. The can I bought had 
enough gas to overhaul my carb and a spare carb I have.

	CAUTION- wear some eye protection when using compressed air! 
Even if you rinse your parts really well after soaking 'em in carb 
cleaner you wouldn't want to risk blowing carb cleaner or other junk 
into your eyes. Be careful!

	Hope this helps someone!
