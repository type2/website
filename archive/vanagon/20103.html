Subject: RE: /f Road hazards (CRANES)

This incident was in the new here recently:

In Austin there is a point where the Interstate (I35) splits into an upper
deck and a lower deck. One day some guy decided he was going to jump off a
bridge over the lower deck(14 ft tops).  The police had stopped all traffic
on the lower deck, eliminating the chance that he would kill himself under a
car, yet he still was going to jump. It was only 14 feet, go figure.  On the
same day in Georgetown Tx, 35 miles north of Austin, a tractor trailer towing
a crane on the trailer went under a bridge that was 6&quot; too low for the arm
of the crane, which was facing forward, to go under.  Fortunately there were
no cars on the bridge, as the entire section over northbound 35 was destroyed,
but there were a couple of cars that were crushed by the trailer, don't know
what the casualties were.  That will teach you to drive too close to a
tractor trailer

&gt;All the recent threads re: flammable substances, exploding batteries and
&gt;other general stupidity made me think that others on the list have
&gt;encountered other interesting road hazards. Anyone care to share?

&gt;A lady that I work with and I were discussing why I don't park the Vanagon
Westy in the parking garage with the seven foot clearence and the uneven
concrete with the hanging water pipes etc. Her story was that her son has
been a truck driver for years. She told of a time that he used a concrete
over pass to peel a load of new fork lifts off the back of his flat bed 18
wheeler at 65mph+. Jeesh!, If I were the traffic behind him at that point
I'd wish that a deer had jumped out in front of me instead! I've been the
deer route and can't imagine the scene. BTW: no injuries, just DOT driving
school for the trucker.
