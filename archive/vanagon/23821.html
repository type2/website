Subject: Re: KEP (was: Vanagon motor swap???)


&gt;I have a friend in Salt Lake City who, before his wife left with their '85
&gt;Vanagon Westfalia, had a Ford V6 engine installed in place of the
&gt;ridiculously under-powered diesel engine.  When the V6 was in perfect tune,
&gt;it ran well and had pretty much machismo.  But it got lousy gas mileage,
&gt;even on the highway.


Ever driven one of those Ford 2800 V-6's? It is the most gutless
engine (for its displacement) on the market, even when it was still
in the Ford. Was this the first of the &quot;smog&quot; motors? Depends on the
year, perhaps. But a few Fox-body Mustangs I've driven with
that engine... the four-cyl engine is actually quicker, and gets
better gas mileage. Now, the 2600 Ford V-6 that was in the '72 and '73
Capri, is a whole different animal-- it hauls!

OTOH, I've heard good things about the Buick 231 V-6, and one I
drove seemed pretty peppy. It was still in the Buick.

Other engines KEP makes adapters for, include the Pinto 4-cyl, the
Corvair air-cooled flat-6, the Mazda RX-7 rotary, and the Porsche
air-cooled flat-6 (triple the cost of your bus! :). Check them out--
their adapters sound interesting and workable (speaking as one who
has never put his money where his mouth is by actually TRYING one).

I'm not affiliated with KEP... yet.
