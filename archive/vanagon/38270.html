&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Bus season returns to Ottawa.
&gt;
&gt;I just dug my '66 out of the snow (twenty feet, 3 feet high) and managed to
&gt;nurse her to the location where I do my work on her.  She needs a thing or two.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, top of the list is a card rebuilt.  I've now got a rebuild kit and
&gt;am ready to start.  Almost.  I read a book that recommended soaking the carb 
&gt;for a while but didn't mention what solution to soak it in.
&gt;
Your FLAPS should have stuff specifically called carb. cleaner in  gallon or
1/2 gallon cans.  It's fairly non-environmentaly friendly, closer to paint
stripper than it is to gas or Gunk.  It should tell on the can how long to
soak it.  Make sure you remove all the plastic or rubber parts first.
