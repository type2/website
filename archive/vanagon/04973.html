Subject: Re: nicknames for the generations

&gt; anyhoo, i've been busying my widdle bwain about this (slow day at flat rock)
&gt; and the closest thing i can think of that resembles the eurovan (and vice
&gt; versa) is either a camping/hiking boot or baby shoes.
&gt; 
&gt; but if you call it 'das Boot', that means a boat, and usually a submarine.
&gt; 

Keeping with the nautical tradition how about &quot;You-Row&quot; van?

Jack
