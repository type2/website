&gt; I hate to let you know this, but when I took my pump apart under similar

I suppose a better word than freeze would have been &quot;sticks&quot;.  The 
bearings and wotnot dry out over the Winter and there's too much 
resistance in the lines to supply enough current to break things loose.  
This is a new motor and I've gotten no indications, either by water color 
or taste, that things are awry with the motor itself.  YMMV, tho.

Additionally, although you don't state it, it sounds like your pump 
failed altogether, rather than just needed the extra kick that the higher 
current from the cables supplied.  In which case you'd be right in your 
assessment.
