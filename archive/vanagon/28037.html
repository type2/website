 &gt; While rotating the tires on the '85, I found this metal thing in the bag
 &gt; with the jack.  It is marked &quot;10&quot; at one end &quot;13&quot; at the other.  Is this a
 &gt; wrench?  Or is it some kind of magic de-tighten und unloosen device from
 &gt; VW-GMbH?

Hey, what are you doing looking into bags while the tires are rotating!  Keep 
your eyes on the road!
