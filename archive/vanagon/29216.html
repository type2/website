&gt; About the &quot;almost&quot;: every couple of hours or so, the engine misses a
&gt; few
&gt; beats and &quot;bucks&quot; (is that a word?), as if the fuel injection went
&gt; on
&gt; strike. Actually stalled at a turnpike booth and had to push the bus
&gt; out
&gt; of the way. Wiggled the F.I. harness a bit and that always fixed the
&gt; problem for the next 100 miles. As an experiment, I wiggled the same
&gt; harness while the engine was running, and sure enough, it stalled.
&gt; Tonight, I removed the harness from the bus and made continuity
&gt; checks
&gt; with the ohm-meter; couldn't find anything wrong. Perhaps there was
&gt; a bad
&gt; contact at one of the multi-prong connectors (MPC?). 

I had similar symptoms in my '77 (Da Rust Bucket) that got as bad as you describe: 
mostly missing/lurching/bucking, and I also had it die on the freeway a couple of 
times, wouldn't restart, etc.  I convinced myself that the wiggling I was doing on 
various harness parts and relay connections was related to the cause of it, since a 
wiggle would &quot;cause&quot; the engine to miss, or it would restart afterwards, but I could 
never *quite* track it down.

What finally cured it completely, totally and instantaneously was a complete set of 
new, high-quality Bosch spark plug wires!  (I had even bought off-brand ones, and 
that *didn't* do the trick.)  So if your rebuild has not included new 1st class 
spark plug wires, give 'em a try!
