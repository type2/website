Subject: Re: mileage?  I'll give you mileage

How about &quot;66 Split to India and back over the most unbelievable roads and
25000 plus miles and an average return of 29.8 per gallon averaged over entire
trip?
Or &quot;67 thru Europe last year...40 plus to the gallon )but it was a brand new
engine which we were running in and nursing...!)
