&gt; 			I stand corrected.
&gt; &gt;               
&gt; &gt;Heads can be interchanged between 1800s and 2000s (1800 valves are bigger) but 
&gt; &gt;1700 heads only fit 1700s. 
&gt; 
&gt; Nope.  I took a set of heads from a 1700 in the junkyard and bolted them
&gt; right down on my 1800 engine.  I'm pretty sure they had not been flycut.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 			So, to make a displacement jump from a 1700 you have
&gt; &gt; to change everything but the case to get to two liters, and change barrels, 
&gt; &gt; pistons and heads to get to 1800 (the best of the bunch, in my opinion).
&gt; 
&gt; Again, you don't have to change heads to go from 1.7 to 1.8.  The most you
&gt; will have to do is have the heads flycut, but I don't think so.  I also
&gt; am almost positive that you can make a 1.8 into a 2-liter by using 2 liter
&gt; pistons, barrels, rods, and crank.  You can even cut down the old 1.8 liter
&gt; crank to a 2 liter one.  My source for this is &quot;How to rebuild your Air-
&gt; Cooled VW Engine&quot;, and numerous discussions with machine-shop guys.
&gt; 

My experience on this has been that 1700 heads don't fit on an 1800 engine.
Replacing one of the heads on my `74 (1.8) I was accidentally sold a 1.7l
head and it definitely didn't fit on the barrels of my bus; I tried it and it
was too small.  Now how's that for a descrepency in the data?  :)
