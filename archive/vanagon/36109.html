Subject: Mofoco Spring catalog arrives

Hi folks,

I just received Mofoco's spring catalog.  A few things I'll be buying soon 
are now at the lowest prices I've seen anywhere:

New Universal Brazilian Case  043-101-025D  $260
(that's $30-$40 less than their usual price)

Mahle 85.5mm cast pistion/barrel sets  on sale: $72
(down from $89.95)

The German Leistritz bug mufflers are still $45.

Just passing the info along--I don't own stock in 'em. : )

Their # is 1-800-553-8955
