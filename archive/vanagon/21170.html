Subject: EV Manuals...


After calling everyone I could think of at VWUS, I finally got in
touch with their Technical Service Department (as opposed
to their Customer Service Department). Their suggestion...have
the dealer order a set...

DUH! Sure I can do that...but why...ok...enough venting for now.

Here's my plan. I'll order the parts I don't already have. Once
or twice a week, I'll photocopy each section of the manual. Then
I'll send off the photocopy to a EV owner. 

What I envision is sort of a &quot;chain letter&quot;. I need a list of names
and smail addresses of EV owners on the list. I'll send the photocopy
of the manual section to the person at the top of the list who
will make a photocopy of the section, and then send it to the next
person on the list...and so on...and so on...I'll be on the bottom
of the list so that when the last person finishes making a copy the
master photocopy can be returned to me...

Ok? 

Let me know what you EVers think.

Ric
