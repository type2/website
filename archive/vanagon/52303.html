Subject: '97 T4 Campers

	Just got back from Bob Lewis VW in San Jose. They didn't
have a T4 camper, had just sold the last one, expected more this
week. Its got the VR6 and a 4 speed automatic. Asking price is $36K

They also have a '95 with 7K miles on it and its got a 5 speed- $29K. 

These are Winebago conversion but not the bloated thing built on
a single-cab chassis. 

	I got a brochure. The fine print at the bottom of the brochure 
states:

Call 1-800 DRIVE VW or http://www.vw_dot_com (C) 1996 Volkswagon of America Inc.
Printed in the USA U.S. Form No. W64T497US Always wear your seat belt,
extinguish all your campfires and never ever feed a grizzly bear by 
holding a pretzel rod in your mouth.

	:)
	Bill
