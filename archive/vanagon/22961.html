 I have the original distributor.  Various sources tell me that these
 distributors retard the #3 spark by 4 degrees to keep that cylinder from
 over-heating due to the warmer air it received from the non-dog-house
 oil cooler.  If I put on a dog-house cooler, should I get a new distributor
 that doesn't have #3 retarded?  I expect the engine would run smoother.(?)


 I've heard about the #3 retard too, but I think you may have the reasoning
 backwards. I don't think that the retard will keep it from overheating,
 but it will help prevent pre-ignition and detonation caused by the higher
 temperatures that #3 is likely to experience.


 Perhaps Dr. Hoover can advise us all to what is really going on with this.
 Does anyone know if the '71 and later distributors have #3 retarded?
