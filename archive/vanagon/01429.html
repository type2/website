Subject: Re: Front end sitting too high.

&gt;&gt; 	The front end on my 1977 Bus sits way too high. I've been
&gt;&gt; scanning through Muirs book, but have yet to run across the cause or
&gt;&gt; solution. A hint will earn you twelve Karma points :-).
&gt;
&gt; I would guess the back is low, rather than the front high. To fix it you'd
&gt;need to adjust or replace the rear torsion bars. It's probably not worth it.
&gt;
&gt; If you want a balanced look you could always lower the front. Best way seems
&gt;to be to get a sway-a-way front end which I understand changes the position
&gt;of the stops for the torsion bars.


This happened to my '73 and had me stumped for a while. There was no way I could
think of that the front end could get higher by itself, although that's how it
appeared because the back end didn't seem to be lower than other buses I looked 
at. This is what I think happened. The other bus's suspension had sagged with
age by an equal amount front and back but mine had only sagged at the back. 
Don't try lowering the front, it's a major job. Sway-a-ways don't fit the bus 
beam and the adjusters that do are both expensive and difficult to install. 
It's 
not such a complicated job to adjust the rear spring plates on the torsion bars 
but it can be hard work levering them off and getting them back on again.
