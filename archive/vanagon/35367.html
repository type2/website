Subject: Vanagon Auto's reliability.


Hi again all

Just to make you all sick, here in Perth Western Australia we are in the 
middle of a record hot spell of 14 days straight with Max daytime temp 
over 90 F and  more than half of that over 100F and yesterday was 110F.

Now that your all green, I had an email from a concerned VW'er and I 
quote;

&gt;From: Monsef &lt;monsef_at_ave_dot_net&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Just as a warning, I'd unload that thing quick.  The auto trannies are
&gt;expensive to rebuild and horribly underdesigned and therefore 
&gt;unreliable. Get the top-of-the-line AAA account if you keep it.  -eric

Is this advice sound? 

All advice eagerly accepted as I am just about to sell the beloved F100 
and I would hate to make a mistake.

Thanks.
