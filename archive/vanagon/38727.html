Subject: roller on bus door

        Just curious, but what are the tolerances supposed to be for
clearance between the top front roller on my sliding door (`70 bus) and the
rail in which it slides in?  When driving down the road it rattles pretty
hard when I hit a bump or whatever.  Is there supposed to be some kind of
bushing between the metal roller and the rail?  I'd say that there is about
1/8th of an inch on either side now.  I'm fairly sure that it would be safe
to say that it's well worn..
