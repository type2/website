Subject: Tar Removal Update

Tar Removal Update
I recently asked listmembers 'how do I remove tar from Westie carpet and dog
feet?'

The replies poured in suggesting everything from Goo Gone to hand grenades. 
Well I have good news and bad news: 

The Good News:  WD-40 works like a dream for removing tar from carpet.  (Thanks
to all who replied directly to me as I'm still off list).

The Bad News:  Murphy the dog is now tractionally challenged...

Kirk out
88 Westie 'Bart' and Murphy (a.k.a  'Slick') the BorderCollie

P.S.  No animals were harmed during tar removal or composition of this message
P.S.S.  I actually used Vegetable Oil on the dog's feet- I figured it would be
less caustic than WD-40.
