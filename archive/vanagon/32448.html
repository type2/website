Subject: Stovetop coffee makers

I have on of those blue enameled coffee makers, an old school one 
that has the metal pole and cup inside - I do believe they were 
called percolaters.  I use it for making coffee when camping in the 
bus (ingenious, I know.)  Anyways I find I can't get it to make a decent 
cup of coffee and I would really like to know why.  If anyone has had 
good experience with these things could you please e-mail me directly 
and share the wisdom regarding flame level, time, amount of grounds, 
etc.?

Thanks,

brian.

P.S. - I'll be less sarcastic when I get my first cup of proper 
strength coffee from the thing. ;-)
