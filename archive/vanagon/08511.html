&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Anyone on the list know how to go about getting Transporter or 
&gt; &gt;Transporter GL badges from Europe (or Mexico)?
&gt; 
&gt; Well I'd go down to the scrapyard and pick up a handfull off the ground :-) 
&gt; Seriously, there is a place near my parents house that has dozens of 
&gt; transporters, I'll have a look next time I'm up there and get as many as I 
&gt; can stuff in my pockets.

Andy:  Let me know what I can do to make shipping easier, funds 
etcetera.  Will send you my Vanagon GL badge, if you want it :-)
