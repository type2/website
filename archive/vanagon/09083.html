&gt;     And so, I'm lookin' for other ideas.  Anybody painted their bus
&gt;     anything but stock color?  Any interesting design suggestions?
&gt;     (This bus is far from stock with no chance of returning to stock so
&gt;     I'm not worried about keeping it the original color.  I also hope
&gt;     to get a chance to paint the '66 and that one I'll keep stock,
&gt;     Titian Red bottom, Beige Grey top.  And the paint on the '73 is
&gt;     still good (Orange).)
&gt; 
There's a split here in Seattle that's taxicab yellow, with checkers
down the sides/in the front &quot;V&quot;.
I've decided to paint my bus Smurf blue, a pale smurf blue (almost white,
like how they were originally painted.) and leave the bubble-top 
pure white. &quot;Mommy, mommy, there's a smurf driving down the road!&quot; :)

Are any/all of these stories/introductory messages/etc. being saved
anywhere other than digested in the archives? I think they might make
an interesting section at the vanagon ftp site. Joel? Gerry?
