&gt; -&gt;&gt;--Schlechtwegepaket
&gt; &quot;bad way packet&quot;  [no clue on that one!]

I think this would translate as &quot;off-road package&quot;.  I used a 
machine translation program to try to translate this little marketing
blurb, and the above was rendered &quot;bad-way-parcel&quot;. :-)
