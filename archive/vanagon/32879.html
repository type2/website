&gt; No way.  What do you key in on?

&gt; &quot;To&quot;  is you own name and email address and is the same for all
&gt; email received.

Yes way. I'm using Pegasus and never played with the filters until I 
saw the message about it here. If my mail is coming from the vanagon 
list, the TO field says &quot;multiple recipients blah blah&quot; and Pegasus 
filters it into its own folder perfectly.

Maybe it depends on the IP server that you are connected to? At any 
rate, I'm sure glad that it works for me.

Later. . . . . . Brad
