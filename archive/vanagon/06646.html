&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if anyone can tell me where to look for the numbers on my 
&gt; transaxle.  The vehicle is a '68 Westy but the previous owner said the 
&gt; tranny is not a '68.  Once I find the numbers, where can I look for the 
&gt; year?  The books that I have include chassis and engine numbers but not 
&gt; tranny numbers.
&gt;                                TIA

  I think what you should be looking for is letters. The Haynes manuals list
  transaxle codes for different models. I have both manuals that cover 
  breadloaf buses so if you send me what you find on your transaxle I'll look 
  it up for you.
