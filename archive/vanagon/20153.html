Subject: '56 bug for sale
Date: Mon, 3 Jul 1995 10:51:16 -0500 (CDT)

In this weekend's paper there was a '56 bug for sale.  Good condition 
or some such.  They wanted $4,500.  I have the paper at home and could
get the number and/or go look at it if anybody is interested.  This is
in Lincoln, Nebraska.  Jim
