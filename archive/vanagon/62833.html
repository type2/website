Hi Doc,

I bought mine from Autozone. Tell 'em any year Vanagon will work. 

Good luck!

&gt; Hi group: Not having a good week with the Vanagon.... someone decided 
&gt; they needed my gas cap more than I needed it.... Flaps have no listing 
&gt; for a replacement...... has anyone used any gas cap besides the factory 
&gt; one...... Thanks,   Doc
