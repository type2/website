Subject: Help!: Passing CA smog with a modified VW engine

Hi all,

I have a Beck Spyder (2-seat, mid-engine Porsche replica) with a
dual-carburated, 2180cc '71 Type 1 dual port engine. I moved to CA last
year, but haven't yet registered it here. I'm concerned about the visual
smog equipment inspection. I can pass the emissions test. It *was* once
registered in another state, so there goes $300 bucks. If anyone has
experience bringing vehicles with modified engines into CA, please suggest
options.

Specific options I have thought of include:

1. Remove 2180 engine and put in a pre-'66 stocker (which I don't yet have).

2. The above plus get a new certificate of origin from the manufacturer,
then register as a *new* vehicle thereby avoiding the immigrant extortion
FEE.

3. Bolt an original carb back on 2180 and pray for a visual pass even
though it has a few other frills.

4. Negotiate with the DMV inspector over the following interpretation of
the FEE: Since the fee is charged regardless of the fact that the car
passes emissions in non-stock form, the visual inspection is irrelevent as
long as emissions are acceptable. Seems to me the FEE is already a fine for
failing a VISUAL inspection for a little paper sticker saying the car is CA
emissions approved.

        Can the words &quot;Negotiate&quot; and &quot;DMV&quot; be used in the same sentence?

HELP!!! My '67 standard and I get along famously, but I need an
acceleration fix. Right now I own an incredibly expensive paper weight.

P.S. Matt Hendricks' '60 dual cab was way way cool. Six months of sanding
though... Congratulations Matt on your recent trophy grab.

Regards, Jim
