Subject: 1965 Engine door hinges


my 65' Westfalia needs to have the hinges replaced on the engine access
lid. does anyone have a spare set in working order?

I have a spare set of engine access hinges from a 73' Kombi that i was
thinking of using on my 65', does anyone know if the hinges are exactly the
same and will work? Just glancing at the hinges it doesn't look like they
changed much from 65 until 1975.

michael
