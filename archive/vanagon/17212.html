Subject: Re: oil drain plug repair

     &gt;&gt;i thought i'd relate a repair i just did... (Snip)

&gt;&gt;costs:
&gt;&gt;heli-coil kit for 14 mm X 1.5 mm  $77.00 comes with 6 inserts
&gt;&gt;9/16 drill bit $16
&gt;&gt;new drain plug $5

&gt;&gt;a couple comments-- the heli-coil comes about 1 inch long, the
&gt;&gt;casing is about 3/8&quot; thick so they need to be cut down.  this is
&gt;&gt;easily accomplished by snipping one coil at a time with a diagonal
&gt;&gt;side cutter.  when drilling out the casing and tapping it i was
&gt;&gt;paranoid about filings.  i stuck an air hose in the dip-stick tube
&gt;&gt;and had air flowing all the while i was drilling and tapping.  this
&gt;&gt;really kept the hole clean and the chips shot out of the hole as
&gt;&gt;they were released.  break off the heli-coil 'tang' not by punching
&gt;&gt;it like the instructions but just wiggle it back and forth with a
&gt;&gt;needle-nose-- it snaps right off and stays in the needle-nose.

I LOVE Heli-coils! That and Nylon tie straps. My only comment (even now that you
are done) is that one way to retrieve the metal chips is to liberally coat the
tap with thick grease, and the shavings get stuck to the tap. Works well, I even
use this method for the stripped spark plug threads so the shavings don't fall
in the cylinder.

After working as a marine mechanic for 7 years, one drills out plenty of
corroded bolts. In fact, I Helicoiled two 1/4-20 bolts in a water jacket last
night.
