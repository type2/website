Subject: New additions to my family!!

Hey now,
        Just found out last night that I'm an uncle! My sister had a 9lb8oz
girl on Thursday morning in Clovis, New Mexico!! I toast you all with my
beer.

        My other new addition? A '72 Super Beetle! Picking it up tonight
for $1200. Good strong car, minimal rust. I tried to find things wrong with
it, with the help of Muir, and couldn't find a single major thing. My
biggest complaints were: 009 dist w/34p4 carb (!!!), moderate deterioration
of rubber seals ( normal after 20 years), and wipers unoperational. All
minor stuff, the major components are all good, compression is 115 all
around-and it even has a universal case so's I can swap engines between our
bus and the bug. Ok, it's not a type 2, but we need a commuter car-the SO
drives 18 miles one way to work, 5 days a week. Kinda hard on the poor bus.
We'll be offloading our '78 Dodge Ramcharger (hardtop convertible) soon, If
y'all know any one that wants a piece of Detroit crap.

Peace,
