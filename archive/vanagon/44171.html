Subject: Rechargeable battery help

 I've got this Makita screw gun that has myriad uses around the shop.
My problem is these batteries take an &quot;elctronic set&quot; and won't work
any more. There is supposed to be a trick of shorting them out or hit-
ting them with a high charge to get them to work again. Anyone know
what the plan is?  TIA      west
