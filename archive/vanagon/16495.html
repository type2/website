Subject: Re: More New Owner questions

&gt;1) I looked at John Muir's book today, and it doesn't seem to cover 
water-cooled

&gt;   Is this book useful to the owner of a 1990 camper?  (The first thing I want
&gt;   to do is change to the Autobahn coolant.)
&gt;
The Bentley manual is the best Vanagon manual for doing repair work. It's 
not cheap, ($65-$85, depending where you get it). They are advertised in the 
VW mags.

&gt;3) What are the best floor mats?
&gt;
I bought some from JC Whitney and am very happy with the fit and quality. 
They were the Nylon Plush-cut Pile (p/n 78XT6127BF for $55) You can also get 
a rear runner which is 13x48 (p/n 78XT6733XF for $27) or you can buy the set 
(p/n 78XT6731AF for $80). These are advertised on page 13 of catalog 45J. 
You can call them at (312)431-6102. Colors available are black, brown, 
medium blue, dark blue, burgundy, medium gray, dark gray or medium tan. 

BTW, I have no connection to these guys. I just  like the mats (mine are 
medium blue).
