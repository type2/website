Woodrut: you said,

&gt;The Westy idled great for about a week after the adjustment.  Then, it returned
&gt;to the same sputtering without a lengthy warm up.  Thereafter, the problem got
&gt;worse.  It won't idle when it's too warm - unfortunately I had to discover this
&gt;in stop-n-go traffic on a crowded freeway full of anxiety prone weekenders.


I had a similar problem with my '78 van and it turned out to be an intermittent
head temperature sensor. At times the idle would be going up, down, and 
sideways. I put my voltmeter on the lead to the sensor, and the voltage was
changing with the idle speed. 

Rich.
