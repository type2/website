Subject: Tires for '76 Westy

The time has come
as it comes to all
when ya have to replace
at least two if
not all

I need recommendations for front tires for a '76 Westfalia, gotta
replace the &quot;cupped&quot; tires on there now so I can get the ok to
carry the baby seat (to say nothing of Mr. Beep) from my wife.
I'll happily spend $$$ for good tires. Please share good+bad experiences.

THANKS!!!
