&gt; &gt;&gt;Naw, you're thinking of Andrea Dorian, the lady with the picture in the
&gt; &gt;attic
&gt; &gt;&gt;that kept getting older.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;no, no, no ... the picture in the attic that kept getting older was
&gt; &gt;Dick Clark!!! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;you're thinking of Andreas Deloren, the guy that made that funny little car
&gt; &gt;out of stainless steel and Volvo parts. :)
&gt; &gt;

Wait a minute, I thought he was a pharmaceutical importer (cocaine).  Isn't that 
what he was busted for (or was it something boring like fraud or tax evasion)?
