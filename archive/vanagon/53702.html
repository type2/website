Subject: Re: Fuel Guage sender replacement

Funny, this was exactly the case with mine, too.  I guess that rear wheel wells
are not a great location for electrical connectors.  Mine just has a little
stub left on the sender -- I had to really work to get this apart, and broke
both the plug and socket.  At least the rear wheel well is easy to get to.

&gt; &gt; I have an 86 Syncro GL with a problem with the fuel guage, which my mechanic
&gt; &gt; says is a bad sender.  Has anyone had experience replacing the fuel guage sender
&gt; &gt; in a syncro Vanagon?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt;      NO but I was able to repair mine. The electrical connector was
&gt;      very coroded and making no connection. I simply cleaned it 
&gt;      well enough to solder new wires to what was left.
