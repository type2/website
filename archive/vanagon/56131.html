Subject: cv joint murder witnessed!!

i was at the vw dealer here in town today (dick dean in kirkwood for you
missourians) and saw a no-no on their lot, according to the owners manual
and muir.

they had some poor saps wasserboxer westi sitting there with the tranny
hanging off of the cv joints. No support whatsoever.  

i thought i read that this was sure to kill the cv joints within another
5-10k.  Are the manuals overstating the impact of this practice, or is
this dealer engaging in questionable/unintentional &quot;business creation&quot;
techniques?

take care,

stephen white
