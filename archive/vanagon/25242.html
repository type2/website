Subject: RE: Can you make the bus quiet?


&gt;After removing all the &quot;stuff&quot; out of my bus so I can begin restoration
&gt;I've noticed how noisy it is.  The engine sounds VERY LOUD.  The only
&gt;thing I have in the back is the folding bench seat and rear cushion.  I
&gt;removed the side cabinet(floor to ceiling) as I want this to be a passenger
&gt;vehicle.  The floor is rubber mat.  My headliner is good.  All the side
&gt;panels are intact. Are there any kits to soundproof the engine compartment?
&gt;What has worked for you?

The JCWhitney insulation, 1&quot; thick, made of two layers of acoustic foam
with a layer of vinyl in between, seems pretty good inside the engine
compartment. But it's coming off-- I didn't wait the 48 hours required
by the Home Depot-purchased contact cement I used to install it, before
exposing it to high heat (by driving it). Soon I will put in screws and
aluminum or wood slats inside to hold it on. That foam is expensive, tho...
around $45 for a 54&quot; x 34&quot; panel. I used two.

This made it quieter, but not quiet.

I have heard, that a lot of noise comes from metal body and engine-
compartment panels resonating with the vibrating/roaring engine,
in patterns that they have grown used to over the years. If this is
so (anybody care to guess, as I have?), then it might be damped by
spraying the inside of the panels with something like heavy foam or
underbody rustproofing spray. I haven't tried this, but sounds good
to me.

Carpeting on the floor, and maybe the walls, helps, too.
