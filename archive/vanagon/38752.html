Subject: Re: CV Circlip removal tool!??!

&gt;&gt;I rented a CV clamp tool from my FLAPS, but all I have managed to do is
&gt;&gt;Mangle one of the circlips.  Exactly how should i go about removing these
&gt;&gt;durned things?   Am I using the wrong tool?
&gt;
&gt;The correct tool is a pair of &quot;backwards&quot; pliers. When you squeeze them,
&gt;they open, and they have serrations on the outside instead of the inside of
&gt;the jaws. This is also the correct tool for putting the spacers on the
&gt;crankshaft. I have no idea where you get a pair of these pliers or I would
&gt;have some. ;)

        Sears. Craftsman. About $17 with tax (in Texas). Well worth the
cash, and handy to have around for other odd jobs, anything that you need
to pry open. Buy the bigger sized one, it works great on the CVs and makes
the job easier. The small one looks like it's perhaps too flimsy for those
big circlips.

Peace,
