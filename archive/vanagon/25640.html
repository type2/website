&gt;Public Citizen, in Washington DC, the group founded by Ralph Nader, is very

 Many

&gt;In Texas, it's called Texas Citizen Action, based in Austin and Ft. Worth.
&gt;They made a huge difference in the favor of consumers when Gov. Ann 
Richards
&gt;appointed the head of Texas Citizen Action to head the Texas Board of
&gt;Insurance.  Since newly-elected Gov. Shrub Bush has been in office, he's
&gt;appointed white males from the insurance industry to the Texas Board of
&gt;Insurance and fired the consumer advocate, resulting in much higher rates
&gt;for the general public.


Is this the first proven connection between genitalia, skin color, and
economics?
So the racists were right after all!   ;)
