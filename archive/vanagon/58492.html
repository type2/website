&gt;There seems to be some frustration on the lists about what tires are

&gt;
&gt;I contacted the Tire Rack and Max Jones forwarded the following recommended
tires for use on 
&gt;VW buses:


the 185R14 is a pretty dinky tire, no way will I use them. 195/75 and 205/70
give the same rolling diameter and offer a wider range of tire brands.
Ditto on the Contis, they sucked when on as OEMs. If that Bridgestone is the
one I was shown, it's like a transport truck tire, designed in the 70's for
Oldsmobilge Wagons etc. Worth checking on Goodyears too BTW, the Wrangler AT
6ply in 195/75 looks like an excellent snow tire, best treads I've seen in
that size. Also for those of you who want big sneakers for their Syncros,
the AT is avail in 27/8.5/14 6ply

the door sticker on my SYncro lists 185R, and 205/70 as 'stock' sizes on the
14&quot; steel rims. 195/75 fits nicely in between. These rims are same as any
loaf from '70-79 so all above sizes should suit loafs/vanagons. Why do we
keep coming back to this?  I think a mini FAQ is required, sent out upon
sign-up and/or every month.

bye, Tim
