&gt;ABS ain't all that good....

&gt;I remember in the newspaper there was an article on this.  The way they came 
&gt;to this conclusion was by comparing acident rates before and after 
&gt;ABS....there were no significant difference.  This may be the result of 
&gt;ineffective use of the ABS brakes, that is, people are not using them 
&gt;effectively.   

I second this. My insurance company (USAA) no longer offers discounts for ABS.
Their reason? &quot;There was no significant reduction in claims in cars with ABS.&quot; I
wonder when they'll start charging extra for people who have air bags in their
cars *and* children.
