&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cars themselves don't pollute.....but the generating plants
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that develop the power to re-charge these vehicles do!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;One source said that the amout of lead produced will far exceed that
&gt;&gt;&gt;produced before unleaded gas!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any reason to believe that source knows what it's talking about?
&gt;
&gt;I can't recall the exact publication and date, but its basically an
&gt;article on alternatives to gas fired vehicles.
&gt;
&gt;Basically it has to do with the amount of lead waste generated from the
&gt;manufacture, use, and disposal of lead-acid batteries...


I see. Sorry-- I thought it meant that there was more lead PUT INTO THE
AIR. But it sounds like he meant just produced in general... eventually
to be in batteries, or sitting around in junkyards (isn't most lead from
old batteries, recycled into new batteries?).
