Subject: Rainguards for Vanagons

Hello,

Before we head into the rainy season again, Is there any chrome or plastic
rainguards (those little chrome awnings that clip above the windows)
available that fit a 86 Vanagon driver &amp; passenger door windows.I tried JC
Whitney-No luck. The problem is the window is so wide, so I cant take
another type of guard and try it. Any VW parts or aftermarket catalog phone
numbers would be appreciated. Thank you again.
