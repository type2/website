&gt; I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both
&gt; thought it might be kind of fun to have a fall or even winter
&gt; gathering of west coasters from the list (anyone else who wants
&gt; to make the trip, welcome, too, of course!).  We both liked the
&gt; idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
&gt; even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
&gt; of Yosemite.  
How about something like this over here on the frigid East Coast?
Any takers?
