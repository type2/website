&gt;Help!  I've just located an 88 in cherry condition.  Only 43,000

&gt;full camper stuff...very clean.  The guy is asking $19,000.  High book
&gt;from what I can tell is $14,500.

&gt;Three questions:
&gt;What should I realistically have to pay for this beauty?

The guy is crazy if he thinks he will get that (Unless it's a syncro).  Low
miles doesn't mean it will be without trouble.  I think 10K is a more
reasonable number, but even that is probably more than the van is worth.  A
vehicle is worth what someone will pay for it, not what some book says.

&gt;All things being equal, is the auto trans any good?  Enough power?

Dunno, never had one.  People I know like them.

&gt;Any caveats?

Look for the condition of the exhaust system, and look for evidence of
cooling leaks.
