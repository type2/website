Subject: Re: Insulation for a vanagon ...

I am both anal retentive and verbose and I am working on a massive missive on
this subject of insulating automobiles, a topic I have focused quite a bit of
effort on over the years. I have never contemplated capturing all of my
lessons learned, and it is taking a while.
If next month you see the posting &quot;Re: Insulation for a Vanagon...&quot; don't be
suprised!
