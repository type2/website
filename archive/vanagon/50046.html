Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon Exhaust parts ? 



&gt;I have an 82' Vanagon (2.0L, aircld, feul-inj), non-California exhaust
&gt;system, for which I am seeking new/used replacement parts. Would anyone
&gt;have any leads on persons or parts shops from whom I could get (trade,
&gt;purchase, etc.) these parts ?
&gt;

If you are in an area that does not require state emissions inspections 
(yes, there are such areas; much of Pa falls into that category!), you can 
use a mid-70's (72-74, I think) one-piece aftermarket bus muffler on a 
Vanagon. It replaces everything from the heater boxes back, and only costs 
about $80 new, but does not have provision for a catylitic converter.
