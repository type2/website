Subject: Re: engine removal 71 bus

Steve,

The problem I have is not with the bolt turning, but not staying still 
'til I get the nut on. The clean thread trick didn't work for me last 
Sunday, hence the willing (?) volunteer lying under the bus. 

Anyway, next time I pull the engine I'll look for a solution before I 
have to call for volunteers.

My VW MAN, Ross, was saying that he had a tool he got from somewhere that 
had a magnet on it that stuck to the body and held the bolt in place from 
above the starter. 

Unfortunately, some time ago the magnetised tool went out of his workshop 
still stuck the the body of the last car he used it on.
