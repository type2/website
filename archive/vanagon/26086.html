Subject: cleaning carburator

Hi all,

I'm about to rebuild the carburator of my '73 bus and was wondering
what you guys recommend for a thorough cleaning. Specifically, I want
clear  all passages with compressed air, but can not do this with the
normal air hoses provided in gas stations (can not control the
direction and flow of the compressed air by just pressing valve with
the finger). Does there exist a nozzle out there to hook to these air
hoses and make it easier and more precise to direct the compressed air
into the small passages of the carburator? If not, any other ideas?

Thanks!
