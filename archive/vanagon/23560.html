Before starting recall Ric's favorite quote from about opinions...

I have an EV.  It is not very like a vanagon and less like a bus and even 
less like a microbus.  We could theoretically split into four (or five) 
lists.  Too many divisions.  I also subscribe to both VintagwVW and 
AICLDVW.  I get annoyed by so many cross posts.  Two bus lists would make 
it even worse.  I've also seen it that a cross posted article might get 
responded to on only one of the lists it is posted on.  Wouldn't you hate 
it if you only get one list, someone posts something that asks your 
question that you should have asked yourself, someone else responds but 
on the list you don't get - because it would be too many messages.  That 
would suck.

I had (or my family had) a '72 bus.  I can answer some questions even 
though I only have a water cooled.

Problem with divisions.  Is an aircooled vangon more like a water cooled 
vanagon or like a T2 bus with a type 4 engine?  Is a T2 bus with a type 4 
engine more like a T2 bus with a T1 engine or a vanagon with a type 4 
engine.  The '71 if I remember is a T2 with the type 1 engine.  Beetle 
engine solutions help it but not the '72 with the type 4 engine.

I like the current vanagon list.  It the 'feel' I like better than the 
other lists.  I'd hate to break it by trying to fix it.

of course pure opinion...
