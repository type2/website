One well was for tools, the other for a jack, I believe... was this 
discontinued in Vanagons?

&gt; that should say enough.  does anyone know what this compartment was 
&gt; originally for.  both of my 1960 bus's have them as well as every bus i 
&gt; have ever seen.  it looks like there could be a cover for it, but i have 
&gt; never seen one.  walk through's even have a smaller version.   any ideas 
&gt; as to it's origin?
