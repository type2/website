Subject: Re: Does everyones bus roll away?


&gt;My van has a bad habit of occasionally rolling away when I go inside
&gt;for dinner or WHY.  I wonder if this is a 'common' thing, or an
&gt;anomaly.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Sometimes the e-brake
&gt;works well, other times it feels like I am hitting the end of travel
&gt;on the handle and the brake isn't fully engaged.


Sounds like your E-brake cable(s) are hanging up on something
sometimes, and slipping off it at other times. Possibly a frayed
cable, that is ready to break?

Or maybe you have a sticky piston in a wheel cylinder? Or dirt in one
or more brake lines?
