Does this mean I have to move to ChiTown?
Or does having beard elsewhere count?

- Jeff, with beard
yep, the apparently obligatory Vanagon, an '80 Westi

&gt; When I went on the ChiTown road trip over the holidays I noticed that
&gt; most of the male vanagon drivers had beards. Is this a prerequisite for
&gt; owning a Vanagon in the Northern states or a neccesity...brrr.

I'm not even gonna ask if any of the female Vanagon drivers in 
ChiTown had beards, as you left that out, or if were they more 
prevalent as drivers of *other* vehicles.
