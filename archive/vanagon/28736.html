Subject: Ham radio


To All:

I'm hoping to join Tobin and his gang of Top of the World travelers on their
run to Inuvik.  To do so I'll need a vehicle that will survive the trip,
nearly 9,000 miles from my point of departure.  But even more important,
during the month-long trip I'll need to stay in touch with my home and the
Internet.

Given the Arctic's woeful lack of road-side telephones,  I plan to take along
a short-wave transciever and keep in touch via ham radio.  Ham radio works
fine for short messages that can be relayed via voice or Morse code and, in
theory, will even allow me to send digital messages that can be uploaded to
the internet.  But short-wave radio isn't like the telephone.  To be sure
your message gets through you need someone on the other end of the line,
someone you've worked with and with whom you have established a schedule of
contact times.

I've been looking for such a person without much luck.  They need to be a
licensed Amateur Radio Operator with at least a General Class ticket who is
comfortable with most modes of communication, including Morse Code.  They
would have to be available for the duration of the trip and be willing to
accept phone calls from relatives of the folks making the trip so they can
relay messages to us along the way.  I think you can see the value of such a
link, especially if the unforseen should occur either at home or en route.

Ideally, the state-side contact would be AMTOR/PACTOR capable and have access
to the Internet.  If they were, I could transmit progress reports back to the
Vanagon list so you can ride along with us.

If you know of someone who fills the bill, please pass the word.  I would
like to get to know them.
