Subject: Re: 12V Space Heaters?

&gt;I am interested in finding out about 12V space heaters for my van, 
&gt;preferably one with a low electrical draw.  Any info about this would be 
&gt;appreciated.

 Heater power = amps * volts

lessee now,   1500 watts would be good, at 12V that works out to.....

               121 amps, better get a BIG fuse for that installation.

The biggest ones I've seen advertised sucked down 80 amps, that's 960 Watts out.
Buy some long johns!   Or adapt a BN-4 or BA-6 gasheater. Plenty warm then.  Tim
