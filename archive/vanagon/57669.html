Subject: WBX Shocks

Hi all,

My '92 Wasserboxer now has 97,000 km (nearly 60,000m)on the clock and
since most of you listees seem to have far higher mileage than this,
I was wondering what experience you have with the life of the original
shock absorbers?
I've owned it from new so I don't have to worry about mistreatment or
neglect by a previous owner.
The shocks still seem fine at this stage and I'm not going to replace 
them untill necessary,but I'm wondering at about what kind of milage did
you guys notice they were on the way out or feel the need to replace?
The van is not decked out as a camper so it's not lugging around a lot
of gear all the time (it's the equivalent of what you call a multivan)
but it does get loaded up for regular surfing &amp; skiing trips.
Any experiences or opinions ?
