 Hi,

&gt; The problem with these engines (the 2.7) was the case was not really strong
&gt; enough to take the added horsies and the constant changes caused by heating up
&gt; and cooling down.  A common solution is a Dilovar stud kit, but that only goes
&gt; so far.  A 2.2 with webers is not a bad idea...

 Presumably detuning a 2.7 would help (providing it wasn't too far gone to
begin with, of course). I mean the 2.7 in &quot;developed&quot; trim will give over
200bhp, right? Which is probably...generous, lets say, for a bus.
 With smallish webers (a pair of triple chokes? three twins?) and a sympathetic
attitude to high revs it would presumably still produce enough power to be
interesting without cooking the engine.

&gt; The 78 and later motors are probably some of the best in the world.  There are
&gt; stories of people getting 300,000 to 400,000 miles on them.  I would put one

 The engine was redesigned for this, presumably, so I guess there are
compatibility issues between these and the earlier engines?

Cheers,
        W.
