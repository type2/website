&gt; Ok what have we got so far for LP On indicators: green LED's; Red LED's;

&gt; regardless of
&gt; colour that the LED glows faintly when first lit and then gets brighter
&gt; as the flame intensifies? (this is kind of interesting). The gauge may be

Yes I've noticed this, I think that the LED is hooked up in some way to a
thermocouple thing which is in the the region of the combustion chamber.

&gt; Also wrt LEDS, I took apart the panel and found the battery LED system is
&gt; hooked up to a potentiometer. The previous owner had noted that regardless
&gt; of the charge of the battery the green LED would never show; upon closer
&gt; inspection I was able to rotate the pot slowly so that at full charge a
&gt; green LED was possible. The key thing here would be to know a base point
&gt; at which full charge is present  and work from there - Hayne's gives
&gt; apretty good description of this. DC

Hey that sounds good. My full charge LED would only light up when engine
is running or immediately after engine shut-off but with no electrical
drain. As soon as you turn something on, no matter how &quot;small&quot;, the amber LED
would light. So I guess you could dial in your own cut-off point, say 13.5
Volts? Probably the group has definite views on where the cut-off point
should be.
