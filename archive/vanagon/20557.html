Subject: Muir, again&amp; again

yes, he kept our bugs/micros/typeIIIs running,  but more importantly, are
we really  that much happier  with fuel  injection &amp;  digital ash trays?  a
recent report in Car &amp; Driver  (Buick new car intro) advises that Buick is
looking into electronic key  fob activated  ignition switches,  as Buick
drivers &quot;have trouble turning the key&quot;.  let's  hope that this
&quot;innovation&quot;  doesn't  make it to Wolfsburg.......Muir would be
appalled.....
