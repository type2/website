Subject: Re: VW repairs shops directory

psm&gt; Since I am not extremely familiar in repairing/rebuilding VW
psm&gt; buses, I find it hard to evaluate the condition. I can only judge
psm&gt; them by their outward appearance. I have dealt with a VW shop
psm&gt; before with my '72 bug and they offer a complete pre-sale
psm&gt; check-out for about 50 bucks. This is all just

        Check out John Muir's &quot;how to keep your volkswagen alive&quot;. It has
an entire chapter dedicated to the process of finding a worthwhile
companion. BTW, the sub-title for the book is &quot;a manual of step-by-step
procedures for the compleat idiot&quot;, and it's true. You don't even have to
spell 'complete' to use this book effectively. ;-) Cost is around $20, if
you can't swing it hit the local library-I used thier copy for almost a
year before I finally bought my own.

Peace,
