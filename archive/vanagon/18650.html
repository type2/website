     &gt;Yes, the rear decklid window is what we're looking for--and they are 
     &gt;quite a bit different from the glass on kombis and micros. The deluxe

     &gt;the rear decklid of a 15-window will fit. Anyone?
     
     The rear glass you are looking for is a deluxe only option and is 
     wider and taller than that of the early kombi/micros. However it is 
     the same piece as fitted to the Brazilian Buses made up to 90's.
     
     I also recently read a story about a guy with a coachbuilt VW like a 
     Romstech or something and it had a one-off windscreen. Anyway this guy 
     look high and low for a replacement one (his was broken) and he ended 
     up getting an out-of-the-telephone-book windscreen replacement 
     specialist make him one for like around $100 - you know one of these 
     24hour windscreen repair companies.
     
     moral is that, the 23-window back glass is just a flat piece of 
     toughened auto glass which you should be able to get cut to size by a 
     local auto glass shop.
