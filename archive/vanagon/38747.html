Subject: RE: Border Patrol operation


&gt;I just heard on the news that the U.S. Border Patrol is buying up
&gt;hundreds of old Volkswagen busses in southern California and southern
&gt;Arizona to be used as stealth vehicles for patroling various backcountry
&gt;areas along the U.S.-Mexico border looking for drug smugglers.
&gt;
&gt;They quoted some guy named Vince Claypool, a USBP spokesperson as saying
&gt;that they were planning to put some sort of big 6-cylinder engine in 'em
&gt;and modify the suspension to handle better in high speed chases but that
&gt;the outside would be left as is.  Aparently, they are looking for busses
&gt;from the years 1968 to 1979 because of their resemblance to Mexican busses.
&gt;He said the high ground clearance of the busses is also a plus for this
&gt;operation (code named 'hipster').
&gt;
&gt;Hmm, I wonder how much they're paying for busses, I've been trying to
&gt;sell my '73 Westphalia.  And will they sell the busses back to the public
&gt;when the operation is done?
&gt;
&gt;Anybody else heard anything about this?


But seriously, folks...

If this is a joke, it's a pretty elaborate one. I heard this announcement
also, on both the morning news (ch.7) and on local (San Diego, AM1130)
radio. It's not a bad idea, really-- VWs have greater ground clearance than
jeeps, and obviously are great equipment-haulers (prisoner-haulers, too,
if it comes to that). VW buses have long been used as police vehicles in
many European countries. It's only their lack of power that has kept them
out of such service here.

There's a group here in San Diego that specializes in restoring just these
model years of buses. I contacted them several times to ask about some 
repair
work on the rust below the windshield of my '71, but they were always so
jammed with work they couldn't help out. Perhaps there's a connection here?

I'd be VERY interested to know how they intend to meet/get around CA smog
laws. Perhaps by registering them as off-road, non-highway vehicles only?
Works for dune buggies, and is even legal here. Anybody know any details?

As for the 6-cyl engine conversion, I know the list is waiting with baited
breath for my opinion on the subject... but I'll just keep it to myself.
