Subject: Clutch-related problems

Hello from a sad, off-the-list vanagoon.  During last Februarys deep freeze 
(here in Minnapolis), my master clutch cylinder and slave cylinder leaked. 
 I had the master rebuilt (according to the guy who did the work) and 
replaced the slave (a $90 part).  This week I had my vanagon towed to the 
dealer because I had no clutch.  Guess what? The dealer claims that master 
and slave cylinders leaked all the fluid, and they both need to be replaced. 
 My friendly VW dealer will gladly perform these services for about $650. 
 That's just out of the question.  Sadly, I'm wondering what my options are 
and why I'm in this same situation.  What's up with clutch cylinders in the 
winter?  I understood that old hydraulic fluid could have absorbed moisture, 
expanded in very cold weather, and caused last years problems.  But the 
fluid should be only a year old...  Please advise, I can't carpool much 
longer...  I'm off the list, so direct replies would be appreciated.  Thanks 
very much in advance.  Tim C. (tcasey_at_hdrinc_dot_com)
