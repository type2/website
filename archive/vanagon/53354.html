Subject: Re: What cruise control system should I buy/

&gt; What aftermarket cruise control systems have you 
&gt; installed in your vanagons?

The one that Sears sells.

&gt; Who did you buy it from?

Sears (see above) :)

&gt; What model?

I think they only sell one.

&gt; How well does it perform?

Just fine--even on my '82 AFC Camper.  The only two problems I've ever
had regarding the cruise weren't the cruise control's fault.  One
problem was the cruise disengaging every now and again.  That ended up
being the beginnings of a electical problem in the ignition (brain box
wiring).  The sudden change in ignition tempo when the engine missed
caused the cruise to disengage--safety feature.  The second is my own
fault.  If I set the speed too high, there isn't enough throttle left to
hold speed on hills (70+).  (I guess some guys want everything.)

&gt; Any recommendations?

If you buy this model, the controls go on a second stalk (supplied)
which I installed behind and slightly above the turn signal stalk.  The
controller box goes behind the dash; the servo (naturally) goes in the
engine compartment.  To boost servo performance, I added a vacuum
resivoir.  The resevoir is an old baby formula can (long and thin) with
a single hole in it.  Calk a fitting into this hole and tee it into your
servo's vacuum line.  With this mod, even my lowly air-cooled baby can
cruise for hours without dogging it too badly on hills.

Just more information to add noise to your decision . . .
