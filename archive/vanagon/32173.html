Subject: Syncro Tranny Died

Hi All,

Let me reintroduce myself.  I was a member of &quot;the list&quot; in 1994 before a
switched employers and lost my internet connection.  I'm back.

I own a '86 Syncro, 150K miles, good but tired engine, and unfortunately DEAD.
I live in Lansdale, PA (north of Phila 30 miles or so).

The tranny seems to be seized.  I was driving along (50 miles into a trip)
when I went to downshift, and I could not move the shifter at all.  I pulled
over and that was the last the vehicle moved.  Engine and clutch is fine, but
I cannot move the shifter and any amount of rpm and clutch slipping will not
move it, it just stalls.  When is was loaded onto a rollback the rear wheels
dragged, fronts rolled OK.

&gt;From checking the archives I've seen treads regarding the syncronizers (sp?).
Could these snap in a way to jam the tranny?  Anyone actually seize one up?  I
did not see fluid on the road and I've had no problems with leaks.  The tranny
has over the years made whining noises, especially in the lower gears.

Anyway from the archives it looks like I can:
a) see VW for a rebuilt unit  (won't happen too expensive for my budget!)
b) try to find a transmission shop who can rebuild
c) locate a used, relatively low mileage tranny
d) part my syncro out (not my favorite choice)

Anyone have a suggestion on the options?  Costs?  Availability of a used
tranny?  Did VWOA have some kind of warrenty program of syncro trannys?

Thanks in advance

Kerry
