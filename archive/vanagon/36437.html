&gt;I haven't looked closely at the Vanagon diesel starters, but if a 
&gt;Jetta one would fit, you may want to try it. My 85 Jetta is still on 
&gt;the original starter (and alternator, and tranny, and...) at 341K 
&gt;kms, with no signs of wearing out.

&gt;(mind you the starter's also about 8&quot; from the battery, vs 8 feet in 
&gt;the Vanagon...)

Not a chance.  I just did the starter in my Vanagon diesel four days ago.
It's significantly beefier than a gas starter, has a different bolt flange,
and doesn't have the nose cone that the gas engine starter that I've got has.

I had mine rebuilt for $119.00 with a five year warranty.  I was impressed
with the work, but only time will tell.  It cranks right up.  It was very
slow before I screwed it up (when it got stuck in the ON position), and 4
times out of 10 wouldn't crank at all.  I was prepared to do the relay
trick, but now I don't see the need.
