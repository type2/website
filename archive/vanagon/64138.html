Hi  I am new to the list.   I have an 80 Vanagon camper.  I need a new 
engine.  Is there any other engines that fit in an 80 vanagon? If a VR6 
doesn't work.  Just curious?

'will' it fit...'can' it fit...please James, MAKE it fit!! (I'll mail you
an oversize shoehorn).  If I had a VR6 sitting on the garage floor I
wouldn't be able to sleep!!! (the VanaGon's taking over my life?!).

&gt;I have &quot;aquired&quot; a VR6.  Does anyone know if it will fit in my '85?
