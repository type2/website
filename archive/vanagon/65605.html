Subject:      Re: Pre-Assistance

Even though there is a list of members available for assistance with =
Limbo there are probably a lot of list members here who are not a part =
of it.  It might be a good idea to have an additional list available.  =
If many people are interested, I will volunteer my time to organize the =
list and get it out to people.  I guess what I'll need is information =
similar to the Limbo list such as name, address, times to call, what =
level of service the list member can provide (i.e. from pointing a =
person in the right direction to full blown service and a place to =
stay). =20
If anyone is interested, please let me know.
