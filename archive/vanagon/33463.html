&gt;The bad news is, the CA DMV will stick you with a $300 fine for bringing
&gt;in a non-CA car. Two cars, two fines. They call it an Environmental Fee,
&gt;but it goes into the same General Fund as traffic tickets, which sounds
&gt;like a fine to me.
&gt;
&gt;I got this unpleasant surprise when I registered my three cars. Asked them
&gt;if we wouldn't all be better off if I were to spend $300 each on them to put
&gt;on the CA equipment and (theoretically) cut down their emissions. Got a
&gt;shrug and &quot;Sorry, that's what the law says&quot;. Hmmm.
&gt;

This reminds me of when I returned to California after nearly 10years in the Navy.  I
bought my car (then an 86 Chevy Nova) here in California back in late 85 new.)
California tags stayed on the car only a short while, since I was stationed back in
Virginia, I registered the car there when I returned to save money in registration
over the next couple years.)  A few years later, the car was yet again re-registered
in another state:  Illinois this time when I was stationed at the Grate Lakes Naval
Base.  Terminating my enlistment back in '83, and over 100,000 miles later, I
finially return home to the Bay Area permanently.  Immediately, DMV wants me to sign
the form for the $300 environmental impact fee.  I tell them &quot;wrong answer!  Look at
the emission tag under the hood!&quot;  The car has a &quot;CA&quot; designation on it.  This was
the first time I ever heard the DMV apologize for anything.  They simply said, &quot;We
just assumed....&quot;
  Happy news now though, I hope...  Just yesterday (Sunday) I traded in the tired old
Nova with over 130,000 miles on it for a near-perfect bright banana yellow '75 super
convertable.  Since this list dwells primarily with busses and vans, I won't
elaborate, but the 50 mile drive from the dealer that had this wonderful bug was one
of the most pleasant driving experiences I've had in a long time!  :)


&gt;Here you may be screwed. A car has to be a 1965 or older to duck the
&gt;smog inspections in California. If you can't find a liberal and ea$y-
&gt;to-influence smog inspector, then they will require you to put on all
&gt;the original equipment, etc., etc. '76 Cutlasses all had smog pump,
&gt;catalytic converters, special carbs, valves, a million vacuum hoses,
&gt;and God knows what else. That stuff is available if you look, but it's
&gt;not cheap, and it's a real pain to put on, not to mention killing
&gt;performance.
&gt;

My new bug is also a California car, and suprisingly, all the smog goodies that
clutter the engine compartment do not seem to adversly effect performance.  This car,
being my first air-cooled... does the fuel-injection add to the performance that the
smog equipment takes away?
