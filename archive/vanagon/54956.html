Subject: EuroVan Update



A while back someone started publishing the EuroVan Update. I got the first 
issue...basically there didn't seem to be anything more in it than what I 
either knew already or that had been discussed on here.

Anyway, does anyone out there still get the Update? And...has there been any 
&quot;interesting&quot; tid-bits lately?

Just Curious.
