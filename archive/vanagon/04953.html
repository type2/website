&gt; &gt;I'd rather not have to modify the seat mounts if at all possible.
&gt; 
&gt; i'm not 100 percent certain, but they sure LOOK like the same rails. but i
&gt; don't have anything to compare my vanagon with, so i can't be sure. best
&gt; way would be to go to a junkyard and check it out. cause i'm working from
&gt; memory here ... and my memory has been shown to be flakey at times. :)
&gt; at the very worst, you could get some later bread-loaf seats ... like from a
&gt; 1978 or 79. but that's not very much different from what you have on the 68.

I went to the local VW boneyard yesterday with a tape measure.  It looks 
like all bread-loaf seats are the same (at least on the bottom).  Vanagon 
seats seem to be about 1/4 in. wider at the seat track.  I don't know 
about the Eurovans.  They did have one but I didn't bother measuring it.
