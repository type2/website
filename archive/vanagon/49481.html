Subject:      Re: EV Reliability and Stalling


Our '93 MV has been very reliable. One major electrical problem (hi-
speed fan relay died causing overheating and then blowing of the A/C: war-
ranty repaired). Otherwise only routine maintenance; we love ours.
For Moe Walters: we had a problem with occasional stalling when the A/C
was on; it was fixed up a slight increasing the idle speed.
