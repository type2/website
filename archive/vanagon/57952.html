&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm personally glad that your brit-ass is off this volkswagon
&gt; &gt; &gt; list....I'm not racist, i'm just tired of seeing ads from across the
&gt; &gt; &gt; sea with vehicles I can't afford to buy because of shitty shipping or
&gt; &gt; &gt; travelling costs..........no offense

&gt; Charles White,
&gt; What the hell is this crap??  Sounds like someone needs to realize that
&gt; there are more countries in the world than the USA and they have
&gt; Volkswagens too.  Speaking of Volkswagen, learn how to spell it, for
&gt; God's sake, it's written on the back of EVERY ONE!
