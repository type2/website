Subject: grills, grills, grills



anybody know of a north american source of replacement
radiator grills for a 4 light system? not the late model
rectangular lights, but a grill that will accept 7&quot;
round lights. i have heard that they are available in
europe and, of all places, s.africa. (actually, the
van scene in s.africa is supposed to be quite
active - dealer installed golf/jetta engines, 
other companies dropping in ford v-6 (2800 cc!?), i 
think it stems from the s. african goverment's
laws on auto sales and percentage of auto manufactured
in the country).
