Subject: Weekender Sunroof Lube

A month ago I posted a message requesting info about a lubricant for the
biggie sunroof in my '85 Weekender. The roof mechanism worked fine, but
knowing replacement of the mechanism is a major project, I wanted to do
whatever preventive stuff I could. 

Who needs a sudden broken cable with the roof open miles from shelter?!

Mark Skidmore, a former Audi technician responded with a recommendation of
3M Silicone Lubricant, &quot;Wet Type&quot;, P/N 051135-0887.

$6 a can.

I called 3M's 800-number and they got me connected with a can of the stuff.

What a difference it makes in a reduction of sliding resistance of the
roof! It may have prevented some failure in the future.

So, I thought I post this for those with sunroofs.

It also made the (2) sliding windows move easier. No more squeel.
