Subject: Re: hoses for pipes
Date: Fri, 13 Jun 97 12:49:26 EDT

&gt; Hi all
&gt; I had my Transporter checked, and the mechanic said that the long
&gt; coolant pipes under tha car were leaking. 

That seems to happen sooner or later on all the older Transporter/Vanagons.
Newer ones have plastic pipes.

&gt; Replacement costs $1200.

Ridiculous, as usually.

&gt; wonder if it would be possible to use reinforced plastichoses to replace
&gt; the bad parts of the pipe. Any experiences?

Some people use radiator hose all the way. To do this I would guess
you need to attach it in more places under the bus than the original
attachement points for the rigid pipe.

Your idea of just replacing the bad parts with hose sounds excellent. 
Let me guess: the pipes are rusted only in the exposed parts near the 
engine, but fine elsewhere?

Has anyone tried replacing the pipes with PVC domestic hot water 
pipes?

A recommendation to everyone who still have the steel pipes
(whole or in part). Sand them and paint them with &quot;rusty metal
primer&quot; (eg. Rustoleum # 7769). This is a fish-oil based primer
which works well on rusted surfaces.

I painted my pipes some years ago when they started to show rust
spots, and the paint holds up well despite the temperature.
(But don't try it on the exhaust components!)

PS: Remembering our previous head leak discussion: You're lucky
that a simple pipe leak was your problem, not the heads.
