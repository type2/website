Thanks to all who replied on the loose switch on my info
panel . . . fixed

Has no one replaced the rear speakers in their Westy?  I guess I
will embark on a quest . . .

Next question . . . Has anyone come up with a great place to put a
CD changer in a Westy?  I was thinking in the cabinet, under the
sink.  Any other ideas?
