Subject: Re: Pilot bearing on T4


&gt; The pilot bearing on my 1700cc crank is stuck in the end of the
&gt; crankshaft.  I need to remove it because it looks dirty and I want to
&gt; clean it.  How do you get it out?  The pilot lubricating felt is
&gt; missing.  Can you make one yourself, or must it be bought?

Hi Aaron,
  there's a tool called a pilot bearing puller (which is just a very small
puller). jc whitney had one in their catalogue a while back. or borrow one
from your local shop ???
  good luck,
                gregor
