This has all the ear marks of an old joke, I hope some you you haven't 
read it before.   
	johnny Stutsman  '81 Westy (in pieces)


This one was recently reprinted in The Winneconne (WI) News, and was
originally attributed to Byron McNutt of the Vilas County News Review.

A van carrying a dozen movie stuntmen on the way to a film location in the
mountains spun out of control on the icy road, crashed through a guardrail,
rolled down a 90-foot embankment, turned over, and burst into flames. There
were no injuries.
