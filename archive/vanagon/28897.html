 Howdy all.
Well, my sketchy-at-best brakes on the '67 have finally gone too far.
As you may recall, it all started when I replaced my flex lines (all 4)
about 2 months ago. This new, increased flow proceeded to blow out my
master cylinder, as well as a couple wheel cylinders. I replaced the MC
with an earlier style, 1 chamber model, mainly because of cost. I have a
new wheel cylinder for the passenger rear, as it really leaks, and
rebuild kits for the others, which aren't bad. AS a note, there are now
3 compression fittings in the system, put in to adapt the different
master cylinder.
Anyway, The system previously had been losing pressure. When I would get
in the bus for the first time in a day or so, The pedal would sink to
the floor. I would then pull it back, and all would be well. However, on
an extended trip, I noticed my gas mileage was very bad. I stopped at a
rest stop, and noticed that the driver's front wheel was barely smoking,
and theat the 2 rear wheels were very hot as well. I limped home, hoping
the pressure would abate. However, yesterday, I tried to drive across
town, and found the brakes to be super-tight, and still dragging.

So-Help! IS it the master cylinder gone bad? That would be my guess, as
it does affect the whole system. Would continued use with leaking wheel
cyls cause a 2-month old MC to go bad???
Help please, as I am scheduled to make a decent trip this weekend...
Thanks,
Richard
