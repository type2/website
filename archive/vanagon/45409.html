Subject: Diesel cooling problems

HI!
Thanks to all who responded concerning the problem with my '82 diesel.  
Unfortunately, my mail has been down since last Monday, ans all the 
responses are gone! :(  Ive tracked down a replacement tank for an 
excellent price from VolksMotor-Sports. (Thanks Kyle.)
Im reposting a question, so if youve already responded, please do so again!
how do I get all of the old coolant out? Ive disconnected hoses to the 
pump and ran h2o through them already.  What else?  Also should I buy the 
&quot;phosphate free&quot; coolant Ive read about on the list, or is there 
something else for diesels?  If the phosphate free stuff is the answer, 
is it only available at the dealer, or can I buy it anywhere?
Any answers are appreciated!
