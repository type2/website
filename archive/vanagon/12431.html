dave:

i know that feeling of terror when you wake up to find a puddle in the bus!
My 73' has the same problem, and i have been meaning to get around to
ordering a new rubber seal to replace the somewhat rotted out one. The
reason i have been procrastinating is that i am afraid of busting my NOS
windshield in the process of replacing the rubber gasket. ANy thought on
how to do this? I hope that a rubber gasket will solve the problem, and
that rust repair isn't warranted too.

&gt; It rained last night and when I hopped into the '74 this morning I noticed
&gt; a puddle of water on the floor in front on the passengers side. Window open?
&gt; Nope. Went looking around on the outside and found - Yikes! - RUST UNDER THE
&gt; WINDSHIELD!! This must be the result of bad karma from having given Sami so
&gt; much grief about driving in the salt of Missouri. But seriously, what has to
&gt; be done to fix this? Does new metal need to be welded in? Has anybody on the
&gt; list made this repair?
&gt;
&gt; Unhappily realizing that the years are indeed passing by for &quot;Young Fred&quot;
