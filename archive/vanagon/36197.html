        Reply to:   Digifant Missing - $100 Harness workaround

To All:

Here's the info on the cheapie harness replacement from Lars Herrnsdorf in
Gottenborg Sweden,  posted to the list last 11/17.  His English is a little
&quot;quaint&quot; but I believe it adds to the good homebrew flavor of his fix.  Good
luck!

--------------------------------------

My first experience related to the problem was when I drove on the highway on
a constant speed  and after an hour or so my engine just suddenly lose all
power, and  after I stop and start again it work fine , the same problem that
Derek has told  about in the Technical bulletin TB#12 and TB#13 he has put
togeteher from VW information he has.  I phone some friends in Sweden and
quite soon I understod that the problem was known as well as very special.
This was back in 93.

It seems like that the fault first was found in Sweden but when reported first
didn't  the german compane Boch belive that it was a problem with the air flow
meter but a local VW service person  use a oscilloscope to monitor the output
voltage from the resistor wiper that measure the air flow value during a long
measuring time. And his work pays off; He found out that if the engine runs
for a long time very constant and specially also when the weather type is
little frosty then the wiper could start to lose the electrical contact on the
resistor trace (It is not to easy to find the word in english, but I think you
understand what  I mean)  and the voltage starts to  oscillate instead of have
 a relative stable value. 

The DIGIJET (and probely DIGIFANT) electronically box accumulate this
oscillator voltage value , but after a while it thinks it is a malfunction and
shut of the electronic pulses to that control the gasoline flow to the engine:
the engine suddenly lose all power !!. When the engine is restarted all memory
in the control box is reseted and the engine runs fine until the same
situation happens again , that can take days, weeks or may not happen again 

The solution ( (if the gurantee is passed and you don't want to try the $100
version first )at least for a while ( if the air flow wiper resistance trace
is totally unconducting(worn out) then the whole air flow meter has to be
exchanged)) is to  stabilize the output voltage round its oscillating average
value., The air flow box  connector has four pins. Between pin 1 and 4 is the
NTC-1 resistor that measures the temperature inside the air flow meter.
Between  pin 4 and 3 is the Potentiometer endpoints and pin 2 is the wiper of
the potentiometer that moves by the air flow and also is the output voltage
signal that must not oscillate. The easiest way is to add a $0.5 25 V  10 uF
tantal capacitor  with its +side  connected to pin 4 and its common to pin 2
(who is the air flow voltage output) to stabilise the voltage.  Later  Boch
came out with the $100 box that I think more or less make the same thing. 
Practically I mount the capasitor on a two wire 15 cm cable that I  solder on
the pin 4 and 2 (note the polarity) in the connector that mounts on the air
flow meter box on the top. and then taped so it was completely water resistant
and dust resistant.

I can only say that I have not have the problem ever since. but You never know
if this fix  was the whole solution for  the engine power lose. God Luck!!  If
it not works , don't  blame me, if it works use your other $ 99 to something
more fun!
