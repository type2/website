NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Flush with clear water, please!

That Prestone Flush crap is perfect for American Detroit Iron.  I
wouldn't trust it in a VW Cooling System.  Hell, I won't even use it on
my 73 Toyota Pickup!

&gt;Hi, gang, and many thanks for all the fascinating info about coolants!
&gt;
&gt;I acquired Prestone phosphate-free long-life at Pep Boys (Wal-Mart was
&gt;out, and PB honored their lowest price policy with Wal-Mart as their
&gt;&quot;competitor&quot;!).  While there, I also picked up some Prestone Super
&gt;Flush, but now I have misgivings.  To wit:
&gt;
&gt;SHOULD I FLUSH THE VANAGON COOLING SYSTEM WITH THIS STUFF?
&gt;
&gt;If so, any tips on how?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your input!!!
