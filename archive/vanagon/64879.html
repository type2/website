Subject:      Re: Unreal oil consumption on diesel Vanagon

I would check the crankcase ventilation system.  The steady stream of smoke
indicates this. This was a common problem with diesel rabbits.  The oil would
flow up the vent and fill the intake manifold.  Sometimes to the point that
the could would not slow down when closing the throttle.  As you fitted a non
Vanagon engine in there, you may have a baffle problem or need to rig some
type of oil separator/return to get the liquid back to the crankcase.  Also,
make sure you are not over filling the engine.  Try running it a quart low and
see if the situation improves.  As far as I'm concerned, a VW engine should
never be filled to the top mark anyway.  Hope this helps,
Dennis
