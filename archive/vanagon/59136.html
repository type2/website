 &gt;My '80 Westy had this &quot;Fukengruven&quot; bumper sticker - just like the

 &gt;took it off!  Now that she's a worldly 6-year old, i wish still had it. Can
 &gt;anyone out there tell me where to find one, or does anyone have an extra to
 &gt;sell? &gt;&gt;

How 'bout this one.....
Fahrfromovin: the feeling experienced by VW van drivers, and those
unfortunate enough to be stuck behind them.......

the long haired stick figure on this one appears to be smoking a rather large
funny looking &quot;cigarette&quot;......  :&lt;)
