Bob, 
I was wondering if you would put together engines for people?  I 
personally don't trust the bulk engine rebuilders.  I'm sure there's more 
than one person on the list that could use an engine built by someone 
that pays attention to detail.  So how much would you charge for building 
up an engine?

I CC's the list because I don't think anyone I've seen anyone ask this, 
and I know some people don't have time to build their own engine.

Bradley
