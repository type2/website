&lt;&lt; 3. my dometic fridge doesnt have any of the inside shelves etc I 
 would like to know a source for these and also if some one could 
 describe them to me so that maybe i can make some for instace is there a 
 way of making ice in the fridge? and are there some sort of retainers in 
 the door? &gt;&gt;

I recently improvised with a copuple of shelves in the ice box in my 87
Syncro.  I used 12&quot; deep closet shelves from the hardware store.  The kind
made of a wire grid &amp; coated with white plastic.   To help hold thing from
sliding out the front I boudht a pair of small spring loaded curtain rods.
 They're the type with rubber tips on each end meant to be sprung inside the
sides of a home window.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
