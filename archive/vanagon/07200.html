Subject: Euro-Bago sighting
Date: Mon, 28 Nov 94 17:49:16 PST

  Went to the auto show in San Francisco yesterday and saw the Euro-Bago for
  the  first time. It was the ONLY Eurovan that VW was showing. Price is 22K
  for the VW part and 8-9K for the Winnebago part - they are listed seperately.
  The extra length of the long Eurovan is very apparent. The camper layout is
  somewhat Westfalia like, most everything on the left side of the vehicle.
  There was an extra &quot;couch&quot; w/ seatbelts and all which fits in the middle
  and raises the passenger capacity to 6. In the rear cabinetry, where tail
  gate opens, they have included one of those kitchen sink style sprayers-on-
  the-end-of-a-hose things so one can (presumably) take a bit of a shower.
  There are two tables, each about 18 x 36 inches, that mount on one end in a
  track on the cabinetry and have a free leg on the other. The tables can be
  slid fore and aft (and together) as desired. The front seats rotate like
  a '76 and later Westfalia. Quality of materials and fit/finish looked okay.

  If anyone has specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them.


  Dave &quot;no, I don't have $30K either&quot; Kautz
