I'm another Dave who is 6'4&quot;+, and I also sleep head to the rear. One very
hot night along the Sacramento River in Northern Calif. I decided to try
out the factory issue rear door mosquito netting. It worked well for a
while, but because my 83 Westy didn't have any snaps along the bottom edge
of the screen, I gradually pushed out the bottom with my head. I awoke in
the middle of the night to find my body covered in nasty bites, so I closed
the hatch, trapping a couple dozen well-fed mosquitos in with me. The next
morning they were all up in the canvas tent section, so I was able to get
my revenge. But the bites hurt for a few days.
