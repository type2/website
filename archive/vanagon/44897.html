Hi Everyone!

I was at Costco the other day and saw a case of Chevron Delco Motor Oil.  The
carton said specially formulated for Diesel Engines for use with all
fuels...even low sulfer ones!  What the heck does these mean?  Is this oil
different than others, if so how?  It had all the standard API ratings
including CD (is that the Diesel one?).  With all the recent discussion on
oils, maybe someone can clue us in!

Thanks a Bunch!
