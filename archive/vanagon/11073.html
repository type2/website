&gt; It's really easy to break those little defrost wires.  One pass with a
&gt; razor blade can wipe out all of them.  I once removed the tint from a
&gt; rear window for reasons similar to yours, and even though I was very careful,
&gt; I broke two of the lines.  I would leave it to a professional, and let them
&gt; know in no uncertain terms that they had better not break any of the
&gt; defroster wires.  Try to find a place that can supply references, since
&gt; I don't know of any way to repair the wires once they are broken.

  I've heard that a small drop of conductive epoxy will sometimes fix those.
