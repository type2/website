Subject: ignition key sticks

Suddenly, my ignition key doesn't want to turn some times when I try to
start my '85 Westy.  The weather here has suddenly cooled so it may be
temperature related.  ( bought it in Dallas this summer.)

Has anyone else had this problem or any suggestions.  The idea of replacing
the cylinder is very unattractive.

Thanks,

Rob
