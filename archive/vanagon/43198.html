&gt;
&gt;So we heard. I guess there are about three questions for the next phone
call to the the 
&gt;seller/converter (if he is willing to share his knowledge):
&gt;(1) What is the part number for the fuel tank? 
&gt;(2) Besides the bellhousing, any other mod required to the drivetrain?
&gt;(3) What else should a potential converter have to look out for?
&gt;

&gt;      It would be interesting to hear what he has to say about the gearing.
No reason to guess how it would be since he has tried it.
