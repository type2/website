Subject: re:propane gauge?

Here's a Friday solution to the propane gauge problem.  Take your tank off.
 Weigh it empty.  Fill it and weigh it full.  Then, just take it off and
weigh it whenever you want to know how much gas is in it.

On the other hand, one of those liquid crystal temperature strips ought to
work...
