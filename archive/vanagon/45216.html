Subject: Cow Magnets and Bosch Fuel Filters

Well I had to put on a new fuel filter on Thursday evening since Lief almost 
didn't get Caron home from work due to off-and-on fuel pressure.  This solved the 
problem and we had no other problems on our weekend camping trip 
(Vancouver-&gt;Hope-&gt;Osoyoos-&gt;Pentiction-&gt;Peachland-&gt;Merritt-&gt;Spence's 
Bridge-&gt;Hope-&gt;Harrison Hot Springs-&gt;Vancouver).  But then the same thing happened 
yesterday.

Now I remember a discussion a while back about putting a very strong magnet on (or 
was it in?) the gas tank to collect rust and prevent it from getting into the fuel 
lines and plugging up the filter.  I was a bit surprised that this would work 
since I didn't think that rust was magnetic (is it?).  If anyine has had success 
with this please let me know.  And where would I get such a magnet?  How strong 
does it have to be?  Where would I put it?

Also, I thought I saw a referenece a day or two ago about Bosch fuel filters.  
Someone said that they are crap.  I can't find the message so I'd appreciate any 
comments since I'm using Bosch filters.  Should I go the a dealer (gasp, choke, 
...) to get my filters.  I figure I'll be swapping filters every week or two until 
I have time and money to take my tank out and have a look at it.
