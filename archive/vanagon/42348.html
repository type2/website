Subject: FS: 200 VW Toys

Hi All,

A friend of mine is selling off his collection of 200 or so VW toys.  
Tins, diecast, etc.  There is a 6 page detailed list of all his stuff 
(handwritten).  He would like to sell the lot.  email me if you have a 
serious interest in this and please include your snail mail address.  If 
he still has it all in a few weeks, I'll repost when he is ready to start 
selling items individually.  Thanks.
