Subject: Need help on '86 Idle Adjustment

I just replaced my '86 wasserboxer engine _at_ 186K miles and I haven't got
it running right yet. The idle control valve and O2 sensor are
also new. The dealership told me that the sensitivity of the idle 
control valve is not tunable, but yet it runs anywhere from 1400 to 1900 
RPM when it's plugged in (and no extra load). Can anyone shed any light 
on this puzzle? Thanks in advance for your help! 

Regards, Vance
