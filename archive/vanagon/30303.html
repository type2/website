Subject: Re: Sleeping in Campers

&gt;Hi all, 
&gt;	I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while 
&gt;going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep? 

Well, the only time I have slept in my 71 was in the winter, so I slept 
with my head to the inside.  My feet were better insulated inside the 
sleeping bag than my head would have been (unless my head was inside 
the sleeping bag...)
