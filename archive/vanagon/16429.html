Subject: Re: Cheap Heat Exchangers

&gt;Many years ago I had a '69 bus, whose original heat exchangers were
&gt;wonderful. On a zero-degree Colorado night, fire the bus up, get on the
&gt;freeway, and ten minutes later you could take off your jacket and drive
&gt;in shirtsleeves.
&gt;
&gt;Finally one heat exchanger developed an exhaust leak, so I replaced both
&gt;with inexpensive replacements, aftermarket types I guess. (Not J-tubes).
&gt;The heat output of the new ones was only a fraction of the old ones-- I was
&gt;_very_ disappointed. I don't know what the differences were, but they had
&gt;to be significant. Unfortunately, I also don't know what to look for when
&gt;shopping for them now, which I have to do for my recently-purchased '71 bus.
&gt;I'm considering J-tubes and a gas heater, just to avoid a recurrence of the 
&gt;past disappointment.
&gt;
&gt;The moral of the story is, if you buy new heat exchangers, make sure
&gt;(somehow...?) that they are identical to the originals, in airflow, metal
&gt;composition, number of internal fins, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!

You didn't get the &quot;race&quot; exchangers by chance?  They look like the real
thing, but have no exchanger core, they are sold as &quot;lightweights.&quot;  They
provide little or no heat.

Sincerely,
Eugene

PS, now I feel really bad about those manifolds, I shoulda tried harder.
