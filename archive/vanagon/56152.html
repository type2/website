Subject: Re: Need plastic/chrome window deco

&gt;| Does anyone know where I can get some of the plastic chrome-colored deco
&gt;| strip material that is inserted in the Vanagon windshield rubber?

	Could breaks in this strip cause small leaks in the windsheild seal?
I went around the whole windsheild looking for places where the seal had
pulled away from the body or was even not smashed up against the body, but
couldn't find anything obvious. I do have a couple 1&quot; long sections missing
in the insert and was wondering if anyone had experience with this causing
leaks... If not, I guess it is time to pull out a tube od silicone sealant
and wait for a dry day (and then remember on the dry day instead of going
somewhere in the dry sunshine ;) )
