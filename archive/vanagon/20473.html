We (List Members) may be getting ore mail than we expected ...

While doing some exploring, I ventured onto the

			rec.autos.vw
newsgroup.

To my surpirise there was a recent message from SSGSPEARS (etc., etc.)

In the body of the message ...readers were invited to direct their 'van' questions and 
general interests to a special interest group by subscribing to:

	vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

Wen each of us gets the SUBSCRIBE messages, there's now an explanation for the 
nuisance.
