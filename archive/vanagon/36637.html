Subject: Valve cover leak

 Hi volkspeople! Like it is customary, to the point.

 I'm curious in finding out why would a valve cover leak in the very same
spot for the third time. I've changed gaskets twice, check the valve cover,
the part where it mounts and there are no cracks, ruptures or anything in
the likes. I'm going to try a different material and see what happens.

 Any comments, ideas, etc. will be listened to and appreciated. TIA
