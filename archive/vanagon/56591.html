I just called and ordered a bottle. Costs $4.00 for an 8 ounce bottle
(aerosol or non-aerosol). If you use a credit card, they don't charge you
shipping!

&gt; 
&gt; Last night, I found myself in the difficult predicament of having to
remove 
&gt; a Vanagon AC compressor, held on with an allen-head bolt, without the 
&gt; proper allen key.  All I had was a pair of vice grips, and the bolt head
is 
&gt; completely round, so they just kept slipping.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I tried a product that Kyle Wade turned me on to, called Kroil.  He 
&gt; swore it was like liquid wrench times ten. I put a couple of drops on the

&gt; bolt, and it practically slid off by itself.  Tried it on some other
tight 
&gt; bolts, same results.  
&gt; 
&gt; I believe they sell direct (615-833-4101). Anyone else ever try this
stuff?
