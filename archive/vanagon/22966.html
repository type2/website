Subject: Gauges for Vanagons

Hi all,

I get a little uneasy on long trips having only a temperature gauge and an
oil pressure light to inform me of the engine's condition. So, I'd like to
add a few additional gauges to my 87 Vanagon.  I like the VDO 2&quot; Cockpit
style gauges and want to add an oil temperature, oil pressure, battery
voltage and maybe an ammeter.  The problem is that I haven't found a
satisfactory way to mount these gauges that's both reasonably attractive and
easy to see.  To the right of the stereo (above the glovebox) through the
dash metal would be attractive enough but it'd be quite a stretch to see.  On
top of the regular instrument housing would be ideal for visibility but I
haven't found any decent looking housing to mount them in.
Has anyone added some gauges?  Where / how did you place them?  How do you
like the result?
