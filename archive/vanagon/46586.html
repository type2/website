Ron et alia.

I got a call from Englad on Minday and my 89 yr old father is very ill.
I will consequently leave San Francisco for London this Saturday and will not
be back in time.

THis has been a very difficult decision for me as when I was an undergraduate
at Oxford in 1963 I took a trip up to the Arctic circle in Norway/Finland and
Sweden. 6 undergraduate formed thr Brasenose College expedition to Lapland
and we drove 5000  miles of whicj over 1000 was on the gravel/corrugated
roads in the permafrost north. We even saw thr midnight sun at NordCap.

So all my best to you all and I just wish thayt I could be with you all
