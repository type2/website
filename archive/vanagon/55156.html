Subject: sagging handle syndrome
Date: Tue, 28 Jan 97 14:00:25 PST




Has anybody else noticed how many Vanagons have sagging or broken-off sliding
door handles?  

50%??  

Higher???

Having removed my sagging handle and noted the poor design, I am looking for a
new or used one.  I have an '82, did the design get beefier in the newer
models?  Should I shell out $80 for a new one at the dealers?  Or does anybody
have a line on another source for handles?
