Subject: engine stoping

I am afraid I have to open my first post with an apology.  I deleted the
listserver instructions for the vanagon list on my first viewing.  It would
be greatly appreciated if someone could forward a copy.  The crux of my van
problem is an engine that just died at 55 mph with little warning (and
restarted as though there was no problem). There was a brief 5 to 10 second
period of reduced power before the engine completely stalled. It has a new
dealer installed coil and alternator.  The temp guage was perfectly vertical
throughout this time, but the engine seemed to restart and run fine after a
5 minute period of cooling.  After getting us back down the road again about
5 miles it when thorugh this same cycle again. This is my 5th day of trouble
free use and about 175 miles of travel. Any trouble shooting tips would be a
big help before I limp over to the local repair shop.
   
Thank You

p.s. are there any ASI conversion owners out there that I could dredge for
basic operating information on propane and electrical systems?
