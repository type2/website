Subject: WBX Discs &amp; Drums

Hi all,

My '92 Transporter (equivalent to the Weekender MV in the US) recently
clocked over 100,000 kms (62,000m) and has just had it's next scheduled
service.I've owned it since new so can account for it's full service
history.
All OK,running very well and still 40% of the front and rear brake pads
left.It's not a city car which partly explains the good brake pad mileage
(as well as utilizing the 5 speed manual gearbox whenever possible for
engine braking)

Anyway,whilst the pads are still OK for now,it was brought to my attention
that when they are changed in the forseeable future,the front discs and
rear drums will at least need re-machining and quite likely need to be
replaced if the wear is beyond machining limits.

Now it's not that I doubt my VW mechanics.They are trustworthy guys who
I've known for many years now.They don't pile on the BS and wouldn't
say it needed doing if it didn't,but I was wondering what was the experience
of list members with higher milage vans.At what milage have you guys found
that similar wear has occured? I would have expected the discs and drums
to be right for several changes of pads (barring any stones etc getting
stuck in there) as is the case with my bay window Crew Cab.I have done
more than 130,000km in the 6 years I've had it,changed the pads twice
(once recently) and the discs &amp; drums are still OK (not great but...)

It's not that I mind getting the work done when it needs it,the van's in
exceptional original condition and always garaged,but it's just that I'm
curious...Is that typical for later model vans? Am I hopelessly optimistic
with my expectation of disc &amp; drum life expectancy? 

Thanks,
