	Steven Johnson advised Compu-fire breakerless
distributor, and that's what ECI is building mine with.
Interestingly enough, ECI tried using the VW hydraulic
lifters and don't like them- they machine the case 
and use GM lifters. I have to admit, GM probably
knows as much as there is to know about hydraulic lifters.
The nice thing about VWs is you seldom have to argue about
what God and Dr. Porsche intended... 

	The engine comes with all-new tin, except for
the blanking piece in front of the engine (FIF), which
I've got. So the only remaining mysteries are the
air-cleaner and the exhaust. 
	I think 1970 is supposed to have a thermostat
of some kind on the air-cleaner, and I don't.

	Thanks to everyone who posted a message to the
effect that it was ok to buy an engine built-up instead
of building it myself. I couldn't have done this
without the help of everyone on this list, and I
really appreciate it!
