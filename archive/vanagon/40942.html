Subject: Re: Q: one vs. two Carbs

In a message dated 96-04-30 08:28:09 EDT, you write:

&gt; A local VW guru thinks I should stick 
&gt;to the dual carbs.  He says if they are running good, they will out-
&gt;perform the weber due to the shorter intake distances.  I like the 
&gt;idea of one carb instead of two headaches.  Is the difference in 
&gt;performance significant?

you think that you have headaches now?  Wait 'til you try to make that Weber
DFEV try to do anything but bog, spit, backfire, give free gas to the wind
gods, and freeze shut in the winter.  HEED THIS WARNING!  find someone to
fix/tune your duals right.  Then make real nice with this person.  They will
be your friend for many years to come.  Tuning OEM dual carbs is an art.
 But, man, when they're right, you would laugh at fuel injection.  These
things are the smoothest things out there.  And suprisingly good fuel mileage
as well.  They have power that fuel injection can't touch.

I say keep 'em and treat 'em right.  Well, you asked me.
