Subject: Re: battery info requested

&gt;Years back, there was a TV ad for a battery which had a special
&gt;reserve (almost like a second battery within a battery) capability.
&gt;The scene I recall was a guy's wife going into labor - they rushed
&gt;outside to get in the car and go to the hospital, only to find that
&gt;the battery had gone dead.  However, with this special feature,
&gt;they merely had to flip a switch of some sort, which called upon
&gt;the other side of the battery, and the car would start in
&gt;an emergency.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone remember who made this battery?  Or if it is still
&gt;being manufactured?
&gt;
&gt;Thanx,
&gt;

There were a couple of these batteries around.  One was by Interstate
Batteries and the other by Champion called The Switch.

  I had two of the Champions onefor my wife's 1972 Pontiac Luxury LeMans and
one for my Westy.  When I came to Minnesota she was still down in Ohio and
would end up being there for about 10 months.  When the Battery in her car
died, instead of taking it back to Wal-Mart, she Switched it with the one in
the Westy.  Then she sold her car with new battery in it!  So now I have a
dead Switch in the Westy!

  The hard part now is finding where in Minnesota I can get The Switch.  The
is an 800 number on the battery that I haven't tried yet but will.  It is
1-800-447-4700 ext 600.  This is for the Dealer Hotline.

  I heard that Interstate discontinued their version.  Something about too
many complaints.

Good Luck finding one!:-)
