I was thinking about this too.  The reason that I was thinking about
this was that Martha mentioned it.

One thing that might work would be a big circle.  People could join
the caravan and drop back out, and the caravan itself could proceed,
with its own life...  

Tentative idea...  Start in California in July 95.  North to Washington,
east across the northern US to New York,  South to Alabama (or do
we make a wide detour around Alabama?), then west across the southern
US back to California.  Wherever you live, you could get in for part
of the great trip.

There would undoubtedly be places along the way where we could log in
as guest and keep in contact with the Real World of Netland.
