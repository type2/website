Subject: ENGINE SEAL--for 76 Westy

Ok,

Since I got chewed out a bit during the last CCC's camping trip about not
having a engine seal and that my engine would be running way to hot--does
anyone have recommendations on where the best place to get one from is and
also are we talking pretty easy to put in???

Thanks in advance for the help.

Joe
