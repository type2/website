Subject: coil spring adjusters \ 73 bus

Dear list,
  I recently got my hands on a couple of COIL SPRING ADJUSTERS from jc
whitneys. They're supposed to remedy the &quot;sagging rear end&quot; that all loafers
know about. What these things do is basically pry apart a section of the rear
coil spring, with the net effect of raising the rear end somewhat. In severe
cases this may not be sufficient, and you'll probably have to do the torsion
bar adjustment. Since my case is not too bad, I figure I'll go with this
gizmo. I was wondering though if there are any disadvantages to this that
some of you can think of ? Hidden lurking dangers? Severe taboos???
  Sunny weekend,
                    G.
