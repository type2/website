Subject: Re: new category on the stats?

Ellis and his alter ego are rallying around the new category of
&quot;Retro-rust.&quot;  Take a vehicle that has been restored to original condition,
submerge it in salt water for a full year then drive it in Michigan for a
winter or two. I guess the next step would be to sell it to either
D.Easterwood or B. Hufford! ;)  


 why not have RetroWesties added to the stats...RuMbA wants her own 
&gt;category!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;jonathan ('74 RetroWestia...RuMbA..)
&gt;
&gt;Uh-oh... don't start such a dangerous trend! Nex thing you know, people
&gt;will want seperate categories for retro-sunroofs, retro-deluxes, and
&gt;(shudder) retro-engines!
&gt;
&gt;Please, please don't turn that blabbermouth Steve with his V6anagon loose
&gt;on us again! All he does is talk about how great the engine in it is,
&gt;how macho he is as a result, etc. etc.!
