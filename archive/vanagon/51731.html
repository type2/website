Subject: OEM Cupholders

Hey! Stop laughing! This is serious! 

My buddy's Carat came with all the original cupholders broken or
removed, and I'd like to get four for the Syncro Westie as well. 

I saw the thread in the archives about OEM cupholders
being seen at K-Mart or Wal-Mart. Well, around here, no luck.
Wal-mart doesn't have anything like it, K-Mart has a cheap
imitation, no joy either at the local warehouse-type parts 
stores. So several questions:

(1) Anybody seen any lately?
(2) Where?
(3) Are they really identical to the VW unit, or just similar.
If that is the case, maybe it was the K-Mart version (with a
spring steel band holding the cup) was the item talked about earlier.
(4) Anybody actually buy one and know who the manufacturer is;
maybe I could contact them to find someone retailing them?

Any and all help appreciated.

Tom F.
