Subject: Re: What should I look for or avoid in 84 Westy?



&gt;Are there significant differences between the 83.5, 84 and 85?
&gt;Should I desperately try to find the extra money to get a later 
&gt;model?  I read some reports of problems with the water pump and 
&gt;cooling system in the early wasserboxers - were these faults 
&gt;really a big problem, and were they fixed in later models? 

85 came with a tach and a digital clock (also on the earlier 
Wolfsburg models, I believe, and maybe even the '84 GL).  Also, the 
'85 GL usually had power steering and air, plus nicer fabric on the 
interior (the striped fabric on the '84 and earlier does not wear 
very well).  Other than that, to my knowledge '83-85 are basically 
the same.  I can't say much about the '86 up, since I've only had 
'85 back, but they did put in a 2.1L in '86 plus redesigned the 
cooling system.  However, from the '86 up owners I have spoken to, 
I believe the major problem areas were not much improved.  These 
problem areas include:

1) Cooling system.  I would drive the van for about ten minutes, 
and then let it idle for a good 20 minutes and see if the temp 
guage goes much above 1/2 way.  By now, the radiator should be a 
bit hot to the touch, and above the 1/2 way mark the fan on the 
radiator should come on. If the radiator is not warm, the coolant 
is not flowing properly.  If the van overheats, see below.

2) Heads/head gaskets.  A problem with all Vanagon years, I 
understand.  If the van overheats once, or the coolant is not 
changed regularly, these can be a problem.  Look carefully for 
signs of coolant around the heads (or any sort of aftermarket 
sealant applied around the heads).  Look for signs of coolant in 
the exhaust (white smoke). If the van has a coolant leak or if the 
coolant is not flowing properly, it may have been overheated, and 
your heads or head gaskets may be damaged.  If you need them, this 
is not a cheap repair.  I have yet to buy a Vanagon wasserboxer 
that didn't either need head gaskets, or already have had them 
replaced.

3)  Water pump.  Many Vanagons I've looked at have had it replaced, 
or had leaks. 

4)	Steering rack.  Look for excessive play.  Again, many 
Vanagons I've looked at had this replaced before 100k miles, 
indicating a problem area.

There are probably other common problem areas, but I haven't run 
into them yet.  In general, I have found the watercooled campers to 
be less reliable that the air cooled ones (I'm sure I'll get flamed 
for this one!), and more difficult/expensive to repair.  On the 
plus side, they sure are plush inside, have nicer amenities (like 
better heat, and a fridge that really works), have more power, and 
more room.  I love camping in my '85, more than in my '77, but I 
miss my '77 when I have to pay for a part for the '85.

By the way, if anyone is interested, I will have an 83-1/2 Westy 
with 85,000 miles for sale very soon - just as soon as the head 
gaskets are replaced!
