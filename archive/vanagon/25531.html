Subject:       Re: BUSES, VALUE, &amp; RESALE

&gt; Has anyone out there ever seen a real &quot;bluebook&quot; for older buses?  From an 
&gt; insurance point of view, I was quoted $150 a year for coverage when I asked 
&gt; about a '78 bus, IN DC, &amp; I'M IN MY 20's.  I was told that personal property 
&gt; tax would be $25.  This is great for now, but what happens when some fool 
&gt; hits me? (After all, DC can be pretty crazy)  Do I get a check from the 
&gt; insurance company for $50 because that's all it is worth?  I know an 
&gt; appraiser can give a value for an individual vehicle, but I was wondering if 
&gt; indeed there are older bluebook values with fair, good, excellent 
&gt; conditions, etc.  I seldom see buses for sale here in Wash DC and they vary 
&gt; so much that is almost impossible to compare.  I am going nuts trying to get 
&gt; one (even though I've never even stuck my head in one).  If I had a baseline 
&gt; &quot;value&quot;, I could add or subtract extra costs necessary to get it in the 
&gt; condition I want.  Again, any advise is appreciated.

When I went to get insurance on my '57, I had to give the insurance 
company pictures, because I wanted it insured for $5000.  Of course 
my premiums are a good deal more than yours.  About $80 a month.

BTW, I think it is time to start a class-action suit against all 
insurance companies for sexual and age discrimination.  My rates are 
higher soley because I am a male, and am under 25.  Basing my rates 
on others of the same sex, soley because they are of the same sex is 
very descriminatory.  But that doesn't apply to the insurance 
industry, right!?  &lt;grin&gt;

You know, we might have a remote chance on the sexual discrimination 
part, but I don't think the world is recognizing age descrimination 
as un-PC yet...
