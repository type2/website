Subject: 1600 or 1700 in a 73??  what i decided
Date: Thu, 4 Jan 1996 10:21:57 -0800 (PST)

hi all,
	well, after thinking and talking and listening i think the way
to go sounds like building an extra 1700 engine and then swap.  it
looks like a big project, but i figure i'll start reading now, and
then this spring/summer jump on into it building one up.  assuming i
can get the parts i need, would working weekends give me a motor in
four months?  anyone have an idea of the cost associated with building
a 1700 motor?

some of the main points people made were (feel free to argue:)
- need to fabricate an engine tin
- modify the engine mounts
- that once you make the &quot;recomended&quot; modifications to a 1600 you have
  spent about as much as for a 1700
- a 1700 will last longer, and be cheeper on cost per mile in the long
  run

i've never torn an engine down but with the compression test (105 - 95
- 98 - 75) looks like i may be doing a thing or two to the current
engine relatively soon.  i think between that and reading (and the
list's gracious advice:) i can do it (fingers crossed) given patience
and time.  i've begun looking through the archives so we'll see what i
figure out.  anyone know of an easy cheap way to get a hold of an old
(broken) engine to take apart.  i figure if i can do it once, the
second time for real would be a little better.

well, that's it.  thanks everyone for you opinions and advice.  take
care all!!!!
