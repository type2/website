Subject:       '57 23-Window for Sale in Utah

Howdy folks!

NO, IT'S NOT MY BUS!  

I found an ad for a '57 23-Window for sale in the local paper today 
for the bargain basement price of $8,995.  &lt;cough, cough&gt;  The ad 
claims a &quot;beautiful restoration&quot;

Anyhow, I thought what are the odds that someone else around here has 
a '57 Samba like me??  Anyhow I intend to go see it and will report 
to the list (probably a Friday topic).

If anyone is interested in throwing their money around and supporting 
the economy (of some crazy seller) I'll get you the phone number.
