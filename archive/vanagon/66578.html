Chris,
You asked why I choose 5-50 synthetic oil, understand I'm not an expert
in anything (well...almost).  My understanding is that the synthetic oils
have been engineered so well as to give excellent protection in the full
range, something the mineral oils cannot do. So you have cold start
capability and protection at any temp. I'm sure one of our many well
educated list members can give a better explanation and I would like to
have it laid out in better detail.

Now I'm not trying to be a smart-ass, but do you really have only seven
thousand miles on your Westy? Please don't be offended if it was a
mistake, I understand. I make mistakes also. Many of you may remember the
&quot;bear hand&quot; ordeal I caused!!  : )  : )
