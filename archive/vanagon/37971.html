Ok, I have let me bother this long enough.  I have a '71 campmobile.  
The previous owner installed 185/75 passenger car tires.  At an 
indicated 72mph the bus travels at 56.  The speedo used to bounce 
until I lubed it.  Now it works smoothly throughout its range.  So, do
I have the wrong size tires, a goofy speedo or both?  Mostly, I am 
interested in getting the proper size tire on there.  I want my engine
turning the speed the factory intended.  Thanks, Jim
