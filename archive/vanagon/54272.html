i really want is a 71 std bus with sunroof or a 71 panel van. must be rust

&gt;p.s. i also have a 1900cc water boxer i bought for 175.00 that i was told
it ran but i dont know. i found out it was a 1900 after i bought it used and
i had no use for it. so 175.00 takes it. it also has an alt. still on it.i
havent played with it to find out anything but as it sits it doesnt turn over.
