UGH! Lon, This is HORRIBLE.

Notice how much trouble VW and air filter manufacturers go to, to seal out
dust, and make sure ALL of the air going into the motor is clean? That's 'cuz
all dirt is an abrasive. Having this EGR tube open and sucking in dust
directly from behind your tire is wearing out your motor. : (

 Questions:
 1) should I just leave the set up as it is for now, with the egr intake
 open?(it has been running this way for at least 30K, with no apparent ill
 effects.

Maybe you can't SEE the effects, but this dust sucking-tube will eventually
send your motor to heaven to be with Jesus and the litlle lambs.

 2) should I just block it off?

You know the answer to that. I would suggest mixing up about a half a tube of
JB WELD and shoving this up the tube, held in by a little tape. If you think
you will later install EGR stuff (good for our air), a machine shop can make
a little block-off for you.

 3) if (2) what effects will it have (if any?)

You may have to adjust the idle. I would also remove the little linkage that
runs between the throttle body and the actual EGR valve so that the EGR isn't
even opening and closing.

Good question!!!
