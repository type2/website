&gt; I hav an '88 watercooled Vanagon (which I love) - the body is in
&gt; super shape
&gt; but the engine has had it. I'm thinking of transplanting a V6 or
&gt; larger into
&gt; it. Could you put me in touch with anyone who has done this? Any
&gt; advice
&gt; appreciated.

Point your web browser at:

gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/00/Miscellaneous/Vanagon/Files/Porsche-6-
in-Vanagon-Installation

for William Kennedy's (kennedy_at_admin.njit_dot_edu) description of installing 
a Porsche engine in a bus.  He also posted a FS notice to this list just 
recently (re: six cylinders, no waiting) advertising a 911 engine for 
$1000 as well as a flywheel adapter kit.  If you decide to go for it, be 
sure to keep your listmates apprised of your progress ;)
