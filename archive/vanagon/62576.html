Subject: Replacing the seal on luggage rack

I have just installed the new rubber seal on the top and luggage rack of my
camper.  Does anyone know a trick to keep from pushing the four rear bolts
on the luggage rack back into the top when trying to align the luggage rack
while bolting it back on?  I just don't want to take out the headliner if
there is any other way to do it.  HELP!

I couldn't believe all of the trash that was between the luggage rack and
the top of the camper!  It appears that anything that washes through the
four drain holes gets trapped between the luggage rack and top.  There is
no way out!  Has anyone else run into this problem?  I'm thinking about
putting tape over the holes or putting a screen in the holes.

While I'm on the subject, does anyone know a source for the metal tie down
fittings on the top of the luggage rack?  Mine are quite rusted and I would
like to replace them.

Thanks in advance (again).  Everyone has been so nice to help me get the
old camper back on the road again.  The next project will be the engine.
