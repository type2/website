Tim, that's crazy!  You need to lift the whole front end (not one side at a
time) to bleed the coolant system per the bentley.  Place a 4&quot;x4&quot; piece of
wood about 3' long side to side approximately between the front wheels.  I
don't know what to call the pieces there, but it's the area where the
suspension mounts to the body.  Definitely BEHIND the spare tire holder.
 Actually, you'll place the 4x4 on the jack and then roll them into place.

Place the Jack in the center under the of the 4x4 and jack carefully.
 Remember to NEVER go under a jacked car without a jackstand supporting it.
