ok ok, i'll play, it is friday and all,

	i, that would really be we, sleep whichever way is slanted up
depending on where/how we park.  i don't know about the rest of you,
but we end up in some pretty strange places, and sometimes at some
strange angles.  one neat &quot;trick&quot; we found was to take the extra
cushion from the the top pop-up bed and place it at the back hatch, it
works great as an insulator,  keeps those feet or heads noticabley
warmer when it's cool.  also the 'headbanging' peice of wood can get
in the way if your goofing around, so i guess given a flat surface we
sleep with our heads twords the front.

have a good weekend all!  anyone else going to be sleeping in their
bus besides us this weekend?   ahhh, home away from home!  if it
weren't for the wee one on the way, it probably would be.  and you
know, relatively  soon it will be, but that's a different story:)
