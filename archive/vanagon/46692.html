Brian,

Swapping engines is seldom allowed under California's ridiculous smog laws,
which pays less attention to the actual emissions and more to the
'as-original-condition' of the engine.  But there is an interesting
loop-hole.  An engine from the same manufacturer and of the same OR LATER
vintage, may be used as a replacement.  There is some paperwork required but
paperwork is what keeps all those people happy.

This means that In some cases a properly built Type I engine, probably of
1776cc displacement, would make a suitable -- and far less expensive --
replacement for the Type IV.  

The difficulty in this swap is in properly sealing the engine compartment, as
you've noted in your message.  And since you have a vehicle that came from
the factory with the proper tin-ware, the information contained in your
vehicle -- meaning the shape and number of the tin-ware used to seal the
engine compartment -- would be of critical value to anyone wishing to
undertake this swap.

I urge you to locate drawings of your tin-ware, or to make them yourself if
possible, with the object of getting them into the archives.

If we can develop an 'Late Bus to Early Engine Conversion Manual' covering
the fabrication of the needed parts, wiring changes and adminstrative
procedures, it would serve to keep a lot more late buses on the road, since
it is the high cost of replacing the Type IV engine that so often tips the
scales between keeping or junking the vehicle.
