I looked around last weekend here in Indianapolis for that stuff.  Most places
just kind of scratched their heads and tried to sell me fairly bogus stuff
(vacuum hose, fuel line, heater hose, etc.).  One place could order it for
$5-something a foot.  Another tried selling me this stuff that was SUPER
thick hydraulic line like for a bulldozer.  I ended up getting the right stuff
from a place that specializes in power brake systems.  It seems to be exactly
the right size (just under 1/2&quot;), and they just shrugged and said $3 for the
6' I wanted.  (Got there at closing on a Fri. :-) )  I'd look in the phone
book for a similar place where you live.
