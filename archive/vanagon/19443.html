&gt; &gt;&gt;Does anyone have A/C?
&gt; 
&gt; Ah yes, the old hair conditioner, I mean air conditioner.  My '90 was so
&gt; equipped, and it's a pretty good system.  It puts out enough cold air to
&gt; nearly freeze the inside of the vehicle; I sometimes wondered if the system
&gt; 
&gt; Ryan
&gt; 
Well, Ryan's '90 might but on our '86 A/C was always a sore point,
it did seem to periodically loose R12, plus was never ever sufficient
to cool the darkly painted (Wolfram grey metallic), even if topped off
it was OK in cooler summer weather (75-80) but above 85 you might just
have rolled down the windows and prayed for a breeze, something you
were accustomed to from driving a Bus anyway.
There were a couple A/C related TSB's or maybe even recalls, I remember
we had the system rebuilt free at least 2 times but it still never
did work for shit or quit leaking, a real problem now that you can't
run down to AutoZone and get a $3 can of R12 to fill it.  I do think
they redesigned the system after '88 or so, started putting that weird
vent on the end of the drivers side rear window, so if you strive for
good A/C look for one of those.  Oh, BTW I was always told that the
pre '85 systems with the unit behind the front passengers heads was
even more pitiful than the '86-? but don't know for sure.
