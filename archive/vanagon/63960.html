Subject: RE: oil light/buzzer

Hi,

there's your problem, ditch it! permanently. I use dealers, at twice the
cost of Purolator/Fram/etc, but $4 extra over 4 months is pretty cheap
deal. Never had the warning buzzer when wheeling, with water temps high
and rad fan on etc.  on 20W50 oil in summertime.

Under 2000RPM the oil cct. kicks in at near 0.3 bar, about 5PSI, pretty
damn low pressure for a warning to act on.  Above 2000 it's 0.9 bar,
better at 14PSI. but still poor warning.

Anyone want to tell me why my Audi switch kicks in at 1.8bar _at_ &gt;3000RPM,
about 28PSI.  Don't these design groups talk to one another? I'd like
better vanagon warning iff'n I'm relying on an idiot light only.  Time
for a gauge I guess!!

Tim

PS:  for some reason I'm getting a message 'domain is banned' when I
send directly to Juno_dot_com, so can't mail Steve direct?
