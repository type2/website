&gt;  There is a switch between the push rod tubes on the drivers
&gt;side which requires tin removal to access. This is a normally closed switch,
&gt;held open by good oil pressure.  The control circuit ignores this switch
&gt;below 2000 rpm.  The other switch is below the water pump, (impossible to
get
&gt;at). It is normally closed, held open by good oil pressure. This switch is
&gt;used all the time. 

Dennis &amp; all,
The above is not correct about the &quot;normal&quot; position of the 0.9bar switch.

The dynamic oil pressure monitoring system gets inputs from two pressure
switches.  One switch is closed with no oil pressure and opens when oil
pressure rises to about 0.3 bar, called the .3 bar switch.  The .3 bar switch
is located between the left (driver's side) two cylinders.
The other switch is open with no oil pressure and closes when oil pressure
rises to about 0.9 bar, thus called the .9 bar switch.  The .9 bar switch is
located below the water pump &amp; crank pulley, near the oil pump.

I hopes this helps to clarify.
