 Hello Harry,
 
	Whenever I need a battery for any of my cars I get an Interstate 
battery.  They have a good reputation in my home town and lots of people 
buy them just for that.  They are one of the most expensive aftermarket 
batteries avialable though.

	I go to the local Interstate distributer and ask them if they 
have any &quot;Blems.&quot;  These are the scratch and dents of batteries.  They 
sell them at a reduced price, but they come with the same warranty.  The 
last time I went to get a battery they didn't have my exact type but I 
got the biggest one that would fit in my `73 bus.  The only thing wrong 
with the battery was that one of the terminals had a chunk taken out of 
it.  It works great even thought the terminals are on the wrong side of 
the battery.

	I also had a friend run one down totally (alternator went) and he 
left it on the side of the road.  He told me about it 4 days later and I 
picked it up, charged it, and it's running in the bus right now.  I'm not 
sure about how long it will last, but it was free.
