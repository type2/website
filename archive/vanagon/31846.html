Subject: Shocks for '80 V6anagon


Anyone have a favorite brand/model of shock absorber for a Vanagon? The
ones on my '80 V6anagon look ancient, and it has sort of a dipsy-doodle
ride over any bumps or uneven roads, tho it cruises like a flying carpet
on smooth freeways. It also shakes and shivers after a bump-- a condition
I once noticed on an old Saab Turbo, which was cured when I replaced
the shocks.

The &quot;bounce-the-fender&quot; test isn't always reliable, and not just because
Vanagons don't have fenders. That old Saab always rose right back up to
its original position after you shoved down hard on a fender, with no
bouncing at all. But it still shivered badly after bumps, and replacing
the shocks turned out to be the problem after all.

The V6anagon bounces slightly, once, before settling back-- not a bad
performance if you ask me. But with the other symptoms, I have decided
to do the shocks anyway. I also occasionally hear a heavy clonking from
the front wheels when hitting a bump-- something I recognize from an old
Ford E300 van, whose shocks were found to be almost falling off.


Possibilities include Koni (Gas-a-just rear, GR2 front), or Bilstein if
they make them for this car, or Monroe Gas-Magnum, or Gabriel. Sears
distributes the Gabriels, at about half the cost ($16.99 ea) of the Konis
or Monroes (~$35 each). If they are a decent shock, I'm inclined to go
with the Gabriels. All these shocks have lifetime warranties.

Anyone had any good/bad experiences with these, or with other brands
you'd like to recommend?

TIA,
