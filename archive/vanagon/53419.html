Subject: Westie Syncro prices ?????


Happy holidays to all.......

A friend of mine, not on the list, is looking at a couple 87 syncro westies 
in MD.  Not one, but TWO.  Anyway, he wants to know what some real world 
prices have been paid or asked for them.  If you have seen prices for syncro 
westies recently, please send me a message with the details, including where 
(just city) you live as location affects the prices for these vehicles 
greatly.

please respond directly, I am not recieving daily list correspondance.

thanks,
Fred porter
