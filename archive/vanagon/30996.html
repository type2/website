If I retard the timing, it runs pretty rough. I haven't tried increasing 
the idle while retarding the timing, but it runs faster and smoother 
with the timing advanced.  Does this give any clues?  I think I just 
need some rings and a valve job..... Of course, that's not likely to 
happens soon, but it's going to have to happen.  :-(  Meanwhile, it'd be 
nice to get the thing to pass emissions.


The #1 cylinder is very weak (determinied by pulling the plug whre while
it's running).
