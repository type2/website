&gt; well ... shoot. ol Ric and Pete are gonna eat this one up. but i'm big
&gt; enough to admit that there are folks out there for whom Eurovans are fine. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; such is the case in the November issue of Car and Driver ... in an article
&gt; about their 12 picked C/D editors, each was asked to pick the car, any car,
&gt; he wished. BUT! there's some gotchas!
&gt; say WHAT!!???????
&gt; Volkswagen EuroVan GL.........................  $23,235
&gt; 
&gt;   But why the VW?  The feeble-powered VW?  Hey, we're talking a utilitarian
&gt; cargo hauler here, so what does it matter?  Truth is, I don't find any of the
&gt; minivans so whippet-quick or so heartwarmingly crisp of response that the
&gt; driving iteself is particularly enthralling.  The point is to carry stuff.
&gt; And for that, a big boxy stuff-carrier is what you want.

	I agree with the C&amp;D guy.

	If I had a need to haul many bipeds and/or stuff, I'd buy a Eurovan
	(Urinevan) MV with the Weekender Package (Poptop, Aux. Battery, 
	little lectric fridge, mid-van table). It fits nicely between the
	campers, both Vanagon &amp; Urinevan, and the cul-de-sac marketed
	Winstars, Caravans, Previas etc..
