Can someone clue me in on what a &quot;type II&quot; is ?

I suspect that there are &quot;body type I, II, III...&quot; and
&quot;engine type I, II, III, IV, ...&quot;.

I can see that I have to build a table of engine types versus model
years to keep this straight. &quot;I am only an egg.&quot;

I think the original distiction was between the &quot;small window Bug = type I&quot;
body, and &quot;Split screen breadbox = type II&quot; body. But there seem to be many
more variations to account for.
