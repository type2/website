Maggie,

Fred's Garage in Redwood City is unbeatable.  I know, the name might make 
one wonder, but they positively rule over any mechanic I have ever had 
for any car, period.  They are all German trained mechanics, work on 
nothing but VW's and Audi's and only charge about $30. per hour.  They 
treat you like a human being and are scruptiously honest.  Very few 
services that I have paid for inspire the loyalty I feel for Fred's.  I 
found them when I lived in SF and still go there living in SC.  Just the 
money one saves makes the drive worth it.  Tell them that Charles from 
Santa Cruz with the green Westy sent you if you go.  
Coincidentally, I had been planning on calling them to see if 
they would install a mechanical oil gauge for me, I don't know if they do 
aftermarket addons such as this or the other gauges you mentioned, but if 
you find out please post it.  I don't have one of their cards with me to 
give you the number, but I'm sure information would have it.  If you 
can't find it, e-mail me and I will send it to you.

Good luck,

Charles
