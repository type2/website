Ignore the previous blank. I hate it when I mistype...

&gt; &gt; Here's a little mystery.  Otto, the 79 Bus (50,000 on a rebuilt 2000,
&gt; &gt; 161,000 mi. total, completely stock) has, for reasons known only unto
&gt; &gt; himself, started getting getting 19-20 MPG in combined driving, and 21-23 on
&gt; &gt; the highway.  This has been consistent now for over a month.  
&gt; &gt; What's the collective wisdom?

&gt; Hmm.. well, do you live in an area that is required to have oxygenated 
&gt; gasoline for the winter months?  I found that I get 4ish mpg less than 
&gt; regular gasoline with the stuff.  If so, that could be the cause.  Does 
&gt; your gas station sell an ethanol/whatever mix?   Did you switch gas stations?

Another is that mileage will decrease if it's been a long time since a
tune-up. My mileage on my '89 Vanagon decreased and then shot skyward
when I finally got a tune-up after 5 years and 40,000 miles.

When you use a van only on occasional weekends, you don't think about
some of the time-limit based maintenance items occasionally.
