&gt;&quot;I hope people don't judge me based on one example of my behavior,&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The one example of Steve's behavior I find annoying is his CONTINUOUS
&gt;reference to 6, count them, VI, SIX, &lt;puts on little  girl's voice&gt; SEE --
&gt;ICKS, cylinders. I have always been attracted to the character and
&gt;personality of VW's not their cylinder endowment. More power to ya Stevo

&gt;        Yeah, as the French say, more than a cupful is a waste... Guess the
&gt;Germans agreed...   ;-) But Steve is a true American (Californian, yet) and
&gt;want's 'em bigger... Hence the visit to the equivalent of the plastic
&gt;surgeon for the ol' enlargement...   ;-) ;-) ;-)

&gt;        &lt;now donning flame retardent gear&gt;

&gt;Peace,
