&gt;I'm having a difficult time getting into 1st (not ultra-low) from neutral in
&gt;my '87 Syncro. This makes town driving difficult, since I am using ultra-low

check the bolts holding the plate at the bottom of the gearshift lever. if
these are loose or improperly adjusted, it can be difficult to engage first
gear. you might even want to loosen them and make small adjustment one way
or the other and see if that helps. also check the linkage from underneath
... lower the spare tire and crawl up in there. ;)
