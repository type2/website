&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I agree.  I was bit miffed at first, but my '86 Syncro is every bit (and
&gt; more) a piece of my '71.

Well, I don't agree. My '91 Westie is a wonderful vehicle, but it will
never have the spirit and personality of my '66 kombi, or my ex-'69
kombi, for that matter. When you mention &quot;(and more)&quot;, that's where I
think the issue is. Vanagons lost the beauty of simplicity. I do
recognize that some things never change, and that despite all those
extra gadgets, the Westie still looses more momentum than most cars on
those uphills...(Yes, 2.1L, FI, etc. etc., and I am still there in the
right lane, with the 18 wheelers) Not that I mind it, of course.
In fact, being such different vehicles has forced me to keep
both.(Tough!) I can't replace one for the other. I guess I agree with
the hard-line split window purists on this one.
Later,
Cris.

P.S:
&gt; &gt; Perhaps I've become a bit of a Yuppie, but I doubt that I'd really love a
&gt; &gt; split as anything other than a collector's item now -
You do sound like one! A split can be a perfect everyday vehicle.  Some
of us are planning to go to Tierra del Fuego with one. I feel they are
far more reliable than Vanagons, for one thing.
 - VW made way too many
&gt; &gt; improvments over time.
Like the watercooled heads?..

Am I going to be blacklisted in this list now? :)
Bye again,
Cris.
