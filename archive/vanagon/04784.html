&gt;Yes, I've got TWO ham radios in my camper!  I'll describe the installations
&gt;here for anyone else that might be interested.
&gt;
.._dot_description of two radios deleted for brevity...
&gt;
&gt;As for the antenna installations, I am a big believer in permanent installations,
&gt;i.e., drilling holes. Permanent antennas always outperform thru-the-window
&gt;antennas and magnetic mount antennas scratch the body finish. (Not that
&gt;there's any place to put a magmount on a camper!) 

I found a great place for the magnetic mount antenna with a CB.
The antenna cable was run up the piller behind the cab door, along
the roof inside the pop-top tent and out onto the luggage rack area.
It's a large 'flat' area of sheet metal and I don't care if it gets 
scratched a little.
When I am about to enter a low vert. clearance area (parking garage)
I just step up on the bumper, tip the antenna on it's side and drive.
Performance is acceptable, but a hard mounted antenna is best.  YMMV.
