&gt;Ya but monitor rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled for a while.  There
&gt;is no community feeling.
&gt;Of course if we start a group and all of us switched to it
&gt;then there would be a  community
&gt;feeling for a while but it would degrade with time.

I don't really think that's a fair comparison.  the vw groups became
a wasteland when they started warring.  Also, in my eyes, a moderated group is
more akin to a listserv as it would protect the list from the heaps
of spam many groups get.

&gt;Also look at all the CR*P that gets posted to this group (and all others).

&gt;Call 1-900-FREE-SEX for the hottest...
&gt;Make $30000 in 20 minutes using nothing but....
&gt;Is the Hummer a true 4x4 or does the Jeep Gr.....
&gt;I am a 17 year old male in the LA area looking....
&gt;This garbage has increased over the past few years and will only get worse.

Not all the groups have this problem.  Many have a slight spam
problem and true, some have a huge problem.  Many of these concerns can be
addressed upon formation of the group and the cfd.


Again, no answer to me seems perfect.  I just hate to think about
fragmenting.  It has been great to access mechanical talent, sources,
owner problems and more.
