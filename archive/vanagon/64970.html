Rick,

You might want to check out the Camping World catalogue (or the store in
Tacoma, WA).  No personal experience with this stuff, but I did notice
that a recent catalog featured several solar array systems for RV's,
along with some pretty sophisticated power management devices.  My guess
is that any system manufacturered for general RV use would adapt fairly
readily to a Vanagon/Eurovan application, w/ or w/o dual batteries.

&gt;
&gt; i've been doing a little reading of &quot;Home Power&quot; magazine lately and I'm
&gt; wondering about the design of a solar system to recharge the batteries.
&gt; any one with experience in this area? My main concern is the interaction
&gt; with the dual-battery solenoid and the existing charger - it would be
&gt; nice to have the whole system wired together to get electrons from solar
&gt; and/or alternator.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; another thing i was noting was the use of some sophisticated metering
&gt; equipment to monitor actual amp-hours available in a battery and its true
&gt; voltage. one brand is called &quot;E-meter&quot; from a seattle company named
&gt; &quot;Cruising Equipment&quot; which I presume reflects  its maritime origins.
&gt; Anyone familiar with the use of these? It may be overkill at approx
&gt; US$200 but it may give you that accuracy that the LEDs lack!
