&gt;Eventually you'll have to replace the CV joints.  Try TRANSFORM (in Long

I found a VW service bulletin on one of the web sites that says dried grease
will cause the clicking. Of course if you are going to take it apart to
really clean it and it's not dried grease you will have to do it again.

You might try this address for what seems to be good prices on a CV joint

Good luck,
