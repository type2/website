Subject: Westfalia Propane Leaks

On my friend's 87 Vanagon Westfalia there is a propane leak coming out of a
tiny hole in the box just left of the main valve.  What is the purpose of
the box?  Is the hole part of a relief valve or does the box have to be
replaced? 
 
Where can I get spare parts for the propane system?  Is there a good place
to get this fixed in the San Francisco Bay area? 
 
Walter
