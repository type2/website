Subject: How to remover pistons from wasserboxer?

I am new to the list and I am rebuilding an engine in a 84 vanagon 
(wasserboxer). 

I have the engine cases unbolted but can't see how to get the pistons or 
rods out to seperate the cases. If this involves removing the piston 
pins, what is the best way to get very dirty pins out?

What is a good source for parts for this engine? Is there anything else 
I need to watch out for?

TIA,

Fred Mill
