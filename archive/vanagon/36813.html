Subject: [T1] Shifter couplings...

Finally discovered why The Bozobus was having so much trouble going into
the left side of the gear pattern (1,2 &amp; R)...

The rear shifter coupling had lost all of the rubber inside of it.  The
&quot;can&quot; around the rubber was still intact but there must be 30 degrees of
slop before metal parts contact each other.  Since one of the square-drive
bolts is broken off and I didn't have a spare handy I kluged it with
mechanic's wire and it should hold until I forget that I need to be
gentle...

Question:  Can anyone think of a reason *not* to remove the coupling, clean
it thoroughly and then squirt in enough clear RTV silicone sealant to fill
it?  It might be a little more pliable than the original black rubber
stuff, but it ought to work, unless anyone out there can tell me of
something in-the-bottom-of-a-'60 that will rot out the sealant...
