Subject: My new '91 Westie update

Thanks to everyone that responded to my last week inagural posting. It
seems that the water leak was not a head leak, but a &quot;fitting&quot; that can
be easily replaced, which is why the mechanic estimated only $70. After
doing some searching in the list, I think he was talking about a plastic
flange w/rubber o-ring that should be replaced with a metal one that
comes with a gasket, but I'm not sure because he never had a chance to
show me the location. Anyway, I am going to have the whole coolant
system checked at the local dealership, but it doesn't sound like a
major (head) issue.(I can breathe normally now...) The only symptom is
that the coolant container's level is gradually going down. 
	Its been a month since I bought the Westie, and I am still overwhelmed
by what a great vehicle it is! I don't think I would change it for
anything else in the market today. I must confess I have said the same
about my faithful '66 kombi, but as one gets older a little bit of
comfort and speed (not too much of the latter) are welcome. Anyway, I
needed to express my feelings about my new vehicle and the list sounds
like the perfect place to do so, since my wife is pretty tired of my VW
comments!
Some loose items that I would like to address:
1)I've read about a weekend camping trip being organized in the East
Coast, and I'm wondering if there is any quorum to do the same here in
the Northwest. This is definitely the right area to do it, so we can't
loose.(unless it rains, which it does ...)any takers please contact me
or post in the list.
2)The best driving experience I've had so far has been a trip from Santa
Cruz, CA. to Buenos Aires, Argentina (where I am originally from). Me
and 5 others travelled in a '75 Dodge Van along the Pacific coast for 6
months, and I could talk about the trip for ever... Anyway, an idea I
always keep alive is to do the same with a VW. I always thought-and
still do-that the best VW for this would be an aircooled pre-vanagon
bus. You can find parts for these almost anywhere in Latin America.
However, being in love with my '91 Westie made me wonder how would it be
to do the trip with one of these later beasts. Any comments, questions
or similar experiences?
3)The Westie came with an aluminum running board (step) under the
sliding door that really looks like an &quot;official&quot; accesory. I am not too
interesed in keeping it because it is attached to the car at the jack's
brackets, consequently I am not able to use the jack on the right side.
Also, it limits the clearance from the ground, which can come handy in
case of mud, snow, bad roads, etc. Anyone interested? I don't even know
how much it would cost, but I guess I could find out. Believe me, it
looks very nice and serves its purpose.
4)As a result of the mentioned running board, the ex-owner took the mud
flap that goes behind the front/passenger tire. Where can I get one?
5)Finally, I should clarify that Barbara's name (my wife) shows up on my
messages because I am using her e-mail account, but it is me (Cris)the
one who you are reading from. By the way, is there a way to send the
list's postings to a special folder? Barbara hates to have to go through
them while looking for hers...
	Sorry for the length. I could keep writing for a long time, but for now
this will do...Cheers,
Cris.
