Subject: more on tires/pressures
Date: Tue, 25 Feb 97 15:40:10 EST

Hey all,
Since we're on the subject of tires and proper pressures, I wanted to
ask a question of the tire experts.

On my van I have Michelin XZX tires, size 185 R 14.  All the information
I have is from what's printed on the tire sidewall.  It says Max Load is
1540 lbs at the Max Cold Inflation Pressure of 40 psi.  I can find
nothing on the tire that refers to a load rating (like passenger car or
light truck) but there is a marking that says REINFORCED Radial.  Now, I
assume then, that the Reinforced marking indicates a light
truck/reinforced sidewall tire?  

Also a question regarding the load rating, the 1540 lbs is at the max
pressure.  Now obviously the load rating goes down as the pressure goes
down, but I was curious as to whether the relationship is linear or not?
Probably not, but just checking.  I know mdstockr can help here :-)

In addition, here is the information that I obtained from the tire
pressure sticker in the doorjamb of my 1981 Vanagon Westy.  The
information probably doesn't apply to you unless you have an aircooled
Vanagon Westy.

Tire Size     Pressure, Front (psi)      Pressure, Rear (psi)
---------     ---------------------      --------------------
7.00-14 8 PR         33                          48

185 R 14 C 6 PR      38                          55

185 SR 14 Reinf.     33                          40

I assume by my tires, I should go by the third listing, for the
reinforced tires.  That is the pressure I have them inflated to now, 33
psi front and 40 psi rear.

Could someone decode the tire size/ratings above, mainly the first and
second ones?  What's the PR about, does that mean passenger car tires?

All help appreciated,
Sean
