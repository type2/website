Subject: Tires again !?!

Malcomb said:

&gt;These tires should be fine for a regular Vanagon. I have Michelins
&gt;this size on my GL and they are great. I do not use these on either
&gt;the Kombi or the Westfalia, though. The tires have an 80k warranty
&gt;as well, and the Vanagon was listed by Michelin as applicable for 
&gt;both this size and for the warranty. I run 35lbs in them, the maximum
&gt;I believe.

Malcomb, can you  tell us the exact Michelin tire type you are running?
If its OK with Michelin, I think this is significant, though you'll be
driving the car in those crosswinds, not them. 

I thought this was hands down already decided on this list, at least
twelve times :-)! But here we are again, and if it can save some money,
great.

As per Coyote's Vanagon FAQ I started recommending 205/70 R14 for my
buddies new Carat. This is a family car, the only 

The TireRack, incidently, only comes up with the Michelin MXL 205/70 R14
for the Vanagons with alloy wheels. I fully agree that the wider 205
makes good ride sense on the road, but its the &quot;R14&quot; vice &quot;14&quot; that the
list seems to think is critical. 

Any other opinions out there?
