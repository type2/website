So David Schwarze says:
&gt; Jeff and Linda for the excellent cooking!

Sorry David, but the above excellent cooking kudo's should
also go to Martha and Sara, for they did quite a bit of 
the work!  (great pancakes Sara!)  (Oh, you too Martha)
(and you too Christa! I like mine well done thank you ;) )


I think I also have to apologize for not mentioning Tobin
and Christa in my earlier report.  Sorry about that folks.

See ya,

Steven
