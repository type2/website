Subject:       Re: Tire update on Yokohama Y370G

&gt; So I got the FAQ's, read the web pages, and went looking for some Yokohamas.
&gt; 
&gt; Yokohama (yellow page 800 nbr) said the Y370G is a passenger tire?  is this
&gt; true?
They also make a 370 which is a passenger tire - I thought this was 
the the 370B, but I may be wrong.
Just checked mine - the sidewall says: RADIAL 370 (in large letters). 
Other ways to tell are the size itself: LT195/75R14 (where LT =light 
truck), Max PSI (65) and weight rating (1710 lbs) This tire comes in 
Load range C &amp; D. I got mine (load range D) for ~$108 CDN from BigO 
Tire.

They're not a common tire, but worth seeking out. I would not 
recommend *any* passenger tire on a Vanagon.

&gt; Is there another model number that is equivalent? What am I missing?
Is it confusing - I have a Yokohama flyer which lists both the 370 LT 
and passenger versions - not much difference at first glance.
