&gt; &gt;  a fair price? Is the electric fridge worth the hassle of dealing with 
&gt; 
&gt; That doesn't sound too steep a price but I'd keep looking until I found
&gt; a setup with a fridge that runs on AC/DC/LPG.  I wouldn't want to mess
&gt; with trying to keep the fridge running off of a battery.  Especially
&gt; if you plan to do any extended trips.  

The price doesn't sound that bad to me either, but you could get lucky
and get all of that at a pick and pull place for under $100.  I helped
my ex-roomate outfit his empty 73 bus this way.  That fridge is my
least favorite of any that were offered in the Westy.  If you are going
to go to the trouble of converting back to a camper, why not get one of
the later style camper setups with the side-opening 3-way fridge?  Much
nicer, IMO.  Electric only fridges can be great *if* you go to a lot of
trouble upgrading you batteries and drive every couple of days.  For
extended periods parked, propane is probably the way to go.
