&gt;What does the Weekender Package for the 86 van comprise of?
&gt;	Can it sleep 4 people?
&gt;	Does it include the pop top with room for 2 to bunk in?
&gt;	Does the back seat recline into a bed?
&gt;
&gt;

If they're not talking about the std westy, then the weekender package
consists of :

-back seat folds down into a sofabed with a cushion over the engine.
-back of middle seat folds down (split seat)

that's it. 

No poptop.
and only room for 2 people to sleep (comfortably, that is...)
