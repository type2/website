Brendan -

I have been running my 84 Westy (w/87 2.1 engine) this summer traveling
all over kingdom-come with a 80C Thermostat (It is not the same as Audi
5000) with the needle just to left of the LED and when on hills and in
town (stop &amp; go), just to the right of the LED.  But I agree with Eric to
a point that the Expansion Tank Pressure Cap may be suspect in this case
as well.  Summers here in Redding average at or above the century mark in
temperature and it's been in the 80s and 90s most everywhere else I've
gone.

I sell a lot of these and every customer reporting back has said there
was a definite improvement over what they were experiencing.  One proviso
though - I don't recommend the cooler thermostat for cold weather regions
such as Canada or the Northern USA because it may run too cool for the
engine to properly warm to operating temperature, thus causing the ECU to
send a &quot;too rich&quot; signal to the fuel injectors.

&gt;List,
&gt;
&gt;        I have recently gotten an '87 Westy and have been gleaning
&gt;lots of
&gt;great info from you all.
&gt;
&gt;        Now, I have a question. This van shows lower temps on hotter
&gt;days and
&gt;hotter conditions such as in town. When out on the freeway, the temp
&gt;goes above the led, when I would think it should go down.
&gt;
&gt;        If I pull over after a run on the freeway, with the higher
&gt;temp
&gt;reading, the overflow tank overflows. However, the hoses to and from
&gt;the
&gt;radiator are not hot at all, and the fan is not going.
&gt;
&gt;        In town, on hot days, the rad is nice and warm, the fan
&gt;operates
&gt;occassionally, and the temp is about in the middle of the led.
&gt;
&gt;        This leads me to believe that the air cooling of the engine
&gt;while
&gt;cruising on the freeway leads to a water temp insufficient to keep the
&gt;stock 87C thermostat open. When stopped suddenly, the thermostat
&gt;cannot
&gt;react fast enough to bring the radiator online before the boil-over
&gt;occurs.
&gt;
&gt;        My question is this: Has anyone explored this problem before?
&gt;Has
&gt;anyone put the 80C thermo from the '79 Audi 5000 in? (I did this
&gt;morning, but have yet to test it)
&gt;
&gt;        Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Brendan
