Could some kind soul provide the 'phone and fax  numbers (and email 
address?) for West Coast Metric.

Their VW products are sold in the UK but by the time they get to the 
end-users, quite a few hefty margins have been added. eg the Westfalia roof 
seal retails at around 80 pounds sterling - say $125.

I'm hoping that they will supply direct, and cheaper.
