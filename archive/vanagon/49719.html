Subject: Buzzing when accelerating

Hi Guys,

My 86 GL make a buzzing noise that I hear somewhaere near the engine when I
accelerate onto the highway or when I really give her some gas.  There is
no noticable performance problem.  It sounds like an insect buzzing againt
a window. I wonder if it's the fuel pump working hard or maybe the sound of
the fuel injector control (first time I've had FI).

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks
