Subject: high speeds

Hell.  Now I have to go out and lose my license proving that a six-cylinder
Vanagon is faster than a four.  Low eighties is all I've done so far.  My
cheap little tach goes crazy over 4500rpm and it was all over the map.

Relatedly, does it seem to anyone else that East Coast speeds are rising, on
average.  We went up to Saratoga and back this weekend, and the speed du jour
seemed to be 78 or so.
