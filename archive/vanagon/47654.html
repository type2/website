Subject:       1969 camper needs good home

I have a 1969 camper, which has just been replaced as the primary 
vehicle in our family by a 1990 Westfalia.  I love them both, but 
down here in the south, we just have to have the ac -- so the '69 is 
sitting in the back yard, waiting for a new life.  This bus is in 
pretty good shape -- we had the body completely restored in 1989, 
with rust-inhibiting undercoating, etc., before we moved to NY.  Even 
so, though, the rust got to it over the 6 years we were there, and so 
the lower edges of the body are somewhat unsightly, and the sliding 
door is having problems.  The engine is new (not rebuilt), and has 
less than 10,000 miles on it.  The transmission (rebuilt) has a 
couple thousand miles more than the engine.  The interior is in good 
shape, and overall, it's a very sweet bus.  I need to sell it, but I 
really want to find it a good home, rather than part it out.  I've 
placed a few 'classifieds' on the net, but since most of those lists 
have no dates, it's hard to tell how active they are.  I'm looking 
for suggestions (or buyers?) as to how best to get the word out:  the 
bus has lots of potential, but will need some immediate body 
attention.  Asking price is $1000 -- which would hopefully leave 
someone with enough money budgeted to get some of the body work done.
  
I'd appreciate any advice any of you can give me.
