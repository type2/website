Yes, me too.  That's an expensive starter, isn't it?  Should I be 
suspicious of burrs on the ring gear, bad ground, and somehow the 
solenoid needing more current to actuate?  Should I clean up the ring 
gear with a file, install a new ground to the starter and buy that extra 
solenoid kit that Berg (I think) sells?
