[lotsa questions deleted, unfortunately I know nothing about driving in
Mexico]

&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, enough for now.  Much mahalo for any responses.
&gt; I'll post my mild (hopefully) adventure when I return (if ever, surf could
&gt; be epic).
&gt;

*whine* *whimper*  Can I come too?  Can I?  Can I? *whine*  Please post your 
trip adventures, those of us suffering in flat ol' Oregon from surf
and bus road-trip withdrawals are interested in hearing all about them!
