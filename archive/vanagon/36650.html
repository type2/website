&gt;Has anyone replaced the 50W bulb in the square high beam driving 
&gt;lights with a 100W bulb?
&gt;
&gt;any signs of amperage overload on the wiring?
&gt;
&gt;was the light output difference noticable?
&gt;
&gt;do they take an H1 bulb?
&gt;

Wiring will take load but ignition switch and headlight switch will not.  Use
a relay to get more voltage to the lights.  Running additional wiring from
the alternator to the fuse box will reduce the voltage drop on the harness
increasing brightness further.
