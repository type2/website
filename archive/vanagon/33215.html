Subject: Re: Taking care of pop top fiberglass

&gt;Harry, Mark, all - My fiberglass top is not coated, (not counting the corner
&gt;of luggage carrier which PO painted with, like, house paint or something..).
&gt; I want to paint/coat it.  The durned *itchy* fiberglass gets all over me
&gt;when I scrub the top, as I do each spring, because MOLD grows in the hairline
&gt;crevices in the fiberglass, making the top look older and rattier than it
&gt;really is! I want something that'll make a nice smoothe coat and last
&gt;*forever*, not necessarily white either.. we're painting the Pumpkin this
&gt;spring and I may want to co-ordianate w/the paint job.  What have others used
&gt;on their fiberglass?

Ruthie,

The following recommendations have come from the list in the past:  

Those dirty hairline cracks in the top can be cleaned with X-14 brand
mold/mildew remover. Just be sure to wash it all off the top and wash it off
painted surfaces well.

The expensive, but best way to refinish the pop-top is through gel coating.
Boating supply shops will provide info on the cost/materials involved for
this.  I remember there are a couple detailed posts on this in the 95
vanagon archive.  

Busgirl Martha refinished her top using a paint on product called Kool Seal.
As I remember, it takes a little work to spread this evenly without leaving
brush marks and it leaves a rubberized texture after drying, but I believe
she said it looked good.  How's it been holding up, Martha?

Good luck,




Ron
