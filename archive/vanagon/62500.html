Subject: Thule roof racks for Westie-Help?

Just purchased Thule racks for my Westfalia. The parts list says that
the No. 300 raingutter foot pack fits this vehicle. Too bad I didn't
open the box at the REI store.  When I opened the box at home it was
obvious they were too short to clear the roof. I immediatly went out to
the vehicle to confirm it. Does anybody know what's up?
Anybody have Thule racks that fit the Westie? The folks at the REI store
don't seem to have a clue. On the other hand maybe I'm not very bright
either and can't figure out how they are supposed to work.

							1984 Westfalia in Michigan
