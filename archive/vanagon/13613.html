&gt;  I was just now changing the oil in my '74, getting it ready for the trek
&gt;  to Red Rock. I took off the sump and strainer and there are PIECES OF
&gt;  METAL IN IT!!!! Bunches of them, mostly small, roughly 2 mm in diameter,
&gt;  but some are larger, about 6mm by 3mm, bent and sharp. They are all very
&gt;  shiny and they are not magnetic. I'm guessing it is the aluminum timing
&gt;  gear on the camshaft.

If I'm not mistaken, the gear on the camshaft is brass.  My guess is that
they are pieces of the case.  Could just be burrs that broke off.  Then
again, they could be pieces of piston.  :(

&gt;  I think I'm going to cry. Looks like I'll be spending the Red Rock Weekend
&gt;  taking my engine out.

Hmmm... I hope not.  OTOH, I can't sit here and tell you to drive it to
Red Rock, just cause I want a good turnout.  :)

&gt;  Other bits of evidence for the engine detectives out there: 108,000 miles
&gt;  on this engine &lt;guess I got my money's worth&gt;, valves adjusted &lt;1000 miles
&gt;  ago and only one was out by .001. Good power and running smoothly. No
&gt;  big unusual noises &lt;yet?&gt;

When was the last time you took off the oil sump strainer?  I don't think
I have removed mine in 20k miles since the engine was rebuilt.  That's
bad, huh?  I do change my oil every 1500 miles or so, though.  Sorry
to hear about the trouble, and please let me know if you are for sure
not going to make it to Red Rock...
