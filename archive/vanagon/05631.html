Ha, I talked to the guys at Vantastics and they said they have been swamped
with calls today, all from people who heard about them from the internet!
They are sending me the brochure...

I mentioned Jerry Huff's name and they said that Jerry will be &quot;well taken
care of&quot;.  This sounded like a good thing, not a bad thing :-)
