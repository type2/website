Yes, -  BUT -- , fuel injection lines are under around 35 psi pressure in a
Bosch  FI system.  While this should pose no problem for the metal lines and
fuel manifolds,  the rubber hoses in between are subject to the same
pressures, and engine compartment heat - so they will eventually dry out,
harden and be subject to failure, at 35 PSI !!!  Keep a periodic eye on those
fuel lines and replace with the proper High Pressure fuel line !
