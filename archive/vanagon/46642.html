&gt; not quite, the diesel engine oil filter is larger than the gas engine oil

I *did* say *4 cyl gas* engines...;-) The diesel of course is 
larger, although it will fit on some gas engines. Curious that they 
would change the filter for the EV since vw's used this filter for 
over 20 yrs now. Is the EV a unique filter? How about the VR6?
Incidentally, the G60 filter on my Corrado was only different because 
it had a hex nut on the bottom to ease removal in the tight confines. 
Otherwise, a standard filter fits. (but is a *devil* to remove.)

I've also heard some people use the diesel filter on older A1 cars to 
add an extra 1/2 qt oil capacity &amp; supposedly better flow. With 
larger oil pans on the A2s I don't think this is a factor.
