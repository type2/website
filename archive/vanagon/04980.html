Subject: Re: US License plate fetish


I don't have a problem with this &quot;fetish&quot; .. in fact I suffer from
a similar fate...all my cars have German plates on them...the
real ones...I have a friend who has a cousin who lives outside
of Munich who works for the post-office and he gets the
old plates on cars of those people who move to another 
city...anyway he has to &quot;certify&quot; the destruction of the plates...
sending them to me is one way of &quot;destroying&quot; them I guess...

Foreign licence plates are like that old saying &quot;You always want
what you cant have&quot;...
