i'm down to my last few ounces from a one gallon container.  Kroil.  do a
search of Usenet and you'll find it mentioned with some frequency on lists
such as rec.tech.steamengines or some such thing.  so named because it is an
'oil that creeps'.... Cre-oil.. Kroil or so the urban legend goes.

Kroil is a good penetrating oil.  it is not a miracle maker.  it is better
than Liquid Wench because it is red in color.  i like colored oils and
greases.  i buy Kendall grease because it is blue.  but seriously, it is a
good product but still must be used with heat, time, and prayer.  and i have
had several instances where i have had to pay the piper when the fitting
snapped, even after employing all the aforementioned.  but i haven't tried
live sacrifices. yet.

look for the various package 'Deals' they promote where they combine a bunch
of their different products for a lump price.  and they usually throw in a
pump oiler.  enjoy the 1950's style testamonials they send with the product
but keep a jaundiced eye.

and oh.  it smells.  strongly.  spill a drop on the interior of your van and
you'll enjoy its aroma for days.  and your spouse will too.  :(

-dan or rocko or whoever the heck i am.
