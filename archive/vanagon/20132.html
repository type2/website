Subject: Rear Bumper Needed for Vanagon

I am in need of a rear bumper for an 87 vanagon (syncro - if that matters).
 A pesky traffic pole came out of nowhere and hit the back side of my van.
 The bumper is bent in.  I figure I can save myself the costs of a bodyshop
by just replacing the bumper myself.  I don't want to send it through my
insurance company as I dont think that they will believe that it was the
traffic pole's fault.  

If anybody knows what years would fit on the 87 that would be helpful info to
know.  I assume that the bumper can be wrapped up and UPS'ed here.  

Any thoughts are always appreciated from this august body.

yours very truly
