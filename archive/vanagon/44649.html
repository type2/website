Subject: gas tank...

with the purchase of the stuff from the '67 westy last week was 
a second gas tank... no big deal, except it has a small petcock with a 
lever on it, 'bout 3&quot;-4&quot; of stiff wire to the lever. 

	The Local Bus Gurus have never seen one before... one thinks 
that it may be from an early Barndoor..

	any ideas out there???

		tank is in very good condition, seems too be just a 
small amount of flake rust inside, no rust outside...

	maybe could be used as an aux tank, was also thinking of 
building an engine test stand... could just strap this too the top of 
the frame... looks nicer than a tube in a red plastic gas can...   &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

	any info will be welcomed...
