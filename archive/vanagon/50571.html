Subject: Valve Propane Tank

OK.... I have to have at least a new fill valve on my '85 camper.  Is 
this a part that is available at any gas bottle supplier or is it one of 
those dreaded OEM things?  Is there a source for new tanks that is not 
VW? If so, does anyone know how much? I have 1-1/2 weeks to put this 
thing together before we leave.  Anything I order from the west coast 
will take at least 8 days. Appreciate your suggestions.
