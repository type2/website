Subject: subscribe vanagon

I would very much like to subscribe to the Vanagon mailgroup (
Joneskp_at_ctrvax.Vanderbilt_dot_edu ).
  I recently bought a '87 Vanagon Westy Synchro which I love without
bounds.  I put 5,000 miles on it in the first month I had it (Yes, five
thousand.)  Unfortunately my baby didn't return my love.  It would
mysteriously cut out momentarily (the RPMs would dive one or two thousand)
producing a herky-jerky effect.  This happened rarely and only at highway
speeds under load,  but my nightmare got progressively worse.  Eventually
the van of my dreams became undriveable in Cour-de-laine, Idaho, with the
&quot;problem&quot; occuring non-stop and apparent at all speeds.  My only repair
option was the dealer in town.  Cour-de-laine is not the VW capitol of the
west.  It is very popular with conservatives and retired LAPD.
  I will spare you the details of the horrors visited upon me.  First they
replaced the distributor, and charged me $500, saying the mechanic had test
drove it and it was fixed.  I was not able to drive it out of the parking
lot.  The &quot;problem&quot; was still there at full force.  I ended up replacing
the ECU (the computer) for $1000+.  The problem went into remission.  I
knew it would soon rear its ugly head again.  I could feel it.
   About 200 miles later toward Missoula, the van suddenly lost power going
up a steep mountain grade.  It lost all its power and died in first gear.
I sat there dumbfounded.  The beast had never done this before (and has not
done it since.)  I restarted the car it ran normally up and over the hill.
I have not gone over such a steep pass since.  The original problem has
only returned a few times in the last 1000 miles and has disappered for
long streches of time. I can only pray.
   It seems I have written much more than I expected to.  You probably
don't even read these letters.  If you do I wonder if you can repost it to
the mailgroup (I new to all this, if you can't tell.)  I would love to hear
from anyone who has had this problem or even cares.
