YAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

The balance for my '91 is $0.00!!!!   YYYYEEEESSSSSS!!!!

It's aalllll mine now!!  

No more monthly payments till the next car which will
be some time next year.  Don't know what my wife wants
yet, but I doubt if it will be a VW.  Oh well, as long
as I don't have to work on it too much....  :)

Right now, I've got my eye on a 412 that's going for about
$500.00.  (Martha, you know you want it.... ;)  )

HAAAAPPY CAMPER....INDEED!
