Subject: Re: Roof Racks &amp; Storage

On our Westy, we have a morphedite system: I made rain gutter type
brackets using 1-inch angle and 1/8-inch round stock and mounted them to
the fiberglass roof. This allowed me use the ubiquitous roof system that
I used as a surfer (many moons ago) on which I mounted cross sections of
10-inch pvc pipe that I heated up in the micro and moulded to the hull
of our kayaks. For less than $20 I have a system that carrys two
Aquaterra Prisms. Since these are open tops with waterproof
compartments, and since I carry them right side up, I use the kayaks as
storage for wetsuits, snorkeling gear, paddling gear, and my hammock
from Mulege for the longer trips. I must admit that the &quot;racks&quot; get some
second looks when the kayaks are not on the roof. Kit Carter 85 GL
