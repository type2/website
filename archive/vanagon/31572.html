To All:

The original Piper 'Cub' -- the Taylor E2 -- had a piece of crap for an
engine.  Even so it was a good flyer, with a generous wing, exceptionally
strong fuselage and landing gear. Indeed, it did jobs no other airplane could
do, and continues to do so.  A few people may have scraped the bird because
of the engine but since better engines were available that was like throwing
out the baby with the bath water.  What they did was throw out the crappy
engine.  With a better powerplant the Cub remained in production for nearly
forty years, until it was shot out of the sky by lawyers and insane liability
laws.

The Volkswagen Transporter is the Piper Cub of vans.  Re-engined with a
properly built powerplant, it continues to do things no other van can do, and
do them at less cost.  Unfortunately, that only applies to those Transporters
fitted with upright engines.  The Type IV powerplant is becoming too costly
due to its limited numbers, and from a mechanic's view-point the engines in
the water-cooled vans were never more than a bad joke.  But better engines
are available.

So long as air-cooled Volkswagens remain in production somewhere in the
world, keeping an early van alive will be a snap.  But the cost of owning a
water-cooled van or one having the Type IV engine has been rising steadily.
 Many loyal owners will be forced to abandon their vehicles due to economic
factors.  

Mechanically speaking, the powerplant is only one of the systems that go to
make up a vehicle.  And if you have a bad powerplant it seems logical to
replace it with a better one.  That is the basis for my strong interest in
the Subaru and V6 conversions, with a strong bias toward the V6's because of
their greater availability, lower cost and history of 100,000+ service life.

While the Vanagon List was not created to provide a repository of information
about engine conversions, neither was it designed to poll sleeping positions
or BTU requirements for camping in the snow.  It seems entirely reasonable
that anything which serves to keep our vehicles on the road is a worthy
subject for the list, and to my mind that includes alternative powerplants.

We love our 'bricks' because they fulfill a need.  Installation of a
different engine is a relatively minor point in the overall scheme of things.
 I'm hopeful someone with the necessary resources can create an archive of
engine conversion data so that when the time comes -- as it surely will, even
for the uprights -- we will have alternative powerplants and the necessary
conversion information to keep our vans flying.  er... rolling.
