&gt;Questions, anyone, would my 86 westy operate ok without the cat
&gt;converter?  No emmissons test here. The exhust tips would come closer to
&gt;the center for me if that were the case. Would the tips clear the tow
&gt;hook bumper hitch?

There is one Vanagon exhaust system excluding the CC converter
while replacing it with a straight trough pipe. But this short
pipe, available from VW Germany, will cost DM 120.00, this is
not acceptable. Visit a local muffler shop to get one welded.
