Subject: Re: Which Oil Filter??

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well time has come for the first oil change in the new Vanagon.  I heard a
&gt; &gt;lot of &quot;Don't use Fram filters&quot; while lurking on the list earlier.  The
&gt; &gt;question is what brand can I use?  Is &quot;Genuine VW&quot; the only way to go or is
&gt; &gt;there something else I can use?  All help appreciated.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; I've been using Fram for years and have never had a problem.  A few years
&gt; ago Consumers Reports rated them Very Highly and I've used that as my guide
&gt; for their use.
&gt; 
&gt; So what have been the reported problems with Fram? Why shouldn't one use it?
&gt; 
These are the problems I've seen first hand:

Oil pressure light comes on on both '87 &amp; '88 Vanagons after long 
highway run; same thing on two '85 Jetta diesel &amp; turbo diesels.
On both diesels I noted a difference of 5-10 psi using FRAM vs VW 
filters and 20w50 oil. (hot oil pressure). This is using a mechanical 
OP gauge mounted on cylinder head.

I presume this lower OP is similar on Vanagons, and on older engines 
with more wear (and lower OP) can be enough to trigger the OP warning light.

I feel better with the VW filters, since around here Bosch cost 
*more*.
