Subject: 1.9L pistons

Hey happy campers,
                                I need help locating 4 pistons for a 1.9L
(prefer used and usable). Anyone know were to get sealant AMV 188 001 02 or a
substitute for it?  What is the Curil K2 sealant? Is is the same as the AMV
188 001 02 or D000-40-01 or AKD 456 000 01? Even the VW dealer here is
clueless as I am.  HELP!

                                                          ( Clueless in OK
City)
                                                            Scott Riley
