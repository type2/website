&gt; Unless.......how hard is it to but on new rotors and brake pads?

Easy.

&gt;Can I get good used ones (I wouldnt think so but I'll ask anyhow)? From

No.

&gt;what my mechanic informed me he said new brake pads will be $40/pair,

Sounds a little high.

&gt;rotors will be $200/pair,

Sounds quite high.

&gt;and $100 in labor. I;d like to aviod the later if possible.

Sounds reasonable.

&gt;He said that new tires would cost around #160 each.

Sounds way high.  I'd figure $70 to $100 each tops in USA money.  Adding the
exchange rate still doen't get near $160 each!

Good Luck,
