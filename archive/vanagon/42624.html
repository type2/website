Hey everyone!

I was just wondering if anyone knows where to buy vw vanagon manuals for a
78 westfalia.  I live in Vancouver, BC and would prefer to pick them up
locally.  Do you also know about how much they cost?  Are they any good?  I
already have a Haynes manual, but it seems to skip out a few steps here and
there.

Thanks in adavance
