 Could this be anything but the ECU not properly dealing with the
 signal from the oxygen sensor?  Everyone says don't suspect the ECU
 until you've tried absolutely everything else, I can't guess what else
 it could be.  HELP! &gt;&gt;

Well quit guessin' and start BETTIN' !!!

Now I ain't a gamblin man, but, If'n I were you, I would price an ECU for
your van. THEN price a Bentley Manual and a decent multi-meter, and (maybe) a
vacuume gauge. Spend an afternoon in the garage with your beloved (the van,
that is).

Here's the proposition:

If you are SURE that the ECU can be the only problem, bet your ENTIRE
paycheck on that ECU. If your wrong. you loose $$$ 'cuz electronic parts are
non-refundable.

If you bet on the Bentley/tools you may spend some of that paycheck, with
some $$$  left to stop by Taco Bell. I assure you, you will find the problem,
learn a ton in the process, get some useful tools and a manual, and stand
releived that it was not the ECU...(I played this game with a Porsche 914 and
lost a couple of paychecks)

You make the call.

you betcha,
