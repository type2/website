Subject: Re: Diesel 5 Speeds

Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 
&gt; .Steve Smith (at one time Steve and I were the Vanagon-list's defenders
&gt;                of the bunker burners.....)
&gt; ..had one (with the 5-speed...) He has left the list due to a great 
&gt; job...but if I remember, he said that the lowest gear on the 
&gt; thing was real low, and he didn't use it...What I never could figure
&gt; out was if gear #5 had a higher ratio than #4 on a 4-speed...

Well, in Pittsburgh, one _REALLY_ needs the 'granny-gear' to get rolling
up some of the hills...

I imagine a higher final drive ratio would be cool too (for the OTHER
SIDE of those hills!!!)     ;-)
