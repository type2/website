Subject: Re: Shifter, Mudflaps and the like

Joel,
Thanks for the info on the shifter plate.  As soon as the rain stops,
I'll give it a go.

As for the mudflap - It appears that even if I removed the 'Westie'
stuff and the &quot;wall&quot;,
I still wouldn't be able to get inside.  It looks like my best bet is to
borrow my 6 year old
nephews arm to reach into the piller to hold the fastener down while I
tighten.  If this works
I'll be looking for a passenger side flap.  Any for sale out there?

Does anybody have a list of part numbers for ALL of the coolant, fuel
and vacuum hoses.  This will
be my next adventure.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Until last week-end the van had lost hardly a drop of coolant.  But
after a long, hard drive through
the local canyons and being parked on a slight incline over night, she
spilled
about 1/4 cup of coolant to the ground a little left of center engine. 
I had added a small amount to
the check tank before the venture - about the same amount I lost.
Hmmmm... could the tanks markings be 
incorrect?

Thanks,

Dan
'87 Westie

&gt; &gt;fastener did you use?  How did you reach into the body panel to
&gt; &gt;   hold it in place?
&gt; 
&gt; can't help. i was gonna add those flaps on both sides and could never figure
&gt; out how to secure them to the body. :( wound up selling them. there has to
&gt; be some way ... i'd suggest taking off the &quot;wall&quot; interior panel and seeing
&gt; what you can see from in there.
