&gt;We have sold Repco Metal Master brake pads for 26 years.  Some facts:
&gt;   Repco has changed name to Axxis.  Now available as Lucas GPX and Beck
&gt;Arnley 088's.  Repco (semi metalic) Metal Masters have a life time warranty.
&gt;They don't fade, squeal or dust.  They DO NOT warp rotors.  They are such a
&gt;good pad and impervious to heat that we have many autocrossers using these
&gt;pads.  We have never understood where the hard on rotors reputation came
&gt;from.
&gt;
&gt;

I have had bad experiences with other so called life time pads. Especially on
Vanagons.  The Repco Metal Masters seem to work great. When buying pads for a
Vanaon, I now ensure that they have friction rating of FF or FG.  The Vanagon
is so Under braked, that EE pads feel Dangerous.  They do not stop the Bus.
