So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly I don't own a single VW.  I am looking at buying one that is in town.
&gt; Please advise on:
&gt; 71 camper top bus, has no propane tank under door like I've seen before.
&gt; Has 1 very well siezed motor, 1600 dp rebuilt once, and will need new heads, 
&gt; one has a spark plug hole
&gt; which has been helicioled and blew out.
&gt; Body good, little rust, one ding in door, but small.
&gt; Can anyone ID. the vehicle for me- that is whats the type of camper?
&gt; 
&gt; With the siezed motor the lady wants $650 for it.
&gt; What do Y'all think?
&gt; Chris Bridge.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Since I don't know where you located, the first thing ya look for at this
price is rust.  If there is little or no body/pan rust, it's a steal.
The engine will probably have to be replaced and will cost anywhere from
$700.00 on up to $2K depending on whether you do the work or not and the
quality of the engine.  If it needs a tranny, then add $300 or so.  If it
has evidence of water leaking inside, I'd hesitate to by it at all as I'm
not a body person and there are still plentiful '71's in these parts (Sac-
ramento).  Still $650 is not a bad asking price.  I'd start low with the
seller say $350 and work from there.
