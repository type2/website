Subject: Re: VW theme...thanks for answers to my Syncro ?...and ? for easterners

Most of the icons and cursors in this package are ones that I made
several months ago and tried to post as an attached zipped file to the
list.  I was ignorant of the list servers penchant for binging on
attached graphics files and then purging them in the form of garbage
that takes of much bandwidth.

I hope someone finds a use for them.  It would make being sick on the
Sat. night that I made them worthwhile.

Also, thanks to everyone who answered my question concerning my Syncro
lacking a diff. switch.  I've owned the beast a year already but, since
it is in PA and I am in MD, I have little time to get to know it.  I
don't think I'll bother to try to retrofit the switch as it involves
(AISI) changing the transmission.  My Syncro knows when it needs to use
all of it's feet.

EAST COASTERS:   Are there any plans for a late spring trip such as
occurred last June.  I was new to my Vanagon and trying to quell  some
valve noise so I missed it.  It sounded like a blast and I am interested
in being a part of any that occur this year.  Tom, et al.?
