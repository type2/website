James,

Try the dealer for this, my 79 did not have the timing marks on it, the dealer
has them for about $2.54 each.  I don't have the part # any more, but it is
called &quot;ignition timing scale&quot; or something really close to that.  Chances
are the dealer wont have them in stock, but can get them.

This weekend I had the pleasure of working on two different post '71
buses.  The little marks on the timing bar to the left of the pulley
were gone on both.  One of them had some marks painted on it at some
time in the past so I used those.  The other didn't so I didn't touch
the distributor for fear of making things worse.

Does anyone make an aftermarket piece to replace the stock one that
has marks pressed into it?  Does anyone know where 0 degrees is in
reference to either end of the strip?  If I get lucky enough to find
one in a junkyard around here are the marks the same for 72-79?

Thanks, Jim
