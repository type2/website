Subject: 87 radio--thanks!

Thanks to everyone that responded to my 87 vanagon radio question.  The
solution:  hold the preset buttons down long enough and you can reset
the stations.  Simple, huh!  I know I tried that in the past, but it was
recently disconnected from the battery, maybe it remembered how to do it
too.

Thanks again for everyone that answered!
