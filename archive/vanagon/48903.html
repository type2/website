Subject: skylight for '85 Westy

Hi! I just purchased an 85 Westy and have a couple of little 
problems, the skylight leaks a little around the edges, the rollers 
are gone and the whole thing looks like it could stand to be 
replaced. Any thoughts on where to find one and how much they cost? 
Also, the flip covers on the drivers side that cover the electrical 
and water hookups need to be replaced. Otherwise I'm really happy 
with it and to have found this list!
Thanks,
Rick
