Subject: Bumper extentions

Hey Guys,

I'm thinking about adding some sort of extension to my front bumper. 
I've seen them on some web pics of vanagons and am looking for a
source.  Specifically, I'd like the one that protects the headlights and
radiator from brush etc.  I did see one that had a winch on it that
looked real cool, but I don't need a winch and I can't remember where I
saw it.

TIA
