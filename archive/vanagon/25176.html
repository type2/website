On Wed, 20 Sep, snuggles_at_VNET.IBM.COM asks:
&gt;IF i can't find a new filter, i can just clean this one of right? i've heard
&gt;of letting it  soak in mineral spirits or gasoline. opinions? advice?

  When I had dual Weber carbs on my bus, I had reusable air filters by K&amp;N.
They could be cleaned out using a solution of K&amp;N Filter Cleaner (which BTW
looks, smells and works just like 409) and warm water.  Always wash from the
inside of the filter to the outside.  Don't just dunk the whole thing in
a bucket or the dust you want to remove from the outside gets on the inside.
The filters were rinsed in warm water (from the inside to the outside) and 
allowed to air dry completely. The next step is to apply a light oil 
(K&amp;N Air Filter Oil) to the filter media.  The oil helps trap dust and 
dirt on the outside of the filter.

  Harley Davidson and many other motorcycle manufacturers use this type of
air filter assembly.  Check with your local hog dealer/shop and see if they
can help you with your air filter needs.


&gt;one more question: there's a thick hose leading from the carb down to a box
&gt;that is rectangular with a bar across it. looks like you pull the bar down and
&gt;then take off the lid. what is this? is this the vacuum hose? should i check
&gt;whatever is inside this box? hehehe

  This is the oil breather hose.  It ventilates the crankcase to the intake
manifold.  This keeps the pressure in the engine's crankcase from building up
and blowing out a rear main seal.
