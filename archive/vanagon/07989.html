&gt; Please,please, please, edit replys.  At 2400 baud, its very,um,
&gt; trying to have to re read everything several times to see  a few
&gt; new lines of text.
If I may, could I recommend getting the following programs:
zmodem (on the unix side) txzm on the pc side
uqwk   (&quot;&quot;)		  yarn &quot;&quot;
You'll be able to transfer stuff more quickly and read off line. It's
a very nice system.
