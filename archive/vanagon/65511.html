Subject:      Stainless Exhaust Update

Talked to Dan at STEBRO yesterday.  Exhausts for syncros will be made as
well as for the standard Vanagons.  CAT's will be offerd but not included
in the complete kit.  Price will be somewhere around $700 Can. or $500 US,
these are ballpark figures he told me as they have not decided.  All
pieces will be exactly the same dimensions as originals and the pieces
will be sold separately so that you will not need to upgrade to the
complete system if you can not afford or need to.  Dan is
going to let me know when they are ready and will &quot;allow&quot; mw to test fit
the first one to my '87 Westy &quot;lucky me&quot; cause I live near by.  STEBRO has a
web site so you can all check it out and there is an e-mail address for
your questions to them.

I think we should all send messages of thanks as this will greatly improve
the life of our Vanagons !

Cheers

Frank
