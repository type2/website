Subject: My '69 Loaf and life and questions about both (LONG)

Hi all,
   I recently changed the spark plugs on my 69 from whatever they were 
(bosch of some sort) to a set of Autolite platinums.  The net result 
seems to be all positive.  The idle smoothed out sooner after start up 
and the power is about 20% improved.  My low speed power is even improved 
and it has stopped bucking and clucking so much going around corners.  I 
looked carefully at the old plugs (seemed real old) and they were worn 
and a nice toast brown kinda light and cheery looking but not what I 
would call bad (kept em as spares).  The engine is running cooler, I 
think, seems that way anyhow.  I have also notived a throaty roar at 
about 3000 RPM in any gear, sounds like a harmonic of the engine 
vibration.  I hope this is nothing to be worried about cause I like the 
performance I'm getting now.  I found my fuel pump problems to be a loose 
connection to power causing the fuel pump to just shut off.  I had an oil 
leak at one time that was pretty bad and had the symptoms of a front seal 
going out but that has stopped and the oil level has not changed in the 
last month.  The clutch chattered for a while but has smoothed out and is 
fine now.  I suspect that I had oil on the clutch and it caused the 
problem.  The thing I wondering is now is should I take the engine out 
and replace that seal and the clutch because it's going to get bad again 
and quit on me. Or should I wait until it quits.  I've never dropped the 
engine so I don't know what I'm getting into.  My engine also seems far 
from stock as it is a 1600 (I think single port but I'm not sure) with an 
alternator and the PO said it had a higher lift cam of some sort.  It 
also has a spin on oil filter (no Rusty I haven't looked yet to see how 
it's on there.)  The only books I have right now are the 25th Muir and 
the &quot;How to rebuild your air cooled VW engine&quot; 
Any advice appreciated and ADVThanksANCE
Scott
