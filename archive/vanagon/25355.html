Hi

	I'm getting ready to leave for Pacifica for some surfin' - trying
to see if I can catch some of this swell while it lasts...

	I'll be a Predro Point aka Linda Mar, and I'm spending the night,
so if any of you Bay Area types wanna join me for a sundown session or
dawn patrol tomorrow morning, come on by!

	The reports said 8' heavy and glassy - just the way I like it.
Takin' the 9'4&quot; Pearson.

Thom
