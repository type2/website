Hello everyone

I am sorry to take so long to post this info but I had to leave for a
training school and they didn't give me much advance notice to get ready
for it. But like I promised some of you who sent me E-mail asking to pass
on the info that I received, here it is.


One of the techs that I work with is trying to find a source for VW Beatle
transmission parts. He is having a hard time finding new parts. Any help
would be greatly appreciated

Try JC Whitney 312 431 6102

Don't know if you've found the parts you need yet, but if not, call Bob
Mohler in Villa Park Calif (don't know phone # but 714 area code)
Good luck


I have 2 rebuilt transmissions for VW about 1970. I am tripping over
them and wish somebody needed them.

we are the largest supplier  of foreign auto parts in ohio. We stock a
large supply of older import parts (MG VW  etc...). Give us a call, we ship
ups everyday.
1 800 362 8104    Lake County Foreign Auto Parts Whse.
Hope this helps

        pick up a copy of &quot; hot wv's &quot; magazine there are more advertisers
of parts in there than anyone could want.

Tom,  Try Carter's Gear Box Shop in Big Bear Lake, CA  800-877-5995. I've
had
pretty good luck with them in the past.

Give this fellow a try, been using him for the VW transmission parts to
overhaul a number of transaxles for the past 3 years.  Long Enterprises -
(707)829-1169
2475 Morse Rd. - Sebasttopol, Ca. 95472

   Strongly recommend used unit. Setup of these items and special tools
involved are harder to locate than the parts, especially on Buses.

  However, Recycled Parts  (formerly Recycled Bugs) in Michigan or
J.C.Whitney should have your stuff.

Here's a name of a place where I live that might be some help. Vee
Village parts in Kansas City, Mo. (816)421-6441

Hi Tom, call Harold at Carters Gearbox Shop, in Big Bear, CA.
(909)866-2221 He`s the
guy.

Try German transaxle. their # is 541-382-7723. They are located in Bend,
Oregon.

My Father in law ownes a VW shop called The Beetle Barn.  He also has
several acres of old parts and cars,   If you are interested His name is
Warren Srephens and the shop phone # is (702) 459-8691  .
     I'm sure he can ship it to you. We are in Las Vegas, NV.

Well, that is about it. Again, sorry for the delay.
