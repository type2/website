&gt; The only thing you can get brand new in an MV is the Winnebago version of
&gt; the camper. That comes complete with the stove, refrigerator, etc. as the
&gt; old Westys had. There is no &quot;weekender&quot; version being made by Winnebago.

Don't forget the real-live Westfalia camper, too.  I saw one of these on
Hwy 101 south of Eureka CA about 4 months ago.  Standard wheelbase van, not
the big one that Winnie uses.  Maybe our friends from Canada know about
their availability, or maybe the people I saw imported their own from
Europe?
