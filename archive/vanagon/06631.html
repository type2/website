&gt; Hey James,
&gt; 
&gt; Martha and I have been discussing here plans to use the stove as
&gt; a heater off-line.  She's concerned about the by products of the
&gt; LP burn and how to evacuate/vent them out of the camper.  I thought
&gt; that there were no nasty by-products from burning LP gas and that
&gt; the only concern would be the replacement of oxygen.  Can you
&gt; or anyone else clarify this?
&gt; 

I have no personal expert knowledge on the matter. Every printed manual 
on propane heaters I've seen, and campers, and personal advice has been 
to vent with an open window. I usually do this, but many times have not 
if the weather is terribly foul. I don't feel well if I do not vent for 
the night, and although this is mild, I attribute it to a lack of fresh 
air.  The fellow I saw with clay pots on his burners seemed fine...had 
done this for a long time. 

James
