It is a secret among Volkswagen Vanagon Syncro owners (1986-1991) that this
vehicle is 
an awsome off-road performer and can hold its own against Range Rovers,
Toyota Land 
Cruisers, and American pick ups no matter how bad the terrain becomes. This
is due to 
a little known fact: the Vanagon Syncro is not manufactured by Volkswagen but
rather 
by the famous Austrian manufactuer of African off-road vehicles
Steyr-Daimler-Puch. 

Yes, the &quot;Daimler&quot; in that name is Mercedes, and in fact, the Vanagon Syncro
is 
assembled in the same factory that made the Mercedes G-Wagon.

In order to improve the ground clearance of my 1990 Vanagon Syncro Camper I
lifted 
the rear by adding on each side rubber spacers that go in between the rear
coil springs 
and the vehicle body. Meanwhile, I am planning a strategy to lift the front
of the vehicle 
and have a question about the two front shock absorbers. 

Only one shock absorber for the front of the Vanagon Syncro is sold in North
America 
and has part number 251-413-031-C. In Germany, however, there are also shock 
absorbers with the same number except that they end with the letters &quot;M&quot; and
&quot;N&quot;.  In 
the notes in the microfiche it says that &quot;C&quot; is for vehicles with 14&quot; wheels
(as are all 
North American Vanagons), that &quot;M&quot; is for vehicles with option 469/&quot;Vehicles
With 
Rough Road Equipment,&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is for vehicles with 16&quot; wheels. 

The Vanagons sold with 16&quot; wheels were not offered in North America, but they
came 
with beefed up and raised suspensions for ultra heavy duty off road use
elsewhere in the 
world. The lower control arms in the 16&quot; Vanagon, for example, are more heavy
duty 
than the same parts in our 14&quot; Vanagons.

My question is this: I need help selecting one of these shock absorbers for
my van. I 
intend to order a set from a dealer in Germany and have it sent to my New
York City 
apartment but cannot find someone who knows anything about these shocks. 
Is the &quot;M&quot; merely a more heavy duty shock.  And is &quot;N&quot; the same thing but but
with 
provision for a raised vehicle? If so, then I have in mind to buy the &quot;N&quot;
shocks. Will this 
get me into trouble and will it accomplish my aim?

It may sound odd to think that a shock is going to raise the vehicle but
consider how 
these shocks are designed: there is a flange half way up the shock that
supports a coil 
spring. The coil spring then goes up to connect with the vehicle body. The
ride height of 
the vehicle depends on the how far up the shock the flange is welded on.
Since the 16&quot; 
Vanagon rides much higher off the ground than a 14&quot; Vanagon, is seems
possible the 
additional ground clearance is obtained in this way. The additional ground
clearance of a 
16&quot; Vanagon is not from the springs because the springs between the two
different 
vehicles are identical and carry the same part number.

My worry is that if I order the 16&quot; shock it will not fit inside my lower
control arms or 
that it will not raise the vehicle as I wish it to. I have been poking at
people trying to get 
the answer to this question for three years now and thought you might be able
to help as 
a last resort. I have already written to Boge in Europe, to Volkswagen in
Germany, and to Steyr-Daimler-Punch in Austria--all without success. I have
also made enquires to Ron's Parts, to Oettinger, and to Projecktwo. I assume
that the folks at Projectzwo know the answer but they were too busy to answer
a letter from an American in English who they did not know personally.)

					Please Help,

P.S. Let me know, Greg, if you want me to have you added to the Vanagon
electronic mailing list. You will get about 30 messages a day in your mail
box about all years of VW vans. About 3/4ths of these messages are just noise
from people abusing the list to chatter mindlessly but about about 5% of the
messages are serious and are gold. 

Here is a typical exchange recently which will help you appreciate my syncro
question better:
