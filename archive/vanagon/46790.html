Subject: Warming Engine OIL


Just came off the parkway with the 87 gulf and the oil light and 
buzzer sounded. I had the same problem with the vanagon it was the 
oil pressure switch. I just had the oil changed and he talked me 
into 10/30 for the summer, could this cause the problem. The oil 
was to level.

          When I bought My 1986 Vanagon in 1990, I made the 
          mistake of putting 10w-30 weight oil into it. Shortly 
          after that the oil light would come on at idle, after
          running it hard under a load.
             
          WARNING!!! DO NOT USE 10w-30 WEIGHT OIL IN YOUR VANAGON!

          I use 10w-40 all year round hear in W. PA, BUT It is
          important to use heavier oil in hotter Weather, (summer) 
          lighter oil in extreme colder weather (winter).

          Now 6 years later it still runs like a top
