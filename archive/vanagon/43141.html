Subject: Sliding door grease...

What is the recommended type of grease for the lower guide wheels on a
Vanagon?  What little non-gravel-filled-blackened-stuff was left on mine
('89 and '90). Looked yellow or yellow/orange and was quite a bit thicker
than ordinary &quot;bearing grease&quot;.  Almost like thickened Vaseline.
