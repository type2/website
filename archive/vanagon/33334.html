Subject: Re: VAN Tires and Tim's EV Nightmare

&gt; I'm still looking for decent replacement tires for my EV. After owning
&gt; Goodyears (Invicta) and hearing NET discussions about how wretched
&gt; Michelins have become, I am finding I don't have alot of choices for
&gt; 205-65-15's with a &quot;Reinforced Sidewall.&quot;

Original tires on my EV are Goodyars but not an American tire.  Doesn't 
have a name but a number.  We got a replacement for the tired destroyed 
by accident debris I hit on the interstate at a place called &quot;just Tires&quot; 
that is apparently owned by Goodyear.  Tires are G64 model size 
195/65R15C if I remember correctly all the way in the house up stairs 
from the driveway. M+S rated as well.  I like these tires.

&gt; Now I've heard nothing but
&gt; good stuff about Nokian Tires from Finland and even found a dealer in
&gt; Wisconsin who will mail them to me (the NRW M+S tire). The only prob-
&gt; lem is that these tires do not say &quot;Reinforced&quot; on them. Yet the Nokian
&gt; dealer looked up the 93 EV is his handbook and it listed these particular
&gt; tires as the right ones. I called two local VW dealers and they both
&gt; incanted &quot;Reinforced&quot; several times, &quot;because the tires you have on the
&gt; van say that.&quot; The Conti CS 21's I have have 5 plies on the tread and
&gt; 2 on the sidewall; the Nokians are 4 x 2. So....who do I believe??
&gt; Is anything done differently to the sidewall in a reinforced tire??

Don't know anything about these tires.

&gt;      In short this van is fantastic. It's the best kept (or should I say most
&gt; overlooked) secret on the road. Great heat, handling, comfort, space, accelera-
&gt; tion. It's the only European van on the market here and it's quality is second
&gt; to none. We test drove most of the others. THose who lamented earlier this
&gt; fall about the plastic on the newer VW's should check out their chintzy compe-
&gt; tition. Type I-III owners take note: if you can find and afford an EV, snap
&gt; it up.

I agree on all of this.  With the European Goodyears I had almost no 
trouble driving this van through unplowed streets with over 20 incheds of 
snow!
