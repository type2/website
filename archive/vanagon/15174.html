Subject: Changing EuroVan Plugs


SUCCESS!!! Yep did it!!! (not that I doubted that I couldn't)...but
this event marks one of those special events of new car ownership...
the start of doing your own maintanance!

For those of you EVers who haven't attempted this little task, its
quite easy! First off go to your local VW dealer and get a set
of plugs (about $4.00 a pop), I would suggest the stock one as
they are dual electrode types. Unfortuanately, IMHO, they are
made by &lt;gag&gt; Champion...

Now to the fun part. You will need a 10mm socket, as well as
a plug socket, universal joint, two long, and one short
extension as well as a ratshit...ratshit, isn't that bigger than
a mouseshit?

To get at the plugs, you need to remove the 4 10mm head bolts
that are on the ends of the radiator crossmember. Next give
the cross-member a good upwards tug. That will engage the hinge
and sliding mechanism. The radiator/fan/grill assy will move
up and forward. Once the radiator assy is out of the way, there
is plenty of room to get at the plugs.

Assemble your socket...joint (universal that is...c'ept for
you california types)...and extensions...remove your
plugs...the left most one (as you are facing the engine) is
a bit of a bear to get at.

Once the plugs are out...check out the old ones....and then
put in the new ones. BTW the plug wires are nicely staggered
so that it would take a real twit to cross the wires.

Replace the plug wires, lift up the radiator assy and drop
it back in place. Replace the 10mm bolts...and voila!

Total Time &lt; 20 minutes.


Here's one thing you may want to note when you are changing your
plugs...how clean your engine is. Eventhough the bottom pan
is a pain in the ass when it comes to chaning the oil &amp; filter
it seems to do an excellent job of keeping water/dust/etc
out of the engine compartment.

One last thing...VW recommends changing your EV plugs at approx.
30k miles...from what I saw on my plugs, I'd change that to
20k miles!
