Subject: VeHickle Covers

As my 87 Westy Syncro has no garage to call home (at least 'till I tunnel
from the street through the rockery and beneath the front yard), the
approach of the rainy season has me considering the purchase of a cover .

What are people's experiences with covers, and does anyone have brand
reccomendations?

I have two major concerns (perhaps there are others):

1. Given the damp climate here in the Pacific NW, a waterproof but
non-breathable cover (as most seem to be) might result in massive
condensation under said cover, leaving the vehicle wetter and more rust
prone that if it was left uncovered.

2. Winter here tends to be fairly windy. Might a  wind-whipped cover abrade
against the body of the vehicle enough to wear off paint?

As always, thanks!

Paul
