Subject: vanagon info

I have a few questions about vanagons.
	1. What was the first year for the square headlights?
	2. Are the vanagon automatic tranmissions prone to failure?
	3. I've heard stories of coolant leakage at the cyl. heads, is this a common 
problem with the waterboxer engine?
	4. Are there any other notable quirks about vanagons that would be handy to 
know while looking for one to purchase?

I am a mechanic so I know about the obvious things to look for when doing a 
pre-purchase inspection on a vehicle. Any information would be appreciated.

		Thanks
