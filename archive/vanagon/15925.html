&gt; We would be willing to swap our Vanagon Westy for one week during the summer
&gt; for anyone with  a Westy in California (San Diego or SF). Since
&gt; renting is expensive this may be a preferred alternative for people.
&gt;

&gt; Has anyone tried this before? Any problems (legal or otherwise) that we
&gt; should be aware of?

Theonly legal thing I'd beconcerned about is they way your insurance 
works.  Some companies hold the owner of the vehicle responsible for any 
accidents even if they aren't the ones that were driving.
