Well I went to get gramma  for a early easter dinner . I have to work
tommorrow 
an the way back the syncro broke down  .  The van was running great the
levels were perfect  and although I still saw some drips under the sync i
keep going     only drove about 10 miles . What happened is I heard a bang
and the clutch broke  
SYMPTOMS
1} clutch popped to top with my foot on it 
2}  a big bang   and something banged under the van
3}engine keeped running but the van froze     would'nt move 
4}  clutch petal would not depress
5} checked engine and under van    everythin looked fine 
6}  had to fight ti get AAA to flat bed to Hendricks   he said hook was fine
as long as all 4 wheels touched the ground
7}  new clutch    7 months  5,000 miles  dealer installed   if it is the
clutch cylinder
