So David Easterwood says:
&gt; 
&gt; Okay east coasters, I don't want to hear you bitching and moaning
&gt; about nothing happening over here.  We're out here doing things
&gt; and would LOVE for you to join in the fun.
&gt; 
&gt; wade out into the river holding onto a rope, lay down and let go.  What
&gt; a rush as the swift current drug you over and down the falls.  The very
&gt; last rock you hit before hitting the pool below gives it the appropriate
&gt; nickname.

Sound like you folks in the So. East know how to have a good time.  
It also looks like you know how to hang on to your VW's too. ;)

Glad you had a good time.

Cheers!
