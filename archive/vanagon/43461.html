Subject: FS in West. WA 2 splits

I am selling a late 67 westy camper.   It has reverse lights and a pop top
that pops straight up.    The brakes,  front suspension  and  the transaxle
are rebuilt.    It came from so cal and is very rust free.   it is a solid,
good running bus.



the other splitty for sale belongs to a friend.   It is a 58 delivery van
with doors on both sides.      It has a 61 trans and a 1600sp motor.     It
runs good, rebuildt brakes last year, resealed windows, could use a paint job
as the original dove blue is faded.   it was in eastern wa, and has minimal
rust.   He's asking $2500 obo.

both are in olympia, wa.   email me or call 360 866 7240
