&gt;&gt;OR - a la Bob Hoover, crush the beans with a hammer, rock,  and stir the
&gt;&gt;coffee with a wrench!
&gt;
&gt;

It was not a 'wrench' it was a three-eights-drive flex-handle, recently wiped
down with WD-40 and an old sock.

For all the yuppie-spawn out there, Camp Coffee is NOT boiled.  You heat the
water to boiling, remove it from from the heat and throw in the appropriate
amount of ground, crushed or stomped-on beans.  Stir the brew occasionally
then after a few minutes, return it to the fire.  When you see the first
signs of a rolling boil, remove from the heat, add a cup of cold water, allow
the grounds to settle, then serve.  Once the coffee is added the brew is
NEVER allowed to boil.  

And it wasn't 'an old coffee can'.  I made the coffee in a relatively new
tomato paste can.  My camping equipment consists of tin cans, all clean and
new for each trip.  If they get sooty from the campfire, pack them in a paper
bag, otherwise use a selection of cans that will nest within one another, and
the entire collection within a bucket, the other necessary container for
comfortable camping.
