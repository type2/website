Subject: Re: Wild Problem on '57!

&gt;Well fellow VWers!
&gt;
&gt;I have the craziest problem on my '57!  I am experiencing what I have 
&gt;termed &quot;Unintended Four Wheel Steering.&quot; (with apologies to our 
&gt;friends at Audi.)

I had an Austin Mini with similiar problems. The rear trailing axle mounts 
were rusted out. Depending on how I was pushing the car around the rear axle 
would re-align itself at inopportune times. Very scary when the back end 
hydroplaned once. Check the mounts or bushings for tightness. You need to do 
this with the wheel of the ground but the suspension still loaded, otherwise 
it will fix itself by moving into an unused tighter position. I'm assuming 
the wheel bearings are OK. tim s.
