Subject: New Tire experience, Y370's

A final thanks to all the help finding the Yokohama Y370's at a decent price.

I finally found them at about US$80.00 a piece.  I had to go 250 miles, but
it was worth it.  They were really put to the test, too.  Here in Vermont we
had snow last week, rain Sunday, and I drove 250 miles highway, too.
 Excelent performance, traction, and stability.  A very very slight hum at
highway speeds, though.  The car even steers much easier that with the old
tires.
