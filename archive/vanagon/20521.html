_______________________________________________________________________________
The moral of the story, however is not just for Thing owners, but for all of 
us - I highly recommend carrying one of these emergency belts and a fire 
extinguisher at all times.  That is, unless you think you can't control your 
multiple-personality-disorders  :)

  which kind of emergency belt do you favor?
