&gt; Hi all (especially Syncro owners. Derek Drew, Tim Smith - are you out there?)
&gt; 
&gt; I know the owners manual says that the only way to tow a Vanagon Syncro is on
&gt; a flat-bed truck or trailer so that none of the wheels is on the ground.
&gt;  It's especially important that neither pair of wheels is on the ground while
&gt; the other pair is not. 
&gt; How about towing a Syncro with ALL the wheels on the ground?  It seems to me
&gt; that this would be o different to the drivetrain than coasting with the
&gt; clutch in or the transmission in neutral.  Can anyone think of a reason that
&gt; this would be a problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help.

&gt;From what I remember from the manual of my old Mazda 323 GTX:(It was all
wheel drive)  The problem with towing the AWD vechicles is that all is OK
until you take a turn, then the front wheels are turning at a different
speed from the rear wheels and everything gets torn up.
The Mazda people VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED against this practice as it would
trash an expensive drivetrain.
