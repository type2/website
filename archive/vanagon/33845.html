Subject: Vanagon diesels

I'm curious about the diesels. I don't notice much about them in the list
except in the context of a conversion. I currently own a Mercedes 300 turbo
with which I'm thrilled, having graduated from a 240, and wonder if the vw
diesel is anything like as strong and reliable.

The 240 was 15 yrs old and had  165k on it when totalled and the 300 is an 82
with 148k. Care and feeding consists mainly of a steady flow of oil every 3k
and a trip to a &quot;pro&quot; every 25k or so for his blessing. So I understand blue
clouds of smoke in the morning, diesel clatter and the inability to get out
of my own way until thoroughly warm(but oh the heat!). 

Is the vanagon a real diesel or a cobbled up gas motor like GM tried? Does it
have the same cooling/leaking probs. that  the water cools report? Is it
really any slower than the air cooled? Does it &quot;feel&quot;good to drive one, or is
it really too much of an odd ball to be part of the tribe?

I'm thinking in terms of a camper which of course means more weight and
probably long periods of inactivity.When buying my 81, I fairly religiously
tracked down any campers that were offered for a 6 month period and don't
recall seeing a single diesel.

Any opinions objective or purely subjective would be of great interest.

Thanks,

Weston
