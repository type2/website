Subject: AVP for engines

As I continue to look for the best deal on the best engine to put into my
'81, I have come across a company called AVP worldwide.  They seem like
nice folks, and Leonard spent a long time explaining why a rebuilt head
with seats put in so they don't fall out would be a better bet than new AMC
heads from Spain, which drop seats fairly commonly.

If anyone has experience with these folks, please give me an opinion on the
company or their engines.

I'm not unreasonable... I just want a bulletproof engine that puts out
maybe 400HP, gets 50 MPG, and installs itself.  It would be nice if it was
a LOT smaller than a stock engine, so I could install a trunk. :-)

Thanks,

Bill
