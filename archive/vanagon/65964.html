Volks.

I have an 86 Westy in which I noticed an abnormal amount of wear on the rotor
and distributor cap contacts. I have to change both about every 3500 miles.
Does this mean I need a whole new distributor like my local VW parts
store/shop tells me. Or, is there a simple less expensive method. I was
quoted $ 270 for a new distributor.
Thanks in advance.
