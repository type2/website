 Any battery experts out there who can tell me whether the deep cycle 
 battery is ok?  Is its main advantage that it can power the appliances  
 longer (in ADDITION to its ability to handle being discharged 
 repeatedly)?  &gt;&gt;


If the people at Pet boys were real experts, they probably wouldn,t be
working ar Pep Boys.  The VW charging system is no different than that in a
Winebago.  The Deep Cycle battery will work fine except it will not fit
properly under the seat.  With some customizing, it can be done although a
vented battery box under the rear seat would be better.
