Subject: I'm selling my 1973 Westphalia



Hi all,

Just in case anyone here is interested, I'm selling one of my
busses.


For Sale:

1973 Volkswagen Westphalia, orange with white top
  ~157,000 miles - top end rebuilt at 100,000
  Location: Tucson, Arizona
  $1800

The Good:
  Paint, body, and poptop in reasonable shape, no rust.
  Engine and transmission good, compression still OK. (worst = 16% leakdown)
  AM/FM cassette with 4 speakers.
  All original camping equipment present except front child's cot.
    -folding rear bed
    -rear closet
    -rear overhead storage
    -jump seat
    -ice box/sink/cupboard
    -folding table
    -pop-top canvas is old and has bad zippers, but still usable
    -good curtains on all back windows and front snap-on curtain

Recently Fixed:
  New ignition lock, key, and switch.  (had to wiggle old key)
  Replaced brake vacuum assist booster to improve brakes.
  Rebuilt carburetors, had throttle bodies rebushed.

The Bad:
  Needs front end work, at least tie rod ends, probably ball joints too.
  Front seats are not stock, a previous owner put in high-back buckets
  No side tent or rear hatch screen (I don't know if it ever had these.)

Reason for Selling:
  I have fallen in love with the early split-window busses and bought
  a '66.  I like the look, the ease of maintenance, and safari windows!
  I need money for body work, paint, building an engine, headliner, etc.

I think, with a little work, this can be an excellent camper.  I have
certainly had a lot of fun camping in it.


Cheers,

 -Dyer
