Subject: 1997 Transporter T4 spotted.

Schponfirkle.

I saw the second one of these things on the street today and it made my head
spin.  I really *did* see it right the first time!

What am I talking about?  The '97 Transporter has had a facelift.  While the
panel van version has ventilation slots above the front wheels (a la
Mercedes), more rounded front and rear bumpers (fenders to those in the New
World) and a restyled, more rounded fascia and dashboard, I saw two
Caravelles with a completely new front-end design.  I didn't post about it
before as I thought I had mistaken a Mercedes van for a Volkswagen, but I
saw a second one this afternoon.  The driver was amused at my slack-jaw stare!

To my eyes, the new T4 front is a rip-off of Mercedes' frontal design.
Slanted headlamps and a more sculpted bonnet (translation: hood) seem to be
the major differences.  I shall confirm next week that the panel van will
remain in the original configuration and I'll let you know.

I don't think I like the look of the new design ... which probably means
that I'll grow to love it.

Howls,
