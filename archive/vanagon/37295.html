Subject: '90 Westy interior cleaning..

Hi Everyone.  Thanks to all who replied to my query last week about 
washing the top bunk cushion covers.  Well, we washed them over the 
weekend, and they turned out *great*.  We used Woolite as a 
detergent, and even put in some fabric softener.  

We washed all the curtains year before last, and also noticed a big 
difference.  If you haven't washed these items yet, you should.  The 
results are worth the effort.

We spray our top bunk cushions with Scotchguard every year.  This 
stops moisture from when you sleep on the cushion from going 
past the fabric and into the foam, acting as a barrier.  We usually 
air our cushions out after every camp, and have yet to find the foam 
damp or wet.  We also spray the felt/fuzzy stuff on the poptop every 
year after a good cleaning.  

I cleaned up all the cabinets, in &amp; out with Armor-All Cleaner.  If 
you haven't used this stuff before it's pretty good.  It's non-toxic, 
non-corrosive, and works very well.  It does a great job on the 
melamine surfaces, and the wallpaper in the Westy.  The trick is to 
wipe the cabinets down with a damp/wet cloth and then follow with a 
dry cloth.  Looks like new.

This weekend is time to spend time on the body.  I got a Zymol wax 
starter kit for Christmas and it's time to put it use.  I had the 
paint &quot;sealed&quot;  when new with one of these &quot;never wax again&quot; things.  
This one is a product from Granatize.  Well, I can do better.  Our 
van is white and paint gets &quot;dirty&quot; after a while and needs regular 
cleaning.  So, might as well use the real stuff!!  I will use the 
HD-Cleanse to clean the paint, and then use the Zymol Fantasy Acrylic 
wax which contains 35% carnuba.  I can hardly wait!!... and today is 
only Monday... arrrgghhh! :(

Can hardly wait for the weekend...
Harry.
