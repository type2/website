&gt;I am rebuilding a 1700cc pancake engine.  I looked in the Haynes 
&gt;manual on how to put the valves back in and I noticed that it says to 
&gt;put on new oil sealing rings aroung the valves.  The picture shows 
&gt;something that lookes like a washer that fits onto the valve shaft on 
&gt;the rocker side after the valve has been put througn the cylinder 
&gt;head.  The problem is that when I took the engine apart there were 
&gt;not any of theses rings on my valves.  Did only certain engines have 
&gt;these?  Do I need to buy some? Is oil leaking down the valve guide a 
&gt;problem with horizontal valves?  Thanks for any help.

The rings should be included in the engine gasket kit.  Most do not use them
as they do not do much f the giudes are not worn.  If used, they will quicky
crack and fall off and you will find them on the oil screen.
