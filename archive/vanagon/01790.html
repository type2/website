Subject:       Best place to buy a bus

My '77 bus is starting to have some serious corrosion problems.  
She's been here in Illinois for most of her life, and the salt and 
rain are taking their toll.  So, I've been contemplating taking a 
plane somewhere out west and finding a bus with considerably less of 
the red stuff.  Does anyone out there know what the market is like 
for busses in places like San Diego, Phoenix, L.A., Alburquerque, and 
elsewhere out there?  Does anyone have any suggestions on the best 
place to go?  Also, are the classifieds the best place to seek out 
these vehicles, or do you know of other places to look when shopping? 

By the way, as far as colors go, my bus (Matilda) is beige and white 
with various graffiti covering the whole of it.  She also has some 
Texas longhorns mounted on the front below the windshield.  She draws 
alot of attention.
