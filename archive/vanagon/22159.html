Subject: Nose skin transplant

Attention ALL `Dub surgeons.....


I am in the process of repairing/restoring a 66 Bus and am at the point
where I'd like to replace the nose skin entirely with the skin from a
donor bus.  Before anyone suggests metalwork, let me preface by saying
that there is zero possibility of a satisfactory repair of the existing
skin. The nose took a pretty hard strike with a tire mmounted on the
front. Enough of an impact to crush the heater tube, twang the roof cap,
and crinkle the passenger side floorboard.

I took the bus to my local alignment guy who checked frame alignment and
looked for signs of other booboo's but nothing was found so I assume I'm
&quot;good to go...&quot; Doors line up well, windshield frames and all other stuff
seem unaffected. I replaced the floorboards on both sides (tacked in) and
they line up fine (don't understand why the pass side crinked?) so now I'd
like to remove the old skin and replace it.

I've done a few door skin replacements, and a fair amount of welding both
oxy/acet and MIG and am open to any and all suggestions from novices and
experts alike. I'd like to amass a wealth of &quot;options&quot; before taking the
dive and snipping the front of my bus...

thanks to all in advance
