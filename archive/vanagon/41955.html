To All:

The use of non-corroding fasteners on your exhaust system is right up there
with putting air in pneumatic tires.  Naval bronze is another good choice and
the nuts can be locally fabricated from bar stock, but it also pays to check
with your local Toyota dealer.  They used hard brass exhaust nuts of the same
size as the VW studs (8mm x 1.25) on some of their vehicles and the dealer
may have some in stock.  Stainless steel is better but harder to find.
