Subject: Re: Sodium Valves: Your Ticket to Fame and Fortune! or something.

&gt;On the bug, before the oil cooler was shifted, the # 3 exhaust valve would
&gt;normally run the hottest of the four and so it was agood idea to set it
&gt;in extra thousand open. I have a #3 exhaust valve ('69 KG Cabrio in
&gt;storage) sitting on my desk
&gt;here; it is warped and has a chip out of it. Before it and the others were
&gt;replaced , I could hear a tick tick tick sound which I guess was gas
&gt;escaping past the valve.

I too have a #3 exhaust valve, or at least what was left of it, sitting on 
my desk :-) I kept it as a reminder of my faithful first bus which suffered 
some extreme abuse but was unstoppable. I only took the engine out to 
replace the crank oil seal after a trip to France (oil started pouring out 
on the way back and I had to keep stopping to fill it up) but thought I 
might as well overhaul the heads while it was out. #3 valve looked like a 
daisy and #4 had a fair chunk missing as well. The engine still ran, 
although it was noisy as hell and idled a bit rough but I just thought all 
VWs were like that. It was probably on the verge of self-destruction but I 
hadn't noticed any sudden drop in power so it could have been running on two 
cylinders for quite a while. I replaced all four exhaust valves but nothing 
else and the bus is still going strong two years later.
