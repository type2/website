Subject: Re: aux heaters




&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what a 13-year-old working gas heater is worth.  Maybe someone
&gt; else in the group does?  Nor do I know how much gas it uses -- never used it
&gt; that consistently.  At -30oC., do you really care?
&gt; B.
&gt; Are there problems in hooking one up?
