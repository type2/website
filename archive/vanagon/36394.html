&gt; Repairing fuel system related problems on modern spark ignition
&gt; automotive engines can be a nightmare. The manual is often not detailed
&gt; enough on all the sensors and electronics. A good source of information
&gt; is the emmission tuneup specifications. See for instance &quot;Mitchells&quot;
&gt; tuneup guide. You should be able to find this one in a good library
&gt; and copy the sections related to your EV (and your daughters Volvo).
