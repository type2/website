Subject:      EGR on '81 Vanagon Westie

Amy 81 Westie came without a catalytic converter, and the requisite exhaust
components to tie the egr tube from the intake manifold to the exhaust pipe.
So the way it is set up, the egr intake hangs down around the muffler,
feeding unfiltered air to the intake manifold at all times.  Attempts to
&quot;adjust&quot; the egr throttle attachment haven't made any difference re: the
always available suction I feel from the end of the open pipe, at idle, and
increasing with throttle opening.

Otherwise, the engine seems to be running well, plugs look very good when I
pull them after 10K or so for inspection, etc.

Questions:
1) should I just leave the set up as it is for now, with the egr intake
open?(it has been running this way for at least 30K, with no apparent ill
effects.
2) should I just block it off?
3) if (2) what effects will it have (if any?)

If I can do ANYTHING to get better mileage, I'd love to...but I don't know
if messing with the EGR will make any difference here. BTW, when this
muffler dies, I will probably re-install a cat (not that emissions are
checked in my part of Ohio, but they may be at some point.)
BTW, this vehicle has a FI emissions set up without an oxygen sensor.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.
