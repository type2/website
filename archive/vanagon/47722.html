  Sorry but I disagree with the fact of OEM rotors on a bug.
  Not in the USA anyway, maybe an unintentional offering but
  almost all had drums brakes. 
  I am in PGH. PA. If your anywhere near by there  are 2 VW 
  shows coming up.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm back from a fun-filled ten day adventure through the South!  Originally
&gt; the plan was to visit a friend in North Carolina and spend a week camping in
&gt; the Carolinas.  In the end, we completed a 3,435 mile round trip from
&gt; Connecticut through the beautiful South and into New Orleans and back again
&gt; in our homey, reliable '71 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; We left Friday, July 19 after much last minute packing.  That morning we
&gt; installed a rear hatch window seal.  I had removed the old, dry seal and the
&gt; window on Wednesday to remove the rust and rustoleum the sill.  The window
&gt; eventually went back in fine, but no thanks to me.  Lajiri, my fiancee,
&gt; ended up figuring out how to install the window after I stared at it,
&gt; frustrated and puzzled.  It was our first window installation and once she
&gt; figured out it would be a good idea to wrap the string around the seal
&gt; channel a couple times it was a cinch to compress the seal and pull the lip
&gt; over the channel.  Fortunately if one of us gets stuck solving a car problem
&gt; (usually me), the other is there to troubleshoot and straighten things out
&gt; (usually her).  With the van now watertight (heh heh), we finished stuffing
&gt; it with spare parts (including two spare tires which would come in handy
&gt; later) and camping items and pulled out onto the open road.
&gt; 
&gt; The drive to our friend's place in North Carolina (mostly down I-95) took
&gt; close to 14 hours thanks to some traffic in New York.  Amidst the major
&gt; domino-effect car accident in the northbound lanes we saw a highway car fire
&gt; in NY going and coming (both nonVW).  Ahhhhh, lovely New York--bye New York!
&gt; We chose to take the Pallisades Parkway through NJ to avoid the George
&gt; Washington bridge and enjoy the tree scenery along the parkway.  Our arrival
&gt; in Bynum, NC, just outside Chapel Hill, around 5 am was unceremonious: we
&gt; shut the engine down just after dipping into the driveway, and stealthily
&gt; rolled to a stop by our friend's house.  There we slept until our friend
&gt; took Buddy the wonderdog out for a walk at 9am.  Buddy, a playful black lab
&gt; mix, (who didn't hear our bus roll in the driveway hours earlier thanks to
&gt; the din of the house air conditioning) was very much alarmed at the sight of
&gt; our red bus and his frantic barking became our wake-up call.
&gt; 
&gt; We spent the weekend in NC, touring lovely rural Bynum and walking along the
&gt; Haw River.  Bynum is an old mill town and the houses on our friend's street
&gt; have only had running water and electricity since 1978.  One of the
&gt; neighbors told us a story about an elderly woman who rented a house in Bynum
&gt; since the Dark Ages and until she moved recently was payed a whopping rent
&gt; of $36/year.  The most famous Bynumite lives across the street from our
&gt; friend.  Clyde is an artist who is famous for making the world famous
&gt; &quot;Clyde's Critters&quot;, which are basically carved out hunks of cedar log and
&gt; miscellaneous added-on plastic bits to form animal-statue-art.  His house
&gt; has paintings of critters on the outer walls and roof, and his yard is
&gt; literally filled with his creations.  Clyde is very genial and welcomes
&gt; tourists to walk through his yard and view his art anytime--a really nice
&gt; guy and a nice, funky neighborhood.
&gt; 
&gt; While we were sorry to end our stay in Bynum, we had a big plan to meet with
&gt; a magistrate on monday morning and get hitched--our real reason for this
&gt; trip--and a nice surprise twist to this story!!  We figured we'll do a big
&gt; ceremony with friends one of these days, but we both liked the idea of
&gt; taking off on a roadtrip vacation and getting married.  So with little pomp
&gt; or circumstance we bought our license, swore our oath, said our goodbyes to
&gt; our friend, and hightailed it to Lousiana.  
&gt; 
&gt; We've always wanted to visit New Orleans, and last year when we spent time
&gt; in the Tennessee area we wanted to visit Lousiana, but ran out of time.  So
&gt; now, on the fly, we made another marathon drive from Chapel Hill, NC to New
&gt; Orleans, stopping every 400 miles or so for gas and taking shifts at the
&gt; wheel.  Our trusty 1600cc engine with 60k miles on the bottom end and 45k on
&gt; the top performed admirably.  At every fillup I checked the dipstick and it
&gt; was hot as finger burning hell, but we pressed on carelessly, confident that
&gt; our little bus would give us this trip as our wedding gift...and it did!
&gt; 
&gt; We passed through Atlanta, GA at 10:30pm--so no olympic-sized traffic
&gt; hassles on I-20--and vowed to see the sights on the way back through Alabama
&gt; and perhaps stop off in Washington, D.C. at a more liesurely pace.  When we
&gt; both tired of driving in shifts we would pull off at a rest area and catch
&gt; some sleep before the next leg of our journey.  A couple VW items that
&gt; complemented the trip well were the VW-Grundig shortwave radio that Michael
&gt; Heron sold me and our newly installed VDO clock.  The shortwave kept us in
&gt; touch with the olympics and other news around the world, so the further we
&gt; drove away from home, the smaller the world felt as we tuned in to radio
&gt; Netherlands, BBC and of course radio Deutschevela (sp).  And there's nothing
&gt; like relying on an original VDO clock in a German car for the time ;-). It
&gt; was at a KOA outside New Orleans that we decided to spend the night with
&gt; showers and a swimming pool, and hit the famous French Quarter the next day.  
&gt; Unbeknownst to us, what lurked at our campsite was a confederate army of
&gt; Lousiana ants that saw their chance to attack some yankee tourists.  While
&gt; that night's sleep went well, in the morning as I began packing our
&gt; makeshift awning I noticed a steady stream of ants climbing one of the
&gt; awning poles, marching across the awning, and disappearing under the front
&gt; door gasket.  When I opened the front passenger door, to my horror, I saw
&gt; the invasion was nearly complete!  The whole underside of the front mat was
&gt; infested with at least 4 regiments of the ant army and they were using the
&gt; cover of the dark red carpet to move reserves up the lines toward the
&gt; cooler.  The carnage that followed is too horrific a story to tell--as I
&gt; mercilessly crushed every soldier in sight.  The remaining holdouts would
&gt; get their revenge on me later, though. Somehow Lajiri went unscathed through
&gt; the whole ordeal.  The ants knew their real enemy and despite further
&gt; extermination efforts I was left with battle scars from the renegade ants
&gt; who attacked me later on our journey back through Alabama.  Those Lousiana
&gt; ants are tough cookies!
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this isn't too long for y'all--I'm having fun remembering and I'm
&gt; really excited about planning your next road trip.  Stay tuned for part deux
&gt; of our trek through the south and the further adventures of our fiery red 71
&gt; westy!
