That should answer most of your questions.

&gt; Turbo-Diesel Volks,
&gt; Sorry for the bandwidth, but Diesels are Vanagons too! (Did I say that
&gt; backwards?) Looking for anyone who has added on a turbocharger from a
&gt; 1.6 TD to the non-turbo 1.6l diesel in our Diesel Vanagons? Anyone
&gt; -know- anyone who has done it? I am contemplating this and have
&gt; questions unanswered.
