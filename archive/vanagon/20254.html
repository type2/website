Subject:       Re:  propane tank label--dangerous defect

Steve asks:
&gt; What is the liability of not having that label on there?  Isn't it suppose
&gt; to be left on?  Can you clarify this?  I'd like to remove mine, but I just
&gt; want to know the legal ramifications.

welll... i just finished re-finishing my tank, one corner was left 
on, 3 broken welds.  I took it to a propane (CENEX) 
supplier/installer/service place to have it inspected to get a 
certificate.  I thought i had to have one but i just got this really 
dumb look from the people and they said that MN doesn't have a 
requirement like that (after i mentioned i saw one of these 
certificates from CA).  

BUT he did say that i MUST keep that label 
plate fastened onto the tank as it was illegal for any supplier to 
fill a tank without the certification label.  He knows fillers don't 
check for it but he said adamantly that it must be affixed to the 
tank.  SO.... i used Extend rust converter underneath the label and 
epoxied the whole thing back on with JB Weld.  I figure the expoxy 
will keep out moisture and oxygen and delay the rust problem.  This 
guy also said the the tanks are inspected and certified AFTER all 
welding is done so that one can't re-tack that label back on without 
voiding the certification-- hence the epoxy.

Since the label was 'sprung' and stuck up quite a bit i filled the 
underside with epoxy and used 2 large hose clamps to torque down the 
label until the epoxy set.  this worked very well.
