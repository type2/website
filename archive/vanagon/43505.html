Subject: Re: 64- 67 Westy Interior Lighting question


Anyone know how the lights that are situated between the louvered windows on
the drivers side of a 
Westy are wired?? Are they wired directly to the battery??

you should be able to turn the lights by the card table in a 64-67 so42 westy
on and off regardless of the key.   i suppose this means wired directly to
the the battery.

the little switch to the left on the speedo pod controls the rear roof
interior light, but not the  extra camper lights.
