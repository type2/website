Subject: RE: Waved by Jetta 3, and add campaigns


   On another add related subject, what the hell is Eagle doing claiming 
they
have originated the &quot;autostick&quot;.  Seems like a friend once had a cursed
Ghia with such a thing,

They did. A friend of mine also had a '69 bug with a three-speed auto-stick.

And, my Mom bought a new Honda Accord in '78, with a TWO-speed auto stick. 
Yeesh.
