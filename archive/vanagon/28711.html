&gt;&gt; Truck, 8.5&quot; width, 14&quot; rim diameter) should fit your wheels at least if
&gt;&gt; they're alloy.  I've been told that these are too wide for the narrower
&gt;steel
&gt;&gt; wheels - you migh want to ask a reoupable tire shop about this.  I've got
&gt;&gt; these tires on my Syncro and they've been great.  I was initially
concerned
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a 27LT8.5-14 tire as your spare?  I find that even a 
&gt;205-70R14 doesn't fit very well in the spare tire area.  I could barely 
&gt;get one in the '80 Vanagon I had, and Kelley McDaniel could barely get 
&gt;the one that I gave him in his '82.
&gt;
Yes, I have a 27LT 8.5-14 as a spare on a stock steel wheel.  I had to
position it just right and push real hard but I got it in there.
