Dave, every day I see dangerous loads going down the road. I meet
murderous drivers with no regard for life. Sometimes a boombox car (not
what I really call them) wakes me up in my sleep. I could continue. I
don't know about where you live, but in Connecticut its hard to see how
the motor vehicle laws are being enforced at all. This crud (yellow
headlights) only seems to matter when you're getting inspected, the rest
of the time it seems like the reality of it is, anything goes. In other
words, I'd say my chances of being called down on this are slim and
none.

At 50 I am just not as worried about this kind of BS as I was when I was
younger.
