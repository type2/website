Subject: CCC's January


I'm still working on it, volks - for Jan. 17-19th.  Thus far, all
places I've been able to turn up (thanks to many of you) have been
too small for us. And the few I found which were the right size
were not available that weekend, which is a 3-day weekend.  And the
one or two which fit our needs were VERY expensive.  So, I'm back
to the drawing board.

Anyone have any ideas/connections?  We're still looking for a cabin-
type, rustic, homey place to rent for all of us to be indoors.  Hopefully
up in the snow - area could be in the mountains anywhere from
Sequoyah all the way to Tahoe, or even closer, like Pinecrest
or Strawberry.  All suggestions welcome
