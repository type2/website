Subject: Tinting Upadate &amp; Joels response

Well I've decided to have the whole van tinted (don't  pop
off, no not the windshield too).  Thanks for all the input.
Joel replyed directly with personal knowledge/experience on
doing it yourself.  Don't even want to think about how difficult
it would be to do the window behind the closet!.  I've included his
input below.
Martha- about scratches,  try cutting a potato in half and rub
it on them.  It should take them out.  (sounds like a tip from
Sueanne Givens).


&gt; &gt;#4 - Also, a while back I asked about tinting Vanagon windows.  Well
&gt; &gt;a. a darker tint (75% grey) all windows except driver side and
&gt; &gt;   passenger side.  i.e. everything behind doors.
&gt; &gt;b. a medium tint  (60% grey) all windows.
&gt; &gt;Your input would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; ha. THIS i did do already. i chose a. in any event, i would recommend that
&gt; the rearmost rear hatch window be tinted darker/darkest of all ... it really
&gt; helps your eyes by dimming the headlights of those idiots with their jacked-
&gt; up trucks.
&gt;
&gt; ok. cautions: it helps to cut the tint on the OUTSIDE of the car, to get the
&gt; shape and size approximately right. especially do this on the rear hatch
&gt; window, cause with the defroster grid, you don't want to be cutting with a
&gt; blade.
&gt;
&gt; the sliding side windows are a bitch. at least the part that slides. cause it
&gt; has that little handle-thingie. be super careful. measure many times.
&gt;
&gt; vanagons/buses are MUCH easier to do ... cause all the windows are FLAT. :)
&gt; but you need to do two things most of all to get a really really good job:
&gt; - CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN the glass. then clean it again.
&gt; - when you spray the water on the glass, also spray it on the tint. then when
&gt;   you spread the tint on the glass, and start squeegeeing the water out,
&gt;   KEEP SQUEEZING the water out for a long time. do it like four or five times.
&gt;   the more water you can get out from under there, the better it will stick
&gt;   and the less chance you'll have of bubbles showing up. all those cars with
&gt;   badly bubbled tint are cause the doer didn't get enough water out.
&gt;   now, on the rear hatch window, there will be a 'bubble-line' along each
&gt;   defroster line. nothing you can do about it. just squeegee as much water as
&gt;   you can out ... but because the defroster grid is a 'bump' on the glass,
&gt;   you WILL get that little air space. if you get enough water out, it doesn't
&gt;   look bad, and you can't really see it unless you get really close.
&gt;
&gt; a thought: i made my own front windshield tint, for the top 8 inches of the
&gt; glass ... to shade my eyes when driving into the sun. you'll have to do it
&gt; in two pieces (because the front windshield curves too much for one big piece)
&gt; but it looks ok if you mate the pieces right behind the rearview mirror ...
&gt; that way, the split-line is not really noticeable. the mirror gets in the
&gt; way a little bit, but it can be worked around.
&gt;
&gt; good luck.
