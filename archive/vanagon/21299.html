&gt; &gt;&gt; happens. More of a chance in a couple of more weeks. So, any 
&gt; &gt;&gt; suggestions on where to static time my stock 1600dp with 009, Weber
&gt; &gt;&gt; progressive, single QP. I am at about 1,200 feet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;On a Solex equipped 1600DP, 009, etc, 10degrees before TDC is the right
&gt; &gt;starting place.  I don't know about Weber progressives.

&gt; I dunno, I thought the stock 1600 with stock compression (7.3:1) was
&gt; supposed to be 7.5 BTDC.  10 might be pingy and hot, especially on hills.
&gt; Maybe add a touch for the 1200 feet, and a touch for premium if you promise,
&gt; another touch if the Weber's are really happening and you can work your way
&gt; up to ten, but I wouldn't *start* there.  Better to start more retarded than
&gt; over advanced, I speak from experience.  What was the deck height?  Heads
&gt; are stepped or not?  Barrel shims?  Compression was calculated or just
&gt; guessing? 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it's me, Mr. over-advanced, saying this.
&gt; 
OK.  I run a 1600DP w/ 009 at 5000' in a '70 #230XXXXXXX with a setting of 
12.0 degrees BTDC per the recommendation of the FLARS.  10 seemed to make 
it run hot, 7.5 was &quot;el sluggo&quot; off the line with reduced power.  

Most of my travelling is to them thar hills (6000'-10000'), so a bit of 
extra timing advance seems to be to my advantage.  BTW the valves have 
yet to get tight (even the venerable #3!), compression is just fine,  and no 
overheats (clunk, clunk, clunk--sound of me knocking for luck 
on my padded dash).

The point, you ask?   12.0 BTDC _at_ 5000' = OK; 10.0 _at_ 1200 = hmmmm, maybe 
set it back a little.

p.s.  It's Friday, isn't it?
