&gt;
&gt;&gt;Woo-hoo! First post! Hi all!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm wondering if anyone has had a problem with cracking in their
&gt;&gt;cylinder head or block. What were the symptoms and how did you locate it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Im doing a thesis at the University of Toronto in collaboration with
&gt;&gt;Volkswagen Canada Remanufacturing to test cylinder heads for leaks and
&gt;&gt;cracks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you know the particulars of a test like this, technical details such
&gt;&gt;as mounting hardware or test process/design, that would really be
&gt;&gt;appreciated. Specifically, how was the apparatus mounted to the head/engine?
&gt;&gt;

&gt;Jason,
&gt;
&gt;I've been a shadetree mechanic for many years and during my teen years did
&gt;my share of engine dismantling and rebuilding.  I curently pick and choose
&gt;what I do to my cars now but due to family committments, job, etc I can't
&gt;get out to the garage to do all that I would like.  Anyways my point in
&gt;telling you all this is that I'm not a professional mechanic but I have
&gt;done my share of mechanics.
&gt;
&gt;So here goes,
&gt;
&gt;Here are some approaches to checking and diagnosing cracks in cylinder
&gt;heads and blocks:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Cylinder compression check
&gt;2.  Do you have coolant in your oil or do you have oil in your coolant?
&gt;3.  Professional Approaches include:
&gt;    a)  Hydraulic pressure
&gt;    b)  Magnetic inspection of ferrous parts
&gt;    c)  Dye penetrant
&gt;
&gt;The professional approaches to checking for cracks all require dismantling
&gt;and thorough cleaning of these parts prior to inspection.  I don't think
&gt;there are any easy ways to check and locate cracks when the engine is in
&gt;the vehicle, although maybe technology of today has an approach to this.
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck
