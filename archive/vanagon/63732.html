Subject: gauges (what next?)

When I was re-doing the dash a bit on my '81 Westie, I added a spot for
three gauges.  I have put in a head temp gauge, and a voltmeter.  I would
like some advice as to what gauge to put into the third hole.  Oil temp?
Oil pressure?  Tachometer?  Something else?

Thanks,
