Subject: welcome message

I've changed the list's welcome message by adding the following text:

This is list is dedicated to the discussion of Volkswagen Vanagons, Buses
and campers.

As a curiosity and a service to the electronic community,
Joel Walker (jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu) is compiling a list of where the bricks 
are electronically and geographically.  If you have not already done so, 
and you don't mind that being public information, please send him an e-mail 
with make and model and location.

The vanagon mailing list has proven to be quite busy lately.  Since it
really isn't University business, I try to minimize my time running the
list.  To that end, if mail to you bounces several times, I may without
telling you, remove your name from the list.  At that point, your best
course of action is to send mail to owner-vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
explaining your e-mail situation so I can add you as an alias.

Welcome to the list!
