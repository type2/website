Thanks Dave!  I was hoping it would be something cooler, but now I know 
the full details behind my '66 MicroBus.  I have the above two plus M114 
- Six Hinged Side Windows.

Ok, I will. :-P  With seat mounts gone from my MicroBus (due to rust it 
would seem), how do I determine which seats were originaly in the back 
and was it an 8 or 9 seater?
