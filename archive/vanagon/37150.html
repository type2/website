&gt; &gt; Hp (SAE net) _at_ rpm          67 _at_ 4200              48 _at_ 4200
&gt;                                                      ^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever tried installing one of these in a riding lawnmower?
&gt; I can see where it might be a little underpowered for a loaded down bus 
&gt; climbing the Rockies, but in a Snapper!! Yeah buddy!
&gt; 
&gt; Steve? 

No, Steve took the wasserboxer from the V6anagon and put it in his 
Chop-top Mustang!  

And we thought it was a crime to put an American Engine in a German 
vehicle.  Just what would those boys in Detroit do if they saw his 
Mustang!  No the picture is too ugly to think about!
