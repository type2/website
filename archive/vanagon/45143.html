i seem to recall rusty van bondo parted with a rather *princely
sum* for a nos one? care to comment mr. rvb??

VanBondo replies:
&quot;Yup.&quot;

Ellis says:
I haven't seen the WBW mats but I thought that they were flat and with out
the waffling. I *think* that the rep for WBW who was at the Phoenix College
show in March may have said that the mat *did* have waffling. I opted for
the NOS partly because the mats that I had seen cost $75.00, had no
waffling, included a hole for the hi-lo switch that wasn't cut out and it
was called a '67 mat. A real '66-67 mat will reflect a continuious pattern
w/o indication for the hi-lo switch placement.

BTW **This comment was not related to the WBW mat!!**

The other option was a couple of purchases through the internet which turned
out with mixed results. I threw one of them away after it arrived, the other
will be a nice keeper for a spare in case I wanna switch them out for some
reason. If the WBW mat had waffling I surely would have gladly saved the $$$.
