Hi folks

Thanks for all the help and good words about installing a new exhaust
on my Westy!

Seems the going wisdom is that I must use the hi-temp metal compression
gaskets that VW specifies (Part 443-253-115B for the trivia-minded).

Additional wisdom from Bob Hoover - brass or bronze exhaust studs,
hi-temp anti-sieze on all the parts, and hi-temp Permatex gasket stuff
too.

Yet more wisdom from H Steven Dolan - check the exhaust hangers now
and replace them if they need it.

Thanks again - I'll follow up with any experience of the new one-piece
exhaust system from JC Whitney!

	TTFN
