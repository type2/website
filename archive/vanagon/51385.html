&gt;Thanks to all who sent info regarding stalling vanagons(Haunted 84 hi top
&gt;camper) .  I have changed the coil, did the capacitor harness
&gt;modification, changed fuel filters, sensor two.
&gt;Problem still persists, but manifests itself slightly differently.  For
&gt;the last few days, since the new coil, it occasionally stumbles at mid
&gt;range throttle after running for a while, (12-15 mi) usually whem exiting
&gt;the freeway.  I can pump the gas, to get it to &quot;catch&quot;, then floor it, it
&gt;hesitates, then takes off to full throttle.  The problem is then gone,
&gt;until the next strange occurance.
&gt;Please help.  It's now harder to diagnose, as it does not cpmpletely stop
&gt;and strand me, as it was doing before for 30 minute&quot;rest stops&quot; prior to
&gt;the coil and capacitor fixes.

&gt;P.S. I found h-4 headlights for the camper at the junkyard.  Be on the
&gt;lookout for 914's and similar sports cars with hidden headlights...you
&gt;can manually roll 'em open, often to find hidden treasures!  Happy
&gt;hunting.

I don't feel very qualified to respond to this problem except that it is
reminiscent of my own trials a few months ago when mechanics and others
suggested replacement of a lot of the electrical components (distributer,
throttle switch, air flow sensor etc, but not coil!). Eventually the
problem was traced to the computer and after about $1500 I am once again
trouble free. In my rendition, there was an occasional hiccup at highway
speeds, but more often an inability to restart after short runs, without
letting the vehicle sit for 15-30min (eventually overnight).
    These problems are very agravating, for sure.

Good luck, Nelson Hogg
