Subject: gex rebuilds

          motor on my '66 kombi is out and apart.  it was a 1600SP
          with a 28PICT-1 in a universal T1,2,3 case with a doghouse
          cooler.#4big end bearing spun and became part of the crank.
          there are two cylinder studs on #3 that came out in my hands
          (no wrench required), two helicoils in cases, several small
          cracks in cases, cracked head, and the cam shows wear.  the
          carb has a worn throttle shaft.
          i'm looking for a long block plus a carb.  gex offers a 1600
          SP with dual oil relief.  i'm thinking about putting a
          31PICT-3 on it.  any experienced opinions on quality and
          customer service on these motors and about my carb choice?
          the bus already has converted to 12v.  what do you think
          about flushing the existing oil cooler and using it again?
          if i end up replacing oil cooler is the extra $ for german
          vs brazilian worth it?   thanks ray
