Subject: Engine Coolant Gauge


Two minutes after I start my 85 Vanagon the temp gauge redlines and blinks
indicating a serious meltdown. I checked the coolant levels and everything
seems to be ok. It is leaking from both heads but diminishes when the
motor is warm. Is there a way I can easily determine if the idiot light is
malfunctioning. I am getting a new motor but it is 500 miles away. The
light goes off before the motor is even remotely warm. The engine runs
normal but I have not let it run for more than a few minutes given the
potential severity of the problem. Any advice would be appreciated.

A definite Newbie

-Mike
