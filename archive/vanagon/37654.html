I've a copy of Porters book for Porsches, same title.  On that basis I'd say 
buy the book, mine is good, thorough. It is a good specific book, don't buy 
the generic Haynes body repair manual, not worth it. 


&gt;P.S. The quest is on to find books related to Wilma that cost less than the
&gt;$80+ as in Vanagon      manuals that include the 1980-83 Westfalia models.

Haynes make an aircooled vanagon manual, I like their books, 2nd to Bentley. 
 Haynes manuals are $18-20 CDN but often (3-4x/year) go on sale for 1/2 
price at chain FLAPS+ here.
