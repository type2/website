Subject: '61 crew cab value

Hello Everyone,

        I'm a relatively new member of the list from Portland, OR.  I have a
1981 Vanagon that I bought this March, returning to the ranks of VW owners
after a 15 year hiatus.  (In 1980 I sold the 1965 bus that I lovingly
rebuilt while I was in college in San Diego.)  Anyway, I'm glad to be a VW
owner again, and appreciate all the good information that shows up on this
list - thanks to all.

        This week I had the vanagon in for some minor repairs, and spied a
crew cab pick-up in the old &quot;brick&quot; body style (is this a Kombi?).  I've
always had a soft spot in my heart (head?) for these unique beaties, so I
looked it over.

        Generally it is in good shape and looks clean and straight.
Apparently it came to Oregon from Texas recently.  I found evidence of bondo
work in the rear quarters (my '65 had it too) and along the seam where the
bed pan and the sheet metal body side wall come together, below the folding
cargo area side doors.  There was also a perceptible crack all along this
joint.  Otherwise it looked pretty sweet, missing only the rear bumper.  I
had the garage owner put it up in the air, and I checked out the underside.
As usual, the front pan was missing, one heater box control arm was missing,
and there was the usual seepage of engine and gear oil, but nothing that
looked expensive(?)

        The little beauty was in for some fuel delivery problems (and crud
in the tank) as well as wiper motor, fuel gauge and misc. items.  I heard it
run, and it sounded pretty good, but I have not driven it.

        The truck is for sale, and the owner is asking $ 3,500.00.  I have
no way of knowing if it is worth the money, and was hoping that some of you
would chime in with your thoughts.  I'm interested in this old survivor b
us/truck, but I'm fairly ignorant about them as specific models.  I'd
appreciate anything you would care to share.

TIA,
- Bill Devlin
