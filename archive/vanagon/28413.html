&gt;I think VW has a recall on the Jetta heater cores or assists
&gt;in some way.  Maybe you should check it out.

&gt;yug

I was under the impression it was the hoses to the core
which (under certain circumstances) break and spew hot
liquid all over the passenger compartment.  In view the
location of such hoses in wasserboxer Vanagons I *have*
wondered about the possibility myself.

The plastic cover for the front heater core (blasted
plastic) has broken and I removed it.  When I look down I
see two coolant hoses and get leary of the same thing
happening to me.

Rubber still seems pliable (original '84) and soft, but I do
have to wonder.  Anyone else with a wasserboxer have this
concern?  This problem?
