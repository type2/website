&gt;I would appreciate more info on Delta Six.  I do not know of these people
&gt;and I do not know why ??  Not running in the right circles I presume.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;

You obviously haven't looked on the inside of the door flaps for the water,
city water, and 120VAC connections.  Of course, this is made much easier by
having the door fall off in your hand...  The words Delta Six Industries
appear there without an address.  Obviously, these guys are the
manufacturers of the doors.  Barry and Joel have provided us with phone
numbers and mailing addresses.  If you don't have them, here they are again:
