Subject: Re: Gas Heaters for sale

 Hi to all!

(Got this message in another list)


&gt;I have 2 BN2 Eberspacher gas heaters for sale. They came out of a '69 bug
&gt;and a '70 bug. I have cleaned up the cases, reset the gap on the fuel pumps,
&gt;and cleaned the glow plugs - they are in working order.
&gt;
&gt;I am asking $75 US + shipping for each heater, or best offer.
&gt;
&gt;Gas Heaters for sale

 The questions are:

 Could any of these heaters be used in a 1956 Kombi? Are they VW standard
for vehicles with factory gas heaters? Is this a good price? The local VW
dealer couldn't help me and neither did VWoA. Your help is appreciated. Thanks!
