Subject:       Final Report: Help on brake drum.

&gt; &gt;Replacing a rear brake cylinder in my friends '65 Kombi.  I can't 
get 

&gt; &gt;the brake drum off for the life of me.  Tried a hammer, lots of 
WD40, &gt; &gt;etc.

I thought I would report to all on the brake drum problem:

I was unable to get the brake drum off, after all sorts of creative 
avenues were taken, including: fully loosening brakes, hammer, torch, 
over-tightening,  pulley puller, etc.

Regarding the wheel/pulley puller, I rigged it up to fit in the lug 
bolt holes, and tightened it up.  It was insane; it just acted like a 
drill, and started to bore out the axle!

I gave up, and my friend took it to the local VW shop.

Well it turns out that even with the &quot;proper&quot; wheel puller, they 
couldn't get it off.  It is apparently rusted very badly.  So the 
shop is going to take off the gear box, and try to get it off, or 
else we replace the whole thing.  Pretty crazy if you ask me.

The fellow at the shop thinks that a bearing is seized, broken or 
something, because the axle wobbles a little bit (1/16&quot;)  I told my 
friend that sounded odd, as the axles on my '67 are a little wobbly.

Anyhow, I guess I am happy because I am vindicated, and am not 
totally incompetent.  Too bad for my friend.  I am sure the bill will 
be plenty.
