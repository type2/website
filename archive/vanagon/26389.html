Subject: Re: Vans in europe?

&gt;Does anyone have any information about buying a camper in europe, using 
&gt;it there for the summer, and selling it at the end of the summer?

You can try it with classified ads or going to a dealer. There are a few 
dealers who specialized in Campers and always have some Campers to sell.

But the crucial problem is how to sell it at the end of your trip. Because 
you MUST sell it at a certain time and you HAVE to find a buyer.

&gt;Buying a van in Germany, and presumably other continental countries, means
&gt;big bucks. They have stiff inspection criteria, so most vanagons have
&gt;already melted away. Prices are out of sight for used cars, as the eastern
&gt;european market (and Balkan and Near Eastern) holds a steady demand for
&gt;used vehicles.

This is not true anymore. Prices have stabilized over the last two years.

There are also still lots of vanagons driving around there.
