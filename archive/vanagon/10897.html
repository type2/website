Subject: Re: stripped cap-screws on the CVs...

&gt;&gt;I had to saw the head off one particulary stubborn bolt. Once the CV joint 
&gt;&gt;was off, the rest of the bolt was easy to unscrew by hand.

&gt;I say ... drill them.  The socket head assures you're in the center of the 
&gt;bolt head, and if you drill untill the cap falls off, your'e done.

I tried to drill it out but there wasn't much room to get the drill in 
position. But be warned, it's arm breaking work wielding that hacksaw over 
your head.
