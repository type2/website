Subject: Re: scale wieghts 


	Hi, all!
	When I get the motor into my pick-up (This or next weekend :-) )
I'm supposed to take it for a smog-check and for a trip to a state
approved wiegh-master. So when I do this, I'll ask about people
just wanting to know what their vehicles wiegh.
	One of the cold-storage warehouses along Old Oakland Road
has a sign reading &quot;Public Scale&quot;- I'd guess they have a scale certified
for trade.
