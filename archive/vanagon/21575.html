Subject: RE: How to clean WHITE on a POP top
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 95 13:48:59 EDT

Make sure you bring a ladder and lots of quarters if you go the high
pressure route. The sides are easy to clean, the top difficult unless you
can reach...

...I just painted the roof of my poptop with boat enamel - nice and white
but tough to paint (3 coats -semi gloss) I
would recommend that people check out the trim for rusting before washing
or painting. Putting a bead
of all weather clear silicone along the edge where the poptop meets the trim
keeps water from rusting the embedded clips. BTW Bondo the company makes a
DIY gelcoat - called gelcoat- for resurfacing fiber glass boats. I chose to
not go that route because of the costs and error factor working outside.
After putting ona new seal and paint,
the fit at the front was so good that it filled with water afHter the last
big storm; I had to &quot;break&quot; the seal with a ruler. The seal is from Vee
parts in SD. David S. drove me in his very fast 5.0 Mustang (very fast!) when
visiting La Jolla last winter.

If you have never
removed the front luggage carrier do so - you would be amazed what collects
under there - leaves, branches, algae etc (less so if you park in a garage
I guess).
To solve this problem I glued small pieces of screen to the underside of
each hole - peaked in the middle so debris can't collect there. Water
flows out the junk stays put.
