&gt;Howdy,

&gt;I recently replaced the top window rubber for the passenger side of my van.
&gt; When I took off the old rubber, it was adhered to the front gasket
&gt;somehow.  Now there are two little flaps of rubber that should be glued to
&gt;the new gasket.
&gt;
&gt;Any idea what sort of adhesive I should use?
&gt;

Ron,

3M makes a whole line of adhesives.  I've used their Weatherstrip adhesive
with
great success while restoring my Datsun and Mustang.  Should be able to
find the
stuff at Kragen/PepBoys...
