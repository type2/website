Subject: Re: Silver socket stuff

&gt;Howdy all...
&gt;I'm in Germany right now, and found a store in munich that sells the 
&gt;silver socket parts pretty cheap.  They have extra sockets, and plugs, 
&gt;and a universal plug that functions as a regular cigarette lighter plug, 
&gt;or a DIN plug.
&gt;
&gt;So, if anyone wants any extra silver socket stuff let me know.  I'll 
&gt;pick up some.

 Exactly, what is this silver socket stuff and for what year vehicles?
