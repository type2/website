Hmm. I'll give Mr. Wagner Michael the benefit of the doubt-(He must be 
relatively new to the list!) and not assume he's an ignorant sh*thead.
The SPIRIT of the vanagon list is that such posts are allowed (and a
little bit encouraged on Fridays, anyways!) and we are a fun-loving
bunch. We have to be. We're driving big boxes on wheels, with horridly
inadequate horsepower. Now THAT'S funny. What's even funnier is that we
don't take ourselves too seriously--how can we? Lighten up, please.
