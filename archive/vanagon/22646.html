Subject: Air Tools: Do they blow or do they ROCK?



Citizens:

I think I've stared at the bus long enough.  I think I can see it now, the
way she will be when I'm finished with her.

I'm about to embark upon a ground-up restoration of a 1977 Westfalia that
will be extremely comprehensive including an engine overhaul, some body
work, surface rust removal (and whatever lurks beneath the window rubber),
and perhaps even paint, which brings me to the one last decision to make
before I dive in.  Citibank (heh heh- the fools) just sent me, as planned,
a nice new VISA card with a healthy  limit, which is yet more evidence of
the benefits of marrying a woman with good credit.  So:  should I invest
the $600-$700 for a decent compressor and air tools?

I owned several Beetles when I was in High School and college that poverty
forced me to maintain in less than honorable ways.  I swore that if I ever
owned another VW it would only be when I could do it the *right* way.  I'm
not stupid enough to try to use air tools for everything; last night I
actually had a nightmare about going to remove a head stud with an air
ratchet and accidentally tightening instead, horribly bending the head!
But still, I remember so many times with my Beetles when I wished I had air
power.  I phoned my Dad last night and he seemed to think it un-necessary,
&quot;like having a milking machine for just one cow-- it takes about the same
amount of time as doing it by hand and afterwards you have to clean the
machine.&quot;  But he then reminded me that he wasn't speaking from experience
with either VWs or air tools...

Thus my first appeal to the list.  For those who have air, do you like it?
Is there anyone out there who invested in air and later wished that they
hadn't?  Is there anything out there I should avoid?  Thanks in advance for
your feedback.

Regards,

Peter.
