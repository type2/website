Mark,

That's where my '84 used to leak.  I use AlumaSeal and others on this list 
recommend BarsLeak.  I chose AlumaSeal because I felt that the powdered 
aluminum might be sacrificial instead of the heads corroding.  After 18 
months without further leaking, it started to ooze again, so I added the 
second dose of AlumaSeal and no more leak.

Others have cautioned that leak stopping products may be hazardous to the 
radiator.  However, I live in Phoenix with days above 110 and have not 
overheated yet.  Yes, I run the air conditioning.

Mike
