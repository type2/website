Subject: Maine Vacation / Bike racks



Thanks to all the listmembers who answered my call on advice about a
Maine Vacation.  I got a lot of useful advice, and I'm sorting through
them.  I also got an extra week to prepare, since my wife discovered
she had committed to work the weekend of August 1st.  So, we'll be
going Aug. 4th through Aug. 7th.

All the bike rack on the list reminded me of something:  Maybe I can
make use of the mounting bolts on the rear bumper....  The trouble is,
I do not know if they are there...  On the '82, there are four (two on
each side) bolts that hold the chrome bumber in place.  The '87, being
the grand Wolfsburg Edition, has the plastic cover on the bumpers.  I
imagine underneath it must be all the same, but I thought I'd ask
before I hack.   Does anyone know what the bumper mounts are like
underneath the plastic covers?  How easy are the plastic covers to
take off and put back on?  I'm thinking of putting 2-inch diameter
holes on the plastic to 'extend' the home-built mounting plates
outside the plastic so that I can bolt a bike rack frame whenever I
need it.  Any ideas?  

Thanks,
Cetin
