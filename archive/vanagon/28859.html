Subject: Heater boxes, overalls, gasoline politics

	Friends,
	I bought two west-coast (cheap) used heater boxes this
morning for $25 each at VW Used Parts Center. He had 4 lefts and
only one right... said it was that kind of day. I didn't blow
through 'em, but I did look 'em over and move the lever while
watching the flaps. Flaps moved smoothly and there was no rust
inside. The sheet-metal jacket is slightly loose on one.
I'll give 'em a complete inspection tonight, and clean 'em up
with hot, soapy, water. (Good suggestion, Sami!)

	I believe the DFO welded three-bolt-flanges onto the
heater boxes I have now, so I'm faced with either transfering
the flap + lever assembly to the gussied-up boxes or having
someone weld mine. The flanges are GREAT and I'm keeping them!
If I want to have the welding done, any recomendations who to take 
it to in the South Bay? 
	Bob Kenyon, do you or Al weld? What if I buy pizza? 

	I've 'heard' that the Danish ones had thick wall tubing rather than
the big cast-iron-over-tubing assembly inside the sheet-metal covers.
Thus less heat and more likely to leak dangerously. Is it possible
this refers to the JC Whitney items? These rumors lead me to buy
a used but presumably buff part. They're as heavy as the OEM units :)
Reading this thread I get the impression the the Danish items are
well regarded by people who actually bought them.


	Either way, when I'm done, I'll have two spare, used, heater boxes
that need flap-lever-repairs. I'd be happy to pass them on to someone
who needs 'em. You pick 'em up or pay postage.



	My beloved brother carried coveralls in his cars- one pair
per car, so he need never get greasy when dealing with emergencies.
That kind of thinking usually leaves few emergencies to boot. So
I bought myself a nice pair of coveralls, white, for $27 or $34 or
some number like that, at the local workingpersons supply store.
EXCELENT for prospecting at Pick and Pull.


	Oh, and speaking of political gasoline buying, my current
vendor (Shell) is one of the largest producers in Nigeria... which
just hanged a group of environment/human-rights activists... so
I may have to take my $100/month gasoline habit somewhere else.
