Hey all,
	I have a couple quick questions.  1), how do you get the
	speedometer cable out?  2) I'm not too clear from looking at
	Bentley how to adjust the parking brake.  Can someone clear this
	up for me?  3) How do you hook up the air conditioning belt?  By
	the way, this is for a '78 bus.  

	I guess that's all for now.  Please reply directly as I don't
	seem to be receiving list mail.  Thanks in advance for any help.

	Sean
