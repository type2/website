Subject:      Re: brain board needed for 87 Westy

Gail,

Could well be the ECU - I had same symptoms years ago in my '87 and it was the
control unit. You could tap on the box (or jiggle it when unmounted but
connected) and the engine would stop. The original in mine was made for VW by
Triumph-Adler, not Bosch. Replaced with Bosch and has been OK since.

Bus Depot has new units at good prices - call Ron Salmon at (610) 754-8989.
