 Hi Joel,
	I too will be sort of busy both Sat and Sun. but I will
be kind of in and out on Sat. . Let me know hows it going. I can
be reached at home at 256-7360. I am right in town so it would
be neat to see that stuff when you get it. By the way, is that
'77 the bus that was parked out there somewhere on theEast side
I believe on Washington Ave. I remember seeing one sitting there
too by some kind of shop (domestic) looking kind of out of
place. Hope to hear from you.   guntram
