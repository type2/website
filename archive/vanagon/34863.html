Clay,

&gt; 64 Kombi  - solid, painted black, little rust, I wasn't to interested in this 
&gt; bus so the price slipped by but I think he said $2000

This isn't the same one that was in the paper the other day for some 
crazy amount ($4k) is it?
 
&gt; 56 Oval Ragtop - Unknown 
&gt; 
&gt; Call Eric at 801-756-8646

Haha!  Eric's Oval.  He'll want top dollar for it.  He's done a lot 
of good finding for me.  In fact he restored my friend's '64.  
(Pretty good work for the price)

You might be one to ask:  I'm looking for a real shop to sandblast my 
'57, and work from there, _PROPERLY_.  Eric is into the quick jobs, 
not what I'm looking for.

TTYL,

- Mike White
