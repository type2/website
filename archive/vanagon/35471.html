Subject: Better brakes for early buses

Mike and the list

You'll be happy to know a couple of us are working on a retro-fit to install
the brake booster from a late model bus to earlier models.  No major problems
encounters so far. The mod will call for welding a couple of brackets
(booster and steerng damper) and fabricating a new rod from pedal to booster,
plus the new plumbing so far we've encountered nothing that compromises a
safe installation nor anything requiring more than a moderate level of skill
to effect the installation.  

No other data at this and inquiries are NOT invited.  We'll probably offer a
do-it-yourself article for posting to the net but may try to make a little
money by producing a video plus instruction manual.
