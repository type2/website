Subject: Engine build info. please

     Can anyone make a list of all the major parts I need to build a 
     reliable 1835 type I motor.
     
     I have a set of 40/44 Dual Kadrons - but that's it up to now. Don't go 
     suggesting I should buy Twin Dellortos - I think that the money I 
     could spend on carbs with a better name could be put towards building 
     in strenght and longevity to the case and cranks etc. Ok the solex's 
     that Kadron use are Brazilian, but with the right kind of care and 
     maintainence they can remain reliable whilst doing the same job as the 
     Dellortos. I don't have an unlimited budget but I will be going for 
     new case, strong crank, performance cam and oil pump and big valve 
     heads.
     
     any ideas (Neal, Heath, Andy, anyone ...)
     
     Lee.
