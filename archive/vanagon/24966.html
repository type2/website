Subject: Cheap fixes for skylight lift mechanism

Ajax had asked about new lift mechanism for his '87 Westy.
Well if the mechanisim still goes up and down but does not
stay in the aluminum track that is attached to the roof vent,
there is hope to fix it :)

The basic problem is that the aluminum washers that were 
attached to the lift mechanism's arms have worn away.
My vent had this problem as well as closing on its own over 
long trips and it would rattle like hell and make a lot of 
noise.

To fix it you need two bolts, four nuts, two lock washers,
and four fender washers; all size #8, some Loctite, some
silicon sealer and some grease.

Start by removing the entire roof vent and lift mechanisim from
the roof, hinges included. Why, because its much easier to work 
on this at your workbench/kithcen table. Drill out the rivets 
that are at the very end of the mechanism's arms. The idea here 
is to replace the rivets with the bolts, washers and nuts. You
may have to drill out the arms a little so the bolts can go
through it. Keep the little bushings, you'll need those during
reassembly. Now slip a fender washer on one of the bolts, followed
by one of the bushings. Try to put this in the track that is on
the roof vent. If the fender washer is too big you will have to
cut them down with a pair of sheet metal cutters. Be sure to file
off any ruff edges. So you have a screw with one fender washer,
a bushing, in the aluminum track, now add another fender washer,
the lift mechanisim's arm (with drilled out hole). Make sure you
have the mechanism in the correct orientation. Put some Loctite 
on the bolt's threads, one nut, one lock washer and another
nut. Tighten together so the nuts won't come loose. Also put 
some grease on the aluminum track so that washers/bushing can
slide easily on it.

Repeat for the other arm. Sounds like alot, but its not too bad.
To put it back on the roof, start by cleaning the mounting holes
in the pop top and putting some sealer around/in them. Install the
bolts for the hinge first then the bolts for the lift mechanisim.

If all goes well the vent should go up and down smoothly. It may 
still rattle some but not as much as it use to and it should not
come down on its own any more.

Good luck,
