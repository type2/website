&gt; do you guys realize what you are suggesting? a piece-meal non-contiguous
&gt; Cannonball Rally. sort of. only played at 33-1/3 rpm. :)
&gt; 

Maybe it could be a kind of event like the prelude to the olympics,
where the torch is passed from one runner to the next.

We could pass a hubcap or something similarly valuable.

Or the song-book?  That way if there are gaps, the songs could be 
emailed to the next point.
