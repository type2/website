Subject: Re: Blowing Coolant Hoses Right and Left 

I had to replace a/the main hose from front radiator to the engine in an 
'85 Westphalia about 4 years ago; cost $300.

&gt; I've got an '85 with 128k and have not had to replace any hoses. Am I
&gt; just lucky? I've heard about the tremendous cost of the coolant hoses.
&gt; Does anyone have a breakdown on the hoses and prices?
