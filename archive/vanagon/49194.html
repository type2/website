Subject: Question for the Vanagan expert

Could folks give this guy some advice?  I have no idea what prices are like,
though this seems high to me...

I'm getting ready to make an offer on a 1980 Vanagan Westy, 125K but 
only 5K on new (remanufactured) engine, no body rust, OK interior, stove 
&amp; frige work, no AC.  

What do you think this one would be worth on the East Coast?

He wants $5900, which I think is high.

If you could reply today, even with just a WAG as to a reasonable price, 
it would be GREAT as I want to buy a vehicle very Badly this weekend!

Thanks!
