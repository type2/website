Shirley.....would you consider moving to Fresno/Monterey and marry me...you 
won my heart....

I'll even let you drive my diesel Vanagon while we have Wester VW in MOnterey 
put a new power plant in the water boxer!



&gt; 
&gt; My Camper is sick. Joel was kind enough to answer my plea for information
&gt; resources and told me about this list. Thanks in advance for all the
&gt; wonderful support and interesting stuff I anticipate here. 
&gt;  
&gt; I am a single woman, some science training, but no mechanical experience.
&gt; My father was an auto mechanic who would never answer my questions about
&gt; what &amp; why and sent me to the kitchen to do the dishes whenever I asked too
&gt; many questions (which was always). I have rebelled ever since. This is my
&gt; Final rebellion and I need HELP! 
&gt;  
&gt; Pep boys in Santa Maria said we had a blown engine when my daughter got
&gt; stranded there. I live in the Bay area north of San Francisco, so we towed
&gt; it home. Upon inspection, with the help of my technical advisor  Alex
&gt; Ramsay, I am getting educated. Obeying his every command (suggestions
&gt; really) I took out the push rods of 2 cylinders. I saw what they were
&gt; supposed to look like on one, and on the other (offending member) there was
&gt; a portal with ragged metal around where the lifter should be. Alex suggests
&gt; that we do not have the raw material to rebuild this engine. I have been
&gt; getting VW magazines to find what options are available. I have come up
&gt; with the following and would like comments, suggestions, tales of
&gt; experience and/or advice. 
&gt; 1.) Put in another 83 waterboxer engine    
&gt;     pros-it will fit easily 
&gt;     cons-this engine has problems  
&gt;                they are expensive ($1800-1500 price range I've found with
&gt; core return) 
&gt; 2.) Put in a different engine 
&gt;          pros-better engine 
&gt;                    cons-conversion kit needed, possible heating
&gt; modifications,  no manual to                       follow-new territory etc
&gt; etc etc 
&gt;                             Pinto-1971 
&gt;                            Jetta     
&gt;                            Porsch 911 are possibles that have been
&gt; suggested. 
&gt;  Where to get conversion kits &amp; instructions???? 
&gt;  
&gt; I don't want a suped up vehicle but I plan on keeping it a long time. I
&gt; really like its versatility.  I want to learn and I want a good result
&gt; without too much frustration. We do not have a great workshop to work in
&gt; either, I live in a condo with a carport. We have the Bently manual and
&gt; Alex has done this sort of thing before, so my advisor is trusted once we
&gt; decide what to do (I hope). 
&gt;  
&gt; Please tell me everything I need to know. Recommend a place to buy the
&gt; engine if you can that is reliable and low cost. I will be grateful and may
&gt; even send cookies (I know how to do that!) Thanks.
