&gt; &gt; My previous post about &quot;cold start stalling&quot; has turned out to be a bad
&gt; &gt; mass air flow sensor.  VW has one in stock but I can't mortgage my house
&gt; &gt; for that much money!  Does anyone have an aftermarket source for a new
&gt; &gt; (reliable) one that I could get &quot;overnighted&quot; to me?   Appreciate
&gt; &gt; responses, leaving on trip Friday.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

Check with the boys at the Bus Depot;  www.busdepot_dot_com

I believe they have the mass air-flow meters in stock on their web site.
