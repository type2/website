&gt;I followed up on that AC evaporator that was put on. Apparently the evaporator
&gt;this guy had was a VW approved item to be used with AC. He said that that
&gt;usaully the bus AC was located above the driver (is this right?) but this was
&gt;designed for campers that could not locate above and is for under the dash.
&gt;This is not a swamp box but for use with AC compressor. So what is the reality
&gt;for putting a compressor on an upright engine? Seems to me this sucker has a
&gt;tough enough time going up those itty bitty hills without a compressor. Thisk
&gt;I saw a post once that said comprssors take about 5 hp off. What say. Is this
&gt;forbidden fruit?

I have heard that some people put vacuum switches in line with the connection
to their compressor clutches to avoid this problem.  Whenever you are
accelerating or pulling hard, the vacuum in the intake drops.  The switch is
set to open whenever this happens, releasing the A/C clutch and removing the
load from the engine when you need the power.  Anybody here tried this?
