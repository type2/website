Subject: Changing air in camper
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 11:58:35 -0500 (CDT)

In one of Bob Hoover's posts he mentioned the problem of condensation 
inside of a camper.  Two sleeping bodies can put out a lot of water in
eight hours.  I don't like this stuff dripping off the interior panels
of my bus in the morning.

Bob mentioned the idea of using a small fan to exchange the air in the
bus.  I have in mind using something like a computer cooling fan.  Not
wanting to get too adventurous with rigging up electrical things that 
will be operating while I sleep, I went to Radio Shack.  They have two
small 12V fans that will do this job.  These are their specs:

5.3 cfm		80mA	1w	1 9/16&quot;

27  cfm		0.16A	1.9w	3&quot;

A guess has the interior volume at something less than 500 cubic feet.
I haven't put a tape on it.

My '71 campmobile has a T in the main heating pipe.  When I pull a 
level under the drivers seat I can route or unroute a certain amount 
of heat towards the rear of the bus via a vent in the floor.  This 
vent sets right behind and between the front seats.  Under the bus the
air is routed to this vent via one of those aluminum hoses.  This is 
where I propose to tap the system and draw out the air.  I haven't yet
gotten under there and really looked things over, with this in mind, 
but I think I can make something work, being the handy guy that I am.

I guess this makes for three questions:

Is the smaller of these two fans enough to get the job done?  I am 
thinking it would be easier to mount and would less draw on the 
battery.

If number one above is no:  Will the bigger fan run for eight hours 
and leave me with enough battery for starting?  I just installed the 
hugest group 42 battery and overhauled my generator.  What is that amp
hour thing again?

Does the place I have in mind seem like the best and easiest place to 
mount the thing?  It might be less noisy more toward the front of the 
bus but there is no easy opening in the system up there unless you get
under the dash.  Also, I like the idea of drawing the air off the 
floor for some reason.

Comments?
