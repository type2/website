The notes I wrote in my book after i did this test on the gas gauge with
a resistor decade box are as follows:

Gauge reads full : input resistance=210 ohms 
Gauge reads empty: input resistance=35 ohms
The 510 on their gauge corresponds to 340 ohms

Good Luck

&gt;OK, for you technoids out there... anyone got VW1301 tool, seems to be 
&gt;a
&gt;variable resistor that you connect instead of the gauge you are 
&gt;checking.
&gt;What I want to know is what are the resistance values (ohms) that this 
&gt;thing
&gt;puts out at settings of:
&gt;
&gt;        50 - gas tank full / temp gauge at lower edge of red
&gt;        320 - gas tank empty
&gt;        510 - temp gauge at lower edge of white 
&gt;
&gt;and any other settings that might be useful???
&gt;
&gt;Now... why?  because after sticking in a new temp (gauge) sender I get 
&gt;the
&gt;same reading as the old when running AND yes the voltage stabilizer is 
&gt;spot
&gt;on for output, at 10.5v, checked that first, then blew the $21+4tax on 
&gt;a
&gt;sensor, grrrr...  ?? Bad ground straps??
&gt;
&gt;Final questions, 
&gt;
&gt;1) voltage at battery is 14.5 when running, 12.5 when off.  A-OK.  
&gt;Voltage
&gt;at stabilizer is 13.5v running but floats +/- 0.5 volts when idling 
&gt;(fine at
&gt;1500RPM).  So why the floating? bad brushes? (belt fine/tight), out of 
&gt;round
&gt;pulley?  Gremlins?
&gt;2) the 1.0 volt drop is a pain, anyone run a new 'power' line to the 
&gt;fuse
&gt;panel or somehow got rid of this drop.  I don't want to just upgrade 
&gt;the
&gt;headlamp wiring with a new feed, what about new feed to entire 
&gt;dash/front
&gt;area??  Ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks folks, bye, tim
