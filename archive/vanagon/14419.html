&gt;In reply to Mantis' querry whether the EV is a sell out to minivans...
&gt;
&gt;Its obvious you have never driven or probably even seen a EuroVan...
&gt;they handle better, have just as much interior room (if not more
&gt;as far as cubic feet), and more power....
&gt;
&gt;Sell out indeed!


ok youre right, i have never seen a EVan.. the only van i have ever seen in 
my life has been the van on the A team and i think that is a vw bus.. ... 
yeah i have never driven a Euro van, there are many vehicles i havent 
driven.  considering power, they have 5 cylinders right?, just like the 
later vanagons... so power is probably equal..
