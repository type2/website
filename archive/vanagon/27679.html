Well, there's almost no linkage in a Vanagon.  There's a master 
clutch cylinder right behind the clutch pedal, it's fed from the brake 
master cylinder reservoir at the top of the dash.  It then actuates the 
slave cylinder on top of the tranny.

Make sure there's brake fluid in the reservoir first.   From what I hear 
the slave cylinders have a habit of going out.
