&gt; I recently got an Adventurewagen, and compared to a westy it is a little
&gt; sparse on the conveniences.  I think i would like to install a deep cycle
&gt; battery to power one of those electric cooler things (and other stuff),
&gt; and possibly charge the battery with a solar panel.  I have little
&gt; knowledge of electrical systems (other than what I learned in an EE
&gt; class long ago) and wondering if ther is a good resource book about
&gt; 12V systems to get me up to speed.  I'm also wondering if anyone has
&gt; ever used one of those cooler things, and if there may be another
&gt; alternative (other than ice) for keeping my food and beverages cold on
&gt; trips. I have access to westy conveniences (sink, stove, fridge,cabinets)
&gt; from an 83, but I am thinking that trying to put them into my van may be
&gt; more than I can handle.  If it is easier than it seems, please let me know.

Grab the stuff from the 83, man!  It's all one unit, and will fit nicely
in your van behind the drivers seat.  I would have done that if I had
been able to find one at a reasonable price...

BTW, those &quot;kooltron&quot; cooler things stink.  I would hold out for a &quot;real&quot;
fridge instead.
