Subject:       Fare (fair?) price for '90 westy


Kerri Holland described an ad for a 90VW camper in SF, listed at 
$18,500.

Kerri:  We bought what sounds like an IDENTICAL camper just a year 
ago in upstate NY:  Camper, fully equipped, 4 spd, AC, alloy shls, 
stereo, dark blue, one owner, all service records, Immaculate.  It 
doesn't have extra seats (but seats 5, and sleeps 4), and I think it
had around 85K.  We've been extremely pleased with it in all ways, and 
paid $10,000 for it.  We've been told we got a real deal -- but 
$18,500 still sounds pretty steep to me.
