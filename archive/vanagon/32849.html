So Sandy/John Mac/Hopp says:
&gt; Apologies for the late reply, but I have a couple questions to put to 
&gt; the collective net wisdom.  
&gt; 
&gt; 1)	3000 miles on Bosch copper plugs (is that all?)?

That's what the VW official maintenance schedule says.  You may
leave them in longer, but you might pay in the long run.

&gt; 
&gt; 2)	3000 miles on points/condensor/cap n' rotor?

Ditto.
