&gt; So I am appealing to all of you for a bit of a boost... maybe those of
&gt; us not heading for the Artic Circle should start planning next year's
&gt; big caravan...

I think that's a great idea.  These things take a *ton* of planning, as 
the piles of forest service maps and my long &quot;government officials to 
call&quot; list attests.  Christa first had the idea for the Inuvik trip well 
over 1 1/2 years ago, and I'm real glad Ron Lussier jumped in with all 
his incredible support, P.R. shmooze-ability, and HTML skills, since the 
trip would be nothing like the insane size it promises to be without him 
to carry a big chunk of the organizational load.

So: if you want to organize a major trek, start early!  The mechanicals 
with your bus are only part of the challenge, and if you're crazy enough 
to volunteer to organize one of these things, the mechanicals will
be a *small* part of your concerns.

But it sure gives you something to dream about, so it's all worth it!

Northward ho!
