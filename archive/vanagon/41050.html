Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

&gt;I think I have to step in at this point and say that I have ordered from
&gt;Bus boys exactly one time, and the experience was 100% positive.  They


 Believe me, when parts are ordered, the can never get here too fast! I
can't say the stuff (Headliners, seat upholstery, Safari trim) gets here
quick from BBoys, but then NOTHING fom the left side of the country arrives
here in less than a week...

 We deal with most all of the aftermarket suppliers...on a weekly basis and
tho I feel BB to be a bit quick to deposit our checks, and a bit reluctant to
ship off the goods, everthing we've ever ordered from them has been accounted
for...

My groggy opinion

Kevin


btw: Yes, we finally have our &quot;Busbones&quot; address...WebSite soon.......
