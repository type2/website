Subject:      Re: Binding when turning

Mark, I think you have an excellent point.  Not that I wouldn't be sweating
bullets with the thought of a viscuous coupling going bad if I had one....
But just to throw this in there for support on your hypothesis, my 88
Bronco II has what I would call the most binding I ever felt on sharp turns
whether in 4X4 low or high.  It has always done this, and is perfectly
normal.  In fact, when ever I drive in 4x4 high, I just change the transfer
case from 4x4 to 2x4 before pulling into the drive or into parking spaces
just because I don't like the feel of it doing the binding.
