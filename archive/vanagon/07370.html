&gt;A friend of mine had a really cool VW.  It was a phone repair vehicle from
&gt;Germany.  Basically it was a bus on a bug chassis.  ...
&gt;...           We figured it was from the mid sixties based on the running
&gt;gear.  It had Bus type sliding doors on both sides and these extended from
&gt;the front seats back.  ...

ahem. :)  in 1964-65, vw made some little trucks called Fridolin which were
for the Deutsche Bundespost or Federal Post Office. they are exactly as you
describe, but to me the front end looks more like a squareback.

now, way back in 1956, there was a beetle-front-ended similar vehicle, made
for the same postal folks, that had only swing doors. it was called an EA 48
and was put out by Karmann, the convertible and Ghia builders.

a really ugly looking EA 50 was also made around then ... but the front end
looks like the butt end of a hippopotamus. really. :) now it had sliding
doors on the sides.
