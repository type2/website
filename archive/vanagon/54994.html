I agree on this, when I lived in Menlo Park from 91 to 1993, it took me a
long time to get these very good and nice mechanics. At that time, I've
owned a '84 and a '85 Vanagon GL. I had misfiring on the '84, sometimes it
would die completely, I got 2 tuneup at =A7=A3$_at_* mechanics for nothing and=
 at
Fred's, they found the problem very quickly. The guy just changed the spark
plugs caps, not even the wires, and the van ran like a dream! I had these
misfires for weeks before that. The price was almost nothing. Even if you
live far from them, it's definitely worth the trip as Charles says.
Right now, I don't have these kind of problems since my Syncro is a TD
engine. No more misfires, shorts, etc, but still cooling problems anyway.
The head gasket needs to be replaced, oh  well....:(
