  Jeez, Dave, you ask the tough questions. A straight and solid '71 is hard
  to pass up. I'd be a little nervous about taking off on a long trip with a
  motor that has only ten miles on it. And, although I am a big fan of '71s,
  the pancake motor makes for more pleasant &lt;and more rapid, if that matters&gt;
  freeway driving. On the other hand, the upright motor in the '71 has a lot
  less plumbing attached to it and should be simpler and cheaper to repair if  
  required during your trip.  Here in the S.F. Bay Area, $3500 would be a  
  high price.

&gt; Hi all.  I just spotted a 71' weekender in town (Duluth Mn.)  It has a 
&gt; rebult motor (ten miles ago), new carb, new exhaust, new paint job, no 
&gt; rust/bondo (Montana Plates), redone interior, very, very solid.  The asking price is 
&gt; $3500 this seems like too much, what do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; I bought my 73 westy (77'rebuilt 2.0) for $3400 from the same guy and it had 
&gt; about 25 miles on the rebuilt, and a new paint job and custom interior.  
&gt; I am considering trading if its a good deal.  We are planning a long trip soon 
&gt; (to Indiana then on to Taos, New Mexico and back to Minnesota, about 2000 
&gt; Mi) and I think I would feel more comfortable with a stand up motor than the 
&gt; pancake, fuel injected 2.0.  Since I don't know that much about the newer 
&gt; motors I could be making a mistake, what do ya think?
