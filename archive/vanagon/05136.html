&gt;Have any of you out there tried &quot;true&quot; snow tires on your vans? Are there
&gt;van versions of Nokia Hakkapalittas available?

Yep. I been running four NR10s (185 R14 I think) on my 91 Vanagon every
winter since I got it. I don't know if they're any special type for vans.
They have excellent traction in snow and as for handling, I don't drive
too aggressively in snow :-) but for street driving I have no complaints.
I can look up any other information stamped on the tires this weekend and
post next week...
