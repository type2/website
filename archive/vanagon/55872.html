Subject: Oldest Vanagon on the list??

Vanatics,
I was wondering who has the oldest Vanagon on the list?  If you have a 1980
Vanagon and would like to see if your's is the oldest on the list, send your
VIN (vehicle identification number) to me.  I'll keep a list and let the
whole list know the result.  BTW, Skip Montanaro's WWW page shows that VIN:
24A-0013-069 was the first 1980 Vanagon produced.  

If you're reading this from the Type2 list, please email me directly, since I
don't subscribe to that list.

Regards,
Jim Davis
