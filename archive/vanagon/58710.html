Has anyone had experience in adding &quot;driving lights&quot; for daytime use to a
Vanagon?  I always drive with my headlights on but would like to rig some
lights that would come on automatically with the ignition.  Also-our-85
Westy doesn't have the 3rd brakelight.  What do you think about adding one
in the back window?  How hard is it to do?
TIA
