Subject: a confession

          well, installed rebuilt GEX 1600 sp somewhere around july 31
          and fired it up briefly and then took off on my Moto Guzzi
          for the cooler climate of the Smoky Mtns.  got back last
          week and fired the bus up again and it wouldn't stay
          running.  called it quits when the skeeters started to eat
          me alive around sundown.  went out there again on saturday
          and smelled gas.  looked in the compartment and saw a small
          leak in metal fuel line going through firewall.  crawled
          under to pull line from gas tank end and discoverd that the
          vise grips i used to crimp the rubber line when
          reinstalling weeks ago was still intact.  swore then laughed
          then did it right.  replaced the carved line, slipped a
          piece of tubing around it where it goes thru firewall and
          then realized i was lucky the vice grips were there while
          the leak existed. probably saved me from a fire.  it now has
          about 100 miles on the new motor.  will report on valve
          adjustment when i hit the 300 mark.  by the way, the valves
          were adjusted at about .004 from GEX.  couldn't even push a
          .006 thru them.  i wrote a letter about this and other
          potential problems.  have heard nothing yet.  i'll let you
          know.  hey, dave, nice post you trickster, you.  and to
          think i've been taking advice from you, too.  sheesh!!
