this mess (while all you normal people are sleeping, dreaming of sugarplums):

Angle       Elks Wagon
Angel       No Wages
Love        VW Goes
Snow        VW Goals
Gale
New         and, in conversation:              &lt;the anagram&gt;
Wagon       &quot;Hey, Kwang! How goes it?&quot;         &quot;Kwang Loves.&quot;
Elks        &quot;Vat Do Ve Wan?&quot;                   &quot;Ve Wan Klogs.&quot;
