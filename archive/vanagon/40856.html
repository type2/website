Subject: Lee's 60 s/cab update

     Hi folks,
     
     It's a while since I told you all where I was at with my '60 single 
     cab.
     
     Well If you remember I had a problem with the tranny shift. It 
     wouldn't shift into first or second. The guys I bought it off tried 
     fitting a quick shift kit but it didn't make any difference.
     
     Anyway when i finally got time to get under the bus, i found that one 
     of the grub screws on the shift linkage joiner had come undone - i 
     tightened it and the shift was perfect! so i removed the quick shift 
     kit and it was even better, so I changed the tranny oil (it had been 
     leaking through one of the reduction box seals) and it's perfect :)
     
     So I've started to tidy the bus a little now by replacing the hinge 
     pins on the doors, drop sides, loading doors, engine lid. It all feels 
     a lot smoother now.
     
     Just last week though it started running real bad. So I traced it to a 
     blowing j-tube on the left side.
     
     So last weekend i took the engine out to sort it. Get this - the guys 
     who owned it last had attempted to repair the heater tinware around 
     both the j-tubes (this baby's got the original non-freshair heaters - 
     Thom!). Their attempt involved drilling the tinware to join it with 
     aluminum pop-rivets, which was Ok i suppose, but they drilled through 
     the tinware and on through the j-tubes! They then put the pop-rivets 
     in to hold the tinware together which sealed the holes temporarily, 
     but a year later (last week) the rivets finally burnt away and exhaust 
     started blowing. 
     
     Anyway with the engine out, i welded up the holes in the exhaust and 
     repaired the heater box tinware properly, making sure all the flaps 
     and things worked. So now the pickup has heat! and i am impressed by 
     the amount of heat compared to the heat exchangers on my samba.
     
     Question is (Thom, Clara etc..) what is the correct set-up between the 
     heater box and the tube on the body. The length of tube would need to 
     be about 35cm. Am I correct in thinking that the tube consists of a 
     flexible piece and a kind of baffle tube or something, any pre '63 
     buffers know the answer ?
     
     cia
     
     Lee.
