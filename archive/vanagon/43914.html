That's a sure sign of timing being off.  WAY off.  I seriously doubt there
is anything wrong with the basic motor, based on your post.  Line the thing
up at Top Dead Center and make sure the rotor is pointing pretty close to
either the #1 or #3 plug wire.  If it isn't, turn the distributor until it
is.  If the rotor is already pointing at 1 or 3, swap the plug wires over.
Switch 1 with 3, and 2 with 4.  Then try starting the engine again.  This
has ALWAYS worked for me.  Usually, I am off 180 degrees.

p.s. If this doesn't work, suspect your measurement of TDC.  Don't trust
the mark on the fan.  You should be able to tell by looking at the valves -
turning the engine over, TDC will be at the spot about halfway between when
the intake valve closes and the exhaust valve opens.  You can tell
approximately where TDC is by when the motor is easiest to turn.  If you
get this far (valve covers off) do this on #1, and then compare to rotor
position.  Almost foolproof for setting basic timing.
