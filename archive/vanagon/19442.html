Subject: valve adjust Questn

THe last time I adjusted the valves, I incorrectly adjusted one of the 
valves such that you could hear it tapping rather loudy.  I found that one of 
the valve stems sat slightly below the spring retainer washer.  When I had 
first adjusted it, I laid the gauge across the retainer washer and thus the
loosely adjusted valve.  All the others have the valve stems slighly above
the retainer washer.  Should I be concerned?
