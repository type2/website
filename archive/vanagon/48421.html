Subject: vanagon rims

I own a 1987 Vanagon GL and have been looking for rims for it.  The 
probem is they are 5 holes and 112 mm which is apparently a very unusual 
measure.  Hubcaps are out of the question because they are very expensive 
and they have been stolen two times already.  Do you know if I may be 
able to purchase these, and if so, where?
Please reply to jvaldes_at_rimith_dot_com.
Best regards
Julio Valdes, Panama
