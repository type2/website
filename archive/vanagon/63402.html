&lt;&lt; I peeked underneath and found no signs of anything broken, so then
 proceeded to crank the jack.  However, I noticed that my cranking was not
 being translated into downward motion on the jack.  Well, now I knew what
 broke.  I could also not crank the jack up.  Closer inspection revealed
 that the vertical screw which does the raising and lowering had broken up
 at the top, where it attaches to the gear that attaches to the other gear
 which you turn with the handle.

 So now I was stuck.  I had no way of cranking the jack down and I could not
 remove the jack as the van was not lowered all the way.

never trust 'em,
never use 'em.
