Subject: Aarg! Will Drive H2o-Cooled to BBTA

Hi All,

Although I had hoped and wished to bring &quot;Zorm&quot; the '59 Euro Single Cab to
Buses by the Arch, I'll have to opt for my tried and true &quot;Brownie Bus&quot;
'84 GL to take us to BBTA again.  Zorm needed some attention that I
couldn't give it lately (cooling and sifting fixes) and Brownie Bus has
delivered us to midwestern destinations with over 5000 miles under her
belly since the last BBTA on Memorial day weekend.

I spoke to Dave Easterwood on the phone last night and he's heading out in
his 59 Single Cab on a solo journey.  Hope to see many, many list members
there.  We should arrive early Friday evening and stay till at least
Sunday morning, provided my 3.5 year old does not get out of hand!  8-)
