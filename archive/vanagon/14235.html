&gt; Just one simple question....  What were the demographics of this outing 
&gt; (i.e.,Eurospams, bricks, breadloafs, splitties, and types within each 
&gt; category)?  TIA

I think my trip report has a comprehensive list of attendees but I'll 
wing it here:

Bob Kenyon, Al Hubbard, '59 Single Cab Pickup
Dave Schwarze, '74 (?) Baywindow Safari
Sam and Susie Williams,  Baywindow Westy
Jack Stafford, Baywindow Westy
Scott Harvey and Alice, Vanagon Westy 
Alice Gibb and Larry McPhee and kids, Vanagon Westy
Martha Rubin and Bob, Vanagon Westy
Bradley Prunemeister, '66 Kombi
Scott Johnson, Vanagon Westy
Dave Phillips, Baywindow (not a Westy)
Dave Kautz and kids, '77 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser

So that makes the breakdown:

2 splits, none campers
4 baywindows, 1 safari, 2 westys
4 vanagons, all westys
1 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser

Who'd I miss?
