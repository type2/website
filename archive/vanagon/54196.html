Subject: FS:  '89 Westfalia Camper 

'89 Westfalia pop-top camper, great shape, needs a good home.

One-owner vehicle, well cared for, have all original documents and repair 
records since new. Excellent running condition.  103k mostly-highway miles. 
Interior is virtually perfect. Perfect canvas. Stove, fridge, etc. all work 
fine.  4-speed, power steering/brakes, A/C, power mirrors, factory cruise 
control(works great!), Pioneer/Polk Audio detachable-face CD sound system.
 
Body not perfect, but very good. Slight dent on right rear wheel well lip 
(surface rust on the dent), also a minor dent (w/surface rust) on the 
little metal apron under the rear bumper. A couple of small scratches here 
and there, but nothing major. Generally looks very nice. White. No 
rust-through, not even at the seams where many Vanagons seem to rust. Has 
the typical Vanagon flaws (i.e. high setting on front heater blower doesn't 
work, speedo needle chatters a bit below 50mph, and there's a crack, but no 
apparant leak, in the roof vent), but the important stuff's all good.  Temp 
guage never gets above half way even after extended idling, steering rack 
is good, shifts great, new exhaust, new tires, etc.  The only thing I can 
find that it seems to need mechanically is a front-end alignment (pulls 
just slightly to the right).

This is not my daily driver (unfortunately).  I got a good deal on it, and 
jumped on it, hoping to keep it and sell my '85, but figuring that at the 
very least I could easily resell it. I just returned from a 10-hour trip in 
it.  Believe me when I tell you that I wish I could keep it.  It drives 
much nicer than my '85 - like a newer van, which it is.  But other things 
just aren't working out, and I can't afford to keep it. (I still haven't 
given up on updating from my '85, though. I'm hopefully getting another '89 
for myself; it's in nowhere near as good condition as this one, but 
realistically more in my price range.  Oh well...maybe someday I'll work up 
to the late model Syncro Westy I really want!) 

Anyway, I'm asking $12,500 for it. Judging from some of the Westies 
I've seen posted, and this one's condition, it's probably worth more than 
that, but I can't afford to sit on both this and my '85. I'm in the 
Phila./Allentown Pa. area.  Email me or call (610) 754-8989 if interested.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
