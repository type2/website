So Jrl says:
&gt; We are not VW novices. In fact I had checked the valve clearances and
&gt; changed the oil (which I do at 3000 mile intervals AND within a
&gt; couple of days of a new rebuild). In fact, this particular engine was
&gt; preety good at keeping the valve clearances steady. After the engine
&gt; started smoking on a big hill south of Las Vegas, we stoppped
&gt; immediately, even though the engine was still running. After it
&gt; cooled overnight, I checked the valves, which were all fine, but the
&gt; compression in #3 was zilch, and that's where the oil was leaking from
&gt; as well. The oil was not burning in the engine, but on the outside of
&gt; the hot jugs.   

Well... I could only judge by your previous post that had no indication
of how you took care of your engine.  In that light, I would say that
reading how you drive, I would put in oil temp and head temp gauges 
and use them as a guide as to how fast you should be driving.  This
should help you keep the engine temp down.  Other than that, I don't
know what went wrong with the engine.
