Subject: Cracks in Roof Vent of 88 Westy

Folks,

I have an 1988 Westy with a small (about 14&quot; x14&quot;) plastic vent in the 
center of the pop-top.  The trouble is that it keeps developing cracks along 
the perimeter.  I have had two replaced under warrenty.  The third time (out 
of warrenty) my dealter informed me that the price was $175 (what a 
suprise).  I contacted the original manufacturer in California and they 
couls send me a replacement for $150.  Does anyone know of another source 
for the vents?  How do I prevent the cracks from developing?  I don't drive 
with the vent open.
