GO FIGURE

I noticed on the trip back to Chicago from Ft. Myers at spring break
that I was getting a little smoke off the engine from oil.
Investigating, found it was the tube from the crank case to the air
intake on the top of the engine (about 1 inch diameter and 8 inches
long).  There was a gash wide open about 2 inches long.

Anyhow, I replaced it, and now the engine is more sluggish than ever.
There seems to be enough power at the higher revs, but response is
really poor.  I have read threads re spark plug gaps and vacuum
hoses/connections.  The one odd thing is that my engine has great
response when cold, but at operating temp, it feels like a turbo--- lots
of lag.

Any ideas cherished.
