So Terry Tan says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Sure , if you change the coolant and do not follow the mfr directions, 
&gt; you will surely end up in deep trouble. The cooling system unlike most
&gt; other systems must be bled just like your brake system. 
&gt; This means opening the bleed valve in the radiator in front and make sure
&gt; the coolant is filled 100% or else air pockets will remain resulting in
&gt; poor cooling of the engine and thus overheating. This

Yeah-yeah, I know all that, but... do the air pockets directly relate
to the head pitting or not?   

&gt; dont last like a Mb or Toyota. When you are on a long trip and it goes
&gt; you'll be thankful you had one. You dont pick this up too easily 
&gt; anywhere.

Hmmmmm.... Good advice (I think).  How are the later water pumps?
