&gt; &gt; &gt;Hello all,
&gt; &gt; In mid-September 1996 four St. Francis Xavier University
&gt; &gt; &gt;Students, Steve Dorey, Al Joseph, Brian Starzomski, and Mark Toth, will
&gt; &gt; &gt;be leaving Nova Scotia for a nine month journey to Southern Chile (Tierra
&gt; &gt; &gt;del Fuego).
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I'm almost as jealous as Rusty ;-)


Hmmm...  I actually was hoping we could treat the Inuvik trip as a 
warm-up to just such a journey!  Nuts?!  No way!  Why enslave ourselves 
to this non-existent notion of 'job security'?  Quit!  Sell the house!  
Cash out Tommy's college fund!  We could be laid off/bought out/forclosed 
upon next week, so why not launch a pre-emptive strike?: get in the 
bus and drive, baby, drive!

Other trips I've got in mind:
- The Kinshasa Highway across equitorial Africa
- Across the ex-USSR.  Container to Amsterdam, drive east, load bus into 
container at Vladivostok, come home.
- Circumnavigate Australia
- (possible addition to the USSR trip): south of Siberia to 
Mongolia/China, to Tibet, across the Himilayas to either India or 
Pakistan, and to whereevr from there!  (ship to Somalia to pick up 
Kinshasa Highway?)
- Back to Baja to free camp on a white sand beach and drink beer.
