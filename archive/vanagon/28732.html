&gt;&gt; of us east coasters having enough time to get out there, then
&gt;&gt; blow 3 weeks then get back is for most of us totally impossible,
&gt;&gt; I feel we need an alternative, and less we fail to get on the
&gt;&gt; ball I think we should start planning alternatives now.

An east coast run, new england-quebec-into labrador barrens may satisfy 
those cravings for mud rocks and broken windshields, as well as fulfulling 
the outdoor experience credit.  I think several listers have done some thing 
like this.
