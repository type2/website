If they split the list, where do you put the questions like this, about
camper goodies- on air-cooled list or wasser-- and if it goes to both,
those on both lists will wade thru more stuff?

We use a magnetic backed 2 bulb fluorescent lamp  (bought at K Mart?)  with
a switch to use one or both bulbs.  It has a hook on it also. It is very
versatile, and get all sorts of use, with little use of electricity.  BTW,
Home Depot sells a $7 portable 6v fluorescent which could be used in series
with another one to make one that works on 12 supply of van?  MB
