I have the Bus Stop catalog right in front of me and on page 32 they show
this &quot;GT Sports System&quot; exhaust (picture 1) for $126 that would apparently fit
my 75 1.8l fuel injected bus. Has anyone ever tried one of those? 

I think it's rather ugly with its double pair of tail pipes, kinda takes
the laid back look away, but the alternative is the stock equipment you
can find on the next page, comprising an elbow for $72.95,a connecting
pipe for $21.95, a muffler for $99.50, a tail pipe for $9.50 plus
miscellaneous gaskets, clamps, and straps, so figure more than $200.

The &quot;GT Sports&quot; exhaust promises more power and gas mileage and a &quot;smooth,
mellow exhaust note.&quot; I guess that means it's loud. For those who don't
have the catalog, let me quote another statement: &quot;..., the GT Sports
Exhaust is a true free-flow system designed to reduce back-pressure and
allow your engine to breathe easier, thereby producing more power.&quot; That's
gibbrish to me, anyone care to translate? I mean, if this is such a great
thing, why didn't VW think of it? Also, is this compatible with the fuel
injection? Will engine reliability (what reliability?) be further
diminished? 

Oh, and something else: what are those extractors I see on the same page? --

Thanks in advance.
