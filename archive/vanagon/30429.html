Subject: RE:any eurovans out there?

Rick (RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu) says &quot;it handles well&quot; ????

OK, we love our '93 MV, at c. 25,000 nothing major has failed although a
fair number of interior bits have fallen off (and been easily re-attached),
but it's really not a  GTI Rick...........the &quot;design bogie&quot; was the Ford
Transit.....

Rick's right, the OEM tires aren't great. Ours will probably last another
5K-7K, but traction (wet or dry) is not great.

Rick under states the EV heating/cooling system: separate
blowers/exchangers/controls fore and aft, drive you out of the bus heat in
short order.....Surely Duane Moore up there in Alberta has &quot;EV heater lust&quot;
:)
