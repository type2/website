Subject: Re: The $900. '92 VW Bus (lucky/tall tale?)

My other example is the stand alone/drive away Westy tent that my buddy
bought (I eventually got) last month from the recycler trader newspaper for
$30.00 (was asking $50. for &quot;vw tint&quot;) I suppose everyone though about
window tinting and ignored the ad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHA
This one I know is gospel cuz it's in my garage. (I paid a *bit* more than
$30 for it). Looks like it was used once. Came in big red and white striped
heavy canvas baseball team equipment style bag.

Other Gospel story is that some unscrupulous local guys paid a visit to a
local long time VW collector that had a stroke or accident or something and
wasn't the same tough, old wise dog that he had been. The collector's wife
usually watched out for his best interests but was away doing errands during
the visit. The scoundrels snapped up split oval Telefunken radios,
semaphores and heart tail lights, rare toys, literature and (Parts of this
caliber) etc. for much less than pennies on the dollar of the actual worth.
The wife asked what the small change was on the table and was understandably
pissed off when she was told the old gang had been by for a visit. Some
major buttheads out there have stories to tell of the &quot;deal&quot; that they got.
Once again, Rusty votes for protection of kids, old folks, and those who
can't fend for themselves.
