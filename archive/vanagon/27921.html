Subject: Re: oil light

&gt;&gt;No they really shouldn't do this.. bad vanagon bad. The oil pressure sender
&gt;&gt;is really quite amazing on the Vanagon. It consist of two pressure switches
&gt;&gt;that must respond in the correct sequence during startup within a specified
&gt;&gt;time frame. Whew! Failing either of these parameters causes the bell and
&gt;&gt;light show.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Althought many things can go wrong one of the most common and easiest to fix
&gt;&gt;is corrosion/loose connectors/moisure. Get some contact cleaner from say,
&gt;&gt;Radio Shark. Clean the switch's male connection and the connectors female
&gt;&gt;socket. Before reassembling apply a generous coating of silicon dielectric
&gt;&gt;paste, this will seal the moisure and oxygen out. Viola, no more corrosion.
&gt;&gt;Now Mr Vanagon can hear what the sensors are saying and all will be well.
&gt;
&gt;Not quite.  The Dynamic Oil Pressure sending system is only on '86 and later
&gt;model year Vanagons--those of us with '85s only have only one sender, no DOP
&gt;circuit board with the buzzer mounted around the inside of the speedometer.
&gt;
&gt;My oil pressure light comes on at low idle.  Now that I have the CO set
&gt;properly, and the idle at right around 900 stabilized, the oil pressure
&gt;light no longer comes on.
&gt;
&gt;Apparently, the Dynamic system does solve low idle oil light flickers--my
&gt;old Rabbits used to have flickering oil light problems as well--my '85 Jetta
&gt;with the Dynamic system didn't have a problem with it.  The circuit board
&gt;with the buzzer did fail once, however, giving me buzzing noises with normal
&gt;oil pressure above 2500 RPM.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway--I will only worry about my oil pressure light if it comes on at some
&gt;speed above idle.

Thanks, Donald,very good! Starting to wonder if I was nuts. Most old
VeeDubs with some miles on them had this quirk,which I never considered a
problem. Went out to the garage and found the Bently book,revealing no
unusual oil pressure light circuitry. I'm sure it's a connection problem,
due to the increased circumstances when the weather is moist.

Goodnight,typ II freaks:
