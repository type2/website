&gt; &gt; 1. they had to live with the car they chose for five years.
&gt; &gt; 2. it was to be their only automobile in those five years.
&gt; &gt; 3. they had to drive it daily to work, to the 7-11, across the country, and
&gt; &gt;       through michigan winters.
&gt; &gt; 4. after five years, they would give the car back, without depreciation
&gt; &gt;       affecting him in any way.
&gt; &gt; 5. they would, however, have to foot the bill for maintenance, fuel, tires;
&gt; &gt;       all non-warranty upkeep would be dollars dragged from their personal
&gt; &gt;       savings.

&gt; &gt;	I hate to admit it but I would get one of those Humvee (sp),
&gt; &gt;	jeep on steroids thing. Rig some sort of camper add-on, or
&gt; &gt;	maybe a pop-top, yeh thats it a hummer with a pop top!
&gt; &gt;	The attraction is a car that can go more places, tow things, and
&gt; &gt;	looks better when scratched.

	If I didn't have to work and could cruise freely:

		1996 EuroBago Camper V6
			Furnace
			(4) Motorola Digital Cells
				(2) w/ handsfree for voice
				(2) for data
			Recaros up front
			Alpine in-dash CD changer w/ remote along with
				beaucoup Sounstream amps and Cambridge
				Soundworks speakers
			

	If the only change in my life was the free car:

		1995 Audi Convertible
			Leather
			Pearl White
			(3) Motorola Digital Cells
				(2) w/ handsfree for voice
				(1) for data
			Alpine in-dash CD changer w/ remote along with
				beaucoup Sounstream amps and unknown  
				speakers
