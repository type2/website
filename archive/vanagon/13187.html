 There have been several posts recently citing 185/75-R14 as the &quot;standard&quot;
 size tire for Vanagons. I don't think this is true. I believe, and please
 correct me if I am wrong, that the standard size is 185-R14C &lt;for Reinforced&gt;
 If my knowledge of tire lore is correct, profiles &lt;the &quot;/75&quot;&gt; are spelled
 out when they deviate from the standard, which is 80% height vs. cross-
 section. 
 Unfortunatly for the Vanagon/Bus owner, the 185-R14C tires are a lot less
 common and always more expensive than the many P185/75-R14 tires available.
 The last ones I found were Michelins and were $91.00 each!

 Here are some quick calculations for overall diameter:

      Tire Size               Overall Diameter

      185-R14C                25.6 inches &lt;mine measure 25.5, but they're worn&gt;

      185/75-R14              24.9 inches 
     
      195/75-R14              25.5 inches
      
      205/70-R14              25.3 inches


 I included the 205/70-R14 size becuse I have seen them fitted on the alloy
 wheels that some Vanagons have. From this chart, I'd say that LT195/75-R14
 tires mentioned with enthusiasm by some posters are a better choice for
 maintaining accurate speedometer readings and the stock revs/mile relationship
 than moving to 185/75-R14 tires.


 Rotationally yours,

 Dave
