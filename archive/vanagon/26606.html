&gt;since it was a B-29 named &quot;Bock's Car&quot; that dropped the 2nd atom
&gt;bomb on Japan in WWII.

Major Bock was the pilot of the Nagasaki plane. He, and the plane,
also flew weather-observation on the first (Hiroshima) bomb mission.

At least he had the cojones to follow through on a mission that was
horrible, but necessary.
