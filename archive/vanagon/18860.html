Subject: 74 valve clearance?
Date: Thu, 8 Jun 1995 14:51:07 -0400 (EDT)


	hello volks,

		i have been adjusting my own valves since i bought
		my bus in november and have not had any problems
		but recently i have been rereading Muir and noticed
		something.  At the beginning of the maintainance
		section he specifically states that if you have
		a sticker on your &quot;engine&quot; go by that, do not
		necessarily follow the owner's manual.  

		Yet, later in the section where you actually do
		the valves he says for 65 and older use the sticker
		on the engine if you have it, and for newer models
		set them all to .006, even if the sticker says .004
		because you would rather have them loose than burn
		a valve seat.

		the problem is that my sticker on my engine says
		.008 for exhaust and .006 for intake or vice versa
		should i just set them all at .006 or follow the 
		sticker, BTW my engine was indeed rebuilt once, it
		is the original though.

		thanks for any insight,

				kevin 74 camper

					peace
