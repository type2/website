&gt;Hmmm, I've called Whip-Me twice and requested the VW-only catalog and twice
&gt;have received the 'Everything Auto' catalog with 5 pages of VW stuff.  Quit
&gt;ordering all the extra VW ones so they can send me one!!!

I have called jc whitney 3 times asking for the VW only catalog, they keep
sending me the &quot;everything&quot; one, i even got into a lengthy discussion with
an operator over VW's, and she still sent me the &quot;everything&quot; one so i quit
calling.

they have human telephone operators, but hire chimpanzees to fill the
catalog orders, thats just what i have heard, jane goodall (the ape lady)
was put in charge of personel...
