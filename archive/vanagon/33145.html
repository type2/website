Steve Said:
&gt;The bus ran great but I have a slight problem with the
&gt;heat system. I don't have any kind of aux. heater so I'm stuck with the
&gt;heat exchanger stuff. It sort of works but I'm getting this obnoxious odor
&gt;through the tubes. It smells like a combination of dirty, greasy engine and
&gt;gasoline, mixed with a faint whisp of exhaust. Is this normal? (BTW the bus
&gt;is so full of holes I'm not to worried about asphyxiation, (Sometimes I
&gt;even get snow drifts INSIDE the bus)

I was driving my drafty old '69 in Pennsylvania one winter day and stopped
to get Wendy's french fries (the fat, ---steaming---, fluffy kind - BTW, I
have no personal affiliation with Wendy's). This was my get-warm ritual.
Well, this particular day was about 20 degrees and 100% relative humidity.
As I sat in my beast eating the french fries, the steam rose to the
ceiling, cooled on its way down, and, I sh*t you not, fell as snow into the
speedo cup to a depth of about a millimeter!

There! can anyone else claim actual meteorlogic activity inside their bus?
I think (also hope) not.
