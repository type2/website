Joel.
	I have a friend who has one of those vans with the top that lifts 
straight up.  He is in S. America so I can't ask him what the make is.
However, I do remember that it is a Southern CA thing. The van is a 78' 
and was very well done and quite livable.
	Two things I noticed about it;
	1)  More versitile lighting than the Westies.     
	2)  Comfortable interior with ergonomic furniture, cabinets, and 
counters.  Though, it was not too unlike the mobile homes of the 70's and 
80's which I was unfortunet enough to endure a few years, it was more 
tasteful.
	I kinda think the name had &quot;country&quot; in it.  Maby it was country 
homes?  I think it would be worth looking at.
