Well, here's a data point. Someone in the local vintage VW
club (of SE Mich) put an ad in the newsletter saying he would
pay $250-300 for a clean copy of a very early edition Muir.  This
was a year ago or so.

According to the text in the 25th anniv. ed., the first run
was only 2500 or 5000 copies, and plenty of them have been
consumed in engine fires by now  :-(
