&gt; 
&gt; What consition is your current paint in?
&gt; 
&gt; If its OK, then you can get away with wet sanding with 320 and then 400, and
&gt; if you're really anal, 600.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have rust, scratches, lifting, crazing, checking, etc, then its a 
&gt; whole different story...
yep that's what i got.  The paint is cracked, there is surface rust, 
is peeling in spots, you name it its got it.  this is not the original 
paint.  So what's the different story?
