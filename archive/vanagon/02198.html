Subject: Re: Late nighter's and early risers (trip talk)


&gt; 
&gt; Another thing we need to consider about this trip is that
&gt; some of us will want to party till late and not want to get 
&gt; up till 12:00 noon.  Others will retire earlier and want to
&gt; get an early start.  It's a fact of life.  I think it would
&gt; be wise if we discussed the logistics of solving this dilemma.
&gt; 
 
This is certainly something worth finding out as it can have a big
impact on such a trip.  I will usually want to get up early and do
some photography around sunrise and will want to camp far enough away
from the late night party people to get some shut-eye fairly early.
Periodically, however, every third or forth night, say, I would want
to hang out with the late night party people to swap VW stories, re-tell
absurd Monty Python anecdotes, and drink beer around the campfire.  So,
six of one, half dozen of the other...

If we do group camping, perhaps we could have a quiet section and a
late-night section...  When we are in motels it wouldn't matter.  
Just have two groups that leave at different times.  We would see
each other once in a while I'm sure :-)

Certainly, for certain special events, like a tour of Carlsbad Caverns,
everyone who wanted to go could plan their camping/partying/whatever
around that event.
