 My dealer doesn't have the boot in stock.  Neither does Toronto, so 
 it's coming from California, and should be here by Dec 20..  It costs
 $47.00 CDN.  They hope to undo 
 the tie-rod from the rack, and preserve the wheel alighnment.  They 
 figure 1.5 hours work.  If they have to undo the tie-rod at the ball 
 joint, that will be 3.5-4.5 hours including a wheel alignment!  So, 
 let's hope the shorter time prevails!!   &gt;&gt;


The boot is available aftermarket through Beck Arnley.  The boot will also
fit over ther outer tie rod end.  Removing the outer end from the steering
knuckle and slipping the boot over it is the easiest way to go.  Should take
less than an hour and a wheel alignment will not be neccasary.  The boot
being twisted up was probably caused by the ignaramus that performed the last
wheel alignment.  The never bother to hold the boots while turning the tie
rods to make the adjustments.
