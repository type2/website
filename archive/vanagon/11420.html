So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; perhaps the germans use more 'real' rubber, whereas the american use synthetic
&gt; rubber (which will still be here, in landfills and junkyards, for a thousand
&gt; years), cause 'real' rubber won't hold up to outdoor sun and heat very well.


Umm Joel, when did the synthetic hoses come into being?
