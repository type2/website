Mark,

The Edmunds home page on the WWW at:

gopher://gopher.enews_dot_com:70/11/magazines/alphabetic/all/edmunds

It lists prices for used vehicles from 1985.

I checked out the list price for my Westy that I had bought in 
April. I paid $4100, the retail price was $5700. 

Good luck,
John Sharpe
'86 Westy/Wolfsburg/Weekender
