(My brother just sent me this EMail after we purchased an '86 Vanagon GL 3000
miles away.)


Janet,

Just read about the German conspiracy.  Scientists have been conducting a 
study of Vanagon owners to determine why they are all so helplessly in love 
with these overrated, underpowerd, noisy, aesthetically ugly, troublesome 
vehicles.

Well, yesterday they found the answer!

Apparently, the Germans have a subliminal message buried in the name 
&quot;Vanagon&quot;: whereby every time a person says the word, their mind hears the 
words &quot;Van Again&quot;.  If you say &quot;Vanagon&quot; enough times (they believe it takes 
more than 50 repetitions), then you begin feeling dependent on the vehicle
and 
very defensive about its value to the human race.  

In extreme cases, people have been known to lose sleep when their vehicle (I 
must avoid the trap of using the other &quot;V&quot; word too much!) finally needs 
replacement and they embark on all sorts of extreme measures to locate, and 
purchase for obscene amounts of money, similar, if not identical, replacement

vehicles.  

Based on what I've observed, you certainly have fallen prey to this 
conspiracy.

(At least he didn't say anything about head gaskets!   :-} .......)
