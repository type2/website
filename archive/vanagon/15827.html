Listizens,

I must sadly report the demise of a later model vanagon.

Easter Sunday morning, driving along route 30 in PA, I came 
upon the scene of a Vanagon, upside down along the side
of the road, surrounded by ambulances and fire trucks.

That section of road is kinda bumpy, and the wind was really 
howling, like 50 MPH. (70 KPH) No other vehicle was present,
so I assumed that the Vanagon had some toruble with wind
shear, or mabye a tire blew, or something. She was on the
wrong side of the road, completely belly-up.

The good news was that the ambulances and fire trucks were just sitting
there, so I assume that no one was seriously hurt, and the vanagon
might be salvageable.

Just a note. (Nobody from the list, was it?)
