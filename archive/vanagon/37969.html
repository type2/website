Subject: '84 1.9L Engine??

  This is an update on my progress with getting a new engine for my van. I've
decided to buy one from the Volks Cafe that is in a crashed van.  I've been
talking to Kyle and we've agreed on a price. He's going to ship me the engine
and a bunch of the other attached stuff.  This works out better for me than
buying a longblock. It means that I won't have to spend too much time doing
the swap, and since we only have one vehicle, it's important that I don't
take it off the road for too long.
  Then, while the old engine is out of the car I can do work on it gradually
and find out how salvageable it is. The engine I'm buying has 98K on it (which
beats my 169K all to heck) so I expect in 4 years or so, I'll need to do
something major to it too.  The compression figures were excellent, and the
head gaskets were worked on and new rings put in at the same time about 1000
miles ago.

Wish me luck.
