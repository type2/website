Subject: Bra offer closed.  thanks.

I'm glad someone could use the bra.  it seems there's a good market 
for free bras out there...  since none of the takers is going to 
Inuvik i'll be arbitrarily selecting a winner, based on shallow 
impressions and good looks-- just like the banks do for loans.  I'll 
contact the people privately and randomly choose (throw all the printed 
email messages in the air and whichever one lands on my desk in the 
shape of a swan wins) the recipeint of my bra in Good Condition.
