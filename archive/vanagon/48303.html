This description is pretty accurate - the main seal in my Jetta has 
leaked for about a year, and the grabbing has gradually worsened. On 
the heavier vanagon, it may fail much sooner however. Leaking rear 
main seals are very common on the VW inline 4s, but I'm not sure 
about the w/b - so far mine is ok.
