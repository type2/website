This message was sent to me via my website.  I think there are better
experts on the list than me on the value of Canadian Westies and the
relative merits of the Eurovan.  PLEASE RESPOND DIRECTLY TO SENDER, NOT TO
ME.
Thanks,

&gt; I have a 1991 Canadian Westfalia, 106,000 km. Great Condition. No Air. 
&gt; CD. What is it worth in American Dollars? How do you feel about the 1997 
&gt; EV's? I am thinkin of trading up or is that trading down. thanks. Lee
