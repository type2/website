&gt; The mpeg looks good on my pc; well ok, it's in greyscale, but other

Nah, she basically ordered us to do it and then kept on driving when she
got free.  Well, not really.  =)

Glad to see it worked, and I don't know why it is in greyscale.  I think
I may be using the wrong cable to hook it up, but I'm not sure.
