Greetings Folks,
I've got a bunch of info on Eberspacher B2, BN 2, BN 4, and BA 6 heaters.
If anybody needs help getting their heater tuned for the winter, I'd be 
glad to help.  I also have an assortment of used parts and complete units for 
sale, both for Eberspacher and Stewart Warner.

Stay warm,

Tom Johnson
