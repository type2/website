Subject: Re: Owner's manuals, kind of

well if it is those brackets you are referring to, i think we all would
know that they are for a canvas cot which attaches to those little metal
brackets!

&gt;&gt; I have a 1973 Campmobile.  Did they have a special supplement for the
&gt;&gt; camping equipment?  There are little brackets that I can't figure out what
&gt;&gt; to do with!!!
&gt;Which little brackets are you speaking of? On the front windshield
&gt;posts, perhaps?
