Subject:      HELP!: ENGINE info needed...


I don't have time to get to why just yet but I need to look at engine
alternatives for an 85 westy. I have a mechanic who says there is knocking
(not to my knowledge though). I need to look at worst case scenario which is
probably crankshaft problems. Anyway, VW remanufactured shortblock is $2450,
Parts place sells a long block (reman) for just under that amount. My mech
says that GEX has a whole engine for $2450. Anyone have other sources? Anyone
have negative things (or positive) to say about any of the above mfrs (private
email is fine).

I just spent $2000 on it in the last month so I need some price consideration.
I'm no mechanic but for the money they want to charge for installation of a
short block, I'm wondering if I can handle a long block install. Anyone in my
area up for getting dirty? As far as warranties, my garage gives 6 months
parts and labor which is shit compared to the hellish labor charges. VW, and
Parts place gives 12 month/24000 mi warranty on their remans. Not sure about
GEX. Parts place will also send USED for about 1400 or 1500 and gives 3 months
on those. Given head problems in vanagons, I'm not inclined to go that route.
Also, since there are core charges, I'm wondering what I could keep from my
own engine. I mean, what exactly is included in a &quot;core&quot;? My heads were
replaced 3 years ago and the cost of those alone might be worthy of keeping my
engine. Any ideas folks? I haven't had my van in a month and I'm eager to get
rolling.
