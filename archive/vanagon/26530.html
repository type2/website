Subject: RE: A NAME FOR VANAGON FANATICS!



&gt;THATS IT!  If Ford enthusiasts are Fordnatics, that must mean that we're
&gt;VANATICS!
&gt;It has a certain ring to it doesn't it?


Yes it does!

But one little glitch...

VW is the only company that makes Vanagons, of course.
But it isn't the only one that makes vans. The name might apply
to Chevy vans, Ford vans...  Hmmmm...

Vanagonatics?  Kinda long.
Vanagatics?   Nope.
Busnatics?   A stretch.
Vanageeks?   No thanks.
StreamlinedAsABrick?   REAL long.

All IMHO, of course.

How about it, sports fans? Get your entry in now before the deadline!
Win valuable prizes, not sold in stores, limited time only...

BTW, even if we get something we like, who says the name of the list
has to change? Maybe the list administrator should have 51% of the vote?
Subject to appropriate pressure, threats, and bribes from interested
parties, of course.

P.S. I've always liked steVANagon_at_lenti etc. myself... (ducking thrown 
tomatoes)
