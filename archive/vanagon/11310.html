&gt;Tell me this is so Joel &quot;Data Bank&quot; Walker.  My syncro was produced in
&gt;November 1986, and I wasn't aware of the recall  Do you have any other
&gt;information concerning the recall?????  What does campaign PB mean???  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

Mike, I've tried to send you a file with the campaign details.

I use PC-Eudora ver.1.4 and the file was 'attached' If nothing/trash comes 
through let me know. Joel W. will probably drop the lot in your letter box 
anyhow!  tim s.
