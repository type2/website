Subject: 87- Stop the fresh air!


Hello again-

Is it normal to always have fresh air flowing into the cabin in my 1987 
Vanagon?  I've read the owner's manual and tried everything from the control 
panel on the dash to stop/reduce the fresh air flow into the cabin.  I can 
heat it, direct it to the windshield, dash vents, or foot vents, but I can't 
stop it!  Any ideas?  It's going to be cold soon in Colorado...

Thanks-
