Ron:
sounds like a lot of work.There is a marked difference in power between
my 86 2.1L Transporter and my wifes' 85 GL (but not enough to justify
all the work). I credited that to mine being from Canada(see 2 below).I
would like to explore easier ,more conventional ways to gain HP.
How about:
1&gt;replacing air box with less restrictive K&amp;N filter? I have seen this
mod for sale for Porsches with very similar air boxes.
2&gt;Computer mod. any one remember the old 411(?) VW station wagon.the
first mass produced FI car?You could cut a certain wire going to the
computer and in effect put it in a higher out &quot;European&quot; program
mode.the power was reduced for US markets to meet emission standards I
believe.
3&gt;Increase throttle body diameter by swapping out with one from another
vehicle .this one sounds pretty radical, i admit.But again,they sell
after market TBs for other cars.

I have been mulling #1 over for some time.My main concern is :Will a K&amp;N
provide comparable air filtration to a stock unit?has anyone seen any
specs?
