Over a period of several years, I have rebuilt many automotive brake 
cylinders, saving many customers the difference between the $3-$10 cyl 
rebuild kit and the $75-$150 rebuilt cylinder.  To the best of my knowledge, 
none of the rebuilds went away, and continued to provide service for a 
period about as long as the original equipment.  The key is carefully 
cleaning the cylinder, and honing it just enough to clean up the bore....and 
realize that if there is heavy pitting in the bore, it is too late for a 
rebuild.  Use the correct assembly lube, and fully bleed the system, not 
only to get the air out, but also to get fresh fluid in.

So:  why do cylinders fail, seems to be a good follow up question.  Brake 
fluid readily absorbs water from the atmosphere, and that water serves to 
corrode (rust) the cast iron surfaces of the cylinders, eventually pitting 
the surfaces so much that the rubber seal can't, and a leak develops.  
Regularly flushing the system (every 2 years has worked very well for me and 
the fleet I used to service...) removes all that old, wet fluid, and prevent 
the corrosion at the heart of the problem.

Before I started a regular program of flushing, I would perform an average 
of 8-10 cylinder rebuilds per year on a fleet of 25 vehicles, average age 16 
years old.  After starting a regular flush program, that figure fell to zero 
(!) and stayed there for 3 or so years.  In addition to the cylinder service 
thing, pedal effort on the brakes would fall, making the brakes 
feel...almost sensous in theri response.  Very nice.

Flushing can be a pain, no doubt.....I always use a &quot;gravity bleed&quot;, using 
the weight of the column of glycol to force the fluid through the system.  
No partner required.  Keep the master cyl topped off, open the bleeder 
screws jointly or severally, and let 'em drip untiil the fluid is clear.

My '85 is dripping brake fluid from the clutch slave cylinder. I
thought I might just try replacing the seals. I tried doing this
several years ago on an old Datsun's brake slave cylinder but it leaked
soon afterward. Anyone have luck with the cheap approach or should I do
it right and just buy a new one.
