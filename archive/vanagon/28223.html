&gt; I try my best not to deal with those companies which think that

She's not just &quot;on or near it&quot; she's part of the product.  You should have
seen the BABE I got included with my order from GEX.  Didn't you guys know
this?

All kidding aside, this kind of advertising went out of fashion in the 70's
except for VW parts, monster trucks, and motorcycle magazines.  I think the
sleezy business owners just don't want to give up all those hundreds of model
&quot;interviews&quot; required to find &quot;just the right girl&quot; to sit on/beside/in under
their product.
