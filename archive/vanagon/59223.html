&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if people are aware of it, but Chrysler pulled of of last
&gt;&gt; night's &quot;Ellen Coming Out&quot; episode.  They deemed the episode 'too
&gt;&gt; controversial'.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Their ad slot was purchased by ... VOLKSWAGEN!  Yay VW!  (And a way-cool ad
&gt;&gt; at that!)
&gt;
&gt;  Hey Ron,
&gt;
&gt;I was gonna post that...you beat me to it.  Oh yeah, Wendy's Hamburgers
&gt;suck too.
&gt;

     In partial defense of Wendy's, their decision wasn't to pull out, 
but not to advertise.  Their policy is aparently not to advertise during 
*anything* contriversial.

&gt;From Columbus, OH.  Home of Wendy's (not affiliated, blah, blah, blah).  
Also a very diverse city.
