Subject: thermal value of bra's

     
     
     I was wondering if bra's add any worm to buses.  I considered that 
     cold air, wind, rain/snow against the metal would be colder than the 
     same on a vinal/plastic 'shield'.
     
     I found a wolf brand with a fleece backing for 50 dollars (cheaper 
     than other places I've called)
     
     any experience ?
     
     tring to stay warm in the rockies...
