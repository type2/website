Subject: Wiring ?

I just got my Van back from the paint shop, but with a strange light problem.
The turn indicators blink at a high rate (all the the corners work) and when
the headlights are turned on the amber lights in the back instead of the red,
also the rear side marker lights dont light. I checked all the connections
and they appear to be connected right. I will check with the shop today to
see if there was any other part of the circuit touched but I am sure that I
will get the usual  &quot; we didn't touch anything else&quot;.
Any ideas would be appreciated.
