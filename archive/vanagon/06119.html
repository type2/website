&gt; 
&gt; On another note, a friend of mine, who has no access to the net, called me
&gt; with a request for help today, maybe some of you folks out there can help him:
&gt; 
&gt; This guy owns a '74 Westfailure (sorry for the Freudian slip of the fingers)
&gt; and has decided to get a new engine in to it.  He has also agreed on
&gt; a labor-only basis (fixed price) with a local mechanic to replace the
&gt; engine.  He is apparently happy with their work.  He has so far bought the
&gt; new engine, and they have put it in for him.  He still cannot drive
&gt; the '74, since. apparently, the pipe that extends between the heat exchangers
&gt; and the exhaust(?) (the 3-4 inch pipe, the one that the optional heater
&gt; gets plugged into), is cracked due to old age.  He says he has looked for it,
&gt; but nobody carries it.
&gt; Does anybody know what he is talking about?  If not, what questions should I
&gt; ask him to clarify?
&gt; 
&gt; Any and all help appreciated...
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Cetin

 The only things connected to the heat exchangers on my '74 are A) the muffler,  and B) the plastic bellows to the heater system. Okay, okay, the cables are 
 there too. If it's the plumbing that carries heat up to the passenger 
 compartment, that shouldn't prevent your friend from using his bus.

 I'm thinking he might have a later engine with all those U-pipes and 
 the collector ('75 - '78) but those parts should be available. Even J. C.
 Whitney carries some of them.

 More info. may help sort this out.
