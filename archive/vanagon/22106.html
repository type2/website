Subject: Re: yard list

&gt;Dubsters,
&gt;
&gt; I recently got a list of yards and parts available from someone on the
&gt;list, which I promptly saved to read later, only to find that I don't have
&gt;the senders address and I would like to follow-up.
&gt;
Oh, sure, I lug all these VW catalogs/miscellanea back and forth to work
every day and the one day I clean out my backpack everyone wants the
junkyard info!
I'll repost the list with all the addresses on monday.  

: ) Ron  (vowing never to clean again)
