Subject: Pancake engine questions.

Netizens,

I want to install an oil pressure gauge and an oil temp gauge on
my new '72 pancake engine in the fastback. It still has to fit
under the decklid. The engine has D-Jet FI.

Where do I install these sensors? The pressure gauge doesn't have any
clearance, and I dont want to install the temp gauge in the 
same location? 

Has anybody calibrated a crankcase or head temp sensor to
degrees F or degrees C? What are the resistance vs. temp graphs?

I gotta get an extra one of each and plot them out, then use
a cheap $4.00 voltage gauge and a marking pencil instead of
a $22 temp gauge. Plus, it would let me use the existing
temp sensors, and not jurry rig in some extra hardware.

Just a thought.
