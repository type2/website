 Sorry to take so long to respond, but since one of my kids dropped the laptop
 and broke the screen, I've been getting the digests instead.

 At least two of my three kids are currently scheduled to come to Pfeiffer. 
 With any amount of bad luck, all three will be there. Martha knows who they
 are, they were at the pizza dinner. My nephew has gone back to Oregon. Too
 bad about the weather predictions - stuck in a Westy with three wet kids
 sounds like an &quot;adventure&quot; all right.

 By the way, Gerry, will you please un-digest me - I hate it - I'm missing
 all the fun. Who cares about my job?
