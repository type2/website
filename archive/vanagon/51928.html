Subject: Re: Is there a URL for search identifying any vehicle by it's
  VIN

If it is a 17 digit VIN it will contain alot of information about the
vehicle but without the correct values from the manufacturer you cannot
determine just what the numbers and letters mean. The first digit is
universal 1=USA J=Japan W=Germany. There are more but I don't know what they
are. Other digits refer to seatbelt types, body style, and engine.

&gt;Hey everyone,
&gt;
&gt;Friend just bought a car and wonders if there's an internet way to identify
&gt;specifics by its VIN.  It's not a VW so I won't waste any time asking you
&gt;about it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Mark
