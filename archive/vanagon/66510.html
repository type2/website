I am selling a center seat from a '85 Westy GL.  It has beige/brown velour
upholstery and is in great condition.  The seat reclines, swivels, and has
an integral seat belt and lockable storage bin underneath.  It slides into
the floor rails and allows full access to the refrigerator.  Price is
$250.00 plus shipping.  Contact Cary at chiang1_at_usa_dot_net or call
