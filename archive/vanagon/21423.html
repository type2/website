Subject: Re: Should I buy this 66 Deluxe / Old Volks Home

I agree whole-heartedly with the idea of giving old, thrashed VW's a good 
home.  All my Volksies (execpt the Vanagon) have been rescued from former 
lives as cattle scratchers, buggy donors, storage buildings, etc.  I'm 
coming to the realization that I don't have the time/money to restore any of 
these beauties so I will probably pass them along soon.  I finally talked 
Dad into passing his '54 Beetle on to someone who could afford to bring 
it back to life (we found it in the woods with its nose in the dirt 
[another beam donated to a buggy] gave $100 for it, looked at it for 2 
years and sold it for $250).  I recently rented a covered storage space 
so that I will have a place to land future finds.  If I can find 'em, 
drag 'em in, find 'em a good home (and not *lose* money doing it) then I 
will be a happy man.  Whatever you do, don't wait too long to decide if 
you should buy the old Bus or not.  The call of the &quot;Crusher&quot; is a siren 
song to many ...

&gt; Give the poor thing a home.  If nothing else, throw a couple of tarps over
&gt; it.  If you can't afford it I'm sure some of us will chip in; you can count
&gt; on me for a twenty, pass the buck to whoever takes it on.
