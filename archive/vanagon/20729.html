That may be the case in the UK, but for the US Market the 68 &amp; 69 Beams and
mounting holes are the same.  This did not go to the wider mounting pattern
until the 70 model year and they still had drums for all 3 years.

US Market Buses didn't get the Disc Brakes until 1971 and if you look at the
parts fiche, it would appear that they may have been optionally ordered (in
the US) for the 70 model year, although I don't know of anyone who took
advantage of it.
