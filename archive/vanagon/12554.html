Subject: Re: '87 Vanagon Radio ?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;  I've got a problem with the security divice on my electronic radio cassette
&gt;&gt; in my '87 Vanagon.  It's the factory item.  The radio somehow came loose
&gt;&gt; in the dash mounting and the alarm went off....

Try replacing it with a new one.  I have three VW's now and two have been
retrofitted with VW's 'Heidleberg' radio. I pick these radios up at the
wreckers for about CA$150 and plug and play them into the dash.  It should
just plug in but if it doesn't it's not much of a problem. I replaced the
harness in my old GTI and 85 Westy with the VW plugs which I scavanged from
other wrecked A2 VW's. I find the Heidlebergs to be nice radios and all
have lasted well, easy to use.  Just an idea that's worked very well for
me, Bruce
