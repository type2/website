Subject: back on line, new radiator


Hello All,

I'm back on line. I had unsubscibed while I was on vacation 
in West Virginia. If you recall, I had a problem with my '86
Westy over heating. Just before my vacation I had the radiator
replaced, a very worth while investment. The old one had 129,000
miles on it. When I had it flushed a few weeks a go, the mechanic
took note that the flow rate wasn't what it should have been.
Now the water temp needle sits on top of the LED, only on some 
of the steeper mountains would the needle move pass the LED. The 
new radiator installed cost $430, I'm very happy with the results 
and would recommend a radiator replacement to anybody with a 
wasserboxer that overheats.
