Subject: Sundial Campers

  Someone asked about Sundial camper conversions the other day.
Last night I had a Brain Fart(tm) and remembered that an old
friend named Trish had a Sundial.  It was based on a green and
white '64 bus.

  It was a walk-thru with the same layout as the Westfalia of
that era.  Jump seat behind driver, ice box/sink behind the
passenger seat.  It also had the fold-down dinner table and a
bench seat/bed combo w/ louvered glass windows along the sides.
This camper layout is similar to my '73 except for the pop-top.
I don't remember if Trish's bus had a pop-top or not. &lt;shrug&gt;

  The Sundial conversion looked like a copycat of the Westfalia
design, and was manufactured in southern California (I think).
