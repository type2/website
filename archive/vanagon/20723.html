Subject: vehicle names

I've been trying to think of names for the pair now.  In the past the 
Campmobile has always just been &quot;the bus&quot; to the family (and the station 
wagon, &quot;the wagon&quot; - original, huh?).

I've been giving some thought to Stanley ('68 crew cab pickup) and Stella 
('73 Campmobile) from an animation video I saw years ago.

Like these?  Any ideas?
