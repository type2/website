Subject: Help: cost/feasability of new AC, 86 Vanagon

We have found a '86 Vanagon GL that we would like to purchase.  It has
everything we want, but it does not have AC.  Does anyone know  the  cost
(ballpark figure) of installing  a new AC system?  Do they still make AC
units to fit this model?  Also would it even be possible to install one if it
has a sunroof?  We thought someone might be able to help, as the dealerships
are closed today and we have no way of obtaining this information over the
weekend.  We do need to make a decision on this vehicle.  ANY input would be
helpful.  The van is in mint condition and if there is any way to make it
work for us without costing a small  fortune we would like to buy it.
