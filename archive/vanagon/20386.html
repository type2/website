Grand Opening, Today -- Fried-Day

Due to recent advances in technology, the real-time, honest to Abe 
gargage has changed character.  Greasy mechanics with lurid pictures 
on their Snap-On toolboxes have been replaced with greasy computer 
geeks with lurid pictures (of vans) on their monitors.  

Welcome and meet our staff:

Owner/Proprietor:  Gerry Skerbitz.  Gerry didn't really intend to 
expand his operation to the current level it has grown but being an
easy going sort,  went with the flow. He says it gets him 'money for 
nothing and chicks for free'

Service Manager:  Joel Walker.  You've always wanted a service 
manager like Joel, now you got him.  Need a part number for that set 
of points out of a '59 Split?  No problem.  Looking for that obscure 
service owner's manual.  Joel's got it in stock and if he don't, 
he'll order it for you!  Howz THAT for service?

Sales:  Martha Rubin/Steve Johnson.  Women can sell cars.  Boy, can 
they sell cars.  Wrapped in the latest flannel, no buyer can resist 
the charms of a saleswoman that knows her Blummenvasen from her 
silver socket.  Steve?  Well Steve just pummels the customer with 
verbage until they are so dazed, they'll buy anything.

Customer Relations:  Ric.  Who else?  :)

Line Mechanics:  the good people of this list.  They work for 
peanuts(butter), never tire (groan), and actually enjoy getting 'gas in 
the face'.  There's an expert at every terminal and clean finger 
nails on every keyboard :)   The nice thing about THESE mechanics 
working on your van is that the darn things just seem to fix 
themselves.  Heads are mysteriously relaced, CV joints greased, and 
even that little bolt dropped into the engine case is retrieved.

I'm sure I've missed some of our staff... perhaps others could fill 
in?   :)
