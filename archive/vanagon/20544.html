&gt; Owners of '71 busses take note. Many of you have probably already
&gt; discovered the secret of the little spring buried deep inside the
&gt; front-door lock mechanism that helps the lock control arm to rest in
&gt; the correct position. 
&gt; 
&gt; Tell me, does anybody know where to obtain a spring that will not
&gt; break? I have gotten them from wrecking yards, but they usually break
&gt; within a year. Then I have to pound on the door just above the latch
&gt; while wiggling the key to get the door to unlock from the outside.

Would this be something a locksmith could deal with? I'd kinda
like to find the answer to this, as you might be able to glean
from my .sig.
