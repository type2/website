Subject: Still FS: '89 Caravelle (Houston)

Still sitting at Mahan VW Used Cars (713-526-1711 Houston):

'89 Caravelle, 77k miles, std, a/c, pwr mirrors and steering, cruise, alloy
wheels.  It appears to be in very nice shape.  $9485

They haven't any idea why it's badged as a Caravelle (the story changes
slightly): the PO is/was a VW rep, but the vehicle was originally delivered
in Colorado (not Germany, as originally stated).
