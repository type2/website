&gt; &gt; I am a graduate student a the University of Colorado. I am doing research
&gt; &gt; on purchasing behavior. Could you gratious VW owners help me out? I own
&gt; &gt; an 82 Vanagon. Thanks in advance...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) What services do you do busines with on an ongoing basis? (for
&gt; &gt; example, grocery stores, banks, VW garages)
&gt; &gt;
     Albertsons supermarket, Chuck's seafood, Davey jones locker general
store, sigma chemical, biolabs inc., owl scientific plastics, sachs
bearings and steel, small world auto parts (aircooled
partsstore), u- lane- o credit union,
state farm auto insurance, american airlines, gene's german auto, mci and
gte, video and more, nfc bolt hardware, north's chuckwaggon a-y-c-e-
restaurant, that's all that comes to mind rite now... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Why do you do business there? (for example; trust, consistency,
&gt; &gt; commitment, philanthropy, empathy, status, switching costs, habit,
&gt; &gt; convienience, etc...)
&gt; &gt;
quality of products, price, can i trust them or not, do they stand behind
their product, how knowledgable are they about what they're
selling, friendlyness. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) Why do you do business there VS some where else? (for example; check #2)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;see above...problem is sometimes you don't really have that much of a
choice if you're living in a fishing village on the oregon coast...like,
there's only one place to get veedub parts, or you have to balance things,
like one guy is unfriendly yet knowledgable, the other one sweet but
clueless, then it depends on the product what i'm gonna do...
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4) What products or brands do you buy on a regular basis?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; stihl chain saws, mistral windsurfers, biolabs endonucleases, bosch auto
electric, janet lee butter, vw buses, sony and alpine electronics, american
airlines tickets, kinda see above...&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5) Why do you buy this product? (for example check #2)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;check #2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6) Why do you buy this product VS another product? (for example check #2)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;check #2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I really appreciate it. I will post the results if you all want to see them.
