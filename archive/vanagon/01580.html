&gt;i, uh, don't suppose i could interest you in a little how-to-grease-cv-joints
&gt;story? :)
&gt;
Yes!  Hal (er, Joel), I think some of us would be very interested
in a first hand account of how to go about it.  Especially interesting,
in true VW style, would be the various kludges neccessitated by 
inadequate tools and or space.
