Subject: Copy of: Getting bolts off calipers

&gt;I have an '84 Camper, and I'm trying to get the calipers off the front to
&gt;have the front calipers re-built, the right front is sticking, and keeps
&gt;fairly steady pressure on the pads so the wheel is somewhat resistant to
&gt;turning by hand.

Rick,

More common than a stuck caliper is a partially blocked rubber hose. I would be
especially suspicious if the caliper isn't leaking. Frequently, when the hoses
deteriorate, they will pass fluid under the high pressure of the power assisted
master cylinder, but will fail to release the fluid back when the pedal is
released. A simple check would be to remove the brake line from the back of the
caliper (nowhere else) and see if the caliper releases. If it does, the hose is
blocked. Replace them both, they're not too expensive. A whole lot less
expensive than calipers were for my '72 :(

You can buy a pretty effective made-in-China manual impact wrench for about $20
at most places that sell a good variety of tools. Use at least 3# of hammer with
it. Persistence pays off.


Good luck!
