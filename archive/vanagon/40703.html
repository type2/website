Subject: Re: cat trips

&gt;I will be taking my two cats on the road with me for the cross country tour.
&gt;Has anyone travelled with animals and if so what kind of advice can you give
&gt;me?  Dick and Fritz have travelled in the Westfalia to Mich. and back and they
&gt;did pretty well.  Dick loves the van and acts more like a dog (he likes to
&gt;stick his head out the window and is completely comfortable roaming around any
&gt;vehicle). Fritz, on the other hand, is a cat out and out. He handled the trip
&gt;by curling up behind the driver's seat and never moving. He would rather stay
&gt;at home and wait until we get back.  Problem is the Westy will be our only
&gt;home for five months.  I did get some kitty valium for Fritz if things get to
&gt;crazy for him.  I would love to hear from anyone who has experience travelling
&gt;with pets.

        Well, when I moved to Texas, Tosca came with me (from Los Angeles).
&gt;From LA to San Bernadino, he whined, then he had a wee bit of diharria in
the cat carrier. This is of course at 10:30pm. Found a gas station,
utilized the H20 hose, unstank the car, carrier, and cat. Continued to
Arizona, where the plan was to camp. Needless to say, camping was not so
cool with a loving cat that smelled like number 2. Found a motel that would
let us in, and we took a shower. He REALLY liked that. Drive 10 hours, then
take a shower. Every cats wet dream.

        Put him back in the carrier the next morning, got in the bus, and
started out. This was NOT going to be in the game plan for today.

        He flipped. Ranted, raved, and bit the cage. Complained LOUDLY.

        So down the road we found a pet shop and got a leash. Amazingly,
once he was out of the carrier, he became a great companion. Spent most of
his time on my lap, some on the passenger seat, and a lttle exploration of
the jungle of cargo. The remaining 900 miles or so were great.

        Unfortunately, he's forgotten how to travel. Last time we went for
a ride, he peed all over my flannel shirt. :-( How quickly they forget.

Peace,
