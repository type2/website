Subject: Re: Gas Gauge on 78 bus

all i can say mark is don't drill a hole in your gastank! i.e. cut the hole
at the top of the metal riser, wher it angles to go over the engine. i
believe the float is on the drivers side of the tank, but don't quote me on
that. Maybe check out a manual that show's the position of the float on a
78'.

&gt;My gas gauge is out on my 78' bus. 2 liter engine, 7 passenger. I know
&gt;the gauge in the dash is fine, and I was told it was probably the float
&gt;in the tank. I was also told the only way to get to the float was to
&gt;remove the engine, transmission, gas tank, etc.. I was wondering if it
&gt;was possible to nibble out a hole from the rear floor/riser behind the
&gt;rear seat to get access to the float, replace/fix it, then seal the hole
&gt;back up with tiger hair. Any thoughts? The main info I'd need is where
&gt;to cut the hole, plus any other ideas...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
