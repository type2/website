&gt;When the tank gets off of full it goes away.  He said that there was a

&gt;this??

I had a similar problem with my 85 Vanagon.  It turned out to be the fuel
recovery lines connected to the overflow bottles.  The fuel could only reach
these lines when the tank was fuel.

BTW, did you say this is an 86?  I believe from 86 to 88 (?) there was a
recall on the fuel tank and lines because of leaking fuel.  I posted the
recalls to the list a couple of weeks ago.  If you need it again, I can take
the time to find it and email it to you.
