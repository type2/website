Subject: Re: VW of America address anyone ???

Our local VW dealer just went *away* (well, they dropped the VW marque).  
They had had the dealership since 1964 (the original was in '55).  We've 
been without one for three years (the nearest is 75 miles away and is 
primarily a Ch***ler dealer).  And this in a town with a metro population 
of around 200,000 (!?).  Anybody want to start a dealership?
