&gt;I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both
&gt;thought it might be kind of fun to have a fall or even winter
&gt;gathering of west coasters from the list (anyone else who wants
&gt;to make the trip, welcome, too, of course!).  We both liked the
&gt;idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
&gt;even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
&gt;of Yosemite.  

Would love to, but it's too far, especially in the winter (brrrr!). Now,
what is this IRC thing &lt;and where can I get one? :-) &gt;
