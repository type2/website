Subject: Re: Wood paneling in 69 campmobile


&gt;Also, anyone replaced the wood panels, like the inside of the rear hatch? If
&gt;so, what type of wood did you use? Thanks,

Birch doorskin (1/8&quot;). I dunno what the original topcoat was, but I've been
using satin polyurethane. Birch ply is so cheap, I don't see any reason to
try to re-finish the old stuff. By the time you've sanded through the
cracks, you're through the first lamination. If I had it to do over, and
still had a shop, I'd probably shoot laquer on both sides of the ply BEFORE
I installed it. Make sure you finish both sides to avoid
telegraphing/cracking.
