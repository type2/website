Hi all: We have been using the Westfalia to move into our new home this
past week. Recently the engine began cutting out roughly 1-2 minutes after
a cold start. The engine would restart but only after cranking
continuously for about 20 seconds. The engine starts and runs fine
otherwise. In other words the problem only occurs when the engine is cold
and not hot. I haven't yet run a diagnostic test yet (we had snow today!)
but am guessing one of the following:

a) cold start valve - not sure what the connection might be here;
b) aux air intake - it is either not closing or closing too early;
c) gas pump relay - again a guess;
d) idle stabilizer.


Any insights would be appreciated - this is probably not an uncommon
problem for some of the list members.

The engine is an 82 aircooled.


Thanks BTW to David Schwarze for sending the Porsche sump plate with the oil
temp sensor - it fits perfectly.

Cheers- David Carment
