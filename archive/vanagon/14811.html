Subject: Re:'56 update -misc mumblings-still

&gt;$1800 for a clutch?  Sheesh!  Must be the ferramic, gold-plated version - 
&gt;I paid $400 for parts and $400 for labor.  And I got the parts from
&gt;Automotion (before I knew better!)

Yeah Thom, but did you get yuppie coffee and get to talk to someone German?:)
I don't remember if it was really $1800., if he had additional stuff done or
if I just focused on my Saturady afternoon and $30.00 clutch repair vs
paying a &quot;buttload&quot; of money.

Do you have the Porsche 6 in the '56?
