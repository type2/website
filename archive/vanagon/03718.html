Subject: Re: Oil pressure springs, etc.

As to oil pressure boosts, I now get about 40psi at highway
speed. I did get about 25-30 before. I dont know if the engine
was designed for 40 psi, as 25 psi may be giving the bearings all 
the oil they can handle, and the excess is just cooled and recycled.

Question for the net: Which way does the oil flow through the
oil cooler? I want to use a high pressure solvent blaster
to back-flow the cooler, and I was wondering which way to blast
it. Looking at the case, does the oil flow OUT the FRONT or BACK hole?
