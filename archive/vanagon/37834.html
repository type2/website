Subject: ?? Power for stereo in my '86 Vanagon

Dear Experts:
   I replaced the stereo in Vanagon this weekend, and all works
well except... it's not switched with the ignition.  The previous
radio was always enabled, and I tried to correct it.  I don't have
the wiring diagram for the Vanagon, so here's my puzzle:
   There is a stock looking connector with four sections that
appears to be the original radio power harnass:

             from left   to rt.  
                     \     /     \    /    \   /
      | open open | Blue Blue | Red Red | Brn Brn | 
                      ?????      power     Ground                     
                                   |- Radio  -|     

   My meter says the Blue wires are Ground, (O ohms to brown
wires).  I measure 12.3 volts across Red/Blue and across
Red/Brown no matter what position the ignition switch is in,
or whether there's a key in the slot.   

   Is there somewhere else I should be picking up switched 
power?  Please don't say I have to dismember the dash board.

I'm not on the mail list (too much traffic), so please direct
any suggestions to my work (tandem) mail address.  THANKS!
