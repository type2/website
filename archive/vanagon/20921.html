Subject: RE: Road Trip From Hell

I was very impressed by Bob Veeduber's self-sufficiency, but his story is a
reminder of one reason to drive a VW van:  If it works, you can drive it, 
and if it doesn't work, you can live there.

Regarding carrying a spare right-front spindle, I think spare parts are
magic.  I have never broken anything I had a spare one of in the car.
