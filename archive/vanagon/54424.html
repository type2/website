&gt; &lt;&lt;  Mastercraft are about as good as newer Craftsman
&gt;  tools, at half the price.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;   So who sells Mastercraft tools??

Mastercraft is the house brand of Canadian Tire Corp, a large Canada
wide chain of outlets which service cars/light trucks and sell parts and
stuff for cars/pickups and household: plumbing, electrical and camping
and garden .... like W*lm**t without the food and clothing.
By the way all Mastercraft tools are guaranteed for life, no receipt
required.
