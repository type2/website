Subject: Thanks....


It was getting a bit boring around vanagon-land the past week or so,
no major discussions...no fun...maybe its because whats-his-name
is back and we all have to behave...  ;-)

But I really have to say that of all the &quot;reading&quot; material that I
go through a week (work/pleasure/fun)...this and VintagVW is some
of the best. I'm glad the EuroVan v Vanagon v Chrodge Shitbox
discussion has blossomed and gone on to some wonderful tangents.

Over in VintagVW-land there is a &quot;discussion&quot; about US mags and
UK mags (which I helped heat-up) and which VW mag was best...the
conclusion that I have been comming to myself, is that eventhough
we don't have &quot;pictures&quot; to our stories in the traditional sense,
the &quot;articles&quot; here and on VintagVW are probably the best, most
informative, and entertaining around...especially for the money...
especially where my &quot;connect&quot; is FREE!!!


Folks keep it up!

Ric
