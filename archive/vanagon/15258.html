&gt;&gt;     What is the capacity of the '67 tank?  I was told the capacity on
&gt;&gt; the '56 tank was 11.1 gallons; a friend told me he thinks the capacity on the
&gt;&gt; '67 was 15 Gallons or so.  Anyone have a reliable source of info for this?
&gt;&gt; (ie owners manual)
&gt;
&gt;He must have a four gallon gas can hidden somewhere in his bus.  My 
&gt;'67 stops at $10.00-$11.00 when I fill it up.

I did some close eyeballing this weekend, and talked with a local bus guru,
and learned that while the '67 tank is larger, the extra area is for
expansion, and doesn't give you any added capacity, or at least nothing
to write home and tell mom about.

I'm gonna head to the junkyard this week some time and try to find a '71
or later tank, and see if I can shoehorn it in there...  The extra
capacity shure would be nice...  And I wanna put the cover piece on, too.
I imagine it would help keep the noise down a wee bit, and keep the has 
cooler!
