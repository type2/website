&gt;Had I heard of Branard's U Haul hitch, I would have considered one. I was
&gt;warned that the &quot;towing eyelet&quot;  was a &quot;lashing&quot; or a tie-down device for
&gt;shipment of the vehicle.  I have not confirmed that information.
&gt;
&gt;

I have one of those trailer hitches that mounts to the tow hooks. I got it
used at a U-pull it yard for 50 bucks. Tongue weight is 500lbs., and towing
weight is 1500lbs., I believe. I think that anyone who is pulling something
that weighs anymore than 1500lbs. or so with a 4 cyl Vanagon, should think
twice about what they are concieveably doing to their engine anyway....   The
trailer hitch mounts by clamping to the tow hooks.  The tow hooks are plenty
strong, as I've pulled other vw's around in the driveway with just one. You
do not have to cut up the bumper with this kind of trailer hitch.

p.s. anyone got thru to Branard?  aol says his address is not current.
