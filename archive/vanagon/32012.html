By far the funniest I remember (tragic, in retrospect) was the changeover
from the splitties to the bubblewindows in 1968.  Ad starts with the split
facing the camera, with the announcer talking about how it's time to get
rid of the old design, at which time the bus explodes into tiny fragments.
It's replace by a bubblewindow, and the announcer describes all the
improvements.  Just when you think the ad's over, he says something like
&quot;but maybe someday we'll replace this one&quot; and the bus explodes into small
pieces!

Wish VW would bring back that good old sense of humor they had in those days!
