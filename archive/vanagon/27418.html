Subject: what are sealing rings?


Rick,

I see that you had &quot;real head gaskets (aka sealing rings)&quot; 
installed. Is this a wasserboxer? What are &quot;sealing rings&quot;?
Do these replace the head gasket? My '86 has the drip, not
too bad yet, but I'll have to deal with this problem sometime
in the not too distant future :(
