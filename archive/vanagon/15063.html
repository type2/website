On Wed, 5 Apr 1995 Alistair Bell &lt;ui775_at_freenet.victoria.bc_dot_ca&gt; responded:

&gt;Sagging torsion bars?  About 4 years ago, one of those hot VW mags did a
&gt;71 westy restoration project and they described, quite nicely, how to
&gt;re-adjust the rear torsion bars.
&gt;I may still have that issue...

I think it was the May (or March?) 1990 edition of HotVWs.
My copy of the mag is at home somewhere.  It looks like a
'72 Westy in the step-by-step procedure and photos so it'll
probably fit on a '74.

Someday I'll do this to my '73 so I kept the issue.
