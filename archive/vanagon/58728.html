Last week I got a whole bunch of brochures about the EV and it's big
brother LT. A lot of information and pictures in there. Someone
interested in specific details?

I have a 1996 German Caravelle/Multivan brochure which features some Germans
in some very ugly clothing and lots of EV pictures with great features. 
 They
include leather, automatic climate control, quad seating, power moonroof, 
and
Syncro.

&gt;From what I could make from the brochure it's only available on
Caravelle/Multivan TDI models, which I thought was odd.  They feature the 
red
Syncro throughout brochure towing a horse trailer, and was filled with some
other great photos.
