&gt; I'm still looking for decent replacement tires for my EV. After owning

&gt; 205-65-15's with a &quot;Reinforced Sidewall.&quot; Now I've heard nothing but
&gt; good stuff about Nokian Tires from Finland and even found a dealer in
&gt; Wisconsin who will mail them to me (the NRW M+S tire). The only prob-
&gt; lem is that these tires do not say &quot;Reinforced&quot; on them. Yet the Nokian
&gt; dealer looked up the 93 EV is his handbook and it listed these particular
&gt; tires as the right ones. I called two local VW dealers and they both
&gt; incanted &quot;Reinforced&quot; several times, &quot;because the tires you have on the
&gt; van say that.&quot; The Conti CS 21's I have have 5 plies on the tread and
&gt; 2 on the sidewall; the Nokians are 4 x 2. So....who do I believe??
&gt; Is anything done differently to the sidewall in a reinforced tire??
&gt;
&gt; BTW, the Contis are ok, but nothing special, as far as I can tell.

Hi Hal:
Actually, I must have missed the bad news about Michelins, have to check
the archives.  I put them on my EV (don't know the exact tire, as the
spousal unit and the tykes have the van at the mall, but I'll check and get
back to you), and so far (10K miles), they've been quite great.  I'm a
little surprised at the pressure requirements listed on the door - 37psi
front and 48 rear or something like that, but the vehicle definitely
handles remarkably when pressured up.  The van had alloy wheels on it when
I bought it.  Not what I would have picked, but they are nice-looking
7-spoke dudes.  Don't know how, or if, that has anything to do with the
handling.  Take the stock size tires, though.

&gt;      My sympathies to Tim Parker for his EV horror story.

Thanks.  Like I say, other than that 6 month period, which was quite
painful, it's been an awesome van.  My main reason for revealing the story
to the list is pretty selfish, actually 8').  I heard a rumor from a friend
at work that others were having transmission trouble with the 5-speed, and
wanted to air it and see if others know anything about it.

I had an 80 westy with 100K on it when I bought it, and though it is an
excellent camper, mine was a mechanical nightmare.  Paid 4K for it, but put
another 3K in 2 years to keep it running (was down about 6 months while I
tried to find time and cash to fix it).  That was in 89, when I couldn't
find anybody to reuild heads for under 200 bucks, and new ones were only
available from the dealer for over 600.  Had valve seats come out twice in
the 2 years.  I do my own mechanical work, minus machining, and except for
a couple of mistakes I need to add to the &quot;idiot&quot; thread, am pretty
confident that the problems weren't just ME.

&gt;      In short this van is fantastic. It's the best kept (or should I say most
&gt; overlooked) secret on the road. Great heat, handling, comfort, space,
&gt;accelera-
&gt; tion. It's the only European van on the market here and it's quality is second
&gt; to none. We test drove most of the others. THose who lamented earlier this
&gt; fall about the plastic on the newer VW's should check out their chintzy compe-
&gt; tition. Type I-III owners take note: if you can find and afford an EV, snap
&gt; it up.

Yep, I agree.  I only wish I had the bucks for a camper, or at least a
weekender MV.  Weren't any of those available (except the Winnie Bagoo
-[sung to the tune of &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;] for 34K) when I bought my GL.  I
figure, for about 16K I saved (paid 18.3K for mine with the fancy wheels
and ABS) I can do amazing things with plywood to make it campable.  Wait
till the warranty burns out, though (though I am thinking about removable
stuff, like I built for my 67 Microbus).
