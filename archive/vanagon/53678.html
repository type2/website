According to my owner's manual:

#2 is same as #1, except right side
#3 is low beam left, 8 amps
#4 is same as #3, except right side
#5 is high beam left and indicator lights, 8 amps
#6 is high beam right, 8 amps
#7 is accessories and radiator fan, 16 amps
#8 is interior lights, cig. lighter, stop lights, 8 amps
#9 is hazard flasher, 16 amps
#10 is windshield wiper/washer pump, rear window defogger, 16 amps
#11 is turn signals, 8 amps
#12 is horn and backup lights, 8 amps
There are some others, if you have optional equipment like the auxillary
heater.
