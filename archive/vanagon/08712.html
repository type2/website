Subject: Flannel Report

 As most of you already know, several of the Bay Area listmembers gathered for
 pizza last night. I will leave it for someone more articulate to describe 
 all the goings-on but thought I should give a brief accounting on the
 flannel / non-flannel surprises that emerged.

    A) Martha was dressed exquisitly, in a *flannel free* outfit

    B) Flannel wearers were: Sami, Patrick, my daughter Siena, Sami's lovely
       wife Maria may have been wearing flannel (at his urging?), but I don't 
       remember. Another flannel maybe is Jim Macklow, who arrived late and
       missed the flannel count.

    C) Flannel or not, it is now a safe assumption that VW bus owners are a
       real fun bunch of characters (but you knew that already, right?)


  In the parking lot were representatives of all generations of Transporters
  EXCEPT the dyslexivan. 
  
  
  It was a fun evening.
