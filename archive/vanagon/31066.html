'81 Vanagon 2.0L Rebuild Update:

Now I'm agonizing over an oil cooler... the bus developed a minor
bearing-knock at start-up a few years ago (like every other vehicle
I've ever owned... what gives?  Cold weather?), I found silvery
metal flakesdown in the bottom of the oil strainer, so if I recall,
list-wisdom is that a new one is in order.  Well, the prices are steep:
$154 from Hoy Fox :( Can get a rebuilt one for $40, but how do
I know it doesn't have metal flakes in it?

Any comments on the oil cooler question?

The heads are back from Mark Stevens ($488 for four major
and 2 minor cracks + rebuild), the cam and lifters are back from
Weber ($75, no problems, although I'm wishing I'd maybe gotten a
higher performance grind :), the new engine compartment gasket
is here ($50).
