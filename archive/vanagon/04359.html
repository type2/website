&gt;The Volksdoktor offered the same work (and 6+6 warranty) for a grand total of
&gt;$265.00 (est.).
&gt;
&gt;Can you guess where I'm going? Also, VW was about to charge me for the
&gt;alignment they surely didn't do BEFORE the other work they wanted to do. DAMN!
&gt;These guys piss me off. I've had a bad VW week! :-(
&gt;

  I rest my case M'lud.
