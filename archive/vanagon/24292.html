Subject: Re: VW-'71 BUS-QUESTION ABOUT MOUNTING BOLTS


&gt;&gt;do I really need to get the upper left bolt on?

&gt;        I've never used that bolt-don't think I've ever even seen one
&gt;installed. 50k miles on 2 vw's, engine hasn't fallen out yet...  I would
&gt;think that the rear engine support for '68-71 busses makes this fourth bolt
&gt;even more redundant than it normally is.


Yup-- until you hit that REALLY, REALLY big bump you weren't expecting.
Then you'll find out just how much VW engines resemble aircraft engines.
Obviously you haven't hit it yet, and maybe you never will. What the
hell, why pay an extra $4.95 for a lousy bolt you'll PROBABLY never use?

P.S. Are some of your wheels missing a lug?
