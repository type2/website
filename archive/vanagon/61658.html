Subject: burning plastic

Hey all,
OK, I'm not even a member of the CCC (I live on the east coast) but I've
got to stick my neck out on this as it's getting really stupid at this
point.

1st:  Martha, you have absolutely no good reason to burn plastic.  I
don't know why you would insist on burning it know that you know the
effects.  Cancer is NOT FUN.  Glen posted a very well-written and
well-though-out article responding logically to your questions.  Burning
plastic can't be that much of a turn-on.

2nd:  What is this baby bickering BS?  &quot;Oh, I'm not going if she's
going&quot; or &quot;I'm not going if he's going.&quot;  OK, we're not in third grade
anymore so let's get over it.  There's no reason to break up the
legendary CCC over something as stupid as burning plastic.  It should be
as clear as day at this point that burning plastic on a campfire is
bad.  Very bad.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO CONTINUE DOING IT --
continuing to burn plastic at CCC campouts knowing what you know now
would show ignorance of the facts, irresponsibility, and petty
vindictiveness.

I've never seen fighting like this on the list.  I can understand Martha
not wanting to be on the losing end of the battle, but in this case,
stubbornness isn't going to get you anywhere and could very well give
you a life-threatening illness.  It's really not worth it.

And I apologize if this sounds like &quot;gang up on Martha day.&quot;  I am sure
Martha is a fine individual (anyone who drives an air-cooled Vanagon
must be :-) ) and an asset to the list.  I just happen to disagree with
her on this issue (and it seems like most other CCC members do too). 
There's no reason to break up the CCC over this issue.  If you want to
have an intelligent debate, fine, but quit this third-grade BS that's
going on.  It's really embarassing.  

I'm sorry if I'm out of line posting this message, but this is how I
feel about the issue as I see it on the list.

Sean
