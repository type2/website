Subject: Re: Need key for 88 Vanagon


A guy at the Manassas show has original keyblanks, was around $7 I
remember- he cuts the key on actual master cutter, not from copying an old
key contour- give him your tumbler number (look at it, he can cut the exact
key.  Won't do it by phone or mail- you must send him an actual tumbler;
easiest he said was from rear hatch door.  Mike Benthin
