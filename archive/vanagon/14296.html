Subject: RE: Rabbit/Jetta engine swap

Hi, thanks to John, Alister and Bill for the responses. It is a conversion 
of an '87 Syncro that I am contemplating. I'm looking at a tired exhaust 
system and usual coolant drips, which will all cost $1500Cdn to do in a year 
or so, hence the enquiry. 
        Reliability  and durability are the main factors in picking the 
engine. And out here, availability. I want to equal or better the current 
95HP from the wasserboxer 2.1, 125HP would be nice, 30% increase. The Syncro 
trans does NOT sound reliable 2 posters have had replacements, How strong? I 
don't know either, 140HP?, but KEP don't mention any problems and they do 
talk about welding up 3rd/4th gears in the breadloaf trans for V6/V8 
conversions. YMMV.
        The Syncro has a subframe that lowers the engine slightly, I would 
guess 1-2 inches max. This would help. The skid plate may screw all this up 
since it passes pretty close to the wasserboxer oil pan. Gearing on gasoline 
engined Vanagons is higher than diesels I think, so mileage/RPM should be 
OK? I like the idea of DigifantII engine, seems a simpler (and modern) FI 
installation.
        Parts I need will be: diesel bell housing (or adapter from KEP)
                              engine mounts, from diesel 
                              oil pan, pump, and pickup, ditto
                              Dasher exhaust manifold
                              and .... ???
