Subject: Re: A/C in a diesel Vanagon

Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 26-Jun-95 A/C in a diesel
Vanagon by Cetin Seren_at_kirk.bellcor 
&gt; I have looked into it.  The trouble is, the poor diesel engine puts out
&gt; 47 hp max.  And the Westy, with all its bulk, leaves no margin for
&gt; the 6-7 hp that the AC will require at full blast.  I decided it was not
&gt; worth it.

Besides, there's a LARGE warning label on my '83 diesel stating that the
cooling system doesn't have the reserve capacity to deal with the A/C,
either.

Even WITHOUT all of the westie stuff, 
(mines just a vanagon with plywood inna back and a futon.... Poor mans westie?)
some of Pittsburgh's hills DEMAND 1st gear....  I wouldn't be bale to
climb them with much extra wieght...
