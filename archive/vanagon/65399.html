Subject:      Yokohama Y370D 195/75 R14

I have seen it said in the thread lately that these tires are no longer
being manufactured.  Today I had a new set put on my 91 Westy at $72 a
tire.  SO...unless these are old stock (look brand new), they ARE being
manufactured, and I hope they are as good as everyone says they are.
Here's what I know about them:

Yokohama Y370D 195/75 R14
8 ply side walls
Load range &quot;d&quot;
40k mileage warranty

Vanagon_dot_com says 45 psi front and 52 psi rear is recommended.  Anyone
have any thoughts as too whether or not this is a good pressure?  I
think the tire place left at around 35 psi.  (The tires have a max psi
of 61, I think)
