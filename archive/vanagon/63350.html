Malcolm and all -
At the Placerville Gold Country VW show a non-Syncro Tristar was on
display!
It was an '88 that the owner (Dennis Cooper) got from Canada.  All I got
was
a very short answer (he was leaving) to some basic questions.  He is
located in
California, somewhere south of Sacramento I think.  He spent LOTS of $
to get
it to the states, but didn't want to spend the additional $8000 for the
Syncro
package.  His impression is that the only difference between a TriStar
and a
double cab is the 4th door, but I suspect that trim, and other goodies
were
also involved.  Very nice dark red color, ran really quiet.  Until the
owner
showed up, it looked like I was doin' pushups, checking it for the
Syncro drive
train!

&gt; Where in the North West (US) are the Tristar Syncro's available?  Are
&gt; they imported via grey market or can dealers order them?  Are they
still
&gt; in production or did the Eurovan replace them (hope not).  Truly a
well
&gt; layed out site.  I Bookmarked it and will return often.  Thanks.

These were built between 1988(?) and 1991 only.  It is probably not
feasible
to bring a non-Canadian one into the US, as the restrictions got intense
around 1988.

I don't know for certain, but I believe that the
TriStars were made both in syncro and non-syncro form.  All the TriStars
were fabulously expensive compared to the standard DoubleCab, which
might
explain why so few were sold.
