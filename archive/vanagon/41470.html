Subject: Poptop Seal

Hi All,

Replaced the poptop and luggage rack seal this past weekend.  Got the seals
from California Import parts for $70 and $22 plus $9 for weatherstripping
cement.  Whole process was very easy and the new seals seem better than OEM.
 I didn't however, change the flat seal across the top of the poptop.  Put on
a new Westy sticker too for $9.  Looks great!
