&lt;&lt; got my pump off this weekend.  my crossover pipes sure have a lot of rust
 happening inside -- concerns me.  hate to have one fail on a road trip.
 
 what's the corporate memory on crossover pipes?
 
 recall discussions here saying they're not available from VW anymore and
 nigh on impossible to find.  so what's the solution? &gt;&gt;

I have recently obtained these.  Do not remember cost.  If original in good
shape, fing plating shop to Cadmium plate it.  Rust no more.
