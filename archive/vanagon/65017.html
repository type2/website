Don -

I had to replace this on my 84 Westy earlier this year because I broke
the 8mm pushon fitting that the bypass hose connected to (I will remember
to CUT the hose next time, not pull it off).

Part Numbers:

025-121-082  Manual Transmission Models

025-121-082A  Automatic Transmission Models

Price for either one lists for $42.40 in the latest VOA Parts Price List.

&gt;My '85 has developed a very slow leak from the plastic fitting that
&gt;connects the upper and lower radiator hoses and mounts on the firewall
&gt;of
&gt;the van (back of the engine compartments).  This fitting also contains
&gt;the
&gt;knob for the bleeder valve that you open up to bleed the air bubbles
&gt;while
&gt;the front bleed screw is open.  Does anyone have a part number for
&gt;this so
&gt;I can compare my local dealer for prices with Camelback?  I'm sure the
&gt;part
&gt;is going to cost some bucks and should be worth shopping around.
