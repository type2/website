Subject:       New home for tent pages

First, let me thank all those who offered advice or space to store 
the near-orphan tent pages:
Sami Dakhlia
Ron Lussier (lost your email address, Ron)
David Schwarze
Gerald &quot;running the list isn't enough hassle&quot; Skerbitz
Rusty VanBondo

Folks, next time you're heading downhill, shift to a lower gear and 
give these guys a well-deserved twenty-one-backfire salute.  &lt;snif&gt; 
People on this list are great -- and me just a wannabus.

Second, hats off and a set of NOS breadloaf safaris to Dieter Dworkin 
Muller, who's now hosting all the subpages.  He patiently sat through 
the download of six .html files and _83_ images, up to 150kb in size, 
uudecoded them, and put 'em in their new home.  You're a good man, 
Charlie Brown.

Third, for those of you who have links or bookmarks to the tent page 
- relax!  The main tent page will stay at its original URL (see 
below), so unless you're totally anal and have linked to the 
sub-pages (foyer.html et al) you don't have to change a thing.  Gotta 
love that web!

Fourth, please don't hassle Dworkin with questions about grommet 
sizes, number of stakes, how to soften the rain-gutter clip, or 
offers of free like-new tents.  I'll still be the &quot;tentmaster&quot; as far 
as updating the pages, etc.  (They're mine, I tell you! MINE! :)

Thanks again for all the support!  And as a person of (distant) Scots 
extraction, I'm happy to see this resource stay on the 'net at no 
cost to anyone.  Och, laddyes.

The main Westy Tent Page (I finally renamed it &quot;Volkswagen Canvas&quot;) is 
still at http://www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/tents.html.  It's best viewed 
with the mother of all browsers, v1.2N, but should at least be 
accessible even with Lynx (can't forget my pre-Windows days).  Some 
of the inline thumbnails are jpegs (sorry, non-Netscape GUI browsers), 
but you ought to be able to at least download the fullsize images and view 
'em with LView or whatever floats yer boat.

Joe
