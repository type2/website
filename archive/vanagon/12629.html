&gt;Double-door vehicles are rare. Period.

I guess I haven't ever thought of them as being rare.  Like I said, a
double-door Kombi or Deluxe is rare to me.  I guess everyone's definition of
&quot;rare&quot; is different.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Don't want any hack jobs.

&gt;&gt; bigger rear wheels.&quot;  He responds &quot;Don't want any hack jobs.&quot;  Buy your
&gt;&gt; vehicle in Minnesota then.  Be sure to get one that already has the 
&gt;&gt; rusted out rear wheel arches replaced so you don't end up with a&quot; hack 
&gt;&gt; job&quot;.  How much do those arches cost, $50-100 each plus installation?
&gt;
&gt;I agree.  Let's not forget, though, he's really from California --- 
&gt;you Californians want to claim him ?
&gt;I think we need to see an apology on this list.

Appology for what?  Like I told him, it was not personal.  Chill out!

&gt;Thanks for your help, Jim.
