Subject: window leaks &amp; wiper control

Hello All,

Well it's been raining in these parts lately and I've
noticed two problems. First I have water leaking through
the driver side sliding window. There is also a little
surface rust under the window seal. So I'm planning on
replacing the seal with one from WCM. Are people happy
with the seals from WCM? Also it looks like there is some
water seepage through the window frame, any ideas on how to 
fix that, a new/used window? This side of the van had a dent
in it when I bought it, the leak could be a result of that.

Second problem, the front windshield washer doesn't always 
work and the rear hatch wiper/washer doesn't always work
either. I'm thinking of getting some spray electircal cleaner
and spraying into the steering column where the wiper contol
stalk enters. Is this a good idea?

Good news, I had a leak from the pop top skylight that I've
rixed by replacing it's seal. The new seal was $40, a tad bit
expensive, from Euro-American (Delta Six). It was easy to 
install, removed old one, cleaned up surface, heated up a big
pot of water and put the new seal into the water so that it
was more pliable. Then I installed it. No silicon sealer.
Works great, no more leaks, from there.
