&lt;&lt; Hi Gang:    Anyone out there know the mfg., address and price of the rear 
 hitch that mounts on the 'tow eyes'? I have a '86 Westy. I want to tow my 
 '72 Bug, can do? 
 
 Thanks, &gt;&gt;


I bought one from U-haul.  They said the hitch for my Syncro had a different
number than the one for the 2WD Vanagon, but what I ended up with was the one
that mounts on the 'tow eyes'.

However, I think the '72 Bug exceeds the reccommended maximum weight.

Any U-Haul &quot;Factory Center&quot; should have them.
