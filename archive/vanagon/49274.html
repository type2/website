Edie querries:
&gt;Questions:
&gt;Should I be concerned about purchasing a EV Weekender because
&gt;there were so few made.  Is there any reason to be afraid?  The
&gt;engine is an Audi?  So, should parts be hard to come by if (forbid)
&gt;there were problems?

Based on your &quot;wishlist&quot; I would suggest you look for the an EV/MV, =
which is the Weekender w/o the poptop and the &quot;six pack&quot; cooler under =
the jump seat which IMHO is worthless...you can do better by removing a =
jump seat when you camp and replace it with one of those Iglo Electric =
Coolers...

On to the reliability,etc...first off close to a million T4s (VWs =
designation for the EV) have been built...unfortunately only about 8500 =
were sold in the US..so parts are available.

As to the AUDI engine...VW owns AUDI, the 5 cyl engine came from the =
AUDI 5000 series and is as bullet-proof an engine as one can get...if =
taken care of properly, it should deliver &gt;200k miles.
                       =20

I have 50k miles on my 93 EV....my family use it as your typical family =
hauler, delivery van, pick-up and camper....we love it (although I admit =
I have been tempted by the odd Synchro-Westy camper from time to time).

If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.
