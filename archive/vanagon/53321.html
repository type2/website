Subject: RE: For Sale: '80 Vanagon w/Chevy V6 engine


Sorry, Chris, I'm just in &quot;peddle&quot; mode for now. Had to leave the list
for a forecast employment change (which never happened as it turned out,
just changed departments), and also to cut down the mail volume a little.

Well, yes, changed a little... or at least, circumstances have. With
work, single-parenting, etc. (insert standard whiny excuse here), I
just can't keep a 16-year-old toy around-- even a fun one like the
V6anagon.

Budget is pretty limited, so new German vans are out (does VW even
market a van in the U.S. nowadays?). The German vans we all know and
love, that are in my price range, have like 100,000+ miles on them,
and I already have one like that. Previas are expensive, and so that
leaves the (fairly) decently-built American versions. Considered a
Ford full-size van, but also up there in price, and tough to park
in condos like where I live-- where's that VW maneuverability when
you need it? So, picked a FoundOnRoadDead mini-product, $15K for a
new '96 with Auto, AC, PS, PB, AM/FM, LS/MFT. Snagged a dealer's
loss-leader &quot;Ad Car&quot;.

So, regretfully, the V6anagon must find a new and loving home. Hopefully
one that understands the vagaries of VWs, and likes to tinker. But,
it comes with a redeeming feature: An original, genuine, shiny List
Sticker on the rear window! And an extra, pristine, unused one in the
glove compartment.

Maybe I should sell the sticker for $1,000 and toss in the V6anagon
for free?

I'm not on the list presently, so please reply to me directly at

I shall return!

Steve



&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;Are you back or are you just here to peddle your ride and disappear
&gt;again?  Why have you gone to the dark side (US Minivans)?  What happened
&gt;to you while you were away?  You've changed!

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Finally bought an Aerostar, so the V6anagon has to go.
&gt;    &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'd like to get $1,000 for it.
