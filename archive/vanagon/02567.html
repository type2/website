Subject: Tygon tubing



	

	When the subject of fuel tank repair/replacement
	was being discussed, someone (sorry I can't remember who),
	mention that they had replaced stock lines with
	Tygon tubing. I just noticed that according to
	a Cole-Palmer chemical compatibility and tubing
	chart, regular food grade Tygon is not recommended
	for gasoline, and Tygon special(?) will show some
	minor change upon exposure to gasoline.
	(Viton tubing seems to be good in gas, and is heat
	resistant)

	I don't mean to be an alarmist, but maybe check the
	tubing just to be safe.
