Hi, Mike

Currently neither the Millers nor we are using external
racks for bike transporting purposes; Ken refuses to get
a roof rack, and I refuse to use the typical (POS) hatch
strap &amp; baling wire setup after an unpleasant experience.

One rack that I would personally like to have and use is
called (I think) &quot;Draftmaster.&quot;  I've actually seen one
of these on an EV hauling a tandem (which we both have),
and except for the captain's h-bar sticking over the top
of the roof, the entire setup is entirely within the slip
stream of the van.  Unfortunately, the EV was headed in
the opposite direction...  :(   You could probably find
more info on these racks at your FLBS.  What I'll end up
doing sometime in the not so distant future is to cut some
2x4s the width of a h-bar and bolt some BikeTights onto
them for use inside the EV.  As it is right now, I just
roll the whole bike into the center section, close the
door and go; you sure can't beat that for security.
