I am in Illinois and my son is in Virgiinia Beach with a '77 bus.  The engine
seems to be cutting out when the RPMs get high.  We have been doing some long
distance diagnostics.  My thoughts were to look for air leaks around the air
box.  Told him to spray some carb cleaner around the hoses with the engine
running.  Any other thoughts?  Anyone able to give some hands-on assistance,
if needed?
