(My brother just sent me this EMail after we purchased an '86 Vanagon GL 3000
miles away.)


Janet,

Just read about the German conspiracy.

==============================================================
Important fact that I forgot to mention in BNW of VW: Herr Dr. Ing. Piêch - 
like all the syncro vanagons - is of austrian origin (Porsche clan) so to be 
precise it should be &quot;Austrian conspiracy&quot;. Strange about that: over here the 
vehicles are called &quot;California&quot; &quot;Kombi&quot; or &quot;Bully&quot; - but symptoms of the 
disease are exactly the same. So there must be something else that makes you 
an addict. Ask your local &quot;dealer&quot; ...

Seems some research still to be done ...
