Subject: Re: Yokohama Y370 vs. Y356

    Wow this is getting interesting...

    When I worked for Costco('92-'96), we carried the Y356 in a &quot;C&quot; load
range 205/70R-14 w/ a 60K wearout warranty... cost was about $50 a tire
+ /- , it was a passenger tire!

    about 2 years ago we stopped carrying that tire as Yokohama said it
was no longer in production...  availiable for Road hazard warranties
only

    Now they say they produce a Y356 LT in 195/75R-14 in both C and D
load ranges...

    Tires I purchased wore out on the front in about 45K... rears I
purchased about 12K later and they are a bit weatherchecked but
otherwise plenty of tread ( I do yearly alignments, but don't do
rotations)

    I wonder what is going on...

    BTW, I really liked the way the tire handled in All weather
conditions ( I live in NH)
    kept the tires at 36 in the rear and 34 in the front...
