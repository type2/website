now ... that last bunch of Technical Books are just that: technical. but they
are NOT (repeat NOT) service manuals ... more like a textbook for a seminar
on those topics. interesting? well ... yeah. useful? well ... maybe. neat to
look at? sure. but how it relates to the dirty grimy thing you just struggled
to remove from you are? probably not too closely. you kinda have to see one
of the books to know what i mean. :(  but i would recommend any wannabe-
mechanics to call Bosch and get a catalog.

the Automotive Handbook is pretty neat, but just crammed full of all sorts
of math formulas for braking distance, battery charging, etc.  a little
pricey and technical for daily use, but still pretty neat.

the Electric/Electronic Handbook seems to be a collection of the little
technical books, although edited down in size a bit. haven't gotten much
use out of it yet.
