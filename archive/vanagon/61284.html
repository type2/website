All this talk about the front table; mine has been sitting in the garage
for years!  Can't figure out why anyone would want it!  Gets in the way,
can't leave anything on it while under way, takes up space, and there's
always the one in the rear.

Is the reason yawls tables are missing is the previous owner lost them?
