Subject: Re: Bus as primary residence...

I was an art student at Northern Arizona University /NAU (Flagstaff, AZ) in
the early 70's. It was almost the norm to have some folks attend classes and
actually receive advanced degrees while living in the nearby forests in
buses, vw vans, and TeePees. Do you know how to spell &quot;Hippies&quot;? I was lucky
to live on the back porch of a house RIGHT next to the railroad tracks. The
house was also slowly sliding down the hill. All of the doors looked like
something off of PeeWee's playhouse. No PeeWee though! Where else could you
find a house inhabited half by hippie freaks and half by police science
majors, hard core redneck cowboys, vietnam vets, and rookie cops. We all had
fun. =) Hint: I didn't get a police science degree. 


  &gt;     As, this brings back the sweet(?) memories, when I lived in my
&gt;     '62 Deluxe in the campus parking lot, close to the gym, for toilets,
&gt;     showers and the sauna. I did have to move around because of the
&gt;     campus police, and for a while worked out a truce of sorts. Somehow
&gt;     the Deans office got word of my domicile, and I got called in...I
&gt;     pleaded that it was the only way I could attend college, and, after a
&gt;     bit, they GAVE me a vacant dorm room for the rest of the year, when I
&gt;     graduated!
&gt;
&gt;     These days, don't forget state parks and the like, some legal camping
&gt;     spots are close in to our cities. There is always the campground of
&gt;     last resort, the dreaded KOA - and let me tell you, there are always
&gt;     working people there living on the cheap.
