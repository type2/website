Subject: Splittie VW Emblem Anti-Theft Device

Hi All,

About a decade ago I when I was in college I drove my 63 Camper 
extensively and never experienced getting the front emblem 
swiped by any larcenous hands, although I had had others pilfered.  
How was this so?

Well, it had a dealer-installed theft deterrent device called a 
dual-mounted antenna installed in the middle of it.  I've always liked 
the way it accented the split in the windshield.  8-)
