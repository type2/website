&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;In regard to why certain years are popular, etc. all 
&gt;I have to say
&gt;&gt;&gt;is this...the &quot;cream&quot; ALWAYS rises to the top thats 
&gt;why there
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ahem...So do the turds! :)

Listen, bucko, if everyone had that kinda attitude we'd be 
sendin' all this junk usin' stamps instead of phones!!!   :P :P 
:P ;)

I can't think of anything horribly nasty that's still funny so 
I'm gonna go into the garden and eat worms.

&gt;If it ain't split, it ain't sh*t!!!

... and if it's a T4 it *ain't* sh*t.  Q.E.D.

&gt;Putting on my flame-retardant coveralls,

Boy, you'll need 'em ...  ;P

Don'cha feel sorry for the jealous volks ...

BTW, I was down at the river again ... the water is going down 
a bit.
Makes splashing passers-by more fun 'coz the chances of gettin' 
stuck is lessened ...  :)  And the only other Irish 
vanagon-lister was looking into the river too.  Quite a 
pastime, this flood-stuff.
