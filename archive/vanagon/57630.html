     The hybrid system uses a gasoline engine, an electric motor and an
     electric generator to achieve nearly twice the fuel efficiency of
     conventional gasoline engine cars, Toyota said.

     In a test Toyota conducted on city streets and highways, a car
     using this system traveled about 67 miles per gallon of gasoline,
     the company said.
