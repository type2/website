Subject: factory syncro shock absorbers

In the USA there is only one set of shocks for the syncro, but in Germany
they have *three* choices. Following are some part numbers from a microfiche
in Germany. 

Rear shocks shows 251 513 031 with an end letter of D for the 14 inch, N for
the 16 inch, and a J for the M469 option, which I guess meant for vehicles
with rough road equipment. We have a D here in the USA.

Hopefully, the front shocks for the 16&quot; version of the Vanagon would have
the effect of raising the vehicle further off the ground but we cannot tell
without actually ordering them to see. 

Boge is the manufacturer but they import only the standard factory shock
into the USA.

Description Of What I See In the Picture	/Part Number/German Name/	German
Description

Front Shocks/251-413-031-C/	Shock absorber For Vehicles With Tire size:14&quot;
(USA)	
as above	/251-413-031-M/Shock absorber For Vehicles With Rough Road
Equipment/M469
as above	/251-413-031-N/Shock absorber For Vehicles With Tire size:/16&quot;	

Rear Shocks/251-513-031-D/Shock absorber For Vehicles With Tire size:14&quot; (USA)
as above	251-513-031-N/Shock absorber For Vehicles With Tire size:16&quot;	
as above	251-513-031-J/vehicles made before 3/90 ?/Shock absorber For
Vehicles With Rough Road Equipment/M469
as above	251-513-031-M/vehicles made after 3/90 ?/shock absorber For
Vehicles With Rough Road Equipment/M469

Then, at M 469 in one place it says For Vehicles With Rough Road Equipment.
