Subject: 87' vanagon Westie head leak(?)

OK so now I've been initiated.. 

The fuel injection, power steering, alternator, exhust and heads have
been removed and cleaned.  No real evidence of leaking.  But now the
important stuff:

1. Is it normal for the cylinders to have small amounts of rust on the
   water jacket side???

2. Any suggestions where to take the heads for a valve job??

Thanks -- Dan
