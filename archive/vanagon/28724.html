&gt; A few years ago I saw an ad for a Synchro Crew Cab pickup and wondered if
&gt; anyone else has heard of this and if it was ever imported into the U.S.  I
&gt; think the ad appeared in a Northern California nickel want ad type
&gt; publication.

I personally saw one in Dayton at the Bug Jam in 1994.  Blue.  Aluminum
wheels.  Very Nice.  it was a '88 or a '90.  Owner said he was 3rd owner. 
First in Canada.  Second imported.  Third bought it for $20,000 US.
