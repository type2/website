Subject: RE: Syncro off road?

My experiences with the Syncro, excepting cost of maintenance, has been
all positive.  The system WORKS;  I've used mine on the beaches of Cape
Hatteras, state gamelands logging roads, and of course joy riding during 
snow storms.

Most problem areas have not been related to the syncro, excepting one front
CV joint replaced because I couldn't (wouldn't) take it apart myself in
-10 degrees weather.  I've had the standard fare (from the listings on this
list) of irratic idle, exhaust system replacement (pipes not the muffler),
CV joint noises and coolant system maintenance.

I now have 134K miles, and except for some loss in compression its still runningquite well.  The loss of compression is evident on hills, but it does not
use excessive oil.
