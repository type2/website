Subject: belts, belts, belts &amp; new motor update

I was scrounging thru the parts fiche (thanks Joel!) last night and 
figured I may as well look up the sizes for all the belts.  
I like to keep a spare, but don't like taking 'em off till the break. :-)  
Anyway, for all you folks with ancient belts, here are all the sizes:

PS Pump   9.5x1080
A/C      12.5x1153
Alt       9.5x1100
Applies to `86 (&amp;'87) with A/C and probably beyond.
=========================

I now have 400 miles on my factory rebuilt engine - it runs GREAT!
The only problems I've experienced have come from re-using too many 
old hoses and belts.  (I think you could spend again as much as the 
engine if you went ahead and replaced them all, so that isn't a solution.)

Still need a new PS pump hose ($200, ouch!) which is why I was scrounging 
thru the fiche.

The only weirdnesses in the engine swap out:

1)  VW forgot to put in a new TDC sensor.  This thing is tapped in 
BEHIND the flywheel.  Impossible to install without the flywheel off!

2) the distributor drive was NOT lined up correctly.  This isn't a big deal
unless the wires don't reach.  I was lucky here, tho I'm tempted to take
it to the dealer and make them fix it since you need a special tool to
get the distributor drive out.

3) The hydraulic lifters took an agonizingly long time to pump up the
first time I fired the engine up - no problems since.

4) the electric fuel pump didn't work.  The bus had been sitting 
for &gt; 6 months and it was just stuck.  I hot wired it directly to the
battery with jumper cables and that broke it loose.  The pump is grounded
to the frame which doesn't help ...

Nothing else major.  If you've replaced water pumps, alternators, hoses,
clutch, and exhaust systems you've done it all before and can do the whole
engine if need be.
