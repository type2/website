Subject: Re: Ball Joints

Replacing the ball joints it fairly simple, but not easy without a
nice BIG press.

I am currently doing all four on my '68 axle. The replacement joints
are relatively cheap (at about 15 UKP each) for German ones, and yes
they come with the rubber boot and a new big nut.

To replace them you have to remove the torsion arms, easy. Remove the
big not on the ball joint thread, it was easier to split the nut than
try and use a wrench. Use a claw clamp to remove the balljoint taper
from the steering knuckle - I used a big hammer because I didn't have
a big enough claw clamp and also I knew that I was replacing the ball
joint so it didn't matter if I wrecked the ball joint thread.

With the joint clear of the steering knuckle assembly, undo the nut
and grub screw on the end of the torsion arm near to where it pivots
in the beam tube. Then tap the torsion arm out of the tube with a
hammer - it should come slowly because the arm will still be under
pressure from the torsion springs. With the arm out, take it to a
shop with a BIG press and have them press out the old one and press
in the new one for you. I tried using a 10 tonne press to remove mine
and they wouldn't come - I've not got round to taking it to our local
'bus balljoint press' guy yet.
