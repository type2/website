Well not Bus related, but I'm actually sticking something
to VWoA and it's making me so happy I got to tell people.
Corrado has always had intermittent problem with the idle
air stabilizer/ aux air bypass valve whatever you want to call
it.  Most Digifant H20 VW's do, they gum up and give you an erratic
idle.  Only happens once in a while and never can prove it to
#$%_at_&amp;^$ dealer service man and just one more thing to piss me off.
So I'm driving and it happens, I go straight to dealer he taps
on it, revs go down and Whoopeeee, since I'm still under warranty
till Jan 1996, they eat the cost.  I could have kissed him,
heck I'm having them do a full check up just to see if they will
replace anything else since I'm at 47,500 maybe I'll get lucky.
