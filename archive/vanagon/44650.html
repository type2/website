Kevin inquires:

&gt;How big a deal is a reinforced tire? I do not haul anything heavier than
&gt;people and bicycles.

Here's an analogy that I think you can appreciate; think of an unreinforced 
tire as a clincher, and a reinforced tire as a sewup.  Which would you rather
ride?....because once in a while, you may want to haul ass, and not just
people
and bikes...   ;-)

I've got 25k on 205/65R/15 MXLs on our EV, and I push 'em hard sometimes;
if you can find them, they're pretty good tires.

ps-they suck on loose dirt and gravel up an 18 percent grade, so I wouldn't
re-
commend them for the Pikes Peak hillclimb...   =8^0
