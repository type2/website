Volks,
	David Easterwood (the guy with 42 VW's in his .Sig) sent me some
scans which I have placed on my web page.  If you've ever wanted to see
a picture of Dave, or his '59 Pickup, now you can!  Check out:

Oh, my picture is also up at my toplevel homepage.  People at BBTA said
they did not expect me to look like I do, for some reason...
