Subject: strange stalling 83 diesel

Hey Everyone,
What would cause an 83 diesel vanagon to start stalling?

When I first start the van up it runs great.  I pull out ant drive 100 
yards to a stop sign.  As I hit the breaks it begins to sputter then 
stalls.  I have to then crank it over longer than usual to git it to 
run.  I noticed a little bit of white smoke right after restart up.  It 
runs fine after this and does not stall until it sits for the night.  
This has happened maybe 4 times in the last month.  It seems as if it is 
running out of fuel when it stalls.

I also have noticed more haze/light-dark smoke during acceleration and 
normal driving.  It has never billowed smoke.  I first noticed the smoke 
at night as a car was tailgating me on the highway.  Looked hazy in the 
guys headlights. 

any answers --suggestions?
