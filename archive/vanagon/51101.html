Subject: Re: OIL API Service Levels...

&gt; I retyped the document and I have it in TXT format should anybody want 
&gt; to see it.  I didn't want to send the attachment to all 500+ of the 
&gt; list as this information is only relevent to diesel owners.  If 
&gt; anyone is interested, send me an email and I'll forward you a copy.  
Yes, please... Thx.

I had noticed the ratings disappearing also, but had not seen any 
official word about using SH in diesels. Some brands no longer 
mention diesel in the desciptions on the bottle, which makes me 
wonder. I had heard that CC/CD ratings also indicated an extra 
additive package in the oil designed to combat the corrosive 
conditions which build up in diesel engine oil over time.
Anyone know more on this?
