Subject: '75 Camper FS- $300 | 80westyFS (Phx, AZ, USA)

An aquaintence of mine is a hardcore full-time shade tree mechanic and gonzo
buyer/seller of VWs and UFOs (basically any vehicle). 
We were comparing notes on the sales market for VWs in Arizona's 110F heat. ;-P 
 
He has the remains of a customers '75 camper FS for $300 obo. It seems that
the customer &quot;somehow&quot; (don't ask) set the bus interior on fire. Supposedly
it *was* a pretty clean running/driving van. Motor and tranny *reportedly*
unaffected. In order to get anything you gotta take it all. I haven't seen
it. If anyone in the AZ/SOCAL/NM really wants it call &quot;Pete&quot; at (602)275-7774

Also 80 Westy FS. Mechanically Great but kinda beat bodywise. No rust some
collision damage. Both tables. $2,200.00 
Call &quot;Pete&quot; at (602)275-7774. Tell him Jim Ellis sent cha via the internet.

 Usual disclaimers apply...
