&gt; Greetings and happy Friday!

&gt; a question: is phosphate-free antifreeze necessarily NOT green? When I test
&gt; drove my Vanagon several months ago, the coolant level indicator came on.
&gt; The dealer promptly filled the expansion tank from a jug which was labeled
&gt; 'phosphate free' but was bright green in color. Isn't the ethylene glycol
&gt; responsible for the green color (as opposed to the phosphate)?
&gt; 
&gt; Someone please enlighten me.
&gt; 

- There is an anti-freeze called Sierra that is both green and
phosphate free.
