Subject: Re: New Westy Camper due in US?

I have a sale catalog which I borrowed form another list member (soon to be
returned) that shows 3 versions of a &quot;California Camper&quot;. All are on the short
wheelbase. All three roofs are different - although one is the Westfalia lift
design.

All three are full campers - just like the Westy/Euro shipped to Canada in '93.
One has a perminent bed up without a lift top (high roof). One has a mid-range
hight roof and only one bed down, the third is like we all know.

Perhaps one of these will come to the US?
