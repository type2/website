&gt;If you don't like spam, I'll have yours, I LOVE it.  I'm having the spam,
&gt;spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam baked beans spam spam
&gt;and spam!
&gt;Baked beans are off!
&gt;Well then, can I have spam instead of the baked beans, then???

sniff! sniff! ... i smell Month Python.

or maybe just Spam. :)

wonder who ever thought up Spam? and why?  every wonder why you don't have
chicken spam? or fish spam? or pork spam?  (actually, the army had some stuff
in c-rations that was pretty close to pork spam ... with a lot of tabasco
sauce, it wasn't tooooo bad. just couldn't take those Ham and MF's, though!)
