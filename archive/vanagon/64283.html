Stephen,

&lt;&lt;   you wrote . . . Has anyone come up with a great place to put a
CD changer in a Westy?  I was thinking in the cabinet, under the
sink.  Any other ideas?  &gt;&gt;

   Well I'm not certain that it's a great place, but mine sits vertically
behind the driver's seat, resting on non-skid material to keep it from
walking anywhere.  It works fine there, and never skips.  I've lost one
of those puppies from the trunk of a car, so it's easily removeable,
plus I'm able to still use it in the car.  The cable is routed underneath
the carpet, tucked under the swivel on the left side (it clears easily)
and can be hidden in the storage box underneath the seat when not
in use.
