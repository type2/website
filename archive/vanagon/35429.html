Subject: Re: VW on PBS!

&gt;        Mark J. just phoned me up (hey, almost past bedtime!!!) to tell me that
&gt;one of the local PBS stations is airing a show on the history of VW in the
&gt;U.S.  I set the VCR rolling (think I missed the first few minutes).
&gt;Anyway, the program is called &quot;Wheels.&quot;  Keep your eyes peeled for it!  I
&gt;had a quick peek at it... lots of great video footage from the '50s &amp; '60s.

        Sounds like the video that VWAG sends to you when you call. Anybody
know if they're the same?

Peace,
