&gt;the alternator in my 79 is about to die.  I have called around to get
&gt;price quotes on rebuilt ones.  Pep Boys has one with a lifetime
&gt;guarantee for $62.  It is not Bosch, though.  Another place has a
&gt;Bosch one for $131 plus $30 core charge.  I then called to get a quote
&gt;on a used one from a VW mechanic.  I told him about the Pep Boys
&gt;product and what it cost, and he basically screamed saying &quot;They
&gt;just keep breaking and cause harm to the fuel injection system.&quot;
&gt;Anybody have experience with the off brand alternators with a lifetime
&gt;warranty?

my alternator died on my 88 at about 100,000 or so, and i replaced it with
a $175 FLAPS Bosch-lookalike rebuilt by Beck-Arnley. it was identical to the
Bosch unit (being replaced) except that it had B-A stickers on it. so far,
so good. it also came with a lifetime warranty.

i think the vw mech is spouting sour grapes. :)  besides, if the Bosch one
is that cheap (even though it's twice the other one), go for it. :)

and if you'd REALLY like to feel good, call the vw dealer and ask for ...
(1) the price of a vw-rebuilt Bosch unit.
(2) the price of a NEW Bosch unit. &lt;be sitting down when you do this!!!&gt;
