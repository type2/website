&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i was wondering...doing my rebuild my friend sean noticed that my crankcase
&gt;has been welded in the past...and we suspect this is were my mystery oil 
&gt;leak was coming from.
&gt;
&gt;earlier i was thinking about just replacing it...i can get one for $250 
&gt;and this would come with the bottom end also...but Bob Hoover suggested 
&gt;that the aluminum cases can be welded and rewelded. i respect bob's 
&gt;advice and it's helped me on more then one occassion. i'd like to hear 
&gt;what others have done in the past...just to get an overview of the whole 
&gt;deal. i'm leaning towards welding...but i want to do this right since i'm 
&gt;dropping a buttload of money into the van..it's a keeper. :-)

Awhile back (79?) I bought an engine, don't remember the size, one of the
dog ears that mounted the oil cooler was broken. I took it to a shop and for
$25 it came out looking like new!
(I think '79 qualifies as &quot;awhile back&quot;.)
