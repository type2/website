Subject: Re: Carrying a canoe, Was: Re: Rain Gutter Adapter Locations


I once saw a Westy with extra latches installed on each side of the 
original one that holds the poptop down.  They were similar to what Jeeps 
use to hold their front hood down.  They were installed to prevent the 
top from flying open in case the main latch fails (with a load on top).  
I mounted false gutter mounts on my top for my Yakimas.  While I don't 
think the racks would ever come-off, I worried about the latch failing.  
However, I have had them for 3 years now, I carry up to 2 bikes and 4 
surfboards at once and have never noticed any strain on the system.  The 
latch still holds solid.  I have had the bikes up there with 40 mph 
crosswinds on the freeway (Wyoming plains).  I actually did remove the 
bikes this time, but because the poor van was having enough trouble as it 
was battling the wind.  
As long as one is confident of their craftsmanship, I think it would be a 
great idea to create a backup system for the main latch.  I would be 
interested in seeing your design idea.  Theirs nothing wrong with 
overkill (IMHO).  
Earlier, I think it was this thread, someone was concerned about drilling 
causing water leaks.  When installing the false gutters, I slathered them 
with silicone:  the plates, the fiberglass and the nuts and bolts.  I put 
enough in so that it oozed out the sides when I tightened the bolts.  It 
has been totally waterproof.  
I have always removed equipment when popping the top.  I know others pop 
it all the time with lots of gear up there and say they have experienced 
no problems.  I find that when I am driving to my destination (with toys 
on top) I usually sleep in the bottom.  I start using the top when I have 
arrived and unloaded.  I'm sure others would want access to the top at 
all times, and this is indeed a problem with this system.  But it works 
for me.  I am so sold on the Yakima system that I have accepted not using 
the top occasionally (or unloading when I must).  
Incidentally, my van's PO installed a tiedown on the front end, I think 
it was for a canoe.  It is a small boat tiedown (the kind where you wind 
the rope around it in a &quot;figure 8&quot;).  It is mounted directly above the 
center of my top radiator grill.  I use it as a clothesline tie-off.

&gt; For &quot;absolutely-no-drilling&quot; types you can carry a canoe on your
&gt; pop top Westy by tying it in the front and back and using canoe
&gt; carrying foam blocks. The blocks attach to the rim of the canoe.
&gt; 
&gt; So where to tie it in the back you may ask? The answer is: the rear
&gt; hatch. With the hatch open loop a line around each of the hinges.
&gt; Tie down the canoe rear between the hinges. (In the front use
&gt; the Westy luggage rack tiedowns of course)
&gt; 
&gt; About pop top mounted racks: I'm sceptic to mounting false
&gt; gutters on the front of the pop top. Consider that the only thing
&gt; holding the top down in the front on the late Westy's is the
&gt; center latch. Forces applied to the side of the top is going to
&gt; cause considerable bending tensions on the top.
&gt; 
&gt; However I do like the idea of having a rack wich allows the
&gt; pop to be popped even with a light load on. I have a design worked 
&gt; out where the side of the top is locked down to the gutter when
&gt; in transporting mode. Now I just need some time to go down to
&gt; the machine shop and make it.
