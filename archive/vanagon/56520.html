Subject: Re: Lighter tyres for lighter steering? 

This is good input from Helmut.

My experience is limited to passenger tires.

There may be one of two reasons for the light steering seen below:

  1) Change in tire brand.

  2) Tires with higher reinforcement probably have a narrower contact patch,
     thereby reduce required steering torque (most probable).

&gt;Lionel,
&gt;
&gt;I agree with that Michael wrote, but when I changed from the reinforced car
&gt;tyres 185SR14 Reinforced 94R from Michelin to light truck tyres 185R14 C6PR
&gt;I recognised a very lighter steering. I could not do hair spin corners with
&gt;one arm and Michelin, but with the light truck I can.
