     &gt;&gt;Wrecking yard is Clarkies in Saratoga.  Several Vgons there awaiting
     &gt;&gt;rescue.

What is avail up there? Any pop-top Vanagons? I will be visiting my
g-parents in Gloversville in the next month or so--maybe I can stop
for a visit!!


Sorry to reply to the whole list, but my mailer allows me to respond
to the sender only. Maybe people could always include their E-mail
adresses on messages for direct responses?...
