So martha rubin says:
&gt; Al Knoll reminded me of a few things I could add to the packing list
&gt; I posted a few days ago.  Here goes:
&gt; 
&gt; Each person should brng a 16.4 oz. propane bottle.  That's PER person.
&gt; Wood - fire/presto logs, scrap, kindling, regular wood, stuff you
                           ^^^^^
&gt;     find at the next door construction site, etc.  Bring as much as
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;     you can! - if Big Sur is an indication, we'll be needing LOTS.

Please DO NOT bring treated wood.  It ain't good for the lungs and if
inhaled can cause serious health problems.  It's toxic.  

Thanks,

Steven
