Subject: VW Stickers:  Gone in a flash!
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

Thanks to all for the overwhelming response!  I only had three, but due 
to the high interest I will try to procure a few more.  I should know 
within a week whether I can or not.. will keep all the requests and try 
to fulfill them.  I was going to have a contest to make it interesting 
(best reason why I should get a VW sticker)  but I didn't think there 
was such a demand.
  Best Regards!
Scott
