Subject: Crashworthiness of Vanagons?
Date: Thu, 7 Apr 94 19:01:18 CDT

Hi-

I just test drove an 86 Vanagon today.  I must say that I was amazed how
quiet, powerful, and otherwise well-behaved it seemed to me, compared to 
my old 77 Westfalia.  I am considering getting one of these vehicles sometime
soon, but I am wondering what the wisdom is regarding the ability of Vanagons
to keep their passengers healthy during a crash.  Other that going and looking
up old Consumer Reports ( which would tell me to go buy a new Honda Refrigerator
(TM)), I don't really no where to turn for this info.  Any help you can give
would be appreciated.

BTW, here's the deal on the Vanagon I tested:  115K, clean inside and very little
rust,  no records, but the clutch feels good, and it looks like there has been no
head work.  Also, it has a new water pump.  The place wants $3995, but I already
know that I could have it for $3100, or $2000 if I trade in my Audi Coupe (83,
with 135K).  How does this compare to deals you have gotten?

Thanks.
