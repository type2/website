Subject: strange commuter activities

I have a friend who had an aunt who used to read while she drove.  Somehow
the idea must have worked its magic on me subconsciously, because I now
confess to being guilty of same.  But I haven't done it for quite a while...

However, I still play the harmonica while driving.  On the last trip 
I even got my wife to play along on my old chord harmonica.
&quot;Silent Night&quot;,  it was a big hit.
