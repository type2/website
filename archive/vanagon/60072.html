Subject: 1:87 toy Vanagons, in cammo!

	A local hobby-shop, D &amp; J Hobbies, Campbell, is liquidating their 
Rocco slow-movers. They have a variety of 1:87 T3 (Vanagon) styles, all flat 
green or olive-drab. They also have multi-tone cammo, which may be Brekinas.
Also some school-bus size busses.

	 I saw a plain green 'syncro', an ambulance Vanagon w/ red gumball 
on roof, both in the $7 neighborhood. The multi-tone cammo set of single and 
double-cab pickups in fancy box is around original $20, or $10/each.
I believe the clearance discount is 50%, so their asking price is between 
$3.50 and $5. Sales tax is 8.25 or 8.5% round these parts.

All these have been around for a while, so the boxes may be a bit frayed.

	I'm willing to buy these for list-members and send them out.
Tell me what you want, I'll go buy it if I can, and if I do, I'll send
you a confirmation note with the exact price + tax and my outrageous
$1/bus profit. Flat rate $3 for shipping on top of that for domestic US.
You then send me a check.

	International, write me and we'll figure this out. 

	So of you want the flat-green Vanagon, it'll be $3.50 + 0.29 cents tax
+ $1 profit + $3 postage, or $7.79 delivered.

	I saw the four I've described, if there are another four in
the box, I could make $8 profit, which would cover the 'Follow-me' airport 
Vanagon, w/ orange and white checks over blue-grey, that I picked-up for 
myself :)

	You can always send your Aunt Minnie down if you don't like my mark up.

	Does anyone know of a 1:87 VW-Porsche 914 available for sale or trade?

	Bill
