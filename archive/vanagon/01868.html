Subject: van. parts!


While on a trip recently, I stopped through my hometown of Redding,
California in order to check out a business I saw advertising in
one of the VW magazines, namely, Bus Boys, Inc.  I put my name 
down for a copy of their catalogue, the second edition of
which is about to come from the printer ($4).  They specialize
in parts and accessories for VW bus AND vanagon.  On a quick
comparison of their prices, at least one item was the third
of the cost of same at the dealer - a rack for a westy
&quot;refirgerator,&quot; from them at around $22 or so, and over $60
at ULVWD (unfriendly local VW dealer?).  Another price comparison,
however didn't prove as favorable.  Still, they seem to have
gone to the trouble to procure parts and accessories from
the original source (even from places like Sweden for the
westy skylight, etc.), rather than to offer repros.  

Anyway, one of the two proprietors may even set up some sort
of computer BBS connection, which he does not have now.  I told
him I'd post this on the mailing-list in the meantime.  For those
of you who'd like to give a call, its:

Bus Boys, Inc.
18595 E. Lake Boulevard
Redding, CA  96003
1.800.792.BOYS
or
1.916.244.1616

Good luck, and let me know how it goes!

BTW&lt; they said they would soon be offering the rear insect
screen for a very reasonable price.  It currently retails at
the dealer for something like $165 or so.  Let's keep out
finger crossed!!!
