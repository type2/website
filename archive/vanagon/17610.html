Subject: RE: bus for mexico

 	i am planning to travel in mexico, central and south america in my
	74 camper, how's the availibility of engine parts for that
	year?  i am now making a list of things to buy for my trip
	if you have any suggestions please share!
	i am doing the following things

		1)i will try to buy as much oil before i leave the u.s.
		
		2)phase II tool kit
	
		3)talking on the internet about what makes a vw  tick
	
		also, i have only owned my vw for 7 months now and 
		haven't had any major problems, but i plan to take 
		about a month and check the brakes, steering, and 
		engine, (possibly remove it to fix that pesky
		oil leak).  

		this is my plan i hope it comes works out.

erm... maybe instead of talking on the internet about what makes a vw
tick you could take the engine out of it to see what makes it go and
then put it back together again better than it was before!!! Maybe do
some local cruises to see what you really need as opposed to what
you think you need. Good luck!!!
