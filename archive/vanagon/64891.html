&lt;&lt; Seems like there have been several e-mails about only using DOT4 in
Vanagon
 brake systems. The manual in my 1985 says to use DOT3 or DOT4. Anyone care
 to comment as I put DOT3 in mine. Did I screw up??? &gt;&gt;


no, you're fine..
there are not many cars that absolutely just HAVE to have DOT4, and the
Vanagon ain't one of them..
DOT3, DOT4, in the vanagon it makes no difference.
