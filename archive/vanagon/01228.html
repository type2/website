&gt;What I'd like to hear is some feedback on waterproofing the canvas in the pop
&gt;top.  The canvas on my van has started to let the rain soak in when the wind
&gt;blows, and I was thinking that I'd like to renew the waterproofing.  I think
&gt;that I'll go for the silicone stuff that I can buy in camping stores for dry 
&gt;(non-oiled) canvas tents.  Has anyone had any problems with this stuff, or 
&gt;have any better suggestions of what to do/use?

I think if you look closely, you'll find that the canvas was *never*
waterproofed at all.  Having camped for many years in a canvas tent, I
can assure you that waterproofing is not necessary.  Let me explain how
canvas keeps rain out... When canvas is dry, its fibers form a very,
very tight mesh. This is wonderful because the mesh allows air to flow through
and helps to keep your canvas tent cooler than if it were not breathable.
When canvas gets wet, the fibers swell up and close up the mesh structure,
preventing water from flowing through. Two things can happen to canvas to
prevent the swelling action from keeping water out: (1) if you press hard
on wet canvas, you will stretch it enough to reopen the mesh in an area so
water can flow through (this is the origin of the old story about not
touching the walls of a canvas tent while they're wet), and (2) if the
canvas gets soiled, especially with something oily or greasy, then the
swelling action will be impaired and water can seep through. Michael, I
think your best bet before doing anything is to clean the canvas with a
soapy water (use a mild soap like dishwashing detergent) and rinse very
throughly. If that doesn't work, then you could use some sort of water
proofing stuff, but beware that you'll now be inside a &quot;rubber tent&quot; and
it will get very hot in there unless the screen window is open and there's
a good breeze!  As for the &quot;dry&quot; versus &quot;oiled&quot; canvas tents, the &quot;dry&quot; ones
work as I described above and they do work well, although there is some
evidence that after many many years of heavy use, canvas will lose its
ability to swell enough to keep out water. I don't know if that's because
of the age of the canvas material or the dirt, grime, etc. it sees over
the years. An oiled canvas tent could be made out of any material since it's
the oil and not the natural swelling action that provides the water
repellency.

Hope this helps...
