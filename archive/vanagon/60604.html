Subject: Valve adjust??

Thanks to all for the replys.... after pulling valve cover and checking 
for loose parts/nuts/bolts.... discovered that the #4 ex valve lifter 
does not pump up.....Oooops!!!!  will try the using adding AFT to the oil 
and running until hot..... drain, change oil and filter..... this has 
worked before for me on another auto.....
Any other ideas???? Can the lifter be replaced with the motor in the van?
Peace, Love, and Tie-dye
Doc
