Subject: Advice on heads for '80 Westy


Hi,

I need advice on where to buy a head (preferrably new,
 reputable rebuilt OK) for an '80 vanagon (air cooled,
2 litters, square ports).  The valve seat on # 3 dropped,
 trashing the head and putting a big dent on the piston.
Should I replace the piston too? In that case, any suggestions
for places to buy a piston/ring set?

Thanks in advance for all suggestions.
