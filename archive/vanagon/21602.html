Subject: Windshield Seal Installs &amp; Slider Door Locks....

Fellow Bus Owners!  I have a '73 Sportsmobile Conversion that is in desperate
need of a new windshield seal.  While these are not outrageously expensive (I
will be getting a &quot;Cal-Look&quot; to save LOTS of bucks), I am a bit leery about
taking out that big ol' honkin' piece of glass and keeping it intact!  Any
points, tips, hints, or general foolishness you can pass my way on such a
procedure?

Now to the next dilemma.  My slider door lock has ceased to function.  I
remember it working nicely before the visit to the paint shop, alas,
something is now buggered.  Any clues?  The lock will not turn past about 1/2
rotation.  Is it possible when they put the handle back on somehow the
cylinder mechanism didn't mesh properly?  When it was stripped out, I didn't
much care (i.e. nothing to steal!), but I have spent blood, sweat, and bucks
making her pretty once again (as well as sounding nice with a new stereo) and
I would like to keep all this stuff mine!  Any info would help......

Also, I came across about 5 or 6 &quot;bay window&quot; busses and one early Vanagon in
a junk yard a week or so ago.  Unfortunately, they were rather picked
through.  Some glass and interior parts left.....if anyone needs anything, I
would be happy to check.  Thanks so much, volks......
