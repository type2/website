Subject: Coolant levels in refill tank

In hot weather, how high does your coolant level get to in the refill tank
when the engine is hot compared to its level when cold?

In the recent summer weather mine goes from just level with the max mark
when cold to half an inch above the bottom of the filler cap. It never used
to reach the cap. Is this normal?

The temperature needles shows a fraction hotter than usual, nothing
alarming.
