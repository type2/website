Subject: RE: Gasoline/Exhaust Smell Advice Needed

If Ron Van Ness' flapper boxes are rusted open, they are possibly also just
rusted, and thus act as big holes in the heater duct.  I would also want to
differentiate between a gas smell and an exhaust smell.  My most embarrassing
car moment was smelling a little fuel smell and leaving the car running while
I went to get a flashlight to diagnose it.  If I'd just waited by the car,
the flames gave enough light.  

Luckily this happened in the driveway; damage (68 VW convert.) was limited to
scorched engine lid and lots of rewiring.
