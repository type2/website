Hello all,
        I've decided to get the BFG's today as per Tom F's and several
other's on the list recomendation. Also I have installed the &quot;$100 vanagon
bogosity&quot; harness and will be traveling long distances this weekend giving
both new items telling roadtests. I will report my findings and/or opinions
next week.
