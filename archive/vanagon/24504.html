Subject: '87-No oil pressure!

Hello all,
I've had a bummer of a day! 50 miles from home, oil pressure light &amp; buzzer
go on, temperature normal.  I head for the freeway exit and by the time I got
to the end of the offramp the engine's making a klattering sound :_-(    I
turn off the engine and get a tow to the nearest VW dealer and left it there
with some instructions in the after hours envelope.  I'm expecting the worst
- like bent/ broken/ internal metal!
1. Do I have any hope that it might just be the oil pump or something short
of awful?
2. Does anyone have any experience with Freeway Lincoln Mercury Volkswagen in
San Bernardino, California?
