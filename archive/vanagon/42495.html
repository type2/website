Subject: 79 Westy for $800

Volks,
Noticed a 79 Westy in this AMs paper for $800.  The ad noted that it 
needs some engine work, but not what type.  In my hurry to get out this 
morning I neglected to bring the paper with me.  If someone wants info on 
this ASAP, let me know and I'll dial up the wifel unit for help.
The van is in Northern Colorado.
Jack
