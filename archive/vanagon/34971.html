&gt;NOTE:  VISA will not permit surcharges for using the card.

Also VISA &amp; MasterCard both do not permit merchants to require a minimum
purchase amount to use the card.  In fact a few merchants have had their
VISA/MC priviledges revoked by VISA and MasterCard because they would
not stop this practice.

How do I know this you ask?(Yeah like any really want to know)

I used to work for FirstUSA Bank, and the deal only with VISA and MC

To report a company you would first need to contact your credit card
provider to see if they will take any action, if not call VISA or
MasterCard, they both have 800 #'s so call 800-555-1212 to get them.
Tell them the name of the merchant, and if you can get the info the name
of the merchants bank, or merchants credit card service provider that
the they use.
