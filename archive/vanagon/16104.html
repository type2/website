Subject:      weakly stats ... he's after the Unknowns again!!

ok, folks. you'll have noticed on the Weakly Stats that the Unknowns
outnumber the Microbuses ... so all you newbies (since, oh, say, april 1st)
who want to be counted as a real bus of some sort, let me know.

say you don't have a bus right now? say you want one in the somewhat distant
future? Well, today is YOUR Lucky Day!!! YOU, too, can be a Wanabus!!! :)
that's someone who hasn't got a bus, but is semi-possibly-planning on getting
one (or another one, if a previous loved bus has fallen victim to the
ravages of time and/or OSD &lt;Other Stupid Drivers&gt;), well, you can sign up as
a Wanabus and remove the stigma and shame from being an Unknown.

after all, who knows what those Unknowns are driving!? &lt;the Shadow do!&gt;

and what if you don't fess up and tell me &lt;via direct mail. no need to
embarrass yourself in front of the whole list&gt;??

well, i might just resort to my old tactic of putting out a list of all those
Unknowns!!!! :)  or i might just send that list to the IRS. who knows what
they would do with it!

so, anyway, if you wanna be counted let me know. if not, whatever. ;)

joel
