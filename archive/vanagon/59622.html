Right on, Bill!   I'll be willing to help pay for any shortfall up to $100.
   I've gotten much more value than that out of the list (and it's
entertainment and a community, to boot.   What more could you ask? )

&gt;come as I get around to trying to put the engine back in my '81.  Came out
&gt;real easy, but getting it in is always harder...

&gt;&gt;I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt;&gt;purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt;&gt;cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a
T1.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt;&gt;host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
