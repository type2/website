Subject: Which fluids are best?

I'm going to change the oil in my '87 Syncro for the first time this weekend and 
I don't know what to put in.  I would like to find out from &quot;those in the know&quot; what the 
best weight and brand is to use.  The climate is the middle of the road around here, but 
I plan to do most of the heavy driving in the summers.
	While we are on the subject, What are your suggestions for:
		coolant, brake fluid, transmission, final drive, general greasing, CV 	
		joints, etc. ?
	I looked in the Vanagon list archives for this information and I'm either 
looking in the wrong places, or there isn't much there.  This would make a good FAQ file 
to join the others.  How about it Joel?
