Subject: Re: How do I lower my late model?

 
Probably the easiest and most effective way to lower a late-model bus is 
to drive it off a cliff. This is inexpensive, as you won't have to spend 
a lot on mods, and has the advantage of allowing the bus to die with 
dignity rather than whoring it all up with &quot;way rad&quot; vandalism.
