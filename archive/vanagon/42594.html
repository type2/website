&gt;&gt;I have a problem with the engine on my 85 Vanagon GL &quot;stumbling&quot; or
&gt;&gt;misfiring on an intermittent basis.  It usually misfires or bucks once or
&gt;&gt;twice and then runs fine for a while (10-20 minutes).  Other than this
&gt;&gt;problem the engine runs great.  (This van has 194000 miles, with about 15000
&gt;&gt;miles on a replacement, VW-remanufactured engine).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have tried to determine if it occurs under particular conditions (cold
&gt;&gt;engine, warm engine, cruising, accelerating, etc) but can't be sure.

&gt;&gt;Our 85 Westy did the same thing. Never figured it out. I hope someome does.

Could be facing the same problem I'm having right now. There's a head
temperature sender that screws into the head by cylinder #3. If that becomes
loose, or in my case the threads get stripped, the thing vibrates out the
the engine shuts down. It needs temp to feed to the computer to keep the
thing running. I'm now looking into ways to secure it back into the hole or
find a new place to put it. You might want to check it. It has a wire that
runs from it into the wiring harness. Check it to see if it's loose.
