I've been on the list for a week and can't believe the activity.  This is 
my first posting...
I am noticing a lot of concern about air heating techniques.  Personaly, 
I only experience these when traveling far from Tampa on the wrong 
seasons.  
I would like to sell my rear heating unit which I removed for space :] 
It should be more than perfect, It has been sitting for almost a year.  
Lasta time I used it was on that nameless storm a couple of years ago.  
It was helpful keeping me warm while fighting the violent crosswinds from 
Tampa to Washington...

Anyway, if you are interested, I'm sure we can negotiate!

Cheers

Fernando
