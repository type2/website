Subject: RE: VW Electrical contact enhancer

Another contact enhancer worth trying is &quot;ProGold&quot; by CAIG Laboratories. 
(http://www_dot_caig_dot_com/) It is arguably better than Stabilant 22 - at least it 
has better lubricating properties for moving contacts. (It should cure the 
&quot;Vanagon Misfire&quot; by cleaning the air meter contacts and treating them.) It is 
also used in high-end stereo gear.
