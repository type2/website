Subject: SOLAR BLOCK HEATER FOR DIESEL
Date: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 09:51:14 -0500

Hello out there -
	As a die hard diesel person I am on a quest for a solar powered block
heater.  I no longer work at a shop that I can utilize my standard 110v
block heater during the winter at work.  I plug in at home at night and
my diesel is a wonderful daily driver.  My VW diesel Rabbit (the Gray
Ghost) has started in -30 degree Fahrenheit in Northern Wisconsin (it
started but didn't like it). 
	I am hoping that any of the list servers have had contact with a solar
powered block heater or could pass on some words of wisdom.  Please let
me know.  
	Also, if any list member knows of a Westfalia in the 82-91 (wasserbox)
range in the Minnesota/Wisconsin/South-NorthDakota/Iowa/Illinois please
contact me directly.  I am looking for practically any Westy in the six
state area around Minnesota.

Thanks

Life is short.......Seize the day!
