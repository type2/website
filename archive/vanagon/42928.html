to keep this thread burning, as it were, a Warning to all you gasoline
vanagons with the water-cooled engines:

be very careful when replacing the air filter ... if you remove the bottom
part of the air filter box, you might pinch the injector wires when you
put the box back in. it doesn't take very long for those wires to abrade
through the insulation and short out the injection system to the chassis. :(

this tends to melt the wiring harness in the engine compartment, the fuel
injector relay and fuel pump relay, and generally ruin your day. to be safe,
you wind up replacing the brain and other modules (rather than try to figure
what got scorched and what didn't). using junkyard parts, my cost was $1200.

so be careful out there.

as an item of interest, some later 90-91 buses came with the injector wires
cable-tied out of the way ... so it was impossible for this to happen to
them. my 88 is cable-tied now. :)
