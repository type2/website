Great summary, but as as owner of one of the 87 1/2 Wolfsburgs, I gotta
disagree with:

&gt;The 1987-1/2 Wolfsburg Edition was the first Vanagon with the aero
&gt;styled urethane covered bumpers.  These bumpers are metalic grey  and
&gt;there are no matching rocker panels.  

Maybe they just slipped up for mine,  but there ain't any urethane
covering on the bumpers.  Even the black &quot;rubber strip&quot; on the front is
just paint.  As Uncle Joel said once, the bumpers are just targets.   I
think they make them out of polyester resin reinforced with clay.   I
bet they just took the buck from the car show right into production.
