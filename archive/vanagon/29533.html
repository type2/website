Geez, how'd your poor friend get stuck with one of those lousy westy 
tents?  They're not worth a thing, but I suppose I could take it off 
his/her hands to save the disposal fee at the dump (but only 'cause I'm 
such a nice guy!).  ;-)  ;-)
 
Seriously, I don't have any idea what they're worth here.
