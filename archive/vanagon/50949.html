&gt;Try using penetrating oil...WD40 is only a water displacer/lubricant.

No where on the can will you find the word&quot; lubricant&quot;. I mostly use it
for a cleaner/degreaser. Originally , or so I have heard, it was used as
arthritis medicine. Just spray it on the offending joint and the
penetrating properties quickly worked through the epidermis.
