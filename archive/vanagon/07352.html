&gt;&gt;...we all know diesels have a capacity for long engine 
life... 

&gt;...a common failure symptom of the diesel is blow-by...

My Transporter, a 1991 1.9L diesel T4 (as no doubt you all 
know), has completed its 102,000th mile today!  To say I'm 
feeling smug is an understatement.  The Tranny has never 
received any attention to the engine bar routine servicing and 
I am not one to be gentle on the go pedal. :)

(Joel said once that he didn't think Ireland was so big.  Well, 
it's not.  I like driving in circles!)

I have two questions.

1.  What is 'blow-by'?  Something Porsche 911s do on the 
outside lane? :)

2.  Has anyone experienced the continual wearing of the rubber 
bushing on the bottom of the front shock absorber on (bleccch) 
Eurovans?  My Tranny has gone through five front shock rubbers 
in 40,000 miles.  My 'friendly VW garage' informed me that VW 
do NOT supply the bushing as a separate item - only as part of 
a complete shock.  (And that WAS a complete shock.)

    The symptoms of dead bushings are a pronounced juddering of 
the (usually) front passenger-side wheel and an incredibly high 
wear rate on the shoulders of that tyre.  (Less than 500 miles 
before it's worn very noticably.)  When accelerating away, the 
Transporter pulls with an erratic shake that disappears 
quickly.

    As I mentioned once, a friend of mine with a similar '91 
Tranny has identical problems with his suspention.  In fact, 
the latest absorber in my van is one that was on his!  He 
bought new ones and I was 'given' the old ones by the garage.

Put on your thinking caps, people.  This is a strange and 
unique problem.

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
