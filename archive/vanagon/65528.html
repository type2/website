Subject:      1995 Eurovan Camper--also ...

In addition to the following questions, does anyone out their in vw land
know of special creative financing that one can get for the Eurovan Camper
(which would lead to lower than normal monthly payments)??  Thanks very
much for your responses.

Dale

I've discovered a used 1995 Eurovan Camper on a local lot: it has under
17,000 miles, appears to be perfect mechanically with a nearly perfect
body/interior.  Has stove, sink, refrig., auto windows and mirrors, auto
transmission, cassette stereo, cruise-control, curtains and blinds.

They are asking $27,000.  Is this a good price?  Is this a good year for
the Eurovan Camper?

Thanks
