&gt;So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;     Is there anything else *you'd* do if you had the engine out?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I don't know who the original poster was, but as long as the money is flowing
&gt;you may as well yank the gas tank out too and clean it out and if the gas
&gt;guage wasn't working properly, then this is the time to fix it.

Clean out the gas-tank reserve valve filter screen.  Much easier to get at
with the engine out...
