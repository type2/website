&gt; I discovered that most of the fluid was pouring down the filler tube and from 
&gt; there directly through to the ground below.  

I have an '84 that does the same thing.  I just assumed that the reservoir
was already full and that an overflow bypass was the culprit.  Wouldn't 
want to flood the carpet inside the cab.
