&quot;3.2 engine requires no modifications&quot; -- right, like cutting a map of 
downtown Boston into the foam of your engine lid, dremeling off all the
ribs from the top of the intake plenum, and buying a custom MSDS muffler
with about 1/3 the volume of the stock muffler is no modifications.  And
I didn't even have the nerve to READ the part where you modify the fuel
filler to get it past the oil tank.

Where's your spirit of &quot;it's not a bug, it's a feature'?  I LIKE having a
bulge in the middle of my engine lid.  It keeps grocery bags from falling
over.
