I've got an '89 and I've got all the manuals.  You really don't need them,
but I will be happy to send you what I've got.  I have no idea what
condition your westy is in, so I'm being overly cautious here.

This is what I'd do.

Visually check the tank's condition.  Apparently if these things are very
rusty, you can't get them filled.  Not really a problem here in Texas.

Check to see if there is any propane in the tank by cracking the &quot;fill
valve.&quot;  This valve is a small (between the finger and thumb) screw type
valve that is used to ensure that the tank is only 80% full.  If gas
escapes when you crack the valve open, you've got propane.

If so, check to ensure that the burners for the stove are turned OFF.  Then
open the larger valve on the tank so that propane will get to the stove.
Listen for hissing (you shouldn't hear much if the stove burners are off).
Go inside the camper and sniff around to see if you can smell gas.  If not,
light one of the burners on the stove to see if that works.

If not, go to a place that fills propane tanks and have it filled (should
hold about a buck's worth).  The fittings and the filling procedures are
pretty standard for any road-going propane tank, so I don't think that this
will be a problem.  Just be sure that they don't overfill the tank by
opening the &quot;fill valve&quot; while the attendant is filling.  When you see
liquid propane coming out the fill valve, it is full-close the &quot;fill valve.&quot;

I hope this is helpful.  I've never had any trouble using mine other than
filling it myself and getting in trouble with the people at the filling
station!

Hope this helps.

&gt;Hello fellow VDubbers.
&gt;
&gt;Need advice on testing propane unit on used Westy '89 so that we don't
&gt;torch it! No manuals. And the labels were scrubbed off the exterior unit.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you in advance for the favour of a reply.
