Subject:      Re: Recommendation for Vanagon Mechanic or Shop in Seattle Area ?

I use Louis Foreign Auto on Roosevelt. They are a small shop and seems
to always be busy so getting an appointment can be hard. They are,
however, highly recommended. Once when I had some bad noises coming out
of my van they told me they were booked up but to drop on by anyway.
When I did, they correctly diagnosed the problem and gave me the simple,
do it yourself solution.

You can reach them at 524-3366
