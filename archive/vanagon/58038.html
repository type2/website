Subject: Re: Table in an 87 Wolfsburg

Durby,

If you find out, please let me know!  My table won't stay down either. 
The spring is attached to a little metal piece behind the formed wall. 
There is a piece of sticky-backed velcro on the wall and remnates on the
table that appear to have been the PO's attempt to get it to stay down.

I've been meaning to ask my dealer about the required parts, but
wouldn't have the time to remedy it anyway.

TIA
Tonya
