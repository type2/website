  OFFICE MEMO          3 person middle bench                  Date:6/12/97

I have a '91 Vanagon Carat that we just outgrew with the arrival of our sixth
child.  I need to add another seat and I recall occasionally seeing Vanagon's
with a three person middle bench seat.  Can any of you kind Vanagon-loving
souls point my in a direction where I might find one of these benches?  I
refuse to trade in for a Suburban.
