Hi Mark,

My '86 Westy averaged about 20 mpg highway and my '91 Westy w/ automatic
gets around 18 to 19 mgh.  At first I was very reluctant about the
automatic  but I have been more than happy with it.  I think most list
members prefer the manual and I did for the last 25 years.   One thing
about a manual tranny is that you will have the expense for a new clutch, 
but if you change the oil in your auto it might out last the Vanagon.

Good Luck,

Charles Michaux
'91 Westy (33,000)

&gt; I am looking for a Vanagon 87-91 for my wife, she wants an automatic, I 
&gt; prefer manuals for ease of maintenance, power and mileage. Anyone have 
&gt; any raw figures on the difference on mileage on between an autoboxer and 
&gt; a manual tranny Vanagon in the 87 to 91 range? Any feedback appreciated.
&gt; Regards
