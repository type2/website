Subject:  Loose Sliding Door Handle               Ref:  

First - thanks to those of you that have responded with info and also pointed
me to the archives on this topic.

As a repayment, I would like to share what I learned with the list as it may
be of value to some of the rest of you at some time in the future.

The problem was a very loose and wobbly handle on the sliding door of my
Vanagon.  Access to remove the handle was obtained by : 1)  removing the screw
in the inside handle and removing the handle, 2)pop the interior panel off the
door to gain access to the latch box inside the door, 3)  By rotating/wiggling
the outside handle, locate the screw that goes into the shaft of the handle,
remove the screw and washer, and then pull the handle off from the outside. 
When I removed the handle, it became immediately clear that the reason was due
to material failure of the handle itself.

The handle is a die cast non-ferrous alloy, and has 3/8&quot; square steel shank
rigidly embedded in it that goes through the separate latch box mechanism in
the door.  Torque on the handle rotates the square shank which rotates the
mechanisms of the latch box.  The metal of the handle normally (from examining
the new handle, $75 !) holds the square shank firmly and rigidly.  Because of
the cracks in the handle where the steel shank is embedded, the shank was
loose and able to wobble quite a bit,  This showed up as wobble in the handle.
 The metal of the handle is definitely non-ferrous, and too heavy to be
aluminum (or I'd guess zinc either) which kind of led me to assume that a
welding repair was not an option.  So, for the afore mentioned $75 I purchased
a replacement handle.

The new handle came complete with lock cylinder and two keys.  Naturally, the
new lock was keyed differently than the original.  A close examination of the
cast metal that surrounds the lock cylinder located a small (1/16&quot; dia) hole
that had a dab of some blue colored &quot;paint&quot; over it.  After scraping and
picking away this &quot;paint&quot; I found a slotted screw, that I was able to remove
using a jeweler's screwdriver.  This screw anchors the lock cylinder.  I then
inserted the key and was able to remove the lock cylinder.  I repeated this on
the new handle, and swapped the lock cylinders so that the new handle now has
the old lock cylinder and will use the original key.  

Harvey
