Subject: Help: '89 Vanagon Stutters and Dies after Starting when Cold

Hi,
My '89 Vanagon cannot seem to find the right idle speed when the engine is
cold.  This is especially true when the A/C is on.  The idle speed varies
from 500 - 1200 while the brain is trying to find the proper settings and
the engine tends to stutter or stall on acceleration.

The problem disappears as soon as the engine warms up.

Any clues?
