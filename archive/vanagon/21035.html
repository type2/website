Subject: RE: oil temps 200what?

&gt;From: anon869_at_vt_dot_edu (Christopher Bridge):
&gt;hotter than the T1's.  If my 1600 went to over 220, I'd be real concerned.  
&gt;My personal opinion is that heat comes from poorly built engines.  Bad 

Here's a guy who obviously doesn't live in Arizona  ;-)  

I think hot engines come from it being a hundred and pi degrees outside.
My gauge is good too -- I walk outside when it's 110, turn the key, and
the gauge reads 110.  I have driven this car for 12 years now, and I 
regularly see 220 to 250F oil temps.  I got 70K out of my last engine,
and I don't think that is unusually short for a T2.  I don't think you 
can keep an air-cooled engine under 200F under these conditions, no matter
how well it's tuned or built.

Bob, do you have a sermon on engine temps?
