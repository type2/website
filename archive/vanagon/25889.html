Subject: Pulley pulling

I need to remove the triple pulley on my 1986 Vanagon to replace a leaking
crankshaft seal.  My Bentley manual (p 13.34-35) shows a VW tool #3149 which
holds the triple pulley while the bolt (under 258 ft lbs of torque) is
loosened.  Does anyone know if something simpler will work without doing
damage---maybe bolts or steel rod through the holes in the face of the
pulley braced on the engine block, or some tool I can get from a local parts
store??   I have removed crankshaft pulley bolts from other vehicles with
the transmission in gear and the brakes on, although none were tightened to
258 ft lbs.    

The manual (p 13.39) also shows a VW tool #3088 used to drive the new seal
into position.  This should not be necessary should it? 

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks
