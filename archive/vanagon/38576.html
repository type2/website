Subject: VW Bus Web Page Update

        Hi,

        I made some minor cosmetic changes to my web pages, and added a
pixture of Marc Heine's 195? panel, complete with rear hatch.  I though
those things were rare, but this is now the 3rd bus I've seen with one!
Wish I could put one in my deluxe...

        I also added a link to Stephen Fischer's Das Bus Haus Page
