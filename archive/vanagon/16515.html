The tally results are/were that a few people have already made their
reservations thru mistix for Bodega Dunes.  I plan to make mine
today.  The dates are June 2-4, meaning that you probably want to
reserve Friday and Saturday nites.  

The key here will be to make sure that as many as possible of us
get there as early as possible on Friday morning.  Mistix gives you
a reservation, but doesn't assign you a particular campsite number,
so we need to get in there early to pick the sites that suit us,
and get them as adjacent as possible.  As in the case of Big Sur,
and Red Rock, I believe that they allow 2 vehicles per site, so
planning in advance for doubling up will help.  It may also be
possible to fake something temporarily:  while Bradley Prunehead
and I were up there investigating sites, we learned that one might
be successful at getting two sites with one vehicle....if you can
arrange beforehead to have two adults in the car, plus one bicycle,
and one tent (the latter as a &quot;prop,&quot;), then probably one of the adults
can ride into the kiosk on the bike, carrying the tent, and get 
a space that way.

I STRONGLY URGE getting reservations, as we were told that these 
sites are very popular in weekends during this part of the season.  The
one thing we have in our favor is that school is not quite yet out
at that time, although that may be regional.  

Anyway, my suggestion is to call Mixtix - TODAY!  If anyone needs
further info, just e-mail me, or you're welcome to phone me
at 510/376.4321
