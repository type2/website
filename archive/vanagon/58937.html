First of all, NEVER let your bus know you are playing the lottery.  
It KNOWS that when you hit the big one, you're off to get the 
Tri-Star, or maybe the Westi Syncro, leaving it behind.  Be more 
secretive when buying those lottery tickets.

Similar problem, installed the ol' solenoid relay at the starter trick, no 
more problems.  Overheating of the starter, doesn't like to function, 
is one possiblity.

My '80 Westy is running great now with the exception of another bug that
has crept in....when the engine is hot after running for a while, if I
shut it off, run into the store and grab a lotto ticket, come back out,
it will not start and has difficulty in turning over at all. Let it sit
and cool down for 10 or 15 minutes and away she goes.
