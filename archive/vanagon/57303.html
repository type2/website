Hi volks...

The (orange) Prestone I've switched to is listed as 5/100 (!) - 5 years,
100k miles; states on the container that it is &quot;silicate and phosphate free;
add to any antifreeze including DEX-COOL&quot; (which is GM's in-house anti-freeze).

As an aside - I've been doing a long term coolant and power steering change
as follows;  every 3/4 thou I suck the pressure &amp; expansion tanks dry &amp;
refill them with new pre-mix (5/100 above - takes almost 1 gal. to fill both
tanks).  I realize I'll never attain 100% fresh coolant, but you never do
anyway with the 'factory' procedure, plus I never have to worry about
bleeding/bubbles/accidental overheating (&amp; I'm not concerned ref. flushing
as I wouldn't run caustic cleaners in any case).  As I wrote I've also been
doing the power steering the same way; first time I replaced the filter &amp;
O-ring, &amp; I've been using Valvoline semi-synthetic to refill the resevoir.
(sucker pumps are _at_ FLAPs for ~ $5-6).

Any comments - ie, am I doing something *really* stoopid; seems to be
working so far.....
