Hi Sean,

yes we take the US ..... Hi Hi!

I know from some friends, that the German Military (Bundeswehr) have
some drill camps for german pilots in the US. By the way, all Cars &amp;
Trucks from the Bundeswehr have a special licens plate Number, they
starts always with the letter Y  (for example Y-83467)

They are also on the Net: www.bundeswehr_dot_de, check it..
