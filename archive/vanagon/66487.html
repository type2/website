Subject:      Clutch hard to push in

I've noticed that for a hydraulic clutch, my Westy's clutch pedal is very
hard to push down. It is easily twice as hard as my VW bug with mechanical
clutch. My mechanic claims that this only means it is time to replace the
clutch. (104K miles) Does this seem reasonable?
