Subject: Re: 71 Westy that won't start

My 71 Westy wouldnt start a couple of weeks ago.  I tried everything ( tune
up, points, rotor, cap, plugs, cables, etc.) and nothing worked.  Finally I
tried starting fliud.  She fired right up and I have not had any problems
since, and not used any more starting fliud!
