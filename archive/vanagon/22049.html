Subject: RE: what about the VW Factory???



&gt;A friend of mine has heard of a company in SD that restores
&gt;and sells older breadloaves and campers called the VW Factory.
&gt;Has anyone dealt with these people? Are they on the up and up?



I heard of them, called them once to ask if they could repair
the rust under the windshield of my '71 bus. They were friendly,
polite, seemed knowledgable. They said, no, they didn't do outside
repair work, since all their time was taken up doing their
restorations for customers. You could bring your own bus for
restoration, or buy one of theirs turn-key.

They mentioned that they manufactured a panel to replace the
rusted out area under the windshield, but wouldn't sell me one,
since they needed them all for their own projects.

So, they are either super busy, or super paranoid about competition
from us shade-tree-mechanic types who do our own work. My first
(uninformed) guess is super-busy, since they said they had a 5-month
backlog.

My $0.02 worth...
