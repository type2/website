&gt;Where is Pastel White, Pastel Weib on the tags I think, I forget the

&gt;PS I don't believe the pop tops were ever painted, I agree with the
&gt;gell coat scenario, and working with fiberglass has been my business
&gt;(or rather my research) for a few years now.

Like, Rusty responds to John and stuff:
Hey John you're my man! If you have been doin' fiberglass for a few years
then (seriously) you are a few years of years ahead of me. This time only I
don't mean to be a smart**s. I don't know diddly about fiberglass/glassfibre
work. Maybe you can correctly clarify the differences between gel coating
and painting fiberglass surfaces.

Sorry, but I have no reference for the color that you mentioned. I think
that the list that I have seen mostly referenced the earlier vehicles. I'm
not doubting that this and other colors existed but I personnally don't have
any current knowledge of them. Here's the sh**, You brought it up so please
call the local paint supplier and find out about it. B.S. (I mean, negotiate
with) the proprietor for the formula and the L code. this way we all can
learn. I feel the ex-educator in me oozing out. OK everyone, write a 500
word report!!!!! Let's build a data base for the list!!
