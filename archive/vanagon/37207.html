Subject: 83 westy where to place bikes?

Hey All,
Having a fetish for expensive mountain bikes, I was wondering where all 
the other van/bike kooks place their bikes.  I was told that I can only 
carry 2 scooters on the roof.  Personally, I am in no hurry to cut holes 
into my fiberglass.  Someone else told me to place the bikes off the 
front.  I don't think the road crud would mix well with my bearings.  I 
would really like to place them inside somehow.  Any cool/cheap mounting 
methods without taking up the rear seat?  Input appreciated!
