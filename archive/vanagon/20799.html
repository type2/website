Subject: VWAG Customer Assistance Comes Thru...


We all know that VW's Customer Assistance in Wolfsburg will 
porvide information on the date of manufacture for &quot;older&quot;
VWs...but what about &quot;newer&quot; ones? Just for the hell of it
I sent in the VIN# for our EuroVan....and guess what, they
responded! My EV rolled off the line on August 4, 1992, and
was sent off to the US 10 days later.

The address:

Customer Assistance
Volkswagen AG
D-38426 Wolfsburg
Germany



BTW...its FREE!!! Allow about 3 to 4 weeks for a response. I just
spent $20 for Porsche to give me the same info on my wife's Porsche.
Its been 6 weeks and it still hasn't arrived.
