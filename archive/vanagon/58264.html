You want to subscribe to Lost Highways Quarterly, the Journal of Classic
Trailers and Motorhomes.  The magazine is wonderful and incredibly kitchy.
Even if you're not into old trailers, you'll like this magazine.

Send email to losthwys_at_libertynet_dot_org for more information, or call

p.s.  Martha, we're sooo much alike!
