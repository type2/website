&gt;This aint no cheesy server!

&gt;This aint no cheesy domain!
&gt;
&gt;This is an entire web hub..... an ALL VW HUB..... 24-7 all VW's, all the
&gt;time!

What the...  what exactly is a &quot;web hub&quot;?

&gt;Tired of being gouged by the minute?  VOLKSNET will be your answer!  One
&gt;monthly access fee with nationwide coverage!

Sounds good, as long as the price is reasonable (as in under $20/month for
unlimited 33K access and under $40/month for 64k)

&gt;Got your interest yet?  How about live tech sessions, direct satellite feed,
&gt;event coverage, road trip info &amp; stories, nationwide junkyard guide,  chat
&gt;rooms, tons of pictures, online catalogs, a free guide to other VW nuts on
&gt;the net, business &amp; shop reviews, video clips, even a game server, and much,
&gt;much more!!!!!

Those are some mighty strong goals.  Mind if I ask who is backing this?
Financially, I mean.

&gt;VOLKSNET is currently in the construction and test phase of its
&gt;incarnation.... We need your input!   What would you like to see on the
&gt;service?  What wouldn't you like to see?  ISDN vs. T1?  Let us know!!!!

If you are talking about running an internet service provider, I would like
to see a 1-800 access number, a shell account with a sizeable disk quota
(say 20 megs) and free web pages.  It would be nice if the shell account
was on a machine that was well stocked with software including compilers
and networking tools.  It would be nice if the 1-800 number had enough
modems hooked up to it that you would never get a busy signal.  This
doesn't currently exist, although some ISP's are getting close (no, not
AOL).

Good luck, and look me up when it's up and running.
