&gt; The West Coast is heading North, the East Coast is thinking of heading 
&gt; North.  If the rest of you want to meet in the middle I'm *still* toying 
&gt; with the idea of a Route 66 tour.  Maybe both coasts could meet in the 
&gt; middle.  Now where would that be?  Hmmmm... Oklahoma? New Mexico?  I 
&gt; guess that would be the middle of Route 66, but we could meet in 
&gt; Springfield, MO (the birthplace of Route 66) and then one of *my* 
&gt; Busses would be able to attend. ;-)

Along these lines may I suggest humbly, that a US 50, and Rt 66 tour
in a circle would be neat.  My SO did a 2.5 week WV to Colorado and
back partially for a wedding, partially to see the country this spring
and had great fun on 50, it goes coast to coast after all, there are
books about it, and its mostly the best sort of Bus road, 2 lane
blacktop.  Of course she did it in a eeeeekk Legacy wagon and tent, but
she clearly has bad taste as she puts up with me.
