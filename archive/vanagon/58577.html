&lt;&lt; &gt; well, if you got an '87 westy, and want to put a middle seat outta a 7
pass
 &gt;&gt; van into your westy, have you ever looked under the carpet mat in your
cargo
 &gt;&gt; floor?
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; you should have 2 filler strips in tracks in the formica floor, already
in
 &gt;&gt; there for this purpose. This is if you have a westy GL. (WWW's don't have
 &gt;&gt; this)
 &gt;&gt; Remove the filler strips, and slide in the seat.
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; It MUST be rocket science....

 &gt;Hey, two assholes in one day!  You and Tim must be those Siamese twins
 &gt;separated at birth.  Or maybe you're both just proof that late-term
 &gt;partial abortions are a bad thing.
 &gt;
 &gt;Yes I've lifted the fucking carpet and no there aren't any tracks;
 &gt;hence, the confusion you fucking assholes. &gt;&gt;

Well, now,  aren't we chipper!  :&lt;)
oh, and I do agree that LT abortions are a bad thing, but that's another
topic for another list...
you still haven't stated if you have a full westy or not. 
I know in '85, on the full GL westy's  there were the filler strips in tracks
in the floor. 
these filler strips were here for the very reason of sliding in a middle
seat. 
Now, I haven't looked under the carpet in a '87 or other year westy GL's
recently, but I don't see why it should be any different. 

please state if you have a westy GL or not. 

Oh, and by the way, you have a nice day!  :&lt;)
