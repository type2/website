Subject: Vanagon Floormats (was: front mat ?)

&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Does Wolfburg West produce Vanagon floormats?  If so, could I get contact info?
&gt;
&gt;Other suggestions?  I'd also like to cover the carpet between the front seats.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi All
&gt;
&gt;I just recieved a pair of floor mats for my Westy from Griot's Garage a
mail order place in Tacoma Wa. These mats are custom fit, and are made of
carpet. I am very impressed with the Quality. The catalog claims these are
mats that the Porsche Factory endorses. I didn't get the mat between the
seats, I don't know if they make them,although I think they might.
