Firstly, my power steering on my '87 westy is working again.  All I did was
accept the offer from T. Smith for the pages on the power steering from
Bently.  The day the pages arrived the power steering started to work
properly again !  Go figure.  So far I presume there was some blockage at
the relief valve which is in the pump or the valve was stuck open.
Whatever, it's working now.  Yesterday, I finally sprung for new tires,
Sears Superguard LT195/75R14.  $93.90 cnd each, $482.96 cnd total with
installation and taxes, ouch !  What a difference !  No more noise, no more
rumble, no more vibration,  now it rides like on a cloud !  So we'll see
how these babies hold up.  While I was out and about I saw three other
Vanagon westy's, two in the parking lot at Sears on Carlingwood and one at
Beaver Lumber in Bells Corners.  Any of you on the list ?  Now, if I can
just find a hubcap and a door for the electrical service outlet and a
fresh air vent for above the door and get my radio fixed and find a
million dollars I will be happy.

Cheers

Frank 
'87 Westy (never had a problem with the heads leaking as far as I know and
it's up to 150,000 km )
