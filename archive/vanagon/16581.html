I have a VW bus tent (came w/a 72 camper I think) Has been in basement
for years. Selling in garage sale this weekend if there is a taker.(dbout it)
If it does not sell, I will put it up for bids. I think everything is there.
Has tent, poles, netting. Looks big. Have not put it together. 
Am having yard sale so no time to deal with it.
