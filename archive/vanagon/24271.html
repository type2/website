Subject: JT's Magic Bus Project Update

In response to all the replies I received yesterday in regards to the 
cargo floor sections in my '66 MicroBus..

I did some more investigating on the Bus this morning.. it looks like it 
would be wise to replace the two floor halves, front crossmembers, and 
rocker panels.

Is this major work for a welder to do properly?  I know in a Bug it can 
be a pain in the ass to replace rockers and floors, but I have never done 
this on a Bus.

We have several VW Shoppes here in the Twin Cities area.  Should I use 
one of these to have it done or take it to a welding specialist?

Also, everyone keeps recommending &quot;Das Bulli Haus&quot; as the place to get 
repair panels.  Does anyone have the phone number?

Thanks!
