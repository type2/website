So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; A quick job?  A QUICK JOB?  Are you on glue?
&gt; 
&gt; It took about 1 year and a half or so!!!  And thats working every single
&gt; day on it for 9 of those months!  Towards the end I was working on it
&gt; seven days a week, 12-16 hours a day!

Thom, Matthew &amp; Jim (Van Bondo)

I certainly didn't mean to kick up the sand when I made my post.  I
guess I mis-calculated how much time you folks spent on your projects.
And if my calculations are correct, it'll now take me at least 3 years
to complete my project based on the input you guys gave me.  :[

Oh well.... lots of work to do.....

Cheers!
