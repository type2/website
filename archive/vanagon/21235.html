Subject: Front wheel bearings

There's been some additional road noise in my '87 Westy and I finally brought
it to the dealer to check out. They said the front passenger side wheel bearings
need to be replaced. They showed me how you can spin the wheel with one hand 
and hold on to a piece of the front end near the base of the spring with the 
other hand and feel a vibration. Only felt it on one side. 77K miles. Is this
unusual? They want $140 for parts and labor. This doesn't sound too unreasonable
to me. Is there anything else that should be done at the same time? Oh, the $140
covers the inner and outer bearings on the bad side.
