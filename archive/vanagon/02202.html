Subject: My bus trip results (1700 miles)

I just got back in town from my own semi-cross country bus trip, and am
interested by all this talk of a transporter trek. This sort of thing
has been going on for a while; it's all the hippies following the
Grateful Dead. On my trip, I saw hundreds of buses along my route to Washington
DC =&gt; Indianapolis Ind. There were lots of friendly people, and I helped a
couple of bus drivers with minor problems. We stayed at rest areas and
truck stops for free, and had a great time. 
     Also of interest, I averaged over 26 miles per gallon at around 55
mph in my '67 with a '68 beetle 1600 single port. Speed is something you
trip planners MUST consider. Us old-time bussers can't go much over 55,
and I like to stop every 100 or so miles to let the engine rest.
     Anyway, I had  a great time, and would love to do that sort of
thing next summer. Maybe we could schedule a stop or two where the Dead
are playing...
