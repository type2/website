Subject: What the German military is driving 

I have just returned from six weeks at White Sands Missle Range, where
I participated in the annual Roving Sands exercises.  A large contingent 
of Germans were invited this year.  As well as passing them on the Range,
I saw these guys playing tourist across the state.

In addition to the usual deuce-and-a-half (European version), they were
outfitted with Mercedes(!) and VW jeeps (sort of looked like a Thing
derivative, but likely water-cooled), and for personnel carriers they 
used Vanagons.  They were painted flat olive-drab, and may well have
been diesel (I never got close enough to tell).  They appeared to be
otherwise-stock vans.  No gun ports or missle racks  ;-)

All the US guys were driving hummers -- I think the Vanagon has a lot
more class.  Perhaps we should recommend the government save a few
bucks next time and buy VW.
