Driving into work today my '84 Vanagon experienced the &quot;bucking or jerking&quot;
as described in the following Technical Bulletin posted earlier by Joel:

	Technical Bulletin
	Group:     24
	Number:    92-01
	Date:      Feb. 29, 1992
	Subject:   Vanagon Intermittent Misfire
	Model(s):  All Vanagon Digifant Fuel Injection Engines
			       ^^^^^^^^
This is the wiring harness problem.  

One of Joel's past posts described the Vanagon fuel injection systems as such:

&quot;ok. the Digifant system was used on ALL 1986-1991 vanagons (on the 2.1 liter
engine). on the 1983-1985 1.9 liter engines, they called it Digijet. it's
supposed to be pretty much the same, but ...  it's also 'supposed' to be the
same as Bosch Motronic (on bmw's) but WITHOUT the knock sensor and timing
control. i don't know that for sure.&quot;

Does the wiring harness replacement (025 906 302) apply to the '83-'85 Digijet 
Vanagons?  The above information tends to suggest that it might but I would 
like to here of any first hand experience with this problem on the Digijet 
systems.

This is the first time I have experienced this problem in the 700+ miles
I have put on the van since I purchased it back in March.  It only lasted
a minute or two.  The previous owner described a similiar problem that he 
claims was fixed by finally replacing the ECU.
