Looking for parts for the above, need engine wiring, ECM, distributor, 
power steering and air conditioning hoses.  If you know of a source for 
this or anything else (van has been burnt in engine compartment), could 
you please reply direct to my brother at ads_at_north.nsis_dot_com or phone me 
at (902) 452-6346

Thanks for all your help!
