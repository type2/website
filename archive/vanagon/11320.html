Subject: Re: Sacrificial anode

I pissed my money down the toilet and bought a 4 anode set of that
&quot;Electronic Rust Inhibitor&quot; device advertised in JC Whitney. I think I paid,
like, $100+ for it. 

It doesn't operate through the principal of zink but it actually emits
electric current out into the metal of your car and is supposed to reduce
rusting. 

I know they use this technique for boats.

I big 3 automotive engineer tested these systems and pronounced them ineffecti
ve. He said your car would have to be sitting in a pool of salt water to get
any benefit. 

But driving around the northeast in wintertime is kind of like driving
through salt water, right? 

On the zinc front, why not just spray cans of those cold galvanizing sprays
all around under your van from time to time. This would distribute the zinc
all around instead of only at the few points that you could bolt a zinc
anode. Right?
