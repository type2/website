Subject:       cylinder leakage tester info wanted

Hello all you smart, good-looking people-

i would like to construct a cylinder leakage tester.  i believe i 
have all the parts but have a few questions.  if anyone knows what 
the heck i'm talking about, please communicate with me.  once i get 
one of the darn things built, i'll post instructions and usage notes.

ignorant but educable,
-dan

private email fine until i get this all sorted out.
