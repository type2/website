well......  i just dumped my synthetic out!!

I had been running 5-50 syn. in the van this summer and liked it 
(well, i think the engine liked it).  this winter i switched to 5-30 
syn for good cold weather starting and my crankshaft seal started 
leaking.  i drove it about a 1000 miles til it finally drove me crazy 
with worry of contaminating the clutch so i dumped it out and put in 
5-30 dino.  leak *seems* to have disappeared but i haven't taken it 
on a good jaunt to really warm it up.  we'll see.

I'm writing:

I have used 5-50 Castrol synthetic in my '85 Vanagon since I got it last
year with 124,000 miles on it.  I now have 143,000 miles on it and am
beginning to wonder if the only reason I have gotten this far is because of
the synthetic.  My Vanagon mechanic has always claimed that this particular
Vanagon &quot;feels weak&quot; compared to other Vanagons--and the only other one that
I have driven, an '84 with a relatively new engine, would indicate that he
is correct.  Mine is weak--but it uses no oil (unless the crankcase is
filling up with coolant to compensate for the loss of oil due to head leak).

I did notice this--when I had some cooling problems recently, I brought it
to said mechanic for dagnosis.  He cahnged the oil in it for me and used
10W40 Castrol (not synthetic).  My low RPM oil light flicker was the first
thing to return, no oil leaks though.  I just replaced that oil this weekend
with 5W50 Syntec and I can't make the engine idle low enough at hot
teperatures to make the oil light come on.

I suspect that the oil light flickering is an overreaction because of the
way Vanagons used to measure oil pressure (in only one place instead of two,
with a device that compares the two readings and asseses the condition).
Nevertheless, my oil pressure is higher with the Synthetic and I don't think
it's just because of the increased viscosity.

Since I can't seem to get the cooling system to ever bleed coolant properly
(I go through the procedure on a bi-weekly basis to bleed what air I can get
out of the system), I'll be running the Syntec until the thing drops. I have
decided only to invest in a new engine IF I can learn the secrets of
bleeding the cooling system (I would gladly pay $19.95 for the video of this
procedure since there is obviously something that I am still doing wrong--I
still have to resort to parking the van nose down on my neighbor's VERY
steep driveway just to get the thing completely filled with coolant since I
can get it to completely fill in no other way--certainly not with the front
end raised 40cm in the air).  BTW, the Alumaseal I dumped in the coolant
last month seems to have &quot;cured&quot; my left head leak.

As far as leaks caused by Synthetic oil, my past history is this: 8 years
and 145,000 miles in a 1985 VW Jetta that I used Mobil One in from the first
7,500 mile oil change (synthetic oil should not be used for break in oil
since it will prevent valves from &quot;seating&quot; properly).  The '85 Jetta
disintegrated physically around its perfect engine, never burned oil, only
leaked from the valve cover gasket once.  I also used synthetic in my 1992
Passat Wagon--this one used oil from the start, but never used any more than
1/2 quart in 3,000 miles.  The new owners of this car in Boston have kept in
touch with me--now at 65,000 miles, the Passat now seems to use no oil, but
leaks slightly from its horizontally mounted distributor--most VW 16V
engines seem to leak at this point, though.

I suspect that leaks with synthetic oil are anecdotal, the engine protection
characteristics of synthetics have sold me on the stuff, though!
