&gt; reason.  I too would like to know.  

The only time oil and gas can meet is through either the valves or
the rings (assuming the intake tract is working properly).  Assuming
the valve seals are in good shape, that only leaves the rings.  The
cylinder walls are lubricated by oil splashing and spraying on them
and at the same time (almost) they are exposed to combustion chamber
gasses.  I would guess that the amount of gasoline and additives that
ends up in the oil is directly proportional to the sealing capability
of the rings.  I would expect that an engine with worn rings would
dirty its oil almost immediately.  Has anyone experienced this?
