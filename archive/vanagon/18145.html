Subject: Non-Vanagon Sylvania H6054 headlamps available

	I've got a pair of brand new, never taken out of box, didn't really
fit the car they were bought for, Sylvania H6054 halogen headlamps.
	Can anyone use 'em? I believe they were correct for the early
A2 Golf.

	A lady friend of mine bought them for her Dodge Colt- the guy
at the store said they were correct, they weren't and she didn't have the
recipt or really remember which store they came from. I really hate this
story because my friend should have been looking out for herself better,
and the guy who sold them to her was so COMPLETELY wrong- her Colt took
replacable lamp/fixed reflector style, not sealed beams. 

	It would probably cost about $7 to send them somewhere,
or you could pick 'em up if you're in the bay area. They're marked
$16.99 each but canny shoppers could probably get 'em for about $11, or
less.

	Trade for a right-rear side marker for my '70 pickup? license
plate lamp bits and pieces (lens, bulb holder, bulb) for same? Toy
VWs or Porsche racers, or model airplanes? Maybe I give 'em to you
'cos you got a nice face... Anyway, getting 'em out of my garage would
be good for everyone.
