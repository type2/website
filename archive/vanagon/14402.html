&gt; I can only say that with all of this you will need a trailer and bus top

&gt; a shower.;-)....&quot;

Well!  First of all, if you have long hair, you'll feel the grunge,
too, if you have to go w/o the shower, and it becomes almost more
of a necessity, rather than a luxury.  

While it's true that camping is supposed to be &quot;simple,&quot; and adventurous,
etc., there is some common underlying theme in most of us here that
the person who dies with the most camping toys wins.  The name of
the game seems to be:  pretend you are stranded in the middle
of nowhere in the worst of conditions with 25 other fellow VW
bus/van people.  Which of us can survive not only the longest,
but in the most comfortable style!  After all, going on a vacation
doesn't have to be giving up conveniences, necessarily!   :)
