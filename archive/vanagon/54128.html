Subject: Rear heater core - solved

I can now confirm that the VW Polo heater core that I got from Euro Car
Parts for 35.25 UK pounds fits and works perfectly.

To recap, the Polo main heater core and the Caravelle rear heater core are
the same part. If you ask FLAPS in the UK for the Caravelle part they will
refer you to the VW factory - 98.70 UK pounds for the genuine article. Ask
instead for a Polo part.

I was offered a Polo heater by a breakers yard for 20 UK pounds, too small
a saving to forego the new part. BTW is the Polo as popular in the USA as
it is here?
