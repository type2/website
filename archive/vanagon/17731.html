&gt;Hi guys!  this talk about fridge fans has me really curious.

Harry,

Defender Industries (a boating supply house through mail order) has a
FridgeMate Ice Box Cooler.  The description is:  Runs on 2 D-cell batteries,
circulates air in refrigerator or ice box to eliminate hot spotes and arrest
spoilage.  3.4&quot; x 2.5&quot;.  Price is $13.95.

They also have a 12v refrigerator circular fan to cool off the evaporator
coils.  Price is $22.95.

Their number is 800-628-8225.  They charge no sales tax on orders going
outside of New York.  Order their catalog (free) since boating and VWs have
more in common than one might imagine.  For example, the marine wiring is
fully tinned and corrosion is kept to a minimum.
