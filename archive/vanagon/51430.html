Hey all,
OK, here's the situation:  '81 Westy, leaky propane knob on tank.  This
is the knob on the tank that you use to turn on the gas.  When this knob
is turned on, it leaks propane (loud hissing).  Obviously, this is
undesirable behavior.  I have obtained a rebuild kit from Ron Salmon for
this valve, now all I need to know is how the heck to do it.  How do I
get this valve apart?  Would it be easier to do if I remove the tank
from the van?  What should I do about the propane that's already in
there (I don't like venting it to the atmosphere, I can see someone
tossing a cigarette my way...)?  Do the propane fill places have the
capability to recover propane from a tank?  If anyone can give me
specific directions as to how to go about rebuilding this valve (I'm
having a very hard time visualizing it as I've never done anything like
this before) I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Sean
