Well, it went well.
We got the engine in by about 4:30 pm and started it up at about 6:20.
Turned it over a few times to get some oil in it and then... Vrooom.
First time.  What a thrill to hear it run after all this time seeing it
sit in the garage.  It clattered quite a bit, but by the time I went to
bed and parked it in the carport, it was sounding much better.
It's missing a little, but I'm going to transfer my Platinum plugs into it
and hopefully that'll solve that problem.  It's not serious. It sounds
REALLY smooth compared with the engine it replaced and I hope the clutch
will last longer than the last three have.

Lessons learned.
   Lift from the top. If you don't have the car lifted at all and you want
to pull the engine and you try to lift with a jack, then you won't be
able to get the engine out very easily. Lifting from the top, I could drop
it on the floor and slide it (on some wood peferably).  If I ever have to
do it again, I'll set something up that allows me to use my come-along
from the top. 
   Check ALL the hoses.  Forgot one; so when I went to fill it with water,
the water ran out the other end.  Ooops.
   
Other than that, everything went really smoothly.  I got a chance to
replace a bunch of questionable hoses and clamps.   The temperature gauge
is now reading something normal (right in the middle).  I know now that
it's easier to drop the engine to remove the clutch than it is to drop the
transmission.  (interesting fact, eh? -- I would never have guessed it.)
Can't think of anything to add except that the beer is great! :-)
