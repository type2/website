&gt;Power??  You havent seen underpowered until you try get a diesel
&gt;vanagon up a hill - 48 HP clak clak clak
&gt;Might have to so some work though - last tank only got 30 mpg

now THEM'S fighting words!!! ;)  the only way i can get 30 mpg is to lasso
the bumper of an 18-wheeler!!

well, actually, i have gotten 1200 mpg several times ... i have this little
driving computer in my 88 vanagon, and it 'counts' the pulses to one of the
injectors and uses that to calculate average AND instantaneous mpg. well,
the digifant fuel injection shuts the injectors OFF when you take your foot
off the pedal at speed ... like pulling into an off-ramp from the interestate.

if i have the computer set to instantaneous mpg, you ought to see that fuel
economy climb!! just imagine 50 mph at zero gallons per minute. :)  ...sigh.
only trouble is, it's 'instantaneous' mpg, not average for the whole tank.
best single tank average i ever got was 23 mpg, and that was because i was
following someone who refused to go over 55 mph in the rain ... in a honda. :)
