&gt; I am more than a little overwhelmed with the amount of mail I am recieving

I don't know what you're complaining about.  I went to Boston last week 
and left 300 messages in my inbox.  When I got back I had 1,037.  Took me 
until yesterday morning to clear them all out and there were 118 waiting 
for me when I got home tonight.
