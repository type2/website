Subject: O2 sensor

Does anyone know of a good (simple) way to check the O2 sensor. It is a 3
wire on an '87 syncro. I am trying to track down an erratic miss at idle. I
have changed the plugs, cap and rotor. I have checked the plug wires and
timing, played with the idle mixture and speed. It is giving me high hc
readings and will not pass CA smog regs. Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Derek
