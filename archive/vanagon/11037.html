Subject: Synchro trans leak
Date: Thu, 2 Feb 95 12:10:59 EST

On my 86 Synchro, I've replaced the seal around the drive shaft that
comes out of the transmission to the front differential.

I still have a leak from this seal. On my garage floor, I get about a
quarter sized drop once a week.

Anyone have any ideas why this seal continues to leak?
