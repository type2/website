I've noticed even non-vw people seem to view Vanagons differently: On 
our last backroads trip we were exploring the route between Shawnigan 
Lake and Jordan River. At a main intersection where I had stopped to 
check the map &amp; the view of a pristine river below, a BC Conservation 
truck came up &amp; asked if we were lost. I said, no I don't think so, 
this is the road to Jordan River, right? He looks kinda strange at 
me &amp; says: No, it goes to Sooke. I say, well isn't this the 
Jordan/Walker/Butler mainline intersection? Reply: Yes, but it goes to 
Sooke. Hmmm: ok, what if I wanted to get to Jordan River on the 
Jordan m/l? 'Oh, I guess you could try it, the roads kinda' rough 
though. As it turns out the road was *no* problem, and we were not 
lost.

Seems the sight of a newer Vanagon on a rough road is strange to 
many people still...

btw: We found having wildflowers stuck in a beer bottle in the dash 
increased the 'wave quotient' of our Vanagon dramatically. :)
(in case you haven't tried, a beer bottle fits nicely where the 
ashtray used to be..)
