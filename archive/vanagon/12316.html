&gt;Nice idea, but I have a real aversion to putting stickers on my car.  
&gt;However, I wouldn't mind hanging a piece of flannel on the antenna. ;)

I've got a 75 VW Westfalia that I want to hang a for sale sign on  (VBG)
---it was originally a greatful dead bus and still has the stickers so think
I will advertise it instead----it somehow seems like a 'sell out' to put a
sign on it...anyone know anyone looking for a great bus--will travel to
deliver it though I'm in KC area....beautiful bus---86000 miles, new GEX
balanced engine,new tires.....816-484-3481
