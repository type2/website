Subject: The `59 23-window...

If I get this, what I'll essentially have is a complete (minus middle
seat. :( ) `59 23-window. The body is one of the worst I've seen--
wheel wells cut out, window frames really rotten, turn signals `updated'
to `63-`67 style indicators, dash is falling apart due to the rust,
but the floors/rockers are actually pretty solid, given the rusty
condition of the rest of the bus. (ALL the window seals apparently went
bad, and weren't replaced in time. :( ) All in all, pretty unsalvageable
body. Now that I might have all these 23-window parts lying about,
what are your opinions on me getting just a 23-window body, and assembling
it from there? (I know they're rare, but someone here might have heard
of one lying about somewhere...)
