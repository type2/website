Subject: Re: Heated rear window on Vanagon

You need two wires, one supplies the power, the other is the ground. Yes it
is as simple as installing a switch and connection to the fuse box. The
second wire is the ground. You can ground it to the door itself, although
it is not a real good idea to send the current through the hinges, although
over the long haul it probably won't do squat. VW runs a second wire back
to the body and grounds it there.

&gt;The PO has left a heated rear window with one wire attached to the heating
&gt;elements. This wire disappears into the rear hatch. Would it be
&gt;straightforward to find it at the dashboard end and connect it to a switch
&gt;and a spare terminal on the fusebox? Or does it need two wires - there is
&gt;another connection to the heating elements at the other side, but there is
&gt;no hole in the rear hatch for a wire on that side.
