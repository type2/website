Subject: Testing Bosch O2 sensors.

The following is exerpted from an article that appeared in the June 
1995 issue of Motor Service.

[question was posed on testing the sensor]
Bosch offers a very straight forward procedure that begins with the 
sensor isolated from the computer.  Warm up the engine, disconnect 
the sensor's pigtail from the harness and attach it directly to your 
[digital] meter or tester.  To check rich response, hold 2,500 rpm 
and add propane to the intake (convenient hose and valve setups are 
available for this) until speed drops by 200 rpm.  Or, pull and plug 
the vacuum hose to the fuel pressure regulator, which will increase 
psi and richen the blend.  You should see the reading jump to .9V or 
more.  If reaction is slow, or that voltage is never reached, try 
running it at 3,000 rpm for a few minutes, then check again.  No 
improvement means you buy a new sensor.

Then, test lean response.  Introduce a small vacuum leak, say by 
removing an accessory hose, and watch the reading.  If it drops to 
.2V or lower in less than one second, the sensor's okay.  If it falls 
sluggishly, or you never see it get down to .2V, give it the 3,000 
rpm treatment and try again, but it's probably time for replacement.

Reconnect the pigtail to put the sensor back in touch with the 
system [ignition off], then tap your meter into the signal wire, 
maintain 1,500 rpm, and you should see rapidly changing reading that 
average somewhere around half a volt as the computer keeps adjusting 
the blend.  Deciding whether or not response is slow enough to 
justify replacement requires some judgement.  a common rule of thumb 
for minimum activity is eight trips across the rich/lean line in ten 
seconds, and sometimes you can find specs for cross-counts.
