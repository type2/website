Hi Ivan,
I recently replaced the starter on an 87 Syncro.  It is much easier on 
your 2WD.  If you drove for any length of time with the starter engaged I 
would think it would indeed be trashed....perhaps to the point of not 
bothering to rebuild it, as I did mine.  I would check with a few 
different shops on rebuilt starter prices...I got several widely varying 
estimates before I got mine off and decided to get it rebuilt.  You may 
need to get a new solenoid.  And I would check the ignition switch as 
well.

Good luck.

Sean

PS..the archives have good information on starter removal and the Bentley 
is straightforward.
