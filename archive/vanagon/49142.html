From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Will anyone be going on Thurs.?  I have both thurs &amp; fri. off and this is a 
&gt;long enough trip for me (Orange County) that leaving on fri. wouldn't leave 
&gt;much daylight.  I'd rather leave late morning instead of early a.m.
&gt;Also, anyone up for caravaning? or meeting somewhere along the way?

The reservations that I will be making Friday morning for the GROUP 
sites at Pumice Flat will be for Friday and Saturday night... but you 
could go ahead a camp in a regular family site in the valley Thursday 
night if you don't mind moving in the morning Friday. I'll go down in 
the valley in the afternoon on Thursday and hang some kind of signs to 
mark where we will be staying Fri and Sat. And will probably get down 
there pretty early on the 20th - to make sure things are groovey!
