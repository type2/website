Subject: ADVICE/OPINIONS interior

i have a 1975 deluxe westy. it is orange with original orange/green/black
plaid interior, including the original stool and storage box.  my last westy
(rest in peace) also had its original interior, 72 yellow vinyl, i
reappulstered (sp.?) it to a nice navy denim blue to go with the new forest
green paint job i gave her.
i dont love orange/green/black plaid, but it doesnt bother me as much as the
yellow vinyl job did.  should i change it? would this devalue, in the long
run, the value of the vehicle (seeing as the plaid is original, everywhere,
and in good condition)?
opinions and point of views please.

thanks,
avery
