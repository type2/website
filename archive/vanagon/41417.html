Subject: stereo stuff

So...

Having followed the thread on wiring the stereo to the switched leads and
hot coils etc, I re-wired my stereo today to the buzzer wire.  At about 5
min, it was one of the easiest tasks I've ever carried out--putting air in
the tires is a bigger pain in the butt.  I just found the relay, popped it
out, added a push in connector to the end of the stereo's power cord,
plugged it in, done.

Of course, now I can't roast wieners over my coil anymore...

Later, me and maggie are heading for the mountains for a week, where maybe
I'll learn to paddle...
