&gt;I'm a little worried.  I'm planning to get to BBTA, but I won't be 
&gt;leaving here until Friday the 26th, so we'll be getting there on the 27th
&gt;probably.  I would think this would really cut my chances of getting a 
&gt;camp spot during Memorial Day Weekend.  

I wouldn't be worried about that. I'm gonna call Bill Baumann (sp.?) as
soon as I find his number, just to make sure.

On the other hand, you might miss out on the &quot;scenic caravaning/picnic.&quot;

&gt;Also, do I have to send any kind of registration in advance for this 
&gt;thing?  I don't see any mention of it on the text of the flyer.  Is the 
&gt;$20 at the gate, or should I send them some money?

There's no pre-registration or reservation. Simply $20 at the gate.
