Subject: VW America denies recall

After loosing my '91 Westy with only 25,000 original miles on it - Mint
condition - to an engine fire this past Nov 15th, I read your Web Page
&quot;Vanagon Recall Information. In the following posting:

http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/recalls.html#1985-1991

1985 Vanagon through
1991 Vanagon                Built from 1985 Jul  to  1992 Jun
     Campaign 92V058001     No. Recalled: 340,000
     Campaign SF            Notification Date:
     System:                Fuel Lines.
     Vehicle Description:   Passenger Cars.
     Description of Defect: The fuel hose attached to the fuel
                            distribution rail on the engine may shrink
                            beyond the clamp force of the fuel hose
                            clamps, allowing fuel to leak.
     Consequence of Defect: Fuel leakage in the engine compartment can
                            cause an underhood fire if the fuel comes
                            in contact with a source of ignition.
     Corrective Action:     Replace the fuel hose attached to the fuel
                            rail and install a new spring type self-
                            tightening clamp.
                            NOTE: Volkswagen of America estimates the
                            new self-tightening fuel hose clamps will be
                            available in May of 1992.
     Supplement 92V058001   Information has been added to this campaign.

I called VW America on this. The person I spoke to took down all of the
information about my loss and said that they would research the matter
and get back to me.

When they did, a week or more later, they said &quot;there are no outstanding
recalls on that model.&quot; I replied that since this had been a 1992
recall, I could see that it might not be considered &quot;outstanding&quot; but
would like to have more details on the recall as it was made. They
denied that there had EVER been ANY recalls on the 1991 Westfalias. I
asked how it was possible to have a recall posted by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration and VW doesn't have any record of
it?

At that time I realized that I had hit a stone wall! I asked to speak to
someone higher up in the company and was told that there was no one
higher - all of customer service is at an equal level. Anotherwords,
&quot;this is the party line and we will not let you speak to any one else -
we're sorry you lost you van, but that's your problem.&quot;

I would like to know where the info on this Web page comes from. I have
tried to reach the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and
cannot seem to get a LIVE person. I really want to check this recall out
- as I am in the process of trying to buy a replacement Westy and REALLY
do not want to have the same problem.

I am VERY upset with VW America. I felt like they were really hiding
something - the wording of their response was very careful and not
exact. I also found that even though I had mailed in the &quot;change of
ownership&quot; form in the owners manual in April '95 - immediately after
buying the Westy, They still had the original owner in their database.
This, I was told, was because they didn't edit the database unless a the
owner called in with a problem. Well they have me in there now - but its
too late as my Westy is gone!

I am still fighting with the insurance company over the value and would
like to talk to someone at the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration about the &quot;truth&quot; on this recall.

Thankx-
