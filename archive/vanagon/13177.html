And you didn't let us Bay Area folks know?  Shame on you.

&gt; During the entire time, I did not see one Eurovan in California. I even looked for 
&gt; addresses in the Yellow Pages and drove past VW dealers, none there. I was up and 
&gt; down Highways (5, 80, 99, etc.). Saw plenty of vans (all types, colors, configurations, 
&gt; etc.); no Eurovans. Even saw a Vanagon (possibly '91) with ski racks mounted on the 
&gt; top and rear hatch, looked very good!!

Well, just last night I was behind a Eurovan GL.  It looked like it had a
rear hatch like the Vanagons, but my brother's '90 diesel T4 has double
rear doors.  The only reason that I can see we would seem to have less is,
we have plenty of old cars that are still good transportation.  So people
don't feel compelled to buy new ones.
