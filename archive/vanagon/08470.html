Subject: Re: Pizza in the Bay Area


	I'm blocked from 7:30 to 9:15 Tuesday night (20th), 6:45 to 9:15 
Wednesday night (21st), have Sunday and Monday (25th and 26th) plans

	So Thursday, Friday or Saturday the 22nd, 23rd or 24th
would be fine for me, maybe Tuesday the 27th.

	I can make lunch or dinner.

	I highly recommend Stuft Pizza on Castro in Mountain View,
Sue's Indian Cuisine across the street from it, La Fiesta down
Villa street, all kinds of places (some cheap!) on University Ave in 
Palo Alto ( Mango, Jing Jing, the ultra-groovy organic pizza place, 
Cafe Verona one block south on Hamilton, the Salvadorian place up
at the west end...)
	In the East Bay, lunch at C'es C'es Bon in Fremont
is excellent, in the French style and cheap.

	In short, there's plenty of good food available!
