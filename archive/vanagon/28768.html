Subject: synthetic tranny oil

I just changed the oil in my '87 syncro transmission (probably for the
first time since vehicle was new). I used a snythetic (Red Line MTX) and
I'm really happy with the result. It feels like I have a new transmission
now. I'm just curious if anyone on the list has experimented with synthetic
tranny oils. I'm also curious if there are any problems with mixing a
synthetic with petro-based oil as only 3 of the 5 liters can be drained (I
guess I could have tried to pump out the last 2 liters).

Thanks,
Mark McCulley
