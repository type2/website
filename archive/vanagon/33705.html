Subject: Re: Vanagon Hub caps


&gt;I don't know about the 'baby moon' hub caps of the pre-70s but
&gt;I have installed the 70's style chrome cap on my '86. These are
&gt;the flat ones, but I think it looks a lot better than the plastic 

I've got some baby moon hub caps on my '73. So if they fit a '73 and '73 hub
caps fit a Vanagon, they'll fit a Vanagon as well. The edge of the hub cap
doesn't sit in a recess like it does on the early rims, but its only a
couple of mm difference and they don't look out of place at all.
