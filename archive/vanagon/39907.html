I believe type 42 batteries are available in deep-cycle in European sizes,
which *do* fit the second battery compartment.

There are several routes available to you.  Some list members have installed
a second battery in this compartment which sticks up a few inches.  Remove
the cover door and make a replacement cover from a cooking pan.  It tends to
work pretty well.

You could install a battery under the bench seat.  Plenty of room.  You
might need venting, however.

My solution was to use a deep-cycle gel-cell battery made for wheelchairs.
It is very small and fits into the compartment, but only yields 30 or so
amp-hours.  Okay for my needs.
