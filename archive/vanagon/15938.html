Subject: Re: Re:Oil pressure was Tach was The Berg and springs

I have VDO electrical gauges for temperature and pressure.  The last thing
a VW needs is a long capillary tube running from the engine to the dash for
oil pressure - there are already more than enough places for oil to leak
out.
&gt;
&gt;While we are at the topic of gauges, has anyone installed a oil pressure
&gt;gauge with the 1/8&quot; plastic hose type sender?  I was wondering if it is
&gt;worth doing, with the long run.
&gt;
&gt;The other question is : is the oil pressure sender hole on the VW case
&gt;tapped 1/8&quot; npt?  Are we talking something strange?  I know that there are T
&gt;adapter out there, but I was wondering if I could go to my local hardware
&gt;store for one.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks all.
