Subject: Steering Wheels

Does anyone know what size hub fits on the Vanagon steering wheel post, and
what steering wheels from other vehicles would fit? The stock steering wheel
is too big for my tastes, and I thought it would be amusing to have a GTI or
911 steering wheel on my Vanagon. (I have a good imagination).

I tried fitting the stock steering wheel from my '76 Superbug, but the
Vanagon hub spline was too big.

Thanks!
