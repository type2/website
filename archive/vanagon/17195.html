&gt;Hi Everyone.  My a/c was leaking at the pulley end of the compressor, 

Hi Harry. 

The same thing happened with the compressor on my 90 syncro a few weeks ago
but as usual around here they don't try to fix anything, they just start
replacing components wildly, which is what they did and I got a new compressor.

But they had to give me a special, new, upgraded compressor because they
said VW has discontinued the compressor that came stock with the vehicle. 

My bill was nearly $1,000 but I only had to pay about $50 since I too am
under extended warranty.

Arn't warranties great!
