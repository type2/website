Subject: It's a mystery

Hello all,
I am stumped and I hope someone on this list can help me.  My problem is with
my 86 vanagon.  At start up the engine runs fine but deteriorates to a rough
idle after it is warmed up. I don't notice any problem while driving, only at
idle.  I found that if I disconnect the coolant temp sensor for the fuel
injection system (simulating a cold engine) it runs well.  So far, I have
replaced the spark plugs, wires, coil, cap, rotor,and oxygen sensor.  I have
tested other components of the FI system, all check out fine. Have any of you
experienced this problem with your vanagons?  Any help, comments, or advice
on solving this annoying little problem would be geatly appreciated.      

 

                                         Chris
