People have been talking a lot about 5 cylinder vanagons previously
about diesel to gas conversions.  I think people have missed the boat. 
I think A gas to Diesel conversion would make much more sense.  Does
anyone know how long of an engine will fit an the Vanagon engine bay.  I
have an 81 audi 5000 diesel which is slowly rusting away.  If I could
only find a vanagon to stuff it into.  Diesel vanagons are too slow for
some people, but I think a 65hp 5 cylinder would make a big difference.  

Diesels are more fun.  Below zero winter mornings aren't any fun with a
gasoline powered automobile.   Getting to buy fuel next to 18 wheelers
has a certain romantic appeal.  Slow speeds let you enjoy scenery more. 
You can always use Kerosene/Heating Oil in a pinch.  Diesels also have
lots of secret features.  
1.  Diesel cars don't explode as easily.
2.  If you get bored you can turn on the smoke screen feature by
retiming your injector pump.
3.  Fuel injection is 100% mechanical so you can repipe the intake and
exhaust and drive in up to 3 feet of water without risk of flooding your
distributor.  (CAUTION,  in high compression diesel engines, water in
the intake is bad...).
4.  Glow Plugs.
5.  Free oil slick in your driveway.  
etc...
