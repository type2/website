Subject: Hitches for EVs


Changed the subject line since I got surprised...  Having both Things and 
an EV it turns out I'd have read it anyway...

&gt; In reference to your question concerning a hitch for the EV,  I am in the
&gt; process of putting a 2&quot; receiver hitch on my EV-MV.  According to U-Haul they
&gt; list a 1&quot; and 2&quot; receiver type hitch for the EV.

What is the price and weight rating for these.  I've gotten quotes for 
about $200 and about $170 for a hitch rated to 3500# from VW dealers 
around here (Northern Virginia)  Says something like &quot;d'bar&quot; on them. The 
hitches bolt on with 6 bolts - no drilling and apparently no welding.  I 
happened to see an EV at the dealer that was in for service that had one 
of these hitches on it - the bolts seem to be longer bolts that reuse the 
holes that also hold on the bumper and such.

I'm not very knowledgeable on hitches (obviously) so what is a 'receiver 
type hitch'?  Is that the kind with an extractable piece that has the 
ball on it? (The dealer hitches are)
