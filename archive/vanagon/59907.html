Subject: can I ?

Got a spare tire  different from the rest with very little tread on it  
can I just drive around town without affecting the syncros 
I just need to drive maybe 25 miles     I  don't get new tires til friday 
Don't want to wreck the van    I saw the same tire tread warning 
but I need to use the van and have no choice with the spare
