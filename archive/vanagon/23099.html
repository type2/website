Subject: 12 Volt Power in the Shop



                    12 Volt Power in the Shop

An old car battery makes a fine 'power supply' for those
incidental 12vdc needs around the shop, such as checking a
headlamp.  As lead/acid batteries age the surface of their plates
becomes contaminated with lead sulphate, reducing their effective
discharge surface.  Such a battery may not be able to conjure up
enough amps to start your engine but it does perfectly well when
the task calls for a low-amperage discharge, such as seeing if
that rusty horn still works.

                        Keeping it Clean

Batteries aren't what you'd call user-friendly.  Old ones are
usually dirty and all of them have the habit of spitting acid on
you if you tip them over or, heaven forbid, drop one of the
things.  But dirty batteries can be cleaned, and a wooden box
well sealed with urethane enamel or varnish shrugs off a bit of
acid.

The best way to clean a battery is to start by wiping it down. 
And then keep wiping.  You may want to spritz a little 409 or
other detergent after you get most of the gunk off, but modern
battery cases are polypropylene and nothing sticks to them very
well.

If the terminals are corroded use a fiber-bristled brush to scrub
off the worst of it.  The corrosion products will eat up a steel
brush.  When you get down to metal, use one of those patent
battery terminal cleaners, the kind you twist down onto the
terminal, to scour off the last of the corrosion.  Wiping down
the terminals with a stiff solution of baking soda and water will
neutralize any acid remaining on or near the terminals, followed
by rinsing with fresh water.  But don't over-do it, with either
the soda or water.  Batteries usually corrode because the seal
between the battery case and the terminal has failed, allowing
electrolyte to be drawn out of the battery by evaporation and
capillary action.  If you flood the top of the battery with
baking soda solution it's liable to get into the battery and ruin
it.

It's always wise to assume that the terminals of an old battery
have failed seals.  One solution is to put acid neutralizing pads
about the base of the terminals.

                        Giving it a Home

Batteries like dark places.  I don't know why, they just do.  If
you want a happy battery, make it a box to live in.  Use solid
wood or plywood.  Don't use particle board or fried rice.  My
idea of a good battery box is one having a base made of 3/4&quot;
plywood with walls of 1/2&quot; ply and a tightly fitted lid with an
inner lip.  The box should be sealed with at least two coats of
high-gloss urethane varnish or enamel.  If you're poor, try
asphaltic emulsion, let it sit in the sun for a week, put on
another coat.  

To get power from the battery you'll need to put connectors on
the terminals, big connectors and cables if you're going to test
starters, little cables for lighter loads.  A weak battery will
still actuate the solenoid and spin a starter, assuming it's out
of the car and you've supported the shaft; VW starters have to be
in a fixture or bell housing to be tested since one end of the
shaft is supported by the bushing in the bell housing.

One trick for getting small amounts of power out of your battery
box is to use a pair of brass bolts through the case as external
connectors.  Dry wood is a good insulator if the potential is
only 12 volts so the bolts can go right in the wood, although
it's wise to soak the holes with varnish -- 'dry' wood contains
about 12% water by weight.  The farther apart you put the bolts,
the better.  Inside the battery box, the brass bolts are
connected to the battery terminals with wire.  If you don't have
regular battery connectors, just drill &amp; tap the terminals to
accept a coarse-thread bolt. I use 1/4-20 copper bolts (see how
to protect them below).

If you plan to store the battery outside and run the wires
through the wall, make your lid so it overlaps the box, sliding
down over the sides to act as a rain shield.  Won't don't run
uphill unless you push it.

Before you varnish the box, but after fitting the lid, use screws
and glue to attach a couple of husky 2x2 blocks across the ends
of the box as handles.  Batteries are heavy suckers.  It helps if
you can get a good grip on them.

                       Keeping it Charged

You can have a lot of fun here.  Some years ago I made up a
voltage sensing controller to turn a charger on or off according
to the battery voltage.  Cheap.  One IC, a couple of pots, a
transistor and a relay.  You can buy such things nowadays for
about what it costs to make one but if you like the smell of
solder let me know and I'll try and get the schematic up on the
web.  And of course, such a controller also works for solar
panels and the like.  Or for telling you to turn off the TV and
go to bed, if you're running the TV off the car's battery.

You can make a better battery charger than you can buy but it's
handiest to buy one.  Keep it near your shop battery.  Let the
controller do the on-off chores or just click it on when you
notice the battery getting low.

It takes at least 14 volts to push a charge into a 12 volt
battery.  Some chargers run as high as 18 volts, a bit too much. 
It's good to check to see exactly what your charger is putting
out.

                           Enjoying It

You've got a battery in a neat box, and some means of keeping it
charged.  So add a radio to your shop.  Whatever radio you happen
to have is usually good enough if you add a larger speaker but
you can use any sound system you can run in a car, which today
means some very sexy equipment.  Or a 12 volt TV set.  The
battery is already there, you may as well get some use out of it
between testing horns.  Or testing radios.

In fact, any 12 volt device you can run in your car can be run in
your shop, if you've got a reliable source of power.

Twelve volt direct current is pretty much a universal standard
today but lots of us have older, six volt vehicles.  Everything
I've said above still applies.  And you can even use a 12 volt
battery!  

A twelve volt battery has six cells, six volt has three.  The
cells are strapped together in series with lead-alloy straps
across the tops of the cells.  If your battery has a
polypropylene case, you can make out the straps if you position a
bright light against the battery case.  Once you know where they
are you can drill into them, tap them for a 1/4-20 bolt, and
pick-off 6 volt power from a 12 volt battery.  The bolt you want
to use is lead-plated steel or solder-covered copper.  You can
get 1/4-20 copper bolts in the electrical section of a good
hardware store (ask for grounding bolts).  Heat one gently while
keeping it slathered with soldering flux and flow solder all over
it.  Heat it a little more and shake off the excess solder then
chase the thread with a die once it cools.  You now have a bolt
that will shrug off acid, at least for a while.

Discharging half your battery will confuse the hell out of your
battery charger and cause the un-used cells to become over-
charged.  If you started with an old battery, this is probably an
acceptable compromise.  You can usually pick up a pretty good
battery used for about ten bucks.  Kept fully charged, reasonably
cool and not subjected to the vibration of a car, an old battery
can last five years or more.

                       Cheap 12 Volt Power

If you've ever tried to run something like a sound system using a
battery charger as a power supply you quickly discovered that a
battery charger is not a REGULATED supply.  They hum.  Loudly. 
But if you go shopping for a regulated 12 volt power supply
you'll find they run about $8/amp, more for little power
supplies, less for big ones.  Most automotive sound systems need
at least five or six amps, say fifty bucks.  Which is why the
battery-plus-charger makes good sense.  But howzabout this:  A
regulated seven amp regulated power supply for twenty-five bucks. 
Cheeep!

Alas, there are a couple of gotchas.  The power supply is a
switching power supply out of a computer; it may have a high-
frequency whine.  Computers don't mind the whine but sound
systems amplify it.  The other gotcha is that the output is 12
volts.  I mean, EXACTLY 12 volts.  Your automotive system is only
called a 12 volt system to be polite, it's actually a 13.6 volt
system or thereabouts.  The computer 12 volt supply may cause
your cassette to run a tad slow.

But I like the things.  They are light-weight, come with their
own fan, are very dependable and cost a lot less than their
transformer-based cousins.  American Science &amp; Surplus (ASS Co.,
(708) 982-0870) is offering such power supplies.  And if you
don't need it in the shop, it makes a handy spare for your
computer (Item #24082, $25.00)  They work fine with mobile ham
radio gear, which is designed to run on anything from about 11 to
15 volts.

                                                                 
                           Sermonette

Whenever the world has a bad-hair day, the lights go out. 
Earthquake, flood, hurricane or what-have-you, utility power is
one of the first things to go.  Most of us have a portable radio
around the house, maybe a few candles, and the power is never out
for very long...  we hope.  What if it's out for days?  

A fully charged car battery in the shop is a useful everyday tool
that can be a real comfort at times, possibly even a life-saver.
