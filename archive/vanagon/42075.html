&gt;&gt; Hello volks, and the usual to the point. My question is about Vanagon front
&gt;&gt; spoilers. Will a spoiler from later Vanagon fit an 82 model? Would major
&gt;&gt; modifications need to be made to install the part? Thanks!

&gt;Perhaps I'm thinkin' of somthing vastly different than what you're 
&gt;calling a spoiler... 
&gt;But does your vanagon really have good enough aerodynamics and go fast 
&gt;enough to cause lift?

I think he's talking about the ground effects skirt.
