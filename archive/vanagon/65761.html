Subject:      Overheating on '84 Vanagon

Got that dreaded call yesterday from my SO... &quot;the bus started
overheating in traffic, coolant was gushing out the back&quot;.

I checked all the archives on the new list server, but only found one
thread that dealt with a blown fuse, not the wiring of the fan
switches.

Then I checked the radiator fan, which worked when I applied a hot
lead. Then I checked the Bentley manual, which shows TWO
thermo-switches, one for a low speed circuit, one for a high speed. I
removed the front grill and found ONE thermo switch screwed into the
radiator, with three wires DANGLING in space (a red/white, a
red/black, and a red/blue), all with non-factory connectors. The
red/white comes up from behind the radiator, the red/black and red/blue
come from four wire to two wire gray connectors. The DPO strikes again!!

I tried several combinations of attaching these wires to the
thermo-switch, then jumpered the two connections and sometimes the fan
would come on, other times not, and other times, it would just stay on
even after removing the jumper!

I cannot for the life of me figure out how they hook up, why there are
three wires, nor can I find the second thermo-switch that is shown in
the Bentley wiring diagram.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
