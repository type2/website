On Tue, 22 Jul 1997 09:48:15 -0600 you said:
&gt;1 - the archives say to buy 8mm(5/16&quot;) hose.
&gt;I know my fuel filter takes 7mm hose.
&gt;How much of each?

on my 88 bus, the sizes were 7 (or 8) mm for the vast majority of the hoses.
i bought 25 feet. used about half of it. but i did have to redo one hose that
i cut too short ... do one hose at a time and make the new hose about one
inch longer than the old one. :)

the only hose that was different was the 10mm from the tank to the fuel
pump. i got three feet of it, and used only about 18&quot; of it.

&gt;2 - I also need to replace one of the Y fittings on top of my tank.
&gt;I am thinking about replacing all the hose up there too while i'm at it.
&gt;Is this a good idea?
&gt;Do I need clamps for this hose?
&gt;What size hose do I use for this?

i did ... replace all the engine hoses, that is. :)  i thought it was a
good idea. but be careful!! that &quot;ring&quot; of hoses around to the fuel injectors
and back to that &quot;Y&quot; has a lot of pressure. so be prepared for spraying fuel.
yes, get clamps. and it was the 7 (or 8) mm hose again.

&gt;3 - am I in for hell while doing this??

well ... no. not unless you make a spark or someone comes in with a lit
cigarette. :)  it's tedious and slow, but not &quot;hard&quot;. just take it slow
and easy, one hose at a time. and mop of the gasoline. and make DAMNED
sure you get ALL the rags away from the engine BEFORE you try to crank the
engine!!! :)  and be SURE to check ALL the clamps while the car is running
... and shut it off quick if you see a leak.

it took me about three hours of piddling, looking, fiddling, and doing the
replacement. the hardest ones to get to are the just-outside-the-engine-
compartment, behind the rear wheels. they are WAAAAAY up high and just almost
out of arm's reach from the ground. but go slow, and you can do it.

have a fire extinguisher handy.

good luck.
