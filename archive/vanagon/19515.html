&gt; &gt; &gt;I would like to be counted as someone else who suspects that
&gt; &gt; &gt;there is a racial element to the story. The description of
&gt; &gt; &gt;feeling righteous while vandalizing someone's car made me
&gt; &gt; &gt;very uncomfortable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      Well put -  Although I suspect the narrator meant no &quot;harm&quot;...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;The subtext of the story seemed to me to be one of &quot;getting
&gt; &gt; &gt;even with a black person with a bad attitude&quot;. That, to me,
&gt; &gt; &gt;is a racial issue.

&gt; While I won't defend the vandalization either, I wonder if you all would 
&gt; feel more comfortable if the black man in a caddy was replaced with a 
&gt; yuppie in a beemer or a bubba in a big ol 4x4? Would anyone rise to the 
&gt; defense of these much-maligned groups? 
&gt; But we're getting away from the point of this list, and the story, the 
&gt; narrator was reacting to someone dissing his VW because of what it was 
&gt; and I think we can all identify w/that.
&gt; nuff' said?

I'm actually VERY curious as to whether this story is literally true or 
what Ric 'wishes' he had done.
