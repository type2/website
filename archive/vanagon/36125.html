Subject: Re: The Tehachapi Run/milage

&gt;However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
&gt;submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
&gt;electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
&gt;on the word processor.

        Uhm, I *just* thought of something completely *revolutionary*!!
It's called the delete key! *Use it* if you don't want to read about Bob's
exploits-or mine, or anyone elses. And stop whining. As I recall, this list
is dedicated to Type II's, period. Part of owning a Type II is road
tripping, IMHO. I rest my case. Defense? (call that flame bait-BUT FLAME ME
PRIVATELY!!!)

        Fire up that ol' word prrocessor Bob!!! And damn the torpedoes!

Peace,
