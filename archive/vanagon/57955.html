I would suggest 215-70's.  Consider Dunlop Sport Rover GTX.  HR Speed rated, 
all season.  Available at Tire Rack for $68.00 ea. 50K tread wear warranty.

 I currently have 185 14's on my 87 Vanagon &amp; they are long overdue to be
 replaced.  
 1) Is it safe to switch to the 205/70 14's?  
 2) Will my steel rims be capable of holding the wider 205's?  
 3) Is it safer to stick with the 185's?
 
  &gt;&gt;

I had 185 14's on my 85 Westy and replaced them with 205/70's (the Yokohama
Y370's)

1)  &amp; 3)  I find that the handling was significantly better especially on
windy road &amp; high speed conditions.  I believe they are safe

2)  Mine have been on all winter.  No problem.

The only down side is that my gas mileage MAY have suffered as a result of
heavier tires.
