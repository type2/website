Subject: update on oil temp sender installation

Hey all,
Well, again, all replies to s_bartnik_at_wow_dot_com.  Everybody managed to do that
this last time except for one person :) .  

Well, I managed to locate a sump plate for my '78 in a junkyard, cost all of $3.
Not too bad I guess :) .  Many of you had suggested putting a bolt in the sump
plate to keep it from leaking.  Well, that's not a possible solution.  I'm not
speaking of the oil screen plate, I'm talking about the other one.  The
crankcase would have blocked any bolt I tried to put through.  I got a new sump
plate and have installed it but I will wait until I get back from my road trip
to install the sender.  I don't want to screw up again before my trip.  The good
thing, though, is that now I can use the screwed up plate to practice on and
possibly as a template when I decide to do it right :) .  

In other news, I finished the gauge installation into the dummy plate.  It went
really smoothly, although it did take a while to cut through that dummy plate
with the 2&quot; hole saw.  The gauge is supposed to be 2-1/16&quot; but the 2&quot; cut worked
PERFECTLY, that gauge just barely slid right into the hole.  couldn't ask for a
better cut.  The installation was pretty straightforward and easy, and I seem to
have light (I wired it thru the headlight switch so I can dim it) and it looks
really sharp.  Now, to make it functional.....

Thanks to everyone who replied to my urgent post for help.

Sean
