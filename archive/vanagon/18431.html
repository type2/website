&gt; Today; we went to fill up the BBQ and Westy propane tanks at Superior

&gt; problem was not the nozzle itself which was the right diameter and thread but
&gt; that the &quot;protector plate&quot; below the tank prevented the right &quot;angle of
&gt; attack&quot;. These are big nozzles used to fill up taxis. I have two questions.
&gt; a) has anyone else had this problem and b) does anyone in Ottawa know of
&gt; a place other than Superior that fills tanks? 
&gt; Thanks in advance.

I've had the same problem at gas stations (where the nozzle is designed
for &quot;propulsion propane&quot;. I have gotten quite fast at whipping off the
skid plate. At some RV places that sell propane, tha nozzle is a tad
longer and you can fill up without the pit crew.
