&gt; &gt; Dear VWers,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am considering to replace a panel on my 80 vanagon. This panel goes
&gt; &gt; from the roof to the bumper on the driver side nose of the car. It is
&gt; &gt; just left of the front left head light.
&gt;
&gt; Vahid, you are a brave one!  I don't have my Vanagon right
&gt; in front of me (won't fit in the office), but I think I
&gt; understand the piece you are talking about.  No, I have not
&gt; done anything similar, but it would seem to be a
&gt; particularly difficult area to work on because of all of the
&gt; pieces involved (under the dash and behind the nose).

I would agree.  Don't know how bad the original part is, but might this be
one of those cases where it is easier to weld in an entire front clip, like
I saw the guys at the Bus Stop (list members?, or list aware?) doing with a
barndoor several years ago?  You'd cut across the floor behind the door
pillars, and across the tops of the door pillars below the top (with the
windshield out).  You'd also replace the floor panel when done, so no welds
were exposed.  Idea is to have as few, and short, repair seams exposed as
possible.  The job requires *precise* measurements for fitting the new
clip, so that the windshield and doors fit and line up right.  Probably a
job for a professional shop.  Also, I would agree with and reiterate that
it would have to be pretty bad to do such major surgery.

Also, I've done some welding on sheet metal with a smoke wrench, which is
all I have, but I'd recommend a spark wrench instead.  Gas torches are
cooler and take longer to heat the work than spark torches, so warping of
broad, flat body panels (which buses have a &quot;corner&quot; on [aarrrgggghhh!]) is
a much more serious problem.
