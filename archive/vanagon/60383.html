        Reply to:   RE&gt;&gt;re. Bosch Platinums
re my original Bosch Platinum experiences and all the responses I've got.

ummmm.  Now you all have me thinking.  I've gotten several messages on how
well the BOSCH platinums have worked for other people.  

  My #005# motor is a stock '90 2.1 liter from my '90 Carat (rolled, Thanksgiving,
1995 - oops) and ran well then.  I did put Bosch platinums in it before the
roll over and don't remember what the life was.  Will have to check my
records.  I pulled the motor and dropped it into the current '89 Syncro.  With
two sets of the BOSCH Platinums now, I have had less than 15 K miles and 6
months to a year life.  

The only current problem is a consistent idle at 2000 rpm when weather is
cold.  (It get's that way here in Minnesota.)  However, this spring I noticed
that the high idle stayed once it warmed up.  No hunting or surging that I
recal, as noted in current threads I recall, just high idle around 2000 rpm.

Maybe once I get the front suspension rebuilt in the next week I better check
the motor.  Could be the high idle has progressed to something else that
trashes the Platinums?

oh, by the way, the wear pattern on the BOSCH platinums was the center
electrode wears down well below the level of the ceramic.

 The Platinum's corroded and wore so badly that after 6 months they were
 useless.  I'm really not sure why.  Both local Dealer (West Side VW) parts
 guys, and several other reputable contacts I know said stick with the stock
plug.  I'm now on stock plugs, and will see how they wear after a month or
two.  &gt;&gt;

Wow!!!  I'm shocked at the short life of your platinums.  Our 88 is on it's
third set now at over 120,000 miles.  I just put them in a few months ago
making over 50,000 miles for each of the first two sets.  Similar performance
in my 87.
