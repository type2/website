Subject: 87 Help AGAIN

Hi again.  Well, after 3 successfull trips, my vanagon decided to die
again.  Apparently the coolant temp. sensor didn't do the trick.

Latest:  Yesterday after returning from Baton Rouge, van had been
running the roads for about 4 hours, it kinda acted up.  Stopped at DMV
to turn in a license plate off Beetle, when I started the van back up,
it idled rough and didn't like me touching the gas.  I put it into drive
and let it coast for about 10-15 yards.  It then magically recovered and
operated normally all the way to the post office.  When I got back in
the van and started it back up, it did it again, and again recovered
after I put it in drive and coasted 10-15 yards.  This was with a warmed
up engine--guage had needle right over light where it normally is when
warm.  Behaved perfectly after each of these little episodes.

Today--Engine completely cold, start it up and it idles very rough. 
Actually it sounds good for about 2 seconds with rpm at 1000, drops rpms
nearly dies chugs chugs chugs shakes rattles &amp; rolls for 2-3 seconds,
back to smooth 100 rpm for 2 seconds, shake rattle &amp; roll, smooth, etc. 
Cycle continues until rpms drop too low and it kills.  If I step on gas,
it will increase rpms then shake rattle &amp; roll &amp; die.  Tried putting it
in gear and going up and down driveway to see if it would fix itself
like yesterday, but it wouldn't.

List of what has already been done:  NEW--temp. coolant sensor for FI,
O2 sensor, air intake sensor, air intake boot, ignition coil, rotor,
distributor cap, plug wires, vacuum lines, fuel pump, fuel filter, and
has the air intake sensor harness as per technical bulletin installed. 
I've checked all the wiring twice already, but am going to do that again
as well.

HELP!!!!!

Thanks everyone,
Tonya
