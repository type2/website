Subject: Re: Sweating W/O Air conditioning

You should be able to mount a typical RV air conditioner on the roof 
and run it from a generator mounted on a hitch type platform. Just 
run a fuel hose from in the engine compartment and route the power to 
the roof. The only limitation might be the angle of the Pop-top while 
up, the compressor might not like being slanted. I almost looked into 
this option but decided to camp in higher elevations as the summer 
heats up. However, I did see some interesting Redneck camping rigs 
last summer along the New River in VA. These people had a regular 
window unit stuck in a truck camper cover  with towels around it! I wondered 
why they did this cause it wasn't that hot, I found out after the sun 
went down, and the Jack Daniels came out, and the Rednecks got real 
loud. The air was to drown out the noise!
