All,

I am really a newbie with a red face! On another list I am on the replies 
all seem to come
from the individual writer and you have to cc the list.

When I started noticing individual replies to my first posts, I thought 
this list worked the same way. I apologize for copying the list as a 
whole when I got replies that were from individuals only. 

Please forgive one embarrassed newbie.
