Subject: Re: torque, rear brakes

	Oops- Jim Davis points out a flaw- what I *meant* to say was

&gt;So I measure 1.64 feet on my breaker bar and make a mark on the bar and
&gt;stand with one foot on each side of the line on the bar, and equalize 
&gt;my wieght.

	The point is to apply 238 lb,  1.64 feet down the breaker bar. 
That means the CENTER of the place the wieght is applied has to be 1.64
feet from the center of the socket drive.

	Bill
