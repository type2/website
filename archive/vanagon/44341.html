To All:

In preparation for my trip to Kansas City to deliver Bob Polys' engine, I
swung by the gas station this afternoon and took on 33 gallons of fuel,
$49.83.  The cashier became increasingly nervous as the numbers clicked up on
the pump.  When I was done she she said &quot;I didn't think Volkswagen's held
that much.&quot;

&quot;I have to go to Kansas City.&quot;

&quot;Oh....  &quot; looking very puzzled.

(I guess you had to be there :-)

-Bob
