Subject: Gas tank senders (`66 bus.)

I took the sender out of my bus last time I had the motor out. Cleaned it
up a bit, made sure everything slid up/down ok, and put it back in. It
still didn't work. (It didn't work before the `operation', so nothing
lost/nothing gained.) As I was coming back from a trip, I hit some bumps,
and the gas gauge needle started slamming itself back and forth in a 
suicidal fit, and then eventually calmed down. Now the gauge is stuck on
`full', which is hardly better than not working. It does go back to
empty when the key is turned off, however. I know I have about a 1/2 tank
(By mileage/distance traveled.) left.
