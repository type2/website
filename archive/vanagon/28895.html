Subject: Possible soundproofing alternative? (was: Seek and Ye Shall  Find...
 Foam!


&gt;Background:  I want to spray a 1&quot; layer of rigid urethane foam on Grendel's
&gt;ceiling, possibly other surfaces as well.
&gt;
&gt;Problem:  I couldn't find any spray foam in consumer-sized quantities.
   &lt;snip out some very useful stuff about spray foam&gt;

I once got some &quot;Spray Undercoating&quot; (don't remember the exact name,
sorry)-- some rubberized spray gunk designed to go on the bottom of your
car to rustproof it. I've heard mixed reviews-- it works, it doesn't work,
you can't get it off, it comes off too easily, it traps moisture, etc.

But-- once I sprayed it on the car in question (wasn't a VW), boy did
that car quiet down. Cheap, too-- two cans did the whole underside, total
cost around $10. It took a while to harden, but never dripped, never
expanded, just sat there.

I wonder if this stuff would work on the inside of the car? You know,
remove inside trim panels, spray the sheet metal you find there, let dry
a few days, replace the panels. Would it deaden the sound like my
application did to that car so many years ago? Would it release/continue
to release noxious fumes that would kill you dead, or explode when you
turned on the radio or whatever?

Anyone ever tried this? Any words of wisdom/warning/woe/wow?
