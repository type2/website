Subject: Early Vanagon: metal partition behind front seats?
Date: Sun, 29 Sep 1996 22:21:13 +0100

Hello,

In earlier Vanagons there is a metal partition just behind the front row of
seats. Later Vanagons seem to drop this so you can walk to the back.

Why was the partition there? Was it for structural strength/rigidity or was
it just to separate the front from the back? If the latter is there any
reason not to remove it?
