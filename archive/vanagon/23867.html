&gt;there is a book, Manifold Destiny, which is a cookbook about using the heat
&gt;from a car's engine/exhaust to cook meals. the book is available through

Which reminds me of an early episode in that English series &quot;The
Avengers.&quot; In a final scene, John Steed and Emma Peel stop their Bentley,
pop the hood, and there's their warm roastbeef picnic meal. Very
civilized. 

(Can't believe I still remember this! Must have been at least 20 years,
back in France, where the series was called &quot;chapeau melon et bottes de
cuir.&quot; Nothing to do with VWs, just that my infatuation with good food,
cars, and les nanas started very early on) ;-) 

Back to work.
