Subject: Bug Engine: Pros &amp; Cons?

    As you may recall, I am in the throes of impending overhaul syndrome, and
have a new decision to make. I have been offered a long block out of another
'71 Camper that rests behind a VW Dealership, with a history I do not know.
I'd probably just end up using the case and replacing the other parts.
    Well! My friend and yours (Ric), has offered up the engine from his '73
Super Beetle as a possible substitution! I have heard tid bits here and there
about this type of transplant, but I am wondering if you all might be able to
get more specific...
    What kind of modifications will we have to make?? I understand you need
some type of adapter...is this safe? easy? good? Also, is the engine from
that Beetle bigger than mine from my '71?? Will I have to switch other parts
over (i.e. generator, starter, etc...) to match it up??
    At least with this engine, I can be more positive about the history since
it belongs to a VW Guru, but I'd just like some more technical feedback
before I make the decision....
Thanks again!! Rach
