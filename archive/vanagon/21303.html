Subject: Re: Power Brake Booster 71 Bus


&gt;For replacing the godawfully expensive VW power brake vacuum hose,  Eugene
&gt;suggested neoprene hose as a cheaper alternative and someone said they used
&gt;heater hose with no ill collapsing effect.  I looked around at my FLAPS and
&gt;found out that 'round these parts the neoprene hose is special order.  Gates
&gt;makes a &quot;light duty&quot; 1/2&quot; or so inner diameter hose for $2.70/foot packaged
&gt;in 3 ft quantities.  You can buy larger quantities (over 3ft) cut to order
&gt;at only $1.75/foot.  It doesn't have the nice woven cover and wire wrapped
&gt;around it like the old VW stuff, but it is THICK and looks like it will do
&gt;the job.

BTW, I think I should clarify--this Gates stuff is vacuum hose--not heater
hose--and is specifically for power brake applications. It looks like heater
hose but is 2-3 times thicker.  It says &quot;light duty for cars and trucks&quot; on
the 3ft package.  I didn't ask to see the heavy duty stuff 'cause I think my
&quot;truck&quot; probably fits in the light duty catagory.
