&gt;Now for my questions:
&gt;
&gt;1.  The identification number on my engine indicates that it is an 
&gt;engine designed for a '76-'79 bus (2L FI).  Is there any way to 
&gt;tell if this is the exact original engine that came in my '77 
&gt;Westy?

The correct engine code for a '77 bus is &quot;GD.&quot;  This is 2 liter 
with solid lifters ('76/77).  &quot;GE&quot; would be 2 liter hydraulic 
lifters ('78/79).


&gt;2.  There is a mystery wire that screws into the head right next 
to the #3 cylinder FI connection to the head.  It replaces on of 
the screws that regularly holds the cooling tin in place?  It has a 
single wire coming out of it.  What is it? 

If it is just to the left of the #3 plug, it is the temperature 
sensor for the fuel injection.
