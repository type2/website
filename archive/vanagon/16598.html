Subject: Bosch 050 distributor

Hi-

Back on the list after a 7 month absence.  I have several questions that 
stem from my first. unexpected rebuild that I did back in Aug. on my '76 
breadbox.

I'll start with the easy one.  Has anyone used a Bosch 050 distributor?
Are they good for the Type IV engine?  How are they timed?  BTW- I am not 
the type to time by ear.  I need my strobe light!!

I will check the archives for any info that has been posted about this in 
the last year or two.

More questions to come.....
Jesse Reynolds
