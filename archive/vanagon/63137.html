Hey all,

I'm new here on the list, even I'm just born on last Friday.

I'm looking for a crazy camper within the next 18 years, when
I will get my drivers license. Does anyone save me his full
equipped Vanagon? I love the waterworld, I'm born in a wonderful
warm bath, but a missing a surf-board. The Vanagon must be capable
to carry a board on the roof, I do not want to miss one in future.

Does anyone have a solution for small drivers? I'm 55 cm tall
and my wight is near 4 kg. I decide to grow up fast, but, if
anyone have a solution, please e-mail my father given in the
mail header.

Will be nice to here from you.

Lars Zeidler
