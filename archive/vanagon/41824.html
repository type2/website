&gt;Sometimes the connection between my brain &amp; my brain isn't very reliable. :)
&gt;And I was beginning to think that it was just acceptable local Arkansas
&gt;punctuation.  :)
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't have noted it at all except as it appears in your message I
&gt;thought it might have been in a pre-made &quot;signature&quot; and as such likely to be
&gt;repeated with each message you sent.
&gt;
&gt;Do you ever take your Syncro off-road?
&gt;

Hi Jim
        The punctuation problem was in my &quot;signature&quot; It has been corrected. :-)
I have'nt done much off-road driving here in AR, hauling fence posts across
a pasture is about it.  I did do quite a bit of enviromentaly correct
off-roading in Alaska.  I ripped the E-brake cable off on one trip and
buried the van up to its belly on another.  The Syncro really is an off road
vehicle, regardless of what the hand book says.  
        What kind of tire wheel combination do you use?

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
