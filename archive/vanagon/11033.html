Subject: Pretour W., Buying a Vanagon in CA, &amp; Brake Fluid

Since I'm in digest mode, I'll take care of several items
in one post.

#1 - Someone from N. CA asked where Red Rock Canyon is.  It's
approx. 150 miles south of Mammoth/Bishop area (east side of
sierras).

#2 - If buying/wanting info on a car in S. CA, there is a # you
can call - 1-800-car-search.  They'll fax you a list of the
particular vehicle your interested in that are for sale in this
area (did I mention this before?).

#3 - Briake fluid is dripping from the small plate w/ two bolts
w/ a small tube thingy just above where the steering column goes
through the floor.  About one or two drops per day.  Could there
be something loose easily fixed/checked?  If so, how do get at it?
All looks fine up around the fluid reservor (sp?).

#4 - Also, a while back I asked about tinting Vanagon windows.  Well
I've done my research and am having it done this weekend.  I like
a survey for which is best way to go.
I've seen lots a vans with windows tinted but two ways really (I
think) look good:
a. a darker tint (75% grey) all windows except driver side and
   passenger side.  i.e. everything behind doors.
b. a medium tint  (60% grey) all windows.

Your input would be appreciated.
