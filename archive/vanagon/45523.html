&gt;
&gt;well ... i drove from Montgomery, AL to Lawrence, KS once ... in one fell
&gt;swoop. i think it was 19 hours. don't know how far it is, but it's a looooong
&gt;way across Kansas!
&gt;
Come on Joel!

Which way did you go?  I used to drive this from Atlanta to Lawrence in my
71 VW Bus when I was a student at the University of Kansas.  Can the 40
miles that Lawrence resides inside the Kansas border from KCMO feel that
long? :)  Now Lawrence to Goodland (Colorado state line) is another story
entirely!
