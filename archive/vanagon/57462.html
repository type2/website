Subject: Freon (R-12) to HF-134a on Vanagon A/C

Volks,
Has anyone converted their Vanagon A/C unit to HF-134a? If so does the
A/C unit cool as well as before? I have been instructed by my auto-A/C
man that the conversions are working well on most all types of
conversions, but that some vehicles with marginally small condensor
units do not cool the interior of the vehicles well enough with the less
efficient HF-134a in the system. Any feedback appreciated as I am
contemplating this conversion this coming -hot Texas- summer.
