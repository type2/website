Subject: FS - '83.5 Weekender GL
Date: Thu, 16 Jan 1997 15:41:23 -0500

Some good news, some bad news.

Brought home an '86 Weekender GL on Tuesday. It has power steering and an
auto tranny, making it much easier for my wife to drive. Good news.  That
leaves no more room for my trust daily driver, a '83.5 Weekender GL. I
tried to keep 'em both, but along with the '60 Westy and '68 Beetle
Convertible, no go :-(   Bad News.  So here's the dirt:

1983.5 Vanagon Weekender GL - For Sale
-$3,300 obo
-116,000 miles
-looks great, runs great
-1.9L, new head gaskets and no. 3 cylinder replaced in the Spring of '96
-4 spd manual tranny, all is fine but it does &quot;buck&quot; very slightly (per
recent string) when worked very hard, ie an hour or so in start and stop
traffic.
-A/C, works great, just charged over Summer of '96
-new metallic bronze/brown paint (non-vw color done by PO) in February of
'96, no rust, only body work done is a small spot behind the sliding door,
looks like a short pole was swiped.
-weekender interior with rear cushion installed from an '86 (all seats,
panels, etc.), folding rear seat/bed, split folding middle seat.
-kenwood am/fm cassette with kenwood speakers installed behind original
factory grill covers, could use a new antennae though, I think I tore the
cable during install and reception isn't great but the stereo sounds good.
-receiver type hitch rated at 3500 lbs( welded onto frame, not on the tow
hooks), I'd like to see someone even TRY and tow that amount!
-it still has the rear aux. heater and was working until this morning. I
just discovered the valve is very slowly leaking, but I'm going to try and
fix it before the sale.

This van is very clean and runs great. My wife and I have driven it
everywhere including &gt; 15 hours in one day with no problems. I've done my
very best to maintain it (with lots of help from the list!) and it's been
shown a lot of love. The ONLY reason I'm selling it is because of the 'new'
'86. My wife is a teacher and has to haul around students frequently, she's
simply too small to drive/park the '83 comfortably. I wish I had the
space/time/$$ to keep it but I don't :-(

Well, that's it! Now I have to post about repairs needed on the '86, here
we go again!
