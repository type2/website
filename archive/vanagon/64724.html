&lt;&lt; I don't own a multimeter, but your recent post has me considering such a
 purchase, provided they come with instructions that I could comprehend..
 Thanks,

Jim,

Anyone who can learn to spell the name of your town can learn to use a
multi-meter. I'd suggest one from the Radio-Nerd-Shack. The quality is good,
and the instructions are typically written by native English speakers, unique
amoung technical devices today.

ohms, amps, and volts,
