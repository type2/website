&gt;        LIMITED SLIP REAR END

 Maybe I lost something in the translation but....

 Correct me if I'm wrong but...installing this locking mechanism to the rear
differential does not a 4 wheel drive make, maybe a REAL 2 wheel drive or in
some other worlds also called positraction. My ex-Jeep had 2 differentials!

 If I made a mistake here, forgive me, I'm not that mechanically inclined
and trying to use the common sense that I never had in the first place.   :-(

 Wilma (1982 Westfalia) {1 wheel drive, as far as I know}
 Larson [maybe] (1956 Microbus) {same as up here}
