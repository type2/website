Hey all,
I want to thank everyone who contributed their CB advice.  A number of
folks, including Joel Walker and Mike White, recommended a
through-the-glass mount antenna.  Another fellow recommended a splitter
that would allow me to use my standard FM antenna as a CB antenna as
well.  Well, today I went around and checked my options.  I decided that
the best/easiest route was the glass-mount antenna.  

I got mine at Radio Shack (man they had a lot of antennas -- surprised I
didn't think to check them before).  It's a bit more than a foot long
with a cell-phone-type curlie in it (what do those curlies do anyway?)
and came with a 15-ft cable.  The coax was just long enough to reach my
CB radio.  The antenna adheres to the glass with a VERY STRONG adhesive.
In fact, it says to make sure it's where you want it because you can't
move it without damaging it.  Anyway, I hooked up the SWR meter and got
a good reading on it, road-tested it and it sounds good.  I mounted it
on the right rearmost side window so that most of my range is forward
and to the left.  

I also phoned my Dad and told him to ship me the spare alternator I have
(thanks for all the spare parts Rick!) just in case this one gives up
the ghost.  It's supposed to be near 40 F tomorrow so we'll see if this
noise is cold-related or not.

Thanks to all,
Sean
