Subject: (fwd) FS: mask/bra for VW Vannogon
From: Terrence Hurst &lt;terry.hurst_at_bentley_dot_com&gt;

For sale: Black, Bra/Mask for VW Vanagon one piece $100

It has Vanagon embrodered on the top section.  Protects and keeps bugs
out of the radiator with a nice sheer built in screen.

I had this on my '91 Vanagon, not sure what other years it will fit, I 
imagine that it should fit any Vanagon with square lights.  Used for 
less than one summer.

I will pay the shipping on this if you are interested.
