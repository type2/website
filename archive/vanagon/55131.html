Subject: RE: 87 Burning Oil 

Are you sure that you are putting in the right amount of oil?

This can happen if you put too much oil in crankcase.

&gt;Help please!
&gt;I have a 1987 2.1L which burns oil.  It only burns for about 3 or 4 seconds
&gt;and only happens at low rpm under stress (i.e. going up a hill).  When it
&gt;starts burning a big blue cloud, about the size of the van comes out, there
&gt;is also a metalic tapping noise, loud enough to be heard from the drivers
&gt;seat.  There is also a BIG loss of power.  The engine uses about 1 quart of
&gt;oil per 400 to 1000 miles, it varies greatlly.  This started recently, I
&gt;would say since it got cold.  Right now it's 0 deg. F outside and I am
&gt;using 10w40, changed oil about 100 miles ago.  The engine has about 6,000
&gt;miles on it, it's a factory rebuilt.  Does anyone have any idea's on what's
&gt;wrong?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
