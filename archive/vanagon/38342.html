Subject: Wilma has companion!

Veeple,

 The 1956 is finally in my possesion. Beautiful! Heaven! Etc., etc. I have
to thank &quot;thatvwguy_at_aol_dot_com&quot; for allowing me to buy the bus. Thanks, Dan. I
appreciate it very much. Now, like always, to the point.

 That was the point! I have to thank you people that had the patience to put
up with my unlimited amount of questions.

 What brand of vehicle paint is the best? Of course, considering that the
brand carries the VW colors that I would be looking for. Thanks in advance.

 In one of my last messages to the list I stated that the list was dead,
well, come to think of it, it was my brain. Apparently, I was kicked out of
the list (probably deserved it) and had to subscribe again. Sorry for the
comment!

 P.S. I need a name for the 56. Not Fred or Barnie nor Bam Bam, etc.
