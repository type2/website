Subject: Posts to print in newsletters.

Hi Volks,

    I've been reading everyone's comments about the post I made regarding
usings list posts in &quot;The Transporter', LiMBO's newsletter.  I didn't
intend to just take the postings without asking the author first.   I was
told that I should ask the list owner if I could use them.  I was under the
impression that the list owner had final say about what could be done with
the list posts.  I also posted the request to 'The List' so everyone would
know my intentions.  It was NEVER my intention to go behind everyones back
and publish posts from 'The List' in LiMBO's newsletter.  I and others
thought that it would be a great way to promote both LiMBO and 'The List'
and help bring both of these great organizations closer together.  I'm
sorry if I stirred up anyones emotions.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
