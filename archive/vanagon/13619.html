&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone put an air-dam on their Bus? I'm taking a long trip this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;summer and I'm trying to lower my gas mileage. There must be some type
                                ^^^^^
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of car with an air-dam that would bolt to the front bumper... Any 
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions?

Then, after a little chiding about anchors, parachutes, and bags of cement, he

&gt;  Very funny, compadres. But let us examine which of our cultures is
&gt; more 'on the ball', shall we. The term &quot;raising&quot; usually connotes something
&gt; 'better' or 'more adventageous'. So, if you say that 'lowering your
&gt; gas mileage' is good, then you're involved in a sort of oxymoronic
&gt; phrase, are you not? 

Mark, now I'm confused.  I thought that YOU said lowering your mileage was good.
In the U.S., lowering your mileage is a bad thing because it would mean getting 
fewer miles to the gallon.  But in Canada, lowering your mileage is a good thing
because you would be getting more litres to the 100 kilometres.  It's the 
Canadian system that is oxymoronic, n'est pas?
