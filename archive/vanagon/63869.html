I had this problem a while ago and it turned out to be nothing more than a
broken connection on the yellow lead in the driver's side door, and snap to
fix!

&gt;Mine does this too, but I just pulled the fuse and lock the locks in the
&gt;old fashioned way.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi all:   Has anyone had a problem with power locks as follows? If I
&gt;&gt; &gt; unlock the drivers door with a key, the lock opens then quickly relocks.
&gt;&gt; &gt; If I get the door open while unlocked the lock will just go up and down
&gt;&gt; &gt; until I close the door then it locks and stays. If I pull both front
&gt;&gt; &gt; door locks up at the same time, they will stay unlocked (and unlock the
&gt;&gt; &gt; rear doors as well) until one of them gets pushed down then they all
&gt;&gt; &gt; lock and it acts as I first described. The locks worked well until all
&gt;&gt; &gt; at once they started acting this way. I havn't a clue. Thought I'd ask
&gt;&gt; &gt; the list before I started pulling my hair out trying to figure out what
&gt;&gt; &gt; It's doing. Thanks
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi Todd,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This exact scenerio happened to my father-in-laws van.  It turned out to
&gt;&gt;be a
&gt;&gt; buggered power lock motor on the driver door.  He needed a new one.  One
&gt;&gt; question, does this same behavior happen when you open the passenger door
&gt;&gt; first???  If it doesn't, then it is the motor for sure.  This is the
&gt;&gt;third time
&gt;&gt; I have heard of this happening so I wonder if there was a bad run on
&gt;&gt;motors!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good Luck
&gt;&gt; Tony
