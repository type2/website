Subject: 89 Vanagon valve clatter

Yesterday I think I heard a little valve clattering, not sure.
everytime it was revved the clatter sped up along with the revs.it 
was an even clatter  sound, so im figuring it's the valves. The heads 
are both new(in Oct 95), not even 10,000 miles on em yet! Dealer 
installed them too! The temp never runs high, it runs really great...
the sound only showed up yesterday. I havent heard it anymore. I'm 
getting a tune up when that sweet tax return gets here; maybe that'll 
help it other wise yikes!
