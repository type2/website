Subject: engine swap

Hi folks,

My '84 waterboxer has blown the head gaskets for a second time with 140k on
it. I'm NOT gonna fix it again. Instead, I intend to install a fuel
injected Rabbit engine. Now I KNOW some of you gear-heads have done this. I
would really appreciate your stories or instructions, or advice, if you
would be so kind as to e-mail me directly.

A fellow gear-head,

yug
