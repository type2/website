Subject: Hi Speed Vanagoning

Hey, just because we drive under powered bricks doesn't mean we can't
zip down the freeway as fast as the rest of them.

I use the IFT method: I Follow Trucks

Not tailgating; that could get you a rock thru the winshield.  Also
remember a semi can stop a lot faster than a Vanagon.

Just follow at a reasonable, but close enough distance to pick up some
good drafting.

On a recent trip, I had a 6 wheeler (not the best) ahead of me to break
the cross wind (not good) 68 mph.  At the last of that leg I picked up a
tanker (good!), did 80 with lots of throttle left.  But a Saab 900 wants
in between us, who knows what he is thinking.  Finished off the leg
behind a semi doing 70-75 in the rain..  MPG = 19.2, not bad for an
automatic.  (Most of my cars are sticks, but with 140k on this and not
having to replace a clutch or throw out bearing is kind of nice!)

Doesn't always work out so nice.  Next leg thru Arkansas had a hard time
keeping up with my semi doing 76 over the hills.  Flattened out in the
east half of the state, but an Accura insisted on getting between us,
and then would fall back. 

I got around him once (flat out, 83 mph) but he muscled back in again. 
Why a low profile car bothers with drafting is beyond me.  I wouldn't.  
Anyway, only got 17.1 mpg on that leg.  

Ran the rest of the trip at speeds from 65 to 85.  Always had a power
reserve. Averaged about 19 mpg.  Not a bad way to go.
