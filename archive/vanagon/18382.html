&gt; Got drug to a Dead show last night and saw a guy selling t-shirts with the

I saw this on Spring tour in Charlotte NC

&gt; Didn't buy one out of various karmic concerns (ask and ye shall receive),
&gt; but looking at the state of the busses being driven by most Deadheads
&gt; (primarily extremely tired mid-70s campers, only saw one decent splittie),
&gt; it seemed spot on appropriate.

I agree about the karma, but I do have a VW/Grateful Dead tshirt that 
says&quot;FarFromMovin': If you've owned a Volkswagen you've experienced it&quot;.

But really Paul, everyone doesn't own busses to dump lots of money into 
them or do a full resoration - many still own them because they can 
maintain them themselves and they are great vehicles to live in

And there are many nice vans in the lot at Dead shows - I've got pictures 
to prove it!

Fukengroovin' !!
