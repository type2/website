Subject: shifter problems

re: transmission woes (owes?)

I am close to the end. 
recap:
-synch gear problems on 89 westie 79k miles old (grinds going to 3rd)
-researched and ordered a rebuilt trans
-had it installed (along with retrofits)
-while in the shop
  -replaced a water pump
  -replaced master brake cylinder and some lines.
cost $1010.00 for trans and $1000.00 for remove and replace and the
above work.

PROBLEMS:
	before I had the transmission replaced I made a last ditch effort to
adjusting the shifter linkages. BAD IDEA the bentley does a poor job on
this one folks. If you attempt this mark your starting point on the
front shifter rod where it connects to teh rear shifter. I thought about
doing it but decided against because of the grease and dirt. The manual
say &quot;loosen the clamp and make sure the rods can move back and
forth&quot;..easy enough, except if those rods have not been seperated in
years. When they finally came loose I almost pulled them apart I had no
idea where the starting point was! After I did this I took the van in to
replace the transmission. I had made it worse now I could not get into
1st. 3rd &amp; 4th was the only thing I could get. I explained this to the
mechanic so he could fix my mistake...When I got my van back I was in
the same boat. When I test drove it around the block I came right back
and pointed it out to the manager. It was closing time so I told him I
would bring it back after the holiday. Well I have being working on this
for the past two days, I figured I should be able to figure it out
(either that or cut the yard or something useful) well this is where I
am at...
-shifter will not go into reverse (because that is where 1st is)
-3rd and 4th occupy the position of 1st &amp; 2nd
-I actually have to push DOWN on the shifter to get into 1st.and 2nd.

-decided my shifter box is about 1/2&quot; to far to the driver side.
- I can go into ALL gears including reverse if I remove the shifter box 
    this is the current configuration.

It seems to be that to aleveate the problem I have to move the shifter
box 1/2&quot; to the drivers side. Or shorten the throw in the shifter
somehow.

I did this myself before I took it in to the shop, but for the life of
me I can not see how to get the adjustment that I need. I do not see how
the front and rear shift rod connection adjustment will mess up the
right/left throw of the shifter are there mysterios physics at work
here.
