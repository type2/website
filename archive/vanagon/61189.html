Subject: vanagon best year
Date: Tue, 10 Jun 1997 14:49:18 -0500

	I'm new to the vanagon scene and appeal to the knowledge of the list for
opinions and information about which year of vanagon to buy.My son owns a
78 westy and I  have borrowed it for a couple of vacations.My wife and I
think it is just great and we love using it ,so we have decided to buy a
vanagon westy.
	The list seems to have a lot of head gasket problems in the 2 weeks I've
been hanging  around.Is this a problem on all vanagons?We will take 1 or 2
long vacations a year 6k miles each and  some light towing, 1200lb bass
boat 3to 10 miles to various lakes.We live is humid southern Illinois so ac
is a must.
	I'm very comfortable with and enjoy working around engines and other
mechanical ,electronic fi and other electrical problems and situations.
	Thanks for any and all opinions and information that will help make my
quest sucessful.
