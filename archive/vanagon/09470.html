I'm very satisfied with Synthec 5-50 and would definitely not switch back
to Jurassic oil. Some have complained about synthetics creating leaks. But
wouldn't this indicate that synthetic oils do a better job of dissolving
all the crud and hence cleaning the engine from inside? 

Incidentally, during the first post-jurassic 3 or 4 oil changes, I found
waxy residue in that whatchamacallit oil sump plate/screen you're supposed
to clean at every other oil change or so. Made me feel good about all that
dirt being purged. 

I heard, maybe on this list, that the new oil leaks are often only
temporary. At first, after the deposits of those lesser oils have been
dissolved and evacuated, leaks start, but then, the synthetics actually
soak those dried-out seals which then expand and resume their job of
sealing. Hence the seals -- not the crud -- keep your engine from seeping.
