Subject: Re: Propane tank removal

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 	my propane tank is *very* rusty. I have to remove it from the 
&gt; Westy before I try to pass swiss vehicle inspection next week or they'll
&gt; fail me big time. It so happens that it's conveniently just out of propane.
&gt; Is it a difficult job to do to remove it? Are there things I have to be
&gt; particularly careful with? How can I cover up the connection nicely afterwards,
&gt; until I get another tank (or put back the old one at least for my 2 weeks
&gt; vacation in september). It has to look good because the inspection guys have
&gt; a nice well-lit pit from which they enjoy a full view of the underside of the
&gt; van.
&gt; 
Just did this on my '88. Removal is very easy - just disconnect the 2 
gas lines from the regulator after removing the 'skid plate' on the 
tank. Then loosen all 4 tank mounting nuts. Leave the inside 2 nuts 
on by a few threads, and remove the outer 2. The tank will then drop 
down, outer side first, then slide off the inner bolts. It is quite 
light when empty.

You will want to plug up the gas lines with a rubber plug or tape to 
keep dirt out.
