Subject: '87 Syncro????

Hi All, 

I may be getting an '87 Syncro tomorrow (if loan apps approved).  Got a
pretty good price for it from a FORD dealer (this wasn't Sergio's, I hope).
 I've only had loafs before, is there anything I should be looking for in
this that I would not find in the other, besides going more places?

Please let me know.

1987 (HOPEFULLY) Syncro

P.S.
Four wheel drive just means being able to get stuck in more inaccessable
places.
