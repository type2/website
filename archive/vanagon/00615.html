I have successfully fitted a Yakima rack to the top of my pop-top
('78 camper).  They sell these bolt on metal deals that emulate a piece
of standard rain gutter ('side mount' something they call them).
  I bolted them to the sides of the pop-top and
then a standard (NOT high tower) Yakima rack is attached.  Works great.

I have kayaks and I find that I can even pop the top with them on there:
I stand on the luggage rack in front of the pop-top and lift the boats
(taking stress off the hinges) while my wife inside the bus locks the
top-lifter arms in place!  Looks pretty weird (like a rocket launcher)
but seems fine on the hinges :)
