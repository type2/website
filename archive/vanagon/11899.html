&gt;&quot;Small Blue Thing&quot; - Suzanne Vega

Well spotted, Bill!  I must play it in the big blue thing!

&gt;And I, too, would rather be saved by a bag than zipped 
&gt;in one! The  latest Autoweek had something about the 
&gt;Sharran to the effect  that its built and priced for 
&gt;the european market (natch) and  would cost 
&gt;$35,000-$40,000 if they sold it here.
&gt;	No kidding- US dollars! 
&gt;	Pretty car though. What do they want for it in Ireland 
&gt;or the UK?

What's a Sharran?  I've been wielding the ALT-DEL combo rather 
heavily tonight!  If it's the Ford/VW MPV, as I think it could, 
I'll probably be drooling over it when it arrives. (VW version 
only, of course :)

As for prices, if the T4 kombi sells here for 24,000 pounds, 
the MPV will probably go for similar.  Ireland has ridiculous 
tax rates for cars.
