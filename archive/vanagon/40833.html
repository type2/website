Subject: syncros ( a lurker comes forth)

Hey Everybody-

I am looking for some common knowledge about syncros.

First, years of manufacture.  And US import.
Any oddities.  I think I noticed the fuel filler in a different spot, but 
maybe it depends on the vanagon year there.
Lastly, as I want to buy one before summer, any particularities to watch 
for.  I know all the rudiments, but the ones I've found are a little far 
out to ake to a reoutable VW shop, and they were at the only in the area.

And a question for all those in VT.  Does any one have the phone number 
to the People's Car Company in Westminster.  It would be appreciates.  
They had four vanagons (two syncros) and a very well beaten 65 21 window 
sunroof.

Thank you for any information

Tim
