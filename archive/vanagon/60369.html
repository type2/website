Subject: re &quot;Eurovan Can't Get Hitched&quot;

&gt;
&gt;We have a friend that needs a bike rack for a 1997 Eurovan for a cross
&gt;country trip.  He was told in Phoenix that his Eurovan could not have a
&gt;trailer hitch attached to it, so therefore they could not mount a bike rack.
&gt; He is not a Vanagon list member, so we thought we would help him out.  Any
&gt;suggestions.  Thanks.

He was told mistakenly. The EV is all set up for a hitch mount - it's
spec'ed for a smaller one though - 1.25 inch coupler instead of regular 2
inch size.
Many bike rack's come in this size as an option - I have a Hollywood which
folds down if you need to get into the hatch.
Only drawback I see to the hitch is that it makes getting the spare a bit
more awkward. (Which reminds me I need to actually do that for practice one
of these days!)
