Subject: Mcodes on line!

Well it had to happen sometime, and it has.  The infamous
M-code list, originally compiled (by David Easterwood, Tom Brouillette, 
Mary Smith, and others) for the NEATO newsletter, is now on my
web page:

http://www-personal.umich_dot_edu/~mjanello/mcodes.html

Find out that M55 is thermostatically controlled vent in deck lid (beetle),
stare in amazement at the phrase &quot;Visible location of reservoir,&quot;
and have hours of fun.

Can the paint code/interior swatch page be far off?
