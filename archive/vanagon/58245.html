&gt; &gt; &gt;I just replaced my skylight and actuator as well.  Got them both at
&gt; &gt; Euro-American (formerly Delta Six).
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm looking for the following used parts for my 86 Westfalia:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Skylight assembly (the original has has a corner cracked off and is now
&gt; &gt; &gt;covered in duct tape, and the nylon rollers have been chewed up)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Door latch assembly for one of the closets
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks
&gt;
