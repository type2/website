Subject: M-Codes Revisited


It was raining when I got home last night, so I thought I would do a
little research into the info on the VIN plate behind the right front
seat on the buses behind the house.

Whoever it was that asked me to email the M-codes to them so they can
set them up on a web page, ask again because I misplaced your address.
I have it in raw unsorted form for you, if you don't mind cleaning it
up.

I know Jim Bryant had a question about M-code 043, but I haven't found
out just what Swiss license requirements are yet.  As for the C42 code
for his 1967 Westy, I am positive it is some variation of the SO 42
Westy interior, although what variation I don't know.  Jim, if your
Westy is a walk-thru, I think 425 may be walk-thru seat belts, as that
was the common thread for my buses with that code.

Another common thread I found was in the paint/interior codes for
Westfalias.  For all Westys I have found from 64-68 the code is 523907,
although these don't match the actual paint/interior of pearl white/
mesh gray numbers, which are 131383.  Anybody out there have a Velvet
Green Westy?  What are your codes?

How about Port of Entry codes?  Anybody understand these? Does J=New
Jersey?  Y=New York?  H=New Hampshire T=Texas?  A=Alabama?  D=Delaware?

Anyone out there want to solve some option mysteries?  Anyone have
mysteries that need to be solved?

These are the buses I had access to &amp; codes I looked up last night...
