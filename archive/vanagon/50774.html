Subject: Golf/Jetta engine in gas Vanagon

Has anyone heard of a Golf/Jetta engine in a Synchro?  Can you bolt a
diesel bellhousing onto a synchro tranny?

Someone mentioned kits for putting other engines into a Vanagon.  I
think Subaru was one mentioned.  Any ideas where to get info?   

Has anyone tried turbocharging the 2.1?

I only have to drive 6 miles to work but there is a 2000 foot difference
in elevation and it is snowing outside again.  The synchro is slow
coming home but the Jetta is often slower, because I have to park it and
walk.
