Subject: Re: Bike Racks

&gt; Below is a summary of the information re bike racks that I received 
from

&gt; various interested and 

&gt; helpful listees.  Some of you who responded wanted to know what I found

&gt; out, so here it is.

&gt; 

&gt; Apparently the bike rack I was inquiring about is made by Paulchen.  It 
is

&gt; made in Germany; not 

&gt; imported to the US but is imported to Canada.  These racks cost in the 
$400

&gt; range, are available in 

&gt; a variety of configurations, and are sold by a number of dealers in the

&gt; Vancouver, BC area and by 

&gt; dealers in Ontario.  I heard from no one who actually has this rack but

&gt; several respondents would 

&gt; really like one.

 

Sorry to have missed the original posting and the opportunity to respond 
more promptly - I've been on sort of a 'Vanagon List' sabbatical.  I have 
one of the Paulchen racks, having been fortunate to pick up on a 
close-out special at one of the local Seattle area dealers (Carter VW) a 
couple of years ago.  They are a superb piece of equipment.  Very well 
designed (fit cleanly and closely to the rear hatch) and very well 
crafted.  Also extremely sturdy (rated I believe at about 160#).  They 
are actually a utility rack, with various optional accessory kits for 
carrying things like bikes, ski's, etc.  My closeout special included the 
bike and ski options, as well as the locking kit (locks the lower 
attachment screw to prevent the rack from being removed from the van).  I 
don't believe there are any still available locally.  They were quite 
expensive (about $400) and never sold very well.
