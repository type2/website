So Joel Walker says:
&gt; &gt;Anyway.  Your right.  Not everyone has access.  So will sell the books
&gt; &gt;at $100.00 a pop.  Sounds fair don't it? ;)  I thought so.  We could
&gt; 
&gt; nononononono. that's way too much. more like $20. if any costs at all.
&gt; which probably means it's not 'do-able'. but the point of my 'nagging
&gt; thoughts' was to do kinda what Muir did, but more specifically for buses:
&gt; get the info out to more people. spread it around.

I was JUST KIDDING!!!  I think making it as cheap as possible would 
increase the odds of vintage VWs being around for a lot longer than
it would be otherwise.
