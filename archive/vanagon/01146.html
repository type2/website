Subject: hello


Hello vanagon community:

It's good to see there are other brick-lovers on the net (as I suspected there
must be :-)

I've already enjoyed reading a few pieces of mail even before I could post
my first article, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest, too.

I do not know if there is a swap list somewhere, or if it is not appropriate
to post this here, but, I guess someone will correct me if it is not:

We currently have two bricks (a 93 EV and an 82 DIESEL camper).  I'd like to
upgrade the older one, preferably to an 88 or never MULTI-VAN.   Anyone know
of anyone who's selling one of these?  We're located in Bethlehem, PA, so the
location could be eastern PA, NJ, or Southeast NY.  If I cannot find a
multi-van, then I'd be interested in a Camper, too.

In the same line, does anyone know of anyone who's looking for an
82 DIESEL CAMPER ?  Please ask them to contact me if you do.
my number is: 610-868-5873
Thanks,
Cetin Seren
