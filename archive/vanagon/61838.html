Subject: RE: Aux. Battery 1980 westy


I haven't yet.  I got a few websites, but no luck.  I searched the 
archives, but found no info pertaining to my van.  There is a set of 
intructions that is fairly easy, that is if your van is wired for a 
second battery already.  All mine has is a black fuse holder and a clear 
plastic connector under the driver's seat.
