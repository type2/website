If you've got a tilt up rear door you've got the shower.

Carry a 5Gal Sunshower (tm) (Basic Designs) in the roof well or sunsoak it
when you get to your destination.  Then when comfortably esconced in the shower
spot, tilt up the door, use the ubiquitous Black Forest Organic Compression
Member to support the tiltie, put your sun shower on the tiltie, your towel
soap etc on the rear bumper et voila' shower time.  It helps to use a lid
from an actionpacker (tm) as a shower floor and Tevas (tm) as shower shoes.

So David, what format do you like the tifs,jpegs or gifs or whatever for the
page and I'll email a pic of the shower in use in the wilds of springtime
Oregon.  

For the bashful, a shower curtain can be simply made from clamps and a suitable
rectangle of material.

If you don't have the tilt up rear door just shower in the front with the SS on
the roof.  You may have to add a longer tube to the SS but that's easy.

The desert will give you plenty of hot, you just need to bring the water.

Full moon is Mar 17th, St. Patties day.  Desert in the full moon is ethereal,
hauntingly beautiful and worth the effort. 

BTW my A&amp;E 2000 awning works great in both winter and summer for a little bit
of shelter outside the brick.  Now part of Dometic the company makes Transawns
and other awnings somewhere in Colorado.  

The advantage is no guy lines, easy to put up and take down.  The disadvantage
is not wind stable, and 350 Frogskins.
