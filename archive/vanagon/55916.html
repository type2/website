Subject: 1980 Vans and color


Someone asked about the difference in the 80 and 81.  It made me wonder.  
I have a '80 Camper, and it is light blue.  There is another vanagon 
camper in town similar to mine and it is light blue too.  

I was wondering if their is a relationship between the year, model and 
color of the vans.  I realize that some have been pained.  

Anyone have any thoughts?
