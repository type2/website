Subject:      1987 vanagon

The engine in my '87 vanagon threw a rod and because I couldn't find a motor, I bought another '87. However, since the first vanagon is basically in very good condition, it is loaded with good parts. Some I will use. Some I would like to sell. If anyone needs things like a computer, steering rack, interior pieces, etc. please let me know at bbellm_at_neca_dot_com.
