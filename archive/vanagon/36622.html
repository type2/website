Greetings!

Anybody got quick n' easy way to test for a bad injector on an '82 Oil
Burner?  On a cold start Jake (The Oil Burner) lets out a large cloud of blue
smoke and runs rough.  After running a few minutes it clears up and warm he
runs fine.  I suspect a faulty injector, however, I don't have the special VW
tool that Bentley recommends for testing.
