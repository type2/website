I have Geico insurance for my rig (which, by the way, was $100 dollars
cheaper than any insurance I could find locally). They have a road
hazard addition to auto policies that covers towing, lockout, out of
gas, etc. and it is only $6 a year. Check it out. Their number is
800-841-3000 (24 hours a day).
