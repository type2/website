Subject: Re: VW oriented internet access provider


     VW OWNERS UNITE!!!!

     We don't NEED anyone SPAMMING the VW busfolk on the Internet!
     We don't NEED a VW oriented internet access provider!
     We do need good service from a PROFESSIONAL ISPs, and this sure
     does not sound like one!!!

     &gt;Tired of being gouged by the minute?
     Who is paying by the minute? A few of my fellow VW enthusiasts,
     but not most, and its simply a matter of CHOICE! The alternatives
     are ALREADY out there!!!!

     (Whoopsie, I see by the address that the spammer is one of those STILL
     paying by the minute!)

     &gt;Got your interest yet?
     Not at ALL!!!!

     &gt;How about live tech sessions, direct satellite
     &gt;feed, event coverage, road trip info &amp; stories,
     &gt;nationwide junkyard guide, chat rooms, tons of
     &gt;pictures, online catalogs, a free guide to
     &gt;other VW nuts on the net, business &amp; shop reviews,
     &gt;video clips, even a game server, and much, much more!!!!!
     I don't want direct satellite feed on my bus, just a HEATER!
     We already HAVE this other VW stuff on the World Wide Web, except
     for the VW game server. Instead we have Fridays, camping trips,
     M-code decypherment and SPAMMERS to entertain us!

     &gt;ISDN vs. T1? Let us know!!!!
     I want IDSN! You need at least T1...and the fact you don't
     KNOW is telling!!!!

     &lt;grin&gt; (Sorry, folks, I just couldn't resist!)
