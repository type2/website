&gt;&gt; Hello, I am a Vanagon fanatic and I belong to number of
&gt;&gt; organazations representing these vehicles.  The one complaint we all
&gt;&gt; have is the lack of power.  Has anyone ever considered a turbo kit
&gt;&gt; for the waterboxer engine?  It seems to me that this would be a
&gt;&gt; relatively easy instalation with good sales potential.  Most owners
&gt;&gt; would be ecstatic with say a 30% horsepwer improvement and the
&gt;&gt; Vanagon cooling system has plenty of reserve capacity.
&gt;&gt;  The low gearing of these vehcles would help to keep the turbo
&gt;&gt;  spining and
&gt;&gt; provididng boost for hill climbing and passing which is this
&gt;&gt; vehicles short fall. Please let me know what you think. Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Dennis Haynes

&gt;
&gt;sorry but we do not have the time or money to develop one. It would 
&gt;be a nice addition I agree!!

Everyone!!  Let this company know how interested we are in improving Vanagon
performance.  This company markets alot of high performance parts for other
VW's.  Check out thier web page listed above.  It is extremely interesting.
Dennis.
