Subject:      Radio suggestions???

Having searched the archives religiously to no avail, I am
broadcasting this request for radio recommendations for a '84 Vanagon.
The current &quot;SparkOMatic&quot; radio the DPO installed is awful. I remember
seeing something about a limited depth of the dash space for the
vanagon radio, so I am wondering what radios actually fit, IOW, what
is the maximum depth the radio can go?

If anyone has a used original equipment radio, I'd be very interested,
providing it works ;-).

Also, any suggestions for a source for a new antenna?

Thanks,
Paul Henderson
