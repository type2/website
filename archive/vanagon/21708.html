I didn't see it in any Bosch catalog.  Go to your local (or nearest)
_big_ RV dealer (emphasis on big), and just walk back to the parts 
department, and ask them about water heaters.  You might also want to flip 
through all the parts catalogs they have on their counter.

This is how I found discovered the heater.  I lived in Alabama at  the time,
though, so am unable to go back to the RV dealer and look it up. Different
dealers use different parts sources, so you may have to hunt around a little.
