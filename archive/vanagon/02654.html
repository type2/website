Subject: for sale, muffler

I'm on vacation and I ended up buying a brand new muffler when I didn't 
need one.  I currently have a muffler with 4000 miles on it that I'd like 
to sell.  If anyone is interested, please send me email quickly.  I'll 
dial in again from Utah in about 5-7 days.
(Vanagon 84 gas Gl 1.9L)

Thanks!
