Subject: Re: T34 Ghias For Sale

Morten-
They are both '64 1500 'S&quot; model T34 Ghias. One is blue/green with 
a white top. It is complete with ALL trim, lights, lenses, bumpers. 
The pan has some rust under the battery, and the body is straight. 
There is a small amount of bondo on the nose. All of the glass is 
complete and German. The interior is in fair shape. Also, in the dash 
there is a KPH speedo. The motor is complete but has a stuck valve.
I would like to sell it with another '64 T34 that is white with a 
black top, with a rusty pan and no title for $3900/OBO. I would consider splitting the pair.
Please E-mail for more info. I also have the original Owners manual.
