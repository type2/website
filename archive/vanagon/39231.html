Subject: VW Purchase in US


Dear Recipient/Thom,

can you give me a reference or even answer yourself the following question:
To import from the US a Passat, what adjustments are necessary. I know 
that the most expensive adjustment for other cars is the &quot;adjustable 
headlights&quot;, and presume/hope that the Passat does not need it, because
the car is manufactured in Germany. The dealer I talked with was not sure
however. 

Do you know also whom to contact for the formalities of importing a (private)
car into Germany (tariffs, duty, whatever)?

I appreciate any help you can provide me with.

With best regards  

Thomas Wenzel
