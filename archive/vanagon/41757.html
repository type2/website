Subject: Re: Eurovan Catalytic Converter


I read that &quot;little&quot; post on the web as well. The author of that post is a 
snivelling little git.....he's pissin' and moaning about the rear bumpers 
not being made of metal, that there is some great VW conspiracy to defraud 
buyers, etc....what crap!


Anyway, back to the matter at hand....the cat. Never had a problem with the 
cat....in fact, this a$$hole's complaint is that the cat is under the 
passenger compartment...well, so are the cats in most every car I know of...
so what's his point?

The correlary to his theory would be that I wouldn't need to run the heater 
in winter, right?

I'm EXTREMELY happy with my EV.
