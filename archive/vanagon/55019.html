Subject: RE: Squeaking suspension 

If, you engine does not warm up properly, you can cause excessive wear through improper 
lubrication.  That's why you have a thermostat.

Therefore, I would avoid a thermostat that runs the engine much cooler than the original.

&gt;On my 84 GL with 183k miles:
&gt;
&gt;Rear:
&gt;The rear suspension squeaks whenever it goes up and down especially at low
&gt;speed over speed bumps. Could it be the shock absorbers? What happens when
&gt;shocks begin to wear out eg do they get harder or softer?
&gt;
&gt;Front:
&gt;The front also squeaks when going up and down but because of the higher
&gt;pitch and shorter duration I suspect springs rather than shocks. I can get
&gt;this by pushing down on the wheel arch. In comparison the rear is more like
&gt;a long woosh than a quick squeak.
&gt;
&gt;What is the story on suspension squeaks? Rubber bits? Springs? Shocks?
&gt;Grease needed?
