Subject: plugged cat?  due to bad coil? 

quick question.  ive been diagnoseedd witha bad cat.  lost ignition coil last
week and cranked till battery dead.  is this enuf raw gas to destroy cat?
 been told cat has been clogged with carbon...any way to burn it off?
 symptoms are...van runs good for a minute before loosing power. can make
averything better by turning off ignition (WHILE RUNNING) then back on.
 resetting computer to ignore sensor readings for a minute.  ive been told it
alny takes a small amount of raw gas to destroy o2 sensor?????   im just
going to keep driving it in the hopes it may burn off.  but if it dosnt ..im
going to get a new cat from volkswagon parts place in mi, for 150$  any one
know of a better deal?
