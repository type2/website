Subject: Re: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS and greed and so forth...

I agree with Ken.  He does us all the favor of paying to maintain a list 
which we take for granted.  If selling tshirts help defray the cost of 
maintaining the list then we should support him.  If someone else WANTED 
to make up some type 2 tshirts, theres nothing Ken could do to stop 
him/her.  i think richard is doing the right thing by allowing Ken 
exclusive rights to the type2 logo.  Its not a matter of greed rather 
than economics.  Richard Im sure isn't in it to make money, rather than 
to supply a service to the rest of us.  Ken isn't planning on making any  
either, only hoping to lessen his expense which benefits all of us on the 
list.  Lets not hasten to call him &quot;greedy&quot;
