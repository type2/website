Subject: Re: 70 bus steering box


&quot;Getting blown all over the road&quot; is a product of two different things:

1.) Directional instability of the bus, which gusty winds really
bring out;

2.) Looseness in various parts of the steering, which make correcting
a swerve a larger effort than it should be.


My '71 bus was all over the road when I first got it, even more than
my '69 years ago. Its steering was (and still is) very loose.
Tightening thesteering box hasn't accomplished much. There are many
other parts to the steering linkage. A little wear in each component,
adds up to a lot of play from the steering wheel to the rubber on the
road.

The tires on the '71 were also El Cheapo off-brands, two different
sizes and brands, and very worn. I replaced them with BF Goodrich
215/75R14's from Discount Tire, for $49 each plus balancing, stems,
tax, etc. Yeah, I know, they're big, but I had my reasons.

The difference with the new tires was startling. It still swerves
a LITTLE in really gusty winds, but generally tracks straight! The
steering is still as loose as it ever was, but now there is not so much
need to saw the wheel back and forth, since now swerves don't start
in the first place.

The bad news is, of course, these tires cost about what you heard
for your new steering box. But the steering box might be only one of
the loose parts in your steering-- check out the drag link from the
box back to the axle, the bellcrank on top of the axle, your tie rod
ends, and your ball joints. Wear on ALL these parts is, unfortunately,
all too common. I have had my bus checked out, and sure enough, there
is some wear in each of these parts!

But first, check your tires! Make sure you have more pressure in the
rears than in the fronts-- this can also make a difference, and is
free.
