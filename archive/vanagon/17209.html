Subject: Re: how NOT to replace fuel h...

    I am laughing my ass off!!!  I just had a similar experience with my '71.
A few days ago I took a bath in gasoline myself, and I will, oh yes, brother,
second that emotion.
It
     Just 
      keeps
   pouring
and
                  pouring       and
glub,
  glub,    *panic*
and
I didn't get mt 
merit badge either,
friend.  But.............................

Hey! We've got new hoses and fuel lines and we didn't shell out $40 to $45
bucks an hour while we saturated our silly asses!! There'll always be that
one simple satisfaction when it comes to taking care of your own Bus; no
matter how long an easy job takes, no matter how many neighborhood children
go squealing to their mothers about all the gas in the gutters, no matter how
obsessive it DOES become; we're an integral part of our Bus' well-being, and
not a whole lotta Joes can say the same.
Kudos to the nutty guy with gasoline gushering out all over his belly!!! Cram
that hose onto there and be done with it! Find a beer and roll it over in
your head::::stanky, yes; but proud : )
