Subject: Rear axle nut. Uuugh!

Well, in the interest of saving my neck, I took a day off work
yesterday and did an all-around brake job on the '71 Bus.

(It sure is nice to be able to change the brakes without pulling off the
rear axle)

Well, I wanted to pull the axle anyway, because the wheel bearing grease
in there is prob. 10 years old. So, I tried to get the back nut off.
I knew I wanted to do this for the last month or so, so I have been annointing
the castle nut with liquid wrench and oil for about a month or so.

So, I tried with the large, craftsman socket, a 3/4 to 1/2 adaptor,
and a 1/2 inch breaker bar. After all, its ONLY 300 ft.lb. Well,
I banged on it, flamed on it, and leaned on it with 10 feet of cheater
pipe, and all I succeeded in doing is breaking another 1/2 inch 
breaker bar. I dont want to plop down the $35-$40 dollars for 
the 3/4 inch breaker bar without KNOWING it will take the nut off.
For the same amount, I could have the nut cracked with a chisel,
and put NEW nuts on. (I found a place near here that has ALL the VW
parts, even steering drag links, etc.)

So, what has worked in getting these nuts off for you? How big a
breaker bar, how long a cheater pipe? If I cook the nut with a
propane torch, will it cook the rubber grease seals?
