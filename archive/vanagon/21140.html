Russ Van Ness sez:
&gt; I'm resurrecting the aged (currently disconnected) power assist system
&gt; on my 71 Bus.  The original large vacuum hoses are cracked and
&gt; falling apart.  Is it possible to replace these with heater/coolant
&gt; hose or is there a &quot;special vacuum-only reinforced rubber&quot; hose
&gt; needed for this application?

I used heater hose on mine about a year ago. It works just fine.
I'll let everyone know when/if deterioration sets in.
