Subject: 86 GL for sale IN

I must reluctantly offer my Vanagon for sale to get something smaller and
better economy, would also consider and prefer a trade for a domestic small
truck with AT and cruse for the SO. I was intending on keeping it but she
hates it and I can't keep justifying the upkeep on it. It's a 86 GL Beige
Metallic paint, 155K, fair to good body, some seem rust on drivers side,
small dent in back also, pass side is good ex for rear fender, lots of rust
on it. Bumpers need replaced, but all in all in good shape for 11 years
young. AC is complete but not functioning (My dad said it worked when he
parked it in 95) Cruse not working, but it's there. Very small rock ding in
Front windshield, about as big as the head of a thumb tack, But it's been
there sense before my Dad bought it about 6 years ago and it's never gotten
any bigger, and it's at wiper-off level, so you don't even see it while
driving. Interior is dirty but should clean up well, small &quot;half moon&quot; tear
about the size of a golf ball in slider door panel. Weekender folds down
for bed in back. seats 7.

It has a gold mine of new stuff, (sense Feb when I got it), and I have ALL
receipts.

Clutch, PP, and all the stuff that goes with it, 
Clutch master and slave cylinders
assorted shifter pieces (it shifts very clean and easy now)
Main oil seal replaced 
Exhaust complete ex CAT
o2 sensor
starter
coolant tank, and I have an extra pressure cap,
Alternator
Passenger side upper control arm bushings
battery
front brakes including new rotors and calipers (just done within the last
month)
new rear wheel cylinders
tires (Goodyear reinforced, recommended ones at VW at the time, they have
about 15-20K highway miles on them) also does not have VW hubs it has 4
matching olds caps if you can believe that!

Gas Tank, control unit, idol controller, filter, and AC re-attached to roof
of van (recall work by VW)

assorted fuel and coolant hoses, water pipe on drivers side (this cost me
$100.00) 
and complete coolant flush and fill up with Prestone long-life phosphate
free. 

I have changed the oil religiously sense 125K when I got it, motor runs
strong with no signs of head gasket problems. Although nether myself or my
Dad had any head work done on her (he got it with 116K) 

All in all I think I have $2500+ in it and think its worth that. but will
consider offers above 2000. It would be a great Van for a list member who
doesn't want to start at the very beginning getting it into great &quot;list
member&quot; running condition. Some things that will need attention are It does
get warm when in idol traffic, may need a thermostat or possibly a rad. I
have forgotten it running in the driveway once and it never got above 2/3
but the fan comes on and you get the faint coolant smell. Also runs rich
when o2 sensor is connected, most of the major components that cause this
are still under warranty through VW from the recall work, and it's getting
about 18-22mpg without it. I just haven't felt like starting that fight
with VW or the SO to get it fixed. Also needs the plastic and rubber stuff
on top of the gas tank (the infamous &quot;leaks when it's full&quot; problem). BTW
We don't have emissions checks here in Indiana so I have no idea how well
it would fair in an out of state inspection. Send replies to me directly,
Thanks.
