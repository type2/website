  Yes, 
   I have, If it is an Automatic you are limited to 30 miles, at 
           40 MPH. Manual  no problem.  Syncro, you must remove the 
           drive shaft!

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any experience in moving an inoperative Vanagon a couple of
&gt; hundred miles using a Tow Dolly with the rear of the Vanagon mounted on the
&gt; TD axle and the front wheels on the road surface?  The Vanagon is without
&gt; engine, without spare tire and with one rear tire of questionable
&gt; character.
