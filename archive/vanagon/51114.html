Subject: RE:   First Westy questions....

&gt;Well, I've just gotten my new '81 Westy home and I've already got some
&gt;questions.  
&gt;
&gt;1st:  The faucet pump appears to not be working.  It looks to me like
&gt;the pump is in the faucet housing itself.  Is there an easy way to test
&gt;this, or will I have to remove it?  If I have to remove it, how do I go
&gt;about doing so?  

On my '80, the defunct pump was in the cabinet below, not in the housing.
Check the H20 lines.  The switch, however, is in the housing and should be
checked for continuity and ruled out before purchasing a pump.  I got my
pump from an RV store, it's a Shureflow, 1 gpm capacity.  I also tried a
Shureflow 1.6 gpm used in my sailboat, but the 1.6 gpm flow rate created
enormous pressure and was great for washing your hair but not your dishes!
&gt;
&gt;2nd:  The annunciator panel is being goofy.  It's telling me that the
&gt;battery is in the red zone when in fact the battery is A-OK.  What might
&gt;cause this?  I have no idea how this thing works.
&gt;
Dunno, really, mines not too reliable either.  PO said disconnect it
altogether when storing for extended periods as the LED's _do_  drain the
battery, eventually.

&gt;3rd:  The propane on/off knob on the outside of the van leaks propane
&gt;when turned on.  I guess that it's a seal of some sort that needs
&gt;replacing.  I suppose I can get a rebuild kit at an RV place?  

There's what's called a blow-off valve, that's how they know your tank is
full without taking it off &amp; weighing it -- the top is about 1/2 inch in
diameter and if you turn it counterclockwise it will emit propane -- if the
source of the leak is actually in the larger shutoff valve, then it's a
different matter.
&gt;

And I've got a question of my own:  anyone know if you can do substantially
better than $200 for a rear bumper from Parts Place for an '80 Westy??

happy motoring,

Peter                   '80 Westy       &quot;Penny&quot;
