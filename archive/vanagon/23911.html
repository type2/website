Subject:  spacer/felt ring on crankshaft?

hello folks. 

i just replaced my pilot bearing last weekend.  on p. 13.7  in the bentley
manual there is a diagram which shows a felt ring and spacer which i
did not encounter in the pilot bearing r/r.  i'm wondering if this is because
they got trashed when the pilot bearing went, or if it's because they're
behind it somehow and i didn't see them.  any experience with this (tim
s.)?  in any case, i didn't replace them cause i didn't see them/remove
them, and am wondering if i need to do so before i put the vehicle on the
road.  thanks for any help.

ps - the manual was definitely a large stretch for the wallet, but i'm glad
to have it.  no telling what it'll save me in the future, especially when
away from home and more importantly, when i don't have access to this
amazing list.  in addition, the interior is getting to be almost campworthy
(slowly but surely), can't wait to head north for a while.
