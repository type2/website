Yeah!! &lt;big grin&gt;

&gt; I think the simplicity gives you more control.  Yes, you have four levers

I have to concede that once you figure out how to use the levers, you 
have more control.  I do stand by my statement that it's not simple, and 
it's not intuititve.  Everyone raise your hand if you managed to figure 
out the heating system the first time without reading the manual. :-)

&gt; Any comments?

I'm sure we'll get lots -- you know, such a controversial topic and all. 
&lt;smile&gt;

I guess I'm just looking for anything to post about since the list has 
been so quiet lately.

Have a day!
