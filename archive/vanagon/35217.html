Subject: '75 in CV hell (epic) the last bolt

...and so after much ado, the idiot fog lifted.  Now remember, I was doing
all this work with the bus on the ground due to lack of trusty support, yes?
 Saturday afternoon found me cleaning, cleaning, cleaning those greasy
joints.  The 1/2 inch bit of bolt stuck in there actually tapped out with
ease (color me relieved!).  The &quot;crunchy&quot; cv was packed with what looked like
black clay, hard and sticky!  Lots of solvent, paper towels and hours later,
everything was shiny and pristine.

The last bolt, the rounded-out, inacessible pain of a bolt, was dealt with by
*carefully* jacking up that side of the bus ( the original Bilstein jack is a
very scary contraption, holding up a bus with a footing of 2 square inches?!?
- Aaaahhh!)  and rotating the wheel to a new position, making the bolt
*reachable* fer chrissakes!!!  Major idiotness at work here, because once I
could get the vice grips NEAR the bolt, more WD40 and lots of grunting
finally freed the thing!  I will keep the bolt as a memento of my painful
learning experiences...

Circlip note - these things are bloody awful to deal with!  I discovered that
to replace both boots, HEY! only ONE circlip need be dealt with - remove
circlip, tap out shaft, add boot, clamp, clamp, boot -   &gt;--|----|--&lt;   (wd40
on shaft and boots makes installation a LOT easier!)  tap bearing back onto
shaft, new ciclip, DONE.

Even with the spare driveshft/CVs, I ended up with only three out of six
joints in a usable condition.  Three bearings were pitted and scored in a
scary way (ALL the balls were spotless and shiny though. Hmm.)  One cv short,
I called the local VW guy the next morning and bought a new one for $58.  Got
down to the shop to find him cleaning up, no one else around (normally a BUSY
place) and realized IT IS SUNDAY!  He just decided to answer his phone, then
to let me come down for my precious &quot;last bit&quot;... the auto god is watching
over me!!

Back under the bus with bits in hand, assembled and ready to go - first axle
went in with no hassle.  The second one wouldn't line up, though, and by this
time the family was urgently calling me out from under to clean up and get to
mom's 77th birthday dinner on time!!  Climbed out, cleaned off, mom made me a
kicker of a martini, and went to dinner - lots of good food, good wine and
excellent company!

After dinner, not one to give up at this point, I'm back in my work clothes,
contemplating the rear of my bus. Then (!!!!) it hit me - if I trust Mr.
Bilstein _one more time_, just for a few minutes, I can *rotate the wheel*
into position to get that bugger on!  (Well, DUH!) Five minutes later, it was
a done deal, bus off jack, bolts all as tight as I can make them. Joy!
 Cheering and congratulations! Nirvana is attained!

Took off for home, no crunchy noises, no tok-toking, the job was done!  To
prove the point, I loaded four people and about 100 lbs. of luggage into the
bus at 4am Monday morning and took off to SF airport - about 100 miles away -
to deliver my friends to a Hawaii bound plane.  Spent a beautiful day in the
city and came home again with no trace of cv problems - power on!!  Maybe now
I can make it to a Camping Crazies outing!  (Martha? Are you listening?)  8-)

Thanks to Bob Hoover, Joel, Tom, Harvey, Bill and many others who gave great
advice and moral support to get me through this project.  It would have been
a much _longer_, nerve wracking job without all you kind listers here!

Bouquets and hugs to all,     _at_--&gt;---
