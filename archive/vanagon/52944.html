Subject: French Syncro Club

Dear Syncroists,

I just get into the Syncro's newsgroup and it's really interesting.
As an happy owner of a 16&quot; TD Vanagon GL Syncro - with Oettinger engine and
intercooler - which is called in France Caravelle GL, I'd like to know more
about the US Syncros. Here are a few questions :

- Do the US Syncro come with front and rear differential block as in Europe
or only with rear block?

- Is it possible to get turbo diesel Syncro from the US?

- Does anybody knows if there are a lot of differences between US and
European Syncro?

In France, people prefer to get diesel engines because of the stupid price
of the gas. Well, taxes... We are like you guys, we hate them! A gallon of
gas is between 4.5 and 5 bucks... Can you believe this?

There is a club in France which is called Syncro Club. There are about 70
members. If you know somebody who might be interested by that, we can share
informations about parts, specs, etc. The problem is that I'm the only
member who is wired to Internet. We Froggies are kind of low to get in these
electronic stuff...

So you can email me if you want to. I'd appreciate it. And I think one day
I'll get a Syncro from the US, they are usually in better shape than the
Europeans.
