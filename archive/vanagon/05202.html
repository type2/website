&gt;Gee, I wonder if they had to **WORK** ? &lt;grin&gt;

Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. couldn't be. must be network problems. :)

&gt;Maybe I should mention an oddity.  I was working in the back yard
&gt;Saturday when i noticed a pool of coolant on the floor of the
&gt;carport.  I put some more coolant in (it was low) and looked underneath
&gt;and saw that it was indeed dripping from somewhere up there -- looked
&gt;like from the waterpump seal.
&gt;Yesterday we drove the van a few times and each time I checked and there
&gt;was NO leakage.  I'm sort of baffled.  Could it have come out of the top
&gt;of the expansion tank for some reason?

look at the coolant tank (on the extreme left) and see if there is that
chalky-bird-droppings stuff under it and running down the metal shield over
the muffler. that's where mine was. about $40 for the tank.  when the water
pump leaks, mine ran down the oil filter.

also: the tank leaked more after the car had been shut off for a while, not
while it was running. never did figure that one out. and be SURE to get a
new o-ring for the coolant level sensor if you replace the tank ... i didn't
(the first time) and sure enough, it leaked all over the place.
