Subject: RE: Trip Report (Summer Trip )


--&gt;Las Vegas (saw the Dead there--it was HOT)

Gee, we rolled through several cities where the Dead were playing,
LV was one of them.  We stopped in a rest stop the next day, and
there were two buses parked there(both 68-70 vintage), with several
 fellows in sleeping bags crashed out on the lawns.  All the retired
RV goers were giving them the dirtiest looks.  Don't know why, it wasn't
thier lawn.

For some reason it seemed like the Dead were following us =)

&gt; where outside of Gainesville a couple of kids hit me from behind
&gt;and totaled my van :-(  --&gt;i was spun almost the entire way 'round, the
&gt;engine actually fell out of the van and was dragged for about 200yards.  After
&gt;checking out the damage, i also noticed that the entire thing was 
crumpled like
&gt; an acordian --wrinkles on the inside on the ceiling.  UGH!! what a way to end
&gt;an otherwise amazing trip.

That's gotta suck.  I feel very lucky that nothing like this happened 
on my trip.
(Except for the stoner in a truck that ran into me in Garberville, CA.  
Which wasn't
anything major, but did provide some entertainment =) )

Sorry to see a fellow '70 bus taken out of action =(

Jon
