Subject: F.S. Type 2 ambulance &amp; firewagen

This should really be on the Type 2 list , but since I could never figure out
how to get on there, I was hoping someone could post it on there for me.

For Sale: 1959 VW type 2 ambulance. All original white. Low miles. complete. Was
used as a campus ambulance for Princeton University. Some accesories include:
side retractible cargo door step, rear tow hook, windowless inverted rear hatch
for sliding in stretcher, roof mount red cross light, frosted side windows,
sliding glass cab divider, jail bars on ALL side windows, and a bunch of other
original ambulance acessories.

ALSO FOR SALE:  1965 VW type 2 firewagen with optional sliding cargo door. Low
miles.  All original red paint with handpainted original fire dept. coat of arms
and lettering in German.  Imported from Germany 2 years ago from son of original
owner of firehouse. Some acessories include: sirens, roof mount lights, upper
side marker lights, euro taillights and headlight lenses, plus many other
original firewagen accessories.

I am posting this for a friend who is liquidating some of his personal
collection due to too many vehicles. I have seen both vehicles and they are in
very nice shape and complete. what he is asking for them is very reasonable and
I'd buy them if it weren't for the fact that I already have 5 VW's.  

For more info, pictures, and prices, you can call him at (610) 926-6031  (Pa)
and ask for Curt. 

thanks,
chris
