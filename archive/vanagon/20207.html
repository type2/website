Subject: Is Ron Van Ness on this list?
Date: Tue, 4 Jul 95 15:16:48 MDT

I'm looking for Ron Van Ness.  His address at rvanness_at_neuron.ucho_dot_edu seems 
to have dried up and blown away.  The web site indicates that he has a 
photocopy manual for a BN4 gas heater.  Since I have one of these I'd like 
to get a copy.

If Ron is out there please Email me directly at aburczyk_at_dres.dnd_dot_ca.

Thanks

Andy Burczyk
