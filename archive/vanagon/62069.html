&gt;&gt; why yellow foglights? eh? 

It has to do with the refraction properties of yellow light through
suspended water droplets (fog).  You actually will be able to see things
better and further through fog if you're illuminating them and the fog with
amber light than with white.
Having your white lights on in fog actually detracts from your visibility,
but when they're mounted low enough and properly aimed they can illuminate a
fair distance below the fog and therefore not actuallt refract back at you.
Or at least that's how it's explained in automotive engineering circles.
