Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IDEA!!]

!!!IDEA!!!


Thom says he wants to run one now, well...

Do the split, BUT, have Thom &lt;or soemone!&gt; run a third that is subscribed 
to both, and sends to both...

so we who like it as is can use thatone, and the &quot;dweebs&quot; (My word, and 
disclaimed as such, all flames to ME not the list!) who dont liek the old 
way, which many of us DO, can use the individuals....of course, i guess 
thatthen there was no point in seprating in the first place:)

and, that would add extra time for maling in the lists, and extra 
'puters that can break....


in other words, i vote no split! er...spliting windows is fine..but...not 
lists!:)

&lt;not that its a democracy, but my 37.9 cents arnt even worth that usually&gt;




POM!

&gt; Gerry,

&gt; I appreciate the effort someone else is going to put into an aircooled van 
&gt; list...however, I think that there has ALWAYS been something special on this 
&gt; list which transcends air v water v T1 vT2 v T3 v T4 vans, and I would hate 
&gt; to see this disapear when the split window/loaf/early brick crowd has spun 
&gt; off onto another list....
&gt; 
&gt; You said that this is in partial response to those who had problems with the 
&gt; amount of traffic....to those I say (to play on H. Truman)...&quot;If you can't 
&gt; stand the traffic, get off the list&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; There are much more of us out there, I'm sure, who like the list and how it 
&gt; is run, and who would rather have the list stay the way it has always been 
&gt; handled.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you please make the split optional? Besides, think of poor Richard 
&gt; Palmer, he'll have to scrap his stock of V_at_L shirts and have to revert to 
&gt; ones with late Vanagons and EVs only.
&gt; 
&gt; PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T SPLIT THE LIST!!!
&gt; 
&gt; I'll buy you extra beer!!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We are loosing our sense of &quot;community&quot; here....
