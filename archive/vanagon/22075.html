&gt; Well, my honey and I made a trip to northern virgina last weekend in our 71 
&gt; camper.  The trip up there was pretty boring until, on I-66, the bus started 
&gt; pinging like crazy.  We pulled over and I loosened the dist. clamp to retard 
&gt; the timing.  I backed it off untill is was sounding good, and we progressed. 
&gt;  I had been running it at 10 BTDC static, and it tuns out that I retarded it 
&gt; to exactly 7.5 BTDC.  Go figure.  She ran great after that.  While in 
&gt; Sterling, VA I set out to check up on some VW's that I had seen before.  
&gt; There is a guy in Sterling Park who has 2 60's spilt windows.  One is parked 
&gt; out in front of his place, sadly rusting away.  To make matters worse, this 
&gt; baby is one of those ones with _all_ the windows, skylights and a sunroof.
&gt; I dunno if he is planning to restore any of these.  There is also a guy down 
&gt; the street who has a 74 thing that would make Martha crazy and morgage the 
&gt; house.  It is in very good shape, all pretty bonestock, with the least rust 
&gt; on any unrestored VW I have seen on his coast.  I talked with the owner for 
&gt; a while, and he isn't interested in selling it ... bummer. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, we headed off on Sunday afternoon down I-81.  Around Harrisonburg, A EV 
&gt; passed by in the usual manner.  That is, I am going 65, he is going much 
&gt; faster.  Struggle as I may, it is futile.  Anyway, about a half hour later, 
&gt; _another_ EV passed me, a different color.  Now, with the EV population as 
&gt; it is, what is the probability of this happening?  Two EV's in 1/2 an hour?
&gt; 
&gt; Other than the above, the trip was pretty uneventfull.  The bus averaged 
&gt; 19.6 MPG both ways, even with the timing change before we left.

Only two EVs in 1/2 hour...we usually see at least 3 every day on our way 
to work (and that doesn't include our own).  We're considered to be in 
NOrthern Virginia and on a good weekend I've seen up to 8 or 9 of them.  

As for Things, we've got at least two running around here in Woodbridge 
-- not counting the two we have.  I've even seen one driving in rush hour 
traffic on the HOV lanes to Washington, DC (that's High Occupancy 
Vehicles and you have to have at least 3 people in your vehicle to drive 
in the express lanes).  Unfortunately everybody was blowing by the Thing 
since it was struggling just to do the speed limit but it looked to be in 
fairly good condition and it was the original orange color.

We also have most of the busses in the area staked out too.  They seem to 
come in pairs as most driveways were we find them there are at least two 
of them.  The Beetles seem to come this way too, and it doesn't appear 
they're used for parts vehicles.  Bill has our teenaged daughters trained 
to spot every single beetle, bus, vanagon and EV in sight while driving 
down the road...they're now catching ones he misses.  He's now training 
them to spot Rabbits, Jettas, Quantums, etc.
