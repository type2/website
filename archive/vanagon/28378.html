Subject: Re: Speaking of vanity plates (and eatin' possum)

I used to have an Eat More Possum license plate on the front bumper of my
bus. Removed it when I moved from South Carolina to Washington because I
had to put a real license plate up front. Don't what it means, if anything,
I just thought it was strange enough to decorate my bus. Wouldn't dream of
actually eating a possum...

&gt;So Mark McCulley says:
&gt;&gt; There's an old bus I've seen several times out on the Olympic Penisula with
&gt;&gt; the tag &quot;GOGH VAN&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While driving home from Santa Clara to Sacramento last weekend (Saturday
&gt;afternoon)
&gt;I passed a '80 or '81 eggnog/primered Vanagon that had a sticker in the window
&gt;that
&gt;said &quot;Eat More Possum&quot;.  Thought it might be one of Joel's remote ken folk.  :)
