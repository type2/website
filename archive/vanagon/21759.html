 Whew, the response has been overwhelming!
Ok, for those just tuning in, here's the deal:
To order your vanagon list shirt, please send the following:
1. Check or money order for $15.00 ($20.00 non-USA residents) payable 
     to Richard Palmer
   Note- XXL and XXXL sizes are available, but please add $0.50.
2. Index card containing:
     I.   Name
     II.  Mailing address
     III. Phone number
     IV.  E-mail address
     V.   Number and size of shirts wanted

Please send those ASAP, as I want to get the order in by Monday, August
7. I expect it will take a month or so for them to be ready.
The $15.00 ($20.00 non-USA orders) will pay for shirt, and US MAIL
postage to send it to you. 

You will recieve a high-quality natural-colored shirt, with a 5 color
screen print on the front (4 colors + black outline)
The shirt will say &quot;NETVERGNU:GEN&quot; across the top, have the list address
across the bottom, and have front views of all 4 generations of buses in
the middle, about 3&quot; square each. I would like to put everyone's name
and address on the back, but that adds another screen charge, artwork
charge, and color, and therefore probably another dollar or so, so the
back of the shirt will be blank.

So- Please do not e-mail me with requests, just go ahead and send the
money and information. I will e-mail you as soon as I receive your
letter in the mail to confirm your order. I look forward to all this
working out.
Richard
