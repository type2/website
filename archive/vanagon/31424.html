Subject: Re: carbon cleanup


################
Hey now,
        St. Muir says, in the maintenance section, to run some diesel fuel
or bardhal through the carb to get rid of carbon deposits. He says this is
only for engines with over 40k miles. Is this an old fashioned version of
Techron? Or would there be some merit to my choking away through a quart of
diesel? TIA.

Peace,

Running diesel through my carb ('70 w/ 34pict) always gave me great 
fear.  I use a can o' spray _at_15,000mi (STP Carb Cleaner) which seems to 
eliminate The Crud.  

Anyone else care to comment?  Do I have Diesel Fear?
