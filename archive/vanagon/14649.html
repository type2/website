Excerpts from audi: 31-Mar-95 Re: Need Information about .. by John

&gt; &gt; only find a vanagon to stuff it into.  Diesel vanagons are too slow for
&gt; &gt; some people, but I think a 65hp 5 cylinder would make a big difference.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is why I asked previously about the new 1.9 liter tall block
&gt; diesel with the D shaped intake ports, the bigger four would certainly
&gt; fit and I figure it must have around 60-70 hp, but I don't know, the
I think that you're on the right track.  I only mentioned the 5 cylinder
because I have one sitting in my car(81 audi)  which won't pass
inspection in July because of rust problems.  The 4 would be a much
easier conversion.  All we have to do is wait for them to import the TDI
Golfs and Jettas(I've heard rumours of mid summer delivery), and wait
for someone to get rearended hard enough to total the car(and not get
hurt of course).  I believe that one of the California engine places
sells a bored-out bolt in 1.9 liter(nonturbo) rabbit replacement motor
which could probably be put into a diesel van.  

On another note, does anyone know what Diesel vans have sold for lately.
 I assume the cheapest way to get into a Westy is probably a diesel?
