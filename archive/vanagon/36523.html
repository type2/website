&gt; I subscribe to a number of mailing lists covering a variety of subjects.

&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?  Is it somehow related to leaking head
&gt; gaskets?  (The problem never occured with any of the aircooled.vw lists.)

Derek Drew used to complain of this ailment when he had an AOL account.  
But as soon as he got a proper Internet provider he stoped complaining, 
and started posting. :)  So, I gather it's a deficiency of the AOL software.
As for the Vintage VW mailing list, I only read interesting topics, and 
delete the rest.  Where as with the Vanagon list I at least glance at 
most of the mail.

I use procmail to sort the list to seperate files, and pine to read them.
