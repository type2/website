&gt; If this is the Saratoga Springs on Highway 9 just &quot;north&quot; of the town of
&gt; Saratoga that I am thinking of, I would clarify the :  &quot;&gt;About 30' from
&gt; Kelley Park. &quot;
&gt; where &quot;30' &quot; is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-15 miles, and depending
&gt; upon traffice 30-45 minutes driving time.
&gt; 
&gt; My interpretation of &quot; 30'  &quot; was thirty feet, which is definitely
&gt; incorrect!

Oops. Please forgive the fact that I come from a metric system part of
the world, where we use the symbol ' for minutes and the symbol &quot; for
seconds. I wonder if this was really confusing to a lot of people. In
any case, what I meant was 30 m. (not meters, minutes!) ;)
Of course, as VW enthusiasts, we have all experienced how much more
sense the decimal system makes...

PS: I would really hate to have started a thread on metric vs non metric
systems.
