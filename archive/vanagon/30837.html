&gt; I have an idea that I'd like to toss out to the list community. I've always 
&gt; maintained an alter of sorts on the dash of my bus. A rolling history of my 
&gt; travels. My alter tends to be natural in origin: wildflowers, leaves, 
&gt; sticks, stones, bones, kelp, sea shells, etc. with the occasional plastic 
&gt; novelty thrown in for good humor.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is to create a &quot;VW Bus Dashboard Alters&quot; web page with photos of 
&gt; various dashboard alters. I'm willing to host the page if there is enough 
&gt; interest. Let me know (nicely) if this idea is too weird or crazy or boring, 
&gt; or...

I like the altar idea, kinda, and the website might be interesting.  I never
thought of it but it might not hurt, just for psychological value.  Seems
like a moving altar might get knocked around a lot with stuff flying all
over. . .how to build a stable platform?  Maybe it'd be better to set up a
flat table between the front seats or somewhere in the rear of the bus.
Should be dedicated to a god of travel, like Mercury or someone like that.
Myself, I just stick to &quot;all-seeing eye&quot; decals in the windows for good luck
(like the eyes that fishermen paint on their boats to avoid accidents.)

&gt;Be careful, as in some states, Virginia for instance, it is illegal to
&gt;have items hanging from the rear-view mirror, and generally impeding
&gt;your view of the road. It's one of those laws they use to stop
&gt;&quot;suspicious&quot; vehicles, like busses, and search them without consent,
&gt;since you've already broken the law...

I've often wondered about this: Do Buses tend to get pulled over more than
other vehicles because of supposed police prejudice?  I don't mean really
obvious, Grateful Dead style buses, just regular ones.  I'd hate to have to
deal with this, as I have been known to transport various &quot;magical&quot;
substances for friends.  I like those Owsley Bear stickers, too, but I
wonder how many folks are hip to the meaning of them. . .??
