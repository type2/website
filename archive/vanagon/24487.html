Hi:

I have a campmobile. It has been giving me some trouble with the 
clutch being burnt.  I was told by one mechanic that I should keep 
track of the cooling system.  Since I am not mechanically inclined, I 
would like to know what all should I be aware of.  I really love my 
van and would hate to give it up. Please oblige.

Also, where can I purchase these Westfalia tents.

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks,
Atul
