Steve:

I had to replace my pads about every 30k miles too. Every time I found out
at least one pad had no meat left. And the remaining metal was eating my rotor.
But no real damage made though. No idea how long I had driven under that
condition. I just put new pads in and everything was fine. I did have to
replace the rotors the 2nd time when new pads were due. The thickness was down
to the limit.

I did not have difficulty to push the pistons back. I used a large a screw driver
to kind of press it with the tip and against the rotor. I seem remember that I
did not need to bleed the brake. I did bleed the brake when I replaced the rotors.
I replaced my rotors myself too. I used a chisel to punch the bearing race out.
The thing is such a hard metal. I thought if I damaged it then time to get new
ones. But with quite a bit of punching to drive it out and back in to the new
rotor, couldn't see any sign of dent or anything. Need to replace the grease
seal though. I have had bought another set of rotors since they are about due
to be replaced again.
