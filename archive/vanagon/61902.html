&lt;&lt; i think you are mistaking the Mercedes factory-mounted foglights for
 &gt; headlights. in France and Canada, foglights have to be yellow. in other
 &gt; countries, foglights CAN be white or yellow. Mercedes chose yellow for
 &gt; all. &gt;&gt;

I'm a little late to jump into this thread, I know,  but I looked into this a
while back, after a trip to Paris a few years ago. Yes the headlights were
yellow. ( this was '89)

Anyway, I called a local foriegn auto parts and accessory store in Reading
(KAM Specialties) and the guy said he could get the bulbs, tho they wouldn't
be cheap, or for that matter, technically wouldn't be legal either. 
He said he had a set in his MG and got pulled over by the Staties. 
I guess nowadays there are more those amber fogs on highline cars, that
they're more of the norm.
