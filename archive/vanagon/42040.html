&gt;one thing i have noticed: i figured light colored fabric would be best ...
&gt;reflect the heat, you know. yeah, well, maybe ... but what it does do is
&gt;let a LOT of light inside. darker fabric would make it darker and easier
&gt;to sleep in wal-mart parking lots. ;)
&gt;

I recently bought some fabric for making curtains and &quot;looked through&quot; a lot
of fabrics and found that the light permeability has a lot more to do with
the weave of the fabric than the color.  I ended up with a light grey fabric
that lets almost no light through.
