Subject: Re: deep cycle battery


&gt;&gt;I keep seeing in the paper, ads for marine batteries. Aren't these
&gt;&gt;deep-cycle types, used for electric trolling motors etc.? Why wouldn't
&gt;&gt;they work as auxiliary batteries in Westies, to power the stereo,
&gt;&gt;lights, fridge etc. when stopped?
&gt;
&gt;Too big (tall) to fit in the standard battery compartment.  Should fit 
under
&gt;the rear seat though.

Nobody makes a shortie, to fit under a bench seat in a boat maybe?
