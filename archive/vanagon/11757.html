&gt; 	I'm thinking head temp with two senders- one from #3 and one from

&gt; he spark-plug washer? 

Yep--but it's nearly impossible to thread the spark plug into the head with
all the sheet metal in the way.  I ended up cutting off the end of the 
sender, making a good junction between the two thermocouple wires, and
epoxying it to the head.  I feel a better way to attach these is to drill
and tap a #8 or so hole near where you want to monitor temperature, crimp
on an appropriate lug on the end of the thermocouple wire, and attach it
that way (you won't have to fiddle with the thing when you pull the spark
plugs).

&gt; 
&gt; 	Of course I'll use a dual sender pressure so the oil pressure idiot
&gt; light works. 

Likewise with mine.

&gt; 
&gt; 	For oil temp, I guess I use the 'dipstick' sender- anyone
&gt; have experience with this? Does it really work? How does it work?

My sender takes the place of the plug for the forward oil pressure
relief valve.  Nearly as easy to do as the dipstick sender, and
much neater.

&gt; 
&gt; 	And, of course, a tachometer. I figure this can go in the
&gt; blanked hole the factory provided for a clock, and the rest can go
&gt; in one of those nice VDO rubber block mounts either below the dash
&gt; or maybe above the dash... view over the dash of a '70 isn't
&gt; going to be compromised by instruments above the center section...

I don't have a tach, but there have been times when I wish I had.  Not
very often, though.  I have the three position rubber block mounted
under the dash, just to the right of the steering wheel.  It's a pretty
good location, except that when the steering wheel is in the nominal
center postion, the center rib perfectly covers the gages.  I either
have to move my head around to see it, or look at it only while I'm
turning!  Actually, it's only a minor inconvenience.  The rubber block
is the only way to go if it's mounted down there.  I'm constantly
banging into it with my knee while climbing around, or smacking it
with my knuckles while shifting.

&gt; 
&gt; 	Other possibilities include volts and amps. Wacky possibilities
&gt; include transmission oil temp, exhaust gas temp, manifold vaccuum, 
&gt; a VDO clock... and an altimiter! :-)

How 'bout an inclinometer?  And, oh yes, I wish I could figure out a
way to monitor tire pressures while driving (slip rings and brushes?) :-)

&gt; 
&gt; 	Anyone have suggestions/experiences/instruments you wished
&gt; you'd had or once saw? My engine is a single-port 1600, stock carb.

I have oil temp, pressure, and ammeter.  I will soon be reattaching my
head temp gage.  Other than that, I've never really needed anything
else (except maybe the clock).

Good luck!
