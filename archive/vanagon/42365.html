Subject: Re: Old Volks Repair Book

I was at the local used book store during lunch today (looking for a
Bentley manual), and found the book &quot;Fix Your Volkswagen&quot; by Jim Purvis.
Kind of a fun book as it was published in 1964 and covers both the 1200 and
1500. It's got the original cover on the front with a bunch of elves
climbing all over a Bug.  No bus specific content, but still fun to thumb
through. Anyone used it before?

yes- and actually the early edition have pictures of 25hp and 36hp motors in
it  :)
