Subject: '78 Bus Identity Crisis

We recently bought a 1978 VW Kombi (aftermarket conversion to camper).  
Problem is, I don't know what company did the conversion, and after reading 
postings on the list about Safare, Westy, etc., my poor bus (we named her 
Pearl) is having an identity crisis!  PLEASE HELP

As I said, PEARL is a 1978 Transporter Kombi (I tracked that from VIN).  She 
was converted to a camper in 1978 (or so said the previous owner).  The 
pop-top is unusual (compared to Westy) in that the entire top raises (4 feet 
or so) and has nifty vented windows with shades built into the canvas.  A 
plywood board slips out over the sunroof opening creating a double wide top 
bunk.

 Much of the interior is apparently Westfalia (there are little plaques on 
some of the cabinets saying Westfalia 1978 and then a bunch of stuff in 
German...).  

Directly behind the passenger seat there is a metal wall (about the same 
height as the seat), behind this sits a 2-way fridge (110/12V) and a 
2-burner propane stove.  This arrangement is nice for cooking (as you can 
stand outside if you wish) but it blocks access to the sliding door latch 
(in that respect, sounds similar to the Safare).

Behind the driver's seat there is a full height cabinet, then a sink-water 
tank-storage tank arrangement.  There is an electric pump for the little sink.

The rear seat folds out and gives a double bed extending to the back over 
the engine compartment.

Does anyone recognize this configuration as a standard aftermarket camper 
conversion?  I thought maybe it was homemade and it could be, but the 
fibreglass top is definitely manufactured.  Also there is a second battery 
for fridge etc.  A small propane tank is mounted under the stove/frdige unit.  

Please help Pearl trace her roots!
