Ralf's talk about high speeds and oil remind me of my trip down to Ashland OR
from Eugene one summer.  It was _at_100 F and I drove poor Bobo, my `74 bus,
around 65-70 the whole way.  I don't think he overheated horribly except when
I stopped a couple of times and shut the motor off, letting all that bad heat
accumulate with nowhere to go.  In any case, the next day I checked the oil
and over half of it was gone and the rest was pitch black.  That was also
before I had heard of the evils of 10W40...

Nowadays I still routinely drive Bobo at 70 MPH for hours at a time on the
freeway (it's hard not to without, as Joel mentioned, getting flattened by the
speed differential).  I kind of enjoy driving him at 60 or so, faster than
that and it's pretty loud.  On the other hand, I don't like being the slowpoke
either.

Top speed has been 83 a few times, and once to 87 with a tailwind.  That's no
fun though and I probably won't repeat it unless provoked.

Just adding my data points...
