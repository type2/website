Howdy,

	This AM before I took off fer work, I say to heck with it and moved
the little idle adjusting screw out (left, like a bolt) about 2 turns.

	The bus ran _great_ and didn't diesel when I got to work (about
15 miles)   Normally it would have dieseled after a trip to the driving range
(about 3 miles) or less.

	What did I do wrong? 

PS:  Please note my sigs are random now.  Gone is the appearance of a tirade
against lawyers!  &quot;Your point being?&quot;

Thom
