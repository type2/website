Subject: Rustoration Blitzkrieg, Day 1

Lo,

	Well, day one on the Rustoration Blitzkreig went quite well.  I 
finished cleansing the left side of the engine compartment, and primered
it; ground off all the excess Bondo on the left rear corner (Driver's side)
and sussed everything up real nice and primered it; and fabricated my
replacement piece for the right side of the engine compartment. I also
did some more xtending on the cargo floor, and sealed up the left rear
wheel well and along the floor with body caulking.

	Tomorrow, I might get a chance to go out to the junkyards and get
the new gas tank - I know some of you are dying to find out if that works!

	I'm dismayed that nobody has responded to my request for more informmation
on the bulkhead fitting for the fuel line...

	Also, any ideas what I should do with my choke cable?  I'm thinking of
using it for a secret gas or fuel cutoff.  Whadaya think?

Thom
