Subject: O-ring or gasket between heater core and valve?

Hello-
	I recently replaced the rear heater core in my 87 syncro. When I
separated the valve and the core, there was no gasket between the two, nor
was one included with the new core... I found that the gap between the two
leaks when pressed from the side (like when I tried to put cover for the
heater back on ;) ). Does anyone know if they is supposed to be an O-ring or
gasket? Any recommendations on some gasket goo that will seal and set
quickly? Thanks in advance...
