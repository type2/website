&gt; &gt; Apparently synthetic sheds the heat into the case, and in our little 
&gt; &gt; air (really oil) cooled engines, you need the heat to stay in the oil 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really having trouble with this last statement.  I realize that the
&gt; oil passes through the engine and thereby absorbs some of the heat, but
&gt; I still believe that the air/fan does most of the essential cooling.
&gt; Anyone care to comment on this?  Maybe the synthetic doesn't absorb
&gt; as well as the dino-oil?

I think air does the majority of the cooling, but it only cools the
outside of the heads and cylinders.  The oil cools the inside of the
engine, which is also critical.  Contrary to what Michael saw, I noticed
only a slight increase (if any) in oil temp when I went from dino oil to
synthetic.  Still, I'm staying away from synthetic for now because of
it's supposed reduced specific heat (is that the right term?).
