Subject: Re: Towing a Bus

&gt;What is the best way to tow or generally transport a non running '73 bus
&gt;approximately 45 miles on mainly backroads.  I believe the bus is safe except
&gt;for the fact that the engine is dead.  I was recently pulled by a chain about
&gt;15 miles in a really beat up '73 bus and didn't feel particularly safe.  Once
&gt;I rented a type of trailer that just holds the front wheels, but the deal fell
&gt;through and I wound coming home with an empty trailer.  How do these trailers
&gt;work?  Any suggestions would be helpful.  If you recommend a rental item the
&gt;approximate rental price of that item would be nice if you know it.
&gt;Thanks

&gt;P.S.  I'm sure my girlfriend's mother will be thrilled when I tell her I'm
&gt;going to be storing another non-working bus at her house.
&gt;

Those nylon tow straps are nice.  They cost about $20 or so.  When the towee
spaces out for a few seconds and the strap slackens, it doesn't usually jerk
that much when the strap is tightened again (the strap stretches).  The bus
has little loops welded to the front of the frame intended for towing use.
If towing with another VW, don't wrap the strap around the bumper.  The
towee should try to do the braking for both vehicles.  It doesn't hurt to
write (with white shoe polish) on the rear window of the towee's vehicle,
&quot;CAR IN TOW.&quot;  If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the
residents can't read, this might not help.

I wouldn't try this in city or freeway driving, but out in the country it
should be okay if you're careful.  Also, it's not a good idea to tow at night.
