&gt; A little while ago, my clutch slave cylinder failed and due to the
&gt; location and the time (Washington DC at 1 am) I decided to take a
&gt; carefully planned route to a safe haven, cranking over in second and
&gt; actually making it there without having to stop (or shift).  I
&gt; mentioned this to some people I work with and a few mentioned they
&gt; &quot;knew people&quot; (don't they always?) who shifted their manual trannys
&gt; without using the clutch just by cranking over in gear and just jamming
&gt; the lever in for the upshifts.  I putted along in second at about 25-30
&gt; mph, but some sections it would have been nice to have had third gear.
&gt; I realize it is not exactly safe to do this, but it was a personal
&gt; decision based on real world circumstances (14 hour night shift, 1 am
&gt; in South DC, no other way home, etc).
&gt; 
&gt; Question-Does anyone have personal experience or can advise of the
&gt; damage, if any, that may be incurred by shifting without using the
&gt; clutch?  This is the second time in my life I have had to limp home
&gt; without a clutch (first was with an old Mustang).
&gt; 
&gt; And to concur with what an earlier listmember posted, the slave
&gt; cylinder failed 200 miles after the master cylinder failed (luckily in
&gt; my driveway). Probably would have replaced both had I known it happens
&gt; in pairs, the slave was pretty easy to replace.

Changing without a clutch is relatively straightforward:

Start in second gear - although, with practice, first is also feasible,
accelerate and when you reach your normal change point, take your foot
off the gas and immediately move the gear lever into the next gear - if
you do it smoothly at the right point when the dropping revs match the
revs for the next gear, it slots into gear perfectly smoothly..   For
downshifts, use the double-declutch approach - take your foot off the
gas pedal, move the gear lever into neutral, rev the motor to slightly
above the revs that would be normal for the lower gear at the speed
which you are currently travelling and then smoothly move it into the
lower gear..  On occasions, just for the fun of it I do this for a full
trip (including reverse parallel parking!)  It is a bit heavy on the
starter motor and, if you are heavy-handed on the gear changes will
probably wreck your synchromesh cones.

Have fun
