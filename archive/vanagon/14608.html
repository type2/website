Subject: I might be able to get this thing back together!

Today, I went by the machinist, and after telling him the sad fate of my 
engine, he gave me:
4 pistons
4 cylinders
4 connecting rods
1 crank gear.

All free!!
I know what your'e thinking, worn out parts are always free.  I did the old 
feeler gauge inbetween the ring and piston trick, and all 4 are a real tight 
.0025&quot;  Almost new!!  So know I have to decide what to do, replace all the 
pistons and rering the ones I just got, and what about the cylinders?  
Should I replace them all, or use the three and replace one?  Other than 
these decisions, it looks like I'll just need new bearings and a cam and of 
course seals.  Looks like this baby might be back on the road again.  The 
above free parts came form a 1600 which overheated so bad that the head blew 
out right around the spark plug hole.  Ugly.

I'll take all kinds of advice here-
