Thanks for posting the notice.

I had fourty responding messages this morning (about 24 hours later) from 
people along the proposed route.

I failed to mention we will take a ferry from Blind River, ONT to Tobermory, 
ONT ... it is a beautiful route and passes near/over an submerged Provincial 
Park (like a National Park in the U.S.A).

Allowing only 50% to 25% of the initial respondents actually participate, I'm 
still impressed.

I have a feeling there will probably be caravans for significant portions of 
the trip.

I don't plan to post more until I get a pretty stable list of respondents and 
begin to add substance to the itenerary.
