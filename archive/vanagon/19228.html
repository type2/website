&amp; &amp; speeds.  The reason I get two readings is because I have two gauges, one is
&amp; &amp; for the dash gauge and is located in the case at the oil pressure regulator,
&amp; &amp; the other is for the FI computer and is located in the doghouse oil cooler 
&amp; 

Sounds like an interesting idea to use the engine temperature sensor
of the FI unit to check your engine temperature. Can you hook up a 
gauge to that sensor in parallel to the ECU without altering the 
readings for the ECU? What gauge did you use? Jens.
