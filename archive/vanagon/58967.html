Subject: SOS: Family Stranded in Misbehaving (Watterlogged?) Vanagon

Volks, 
Wife children and mom-in-law were driving the 87GL yesterday for many
hours in drenching rain when the Vanagon presented the following
problems:
a) severe loss of power: undriveable
b) stalling
3) idling at 500 rpm
Vanagon was towed to -very small- NE Texas town where few have seen such
a craft. Nearest VW spoken in Dallas about 150 miles away. I called
shop/tow lot and spoke to owner. He has driven it today 6 miles at
&quot;65-70 MPH&quot; with zero problems.
The rain here in Texas is near flood conditions from here in the Houston
area (10 inches yesterday) and up where my wife is near Dallas about the
same. 
Apparently something has shorted out, or otherwise not held up under the
hours of exposure to lots of water. The mech/towlot owner felt that the
air cleaner may have been saturated w/water, thus restricting air flow
and confusing EFI. My brother in law was following them yesterday when
the probs happened and he removed the Air cleaner and shook it out as
well the mech did the same. That is all that has been done to the
Vanagon and now runs OK apparently.
 I am dubious about having them drive the Vanagon home at this point
until this bad storm clears the eastern portion of Texas.
Any thoughts? Similar situations? Places to look? The Vanagon is
apparently road worthy now but I fear further strandings of my loved
ones.
Any and all -expeditious- feedback greatly appreciated.
