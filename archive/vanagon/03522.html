Subject: Re: floor mats

Try this option: cost alot less and actually looks good.

Almost from any home repair/hardware store go to the area
where they sell the indoor/outdoor carpeting.  It's clear
(mine also has raised sort of grip lines running across) and
has the small no-skid 'tits' on the bottom.  Everyone has
seen this stuff - it's usually used in buildings/homes/etc.
and strips are laid down in the high traffic areas.  Anyway, the
stuff is on a spool, about four or six feet wife.  Buy what you
need, get out the scissors, and cut to fit.

&gt; Hi, everyone
&gt;
&gt; Someone last week asked about floormats, so here's my contribution to the
&gt; search:
&gt;
&gt; Lloyd Design Group
&gt; 8435 Telfair Ave.
&gt; Sun Valley, CA  91352
&gt; (818)768-6001
&gt;
&gt; For the Vanagons they make a 1,2, or 3 piece floormat set (I hear the 1 piece
&gt; is the one to get) for the front.  Depending on whether you have
&gt; the forward facing bench or the rear facing captains, there is a rear passenge
&gt; floormat set that will fit.  Lastly, they also make a mat to cover the rear
&gt; cargo area.
&gt;
&gt; Now for the bad news:  They (Lloyd) only sell to VW dealers, repair shops,
&gt; and independent parts/service dealers, so you may have to search around for
&gt; these mats (or samples to look at).
