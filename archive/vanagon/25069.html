Subject: Price of parts too over haul 85 vanagon motor?



	I found a 85 with 156000 miles on it but the motor sounds like
it needs to be over hauled, its has a bad knock. What kind of $'s am I
looking at for just the parts to go thru the whole motor, and can anyone
recomend a good parts store to buy them from? What will a rebilt cost ?
Thanks for any info!!
