&gt;     &gt; &gt; When I saw the above notation, I envisioned *four* gauges,
&gt;     &gt; &gt; one for each cylinder. Is this overkill? Is this
&gt;     &gt; &gt; obsession? Is this insurance? Is there a 4-cylinder gauge?
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     &gt; So, yes, you can just go out and buy one. Go to your local BIG
&gt;     &gt;newsstand and get a copy of &quot;Trade-a-Plane&quot;, and browse the ads for
&gt;     &gt;guages and sensors...
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     &gt; Mind you, none of this stuff is cheap. Single CHT or EGT guages
&gt;     &gt;for aircraft typically cost on the order of $200. Yow. It's the
&gt;     &gt;paperwork, see, it has to exceed the weight of the part or it's not
&gt;     &gt;safe for an airplane.
&gt;
&gt;     If you read the ads carefully, you can avoid the cost of the
&gt;     paperwork. Get guages for &quot;experimental aircraft&quot; or &quot;amateur built
&gt;     aircraft&quot;. These do not have the paperwork, are not legal on
&gt;     regular planes, but will do just fine on anyone's bus! Also, aircraft
&gt;     junkyards advertise in Trade-A-Plane, and you can get these things
&gt;     used too.

Uh, or you could just get four senders and a rotary switch which is all a
plane has...
