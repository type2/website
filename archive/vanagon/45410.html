Subject: TIMING THE GOOD OLD DAYS 74


IT is nice to know that other people adjust there timing buy feel.  The   
guy who built my trick motor power tunes the motor buy going up hill in   
3rd gear and adjusting the timing until it runs its best.  My 1.7ltr   
motor was really fast until I took it to someone else and they tried to   
adjust it to a stock timing.  At stock it ran really Hot and also like I   
was hauling a ton of bricks.  It has taken me several week to try to get   
my performance back in my bus.  I am close but not quite there yet.  Now   
I am getting a new clutch put in my bus that I burned up after only 4500   
miles.  With my timing marks on my 74 westie with type 4 it seems the   
more I advance it the more it runs better,  I am now running about 20 deg   
advance at Idle speed.  Seems way to much but it runs better that way.  I   
figure with shaved heads, Total Seal rings, 009 distributor with a   
Ignitor, dual 40 dell carbs a hot coil and the motor is balanced and I   
run non resistor plugs, the timing has got to be way off normal to run   
right or my timing mark is off!   Later  Erick    Ps Further festival was   
great but hot in Raleigh.
