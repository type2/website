Subject: Wierd Step (was: Wanted:  seat belt.  can trade for a wierd step)


&gt;&gt;Also, i have an entry step that slides into the front and rear jack
&gt;&gt;points on the vans.  it reportedly came on a 70's bus but still fits
&gt;&gt;the vanagon.

(snip)

&gt;OOOH!  i have an EXCLUSIVE item?!!?  a rareity??  Price just
&gt;quadrupled.  Naw.  couldn't do that.  samo offer.

Uh... my '71 had one of those when I got it. Still does. Kinda cool,
but those jack points are known for their lack of strength. Since I'm
40# overweight, I take it pretty easy on that step; but my 6-year-old
son loves it!
