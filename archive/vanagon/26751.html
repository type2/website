Subject: Re: '85 lifter noise, steering pump too.

Saw your note about the 85 GL--
&gt;
&gt;First is what sounds like lifter noise.  It's one lifter and I only heard it
&gt;run for about three minutes at idle.  The owner said the sound goes away
&gt;after it warms up.  He started to mention that his mechanic told him that a
&gt;lot Vanagons do this but I'm skeptical.  Any thoughts?  Is there some
&gt;miracle rhino-snot that I can dump in and flush the lifters with?

Apparently lifter noise is common and likely harmless when vans sit a long
time...see Technical Bulletin 15 87-02.  I have had this symptom on my 86
when it sits a week or so.  Normally it goes away quickly.  Reving up the
engine several times may help.
