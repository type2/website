Subject: RE: conduit for your bus?


_______________________________________________________________________________
I was thinking about running a piece of flexible conduit under my bus to 
allow for the many wires I'll be running for the gauges.  Has anyone done 
this, or better yet how and where do you run the wires for the gauges? ]

  I've got a wire relaying engine temperature that runs beneath the
  camper, don't like it too much (previous owner's doing). Take your
  time and route the wire inside the vehicle. My two cents worth...
