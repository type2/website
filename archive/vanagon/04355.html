Subject: '59 Pickup Windshield Rubber Installation!

I installed new rubber in my '59 Single Cab last week. Did both windshields
and the back window. 

I was surprised at how differently the windscreens went in compared to the
backlight. On the fronts, I was able to push them into the openings (with
rubber on) fairly easily, and then use the soap and string trick to get the
lip over the body opening. I was able to do this by myself. 

The rear window was another matter. It didn't fit the opening at all. I had
to get a friend to push as hard as he could against it while I worked hard
to pull the rubber lip over the body. Finally, once a certain amount of the
lip was over, it started to slip into the opening. 

But no more leaking this winter. It looks better, too! 

Next I'll do the door and sliding window rubber. Has anyone compared the
West Coast Metric and, say, the Wolfsburg kits?

Bob
