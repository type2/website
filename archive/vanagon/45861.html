Subject: Re: Nuts!...Axle Nuts!


&gt;I got home, heated the nut [which had been soaked with penetrating oil
&gt;the night before...again] one more time for good measure, put the bear
&gt;of a socket on it, attached the bar, added eight feet of pipe, opened
&gt;the driver's door and climbed up, then transferred my weight onto the
&gt;pipe [Ok..so I jumped].  The pipe made the most amazing arc and then a
&gt;rather load &quot;groink&quot; echoed throughout the neighbourhood and the &quot;Nut&quot;
&gt;did move.

&lt;laughing&gt;

&gt;Of course, now I am faced with the dilemma of how to coax those brake
&gt;drums off...

This next requires one large ball peen hammer (such that the round end is
slightly smaller than the axle, about $35), one three or five pound sledge,
and two people. I don't know if this would tear up the trans in a swing
axle or not, but it has never hurt one of my IRSs.

First person places the rounded end of the peen hammer against the axle.
Second person pries outward on the wheel with a bar or something, levering
against whatever he can find. First person then smacks the head of the peen
hammer with the sledge with all the vigor he can muster. First person hits
it hard and often.

Hub should break loose by the time first person's arm is tired or second
person is accidentally struck in the skull with the sledge, whichever
happens second.

This might ruin the bearings, but

(a) Now you'll be able to get the hubs off to change them if it does, and

(b) You ought to replace them anyway because obviously nobody has packed
them for decades. ;)
