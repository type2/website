Subject: RE: How do I stop this oil leak?

Jonny,

Is it possible that your entire drain plate has gotten whacked (especially if 
the car is lowered)?  Just a thought..

==========================================================
I've got a pretty steady oil leak dripping off the little nuts 
surrounding the oil drain plug on my '71. I've replaced the paper 
gaskets, the brass washers, the little nuts and even the entire round 
metal plate with no success. How the hell do I stop this thing?!

Thanks,

--Jonny
