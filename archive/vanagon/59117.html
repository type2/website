&gt; crazy while singing Deutschland Uber Alis, ordering the LiMBO's Dometic
&gt; Fridge manual (for a 182 B, I actually have a 182 C), pumping like crazy

&gt; I am now convinced my piezo isn't sparking.  I think I will try to remove
&gt; the fridge this weekend.  I don't know what good that will do even if I do
&gt; get it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Still waiting for a Dometic miracle......

Hi Kelly.  I have a 91 Syncro Westie with a Dometic 182C and for
whatever its worth I had to replace the piezo (under warranty) even
after praying to those same gods.  I bought the westie new and had to
replace the sparker after about a year.  Since then the fridge has
worked flawlessly. 

Good luck and hope you're sparking your propane soon (safely, of
course).
