Subject:      Re: Part numbers for '71 bus

On Thu, 4 Jan 1996 14:12:19 -0600 you said:
&gt;short of it is:  where can I find a parts number listing for my bus?
&gt;Do the dealers really give away the old fiche?  Here in the rust belt

it's not toooo likely, as they don't get a new fiche very often. BUT!!!
i found out from my friendly far-away dealer that they ORDER those fiche!!
so you might be able to pay them for a new fiche. he said they cost about
$20 per fiche. it's worth asking about anyway. (i haven't ordered one yet).
and i think the 1968-1979 fiche is still available.

then, all you have to do is find a fiche reader with a printer. :)
