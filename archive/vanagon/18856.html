Subject: Distilled vs. Tap H20, chemical explanation. (fwd)

I got this off the Porsche list, and I thought it was a pretty good
disertation on rust and &quot;proper&quot; antifreeze, both of which are irrelevant to
me because I live in California and have only air-cooled cars!

&gt; Subject: Distilled vs. Tap H20, chemical explanation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From my brother the Chemist:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I decided to do a little experiment. I polished a small sheet of 
&gt; &gt;aluminum, washed it with a solvent, and cut off 4 strips. I placed
&gt; &gt;each strip in identical jars which had been cleaned in a laboratory. 
&gt; &gt;I filled each jar as follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. 100% distilled water
&gt; &gt;2. 100% tap water
&gt; &gt;3. 100% Prestone
&gt; &gt;4. 50% Prestone, 50% distilled water 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That was May 19th. Today, here are the results so far:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. White precipitate (flakes) coating the top surface of the
&gt; &gt;aluminum.   (looks almost like 1 mm specs of dandruff) There are 
&gt; &gt;also flakes settled  at the bottom of the jar.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;2. About 1/4 the precipitate of jar 1. The flakes are much smaller,
&gt; &gt;almost  making the water look cloudy rather looking like they are in
&gt; &gt;suspension.
&gt; &gt;   Also visible are small gray specs of corrosion on the aluminum
&gt; &gt;(not  visible in jar 1 perhaps due to the thick coating of flakes).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;3 &amp; 4. No discernable precipitate or cloudiness. Aluminum surface
&gt; &gt;still as satiny as when first polished.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So jars 3 &amp; 4 proves what we all know already, that antifreeze
&gt; &gt;prevents corrosion. Only time will tell whether my use of an 
&gt; &gt;antifreeze which probably has phosphates will make any difference. 
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, I don't have phosphate-free antifreeze to use for a 5th jar.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, jars 1 and 2 behave the opposite as I would have expected.
&gt; &gt;Any chemists out there to explain why using distilled water produced more
&gt; &gt;precipitate than tap water?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is actually an interesting question from a chemistry
&gt;           point of view. Being an analytical chemist and not a
&gt;           inorganic chemist this is not my direct forte. I will give
&gt;           my attempt at an explanation.
&gt; 
&gt;           Here goes; First we need to think about what corrosion is to
&gt;           understand the chemistry involved. Corrosion, as used in
&gt;           this E-Mail, would be the oxidation of metals to form metal
&gt;           salts and  precipitates. Different metals will oxidize to
&gt;           form different metal salts. Rust is the classic oxidation
&gt;           product of Iron.
&gt; 
&gt;           For those who forgot their general chemistry oxidation is
&gt;           the loss of electrons. This is promoted by what is called a
&gt;           oxidizing agent. An oxidizing agent is something that wants
&gt;           an electron or is electron deficient. Chlorine (Cl) is one
&gt;           of the best oxidizing agents there is. Cl is one electron
&gt;           short of a full electron state.  So it will take an electron
&gt;           from anywhere it can.
&gt; 
&gt;           Next we must look at what metals come in contact with the
&gt;           coolant to figure out what things may be corroded. In most
&gt;           cars that would be Iron (Fe), Aluminum (Al), and steel
&gt;           (which is a blend of Fe, Carbon, and other metals, like
&gt;           Nickel (Ni) and Chromium (Cr). Any of these can be oxidized.
&gt; 
&gt;           Al is easily oxidized, more so then Fe or steel. The reason
&gt;           that Al looks dull is the surface is oxidized and this
&gt;           prevents further oxidation. If you polish Al it will oxidize
&gt;           immediately and if you continue to polish it will continue
&gt;           to oxidize.
&gt; 
&gt;           Now to the heart of the matter. Why did they Al in distilled
&gt;           water oxidize more then in tap? The answer is that distilled
&gt;           water is more reactive then tap water. This is because in
&gt;           distilled water you need to think of the water as a lose
&gt;           association of H+ and 2O- ions. These ions can react or
&gt;           oxidize metals. Tap water has other ions like (Fe3+, Mg3+,
&gt;           Fe2+, Ca2+, Cl-, F-).  These ions will form lose
&gt;           associations with the H+ and the O- and make the water less
&gt;           reactive.
&gt; 
&gt;           The bottom line is that you should use antifreeze and tap
&gt;           water as your coolant. Antifreeze is designed to help
&gt;           prevent corrosion. At some other time I can talk about what
&gt;           is in antifreeze and how it works.
