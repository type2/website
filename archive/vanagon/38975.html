&gt;So I'm looking at something like $5,000 to bring this 11 year old, 160,000 mile

Here is my philosophy on this. Ask yourself two questions?
Where could I get a van in this condition with a new engine for $5000?
Would I buy a van in this condition with a new engine?
If the answer is you couldn't get one like this for $5000, or you would buy
one if you could for $5000, then fix it.
When thinking about if you can get, and would buy another van, it helps
remove the emotional attachment. You aren't thinking about YOUR BABY,
but some stange van owned by some stranger. This lets you be more objective.
