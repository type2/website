We rented a 89 VW Joker turbodiesel Westfalia Camper 4 years ago in
Munich. I loved it. Plenty of power and great fuel economy. Diesel fuel is
also quite a bit cheaper than gasoline in Europe.  Drove to Turkey and
back without it missing a beat. 

Why didn't VW ever offer the TD van/camper in North America?

Thought about converting a gasoline engined Camper to turbodiesel.
BMW made a turbodiesel unit for the '85 Lincoln that should fit.
Rover makes some bullet-proof turbodiesels for the LandRover. They have   
exceptional power/displacement.

Anybody do such a conversion?
