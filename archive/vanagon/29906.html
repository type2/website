Subject: '71 Westy tranny leak

Hi all!

Got a couple of questions to throw out to the list:

1.  The last time I adjusted my valves I was checking my CV boots and noticed 
that the r/h side of the tranny was fairly wet where the axle exits. Is there 
a seal there that can be replaced while the tranny is still installed? Or am 
I looking at pulling the tranny for service?
2.  Does any one know the location of a source for a replacement ice-box for 
a '71? Mine is in so-so condition. It seems that most substitutes I have 
located are about 2-3&quot; too wide.

Thanks!
