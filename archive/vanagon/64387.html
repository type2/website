Subject:      camping contacts??

we've been listing the California Camping Crazies (so aptly named!!) for
a long time on the Weakly Statz, and i've begun to wonder if any other
parts of the country would care to be listed ...

that is, anybody else wanna be a &quot;Camping Contact&quot;?? i.e., the person to
whom the potential camper would email for info on the latest/greatest
campout info in the near future?? in THAT contact-person's area.

for example, Dave Easterwood has &quot;volunteered&quot; ;) to be such a person in
the Northern Georgia/Northeastern Alabama/Eastern Tennesee/Western North
Carolina area (the foothills of the Appalachians). and i think i can con
... er, convince, that is! ... Poor Richard to be a Contact Person for
another part of North Carolina.

so what does it mean?? what do you have to do?? well ... sorta be a go-
between/info-pimp. ;) if Bubba's Buses is having a campout at the mud pond
down the road, and anyone is invited, then announce it on the list or if
someone emails you and asks &quot;when's the next campout/get-together??&quot;,
send them the info on Bubba and his bunch. that sort of thing. if you have
a web page and can devote space to such goings-on, i can post that URL in
the Weakly Statz, otherwise, i'll just post your email address (well, you ARE
gonna &quot;volunteer&quot;, aren't you?? :)

it's not forever, and if it gets to be too much email/chore/aggrevation, then
you are not bound or obligated, etc., etc., etc. but be sure to let me know
so i can remove your info!! and you'll likely still get email for a time,
until it kinda filters away. it WILL likely increase your email volume, so
be sure your ISP allows you enough extra (without any additional charges!).

any takers?? :)
