Is there a trick to this? I tried a few weekends ago and I couldn't get
the resin core solder to flow into the crimped connections. Yes they were
dirty, but I tried to clean them the best I could with contact cleaner. I
have heard of people using acid flux, but I worry about residual flux
corroding the wire.
