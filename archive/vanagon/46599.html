&gt;  On the weekend of May 19, we took an
&gt; overnight trip in our camper up into the mountains along the Sea-to-Sky
&gt; highway north of Vancouver.  At about 8:15 am the next morning, a few
&gt; hundred million pounds of rock slid off the slope above the highway south
&gt; of us, burying the highway under 50 feet of rock and cutting us off from
&gt; Vancouver.
&gt; 
&gt; We spent that day doing what any young couple in a VW camper would do when
&gt; marooned up in the mountains, cut-off from the city and unable to report
&gt; for work.  Oh, and it was a looong day!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, sure, we would have conceived sooner or later, some place or other, but

Well then I guess I can forgive you for missing that VW show in North Van after all.

Congrats!
