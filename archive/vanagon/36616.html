Subject: Re: 68 vw bus $550 runs &amp; looks great (Concord, Bay Area)

Okay, since this subject spawned 'something completely different' I thought
it only fair to give you guys an update -

Checked it out Monday night.  Seemed fine.  Scootched all around with
flashlight, etc etc.  Seemed okay.

Verified this is a 1968-69 Engine (COOOOOOOOL).  This is a '68 and am
restoring a '69 so most of the parts will interchange.

Called the DMV.  Hmmmmm, it has had three DPOs!  Two of which had it
registered under 'AND' so I have to make sure both signed the title.  There
was an internediary owner as well as the current owner.  Ugh.  SOOOOOOOO, I
contemplated this...

I called the guy back.  He does not have the smog (he officially is a
dealer) but offered a $50 discount.

I figure it this way - I am going to morrow to check the compression.  If
is ANYWHERE near acceptable AND i can drive it back it is MINE. Soooooo,
will keep you informed.  Hopefully the 90 mile trip back will not be a
nightmare!

-Marlin
'69 Westy (in progress)
'68 Deluxe (soon, very soon)

P.S.  Is there anything (in addition to the Bible's reccomendations) that I
should take with me?
