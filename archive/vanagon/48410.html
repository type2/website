Richard,

Let me weigh in here and also concur with our &quot;ferret-miester's&quot; opinion.

THe Weekender package is pretty rare, and quite frankly, unless your parents 
are going to be sleeping four in the EV, the Weekender package really 
doesn't make sense. My major criticism of the Weekender is the &quot;cooler&quot; 
under the rear passenger seat...

First off, it holds no more than a six-pack and a couple of sandwiches, 
second, that particular seat is bolted to the floor, as opposed to the quick 
release mechanism found on the other middle seat, or both middle seats in 
the regular MV version. Within a couple of minutes you can remove the two 
middle seats and have a fairly large carying area...or even a bit more room 
when you are camping.

When we go camping, or on a long trip, we remove the passenger side middle 
seat and replace it with one of those electronic coolers, held in place with 
the seatbelt. At night we remove it and plug in the 110v adapter.

As was mentioned before, the MV has the same bed as the Weekender, as well 
as curtains, and the flourescent light.

If you have any other questions, e-mail me.

Ric
