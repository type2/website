So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, my motor is back in, but I can't get it to run well.  I set the timing 
&gt; at notch, I think 7 degrees after TDC, and here the engine had a hard time 

It's suppose to be 7 and 1/2 degrees BEFORE TDC (static)!!!!

&gt; starting, and seems to be running hot.  The brand new extractor system 
&gt; already has all it's paint burned off.  I'm coming from a real disadvantage 

With the distributor advanced that far, I'm not suprised it was getting so
hot.

&gt; 1) 1600 dp with a 009 and 34-pict-3 carb.  The crank pulley has a TDC mark, 
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is was told me where the timing should be.
