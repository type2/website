Subject: Belated Intro

OK, here's my wandering tale.  I haven't always been at Bus Boys (only took
it over a couple a years ago).  Been into VWs since the early '60s.  Have a
'62 Bug my father bought new that was traded in '67 for a '67 Deluxe 21 Wdw
Sunroof which I still have (and is undergoing it's 3rd restoration).  The
reason why I have the '62 is that 17 years later I traced it to the third
owner and bought back for a few hundred dollars and it's gonna been redone
too - got losta color photos of when we first owned it for a perfect resto
guide.  After stint with Uncle Sam, I went into the Foreign Auto parts
business workin' the counter, but my first love was and still is VWs.  Bought
a little VW parts place in Van Nuys in '82 called Sherwood Automotive Parts,
then a couple a years later I bought the Old Volks Home, ya know, the company
that invented the &quot;Cal Look&quot; (yeah I know &quot;Cow Look&quot;) Window Rubber and also
made a lot of replacement window rubber for Bugs and Buses as well.  Still
have the company, but I mostly wholesale in quantity to Bus Boys and the
competition these days.  For side work, I do computer stuff, such as
accounting software support and desktop publishing.  For those out there who
have the West Coast Metric Watercooled Catalog, I'm the one who put that
fiasco together - took over two years on my overworked PC to do it.  Anyway,
my chance to get outa smoggy LA and buy into Bus Boys and run the place is
where I'm at now.  Sometimes I wish I was still workin' outa the house tho'.
 I also own a Vanagon (80) that serves as the parts hauler and sometimes
camper.  I'm spendin' most of my days answering a ton a phone calls at BBI
and workin' 18 hour days.

Gotta Love It :)
