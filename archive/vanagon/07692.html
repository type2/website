Subject: Re: Warmer bus talk


&gt;&gt;     With all this talk of partitions between cab and back area, I've gotta 
&gt;&gt;     tell you about my mates panel van. It's a '66 Panel with twin sliding 
&gt;&gt;     doors (ooo, rare) and has a factory fitted partition between the cab 
&gt;&gt;     and the loading area. It looks something like:
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;       _____________
&gt;&gt;     /     ____     \ 
&gt;&gt;     |    |____|    |
&gt;&gt;     |              |
&gt;&gt;      -------------- 
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     Yep that's a little window to see through as well. It's the only one 
&gt;&gt;     I've seen but it's genuine. I figure you can make one from some 
&gt;&gt;     hardboard (you know the 3 mm thick cardboard stuff that the door 
&gt;&gt;     panels are made from), cut a hole for a window, and perhaps nail some 
&gt;&gt;     upright wood to it for rigidity. I've got a spare rear hatch glass 
&gt;&gt;     which would make a cool window, just use a window rubber out of a 
&gt;&gt;     bread-loaf bus that had NONE-factory side windows - the ones that 
&gt;&gt;     stick out.
&gt;
&gt;Thats what mine looked like, but I made mineout of canvas, without the 
&gt;window.  I think early panel busses all came with these.  Even the
&gt;model panel I have has it!

Early bench seat Panel Vans optionally came with a cab divider made of
masonite chipboard with a fixed piece of glass to see thru to the rear.
(My '61 double door panel is a walk-thru, so it doesn't have a divider)
Early Ambulances came with a similar cab divider but had a larger
sliding glass divider in them.

POP QUIZ!
Q: How can you tell the difference between a bench seat and walk-thru
   panel van from the outside?
A: Bench seat models had additional vents at the top rear of the sides
   right below the rain gutter above the fresh air vents for the engine
   compartment.  The reason for this is because if a cab divider was
   installed there would otherwise be no other way to get fresh air
   into the cargo area.

BTW, I would love to see a double sliding door '66 panel.  I have only
seen one sliding door split.
