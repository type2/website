Subject:      OH NO!!- Fuel gauge stuck at Full

     List members -

     My trusty Westy Syncro developed one of its first problems.  After
     filling up with gas in Hayward, Wisconsin (slow fill) on Sunday and
     driving for 100 miles back home the fuel gauge stayed at full.  When I
     turn the Westy off the gauge does drop to Empty.  After restarting,
     the gauge goes to full.  I know that my Westy Syncro has been a
     constant 20 m.p.g. vehicle.

     I haven't had the time (have to work on Monday) to check it out.  Has
     any one had this problem?  I'm going home after work Monday to look
     this over, any words of wisdom would be appreciated.
