Subject: leaking torque converter oil seal?
Date: Mon, 10 Mar 1997 23:29:57 -0600

Vanagoners:

	A warm springlike Sunday in Mobile, what do I do?  Crawl under the van,
looking for trouble instead of just waiting for it to show up! No coolant,
no oil :)  Only gunk and grease appear to be coming from the &quot;cage&quot;
between the final drive (it's an automatic) and the engine. 
	Bentley, page 32.3,shows Converter oil seal (figure 7). This looks like a
suspect. The &quot;stuff&quot; appears thicker than engine oil and is NOT leaving
spots on the driveway. 
	Does anybody have any experience with this torque converter oil seal?
