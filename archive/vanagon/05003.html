&gt; 
&gt; ok, ok. i got it!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; the first generation was called Bulli (which had something to do with a
&gt; german slang name for an ox or draught-horse (that's work-horse to you
&gt; Yanks).
&gt; 
&gt; the second generation was called Bus or Bread-loaf (cause it looked like
&gt; that dancing loaf of bread in the commercials) or Bay-Window (because of
&gt; the huge single piece windshield).
&gt; 
&gt; the third generation was called Vanagons (cause of a bunch of stupid
&gt; advertising twits) or Bricks (cause of the squared-off shaped resemblance
&gt; to said construction material).
&gt; 
&gt; so ... what distinguishes the fourth generation from the others? it PULLS!!!
&gt; so it's a Puller. or Pulley. or Pulli. :)
&gt;

Aha! puli, n., a long-haired sheepdog of a Hungarian breed (Amer. Heritage
Dictionary). I once knew one; it was the noisiest yap dog I've ever met.
