&gt;high mucky mucks from VW corporate (Germany) had been there (Carter VW in
&gt;Seattle) to discuss future product plans. One thing they mentioned was the
&gt;possiblity of a Syncro Eurovan for 96. While I doubt that I'll be in the
&gt;market for one (too mini-van like, yet too big for me), I'm sure this will
&gt;tantalize some readers.

&gt;Paul

consensus of the european off-road press, which has tested the syncro 
eurovan, is that the new vehicle is less off road capable than the Vanagon
syncro.
