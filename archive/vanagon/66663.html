 have jumped into his Vanagon to run to the store for a six-pack so he
 could work on his engine and got nailed at the intersection...could
 happen! Then again, he might have just kept going...

I agree.  In fact, I was probably guilty of the same thing several weeks ago
when I made an unscheduled 3 week vacation with no way to connect to the
Internet and then had to send my lap-top in for repair.  Lucky for me, I
installed my Browser on my AutoCAD Workstation and bought a new modem to keep
in touch while the lap-top took a repair trip to California.......  It's
still not back!!!   Could happen to anyone!
