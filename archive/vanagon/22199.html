Subject: 86 Vanagon Speakers

Hello All,

I have a 86 Vanagon and the front speakers are blown. The trick is the
speaker plate has to be flush on the interior door so the window crank can
work (all other speakers I can find have a raised speaker plate about 1/4
to 1/2 inches). Any thoughts on replacements?
