 Does anyone need a front beam for a 70' bus

 I have a good one in my garage.. I wanted to see if I could
 find it a new home..

 No rust, no spindles, good ball joints

 I have more late bus stuff, but i have to find it
 I keep tripping over this beam, so its on my mind every day..

 let me know....
