&lt;&lt; Does anyone have knowledge as to where I could purchase a set of wire or
 Lexan headlight covers for the square headlamps on an '87 Vanagon?  I
 have replaced two this year due to rock damage at a cost of $111.00
 each. Any possible resources would be helpful.  &gt;&gt;

Try Ron Salmon's Bus Depot at: www.busdepot_dot_com
or JCWhitney.  Both have them.
