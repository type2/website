&gt;&gt; -10   - German cars don't start
&gt;&gt;           Eyes freeze shut when you blink
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;The term &quot;German Cars&quot; obviously does not extend to VW busses...mine 
started
&gt;(albeit slightly reluctantly) at -14F last week.  I will concede, however,
&gt;that my eylids DID freeze shut when I blinked, which made for an extremely
&gt;interesting ride to work!  ;-)

Just turn on the heater!

Heh-heh... heh-heh...
