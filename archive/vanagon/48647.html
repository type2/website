Subject: Propane blues

Hello again...  I've discovered that our 88 Westy, Moo, has an older liquid
propane gas connector and was chagrined to find that it no longer works
properly.  Apparently there is a button on the side of the unit that has to
be pressed if the flow is &quot;not at all&quot; or &quot;restricted&quot;. On holidays the
best I could do was a whopping three litres pumped into the 12 litre tank.
That button's red rubber cover was still in place but apparently not air or
water tight.  The button is gunked up.  I've been trying to loose it with
liquid wrench, spraying the stuff from the outside on to the button, but so
far no joy.

I've been told that 200 dollars will fix it all up with A newer unit, but
I'm wondering if there's a cheaper soloution to unstick my button?

HELP please...
