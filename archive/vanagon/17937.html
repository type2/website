Subject: Re: Dictionary needed

&gt;Can someone clue me in on what a &quot;type II&quot; is ?
&gt;
&gt;I suspect that there are &quot;body type I, II, III...&quot; and
&gt;&quot;engine type I, II, III, IV, ...&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I can see that I have to build a table of engine types versus model
&gt;years to keep this straight. &quot;I am only an egg.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I think the original distiction was between the &quot;small window Bug = type I&quot;
&gt;body, and &quot;Split screen breadbox = type II&quot; body. But there seem to be many
&gt;more variations to account for.
&gt;

Type II is a Bus ofter called a breadbox or upside-down bathtub or the best
ride on four wheels!
