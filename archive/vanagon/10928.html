Back 2 Basics
Facts and Figures by Keith Seume
Volksworld, Winter 1994

With the current upsurge of interest in early Type 2s, we thought it
timely to take a look at some facts and figures relating to chassis
numbering of these vehicles.  In addition, we'll take a look at the
various colour combinations that were offered and the numerious model
options that were available to the would be buyer.

Restoring any old vehicle to original specification can be difficult
but, where Type 2s are concerned, the problem is compounded by the fact
that many such VWs were modified throughout their working life.  A good
example is something like Peter Nicholson's old Grossraum Kastenwagen
... that's a high-top van to the English-speaking world ... that we
featured in Volksworld's Issue No. 4.  It began life as a workhorse
without any side windows or interior fitments, would have been painted
blue and almost certainly have been purchased by a clothing retailer who
needed a high roofed van to carry dresses on hangers.  When the van was
rediscovered, it had been repainted numerous times and converted into a
camper, with windows fitted to each side and a home-built interior.

A look through the files shows that the vehicle was a model 211 (VW
delivery van with double doors on right, LHD), equipped with option
M222 (high roof delivery van).  It had also been fitted with M175
(export bumper guards), M502 (lining - side panel, hardboard) and M75
(mudflaps).  The original colour was L31 Dove Blue.

This is just a single example of the endless hours of fun you can have
by identifying what options your old Kombi or pick up might have been
fitted with at the factory.  However, to start with, let's take a look
at the various model designations offered by the factory up until the
end of 1967, the last of the &quot;Splits&quot;.

MISSING LINKS
You will notice from this list that there is a certain logic about the
numbering, but that same logic leads you to realise that there are some
obvious omissions from the range. For example, there is not model 222
which would surely have been a RHD Micro Bus with the double doors on
the right? Clearly the factory did not feel there was a market for such
a vehicle and consequently didn't offer one in its line up.  However,
the gap in the model numbers suggests that it might have been open to
persuasion at a later date.

CHASSIS NUMBERS
So to chassis numbers. Successful use of VW parts listings depends upon
the customer knowing the chassis number for his or her vehicle and
identifying the true age of a Type 2 is similarly reliant on this
information. The chassis number of a split-screen Type 2 is located in
one of four places according to age:

Up to chassis number 20-117 901 (March 1955) it can be found on the
vertical surface to the right of the engine.

&gt;From chassis number 20-117 902 until chassis number 469 505 (June 1959)
it is above or below the identification plate on the vertical surface
to the right of the engine.

&gt;From chassis number 469 506 until chassis number 1 200 097 (late 1963)
it can be found on the engine cover plate in the engine compartment
(adjacent to the battery).

&gt;From chassis number 1 200 098 (late 1963 onwards) the chassis number
can be found located on the identification plate situated on the right
hand side of the air duct.

TAKE NOTE
Notice how the numbering system changed in format over the years. The
first change was made for the 1956 model year and the second in August
1964. The list that follows shows chassis numbers at the end of each
production year.  The monthly entries relate to a significant model
change that year (for example, fitting larger engine).

COLOURS GALORE
When it came to colour choice, the Type 2 has always fared well compared
to other commercial vehicles, with a reasonably wide range of paint and
trim colours being available.  Models 211-216, 231-238 and 261-274 were
only available in a single body colour, whereas models 221-228, 241-251,
281 and 285 were sold with two tone paint schemes.

Some of the colour combinations on the two-tone models have become
classics in their own right ... who can deny that an early bus in two-
tone Sealing Wax Red and Chestnut Brown looks absolutely beautiful?

Remember, all commercials came unpainted on the internal bodywork:
greyish primer is all you got from the factory.

When you ordered your basic Type 2, it was possible to specify a
multitude of options, ranging numerically from M16 (pick-up with double
cab) to M623 (fully suppresed electrical equipment for police use).
In between was a whole host of options which could be ordered thereby
transforming the bare VW into what amounted to a custom-built vehicle.
However, not all options were available in every market or on every type
vehicle. After all, you could hardly order a high-roofed delivery van
option for your pick-up.  Here then is the full range of options ...
or 'M' numbers that could be specified on pre-'68 Type 2s.

If this doesn't keep you occupied for a few minutes, nothing will!
Happy Hunting.
