Subject: Great Drives

I'd like to announce a &quot;Great Drives&quot; site!  About a year and half  ago I 
began to formulate this idea of having scenic or challenging drives 
written up and made available via the web.  Since I've recently got 
my BMW Resource Page up, I decided to work on the Great Drives Page.

Anyone and everyone is encouraged to visit and hopefully contribute 
your favorite drive.

You can reach the page thru either of the following:

http://users.why_dot_net/ajax/bmw.htm
http://users.why_dot_net/ajax/gdrives.htm

Feedback and suggestions are, of course, welcome and encouraged!
