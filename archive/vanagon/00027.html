Subject: Any A/C Secrets?

Hi all,

My father and I are in the process of replacing the a/c compressor and redoing
the hoses for the compressor.  This 85 Vanagon has an a/c system that was 
installed after getting of the boat.  It has the cooling unit mounted on the
ceiling just behind the front seats with the front vents and switches where
the visors are placed.  I have work on this unit several times through out the
years trying to keep us cool from spring to fall.  (We live in south Georgia,
btw.)  I have all the windows behind the front seats tinted with 20% film.
I have taped up all cracks and gaps inside cooling unit using duct tape
(I guess over time it has warped.)  Even with a fresh charge of freon it does
not seem to keep us cool.  Cold air does come out of the vents but I suppose
that the unit it too small for what it is designed for.

Is there anything there anything else I can do or is this a lost cause?

Thanks,

Jonathan
