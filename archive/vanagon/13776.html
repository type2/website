&gt;I AM NEW TO THIS LIST AND ALSO A NEW OWNER OF A VW, SO PLEASE FORGIVE 
&gt;ME IF MY QUESTION IS STUPID.  I JUST BOUGHT A 1975 CAMPER A FEW MONTHS
&gt;AGO AND MY QUESTION IS: WHEN I PLUG THE EXTENSION CHORD THAT COMES 
&gt;OUT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE VAN AND TURN THE AC CONVERTER SWITCH ON 
&gt;THAT IS UNDER SEAT THE RED LIGHT WILL FLICKER FOR A WHILE AND 
&gt;EVENTUALLY FADE.  I CAN PLUG APPLIANCES INTO THE ELECTRICAL SOCKET IN 
&gt;THE VAN AND THEY WILL WORK.  THE FRIDGE HOWEVER WON'T COME ON.  IS IT 
&gt;DISCONNECTED FROM THE CONVERTER SOMEWHERE?  WHERE DO I LOOK IF THIS 
&gt;IS THE CASE?  IS THE FRIDGE JUST OLD AND DEAD?

HELLO!!! CAN YOU HEAR ME?! :)

Just kidding you... I'll assume that you have a Canadian Bus (with the
retractable extension cord). I have a California '75, the Deluxe version
with electrical fridge and it does NOT work, even though the electrical
stuff is all functional (i.e., the heating element does get hot). I
believe this is because the ammonia mix is all gelified (is that a word?).
Maybe by letting the fridge run for a few days in a row, it will resume
its function as a cooler.

So try to fix your electrical problem first and check whether the heating
element is working. *Then* let it run for a couple of days. (The heating
gizmo is a small copper cylinder that you'll find behind the fridge inside
a fiberglass wool insulated tube.)

Good luck!
