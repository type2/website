&gt; 
&gt;  I think a long thin flouresent lamp and switch mounted on each side of 
&gt;the overhead storage cabinet's door handle would be nice yet minimally 
&gt;intrusive.  The electronic balast(s) would be mounter on the door's back 
&gt;side.  The following are all enabled by this installation: recomended 
&gt;over-the-shoulder reading/dining light source, high efficiency (typically 
&gt;80% light), a variety of potential color temperature lamps, and second 
&gt;position utility.  By placing the lamps high on the door's front surface, 
&gt;when the door is swung down to open, they'd also illuminate the engine 
&gt;compartment, bed reading, and the space hehind the rear hatch.
&gt;  The only item I haven't located yet is a source for tidy front bulb 
&gt;covers.  Does anyone know of a source?  Also, how's this sound?
&gt;
&gt;   Hi John:
 We had a 84 Westy, and it came with a light over and to the left the stove.
I think it was a halogen (?) light. It was very bright. You might be able to
find one in a bone yard somewhere (I've seen some). You will have no problem
reading with the light these throw out and no one would even know you made a
modification to your Westy. I wouldn't mind getting one for my 86. They
changed to a three lightbulb light and it isn,t as good.
