Subject: Anybody in Williamsburg, VA this weekend?


All of a sudden, we decided to drive to Williamsburg, VA this weekend.
Anybody on this list planning to be there? We'll be driving the '87 weekender,
license plates: ARR-0012 (PA) (dark metallic paint with a blue tint).

We're kind of planning to drive around until we find a decent Howard
johnson's or something like that.  Anybody know a good place to stay
around that part of VA?

My family will be picking me up from NJ mid-afternoon, so I will not be
able to read my e-mail until I get back.  However, if anybody has any
suggestions for a good place to stay, or would like to let us know that
they will also be there, you can send me e-mail at the address:

cetin_at_seas.bellcore_dot_com

and I will receive it before we take off...



nice weekend to all!!!
