Subject: Aircooled business sighting in MA

Hi folks,

I was up in Northfield, Mass. this past sunday to catch the tail end of the
east coast Citroen Rendezvous.  One psychedelically painted early CV was
being trailered by an 81-83 vanagon (with great art work all over it) with
Maine plates--maybe a listmember?  I left convinced that the only thing
stranger than a bunch of bus owners at a show are a bunch of citroen freaks
zipping around with their hydraulic suspensions.

On the way home we stopped off in Northampton and on route 5 on the way into
town saw a place called German Imports (at least I think it was &quot;imports&quot;)
that had a parking lot full of aircooled buses and bugs.  Saw a couple
unrestored 63-67 buses in the yard and some rusty 72-79 baywindows.  They
also had one restored day-glo green bay westy with propane setup and an
aircooled vanagon westy for sale (sorry, I didn't get the phone #).   Quite
a few neat cars in Northampton center--an unrestored Morris Minor and a fire
engine red 72 westy we saw in passing to name a couple.  

Next time I'm in the area and German Imports is open I'll stop by and give a
report.
