Joel,
Of course we knew that.  With all the time you spend producing statistics
and making copies of parts lists and mailing out fiches, you don't have any
time to go grocery shopping. :-)

Oh, by the way. The parts list came in handy yesterday when I couldn't get
to my fiche because I was watching the kids and I wanted to figure out where
the filler plug for the tranny was.  

I finally went to walmart today and bought a dwell/tach and a timing 
light.  It's nice to know that I've at least got those two right.   I can 
also really see the effect of the idle stabilizer.  When you put the 
timing light on with it plugged in, the timing wanders a lot.  Steady as 
a rock with it disconnected, though.

I'm a little nervous about this trip.  Maybe you could extract some names 
and cities of Van owners in my path.  St. Paul to Sioux City, IA, to the 
middle of Nebraska to Berthoud, CO (North of Boulder) back up to Cheyenne 
and over to Salt Lake City and north past Logan to Smithfield, UT.  Maybe 
I should post that request to the list and ask for repair kinds of people?

Yes. This message is not so personal;  it's going to the list, too.
List, if anyone is willing to take a few minutes out of their busy 
schedules and send me names and phone numbers of their favorite 
repair/parts places along that route, I'd be really grateful!
