Subject: Water tank pump shot

When we bought our 84 westy, the sink's water pump didn't work. So we 
opened up the tank and boy did it smell! The pump, it turned out, had 
burned a hole in itself. 

It is a blue cylindrical thing. Any idea how much it costs and if an 
after-market RV-type pump would work? Also, do these pumps leave any kind 
of toxic residue in the tank when they self-destruct? I've poured boiling 
water with lots of baking soda in the tank and rinsed it so that it 
doesn't smell anymore. Should I also use chlorine?

Any help is appreciated.
