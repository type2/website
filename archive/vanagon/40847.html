&gt;If hit the same, a smooth
&gt;golf ball will not travel as far as a dimpled golf ball.

&gt;tape a grid of yarn tufts on the van surface and drive at your
&gt;normal cruising speed with somebody in a vehicle beside you video taping the
&gt;behavior of the tufts in the airflow.

Once in Milwaukee I saw a Saab that was completely covered with black
Astroturf. I am not making this up, either. It looked like a very smug
rodent with wheels. At the time I thought that this was asinine but now I
realize that that Saab was a masterpiece of aerodynamic engineering, for
having copious vortices. Probably if somebody had smacked it with a
three-wood it would have flown all the way to Kenosha on very little gas.
If I'd known then what I know now...
