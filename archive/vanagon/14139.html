Subject:      12 volt to 6 volt

The following is a 12v to 6v circuit that was in the April'95 Hot VW's,
that can be used for running the wiper motor that is still 6v.
        I claim no affiliation with said Mag and I am not on there
payroll nor do I receive any fees for this.
        Just thought some of you out there that don't get the mag
would like to see this to help in a restoration that is going to
be made a 12v system from 6v.  We know how unreliable the voltage
drop things are and this seem to be a viable option.

        Here is a list of components and their description:

(R1) 240 ohm, 1/4 watt carbon resistor
(r2) 5k ohm variable resistor
(C1) 0.1 microfarad cap
(C2) 1.0 microfarad tantalum electrolytic cap (polarity observation required)
(U1) LM317T adjustable voltage regulator chip
(Q1) 2N3055 transistor, can deliver upto 8amps

        This Article was also in the Dec'94 Hot VW's Mag, but it did not
include the higher current portion of the circuit.
        If you need more info on this circuit and don't have access
to the HVW's Mag email me and I will try to type up the article for
distribution to the List.
        Sorry if the drawing is not real good but...... sirra sirra
