&gt;	My 86 has two oil pressure sensors. Did you get a flashing LED w/
&gt;buzzer? If it was just a flashing light look at the condition of the wire
&gt;coming out of the low pressure sensor, possibly melted by exhaust and
&gt;grounded out.
&gt;Good luck
&gt;ken
&gt;P.S.
&gt;Heres a synopses ..

Please be advised that the dynamic oil pressure system only exists on '86
and later Vanagons--the 1981 is only going to have one oil pressure sender
and no complicated printed circuit board with buzzer behind the speedometer
to warn you when it doesn't like the comparisons of two senders.
