&gt;wher might one look for a &quot;new&quot; 34 pict carb. i didn't know they were still
&gt;being manufactured i assumed that the &quot;new&quot; carbs were actually (factory?)
&gt;rebuilds.

I got my new 34-PICT-3 carb mailorder from NOPI (Atlanta), 800-277-NOPI.  M-F 
8:00-6:00 EST.

It's Brazilian, I think, but looks and functions just like the original Solex. 
 Hey, it works and the price was right.  I doubt whether you can still get a 
genuine Solex and even so would probably cost $500.

I think if you want one from NOPI you have to tell them you saw their ad in 
DBHVW's for $119.95.  They take all plastic and I got mine all the way in 
Washington State about 6 days after ordering.
