Gary,

The layout of the Turbo Diesel and the Non-Turbo Diesel are the
same except some specials to the turbo mounting (different exhaust
downpipe) and the additional oil cooler (but I'm not sure if this
is truly different). The oil cooler in a TD is the same style as
in the 2.1L waterboxer.

The TD is built into the Vanagon in same way as the non TD, you
have to use the same special oilpan from the Vanagon non-TD.

Special to the TD is the stronger crank and a piston floor cooling.
For more details I have to check my manual this night.

A few weeks ago I sent a table of gearboxes and their relations
to the available engines. Search the archives.

The Diesel provides 50 PS as the Turbo Diesel provides
70 PS, and, if you like to add an intercooler, around 75 PS. The
70 PS gives me a nice driving with the traffic in town and on the
Autobahn on an average speed of 130 km/h and top speed at 180 km/h.
A little bit slow is a take over on country roads. The Diesels,
both TD and non-TD, need more time to accelerate than gas engines.
But on TD you feel an additional bust at 2,800 rpm, but not as
much as on turbo gas engines because the turbo at the Diesel is
designed for better combustion and MPG.
I found, that a 95 PS Vanagon Camper accelerates faster that the
cold Golf TD (for my style of driving), and no difference when it
is warmed up.

Please, everybody feel free to add their comments an suggestions.

Will the Golf TD fit in the Vanagon?  Or does it lay to one side and have a=

special oilpan as the Vanagon diesel had.  Will it match to the transmissio=
n
or must one find the diesel transmission to match up to?  What do you
estimate the HP to be in the Golf TD?
