Subject: Cracked Syncro Clutch Housing

	Bill,
	I'm not sure how different syncros are, but I don't think
that 'the clutch housing is lubricated with gear oil' is correct.
If oil is falling out of your bell-housing/clutch-housing,
it could be either tranny or engine oil- smell should tell you-
tranny oil is, ahem, *distinctive*. But there SHOULDN'T be
either in the clutch housing. Either your front main
engine seal or transmission input shaft seal have gone
the way of all flesh, IMHO.
	But me, I'm hoping it turns out to be a loose
screw somewhere and it just looks like its coming out of
the bellhousing. :)

	All theory, I've only every owned aircooled.

	Bill A.
