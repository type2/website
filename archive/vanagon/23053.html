Subject: VW-WHY JERRY'S VW HEAVEN IS MORE LIKE DANTE'S INFERNO

This little note probably has zero meaning to anyone living outside of
Southern California so if that applies to you, go to the next email....



My 71 Bus was exhibiting signs that it was time for a transplant.  I was
dripping a quart of black gold between fillups, the &quot;power&quot; factor had
dropped off of late, and it had been 100k miles and five years since the
last rebuild.  Since I suspected that the oil loss was not of the
easy-to-fix variety (wasn't push rod tubes, cooler, front main seal,
etc.), I figured that it was just as much work to do another long block
exchange rather than finding the source of, and thereafter fixing, the
problem.  The engine was an ATK (the Santa Ana, CA rebuilder) and since I
had gotten 100k trouble-free miles (the leak notwithstanding), I wanted
another one.  For those of you who don't know them, ATK does a very good
rebuild and is famous for their quality.  I think you get a 3 year/ 36k
warranty if you get it straight from them these days.

I called Jerry's VW Heaven (AKA Vee Dub Heaven) in Culver City.  I asked
if they had an ATK-made 1600 long block for a 71 transporter.  Yes.
Price? $399.  Are you sure it's an ATK.  Oh yeah.  I told him that was
pretty low since I think I paid about $600 for the ATK back in 1990 from
Jerry's.  Well, he said, that's what they cost now.  I figured that VW
engine rebuilds, like computers and bicycles, go down in price over time
(L.A has a million rebuild shops and the competition is pretty fierce).
Are you sure it's for a Bus?  Oh yeah.  I drive down there and again ask
if this is an ATK.  Yep.  Bus?  Yep.  Dual port?  Yep.  I noticed that it
was pretty dirty and that it wasn't in a box and wrapped in plastic like
the previous one from ATK.  I pointed this out to the gentleman who said
that they get truckloads of them and they aren't always in a box.  As we
are ringing it up, I asked for the ATK warranty materials (I had gotten
some glossy documentation and instructions before).  He said I need only
call them (ATK) after installation and that they (ATK) would send me what
I needed.  Sounded pretty simple.

I get home last night and stupidly decide that I'll yank the old one, swap
the gismos and shrouding, and stick the new one with enough time to get
some sack time before work.  Everything progresses well until I decide to
start putting on the rear engine mount bar at about 3:00am.  Of course,
the engine is a Bug engine and doesn't have the proper holes.  Grrrr. (but
I probably should have insured that myself rather than relying on the
salesperson's word).

This morning I wake up and just before leaving the house to exchange the
engine or get one of those adapters, I decide to call ATK to get the
warranty work started.  After some discussion, it turns out that my new
engine could not possibly be a real ATK.  For one thing, an ATK 1600
(really almost a new engine rather than a rebuild) now costs around $900!
Second, it didn't come in a box like all of their engines do.  Third, it
lacked the ATK serial number plate that is fastened to the engine just
under the oil filler tube stand (over the VW serial number).  ATK is going
to look into this next week.

When I call Jerry's I initially got a song and dance about their
&quot;exchange&quot; policy.  I finally convinced them that I wasn't interested in
an exchange, rather, I wanted my money back.  Oh no, can't do that.  Yeah,
right....  They finally agreed when I showed up there but then, if you can
believe this, started to make noises about the fact that the engine was
dirty and that the refund didn't apply to already installed motors.  I
implored the guy not to screw around with a very tired and cranky
ex-lawyer.  That seemed to work.  AFter some more muttering, I was told,
and will believe it when I see it, that my credit card account will be
credited.

This is my fourth experience with Jerry's that wasn't satisfactory.
First, I had bought a &quot;new&quot; Weber carb whose electromagnetic cut-off
literally fell out because the screw-in hole had had one of those helicoil
inserts (so much for being a new carb...).  Gas leaked, but when I took it
in a week after purchase, they would not give me a refund since I lost my
reciept.  Grrrrr.  But hey, it was a learning experience.  Next time when
my clutch cable began to fray, I bought a replacement cable that I was
assured would fit a 71 Bus.  When it finally did go out late one night, I
got covered with grease along the Hollywood Freeway only to learn that the
cable was for a '67 or earlier.  Grrrrr.  When my I decided to replace the
clutch a year or two ago, I bought the complete kit including the throw
out bearing (after being assured that it would fit a '71).  After pulling
the engine (my only transporation when my wife uses the Fiat), I learned
that he had given me parts for the old style (1970 and earlier).  Grrrr.
So where do I go when I decide to get a long block?  You guessed.  What a
moron I am.

So here's the bottom line.  I can understand the rare wrong part but this
place, based on the few times I've been there, is way off the scale.  Much
more ominously, they knowningly mis-represented the manufacturer of the
engine in order to make a sale.  Last time I check the California Penal
Code, this was called fraud.  And friends, that's enough to put the joint
on my enemies list.

Gotta go.  I've got a clean long block from Steve's in Downey (a short 45
mile drive from my house in really rotten traffic) for about $50 that I'm
going to spend the evening installing.  Wish me luck and for God's sake,
and your own, don't go to Jerry's Vee Dub Heaven for anything, anytime.

Just my $.02.  Thanks for listening to me whine.


Nick
