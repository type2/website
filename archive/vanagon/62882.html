Subject: Re: fit stereo in dash, 83.5 Westy?
Date: Wed, 16 Jul 1997 00:58:28 -0500

&gt;Hello-
&gt;
&gt;Next snag. I just spoke with Crutchfield, the car stereo people, and found
&gt;out there is limited space in the Vanagon dash for audio equipment. They list
&gt;the depth ot the hole in the dash at 6 1/4&quot; while most stereos are 6 1/2&quot; to
&gt;6 3/4&quot; deep.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone fit a deeper unit than the 6 1/4&quot; in the dash. I've got an
&gt;aftermarket Sony in there now which is exactly 6 1/4&quot; deep and it butts up
&gt;against a bracket in the back (which is actually the front of the vehicle). I
&gt;want to upgrade the system to one with a detachable face for anti-theft
&gt;protection. Is there a trick to getting a deeper unit in? Or does anyone know
&gt;of a detachable face CD unit that fits?
&gt;

Hey Jeff:

Since you were so helpful with my lug bolt saga I thought I'd second some
of the advise you've already gotton on your last three posts: re. FI fixed,
if you've alread replaced the cap and wires I'll bet you noticed a decided
improvement, re. tach for clock swap, yep' it's as easy and he sez it is,
and re. the tight radio space, I to have a Blaupunct, mine just fits, mine
does not have a removable face plate but I know they make one that does.

ps: I have a fifteen year old son who wants to be and actor, and I,bein an
artist neab to give him every encoragement and opportunity. I let him read
about the POV technique and he is aking it a Summer project, thanks again.

RC
