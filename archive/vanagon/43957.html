&gt; I am new to this list.  I wish I had known it existed a year ago. I have
a
&gt; 86 Westy with what seems to be an airflow problem.  I bought the $100
add-in
&gt; harness for the air flow meter but it did no good.  I get loss of power
and
&gt; black smoke from the exhaust.  If I turn off the key and reset the
computer
&gt; while driving, everything goes back to normal for a while.  The problem
&gt; always returns in 30 seconds to 1 week.
&gt; 
&gt; Spraying the connectors with silicon seems to help for a short while. 
What
&gt; is my problem?  What measurements can I make?  I don't think that I have
a
&gt; problem that others have not encountered.  I saw a reference in another
post
&gt; to an air flow problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I am going on a trip in 10 days, and need your HELP!!!!!!

Bill, 

I've got a '86 westie with the exact same problem(black smoke and all).  I
have seen a few posts with almost the same problem. I have been hoping
someone could point me in the right direction.  I think it is a
temperature sensor that  is bad because it runs good when cold (first 5
miles or so).
