Subject: 64 project for sale

I have finally decided to sell my project bus that just never seemed to 
really get started.  As much as I dreamed of one day driving it restored, 
reality is that I don't have the money, don't plan on having the money any 
time soon, and I finally pulled it out of my shed to make room for my 
priority interest, setting up my woodshop so I no longer have to work for 
another screwed up company again.  Anyhow, about the bus; I bought it 
several years ago, and had to replace the wheel cylinder and brake shoes to 
get it on the road.  I drove it around for about a year, short runs out and 
about.  It is still 6-volt, so eventually I had to park on a hill to start 
it.  I drove it for the last time to our house we bought in March 94.  I 
finally had a place to work on it, so I removed the interior, lights, motor, 
windows, with all intention of starting the resto.  Then our son was born, 
and money situation has gone steadily south.  The bus is semi put back 
together(windows back on, interior phsically inside bus).  The motor is 
still in my shed.  It is 100% complete, able to roll(tow). 

The bus I believe would be considered a Kombi.  Bench up front, no headliner 
behind seat.  It had a table/bench set-up in back that could be dropped into 
a bed, but no other camper ammenities.  I almost forgot to mention the 
factory safari's.

The bus is definately in need of major overhaul.  Has a cancer problem in 
floor, but not sure how extensive it is.

Asking price: $550/best offer.  The bus is located in northern Maryland.  
Please e-mail me directly, as I never have time to read the VANAGON digest 
anymore.
