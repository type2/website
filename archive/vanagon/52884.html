Subject: High speed miss

Last night while driving on the highway my engine cut out for a second or
two, I was turning about 4000 rpm. It felt like the igniton was turned off,
this has happened twice before in the last six months. There were no
indications before or after. This is an '87 Syncro. Anybody have any ideas?

Thanks

Derek
