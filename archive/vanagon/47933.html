Subject: Digital format 'Bentley' project (longish)

Hi Folks,

This is a proposal to generate the V_at_L digital equivalent to the Bentley 
Vanagon manual.  It would be an undertaking that marks the list as an 
entity, the publishing of a book.  Such a digital manual then needs to be 
made available on a website.  We number almost 300 owners, all in need of a 
solid affordable repair/reference manual, and we're all computer geeks 
(err... more or less, you decide :) ).  I welcome all feedback on this idea, 
best off/on list?, and I will summarise after a couple of weeks. And the 
project would also be dropped if enough negative comments came back, or for 
lack of interest.
 
        What I propose is that as many interested/willing/able members as 
possible each pick a section of the table of contents of Bentley/Haynes/?? 
manual and compile the information in digital format.  Copyright 
infringement is to be avoided!  This would be done by using our own 
illustrations, either fresh video'd/photo-scanned or drawn by hand/CAD and 
our own text, encompassing both the details in the main manuals plus the V_at_L 
'practical' experience.  Think of the existing manuals as templates, we need 
to cover the same material and more, but in our own 'style'.  The sections 
chosen should be ones which the writer has had some working exposure to, 
and/or is about to undertake and can vid/photo the stages. Big difference 
between working on a sparkling fresh new vanagon like Bentley, and one with 
10+ years of wear and tear all over.

        I see a lot of repeat advice, or referrals to the archives for help, 
while having a website repair manual 24hrs a day would really boost the 
selfhelp level before the list was asked for the really nasty details. I try 
to help off-list, so I wonder how many others are doing the same, at the 
same time.   Stuff like Westy fridges is not even in the manuals, so we can 
address sections the 'market' needs, not just what is in the manuals.

        Given so many list members the work could be well spread out, and 
the amount of work required to do one short section isn't too daunting, 
perhaps 3-5 pages worth of copy/illus.  The nice thing also is that the 
sections can be put up when ready, and subject to review too.  The most 
crucial item would seem to be the FI system (like Raid, stops'em dead!), and 
the tips this list provides just don't appear in any manuals.  A buyers 
inspection guide with illustrations would help a lot of wannabussers too.  
Ditto for body repairs.

        Any thoughts on this? If it meets with general approval then I will 
type in a table of contents similar to Bentley and interested parties could 
sign up to produce a section.  Once that's worked out, just proceed at your 
own pace, as individuals or in groups.  Having a Bentley or other for 
reference would help, but we can be pretty innovative at times. :)  Any 
offers for a home for the Digital V_at_L Manual would be welcome, or tell me 
how I can best set it up here.  I have ready access to hardware for loading 
VHS/8/Hi-8 video/frames into PCs or for flatbed scanning, but I don't use it 
often (enough), here's a chance. Java Ho?
