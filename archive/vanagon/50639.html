RE:	Copy of: RE: Bus drivers and waving.

Chrysler invented the&quot;minivan&quot; name, but VW invented the minivan concept, back
in 1950.
And, I usually get BLASTED by my splittie friends if I mistakenly call my
Vanagon a    &quot;Bus&quot;, so I just call it a Van, which is easy enough to say for me,
and afterall, thats what it is.
