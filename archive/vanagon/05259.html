&gt; This morning, when I needed to rush off to Hull across the Ottawa river
&gt; and get there in 15 minutes, the westfalia would of course not start. It was
&gt; without a
&gt; doubt a weak battery. Given that the temps around here have been hovering
&gt; around the 0 celsius mark for the last few days (which is not that cold
&gt; really) and that I have not driven the Vanagon in about a week (I walk to
&gt; work) it is likely that the battery is either showing its age (3 year old
&gt; Interstate) which was exaggerated by the coldness or there is a slow
&gt; drain on the battery. Three questions - a) any experience with Interstate in
&gt; cold weather? b) is there a definite choice of battery/amps for cold weather?
&gt; and  c) would a head temp gauge and oil pressure gauge that are live (not
&gt; hooked up through the ignition) be a slow current drain?-- 

a)  Nope.  Just had one Interstate battery, and it was garbage.  I have
heard other people rave about them though.

b)  Not really.  I have always had good luck with DieHard/Sears batteries
(except DieHard Gold).  The more CCA's the better, though.

c)  The head temp gauge takes no current at all.  It is somehow driven by
the sensing element.  The oil pressure gauge shouldn't be a significant
drain.

&gt; I am thinking of hooking up a permanent battery charger that would be
&gt; plugged in via the 120 v system or alternately hooking up a solar battery
&gt; charger to keep the amps up.......any ideas appreciated - DC

You shouldn't need to resort to that.  I would make sure your battery is
up to snuff as a first step, then start checking out the charging system.
