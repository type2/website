Subject: Re: damage from missing upper bellhousing bolts?

&gt;What affect would driving around with missing upper bellhousing bolts produce?
&gt;
&gt;I bought a 1970 bus and later discovered that the previous owner(s) did not
&gt;install the engine with the upper bellhousing bolts in place.  They were
&gt;probably too lazy to put them in, and figured the cross-member will hold
&gt;the engine in place &quot;good enough.&quot;

As a further clarification, the lower bellhousing nuts were installed, so
the front of the engine was fastened to the transaxle.  The rear of the
engine was supported by the cross-member.

P.S.  The case did not crack.  Other things happened, and I am wondering
whether the ultimate cause of my Bus' chronic mechanical problems
originates from not having the upper bellhousing bolts installed.
