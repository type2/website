&gt; My 71 has a aftermarket hitch, but I don't think its rated for what you wany 
&gt; to pull.  Mine says gross weight 1100 lbs and 110 lbs tounge weight.  It is 
&gt; mounted to the frame on each side, with a big peice of angle between.  The 
&gt; tounge bolts to the botton of the stock bumper.

Mine appears to be stock or approved accessory (has VW stamped in
the tounge). Same rating as above, but the tounge is welded to
the rear brace in the engine compartment.
