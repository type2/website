&gt;I mostly stay in the middle lane on a three-lane freeway unless I'm

&gt;I've never really cared if someone passes me on the right on a
&gt;three-lane freeway.  I assume that they are exiting or in their judgment 
&gt;the left lane was a bad choice.   As long as they don't tailgate before 
&gt;they pass I have no qualms whatsoever.  Tailgating, however, makes my 
&gt;blood boil.
&gt;
&gt;Calm down, Ger......

Here in Kansas City, I've notice that we have perhaps more left exits on
interstates than any other city I have been in.  It gets unnerving when
you've been tooling along with the rush hour traffic in the right lane at
near traffic flow speed and then you realize you have to cross 2 or 3 lanes
in Indy traffic to get to your exit.  Likewise, if you anticipate way way in
advance the exit and are tooling along at a reasonable speed, everyone gets
upset that you are in the passing lane and not passing anybody.

My best experience has been in rural Texas where the shoulders are wide and
paved and nearly everyone will pull onto them at speed to allow you to pass
without you having to cross the centerline.  (Or maybe they were just aiming
at the armidillos. ;)
