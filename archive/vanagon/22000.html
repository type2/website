Bill,
Here is the Part number for your key  #181-837-219.  It is a Thing P/N so 
It may be hard to find, but call the oldest VW Dealer in your area and 
make those guys look for it for you.  They can run a trace and find it 
though.  Loring

&gt; What I would really love is to get working 'original' VW keys for my two

&gt; 
&gt; Any idea where I can get original Thing key blanks?  Its hard but I've 
&gt; been able to get non-VW key blanks ground for one of the Things?
&gt; 
&gt; I understand the door handles for Things are the same as door handles for 
&gt; bay window buses - are the locks and keys the same as well?  Would this 
&gt; help me get 'VW' keys?  The 'original thing key I got for one os the 
&gt; roundish key with a black rubber cover.  The other key I have for the 
&gt; other looks like the key for the '72 bus my family had - asymetrical 
&gt; rounded triangle but an aftermarket copy not an original 'VW' key.
&gt; 
&gt; Anything I can do to get locks to match between the two Things I got?
