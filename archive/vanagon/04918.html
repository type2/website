&gt; I'll stick with an 85 Vanagon or a 911 depending on whether or not I get 
&gt; any roadie work prospects in the next few months.

Ah, get aff yer high horse! So what if the tires would cost a fortune, you
think some p-zeroes and bbs wheels for your &quot;sensible&quot; 911 would be much
cheaper? This is just a fantasy, parking is NOT an issue, besides I bet
the hummer uses some hideously thirsty turbo diesel.

Maybe I should infuriate you more by mentioning that my second pick would be
an Unimog - big expensive wheels and thirsty engine also.

Alistair &quot;still enjoying the fantasy&quot; Bell.
