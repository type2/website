Well the bus is on the road.  The SO and I are moving in the
next few days and the bus is going to come in way handy to
schlep stuff to our new place (which, though not with a garage
has a carport and it's a HOUSE not an apt. so I won't
get harrassed about working on my car in the parking lot).

Tuneups actually are wonderful things.  The first time I
drove the bus, I just took it out a mile or two (I couldn't
wait) and it ran pretty hot.  The dipstick was holdable
but not for long, and the exhaust (some kind of extractor)
had heated up the rear apron so much I burned myself.

So I got out the old Muir and adjusted the valves (some were
pretty tight), set the point gap, and statically set the
timing to about 7.5 BTDC (per some advice on this list
from a while back).  (Timing comments and advice welcome....).

Now it runs great.  In the same time that the dipstick got
quite hot before it's still cool, and even after a 20 minute
through-town run is only warmish.  I also plugged some
holes in the tin using leftover scraps of window rubber and
big rubber washers.

It drives great!  and is a joy, except for popping out 
of 2nd gear :-( and all the rattling because the door
rubber isn't in yet (waiting for me to have time to rust
treat).

I've got the turn signals to work, and the horn (lots of
sanding the innards of the button before it would work),
now only the brake lights remain and I think I'm pretty
street legal.  P.S. 12 volts going through a 6v horn is
pretty impressive!  

The rear lights go on when I short the brake light switch,
but not when I push the pedal down.  I'm going to take it
off tomorrow and clean up the innards (a trend, these days)
and see if it works.
