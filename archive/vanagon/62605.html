&gt;            My idea was to buy that foam carpet padding stuff (looks like
&gt;            chopped bits of foam glued together) hopefully in about a 1 inch
&gt;            thickness.
&gt; 
&gt;      I think I'd take a hint from what the stuff is intended for.  It's
&gt;      (probably) intended to make carpet bouncy (cushion the head blow in
&gt;      case of a roll-over?) and to insulate it somewhat from heat transfer
&gt;      through the floor (some usefullness here).
&gt; 
&gt;      Course, how ya' gonna keep it up?  Glue will hold it initially, but
&gt;      I'll wager that a few hot days will have it drooping.  Course if
&gt;      you're doing a panel headliner rather than a fabric one, this is of
&gt;      little consequence.
&gt; 
&gt;      Since your interior already burned once, I'm surprised that you'd
&gt;      consider installing something potetentially volatile (which probably
&gt;      will give of severely noxious fumes when burning) as insulation.  But
&gt;      then, perhaps lightning doesn't strike twice. . . .
&gt; 
&gt;      At last look, the boys at Westfalia were still using fiberglas
&gt;      batting.  Good enough for me.

I don't think that is the primary reason.  I live in a town where they
manufacture the stuff.  I will check, but I think the primary purpose is
noise and insulation.  It is used on the floors as well.
