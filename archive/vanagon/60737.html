Subject: Maple Grove VW Show June 8 - Stop By!!
Date: Sat, 31 May 1997 14:59:42 -0400


I hope all you East-Coasters are planning on going to the big VW Show at
Maple Grove Raceway near Reading, Pa. next Sunday June 8th!

Since my vendor space couldn't be the meeting place for list members at the
Manassas show last week as had been suggested by a few people (because I
didn't go), I'd like to volunteer to be the list member meeting point for
the Maple Grove show.  I will be in the swap meet section, hopefully very
close to the entrance (since I plan on getting in line at the crack of dawn
for a good spot).  There will be a yellow Bus Depot banner over the van so
it should be easy to spot.  I'd love to have an opportunity to meet many of
you at the show.  

Also, if anyone will be rolling in the day before (Sat.) and would like to
visit, my wife and I live about 30 miles northeast of Maple Grove and would
love to have you visit.  (We live in a rural area, so there's plenty of
driveway/hookup space for your Westy if you need a place to stay overnight,
too.)  Email me if you'd like directions.

Also, if anyone needs parts and would like to pick them up at the show, let
me know, the sooner the better, and I'll bring them along.

See you then!!
