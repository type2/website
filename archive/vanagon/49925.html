Subject: Ignition key sticks 

I have tried:

        1.  holding other keys on the key ring up to avoid unnecessary
pressure sideways, down, anyways 

        2.  making sure the wheels are straight

        3.  putting some fine graphite powder in the cylinder

        4.  removing the protective cover from the steering column and
jiggling wires to ignition cylinder

        5.  Parking on a relatively flat area vs. incline

        6.  Using original key or copy of key

All to no avail.  The key will not turn at all.  Sometimes I am able to get
it to turn after struggling for a few minutes.  Sometimes, I don't have
enough time to fool with it.  

If I do get it to work, it might work again immediately, or I might have to
fool with it a bit every time I try to turn it.

Do locksmiths deal with auto ignition problems?  Any and all other
suggestions would be very much appreciated.


Thanks,



Rob
