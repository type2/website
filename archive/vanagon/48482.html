Subject: Fridge Fan (inside)

Hi Everyone.  Well, after reading a few posts about how much more 
efficient fridges are with a little fan inside to ciruculate the cold 
air, I decided to get one.

I bought a Frigde-Mate for a whopping $32 CDN.  It was the only one 
in town, and the dealer said I could bring it back if it didn't work. 
This thing runs on 2 D cell batteries that can last 30 days.  It's 
about 2&quot; square, and is about 3&quot; high.  It goes on the bottom of the 
fridge.  I am sure somebody could make one for less than $5 worth of 
parts and some time.

Well, to my amazement, it works like a charm!  My wife and I are very 
pleased with the results.  In the last 2 weekends it has been in the 
mid 30's (around 90 F), and the fridge has been COLD!!  There is much 
truth to the fact that the cooling fins are cold but it can't get 
that cold throughout the fridge.... until now.  I believe it is worth 
the investment.  

Harry.
