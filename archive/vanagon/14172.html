&gt; Anyway! - when we once discussed this on here before, there was 
&gt; general concern (beyond the ones of asphyxiating, and CO poisoning)
&gt; about these pots exploding.  While taking a break from working
&gt; on my new-improved-shower system, I suddenly had a thought:  why
&gt; not use an inverted cast iron pot, perhaps enameled?  Wouldn't this
&gt; be better at trapping and holding the heat, and solve at least
&gt; the explosion/safety issue?  If so, should it have a hold drilled
&gt; in it like there is at the bottom of a terra cotta clay pot?

Pots?  Exploding?  Rubbish!  Dontcha know that those pots are baked in
a kiln, at temps much hotter than that little propane powered flame can
produce?

p.s. Be careful when you are taking that shower - if you put water under
too much pressure it may explode!!!!!!!!  :P
