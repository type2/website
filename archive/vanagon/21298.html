ALLRIIIGHT!!!!!  another TITAN RED van.  i thought i was the only one 
emblazoning the landscape.  actually, i have seen one other one, and 
around here no less.  the guy driving it just gave me this dumb look 
as i was frenetically waving as our two, identical TITAN RED Westys passed each 
other.  Sheesh.
