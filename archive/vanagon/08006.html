&gt;Ahhh, when you stopped in Newton for coffee Mike,
&gt;depending on which exit you got off of, drove right
&gt;by the now snow covered Bus of mine.  I do
&gt;distinctly remember thinking today
&gt;&quot;Damn, I really need a gas heater when I fix my bus&quot;

What's the matter w/yer Bus?  Where is it parked,
anyway?  In sight of the freeway?
 
&gt;I made the rather long and exteremely cold trip
&gt;to Iowa City several times last year, each time
&gt;arriving with numb feet.  And to think, my heater
&gt;boxes are in good shape.....

Yeah, I've done it in the Camper, whose heater boxes
are great, and never even approached the warmth of
the gas heater.  In fact, the gas heater was one
reason I bought the 79...

&gt;Maybe we should rank how hardcore bus owners are by
&gt;the average temperature?  Canada&gt;Minnesota&gt;Iowa ;)

Hardcore, or degrees of insanity?  I dunno...  this could
start a stampede to Wasserboxers, at least by Da Spouse,
who is even more fond of heat than I.
