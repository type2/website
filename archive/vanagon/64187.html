Subject:      Mold

I apologize if this duplicate message but I think I screwed up sinced I
didn't see my message posted.


We've just acquired an 1984 Westy (A.K.A. Dennis).  Dennis has mold spots
on the fuzzy part of his ceiling.  Is there anything I can do to get rid
of the mold but keep the fuzzy-ceiling stuff?

Thanks.

Katy &amp; Ron
