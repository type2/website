This stuff should get into the archives.

Interesting that we could purchase the rear breaks from the VW LT and
install them into our Vanagons. Also, that Tom clarifies that the Vanagon is
the Type II T3 series. He didn't mean to call the Vanagon a Type III; it is
still correctly called a Type II.

&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;
&gt;just recieved CCs of your letter in the mailing list. To avoid further 
&gt;confusion, let me retranslate a few things, I'm afraid my English is too poor 
&gt;to make myself understood as far as the translation of the body-versions and 
&gt;some technical details is concerned.
&gt;
&gt;&quot; Type II &quot; is used  by Volkswagen as a general name for all the Transporters, 
&gt;&quot; Type I &quot; was the beetle, T1 (1950), T2 (1967) T3 (1979) and  T4 (1990) were 
&gt;used for the revisions, but the may overlap, eg. the Type II T3 series lasted 
&gt;from 1979 until 1992 in european 
&gt;production and lives on in South Africa and South America. (according to: 
&gt;Randolf Unruh &quot;VW Transporter &amp;  Bus&quot; Motorbuch Verlag, Stuttgart)
&gt;
&gt;Malcom H. is right in some way, the numbers of seats mentioned were only 
&gt;examples, of course. To be precise: For the &quot;single-cab&quot; and &quot;panels&quot; 2 seats 
&gt;were basic (for the german version). Driver's seat was always single, a 
&gt;double-seat passengers bench could be ordered 
&gt;as an option. &quot;Crew-Cab&quot; was normally five-seated, options were six seats or 
&gt;without any back-seat and 2 or 3 seats in the front row. The &quot;Kombi&quot; was 
&gt;available in a 2-0-0, 2-2-0, 2-0-3, 2-3-0, 2-2-3, 2-3-3, or 3-0-0, 3-2-0, 
&gt;3-0-3, 3-3-0, 3-2-3, 3-3-3, (= front-middle-rear) 
&gt;configuration. &quot;Caravelle&quot; were always at least 7 seaters and available as C 
&gt;(basic), or optional CL, GL, versions, but this changed almost every year and 
&gt;is too complicated to be reported here. 
&gt;
&gt;T3 syncro total:		43 468
&gt;
&gt;including: 	LHD: 	 41 360
&gt;	RHD:	 2 108
&gt;
&gt;engines:  	2.1l i (95 HP)	 14 233
&gt;	2.1l i (112 HP)	 6 259
&gt;	1.9l (78 HP)	 6 641
&gt;	1.6TD (70 HP) 	 16 335
&gt;Transporter	
&gt;- &quot;Pritschenwagen&quot;	Pick-Up Single Cab (245)	 1 787
&gt;- &quot;Doppelkabine&quot;	Pick-Up Double Cab (247)	 6 849
&gt;- &quot;Kastenwagen&quot;	Van, panels (251)	 5 848
&gt;- &quot;Kombi&quot;	Bus  (253)	 14 650
&gt;
&gt;Caravelle	Bus (255)	 14 334
&gt;
&gt;	16&quot; package: 	 2 138
&gt;
&gt;The numbers in brackets refer to the version code on the lable in your VW 
&gt;service documents or sticking somewhere near the fuses-box. With the help of 
&gt;this you can look up if the Westfalia Campers, Vanagons etc. are included in 
&gt;the &quot;Caravelle&quot; or the &quot;Transporter&quot; 
&gt;figueres. This doesn't include the seven or eight T2 4x4 prototypes built by 
&gt;Henning Duckstein in the 1970's. For more detailed information you should 
&gt;write or fax to SDP, press-office, Frau Moerth or Herr Teschl, (but be patient 
&gt;- they don't make $$ any more with the syncro in Graz).
&gt;
&gt;It's true the 16''-package includes enlarged rear brakes from the LT 
&gt;Transporter (a 2,6t - 4,5t light truck probably never dlivered to 
&gt;North-America) but these were conventional ones also, no disk-brakes.

I sort of remembered that Oettinger offered rear disk brakes for Vanagon.

&gt;Front suspension: As far as I know the first series of syncros (until ~ 1989 ) 
&gt;were equipped with a front wheel-suspension made of welded sheet-metal, later 
&gt;they changed it to steel-cast parts which were more rigid and more resistent 
&gt;against corrosion.

Ok, I get it. Now that I look at my van, I see that I already have the later
style.

&gt;Hope my letter is now a little bit easier to understand !
&gt;
&gt;best regards
&gt;
&gt;Tom

&gt;Had some time to install my new MODEM today
&gt;
&gt;Hope that everything works and we hear from you soon
&gt;
&gt;regard
