So far as I know, the work done on the heads was proper. I have no 
evidence of a problem.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;     My 1985 Westphalia camper has been in the shop at ANTONION

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Have you had the repair done by the Antonio Volkswagon? How does it come out?
&gt; &gt;&gt;Did they do a good job on the head/gasket repair? I am considering a VW
&gt; &gt;&gt;dealer in the bay area for the same repair on the head/gasket too. I am 
&gt; &gt;&gt;wondering if The dealer you went to did a good job or not. Did you get the
&gt; &gt;&gt;VWoA to pay the bill for you (base on the FTC settlement VWoA agreed upon)?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I don't remember seeing any follow on posts from you. Please let us know
&gt; &gt;&gt;what happened. Thanks.

&gt; Well, Apparentlt James Cook is the owner of this 85 Westy who sent the camper
&gt; for head/gasket repair. This mail should go to Mr. Cook. Sorry Tim.
