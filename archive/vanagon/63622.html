Matt,

Here's something to maybe look out for more than what specifically to
buy:

I bought a 1979 Westphalia about two years ago.  It's a good car but
there have been a few expensive repairs.  I would just say that if
you're going to go for one of the older ones--and unless you
specifically want to love an older one, don't do it--make sure to take
it to Volkswagen and get a full diagnostic checkout.  They're built to
last but old cars are old through and through and there are just a lot
of things that just need to go bad after a certain number of years no
matter how good they're built, no way around it, from transmissions to
wheel bearings and little rubber thingies and seat covers.

So if you're looking for a functional travel machine off the bat, I'd
really suggest getting as new a van as you can.  An old van well taken
care of is certainly better than a beat up newer van, but all things
being equal, go with the newer model.

Good luck and welcome!
Erik

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a new subscriber to the list (and to the type2 list).  I've gotten
&gt; it
&gt; into my head that it would be fun thing for me and my wife and three
&gt; young
&gt; kids if I bought a VW camper... but I have no idea what I want/need.
&gt; I have
&gt; looked at the vanagon_dot_com website and some of the other VW web
&gt; resources,
&gt; but I'm still not sure...
&gt; 
&gt; For anyone with a little time and patience, maybe you could give me
&gt; some
&gt; guidance, on or off list.  I'm interested in spending $5-$10,000 for a
&gt; VW
&gt; camper with stove, fridge, sink, and other camping equipment (as much
&gt; as
&gt; possible), and I would like to buy something with character and
&gt; personality... We owned three VW's when I was a kid (2 bugs and a
&gt; thing),
&gt; and I have very fond memories...
&gt; 
&gt; Am I looking for a type2?  What year models are type2's?  Am I looking
&gt; for a
&gt; Vanagon?  Either generally?
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice, including references to basic VW resources, would be much
&gt; appreciated.  TIA.
