Subject: Are engines getting scarce?
Date: Wed, 10 Apr 1996 11:33:05 GMT

We had an almost new engine freeze its bearings while on an Easter
trip to visit relatives in Utah. On monday I called around to find a
replacement engine. Nobody in Salt Lake City had one. Seems that they
always import them from California, and it takes a week to get one.
I'm talking 1600 dual port.  A couple of places would rebuild the one
we had. Since the engine that failed is still under warranty
(purchased in San Diego last week), we rented a car one way to San
Diego for $90, put the engine in the trunk, and headed home. We left
our '71 bus at the relatives house in the driveway. 

I plan to fly back in a couple of weeks to install the engine and
drive it home.  Any good ideas on how to ship the engine up there?
I'm sure that it is too heavy to be common luggage or carry-on.
