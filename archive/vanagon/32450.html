Subject: Mr. Holland's Opus with lot's of VW busses
Date: Thu, 11 Jan 1996 14:23:45 GMT


We saw a movie last night that is a must see for musicians
and bus owners. It's called Mr. Holland's Opus, and it
starts in the late 60s. There are bugs and busses all
over the place, and a very nice Corvair. Of special
note is a pre 68 white/red bus with the windows in 
the top that belongs to one of Mr. Holland's
neighbors.
