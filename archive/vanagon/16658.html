  I have the issue with the article on Type 4 head rebuilding. If you &lt;or
  anyone else&gt; would like a copy of this, send me your snail mail or fax #
  and I'll send it. It's only a few pages long and of questionable quality -
  should be labelled &quot;special advertising section&quot; since it touts the 
  rebuilding techniques used by one specific shop. 

  Rocky Mountain Motor Works has rebuilt heads from GEX for about $150 each.
  Several listmembers have commented favorably on the quality of GEX items
  recently. BTW, the rebuilder mentioned in the article sells heads for $169
  each.

&gt; But to get to the point-  any recommendations on good rebuilders
&gt; or sources for new?  I heard that an article relevant to this
&gt; topic appeared in the April issue of one of our fave mags-
&gt; anybody read it and care to summarize?  it's already been
&gt; replaced by the may issue.


  thanks------bill
