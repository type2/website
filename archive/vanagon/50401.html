Subject: Speakers

Hey Guys,

I've been reading about the tricks involed in replacing the speakers in
the front doors.  I know I'm gonna have to do this pretty soon, I still
have the original ones in there and they sound like crap.

Does anyone have a good replacement speaker in mind?  I really want to
use the same holes and grills.
