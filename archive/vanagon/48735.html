        That would put you as going through Weed CA.  That would be a
convenient place for me to link up.

&gt;I'm going to run down to Cabo next July.  I'll probably spend
&gt;fifteen days on the run, border to border, mebbe more.  Gas, food
&gt;and what-not, I'll probably spend twenty, thirty bucks a day, mebbe
&gt;less. 

        I also prefer to travel cheap.

&gt;The side trips will be determined by how many newbies are in
&gt;the convoy, people who have never seen the painted caves or the
&gt;alabaster mines.  But mostly it will be a prolonged beach and
&gt;fishing party, with much of the time spent near the Cape where July
&gt;temperatures are about the same as on the beaches of southern
&gt;California.

        I haven't been to Mexico sense the late '70's when my father and I
went camping and did some mission work(read: construction).  As I recall, we
went in the 181 (Thing) pulling a small tent trailer (not many tent trailers
that weigh in at under 1,000lb).
        I'm starting to rambel, the point of the last paragraph is that you
would have to count me as a newbie.

&gt;Anybody want to come?

        I can't comitt myself for July untill at least May.  But I will keep
this in mind...weighing heavly.
