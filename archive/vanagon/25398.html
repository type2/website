&gt; &gt; As seen in today's Minneapolis Star Tribune and Saint Paul Pioneer Press:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; '80 Vanagon camper, 110k miles, runs well, newbrakes, clutch, and starter.
&gt; &gt;  $2200/bo  612-719-6828
&gt; 
&gt; Oh sure... $2200 in the rust belt.  And I can't sell one for $700 here in 
&gt; CA.
&gt; 
&gt; Thom suggested that I try selling my '80 camper for $1500 OBO.  That way 
&gt; people don't get scared at the low price.  :)  Any takers?

You know people, its actually a nice buggy.  I'd buy it, if I weren't such
a split-window freak.
