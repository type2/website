&gt;
&gt;here goes, it's auto-psycho-sociological: opinons please!?
&gt;
&gt;       I have a reasonably good relationship with the dealership service
&gt;department where I purchased my Vanagon new, six years ago.  I know, that's
&gt;mostly because I mostly, quietly allow them to fleece me about once every
&gt;six months.
&gt;
&gt;        Lately, every time I have some little thing done, they leave some
&gt;part of the job undone!  This last trip was worse! I had the front brakes
&gt;done and drove the 100+ miles home only to discover that my chrome lugs had
&gt;been switched for black ones! chrome on the back, dingy black on the front.
&gt;There were no other Vanagons in the shop that day so I thinking the swap
&gt;was intentional, and I'm really steamed.  Never the less I call the service
&gt;manager whom I think of as a friend, and suggest that a mistake has been
&gt;made.  He gets a little huffy and sez it could not happen, no other vans in
&gt;the shop that day and Vanagon lugs are unique to Vanagons, must have been
&gt;that way when I brought it in. I know that's not the case.  I washed the
&gt;van two days before: chrome all around.  Now I'm not only angry I'm
&gt;worried!  What if these are not the correct lugs and they were just forced
&gt;in?  I might be in danger of them breaking or coming out because they are
&gt;stripped.  Will I have to buy new hubs?  in the face of the service
&gt;manager's denial do I force the issue over eight lug bolts or just order
&gt;new ones for one of the suppliers on the list and then find a new
&gt;mechanic??
&gt;
&gt;thanks for any advise any of you can offer.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
if these are the chrome lugs for factory alloys, wait till you see what the
dealer's price is to replace them. something like 11 or 12 bucks each.
