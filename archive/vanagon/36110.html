&gt; So DHaynes57_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The term permanent refers to all year.  Not having to change for the seasons.
&gt; &gt; Dennis.
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm.... In my dictionary 'permanent' means to last 'indefinately' without
&gt; change.  Does VW use a different dictionary or is this 'newspeak'?
&gt; 

I believe Dennis is correct.  The term 'permanent' is a throwback to 
the days of methanol based anti-freezes that would not be acceptable 
in summer temperatures.  Hence the ethylene glycol based ones that 
could stay in all year round are 'permanent'.  I will admit it is a 
mystery why VW would revert to archaic terminology.  I suspect it has 
to do with copy writers not being car geeks but merely working from a 
list of directives to produce section X of the owners manual.  
Additionally, we must remember that the manuals are written for world-
wide distribution (even tho it says USA models on the cover- they 
dont' re-write the whole thing) and the term might have more 
relevance in other countries.  Lastly, there may be a lawyer lurking 
in the background of all this...  using ambiguous terminology to 
mislead owners into thinking coolant changes aren't necessary and 
hence when gasket failure occurs, they have an out.  Terrible way of 
thinking but why did an archaic term appear in a recent owners manual 
that wasn't there before?

Remember:  NOBODY feels anti-freeze is a 'permanent' solution good 
for the life of the vehicle.
