We're approaching the same point but through mileage not age (bought it=20
as new in late '94), so we too are interested in this.

I'm getting real unhappy with the sound of the engine as it starts in =
the=20
morning.  The local dealer swears that it isn't that 'piston slapping=20
thing'.  They claim that it is only if the sound is always present=20
contradicting the information posted here earlier.  Is the piston slp=20
problem a drive train thing that would give me extra time or is it only=20
under the 24/24 bumper to bumper?  What do I do to convince the dealer=20
to reasses the engine?

The &quot;piston slap thing&quot; IS covered by the drive train warranty, but the =
problem is not catastrophic failure, but rather reduced engine =
longevity. The problem most certainly is audible only when the vehicle =
is started, and then only for about 20-30 seconds. Don't take my word =
for it, check around. Both my local mechanic and the VW dealer told me =
this was so. My dealer in Ballard, WA gave me no heartburn whatsoever =
about the diagnosis and replacement. I would pursue this matter further =
if I were you.

 We have (unfortunately) an automatic so does the shifter problem =

only to sticks? =20

What shifter problem? This is a new one on me.

I really do feel this is an exceptionally well designed vehicle (despite =

the '90s levels of plastic). =20

I agree. This vehicle is great!
