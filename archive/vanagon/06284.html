Subject: hard-pressed brake lites (was Bobo Iceskater)


&gt;  It was
&gt; only after that trip that I found out that my brake lights only worked when I
&gt; press down hard so all my attempts to signal people behind me by touching 
&gt; the brake had gone unnoticed.
&gt; 

Hey, my brake lights do this too!  Ever fix 'em?
What did you do if you did?
