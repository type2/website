Subject: Vanagoning Solution

Hey Folks--

Just an idea.

After reading MPG/drafting information on the list for the last few days
(including Hi Speed Vanagoning ideas) and reading of other challanges I've
come up with a universal solution. Because some of this Vanagoning is a bit
of a challange-- And there are some Vanagon obsticals that are keeping some
of us temporarily immobile. I'll pass on my idea. My problem is the fact that
my manual trans really isn't transing anymore (a pricey problem). But here's
my idea:

I'm gonna tie a canoe to the top of my Westy, disconnect the 02 sensor,
re-torque the heads, turn the Dometic fridge to 12 volt DC, clean the
alternator's commutator with emery, replace the fuel line and fuel line vent
hoses, and find a 20-foot length of strong rope with a grappling hook and
wait for a passing 18-wheeler. If I can set the hook, I'm set to go. It seems
a relatively simple solution to some rather expensive problems. It might be
fun to see where the truck is heading. Maybe it will be somewhere near the
Litchfield, CT Show on June 22, I believe. If all goes well I'll see some of
you there.

On a serious note, thanks to all the list members who have offered advice and
even sympathy with my new purchase's trans woes. I'm determined to get her up
an running in the next week or so--God willing. Also thanks to those who
enlightened me about those breadloaf busses with water-cooled engines south
of the border. I'm gonna need to get a couple of those!
