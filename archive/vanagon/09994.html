Subject: Brazilian Buses

my roommate just came back from his home in brazil and he brought me pictures
of his friends bus.
it is a 1991 bus: this model has late 70's front and rear turn signals, the
rear hatches are from the pre 67 models, as are the 4 square side windows and
corner rear windows, there is a crash cage attached to the front bumper-the
kind you see on havy 4wd vehicles in the states-it extends up to the front
turn signals and out to the headlights, it has rounded bumpers i believe are
early 70's (without the step under the front doors).
i have hopes to fly down and drive a new one back soon, but my friend did not
know particulars such as cost of the new buses etc.

does anyone have experience or know of anyone who has aquired one of these
buses directly from brazil, if so please share the info.

thanks
avery
