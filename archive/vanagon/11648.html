Subject:       AT&amp;T 800 #'s web site

For those of you with a web browser, AT&amp;T has a neat web site that 
will do searches for toll free numbers

http://att_dot_net/dir800

for example, a search for 'volkswagen' brings up many VW dealerships 
and parts places.  a search for 'automobile AND parts' brings up 
several hundred #'s for everything from bumpers to salvage to parts 
warehouses.
