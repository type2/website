Subject: rough pick-up from cold 84



My 84 Westy runs on 3 cylinders first thing in the morning and continues 
to run rough until warm.  In fact now it still misses sometimes even when 
warm.  I have changed the distributer cap and rotor, and changed all
plugs to platinum autolights which are gapped according to autolights
spec and not VW (much bigger gap) but to no avail.  Any ideas?

Thanks
David
