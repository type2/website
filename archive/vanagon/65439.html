Dan -

You didn't state specifically the year, but I'm guessing
by your sig that it's the '80 Westy.  Some previous
responses assumed that you were referring to the '87,
and it has a completely different set-up, of which I
know absolutely nothing.

&gt; 80 westy
&gt; 87 syncro FOR SALE!

The following applies to my '80 Westi:
BTW the California version, the Federal version had no
Idle Stabilizer (IS).

Check grounding and electrical connections.  Hit them
with electrical contact cleaner and reconnect.  The IS
isn't grounded, but other bits and pieces of the system
are, check 'em.

Use the Bentley manual for trouble shooting components.
Basically to see if the IS is working, use a timing light.
If the timing mark jumps around with it connected, it's working.
If the timing mark is steady when connected, the IS is dead.

Be absolutely sure that the connectors to the IS are connected
properly.  There is a little male part that's supposed to fit
into a female part to align the three pins in the IS connector.
If the male part is broken off, the connector will appear to
go together, but the electrical connection is not made correctly.

To adjust idle, one disconnects the IS and connects the ends
together.  The idle will jump around a bit, but the timing will
be steady.  This is part of the procedure for adjusting timing.

Once connected, the IS messes with the timing to achieve
a steady idle.

IF indeed you find that the IS is busted, could you send it
to me.  I'd like to do a post mortem on it to see what's
inside that can cost $150, and if there is a cheaper
approach.  (mine was missing, so no old one to dissect)

My idle stabilizer seems to have a hyperactive streak lately. The idle
is
around 2000 rpm, somewhat intermittently.  When I disconnect the thing,
it
idles just fine at 900 rpm.  Any suggestions?
