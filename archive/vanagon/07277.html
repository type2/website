the story i heard about all this was that VW, MB and others in europe
designed their engines to be diesels FIRST. GM, on the other hand, decided
that Oldsmobile (and Chevrolet) could take one of their gasoline diesel
engines and simply put new heads on it. sure. you betcha. worked great,
didn't it. ;)   Ford, on the other hand, did not have such problems with their
diesel engine ... mostly because they had gone to an old established diesel
company (i think it was Catepillar) and simply used one of their already
proven engines.

GM seems to have a history of screwing up on new projects like that.

&gt;  I think it would be both fun and interesting to collect and organize list
&gt;  data on accumulated mileage and repair frequency. I even know of a &quot;data/
&gt;  statistics pimp&quot; who could probably suggest some good ways to organize it...

har har har har.
