Subject: 4 Vanagon tires for sale

4 VW Vanagon tires for sale, Michelin X, 185 R14, PR6, XZX.  Two of
them have about 200 miles on them, two have about 1,500 miles on them.
They came off of a 1987 Vanagon.  These will last about 45,000 miles
on a Vanagon.  Asking $220.  ($290 + balancing &amp; valves new.)

Why am I selling them?  The van was in a wreck and the insurance company
totalled the vehicle.  The tires came out unscathed.

Please contact Jim Allen.  Home, Seattle: 523-2058; Work, Everett: 356-5433.
