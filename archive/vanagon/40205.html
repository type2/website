Subject: VW bus '78 2ltr problem update!

Hi all

The background...
The engine fan on my 2ltr vw bus came off its mounting. Three bolts sheered, the middle one to the crank was loose.

Todays findings...
I've just had a play with the engine and have withdrawn the fan from the housing. From a suggestion of this list I had a go at starting the engine and it sounds like the starter motor is not working. However when I put the van in gear it &quot;jumps&quot; forward... which suggests the starter motor is ok (doesn't it?).

So any suggestions as to what to do next!?

Many thanks
Ian
