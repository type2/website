Yes!  I think that's a great idea.  I propose that we do Friday
nite as a late-ish potluck ( unless everyone thinks they will
be there by dinner time ) - we can all sort of talk and cook
around the fire, etc.  Saturday, perhaps we could takes jcook's
suggestion and go to the nearby restaurant and see those
wild natives  :)

Anyway, I'm working on the potluck principal, and suggest that
we each bring about 1/3 lb. per person we are bringing in our
group, that's 1/3 lb. of fish or seafood.  I'll bring or make
there the stock, veggies, etc.  If this sounds good, let me know
and we can arrange side things, like garlic bread, salads, etc.,
whatever dishes people would like to prepare ahead OR make
there and add to the potluck for the Friday supper.

Now, do we want to do this on other meals, or is this
too complicated?  I don't mind planning it...
