Subject: Re: '87 synchro advice needed


Tim Smith asked:

    Help me.... I've just viewed an '87 synchro that's for sale. Obvious 
    problems are a rusty exhaust system, a non-working rear differential lock, 
    and bad rear wheel bearings. Power mirrors are dead too. No air cond! What 
    else should be checked out? Any synchro specific tests I can do? I have my 

to which H YATES replied

    Anyway, have the brakes checked out.  The
    Syncro has it's own brakes, and the front rotors are around $300 EACH!!
    in Canadian $$.. With the Syncro, your maintenance costs are going to
    skyrocket..

I can attest to that...  I found Rapid Parts in Tallman, New York
(914-357-6611) to be a good place for parts.  We bought Synchro stuff from
them a couple times.  Exhaust bits were about 40-50% discounted from the
dealer's prices.  Front brake rotors were $48.95 each (that's US$, but still
a hell of a lot cheaper than $300 Canadian).  Front strut cartridges were
$107.95 each.  I have no idea what hassles there might be getting bits
shipped across the Canada/US border.

To the best of my knowledge, nobody makes stainless exhaust bits for
Vanagons.  It's probably worth pinging a couple places to see if they would
like to take up the challenge.  Perhaps some sort of &quot;group purchase&quot; could
be put together from the list to make the initial investment of their time
and money worthwhile.  One place I called in the Rochester/Buffalo New York
area (seen in the back of British Car magazine - I will look it up if
anyone's interested) said all they needed was a template.  A regular piece
might do the trick.  (Could you buy the part from a dealer, ship it to the
SS exhaust mfr, then return the part to the dealer? :-)
