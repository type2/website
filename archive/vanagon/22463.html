Subject: RE: Vanagon Power?


Jim,

&gt;Wow, my '84 Vanagon has a hole in the muffler - appears to be the cause of 
&gt;some backfire problems.  Anyway, are there any alternatives to the $800-$900 
                                  You can find one much cheaper than ^^^^^^^^

&gt;exhaust system?  I don't want to invest more in the pipes than the van is 
&gt;worth.  (DREAMER????????)
      This will be your own judgement call. For example, my local Stevens Creek
      VW dealer's repair department constantly have vanagon owners spend $$$ to
      fix their vw's leaking head gaskets. Many times, the $$$ spent is equal to
      or more than the cost of vehicles. People do this because, in the long 
      run, it is cheaper than you buy another vehicle and face another set of
      problems. How about a brand new one? It is also your call.

      These are my two cents. Good luck.

James
