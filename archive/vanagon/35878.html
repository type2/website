Subject:  Gravity Bleeding. 

This makes sense to me. When bleeding, you are relying on the 
fact that after you close the bleeder, and let the pedal up, the
brake line pressure is reduced so the master cylinder won't be able to 
suck the fluid back. However if the line is empty (full of air) when you
release the pedal, the master cylinder sucks on the line. If the line is full 
of air, then the air being compressable (Expandable in this case) will allow
the master cylinder to suck the fliud back and create a slight vacuum in 
the line. The key word being SLIGHT. With a full line, or mainly full
line, the master cylinder would have to pull a major, or complete vacuum on
the line to get the fluid back.
SO! If the lines are empty, and the master cylinder is above them, when you
open all the bleeders, the brake fluid shoud run downhill into the lines, and
eventually out of the bleeders, substantially filling the lines. From there, 
you can bleed without the problem described above.

This si sort of an unpowered version of the power bleeders which 
using a bung to seal the top of the resevoir, and force fliud into the
master cylinder, and hence the lines when you open the bleeders.

I hope this is understandable. 
NOTE: This is an opinion, it is not being presented as hard facts!
