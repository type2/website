Subject: volkswagen vanagon 88

To whomever answers these questions,

We'd be grateful if someone (our VW mechanic can't help) could tell us 
about 88 Vanagon powerlocks. Ours cycle on, lock and immediately 
unlock at the same time. We checked the fuses; unable to indentify 
which relay controls the locks. Anybody know?

Thanks!
