Subject: Re: 97 EV Norcold Fridge Problems

     Actually, it does sound like Norcold/Winnebago is moving to fix your 
     high(?) altitude problem, just not in what you (and certainly I, if in 
     your situation) feel is in a timely fashon.
     
     And, of course, what kind of &quot;flatlander&quot; mentality (given the 
     penchant of camper owners to travel) at VWoA/Winnebago would even 
     consider this an &quot;option&quot;?  Or would consider the arguably more 
     picturesque areas of the US as &quot;high&quot; altitude?  Geesh, let's get a 
     little closer to the tree line before we start invoking the term &quot;high 
     altitude&quot;!
     
     But come to think of it, my Westmoreland-built '86 Golf is a bit of a 
     &quot;kluge&quot; too (but not as much as the Westmoreland-built Rabbits were!).
     
     Another reason why my '91 Westfalia is probably the newest camper I'll 
     ever own.
