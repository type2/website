Sounds similar symptoms to my son's Cabriolet - which turned out to be leaking
fuel injectors. Overnight the excess gas must evaporate, but after shorter
times the leaking gas collects in the intake manifold and causes very rich
running.

This should be easy to check: build up fuel pressure and pull the injectors.

Does this make sense, or is my VW addled brain reaching for straws?  Any
input?
