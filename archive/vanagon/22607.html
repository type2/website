Yechh!

	I did a really, really dumb trick, and I am kicking myself up and down
for it.

	Remember the steering column lock and early ignition switch I got?

	Well, today I was gonna go down to the locksmith and get them keyed
to my key, but I can't find them!  I'm going thru my parts stash, all over
the place, to no avail.

	Then it dawns on me.  SH*T!  They're in the acid bath!  I go
out back and take the lid of, and its bubbling, nicely.  SH*T.  I reach
in (bare hands, 'cause I'm torqued) and pulled them out.  What was left.
The ignition switch was nothting more than a bezel and tumblers.  The 
column lock was just a shell, which collapsed in my hands.

	You see, i put them in last weekend &quot;just for a bit&quot;  to clean
some corrosion off, since they'd been exposed to the elements.  I forgot,
and left them in ALL week!  Now I have nothing.

	I Guess the VW gods can take it away just as fast as they give it
to you.  Must be because I've had impure thoughts of other busses!

	You can find me dangling from the ol' oak tree round back...
