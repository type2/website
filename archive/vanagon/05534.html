&gt; If you want a bunk in a Vanagon flat-top get one of the old

&gt; It's ok, Tim - all is forgiven, just take some politically-correct
&gt; cultural sensativity training classes, ok?   :)
&gt; 
&gt; Now, WHERE can I get this hammock?

Oh oh oh, I can answer this.  Go to a salvage yard and find an older 
Westy conversion, maybe even a split.  This hammock hangs above the 
front seats and is mounted by four little hooks that screw into the 
frame of the van.  You need to take those out.  The hammock itself can
be found stored above the closet in the back on the right hand side of
the bus.  You should only need to drill two small holes for 
each hook and you're cookin'.  These things are great but be advised 
that they will bend a little under the weight of 200lb campers. :(  

Oh, one more thing.  You might want to install the hammock in
the old van and measure everything before you tear it out to 
put it into your vanagon.  Hope this helps.  Jim
