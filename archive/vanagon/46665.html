&gt;just a small question...
&gt;Are you guys going to expand the 'sermons of Bob H.' pages ????
&gt;I am really learning a lot about VW's lately and the books I bought recently
&gt;helped me out just great,so did all the info I found on those pages.
&gt;I hope you will add some more subjects,because that is just what we need !
&gt;Thanks

Hi yourself.

What 'guys' are you referring to?

I write VW-related articles from time to time, usually becuase so many people
ask the same question.  It's easier to write an article and thereafter refer
them to the archive.  I do not have any web pages as such.  The archive, the
so-called 'sermon' file, is maintained by Mr. Richard Kurtz at his own
expense and is free to all.

When my lap-top died recently during a trip to Kansas City there were about
twenty articles in various stages of completion -- and various subjects -- on
the hard-drive.  Since then I've discovered the Toshiba warranty is even
flimsier than Volkswagen's.

I've no idea when you'll see the next article nor what it will be about.  I
really don't have that much spare time and without a portable computer I
doubt I'll get much writing done during the remainder of the summer.  .

-Bob
