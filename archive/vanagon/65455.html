Ian,
Which ever way you go it becomes a &quot;LABOR of LOVE&quot;
You have to labor with it to keep it running, but you will love the Vw
experience because there are some great people envolved with these
vehicles.  This list provides a valuable source of information and
support for Vanagon owners.  Enjoy

&gt; My wife has fallen in love with the idea of owning a Westphalia, having
&gt; been inspired by a friend's '93 Eurovan. (A very deluxe model with all mod
&gt; cons.)  In order not to spend the rest of my life regretting that I bought
&gt; the wrong model just because it was there, I have done some homework, and
&gt; now solicit your opinions.
&gt; The early ones are underpowered.  (On the other hand, I own a '68 Ghia, so
&gt; I don't have to learn the mechanics.)
&gt; The 1984 - 90 wasserboxers are nice to drive, but have cooling, head and
&gt; injector problems, and cost a lot to fix.  The 91 - 92 models have more
&gt; power and fewer problems.  The 93 and later Eurovans, according to someone
&gt; in the business, have lots of mechanical problems.  (My friend just got his
&gt; with very few Kms on it, and it's sure nice to drive.)  So.  Confirmation?
&gt; Arguments?  Recommendations?  Thanks in advance.
