&gt;&gt; I'd say that an ammeter would be my third preference, so that you can keep
&gt;an
&gt;&gt; eye on the charging system.  But..... given that you need to run some
&gt;really
&gt;&gt; big wires quite a ways to accomplish this, I'll be opting for a voltmeter
&gt;in
&gt;&gt; the near future when I add gages to my van...

Actually, an ammeter will only tell you weather the battery is charging or
discharging.  It is poosible for a run down battery to take a charge at only
11 or 12 volts.  A properly wired voltmeter will actually tel you the status
of the entire system.  Overloading the alternator or wiring will result in a
lower voltage.  A slipping belt will even be detectable under a load.
 Ammeters were used long ago when the charging system was current regulated.
 Voltage regulated systemsshould the the voltage monitored.
