Subject: Price Cut on Syncro Westie, and misc.
Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 10:57:01 -0500

Got a note from one of the sellers on the Syncro Westie page,
droppng the asking price for his '90 SW $2K to $17.5 or best offer. 
At least it identifies him as a serious.

I've also updated more links, and added a guestbook
which no one seems to want to sign :-(.

Let me know of any other problems.
