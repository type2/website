I filled my '86 with the middle seat out from floor to roof with various 
papers several times a week for several years. Felt like billions of pounds.

Finally destroyed the transmission at 135,000 miles, I guess the good part 
is that I never had to replace a CV.  The Van is at somewhere around 
210,000 miles now, still haven't replaced a CV, and is still being user 
to haul papers.

Oh yeah, and the heads has never leaked!

&gt; That was not a nice drive.. For me or the van.
