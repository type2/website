caused is that now the camper won't heat up in cold weather.&quot;

  Very interesting Robert.  I've been interested to hear a report from
someone who's dumped substantial engine heat this way.  Your oil cooler's
location makes it especially subject to becoming covered with mud or, if
oily, oil soaked dust.  Have you experienced much of this kind of fowling?
