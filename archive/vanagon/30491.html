Subject: Re: Bus top speed, not about spelling!

&gt;&gt; 	how fast will a breadloaf bus with the 1970cc fuel injected
&gt;
&gt;Personal best on my 1800 at full throttle on level road is 86 mph, 
&gt;wind in my back. Worst: 46mph, wind in my face. Best lateral speed: one 
&gt;lane in a heartbeat, gusty side wind.

Excellent description Sami, must be what VW use to define the performance 
envelope. This is how mine went when healthy.  Tim
