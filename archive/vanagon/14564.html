Subject: Re: Kids Review Red Rock

Bradley P:
&gt;Cool... I got a &quot;cool guy&quot; award.  :)  Sorry I didn't try to corrupt your 
&gt;kids, maybe next time.  And how could I possibly drink to much?


Lessee, how'd it go?  

Here's Bradley talking like a sailor, glances to the side,
  &quot;There's no kids around, right?&quot;
Alice:  &quot;There's one right behind you.&quot;  (Siena)
Bradley:  &quot;Aw, geez, they should make 'em wear bells or something.&quot;

One of the finest memories of the weekend for me.  ;-)
