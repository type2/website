[description of Fukengrueven sticker deleted]

&gt; over the &quot;u&quot;'s.  I'm sorry, flame me, call me tasteless, heck, kick me 
&gt; outa here (no, not that please - I'll behave from now on), but I WANT 
&gt; ONE!  My wife, a staid, reticent woman of pure Norwegian descent, will 
&gt; even let me mount the d*mn thing!  As anyone else seen these?  Where can 
&gt; I get one (preferably by special courier, or maybe I could settle for FedEx)?
&gt; 

I got mine at a Grateful Dead concert.
