Subject: If anyone's interested - FS 88 Wolfsburg GL

It's at a local dealer.  

It's blue with six captians chairs.  It looks factory, but I've never 
seen an interior like it.  The spedo says 25K, turns out it was replaced 
at 82K.  Automatic and it has the alloy wheels.  The body's in pretty 
good shape.  Minor rust at bottom of foot well near front door. One small 
ding on the rear fender flare.  

I did test drive it.  Only stalled 5 times evern after it warmed up.  Oh, 
then the oil buzzer came on, but no overheating.  

Needless to say I talked then down from $7,000 to $2,800 (including tax) 
in about 30 min.

If anyone wants a fixer upper let me know and I'll send you their number.

BTW, it's in Jacksonville, FL.
