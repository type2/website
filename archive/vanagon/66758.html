Subject:      '81 Vanagon, general overhaul question and paint color question.

First. My '81 Vanagon is going to get a new 2L long-block from GEK (sp?) as
the old one lost compression (zero) in two cylinders. Can anyone comment on
this companies engines? Also, since I am replacing the engine, can anyone
suggest what else I could/should do as a matter of general principle? This
volks has 131K miles. As far as I know, everything (except the exhaust and
brakes) is stock and original. Before dying, this van ran great.

Second, in looking for touch-up paint I went directly to a VW dealership. I
thought this was a no brainer, as the van is a two-tone (yellow lower, cream
upper). The dealer told me NO '81 vanagon was painted those colors. In fact,
they told me the only color combination used was two-tone, brown/tan in that
year. I am pretty sure the paint is stock and original. Any comments?

Thanks in advance,
Bob Savaglio
