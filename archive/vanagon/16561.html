Subject: Fan Belt Woes

    Driving thru downtown today, I began to hear a noise like metal scraping
along the pavement, and then pulled over to see what was dragging. Nada. I
opened the engine compartment and lo and behold the fan belt had a big ole
gasher in it. Below that, there was some fresh oil on the compartment base
and was dripping from the oil sensor itself!! What's this??!! Did the engine
just get so hot that it began to seep from the sensor?? The sensor also looks
as though it's not completely screwed in anymore. What's goin' on?? Why
didn't my oil light come on? *perplexed* I can change the belt, but I'm
looking for some input on the oil sensor deal. &quot;preciate it!
