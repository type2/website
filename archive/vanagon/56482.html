Subject: strength of plastic Vgon engine lid

First step in converting my plastic engine lid for use with taller engine
was to cut a hole 20x24 inches in it, at which point it still had a 
surprising amount of strength.  With an unbutchered one, I wouldn't 
worry about anything short of ax-blows or a real heavy point-load like
an engine rocked onto one balance-point during loading.
