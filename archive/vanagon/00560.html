Subject: Bus keys

&gt;What I would like to know is if its possible to go the other way 'round,
&gt;I have '56 Kombi with a not-the-original ignition, and I would like to put 
&gt;an early ignition switch in, and have a key made to match the doors.  Has
&gt;anyone ever done this or heard of it? How much does it cost?

I assume you want to make it so that the ignition switch is actuated
by the door keys? In that case you'd need new tumblers in the ignition
cylinder. I don't know if the VW ignition switch used &quot;standard&quot;
tumblers that a locksmith might have, but if so, it's relatively
simple to re-key it to match a particular key. A friend who is a
locksmith did my entire house that way -- though note that it's a lot
easier when you're dealing with a known entity! (KwikSet locks, which
is what he recommended that we buy when we installed the locks).

Or of course you could redo all the door locks so that they're actuated by
the new ignition key... but, again, I haven't the foggiest notion whether
locksmiths can deal with early German hardware. I assume they can... but
you may need to call a few to find one with the expertise.
