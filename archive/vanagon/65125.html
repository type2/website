Subject:      LOUD Engine

I think I might have a problem. All of the sudden, my '85 Vanagon engine
sounds really loud - much louder than normal. It sounds like it is
coming from the passenger side of the engine. I have looked for obvious
muffler problems but haven't seen anything. Power seems to be about
normal. Any ideas before I take it in?
