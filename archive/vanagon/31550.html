So Joseph F. Fournier II says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Inversely, for cold weather the above should still be true as well
&gt; &gt;as the flaps in the fan housing that allow air to blow on to the
&gt; &gt;engine should be in working order and the thermostat hooked up so
&gt; &gt;that it can close the flaps in cold weather and thus, keep the engine
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't the thermostat OPEN the flaps as the engine temperature rises? 
&gt; Unless I'm still confused about this, I believe the spring holds the 
&gt; cooling vanes (&quot;flaps&quot;) closed and the thermostat pushes them open as the 
&gt; temp rises.
&gt; 
&gt; Would someone with more experience please validate or refute this?
&gt; 

Excuse me???  My Experience isn't good enough??  GRRRRR!!!

I wasn't implying that the flaps close when the temp gets colder.  I 
meant that they adjust to the cold temperature.  Sometimes, that means
they are going to close a little so that the air will 'warm' to optimum
operating temperature.

Ugh!!!
