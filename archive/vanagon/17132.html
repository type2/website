Subject: Click type torque wrench

I have a question about click-type torque wrenches.  I bought all 
these tools at least a couple of months ago.  I figured I would by the
tools first and then the parts, which I am doing.  So anyway, the 
torque wrench sat unused until yesterday.  I friend drove into town 
with a broken, a broken, well it was a french car, I don't want to 
talk about it.  So he pulled out the whole right halfshaft and I 
helped him bolt in the new one.  I was under the impression that when the 
bolt reached its specified torque that the wrench would just skip or 
something.  But you could continue to torque.  So I figured that click
was the signal that I had better stop turning.  I think I answered my 
own question here but somebody please confirm.  I sure am glad I am 
getting to trial run these tools on something else.  A couple of weeks
ago I drilled out a couple of broken bolts on my dad's truck.  Also, 
if you stayed with me this long, I inked a lease on a place last night
with a garage!  It is now just a matter of weeks before I am mobile 
once again with the '71 campmobile.  :)  Jim
