Regarding broken door locks on '71 type II's.  Mine is broken on the 
drivers side.  My solution is to only unlock it from the outside.  If 
it won't open I have to turn the key, several times, to the lock 
position, then unlock.  Basically, turn the key back and forth until 
it opens.  If someone unlocks it from the inside the key will not 
work.  This has been my experience.  I did take the thing apart and 
removed the broken spring.  I can't say whether I gained partial 
operation of the lock as a result.  I didn't try the multiple key 
turning method until after I had removed the spring.  Jim
