Subject:      1988 bus reaches 100,000 miles!!! film at eleven.

well, i'm in the six-digit realm now ... only trouble is, it's my bus's
odometer, not my salary. :(  so i thought i'd entertain you folks with
some retentive statistics and such about the long and winding road to
the first hundred thousand. actually, it was kinda odd ... i didn't plan
it this way, but today is exactly the 7th year, to the day, since i bought
the bus. :)

 102,510   4504.00  ** total ** on 12/02/1995 (7 years).

gasoline used:
                Tanks  Gallons      Cost       Miles   mpg    $pg   mp$
-Total            385  5,064.1   5,754.55  100,142.7  19.78  1.136  17.40
 Per Tank Avg             13.2      14.95      260.1  19.78

so we have
  14,645 miles/year (about average).
    $645 unplanned repair stuff per year (mostly those two big ticket
          items, only one of which was really vw's &quot;fault&quot; (the trans)).
          (if not for the melting of the wiring harness and the
          transmission repair, it would have been only $1934 total, or
          about $20/month for non-maintenance repairs).
          maintenance items are probably excessive ... i change the oil and
          oil filter every 2500 miles.

overall, not tooo bad. :)  i'm pretty pleased with the bus.

oh, yeah. and $8,000.00 (at least) for &quot;accessories&quot;. :) power radio
antenna, space shuttle landing lights, rear anti-collision fog lights,
$200 worth of reflective tape (inside, of course), cb radios, aircraft
compass, syncro &quot;mud guards&quot;, camper rear hangie-straps, window tint,
driving computer, switches, tools, and assorted &quot;maybe i can do
something with this!&quot; stuff. :)

and i have no idea how much on toy buses. :)
