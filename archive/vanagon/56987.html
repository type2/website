Subject: Re: EV on TV!

Recently looked at two NEW Rialtas, both the longer version. Only difference
I could see was the external storage in the rear - which provided a &quot;shelf&quot;
at the botton of the rear window. No real internal space difference that you
could see. 

The second one was with leather interior! This was really nice - and the price
was not that much higher. I believe we were given a &quot;cash price&quot; of around
$54k (seemed too low at the time?). We remarked that we prefered the front
half of one style and the rear of another. The sales guy called and found that
Winnebago will do what you want with the interior - for a price. So you can get
a custom (within reason) interior.

We did feel that there was actually more storage space in our Westy than in
the Rialta. Especially in the kitchen area. They are spacious to look at, but
seem to be short on storage area. We would take one with two front seats, the
rear dinnette, and a credenza or something on the drivers side to open the
window view, but provide storage space. I guess this would be the 3 forward
seat style combined with the rear kitchen/dinnette - and then add a &quot;special&quot;
credenza? Leather would be nice! But I would have to win the lottery first!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;.  Two people can sleep in the back  table/fold down bed. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt;    This layout seats four up front. Two other alternatives seat just two
&gt; up front  with either twin beds or a double bed in the rear.  In this
&gt; floorplan, the galley is behind the driver, and on the opposite side,
&gt; behind the passenger seat  is a pull -up table and swivel chair for
&gt; dining.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;&gt;  I won't even talk about the $73,000 the guy paid for it.  I'd rather
&gt; buy 6 more Syncros...one for each day of the week. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt;    This seems way too high to me.   Last year at a boat/van/camping show,
&gt; 1996's were priced at around $45,000.  As with cars, RV prices are
&gt; negotiable.  Haven't seen the 97 yet, since it's a foot longer I'd expect
&gt; some interior changes, and of course a price increase!
