Subject: RE: small part, BIG BUCKS!

&gt;On my '78 bus there's a fan over the motor, in the engine compartment that
&gt;is used for the heater.  THis is controlled by a little box on it, that
&gt;has 5 or 6 leads, and a little plastic harness plugs onto it with all the
&gt;wires on the harness.  Well, I think it's broken (actually pretty darn
&gt;sure), but the local VW dealer wants over $60 Canadian for the part, and
&gt;no one else in the city has it.  Help, does anyone have a spare one they'd
&gt;sell?

I think I may have the fan at home.  I'll check when I get off work and let
you know.  In the meantime, did you know that this thing only works when one
of the heater control levers on the dash is in a certain position?  I don't
remember which one (it wasn't my bus), but when you move one of the levers
either all the way up or all the way down, it hits a switch that turns on the
fan.
