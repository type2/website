Subject: Advice on Weber progressives, please

List,
As you can see, I've been spending too much time in my parts bin, dreaming 
of things to do my VWs.  I have 2 type 4 progressive kits.  Both carbs are 
Webers, one is a R6653-1; the second is a 32/26 DFAV.  They appear to look 
identical.

Is there any known difference?  What jet sizes should I try for best economy 
on a 2000 type 4 engine?  Any other list wisdom &amp; experience on using 
progressives will be greatly appreciated.

TIA,
Dean

BTW - to combat the cold weather driveablity problems mentioned on the list 
earlier, I plan on using an air cleaner from a car that used a Weber, like a 
Vega, Pinto, Chevette, etc., and piping the warm engine cooling air to it.
