&gt; VW could have made the beetle run clean.  The design of the motor is not
&gt; inherently dirty (look at what Porsche has done).  I think they just
&gt; didn't believe that it was worth the effort to pour so much money into
&gt; an aging model.  They decided it was better to spend the money on designing
&gt; a new model.  Too bad they didn't do both.


	Good point. I had it in my head air-cooled was inherently dirty.
	thanks.

&gt; 
&gt; It's  a POS because it is overpriced and underengineered.  My sister owns
&gt; one and has had nothing but bad things to say about it.  It has been in
&gt; and out of the shop with increasing frequency, even though it has yet to
&gt; break 100k miles.  I've seen them, I've ridden in them, I think they suck.
&gt; Sorry bout that... :)
&gt; 
	Can't argue with that.
