Yo: there must be at least three people on the list from Ottawa. I haven't
been able to say much as of late because of work. Come spring, it looks
like the clutch hydraulic system will have to be overhauled on the
Westy...I look forward to sharing info on Ottawa parts stores. One place I
have had extremely good luck is Motobahn which seem to be giving parts
away (ie O2 sensor at 50 dollars; Bosch plugs at 2.50 etc). Regards - DC
