&gt; I have seen a adaptor that lets you use a 30 pict carb on a dual port 
&gt; manifold, and believe it or not, he too was using a 009.  This engine idled 
&gt; really well. 

if this adaptor is a metal spacer plate, about 3/8&quot; thick, then I have
heard bad things about it. If you actually look at the plate, it is a
sharp bend in the path of the gas down into the cylinders. This is badly
inefficient. On the good side however, I happily run a 009 and 30/31
pict on my single port '67.
