&gt; Why did you choose a 5-50? My local VW shop recommended either 5-30 or
&gt; 10-30 (Mobil 1). My driving conditions are mostly highway. Weather temps
&gt; vary between low 40's up to high 90's depending on the season. My '90 Westy
&gt; has just under 7k miles.
&gt;
&gt; Any recommendations?

10-30 is far too light.  You need -50 something for hot days.
I'm not running synthetic, but I think the numbers equate.
