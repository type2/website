Subject: Front heater motor replacement

&gt;
Does the dash have to be removed?  Does the stearing wheel drop down out =
of
the way?  Any idea of a replacement part?  I don't know if the dropping
resistor is also burned out.
&gt;

The archives have a good description of this project.  I will be doing it=

later this year.
