&gt; DOUBLE CAB '61, complete, not running. $1200 b/ofr Ph. 965-4639 
&gt; (maybe sucha deal!, maybe sucha deal!, if only I had $1200)
&gt; 
Gone, sold that day for $1000.  No engine, no brakes, wrong trans, and
some bad rust according to the seller.  He said he &quot;dumped it&quot; because he
needed the room.
