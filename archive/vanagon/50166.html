Subject: oil pressure light
Date: Mon, 7 Oct 1996 13:04:40 -0400 (EDT)

I have recently had a somewhat disturbing experience with my
oil pressure light. After driving on the highway for about two
hours att constant speed i slowed down and coasted with the
clutch in for a bit before shifting into third to continue
slowing down.  while i was coasting with the clutch in the oil
light and buzzer came on and stayed on until i down shifted
into third and brought the rpm's back up.  This happened two
more times on the trip, but not everytime a situation as above
occured.  
	I am perhaps overly concerned since this was my first
highway trip on my rebuilt engine. I had already put about 300
miles on the engine without incident.  I recall seeing some
posts about this type of occurrence in the past, but can't
recall solutions (and i don't have extensive time to search the
archives) Any ideas/past experiences/recollections of previous
posts would be greatly appreciated.  Is it possible that i just
need a new sensor or ???.
many thanks in advance
