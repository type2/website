Subject: public thanks to dean aukes!


Volks - I just wanted to give Dean Aukes a public pat on the
back for having the memory of an elephant.  He remembered my
post from several months back about needing a vanagon westy
table leg (metal-pole/pipe thing), found 2 with bases in a
yard near him, and sent them to me!  As I'd been looking here
for  long time without success, I was euphoric to get these!
Dean - just let me know whatever parts you my be looking for,
and I'll keep an eye peeled for them.  

This event made me think that it would not be a bad idea for
somone to have some sort of reference page, where we could
all enter our parts/tools wishes.  If someone is going &quot;junking,&quot;
they could keep an eye open for the stuff.  People would have to
be either diligent about updating the list when they got
the desired part, and/or the people going junkyarding should
probably check first with the lister to make sure the part is
still needed.  There could be a lot reciprocal kindness here.

Anyway, thanks a million Dean!  :)
