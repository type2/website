Subject: Rebuild? Please Help!!!!


My 69 bus had the oil light go on yesterday, I was in the middle of a 
crowed city so I pulled off as soon as I could. Checked the engine and 
the hose from the oil cooler to the engine was off, oil was all over the 
engine compartment. I walked to a friends house and called my girlfriend 
she picked me up and we went to the hardware store and got a clamp for 
the hose. We went back to the bus and cut the bad end of the hose off and 
reclamped it. I put in some oil. And I got to work fine. I had put in two 
quarts before and another two quarts at work, but on the way home it 
stalled overheated and I sat around for 5-10 minutes and was underway. It 
did ok but stalled when I slowed down. I had to pop it in gear to save 
the starter and battery. Today it's hard to crank and stalls when I go 
into gear. To oil is a little high although it was fine yesterday, I 
think I'll drain some out. So do I need a rebuild. The engine has about 
8K miles on it and ran fine till yesterday, what kind of damage could I 
have done? Thanks.
