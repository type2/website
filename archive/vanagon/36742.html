&gt;Not even close!

leave us not forget: the &quot;Vanagon&quot; body style is STILL being made in South
Africa ... with an inline 5-cylinder engine, no less. so how much trouble
would it be for them to produce a left-hand-drive version for the u.s.??
with a wabbit engine?? surely not as much trouble as it was for the mexican
plant to completely re-engineer the bread-loaf for a water-cooled engine.

&gt;drives the big thing. Even in Europe. But with VW's base prices about 5K
&gt;more than the others why would anyone buy a VW.  I can buy a caravan for

that would be the only problem i see with the SA Vanagon ... price. those
things are pretty high-priced down there already.

&gt;.  VW's American organization is too
&gt;&gt;dumb to know how to sell it maybe...
&gt;
&gt;On this we both can agree.

yup. even too dumb to know WHO to sell it to.
