Welcome to &quot;The List&quot; and to the wonderful world of Type IIs.  I'm also in
the Twin Cities area (Burnsville), just got to the area in Jan 94.  My 1972
(SLOWLY getting together) Westfalia didn't get up here until Oct 94.  It
still is not on the road or moving under its own power unless you count
moving around the garage using the starter :-).  There is a VW club in town,
The Twin Cities Volkswagen Club, that meets the first Wednesday of every
month at Westside VW in St. Louis Park.  We are open for new members!  If you
come to one look for me.  E-mail to get together or something.
