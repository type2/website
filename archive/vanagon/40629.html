&gt; '93 EuroVan GT, 5-speed, loaded, ABS, low miles, VA inspection, hard to
&gt; find.  Pallone Chevy Geo.  703-451-0558.

These guys might be considered less than straight.  I have to watch how I 
phrase it in public.  Must be a &quot;GL&quot;.  I got my Chevy S10 from these 
guys.  I never ever intend to set foot on their property again.  We have 
developed our own &quot;salute&quot; that we do everytime we pass by the 
dealership.  Shame they have a good EV captive....
