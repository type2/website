Frank: do you recommend drilling strategically placed holes and spraying
in some Rust Check or equivalent or is an anti-rust paint preferable? TIA

&gt; Steve... and anyone else into this topic.   The oil is going to seep out
&gt; the seam between the two panels.  The chanel is about 1/2&quot; deep ??, I
&gt; didn't measure it when I was in there (:-).   A good rust inhibitor would
&gt; probably work as well,  it needs to be a substance that will &quot;travel&quot; by
&gt; capillairy action unless you want to take all your cabinets out and get
&gt; full access to the the seam, then you could rustproof it properly.  The
&gt; problem stems from Volkswagen and probably  all other car companies
&gt; welding together panels then not treating the bare metal joint from BOTH
&gt; sides.  They figure that some seam sealer and paint from the outside to look
&gt; &quot;pretty&quot; in the showroom is fine !   WRONG !
