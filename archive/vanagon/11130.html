Subject: Most excellent response to California import question!

Many Thanks to everyone who answered my question on getting a vehicle into
California.  This question is difficult to get  answered  from a distance.
If the move materializes I will probably attempt to reinstall the non
functional EGR and air pump so that they are  aesthetically pleasing but
still non functional.

Several years ago I attemted to find the ONE TRUE ANSWER on importing a
vehicle from the U.S. to Canada. As with this situation, it was difficult
to get a straight response from the various governmental agencies involved.
