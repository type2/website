Subject: PHOBIAS~A friday thing

The wife was checking on some misc home medical remedy in the Doctor's Book
of Home Remedies when she laughed and mentioned that there was a phobia
relating to the &quot;fear of rust.&quot; It's called Iophobia. A quick search in the
webcrawler revealed little on phobias, Iophobia, or rust.  There is a site
called RustNet(tm) a commercial server out of Michigan. If interested it's
at http://www.rustnet_dot_com. Not worth tripping over to get at but OK.

I privately wondered if the fear of &quot;Rusty&quot; would be closer to eieiophobia.

I smell a thread brewing... ;)
