Subject: Brown interior / sunroof survey

I'm looking for a late-model bus (77-79) with a brown interior AND a
sunroof.  (Yes, sunroof, not camper.)  My friends feel I'm very
optimistic.  Since no-one seems to have manifestos for VW shipments to
the States, I can't find out exactly how many of these arrived to our
shores.  So I thought I'd ask the question:

If you have EITHER the brown interior OR the sunroof OR (especially)
both, send a quick email to me (not to the list, unless it's a general
discussion item).  Include the model and year, so I can narrow down
the numbers.  I have Joel Walker's stats, I'll try to figure the
%-ages and let you all know.

Many thanks,
Rodney
