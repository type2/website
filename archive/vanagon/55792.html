Subject: Re: Needed - EV Oil Filters



&gt;Ouch! What's the difference with the EV filters? I though the Audi 5 
&gt;cyl used the same old VW filter used since the early 70s. Is it like 
&gt;the Corrado filter with a big nut on the end, or what?
&gt;
&gt;Around here, the dealer is $6.50 for a standard gas VW filter, $7.50 
&gt;for the diesel, haven't checked on the EV though. $8.75 = abput $12 
&gt;CDN though...

That's a good question.  I always thought that the Eurovan and 5 cyl Audi 
engines were exactly the same.  The VW part numbers for the two filters are 
different, though.  Out of curiosity, has anyone tried an Audi filter in a 
EV?
