&gt; flashlight/wet rag routine deleted. 

I'll try that.
&gt; 
&gt; also check the tension of the a/c belt. it might be real loose.

Done it.

&gt; 
&gt; and for all:
&gt; Running AC during off-months info. deleted.

I did this every month or two.  Obviously not enough.

&gt; 
&gt; considering the cost of freon these days, i think i'll keep running the
&gt; system this winter.

I have to be more diligent about this (and more frequent).

&gt; &lt;maybe it's just the grits i stuffed around the compressor?&gt;

I guess my stuffing in the quiche just doesn't cut it.  ;)
