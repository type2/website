Same thing happened to us heading home from the in-laws on New Years 
day-15 miles into a 900 mile trip home to be back at the grind on the 
2nd.  When I finally decided the gas fume smell didn't belong to vehicles 
in front of us (there weren't any) we pulled over in a panic in 
Rochester, (western) Washington; cleared the SO, kids, dogs, parrot etc, 
gave emergency instructions on fire extinguisher use ('forget the 
bus-spray me 1st!), jumped into the Ben Davis', grabbed the toolbox &amp; did 
my well practiced inverted low-crawl. (&amp; we ALL carry our tools, 
overalls, various clamps, bits of hose, wire, tape, etc everywhere we go, 
don't we?)

Anyway - &amp; this is an '87 2wd - it was a factory way-too-short piece of 
fuel hose on the FI return circuit, right where you said it smelled 
worst-passenger's side, rear, where it goes through the firewall: *just* 
barely long enough to make a connection, *if* the engine isn't moving 
around (normal movement, that is).  It's a slip-on with hose clamps (not 
VW's previous genius engineering that relied on friction w/o clamps).

&amp; so where do we get a coupla feet of four mm hose in a town of ~100 
people on New Years day? - why, right across the street at the local NAPA 
store, open for a few hours for the loggers (lumberjacks to those of 
y'all east of the Rockies); no, they didn't have 4mm, but the 5/32&quot; they 
*gave* me is still back there, with a nice tie-wrapped loop to allow 
normal engine movement.  (They were enjoying the show, hoping they'd be 
able to roust the local volunteer FD, &amp; generally took pity on us).

Austins_at_svpal_dot_org - '84 Kawi (*real*) 900 Ninja; '92 (fake-8v)GTI;'77 
Rabbit w/engine rebuild by my 16 yr old daughter so she could have some 
wheels; &amp; the never-to-be-forgotten '70 bus w/power by Chevrolet, 
nee'Corvair (another *long* story)

(&amp; she retorted-'but I remember you drove the Ford when the belt broke 
and you said it was OK!')
