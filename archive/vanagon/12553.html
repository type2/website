&gt;&gt;I don't want a suped up vehicle but I plan on keeping it a long time. I
&gt;&gt;really like its versatility.  I want to learn and I want a good result
&gt;&gt;without too much frustration. We do not have a great workshop to work in
&gt;&gt;either, I live in a condo with a carport. We have the Bently manual and
&gt;&gt;Alex has done this sort of thing before, so my advisor is trusted once we
&gt;&gt;decide what to do (I hope). 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Please tell me everything I need to know. Recommend a place to buy the
&gt;&gt;engine if you can that is reliable and low cost. I will be grateful and may
&gt;&gt;even send cookies (I know how to do that!) Thanks.

This sounded to me a rebuilt wasserbox by VWoA from your local VW dealer
is the way to go. Is it around $2200, said someone on the list?  Labor is
not included. This route is probably the least trouble one.

If the engine has minor problems then I would rebuild it myself. Buy all needed
parts from VW dealer.
