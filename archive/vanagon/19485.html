&gt; Tried to find the swivel feet at a FLAPS, but they only had the ones for

&gt; type IV engines&quot;) are larger. 
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, JCWhitney advertizes them as &quot;for all air-cooled VWs&quot;
&gt; and gives only one reference number.

  I have a couple catalogs that indicate 7mm adjusting screws for 1700cc
  type IVs and 8mm screws for the 1800 and 2000cc versions. Don't know
  about swivel feets in either size though.
