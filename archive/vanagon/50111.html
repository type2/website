&gt;Donald,I just started dealing wiht Volkmotosport in Ca. They seem to be
real helpful and pretty competitive on price. Try'em you'll like 'em

&gt;I have an 84 Vanagon GL with a Mazda bumper in the rear.  The PO was retired
&gt;from the auto &quot;junk yard&quot; business and had bought the vanagon totaled and
&gt;rebuilt it for his daughter and son-in-law.  I'll have to take a photo and
&gt;post. It is a bit of a curiosity.  Karen named the Vanagon Ma-Van.  I do
&gt;wonder what other hybrid parts I'll find.
&gt;
&gt;As for Camelback VW, I was excited when I found they offered an Internet
&gt;discount, then discouraged when quoted prices...
&gt;
&gt;rod bearings $5.60 ea. half piece (2 per rod)
&gt;distributor drive gear $39.60
&gt;camshaft $231.69
&gt;muffler clamp $38.03
&gt;muffler $223.80
&gt;brake shoes $61.88

&gt;&gt;A leaking rear heater core has caused me to investigate parts sources other
&gt;&gt;than local Atlanta dealers and local FLAPS.  I assumed that the rear heater
&gt;&gt;valve was the culprit and ordered a new one from Camelback VW in
&gt;&gt;Phoenix--total...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I also ordered a new bumber from Volks Motor Sports for $135... New bumpers
&gt;cost $395 from the dealer.
&gt;&gt;Looking forward to having a pristine rear bumper on my van.
