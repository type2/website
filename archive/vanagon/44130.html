&gt; Hello all.
&gt; 
&gt; I just got my West Coast Metric Catalogue, which I was dutifully perusing,
&gt; when I noticed it lists a seal for Westys which goes on the drivers-side
&gt; rear panel, where that body piece is that they put in to look like the
&gt; place where the middle sliding door track goes on the passangers side (I'm
&gt; having trouble describing just what, I hope you get the idea).  The piece
&gt; is part &quot;N&quot; on page 121 of catalogue 15, part #211-800 &quot;beading, side door
&gt; raling cover&quot;.  What is this, anyone know?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Eric,

&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I discovered this last weekend, that it's not a good idea to tow a bus
&gt; with just a tow dolly, when you have to load the rear end on the dolly (
&gt; like I did with my automatic).  Just thought I'd pass this along...

Well if you check out your bus you'll see that the driver's and passenger's side 
both have the removeable panel with a rubber seal behind it.  I guess this is 
because VW did offer buses with sliding doors on both sides (although they were not 
very common -- I think it was an option).

So the part you describe is for the drivers _OR_ passenger side rail cover.
