&gt; am considering looking for a synchro westy, or a regular one. here is my
&gt;question:
&gt;
&gt;what is the difference in fuel economy between the synchro and an
&gt;equivalent 2wd.

I have an 87 Syncro and an 88 Auto trans Vanagon.  They both get about the
same MPG.  I think a 2wd manual trans would get about 1-2MPG better.

&gt;can a synchro be used for daily transport without too much fear of
&gt;ex$pensive breakdowns.

Just one data point, but my 87 Syncro has nealy 150,000 miles and NO Syncro
related breakdowns.  I have had to replace the front CV loint boots once
each, but other than that the van's Syncroness hasn't cost me any additional
maintenance or repairs.  I have done my share of off-roading in my Syncro as
well too.  I've heard of several other Syncro owners that have had to have
transmissions and/or driveshafts reapired/replaced though.  I think I've only
heard of 1 replacement of the front diff/viscous coupling.

By the way, If you do any computer classifieds searches for Syncros you'll
likely get better results spelling Syncro the way VW does without the 'h'.

Let us know if you have more questions or buy a Vanagon.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
