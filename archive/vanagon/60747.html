Subject: 84 1st gear shift problem

Shifting into 1st gear has become a problem. It feels like I am in gear but when I let 
out the clutch, I'm in neut. Went undernieth, found the seal where the shift rod comes 
out of the trans. leaking, the plastic ball in the vertical connection to the horizontal 
rod running foward has yellowed and does not look right, and the two plastic bushings 
along the horizontal rod have play (about 1/8th inch). It feels like an adjuctment 
problem because if I push real hard I can get it in first, and occasionally it will just 
go into first. Has anyone else had this problem? Vanagon is a 84 with around 170,000
on the clock. Any help would be MORE than appreciated.

TIA
