Sorry!!  My email address is jdw50796_at_uxa.cso.uiuc_dot_edu -=- something
got screwed up on my last message and I can't subscribe to the list. Thanks!

&gt; Hi.

&gt; I have been looking for a microbus for some time now and to no avail.
&gt; If anybody knows of any microbi for sale in the midwest area (i'm in
&gt; IL) I would appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Jeff
