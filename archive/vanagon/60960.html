&gt;  insurance rates (except for the miles-driven stuff)???
&gt;  

I have an 85 Westy that I get about a $10 discount on my insurance for
because its a 'safe' vehicle.  About 2 years ago, I finally found out why
from the insurance adjusters at my insurance company.

Three reasons:
1.  People who tend to own the Vanagons are generally more mature and thus
safer drivers.
2.  The pasengers ride so high that when an accident occurs (with a standard
car), the impact is below the level of the passengers.  The survival and
injury rate is much better because of this compared to cars and pickup
trucks.  (This is also some of the reasoning behind the heavy, hugh school
busses).
3.  Statistics of accidents and injuries are better than other vehicles.

I'm a firm believer in this 'impact above the passenger' theory.  I've seen
numerous accidents with jeeps and other elevated vehicles where the
passengers were okay, yet the passengers of the car suffered impact related
injuries.
