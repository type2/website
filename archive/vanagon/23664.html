&gt;Now I can understand my version, Joe Fournier's version...but I am
&gt;a bit puzzled at Unkle Joel from Allybammah's version. A Mercedes??

hey! this was in Montgomery, the Capital city, and folks down there THINK
they is sofie-stick-ated. :)

&gt;Who are you trying to kid there Joel...the ACTUAL Allybammah version
&gt;involves:
&gt;A 53 Ford Stepside Pick-up with a rifle rack, 3 original fenders,
&gt;mounted on a Chevy Blazer frame with a 427 w/hydramatic and
&gt;straight pipes, a light bar with one working light (to offset
&gt;the missing one from the right front fender) and 4 coon dogs for
&gt;$10!!

shows how much YOU know. NOBODY would ever sell FOUR coon dogs for less than
$200!!!! :)
