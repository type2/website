&gt; 
&gt; Should I leave the refrigerator on off of the battery during the summe?  Or should I
&gt; shut it off when I turn the van off...(I have been shutting it off)
&gt; 
I know this contradicts other advice you have received, but this is my
experience... I nearly always forget to turn it off, sometimes leave it
on for months.  No harm done.



&gt; Can I use the propane for the refrigerator while driving?
Sure.  It might blow out, might not.  Mine works fine until I hit high
altitudes.  (It is jetted for lowlands).
