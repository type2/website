rear. complete with ball. I ordered this from U-Haul I think, cost was $80-
$90. Will ship UPS for $40. Like New.

Listees, 

Had I heard of Branard's U Haul hitch, I would have considered one. I was
warned that the &quot;towing eyelet&quot;  was a &quot;lashing&quot; or a tie-down device for
shipment of the vehicle.  I have not confirmed that information.

Pep Boys sells a Valley Mfg. Co. hitch for about $150.00 installed.  I've
had one for about a year. It attaches INSIDE the bumper which must be
removed, and later replaced. The procedure required that two 1&quot; cuts be
made on the bottom side of the bumper, out of sight, about two inches
apart. The resulting bridge between the two cuts is then bent up into the
bumper. The tongue extends permanently about 4 inches and the ball is
attached as needed.  The tongue is a shin havoc until one gets used to its
presence.

I pull an '84 Coleman 4' x 6' utility trailer with 8&quot; wheels with a
Fibreglas top 4 times a year between Austin, TX and Palm Springs, CA. 
Rated tongue weight  of the hitch is about 150 pounds and load weight that
I pull is about 900 pounds. I have a slow pull in the early morning up the
Chiriaco Summit ( it looks to be at least a 12 per cent grade) in
California, but the rest of the route on Interstate 10 is without incident.

If you consider this option, you may have to stay with the PB service
manager while you read the installation directions out loud to each other.
In my first conversation on the subject, the installer recommended
modifications to the exhaust system! Let the buyer beware.

If anyone wants the model numbers, etc., e-mail me, and I'll look in the
files.

Usual disclaimers apply......
