Subject:       security systems for sale,  east coast only

Esat coasters,

My wife is selling the best security system for 
Vanagon/Westy?home/camp/garden/personal... she has four AKC 
registered Rottweiler puppies on the Market.  These are the Big Boned 
Type and are more intimidating looking than they actually are.  She 
is asking $600.00 a piece,  they come with a warrantee and have been 
health checked.  If you are interested call Martha at 
          Kloabauterman Kennels
          908-995-9666
