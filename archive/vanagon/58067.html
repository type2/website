Subject: '81 air conditioner

I am having to remove the engine from my '81 westie to rebuild it.  While
doing this, I plan to remove the air conditioning, as I have never used it.
 I understand from the PO that there is something wrong with it, probably
with the compressor.

Anyway, is there anything special I need to do to be rid of this?  Do I
have any special electronics or engine controls?  What is the easiest way
to get the parts out of the front?  If I remove the air conditioning, can I
install a glovebox?  Is removing this a good or bad idea?

Second, assuming I go ahead and take it out, does anybody want it?  If you
come and remove it, it's yours. (AZ) If I remove it, compensate me some for
the work, and pay the freight.  Or maybe trade.

Thanks,

Bill
