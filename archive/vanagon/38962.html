Subject: Re:  Hatch Struts

Due to overwhelming response:

Hatch struts on the People's bus are numbered as follows:
RB8795065
G 110/93
Came from Trak Auto in MD. No manufacturer listed.
Note that the connector on the liftgate side is a hole rather than a socket
as per OEM.  Causes chafing.  Oooh that smarts.

Also saw in JC Whitney Cat #587D, (page 7) liftgate hatch struts for Vanagon
_at_ $19.99 for 84-93, $21.99 for 80-83
312-431-6102  Since this is supposed to be OEM requirements, and you don't
need to leave the comfort of your own chair, I'd try them first.
