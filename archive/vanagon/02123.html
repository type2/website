 Hi,
	If my girlfriend (Judy, BTW) and I want to join the trek we'll need to
meet up with it in spring (earlier the better for us) and combine it with
a US tour. Can anyone offer advice about the practicality of this, in
particular we'd need to buy a reasonably reliable &amp; habitable camper (in
California? New Mexico?) and insure it and then sell it after the trip.
 Unless, of course, someone could lend us one? We'd be happy to leave a
generous deposit &amp; promise to look after it :-).

 Could I get some idea of cost &amp; availability of a camper fitting this spec.
and maybe what it would cost to insure? Would we be able to take an out of
state van into California? How hard would it be to sell at the end of the trip?

 This is a serious possibility if these problems can be worked out, Hell we
might even be able to manage the whole trip!

Cheers,
        W.
