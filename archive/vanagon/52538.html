 He sent the heads back.  You folks on this news group had warned me to 
 watch out for cracks in rebuilt heads.  Thanks.  He found some new heads 
 for only $100 more each.  Considering the cost of the job this seamed a 
 good investment.  (I know cost, time and available resources may be 
 different for each of us.)

Were the new heads German or the repops from Spain.  The Spanish heads have a
tendancy to drop valve seats, even on the waterpumpers.
