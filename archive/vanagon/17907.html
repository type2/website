Subject: Pollution control on a '76

My '76 2 liter had the pollution control devices (whatever they were)
removed by a previous owner. Does anyone know what replacing this stuff
entails?  If I was going to register it on the East coast would I need to
replace the stuff? The bus seems to run fine without it--would it run
better with?
