Subject: FS: 1974 Bus


-   74 Passenger Bus. Very Restorable
-   Minimal surface rust, a few small dings, otherwise body is straight.
        (READ: NO MAJOR CANCER)
-   odomoter has 45,xxx miles on it.
-   engine leaks oil at pushrod tube seals.
-   engine runs good.
-   New brake pads, cylinders, rotor(1), caliper (1), front hoses.
-   Great tires.
-   New KYB gas adjust shocks (4)
-   2 new CV boots, 1 replaced cv joint. (used, but good)
-   Stylin' black and white cow pattern seat covers.(These can be left
    with me if they don't fit your style.)
-   New black carpet from WCM. NICE!!
-   Insulated on floor and behind panels with heat sheilding insulation
    from JCW.
-   Single Holley Carb w/ 009 distributor

   We paid $1400 for the bus, which around here is not bad for
   a relativly rust-free running bus. I have invested over $2500 in
   parts in addition to the purchase price. (I have the receipts)
   I know it is not the best time of year to sell but it must go
   SOON!!!!!   Would like $2500 obo.
