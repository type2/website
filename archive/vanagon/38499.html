Subject: Fuel gauge sender on 60's split

Having realized that the fuel gauge on my recently purchased '64 doesn't work, 
I headed to the tank to investigate. Lo and behold, was I surprised (not 
really) to find there was no wire heading from the sender to the gauge! There 
is just one wire coming out of the sender, which is grounded to the roof of 
the engine compartment. There is also a mystery wire coming from the cab which 
is not connected to anything. Gee, what a coincidence.

My question is: There only appears to be one connection to the sender. Should 
I disconnect the ground and attach the gauge wire? Or is a ground neccesary as 
well? If so, where do I connect it? Both wires to the same connection? 

Thanks for the help!
