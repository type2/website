&gt; anyway, anybody ever heard of/dealt with these folks?? just curious.
&gt; the ad has a neat picture of a 71 camper towing a custom made trailer
&gt; (made from the two rear ends of other buses).

I met one of the guys from VW Bus Heaven at the LIMBO meet at Duxbury
beach Mass.
He seemed pretty cool, he gave me his card and he told me his name
which I have now forgotten. (It's not on his card, I still have that)

Othher than knowing that one of them is friendly, I can't give you much 
info.
