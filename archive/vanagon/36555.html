&gt;
&gt;Bob,
&gt;
&gt;I sent this letter to the Air Cooled VW list and thought I'd send it to you
&gt;too in case you had any ideas. (I asked you some questions a few weeks ago
&gt;about sand seals)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for listening
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ok, so here's the situation.  Three weeks ago I call up Bergmann and order a
&gt;new AS21 case, hyd lifters, full flow and cut for 90.5's.  Finally,
yesterday
&gt;my case arrives at home.  Unfortunately, I'm here in NY 3 1/2 hours away.
 So
&gt;tonight I ask my parents to look at the stuff that came and make sure it's
&gt;all there.  While on the phone, my dad was looking at the case.  He's
reading
&gt;the numbers off it and it turns out to be an AS41!!!!!  Now I am really
&gt;confused.  I never knew that these cases were around (new) anymore nevermind
&gt;someone trying to sell them.  I am really pissed.  Does anyone know where
&gt;these cases are from?????  Any chance they are just mis marked AS21's???  (I
&gt;thought I heard about this before)  I am prepared to do battle with bergmann
&gt;tommorow!!  Any help/suggestions appreciated.  The case was marked as shown
&gt;below and at least appeared new.
&gt;

Dear Scott,

I've known Bernie for more than twenty years. I have used his services,
especially his hydraulic cam-follower modification, with excellent results
and have had no cause for complaint.  On that basis, I have recommended him
to others.  

Like Bernie, I've run a VW-oriented business (Empirical Engineering).  Doing
so taught me the most valuable asset a small businessman can have is a good
reputation.  In light of that, and since your complaint was directed to me
apparently as a result of my recommendation of Mr. Bergmann, I felt it vital
that the matter be resolved.  But this is not as straight-forward as it may
appear.  I have had no business relationship with Bernie other than as a
satisfied customer.  To intercede on behalf of a third party in what could be
a frivolous complaint might well be seen as meddling in his affairs.

I went to Bernie's shop and spoke with him.  He is expanding, installing new
machines. I spent more than an hour with him, during which I raised the
question of customer complaints in general, not mentioning your complaint
specifically.  His responses, or lack of response in some cases, revealed a
side of Bernie I never knew existed.  

For the last week I've tried to work out how best to deal with the matter.
 It has not been an easy time.  I went back to Bernie's shop today with a few
very specific questions, none of which were answered to my satisfaction. 

I'll no longer be doing business with Bernie Bergmann or with his company.
 And I will no longer recommend his goods or services.  I deeply regret
having recommended Bernie Bergmann to others in the past.

You may have suffered some loss as a result of my recommendation of Bernie
Bergmann and for that I am sincerely sorry.  I hope you will appreciate that
I too have suffered a loss in this matter, and of something far more valuable
than gold.
