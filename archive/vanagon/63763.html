Subject: Hot Air

Could you please try to answer a question for me? I have a 1985 VW
Westphalia with a 1.9 litre. The front passenger seat (which is situated on
top of the battery compartment) gets as hot as fire on hot days. I looked
under the chasis under the passenger seat and found a 21/2 to 3 inch
cardboard pipe which extends about 5 inches from the body but isn't
connected to anything. I realize that hot outside air under the van is
being drawn up under the seat. Now for the question.
As I cannot find anything nearby for it to hook up to could it be a vent of
some sort to vent battery gas? What is its purpose and can I plug it or
find out where it supossed to connect to? Help me if you can.
