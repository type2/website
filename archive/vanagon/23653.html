&gt;Would like some suggestions on ways and means to get the van (the &quot;Villa&quot;)
&gt;level when camping, without too much fuss and jigs.

I use an extra Vanagon jack and place the two jacks at the two corners that
will level the van the best.  I've not had to extend the jack so far that the
tire was actually suspended off the ground, just releaved of part of its
load. Just don't forget to REMOVE them BEFORE driving off!  As for making
sure that it's really level - I just eyeball it.

Have fun camping
