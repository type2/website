Subject: Re: Oil filter cooler hoses

I just did it to my 91 3 weeks ago...$19 per hose from the dealer..I
only had to remove the oil filter...and used a cork to plug the other
hose i moved out of the way. Use visegrips/or channel locks on the
clamp.good luck

&gt; mine are solid pieces of iron oxide)? It may prove necessary to remove the
&gt; oil filter to get at them. Is there any &quot;easy&quot; way of preventing the oil
&gt; filter screw on plate from getting drenched in whatever coolant is hanging
&gt; around in those hoses? I found I could not pinch the spring clamps after
&gt; draining the cooling system over the weekend (at least with the exhaust pipes
&gt; and the oil filter still on), any suggestions? Thanks in advance...
