Subject: Re: Parents are cool!

Well as one of these doting parents who bought the son a Bug last week it's
nice to know that secretly we are appreciated ...even if you don't wanna be
seen with us!
BTW I offered Hal the chance of a Bay (Bubble front to you guys?) but he
scorned it..seems blatting in an open top beetle is REALLY COOL.
&quot;When I was young I wore my hair long to make a statement. When I got older I
cut it to fit the corporate image look. Now I'm in my forties..I wear a hat.&quot;
Kinda struck a chord....
