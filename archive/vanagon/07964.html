I went by the motor place today, and my motor is done, but I don't have
the cash to get it yet :(

And other bad news, my case was bad :( so I have to cough up an extra
$150 for that :( :( :(  unless I can come up with another case, and then
_I_ have to take it apart, and they'll charge me $25 to clan and check it,
and if that one is bad, too, then I'm still screwed :( :( :(  

They gave me the case. It has a small crack in the bellhousing above
#3.  The motor ran fine with the crack before, so what's the problem?
Can this case be used for anything?

(Sigh!)

I also looked at trannies, and they have them for $265.  They are done
by Carter's Gearbox Shop, in southern Cal.  Anyone have any opinions on
them?
