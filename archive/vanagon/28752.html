I would like to present  the following, with a few words of endorsement.....

I have personally known both of the last 2 owners of this particular 
vehicle, and I have done some small amount of work on the bus for each of 
them.  I have also helped the current owner find a shop here in lancaster, 
and have provided advice and counseling on procedures, schedules, and etc.  
In my opinion as a professional mechanic, I think this is a Good Camper.

Of course, YMMV; there is no way to predict future performance....but the 
vehicle has been well maintained.  e-mail to frmrgile_at_aol_dot_com, or back to me 
and I will forward.
