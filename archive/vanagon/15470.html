&gt; I need a jack for my '81 vanagon.  Does anyone have an extra they'd
&gt; be intrested in selling?
&gt; 
Although I suppose you mean a stock jack, I highly recommend that
everyone who works on their bus have a good,sturdy floor jack. I got the
Sears Craftsman 2-ton floor jack for $50.00 on sale. You can get their
super heavy duty 3 ton deluxe jack for only $100.00. It makes everything
much easier to have a good wheeled jack, especially for pulling early
bus engines and such.
 Anyway, just my thoughts...
Richard
