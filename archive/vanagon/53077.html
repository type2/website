Subject: Re: How common is the factory sunroof?

Here, in Montr=E9al I see regulary a burgondy Vanagon 86? (square headlight
and chrome bumpers) with a sunroof. So VW Canada could have a slightly
different practice.

It seems also that since the disparition of VW Canada, that there continue
to have different commercial pratice. They seem to not sell, or not really
advertise the Winnebago Eurovan (but I know that 2 dealers in Montreal
region have one to sell).

Non Vanagon contents: A mechanics told me that my Jetta 91 is suppose to
have an anti-vibration device (sort of rubber/steel weight) under to engine
to reduce the noise over 3000RPM. Is someone knows the first year of this
device (I think that the dealer remove this part without asking me :-( )
