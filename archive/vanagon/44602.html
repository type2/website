Subject: Joel...'64 Standard

I hate to post this so soon after Bob Hufford. 

After reading his tale, I am going through all the classic seven stages: 
anger, denial, depression, and whatever the other three are, except the 
last one, acceptance. But no sour grapes, as long as Bob promises to 
bring this bus for allof us to see at the Labor Day Buses By The Arch! 

Maybe I see a pattern here. Buy and faithfully suffer through several 
&quot;bus bones&quot;, and then providence smiles down on you, and your dreams 
come true... 

So I have started down the road. I made a deal on the derelict 64, and 
it is home. The full, illustrated story is under &quot;Derelict '64 Microbus&quot; 
on the Syncro Westie page: 
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm

and seriously, Bob, congradulations.

Tom F.
