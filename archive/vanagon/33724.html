Subject: Bulletproof tires


Odd thread for a VW list...

The term 'bulletproof' was applied to tires during the First World War, when
Dunlop developed a 'Semi-Pneumatic' tire for military vehicles.  It was a
solid rubber tire with a beaded rim, designed to be fitted to wheels intended
for pneumatic tires.  'Real' trucks still used flat steel wheels with solid
rubber 'tires'.

The bulletproof tires worked reasonably well on the European front, where
most tires failed not from bullet wounds but from being cut by the many
pieces of shrapnel in the muddy roadways.  In the Middle East, the
bulletproof tires proved impractical, although their greater weight-handling
ability saw them used on the rear wheels of many vehicles.

During the Spanish Civil War a truck tire stuffed with straw was the standard
'bulletproof' tire.

Nowadays there are a variety of ways of making a tire 'bulletproof' but most
use the same principle as the early Dunlops:  A solid mass of rubber or
something else, unlikely to be damaged by a rifle bullet or disabled by a
shrapnel cut.  Some designs use a urethane foam filler that provides both a
fair ride and reasonable life.  Plys are almost always steel.  Such tires are
enormously heavy, upsetting a stock suspension.  They are also very
expensive.

Humvee tires use a pneumatic jacket around a 'fail-safe' core-tire.  The
jacket may be inflated or deflated while the vehicle is in motion, allowing
it to adjust its traction to the terrain.  Should the pneumatic jacket be
damaged, the fail-safe core will usually provide enough support for the
vehicle to withdraw under its own power.

As for Volkswagen content, the bulletproof design is spelled T-U-B-E.  If you
plan to go off pavement, run tubes in your tires.  You can patch a tube,
drive on.  Tubeless tires can kill you.  Try pumping up a tubeless tire down
in Baja -- or the Yukon -- with your 12v air-compressor.
