Subject:      '95 Winnebago in Canada...

FROM: H YATES


Hi Everyone.  I had a chance to checkout the new Winnebago Eurovan at the
car show yesterday in Vancouver, BC.  I thought I would share my thoughts
and comments about it, if I may.

The vehicle on display was all white.  No stripes (thankfully!), and no
external markings indicating 'Winnebago ' on the pop roof.  There is a
luggage rack above the cab now (like Westy's of previous years), and
a pop top roof.  The roof design was boxy like the Vanagon Westys, and
and probably is about 4 or 5 inches above the Eurovan roof.  The luggage
rack was a bit chincy.  There are no rungs to keep one's belongings
above the bottom of the rack to keep things dry should it rain.  I also
noted that the construction of the roof was not as strong as the roof
on Vanagon Westys.  I was able to deflect the fiberglass quite easily
using one hand and squeezing the edge of the luggage rack together.
The tie-downs for the luggage rack was two black steel straps fastened
to the bottom of the luggage rack at each end.  The roof was supported
by two gas struts, half way long the roof, and a scissor mechanism
at the rear.  The roof had a skylight in it as well.  The inside of the
roof was vinyl.  I wonder how it will be for condensation.

The interior was on the grey colour scheme.  Very pleasant.  The cab
was carpeted, but the camper part was not.  It has an unusual kind
of lino flooring.  Never seen that material before, but it looked
very durable.  Stainless steel is back!  The sink, stove area is all
stainless steel, and spacious.  The fridge is a 3-way variety and is
on the bottom of the cabinet rack.  It is huge.. 1.5 times larger than
my Westy's (at least).  There seems to be lots of cupboard space in the
van, and is nicely, neatly finished.  There was a built in propane heater
along with a grey water holding tank, fresh water tank, and propane tank.
There were LED instruments for the RV battery, grey water, fresh water,
and something else that I can't remember right now (figures!).  At the
rear of the van was a water hose with nozzle to hose yourself off I
guess, as well as some storage bins on the left side.  Under the rear
bed, there was the electrical centre which had the 110/12 volt converter
charger, etc, as well as a deep cylce lead acid battery, and water
storage.

This is a big van.  It is also heavy.  With the wheels on the Eurovan
at the extreme ends of the vehicle, and with the stretch wheelbase,
it wouldn't take too much effort to scrape the propane and grey
water plumbing going over humps in roadways or campgrounds, IMHO.
The asking price was $38,000 (Canadian).  I was also told that there
won't be any coming in until August/95.  I find that hard to believe,
as why bring in a camper at the end of camping season.

The cab had a/c, a new stereo with removable face plate, cruise, and
the standard swivel/tilt/arm rest equipped seats.  Headrests were
for four passengers. This vehicle had a 5 speed transmission, with
full, plastic (yuk) wheel covers.

The GVW is around 6000 lbs.  So, when is that VR6 coming?

Anyway, folks, if I missed something, let me know.

Thx.
Harry
