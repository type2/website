Why, HECK YES!  My 67 Bus went for more than two years of regular driving
(I put about 25K miles on it in one year) without any major repairs.  If I
wasn't trying to hot dog by running the dual webers and racing datsun
pickups out of the intersections (which, incidentally, made me have to
replace the front tranny mount a LOT more often than I really wanted to),
and ran it with a stock engine and carburetion, it was very reliable.

It'll take the EV a while to match that bus'es reliability, cause it had
375K miles on it when I sold it. I do like the AC, though.
