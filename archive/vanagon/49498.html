&gt; Perhaps a bit overdue, but thought I should give an update 
&gt; on Weddle Engineering.  I removed my transmission back in 
&gt; August (16th) for some warrenty work by German Transaxle and 
&gt; the installation of a Weddle Locker.  Within 24 hours German 
&gt; Transaxle had the unit repaired, the Weddle Locker installed, 
&gt; and the assembly ready to ship.  Then they received a call 
&gt; from John Weddle regarding a bad batch of gears.  As luck 
&gt; would have it - I ended up with the bad gears.  The good news 
&gt; is that it wasn't shipped to Fairbanks and installed in my 
&gt; vehicle.  The bad news is that my transaxle is still in Bend, 
&gt; Oregon waiting for a Weddle Locker.
&gt; 
&gt; The latest news from Weddle Engineering is that it will be at 
&gt; least 30 days before they can supply a locker.  In my case 
&gt; that was the main reason I elected to send the transmission 
&gt; out, as the warrenty problem - slipping out of first gear on 
&gt; hard deceleration was something I could live with.  I made sure 
&gt; that German Transaxle had the Locker in stock before I sent out
&gt; my transaxle - but sometimes things go wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; I have nothing but praise for both companies.  German Transaxle 
&gt; offered to modify my transmission for the same price as the 
&gt; Weddle Locker and install a VW syncro locker.  I have decided 
&gt; against this as my wife is the primary driver and is not excited
&gt; about needing to slow to 5 miles per hour to engage the locking
&gt; differential.  Additionally, I would need to secure, purchase, 
&gt; and install the vacuum control system.
&gt; 
&gt; My plea is simple - if anyone has an older Weddle locker that is
&gt; not currently being used, I could sure use one to get my vehicle
&gt; back on the road.  the Van is jacked up outside (as my garage is
&gt; not tall enough to allow the transmission replacement.  Last night
&gt; we had our first snow.  The way the weather goes, in 30 days, I'll
&gt; be installing the transmission in a blizzard.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Fred
&gt; 
    Fred,

        You are lucky, to be at this point. Don't install a lock
        anything in a street vehicle!. Try a limited slip axle.
        I thought I saw an article sometime ago with an outfit
        for Vanagons.

        Locking axles are dangerous if you don't know what your
        doing. They tend to steer you straight when you want to
        turn.     Trust Me I have one!  And your Wife Is going
            to drive this?
