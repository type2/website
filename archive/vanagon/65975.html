Subject:      PS: Microfiche: How to order yours.......

My collection of Microfiche date back 20 years.  So I should have what
your looking for.   I do have type 3, 4, Ghia and 181.  I also found
that the beetles are broken up into 2 films,  1200-1300= Standard
beetles and 1302- 1303= superbeetles.  The standard beetles do go back
into the 60's  I found a couple of pre '67 bus films but I think they
will stay with me.  However, I can be persuaded.   Take care.

-Jim
