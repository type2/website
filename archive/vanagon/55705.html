&gt;&gt;How about doing some phenomenal trip with both groups in the year 2000
&gt;&gt;to mark the turn of the month, year, decade, century, and millenium?  

&gt;&gt;How about a marathon trip to somewhere REALLY obscure for most of
&gt;&gt;us - like Tierra del Fuego?

&gt;It's certainly possible to do this trip, however.  Tim Cahill did it in 23
&gt;1/3 days in 1987, from Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe bay. 

&gt;Tim's biggest complaint was that they didn't have enough time.  He also
&gt;worried about dying a lot.  This isn't a trip for the faint of heart.
&gt;
&gt;My guess for a trip using busses (and the associated break-downs) is 2.5
&gt;months.  Anyone up for this sort of sabbatical?

Wow, what a trip man!
