I have both a CA equipped '80 westi and a non-CA '80 Westi.
I have been reviewing Skip's archives to determine the differences in 
the FI system.  Most of the components are the same, but where there 
are differences, the Bosch name for a component is not the same as 
the Bently or Haynes name.  Could someone provide a description and 
location of the following parts?

ECU - Exchange    non-CA only
(not a clue what or where this is)

Resistor Unit         non-CA only
(is this mounted on the LF firewall consisting of lots of white wires 
attached to white cylindrical objects surrounded by aluminum)

Combi-Relay          different model numbers CA vs non-CA
(is this the fuel pump relay mounted on the LF firewall with a square 
connector from the FI wiring harness and another square connector 
from the main wiring harness?)

Vacuum Limiter      different model numbers CA vs non-CA
(is this the big vacuum biscuit mounted above the engine or the 
deceleration valve mounted on the vertical engine tin or something 
else altogether)

AIr Flow Meter      different model numbers CA vs non-CA
(I assume that this is the Air Flow valve that is the throttle cable 
attaches to?)

BTW what/where are the following parts. They are the same, but I want 
to be educated on my FI system.

Temperature Sensor Coolant

Thermo-Time Switch (NOT the Cold Start Valve)

I am trying to move all the CA equipment from CA bus to the non-CA 
bus &amp; I want to get all the right equipment, but don't want to 
exchange parts unecessarily.

TIA
