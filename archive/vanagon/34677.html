Subject: GREAT BUY ON MICHELIN TIRES-DO YOU WANT THE SAME DEAL?

After asking people many times and investigating the &quot;Tire Threads&quot;or is
that Treads?? I went with the Michelin XZX Reinforced sidewall tires.  They
are great!  They made the bus handle much better and they look good
too...Seems like the bus stands up the way you see them in pictures...not
much tire sag.

Above all they survived off road in Mexico which really impressed me.  One
of my buddies owns a wheel and tire shop in the San Fernando Valley(LA Area)
and said he would put together an inclusive package for anyone who is
interested in purchasing a set and IMHO his work is great.  He can also
arrange to have everything ready ahead of time so if you are from outside
the area and just driving through he can do a quick installation.  I don't
want to post the price because I know we are not supposed have
advertisements on the list.  

BUT,

If anyone is interested please e-mail me privately at joe.chan_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com
