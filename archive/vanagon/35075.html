Subject: Fritz Gets Schmucked (Body work in Van)

So last night at about 2am we get a knock on the door.  Turns out its a cop
asking if that's my VW bus parked on the street.  So I'm thinking that I'm
about to be told about some obscure parking regulation about parking on the
street at night.  You know a hang-on from 100 years ago when they got snow.

But no, it seems some drunk decided to smash into the rear driver side
corner and crunch Fritz up against the telephone pole.  There was quite a
bit of damage, so I don't know if they're going to write it off or not
(since I just got the Kool Seal and rubber seals for the roof I'm figuring
that my luck will make sure that it is).

But any west coast Canajuns out there know of a good VW body shop in the
Vancouver area?  I don't necessarily want the cheapest one since ICBC will
be footing the bill.

Hopefully it doesn't get written off because the panel over the rear driver
side wheel was the only one that had significant rust.  This just may work
out in my favour.

Fritz-less in Vancouver,
Glen
