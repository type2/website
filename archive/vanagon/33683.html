Subject: Re: My '71 bus is pissed at me

I think you're screwed (so to speak).  It sounds like a siezed plug.  Leave
it or torque it out but it sounds like head pulling time.  Take it to a
machine shop and get it helicoilded or exchange it for a rebuilt head.
Eventually the threads in the head get messed up and the plugs get stuck.
Refer to John Muir's book for more detail.  (Personally I take the brute
force approach and break the damned plug off...it's so satisfying!!!) :)

&gt;Well, some people came to look at my '71 bus over the weekend,
&gt;and naturally it chose to run like sh*t that day. They left, saying
&gt;&quot;I'll get back to you&quot; and other politenesses, which at least sounded
&gt;better than &quot;You lying, scumbag hose monster&quot;, which was maybe
&gt;what they were thinking after I'd told them it ran fine but had problems
&gt;with overheating and oil leaks.
&gt;
&gt;I hadn't driven it for a while since getting the V6anagon, and hadn't
&gt;done a tune-up in a while, which became my first suspect. Popped off
&gt;the #2 plug wire, and it broke in my hand. Hmmm, maybe a leetle problem
&gt;with plug wires here... put them on my shopping list.
&gt;
&gt;Put my wrench on the #2 plug, and that sucker did NOT want to come out.
&gt;By putting all the torque on it I could in that cramped engine compartment,
&gt;I could get it to turn ssslllooooowwwlllyyyy, fighting me every inch of
&gt;the way. Yes, I AM turning it in the right direction.
&gt;
&gt;I'm about to put a cheater pipe on my wrench handle, but thought I'd
&gt;ask a few &quot;saner heads&quot; for advice before assaulting those soft aluminum
&gt;heads like that. The engine is stone cold, I haven't run it since the
&gt;weekend.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have any advice on coaxing a reluctant plug out of a VW? This
&gt;plug is actually the easiest one to get to in a bus-- #1 will be tougher,
&gt;being farther from the hatch and under the air cleaner mount (I've already
&gt;lifted out the air cleaner to get more room). Hope #1 doesn't decide to
&gt;display solidarity with its brother.
&gt;
&gt;Frankly I'm not too far from yanking the engine and stuffing a correct
&gt;dual-port one in, in its place (this one is a '70 single-port 1600, with
&gt;Solex 30PICT-3 carb and standard VW bus muffler). Only the $$ are stopping
&gt;me, as usual. Ever notice how few truly rich people drive old VW buses?
&gt;
