I'm selling my camper bus in Champaign, IL. It is clean inside and out, and
is in good mechanical condition. It has 144K mi and 46K on a rebuilt engine.
I am asking $1800. The best way to contact me is to phone _at_

217-352-4446 weekends
309-597-2183 weekday evenings

I have e-mail access only once every 1-2 weeks.

Chris B.
