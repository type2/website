Subject: Re: performance exhaust systems

&gt;
&gt;I have the Bus Stop catalog right in front of me and on page 32 they show
&gt;this &quot;GT Sports System&quot; exhaust (picture 1) for $126 that would apparently fit
&gt;my 75 1.8l fuel injected bus. Has anyone ever tried one of those? 
&gt;
&gt;I think it's rather ugly with its double pair of tail pipes, kinda takes


&lt;snip&gt;


I had a Monsa system like the above, on a '78 2.0l. it was noisier than 
stock, but no major difference in performance. A &quot;gain&quot; of 2~3 horsepower on 
a 3000Lb. vehicle doesn't make a hell of a lot of difference. The noise was 
not unpleasant by any means, maybe on the highway? Ran smoothly. Biggest 
nuisance was trying to work on the beast with the engine running and four 
exhuast pipes blasting hot smelly stuff into your face / chest / crotch. 
Fuel mileage seemed unchanged, the EFI still calls the shots I guess.
         I have seen similiar systems with steel washers welded into the 
ends of the pipes to reduce the area to that of the stock exhaust, the claim 
being that some back pressure was needed for stock engines but not for 
performance engines.         Would I buy another... yes, the price is right, 
mine lasted as long as stock, (sold the bus after 3 years) and installation 
is a snap. Try for an S + S system since I was told they use the thickest 
pipes, this from a friend with a 108mph/6mpg Beetle &quot;sedan stock&quot; class 
racer. And... if ANYONE sees a system for a wasserboxer call me NOW! 
(thanks)                              bye, tim.
