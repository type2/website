G'day all! Another lurker has finally answered the call. Just a few 
updates:

1) In my quest to replace my beauty 69 pop-top, which I sold back in 93 to 
follow my old girlfriend to New Zealand (the things we do for love!), I 
came upon this ad (in Baltimore):

1971 Westy Camper
spent most of its life in Europe, has unique European features/gadgets. 
needs (dual) carb work and fuel system. (He has the parts, but not the 
space or time to fix it). Some rust. 2nd owner. Steven (410) 488-7094

It sounds complete, and there's a guy in his neighborhood threatening to 
buy it and take the engine and ditch the bus. So, I thought I would appeal 
to the kind souls of this list to save this Westy. I'd buy it, but I'm 
afraid I'm no Bob Hoover (sorry Grendel!). Anyway, the usual disclaimers 
apply.

2) For those of you in the Northern California/Nevada area, I'd just like 
to put in an plug for a VW shop that saved our 1992 trip across America. 
Blown engine in our 69 Pop-top, we phoned several places in the 
Davis/Sacramento/Tahoe area, and everyone wanted more than we could afford. 
That is until we happened to pass a huge painting of Bart Simpson AND the 
VW logo on the same wall.  

Turns out to be Bart's Auto in Reno, NV
                1725 E 2nd 
                Reno, NV 89502
                702-329-4349
                Run by Bart Hadel.

He did the engine rebuild, new clutch and plate for $700 installed. Our bus 
was still running strong when we sold (sniff sniff) it a year, and many 
miles later!  

3) If anyone in the Phoenix/LA/Tahoe area has or knows of a decent pop-top 
for sale, could you please post it or e-mail me directly? I hope to be out 
there late this month and would like to find another travelling bus. 

Thanks heaps-sorry this is so long Gerry-happy B'day!
