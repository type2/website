Subject: Signing off tomorow


I'm siging off from vanagon tomorrow...I'm off to Germany on Friday 
morning. I have a visit to Wolfsburg in the works .. both the factory and 
the museum (again). This afternoon I received  a fax from the 
Museum..they're holding a KdF savings stamp book for me!!


I'll have details when I get back.
