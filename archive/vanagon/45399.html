&gt;I bought a EV MV when I really wanted the Westphalia conversion
available
&gt;in the rest of the world. I first saw the Winnebago conversions
stickered
&gt;at 32K and I just saw a listing for them at 28K.  Still a huge massive
&gt;chunk of change.  Anyone on the list have one and care to share how much
&gt;they really cost. 
&gt;
I think Burnsville VW has them for around $25k.  I could call if you
want.
