I always kept an eye out for the lost indian princess Falling Rocks.  
Signs would occasionally remind me to Watch for Falling Rocks.  Of 
course, there was always some long story (which I don't remember) as to 
why this indian princess was lost.  Anybody Know?

...and this was all while traveling in a vw bus naturally :)
