&gt;Correct spelling: Palestinians. It's interesting that breadloafs are usually
&gt;driven by the poor, &quot;terrorists&quot;, or hippies in movies.

actually, in the movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, i think the terrorists were
Libyans. and because terrorists are poor, they have to drive economical,
reliable vehicles ... i.e., vw buses. :)

hippies? i think it has something to do with the resemblance of the bus to
the Great Cosmic Mushroom. or some such nonsense like that. ;)
