Subject:      S&amp;S headers -arrrgh!

I took photos of the system this weekend and should have posted on my web
site later this week. However, after going through the effort of removing
the muffler and fitting the S&amp;S muffler, guess what?  It doesn't fit. Well,
it fits but the mounting straps on the muffler point to places with nothing
to mount to.

Either the muffler does not fit, or the kit I got from the Bus boys was
missing hardware, or the Bus boys shipped me the wrong system. At the
moment my suspicions are that I got the wrong system as the header has
studs mounted near the rear-facing exhaust flanges (where the header mounts
to the head.) for something to bolt to. I don't see anything that would
mount to these studs - unless it is part of the muffler support I'm missing.

Anyway, I emailed S&amp;S tech support and CC'd the bus boys, I'll post what
the result is.
BTW - the bus boys email was returned by their server saying that they had
&quot;exceeded their quota.&quot;  Guess they are not reading their mail.

I did make a temporary bracket to hold the muffler - because that was
easier than reinstalling the original muffler for the moment. Seems to add
a little pep, but it might just be that the replacement muffler is easily
half the weight of the original.
