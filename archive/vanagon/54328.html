Subject: OIL SWITCH ON! Questions from frustrated Westy Owner!

Greetings to the list:

I am posting this question on behalf of a fellow Westy owner who is not
online yet. Problem is as follows, and hope you can help!:


Vehicle:        87 Westfalia.

Oil pressure warning buzzer and indicator light flash and sound
intermittently while driving down the highway. Randomly goes on and off.
Replaced both brown
pressure switch by oil pump and white oil switch in the crankcase.

Original repair was to replace the leaky (white) oil pressure switch in
rear of engine, where the oil was leaking (it was &quot;slinging oil&quot;). Before
replacing switch there was no indication of a problem: No lights, no
buzzer.

The white switch was replaced with a &quot;Downy&quot; from Parts House. Suspecting a
faulty switch, this new switch was then replaced with a new Volkswagon
switch. Still same problem.

Buddy (the owner) said that it does not happen at idle; this happens around
3-4000 rpm, when engine is in fourth or so. Engine is smooth and quiet,
sounds normal (&quot;even quieter than normal&quot;).

At first, Buddy  pulled off the road. Now he states that when this occurs,
he'll turn off the ignition, coast and then re-crank the engine (while on
still rolling). This seems to reset the computer... or resets something.

He stated that the light/buzzer warning happened within 20 minutes of
driving after he replaced the leaky white oil pressure switch the first
time.

Buddy's been building Veedubs from way back, since his Dad owned a junkyard!=
!
(Imagine that one.) So the Westy is parked, avoiding hitting the dealer
repair shop, and awaiting your sagacious advice=8A while Buddy bops about in
his Bug!


Any suggestions would be appreciated!
Thanks in advance.
