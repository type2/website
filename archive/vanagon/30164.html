VW Caravelle Syncro
CAR, December 1989

We were surprised by the depth of the off-road capability of this
4x4 minibus. But whether a luxury spec is a good idea for this kind
of application is for the buyer to decide ...

Judging by the number of four-wheel drive bakkies and big, imported
station wagons one sees around the suburbs these days, the role of the
typical 4x4 vehicle has broadened considerably.  It now serves for quick
trips to the local cafe in between weekend jaunts to the bundu or the
beach.  Imagine, therefore, the appeal of a vehicle that combines true
off-road capability with the people-moving flexibility of a minibus.

It's not a new idea - we remember seeing 4x4 versions of the popular
Mitsubishi L300 minibus in Japan some years ago - but now that
Volkswagen South Africa has added Syncro 4x4 variations to its Microbus/
Caravelle minibus line-up, such a versatile vehicle is within the reach
of (well heeled) local motorists.

The Syncro four-wheel drive system combined advanced design with
functional simplicity. Drive to the front wheels is distributed by a
front-mounted differential/viscous coupling unit which is driven from
the transmission via a propshaft.

This arrangement leaves the time-honed rear-engined layout essentially
unchanged and provides &quot;on demand&quot; four-wheel drive without the driver
having to take his hands off the steering wheel.

It is difficult to tell to what extent all four wheels are being driven,
except of course during rough off-road going, as the viscous coupling
constantly varies the drive being fed through to the front wheels
according to requirements. In practice, Syncro is virtually a full-time
4x4 system as even the slightest variation between front and rear axle
slip - even the minimum amount that occurs in ordinary driving - will
result in some drive going through to the front wheels.

Thus in wet or slippery conditions on a conventional tarred surface,
you can sometimes feel the front wheels pulling the vehicle through
what might conceivably have become a skid. Indeed, the Syncro handles
better than the standard Caravelle thanks to this subtle extra grip,
which balances it nicely when cornering and gets the power down more
smoothly.

Conversely, even off-road the rear wheels do most of the work most of
the time, since more often than you'd imagine, that's all that's
required.  For the driver, it's certainly a &quot;foolproof&quot; system involving
none of the inconvenience and decision making usually required to get
out and lock front hubs, then stopping to select four-wheel drive in
various permutations.  Even the relative complexity of &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot;
ranges has been eliminated and instead, there's just the conventional
VW four-speed gearbox with an extra-low donkey ratio (known as the G
or Gelande gear) added for stringent off-road work.

The front &quot;axle&quot; is the most changed aspect of the Syncro, compared to
a conventional two-wheel drive VW minibus, and a separate subframe
carries the modified upper and lower wishbone independent suspension as
well as the diff/viscous coupling unit. The latter is only marginally
larger than a conventional independent axle final drive unit and is
rigidly mounted in the same manner.

It's a remarkably neat concept with tidy installation and the only
visual give-away is the slightly higher stance of the Syncro models.
The engine and rear suspension are unchanged except for revised ride
heights and slightly stiffer dampers and other mechanicals remain the
same.  Pneumatically operated differential locks are provided front and
rear, while protection plates or rails guard the front diff/viscous
coupling unit, the gearbox/engine and the propshaft against off-road
damage.

If we ignored the extra 17mm of ground clearance and the 205 SR 14
General RV180 commercial radial tyres, the Caravelle Syncro test vehicle
was a dead ringer for the standard version of VW's luxury 'bus.
&quot;No doubt that will change as soon as we drive off,&quot; we thought. &quot;After
all, that heavy duty 4x4 hardware must make some sort of difference.&quot;
It usually does: the steering is often heavy and there are the extra
centrifugal loads, noise and vibration generated by another set of drive
shafts and two gearboxes, to say nothing of an invariably harder ride.

DRAWBACKS MISSING
But the Syncro doesn't subscribe to conventional 4x4 wisdom in its
concepts and is free from the usual drawbacks.  We were surprised to
discover that, if anything, the ride was an IMPROVEMENT on that of the
conventional Caravelle, one of the most comfortable minibuses on the
market. The longer suspension travel provides extra suppleness off-road
or on paved surfaces, while completely avoiding the &quot;oil tanker at sea&quot;
mushiness display by a Range Rover.

The impression holds good for other control aspects too: the gearshift
is easy and relatively light; the clutch is smooth, progressive and
well weighted; the brakes require no more effort than usual and the
power-assisted steering is finger-twirling easy. In fact, you can jump
into a Caravelle Syncro and drive it just as you would your standard
model.  A woman driver who usually avoids 4x4s was quite happy with this
one.

Although gearing is substantially altered, overall it works out at
27,07 km/h per 1000 r/min and the Syncro is quite relaxed cruising at
120 km/h, a gait it will keep up all day.  The four conventional forward
gears are easier to use than the awkward five speed fitted to the normal
Caravelle and in normal driving the only obvious reminder of the
vehicle's 4x4 capability was the way the viscous coupling stiffens up
when reversing, almost as if it isn't happy running in the opposite
direction to normal.  Interestingly, the reverse ratio is an extremely
low 6,030:1 - the same as the donkey gear - which led us to surmise that
it might employ the same gear cluster in order to retain all the same
ratios within the standard gearbox casing.

CAPABLE OFF-ROAD
Off-road, the Syncro display real ability - it's not the image-honed
appliance with limited, occasional capability that its appearance might
suggest.  On our 4x4 test circuit it actually surprised us, although it
soon became obvious that its outright ability was limited by a lack of
clearance under the axles and that imposed by the long front overhang.

The Caravelle Syncro's flexible spoiler had to bulldoze its way through
sand and other material when the nose lifted after descending a steep
slope, and for fear of hanging up on the chassis siderails we avoided
tackling the really deep dongas that have beaten even specialists 4x4s
in the past. But this is serious stuff we're talking about, the kind of
obstacles that even experienced off-roaders in Land-Rover 110s would get
out and mull over before tackling.  The Syncro will breeze through usual
beach or veld terrain.

Its sand capability - even without the tyres deflated - is excellent,
although in contrast to conventional 4x4 practice, you usually use first
gear.  The 2,1i flat-four engine is passingly powerful but not that
torquey in these conditions and you can't afford to let the revs drop
off too far or you'll simply stop, especially on a slope.

However, one of the advantages of the viscous coupling is the smoothly
progressive application of power to the front wheels, ensuring that they
don't spin easily.  This allows you to extricate the vehicle for another
try.

On harder surfaces, the diff locks ensure outright traction comparable
to the best 4x4s, while the donkey gear allows the Syncro to &quot;walk&quot;
slowly over rocks and really rough terrain with limitations imposed only
by its lack of sheer power and ground clearance.  Once the Syncro
characteristics have been sussed out, the vehicle can cope with the
huge Namib dunes conquered by macho 4x4s with massive tyres.

ARMCHAIRS AND VELOUR
The luxury features include comfortable armchairs for all seven
occupants, deep velour trim, central locking, electric windows in front,
electrically adjustable rear-view mirrors, power steering and an
impressive integrated air-conditioning system. This uses a roof-mounted
console that extends the full length of the vehicle and across above the
windscreen, providing eight adjustable vents.

The quality of its mouldings and installation matches that of the top-
notch interior and perhaps the only disadvantage is that it robs the
load area of a little space where it extends down the D-pillars to floor
level.  Fears that the console would limit headroom or the view proved
ill-founded and the cooling capacity appeared abundant.  It cooled the
large interior airspace in a couple of minutes.

The two simple twist controls that operate the system are placed on the
facia within easy reach of front seat occupants and we were pleased to
discover that the air-con does not override the vehicle's normal fresh
air ventilation system which remains intact. This air-conditioning
system is now standard in Caravelles and optional in the 2,1i Microbus
range, removing a long-standing criticism.

The Syncro gets the full Caravelle treatment on the exterior, including
those handsome alloy wheels, twin rectangular headlights and rear window
wash/wipe.  But the observant will notice that the fuel tank filler has
been moved from just behind the driver's door to the right rear, to
fascillitate the relocation of the fuel tank astride the transaxle
instead of its usual position between the front wheels.

With the luxurious Caravelle models one should bear in mind that their
interior layout sacrifices some of the Microbus' flexibility in the
interests of comfort. Particularly relevant in the Syncro version is
that the second row of seats is fixed, while the back row cuts luggage/
utility space to 736/1656 cubic dm, compared to the Microbus' 968/2320
cubic dm.  However, if the optional rear seat design is specified it
folds flat and with the luggage area upholstered by the folding
&quot;mattress&quot; provided, creates a double bed.

TEST SUMMARY
There is little to criticise in the way the Syncro drives, both off-road
and on.  It's a truly practical people-mover that is just as much at
home ferrying the kids to school during the week as it is scrambling
to your favourite mountain fishing stream at weekends. Like any vehicle
with multifarious roles, it's a compromise, but the most successful that
we've yet encountered in this field. For most potential buyers, the only
problem (as always) is likely to be the price, but then a similarly
capable and more capacious Microbus Syncro is avilable for R11450 less.
