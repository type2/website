Subject: Windshield wiper shaft

 Has anyone had to replace a windshield shaft, specifically the driver's
side? How big a job is it?  I was tightening the nut on the wiper arm because
it was slipping and it twisted off. Also is there a good way to keep the arm
from slipping short of torquing the nut down?
