Subject: I'll take both please

	Gotta agree with Ric, Steve, Martha, etc. I already mailed Gerry
asking to be on both lists. I think what will actuallyl happen is that
each list will be a bit smaller than the original, but that cross-replies
and duplicates will inflate both. So be it. But don't displair, Ric,
community comes from shared need and dependence. Whatever its cooled
with, whatever I'm driving, I enjoy reading this list. Soon These Lists.

	Bill
