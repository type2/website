Subject: Re: What size engine came in a '50 or '51 bus?

Eric writes that his 50/51 bus has the engine #1458006. My (brand new in)
December 1956 bug had engine number 1666045, which isn't much greater, and
suggests that the earlier number must be about, say, 10 months older. I'm
assuming the engines were sequential in those days; why not?

By the way, I can't remember my best friends' phone numbers anymore, but I
can remember my first car's SN, Motor #, and, of course, my US Army ID #.
For those old enough to appreciate the difference, it was US, not RA.
