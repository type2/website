&gt; Heh, I tried that once too.  I got Da Boat up to 90 going down a huge

&gt; over 5,000 RPM which is a no-no without a counterweighted crank, and I
&gt; backed off.  Just wanted to peg the speedo so I could say, &quot;I pegged the
&gt; speedo!&quot;.  You get the idea.

I peg my speedo everyday!  Of course the only peg I have is the one on 
zero.  :)  I took the bus up to 5000 RPM once just for the hell of it.  
I estimate that it was about 80 MPH.  My speedo is a little off... it was 
reading around 90, ie.. straight down.  As they say on the Sega 
commercial, &quot;Gee officer, I don't know.  The little arrow stops at 80.&quot;  
Hehe..  I never tried to peg it the other way, I'd have to go ~5500 RPM, 
and I don't have HD lave springs (should soon).  Of course, as Martha 
&quot;Flanel girlie&quot; Rubin and Bob &quot;Al's friend&quot; Kenyon will attest, I don't 
normally drive that fast.
