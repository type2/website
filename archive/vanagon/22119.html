&gt;Subject: Bus body question

Hi all,
Having just finished the rebuild on my '76 Westfalia I am now getting down to
the body work. Nothing real major just some surface rust to prep and a couple
of fastener holes to fill before repainting. I did notice something strange,
though.
On the right rear quarter-panel just North/Northeast of the taillight I
noticed some deep cracks in the paint. While chunking off the bigger pieces I
see some kind of filler stuff that looks like cement (much softer, of course)
under the paint. I think to myself, &quot;Must have been dented&quot;. I lift up the
engine lid and feel around behind the panel but find no evidence of previous
damage or body work. Curious. The original &quot;Kermit-the-Frog&quot; Green is on top
of this filler.
 My questions are these: Is this common? Was this done at the factory to fill
out the corners? Should I remove this stuff wholesale?Should I just take it
off where it is cracked and fill it back up with Bondo then paint over?
 I've never done any body work before so your help is deeply appreciated.

TIA,

Chris
'76 Westfalia
