Subject: Re: name of light reflector?

It's called a side-marker lens/reflector (red).  They're still available in
spotty supplies and we get $17.50 a piece for them here at Bus Boys.  Got the
Bulbholders too at about $22.00 a piece for them.  Both are Genuine Hella/VW.

Note most Buses thru 76 or 77 had silver-rimmed lenses - NO LONGER AVAILABLE

Only Black Rimmed currently available.

Jim
