Subject:      Fast (2200rpm) idle

Well folks, here is the solution to my '88 Vanago with the 2200 RPM idle
that I could blip down to 1,000 RPM.

Seems that there were two things wrong.

1.) The throttle cable had fallen loose from one of the holders under the
van around the transmission area - making it 'sticky'

2.) The idle was set a tad high.

Those were fixed and Volia' a regular idle!
