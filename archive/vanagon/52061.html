Vince,

Don't use cables....they aren't as good as chains.  

Make sure that you buy really good chains.  Spend the extra money...it's a
matter of safety.  I don't have a preferred brand, but you can tell goods
one from the bad ones.  The good one look beefier and the links look
stronger.  They are usually $20.00 more than the ones &quot;on sale&quot;.

Consider snow tires, at least on the rear of your van.  I can usually get by
on just snow tires.  I use the chains when driving over Maria's Pass and I
don't do that very often.  

Studded tires are the ultimate, but I've found that you can leave your snow
tires on longer and later into spring, just in case.  Also, some states have
outlawed studded tires.

Extra weight in the rear of the van may also help, although the engine
really takes care of this.

Finally, practice placing your chains on your van in your driveway, b/c you
don't want to have to learn how when you really need em.  Its usually cold,
windy, and you're frazzled from driving in poor weather.  Easy to make
mistakes then.

Good luck,

Mark
