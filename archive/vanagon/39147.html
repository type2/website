Subject: Commentary on Vanagons

Hi Listers,

Prior to my joining this list my primary feelings towards Vanagons were 
that they were expensive and that they should be avoided.  I remember 
seeing a few Syncro Westies when they came out and thought they were 
pretty neat, but as a poor college student with an uncertain future I 
really disregarded them and kept my sights on the old Splittie Buses.

After following some of the threads on Vanagons I began to take notice of 
Vanagon prices in the local ads etc. and found that every now and then a 
&quot;mechanic's special&quot; would pop up for fairly reasonable prices.  For some 
reason there isn't an abundance of Vanagon addicts here in the Kansas 
City area.  The two '84s I procured had a minimal amount of ad response 
even after the prices were reduced drastically.

Now I am hoping for the best as I almost have my 'Brownie Bus' 84 Vanagon 
GL ready for mobility and licensing.  With its class III hitch I hope it 
will become the ideal daily driver/utility vehicle I've been searching 
for for over 20 years, and I'm saying this after owning 200+ cars--over 
1/2 of them VWs!  Don't get me wrong, my love affair with the VW air-cooled 
beasties will never die, but I'm anxious to see how the H2o Vanagon will 
hold up to my daily vehicular abuses.  8-)
