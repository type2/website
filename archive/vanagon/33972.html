&gt;One of the Bob Hoover articles suggests buying a black oil-based
&gt;enamel, and de-glossing it with gasoline.  Well, even though I'm
&gt;rebuidling my engine gas is a pain to get at... it doesn't drain
&gt;out of my tank readily (not to mention the 2-3 feet of snow on
&gt;the van...), nor is there a station in walking distance.
&gt;
&gt;So I'm wondering if basic paint thinner (mineral spirits) will
&gt;have the same effect.  Anyone know?

&gt;Thanks!

I used Krylon Semi-gloss (or is it Semi-flat) Black paint on the '72's tin
and on the black part on the engine of the '69 Impala I had.  It comes in
spray cans, goes on easy and looks almost like original.  But do not spray
Gum-out or equivalent on it as they will take the paint off.
