Subject: RE: Power Steering Fluid Choice

VW changed to the Pentosin to correct cold weather power steering complaints.  
Obviously the thinner fluid works at lower temps.  Note that the Pentosin is 
available in two viscosity's.  There is a 7.1 and an 11.5 I think.   The 
thinner stuff should be used for cold climates only.
