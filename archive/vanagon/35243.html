Subject:  Re: Bad Gas?.......or just a fact of life?

Had a similar problem several times that seemed to be &quot;vapor Lock&quot; I don't
know if that really exists, but here were the symptoms:
Loss of power on highway, sometimes down to 20 mph on slight hills, cured by
pouring a can of dry gas type stuff in the tank.  Later figured out that the
symptoms only occurred when:
Cold weather-
Had just FILLED the tank-
Got right back on the highway-
Gone 30 miles or so-

Found out that it was also cured by stopping, and taking off gas cap.

Haven't seen that problem for 2 years, but then again, the above scenario
hasn't happened for a while.

Does this make sense to you engineers?
