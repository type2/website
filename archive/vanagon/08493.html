Subject: RE: Reverse Light (and Xmas card)

&gt;Does anyone know the secret location of the (reverse light) switch on a '73
&gt;Kombi 1700?

Carl,

The original switch is located on the left hand side of the gear box...Follow
the clutch cable and you'll find the switch (or a plug occupying where it has
been) just under the bendy flexible bit of outer case before the clutch throw
out lever.....selecting reverse closes the circuit.....

I also would like to wish all a merry and safe christmas...Melbourne's heatwave
is temporarily over but it could be all on again for christmas day.  Nothing
like sitting down to a traditional christmas dinner (roast turkey etc) in temps
over 30C!  

There is also a good chance that we're going to be shipped to Palo Alto for a
year or so next July ...We look forward to meeting some of you AND checking out
those pizza places! ....Maybe we can go surfing Thom?  What's a 70's bus going
to cost us? Maybe even a Westphalia? (gonna have to be in good enough shape to
be reliable transport with little work).

Rob K.
