Subject: Syncro Vibration

Hi everyone-

I recently started having a vibration problem with my 87' Syncro.  The
vibration is very pronounced within the van but i cant hear much from
outside.  I think i have a problem with either a transmission of engine
mount.  Yesterday i jacked up the front of the transmission (slightly) and
the vibration ceased.  The two mounts appear to be in good condition but i
think thats my problem.  Anyway, how tough is it to replace these mounts in
the Syncro, and has anyone had a similiar problem??  I'm going to look into
it more today.  Bently is pretty vague concerning these mounts in the syncro.

Thanks
Mike
