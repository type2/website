&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else out there heard that westy's in the US are prone
&gt;to tipping to the left on left turns because of so much of the weight
&gt;of these things being on the left side of the van (kitchen, etc.)?
&gt;If so, does anyone have any brilliant idea about how to prevent
&gt;this potential?
