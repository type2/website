Subject:  hard shift q - update

thanks for the replies to my previous query (just got them this morning,
and will check everything out his evening).  i am posting this to add to the
previous post, in case the additional data i am providing gives more of a
clue as to what's happening.  i have determined that the van goes into
gear (the stick moves into the correct positions) as smooth as ever
without the engine running, but as soon as i start, it won't go into gear at
all (except it'll move toward, but not into, reverse with a huge GRIND).  if i
put it in gear with engine off, clutch in, it turns over but wont start.  that's
about it - its not going anywhere, so any help to pinpoint the problem
(clutch, slave cylinder?) is very much appreciated.

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
