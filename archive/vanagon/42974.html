Subject: *** VW 77: Strong petrol smell ***

Hi all

I may be dropping my engine soon and in following oher threads there
does seem to be a problem with petrol fumes getting into the cab from
a perished pipe near the petrol tank.

Could someone tell me how the job is done and which pipe I should be
looking to replace.

Many thanks
Ian
