Howdy,

	I know there has been a ton of discussion about the proper antifreeze
for vanagons, ie blue-goo, wolfsburg mai-tai, etc.  I ignored it because
both of my cars are antifreeze tee-totallers!

	But......

	I need to change the antifreeze in my SO's BMW 530i, and I was 
wondering if the VW stuff might be the ticket.  I had to add some a/f 
today, and I used the Sierra brand, phosphate free stuff.  It is a 
tealish-blue color.  Is that good enough?  What makes the VW stuff so
special, and I assume expensive - how much doe$ it co$t?

Thom

&gt; Be all that you can be at McDonald's today.
