&gt; i crazy? i thought that the '74 had only an oil screen. i know this engine
&gt; had been majorly rebuilt but would someone add an oil filter? hmmm....maybe
&gt; i misread hayes and the idiots guide. i was sure that the '74 didn't have a
&gt; filter.

My '69 also has an oil filter and uses spin on fram cartridges.  Make it 
kinda nice at oil change time.  This appears to be some after market type 
adapter that goes on the oil pump.
