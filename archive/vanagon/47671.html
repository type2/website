Subject: New Alternator?

My OXS and Alternator light are taking more effort to make go off after
starting the van.  This began after I left the van parked for ten days while
I was in Vancouver.  It's been two weeks since I have been back and the
battery has had more than enough time to recover.

I thought I might try just replacing the regulator--the parts guy at my
favorite FLAPS insists that the regulator is internal--something I know
ain't true.  However--a new lifetime guarantee alternator is only $89.  The
voltage regulator from VW is probably at least this much.

What's the advice--keep looking for an aftermarket regulator or buy the
whole thing?
