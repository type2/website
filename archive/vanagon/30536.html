Subject: Re: Grendel's condition

Dean,

I removed the brake lines, capped them off and stored them.  The long run
still in the vehicle I capped off, but I pulled the T-fitting on the
driver's-side tranny horn, gently bent the pipe to give me cleaning room.

To clean &amp; paint Grendel's belly I'll probably roll her over on her side
using a tipping fixture, but right now the rust is too bad to twist the body.
 The bottom of the vertical ribs that form the cargo bay door posts are
rotted away, as are the traverse frame members at the jacking points.  The
sills on both sides are toast.  When I acquired Grendel the door sill had
sagged until it was about an inch away from the bottoms of the doors.  I used
the foam &amp; waxed paper trick, closed the doors on the waxed paper and let the
foam expand into the rotted sill, in effect creating a new door sill out of
foam.  I've now ground that away and I'm in the process of cutting away the
rotted sections.  After I've rebuilt the base of the door posts and replaced
the traverse frame members, I'll install new sills.  The bulk of the floor
panels in the cargo bay must be replaced.  This will be the last step and
will require me to recondition a number of the traverse frame members. Once
the floor is replaced Grendel will be strong enough to tip on her side.

I've ordered the available replacement panels and will install them first,
since the rot is so bad I've no alignment guide in many cases.  I have two
other buses from which I can take trammel points, plus the early bus manual
which contains the factory trammel points.  Unfortunately, in several cases
the points used for factory trammel points have rotted away, forcing me to
use fly the new panels into place using dimensions picked off other buses.
 Once the available replacement panels are in place and I have good trammel
points, I'll locally fabricate the pieces that are missing, using the stock
trammel points for alignment.

In several cases I will not be able to exactly duplicate the factory method
of fabrication since to do so would require me to dismantle some portions of
the bus that are not damage.  In those cases I will locally fabricate the
flanges and angles that have rotted away, selecting a metal thickness so as
to return to the stock dimensions which often times are arrived at by three
or more pieces of steel spot-welded together.  Examples of this may be seen
at the lower-outer edge of the front seats and the area where the rear
sheetmetal is attached to the frame on either side of the engine compartment.
 In the latter case the problem is collision damage.  The metal is either
missing or so badly crumpled it's impossible to dismantle it properly, that
is, by drilling out the spot welds and/or using an air chisel to open the
seams.  In the former case the metal is simply gone, completely rusted away
leaving holes as much as 10 inches on a side.

There is also considerable rust in the double-walled sections associated with
the lower portion of the nose skin.

In these cases I think it will be best to locally fabricate replacements,
usually from a single sheet of steel using .065 and .093 thickness where
appropriate, rather than duplicate the original by building up those sections
from several pieces of .028 or .035 stock.

All of my repairs will be made using continuous seam welding rather than spot
welds.  This is a little trickier but will result in a stronger structure,
less prone to rust.  When the repair involves the replacement of a
double-walled structure, after the interior is treated with a phosphoric rust
barrier I'll fill the voids with foam so I won't have to worry about rust  in
the future.

I'll probably pull Grendel's front axle and steering wheel assembly but only
to make it easier to clean, and to gain access to the cockpit floor area,
which must be replaced.  Mechanically, the front axle is in good shape.

Right now I'm waiting for the replacement panels to arrive.  In the meantime
I'm cutting away the rusted portions and pulling the glass, filling the holes
with plywood trimmed to shape, varnished to protect it from the weather.
 When time permits I'll rebuild the windows, all of which are rusted so badly
the assembly screws can not be seen.

At the same time, I've taken my '65 bus off the road in order to replace the
tranny, a task I've been putting off for the past two years.  It has a bad
differential bearing and sloppy synchos.  Recently a bearing in one of the
outboard gear boxes has started  to howl at me so it was obviously time for
some heavy maintenance.  Since both the engine and tranny are out, I thought
it would be a good opportunity to scrub and repaint the bottom of the
vehicle.  I'll also rebuild the shifter rod if I can find the bushings that
go in the tunnel.  If I can't find stock parts (they're listed as 'No longer
available')  I'll make bushings out of 1/2&quot; Teflon plate.

Since you're the second person to inquire about Grendel's progress I'm going
to make this a general post.

-Bob
