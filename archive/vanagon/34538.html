Subject: next ccc's camping date


I realize I promised some of you I'd announce a date for the 
forthcoming camping trip.  Two people's schedules are still on
hold, and we're waiting to hear the outcome, which will determine
on which of the 4 dates I mentioned that the majority of participants
can attend.  It looks at this point a little more firm for
the Feb. dates, rather than the March dates, but I'll keep you
posted as soon as I know.

Since a strong showing of eager campers presented themselves from
both northern and southern CA, my plan is to look for a camping
spot sort of midway between.  I had in mind Sequoia, south of
Yosemite, but heard that they were sort of &quot;formal&quot; at this campground,
and wouldn't be likely to tolerate our antics, so I'm up for
suggestions for places.  I kind of wanted to try real winter/snow
camping, but it isn't crucial...let me know your location ideas.
