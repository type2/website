Subject: FS: End play Adjust tool

Hi folks,

I'm selling my end play adjust tool (the kind used with feeler gauges to
measure end play on the upright engines).  It's virtually new, only used it
a couple times.  I finally bought a dial indicator so I won't be needing
this tool anymore.

Only $14 (this includes shipping to anywhere in the U.S.)
