Subject: Re: Boulder Colorado

oh, if you absolutely _must_ have someone else do your job, i was 
favourably impressed by Renn-Wagen in Boulder.  they mainly do porshe 
work (check out the several old 356s there, including a rare coupe!), 
but they guy seemed knowlegeable, and several busses littered the 
parking lot.
