Subject: Re: Good machine shops that do mail orders

 
&gt;this work--I seem to recall a company named Rimco in California, but do they
&gt;do mail order? I'm perfectly content to take my chances with an align bore
&gt;from a good shop and I'm not interested in paying $330-$400 for a new case.
&gt;
&gt; 
 Greetings:
 
    I have been using Rimco's services for years and have been always
satisfied. They have no problem with UPS at all. They are one of the oldest
VW machine shops around and have a very good reputation. If you need their
address let me know. I beleive they advertise in Hot VWs.
