Subject: Fixing Coolant Leak

After doing a pressure check on my newly rebuilt 83.2 westy, I found coolant 
to be leaking around the thermostat housing.   This does not leak while I'm 
driving though.  I assume this is one of the reasons for my cooling problems.  
 The engine is under warranty and but my mechanic cannot look at it until next 
week.  Is there anything I can do fix this leak myself?  I'm not too skilled 
with these w/c engines but I do have full access to my mechanics shop.   Is 
there anything I should look for, etc.

Thanks
Bryan
