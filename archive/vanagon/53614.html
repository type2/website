&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; Does anyone know if the Vanagon ever came in 9 passenger in the USA? &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;VW brochures show this as an available option from 1980 to 1982.

&gt;This has been asked before.  I know for a fact that they went to at least
&gt;83.5 since I have one that my parents bought new back then.  I believe they
&gt;were imported at least through '85.
