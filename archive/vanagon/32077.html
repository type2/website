Subject: 84 Vanagon Mainshaft Update (?)

Hi All,

After further research it turns out my newly acquired 84 Vanagon's 
4-speed had a loose, not bent, mainshaft.  How it became loose, I'm not 
sure, but the PO had just put in a new clutch.  The looseness tore up the 
tranny's oil seal, thus creating an oil leak that left a 'spot' 
everywhere the PO went and the PO sayz he parked it after that (the 
tranny is in the passenger area right now).

Anyways I'll pose a second ?:  is it uncommon for a 84's 4-speed 
mainshaft to become loose??  Thanks in advance.

BTW, it came with a *factory* Vanagon service manual!  8-)
