&gt; &gt;Here's a question- A friend of mine has, among his collection, a 57
&gt; &gt;Westphalia, with what I would swear to be a factory installed removable
&gt; &gt;roof section. It is basically the same size as the roof of a single cab.
&gt; 
&gt; but is it in the middle of the full roof? or do you mean that the roof over
&gt; the front seats is removable?
&gt;
It's the front roof, like removing a single-cab roof. The hole end about
a foot on front of the pop-flap, which is over the passenger side cargo
doors.
