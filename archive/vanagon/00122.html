Bosch has there own string of service centrers around the US, a whole network
of independent repair shops servicing all vehicles with Bosch components. I
figure if you are not getting good fuel injection service at your VW dealer,
you should check out the local Bosch repair facility.

Has anone on the list found out what manuals/microfiche these independent
Bosch repair facilities use for Vanagon. It could be that these
manuals/microfiche have more detail on a lot of the fuel injectio n stuff
than our regular manuals.
