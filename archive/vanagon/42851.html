Subject: I'm off for a week, and my EV is pissed!



well folks, I'm off to Yurrip for a week on Univ. business (yeah...right 8) ) 
and because of my NOT taking the EV with me (never mind not taking the rest 
of the family as well), the EV has thrown a hissy fit.

Over the past few days the A/C has slowly converted itself from a cooling 
system to a venting system...the strange thing is that the compressor 
works...there's refrigerant in the system...the radiator fans kick on when 
the A/C is switched, so I think maybe the thermostat in the cabin has gone 
south...

So, I'm sending the EV to VW Summer Camp for the week! On the way to the 
airport I'll drop it off so they can muck with it (as well as put on a new 
fuel filter (after 45k miles)) while I'm gone....

And speaking of which...i'm gone from this list after 1:00 pm today...and 
back on the evening of 6/1....

Ric
