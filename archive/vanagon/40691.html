My '72 (build date 6 June 1972) had the spare tire mounted on the front when
I got it.  I have no idea if it was originally manufactured with it there or
not (probably not) but the cushion at the back is made to got from the closet
all the way over to the left side over the tire well.  The upholstry matches
the rest of the interior (except driver's and pasenger's seats) so it appears
to be original.  Maybe this was an option?
