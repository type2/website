Subject: Re: Did we lose another one?

&gt;OK, being among the poorer recipients of this list I feel OK in 
&gt;suggesting this.  There are about 300 of us right?  I say we find out who 
&gt;the poor Vanagon owner is(was) and all send him $10.  That should put him 
&gt;in at least a mid to late 80's Van.  C'mon.  I spent that much yesterday 
&gt;on doo-hickies and thing-a-ma-jigs.  Can someone find out who the van 
&gt;owner was?  
&gt;It would be such a gooooooood thing to do.

Great idea.  If someone does the work to find out who the owner is, I'll
send a check.
