Subject: RE: Better than stickers

I think I've seen a painting of a couple of vanagon listers:  you had
your foot in its cast and were drumming on an air cleaner with a pair of
pushrods, and another guy was carrying a vanagon list flag made up of
snow-covered highways on a red landscape, and 13 starry magnesium fires
against the night sky.  The third guy was blowing the old fuel out of 
the injector from a gas heater.

Very moving.

Sorry you are shedding so much blood for your hobby.  I try to concentrate
on just bloodying my knuckles.  Good conversation starter, but little
risk of bleeding on someone I shake hands with.
