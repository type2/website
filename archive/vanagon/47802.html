Billco VW on Rt. 19 North of Pittsburgh has a '93  EV with the pop-top and
the weekender style seating w 5 speed transimmission, 17,900 miles.  I asked
them and they said they want $19,900 for it (I do not think my wife would
allow a 4th VW :-(    )

&gt;&gt; Matt,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You may want to try some of the larger auction houses. It seems that the 93
&gt;&gt; EVs that were part of VWs lease program are starting to come &quot;off lease&quot;. I
&gt;&gt; was at the local VW dealer talking to the sales manager (trying to find a
&gt;&gt; hard date the Concept 1 was comming in....no I'm not trading the EV for 1)..
