&gt; Travelled home to NH for Xmas/New Year holiday in the '78 siebsitzer.  No 
&gt; matter how far I moved the lever upward to seal the fresh air flap on the
&gt; nose, cold air POURED through, brrrrrrr.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheap/mid-holiday solution:  I cut up old styrofoam meat trays to fit in front
&gt; of the flap, removed the grille and stuck 'em in.  Still there, and I'm still
&gt; warm.  6 screws, hooray.

My standard fall routine includes taking the grill off and inserting a
double layer of 6 mil black plastic between the metal and plastic grills. 
After reinstalling the outer grill, trim with a razor blade.  This usually
lasts out the winter, and by spring, has enough leaks/is breaking down
thru UV exposure to the point that I have adequate, but not overwhelming,
ventilation for spring/summer.  Next fall, do it again...  Funny this
should come up now, as I just noticed the first leaks this past weekend.
Another Vdubber I know sliced up a truck inner tube and made himself a
reusable liner.
