&gt; Quick question for anyone who can answer.
&gt; I have an 85 westy GL, that's quite lower in the rear than the front.
&gt; I would like to replace the rear coil springs, are  the springs the same
&gt; as a non westy Vanagon??

 For added traction, (something the Vanagon is in need of), If I 
 were you, I would not replace rear spring. This is a blessing, 
 most Vanagon I have seen need front spring and have real bad 
 traction in the snow!
