&gt; I realize that this is *way* off topic, but I never understood why the
&gt; Canadian government was so opposed to recognizing Quebec as having a unique
&gt; culture.  It seemed like a reasonable thing to do.
&gt; 
It's not the culture thing which is a problem, it's how they would 
like to pick and choose which parts of being 'Canadian' they'd like 
to keep. ie: accept all the nice benefits while skirting the costs and 
responsibilites which are paid by the rest of the provinces.
We've been paying for years now for bilingual packaging in ALL of 
Canada by law, yet many places in Quebec have signs only in French. 
This last part is fine with me, after all, half of Vancouver has 
signs with no English whatsoever. But those separate cultures are not 
demanding that the whole country pay for bi-lingual packaging.
I like the diversity of cultures in Canada, until one culture starts 
thinking they are *more* unique than another. 'More unique' does not 
exist. Too many double standards for me. I pay far too much tax to 
just ignore those groups taking advantage of the system and getting 
away with it.
