Subject: 1996 International Vanagon Meet... 1/1/96 Brussels


Yep, while on a bit of a layover between flights, I'm going to 
be hanging around the Brussels airport from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm..
Brian VanBeek is meeting me (and my family) at the airport...if
there's anyone else out there in the neighborhood...stop by, or
hell, fly over!! :)

E-mail for details.

Ric
