&gt; I can honestly say my engine (1776cc) has run without any major

&gt; Of course I should qualify myself and say that the engine was built
&gt; only 1000 miles before I bought it!  So I dunno if that counts.

Hey, that counts!  They're your miles, cherish them!  Actually, in my
opinion that's not bad at all for a bus engine.  I occaisionally got that
many out of my stock 15 and 1600s, but only if I was nice to them and
didn't drive them over 60 or race Datsun pickups (In my advanced years of
43, I tend to do less of that, and concentrate on getting to and from A and
B alive and making the ride last).  Buses, to be sure, are best owned and
operated by people who like to tinker on the weekends - I NEVER kept a
record of oil changes or tuneups, I just did them when it didn't &quot;feel&quot; or
&quot;sound&quot; quite perfect, or the oil looked a shade too dark.  Never took more
than a half hour to do either or both jobs at the same time...

&gt; On the other end of the spectrum, I still can't cure my bus brakes.
&gt; I've given up and just drive with the fear of God, hoping that I
&gt; don't ever get called upon for a super fast stop.

As Bugatti was once quoted when someone complained about the brakes on his
cars: &quot;We build them to go, not to stop.&quot;
