Received a letter from VWoA yesterday. In the letter VWoA refuses to
compensate nothing to my westy at 61k miles for its head gasket problem.
The only reason is the age of the westy regardless it had the problem in
1991 at 46k miles. Actually it had the problem much earlier at less than
30kmiles. My buddy just did not what the hell the problem was. 

I am going to go for the BBB Autoline route to see how it goes.

Oh, BTW I mentioned that I visited a VW showroom a while ago. Ha, it's
a mistake. Will never near any VW showroom ever again. Ever heard what
customer satisfaction is? VWoA sure never know what it is.
