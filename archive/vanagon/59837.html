Ron asked:
&gt;What *is* a GIFI outlet?


Ground Fault Interuption Circuit (GIFC) Opps, looks like I did the accronym
wrong.

It is the outlet you see in new home construction in bathrooms and kitchens
with the
red and black buttons. It is supposed to turn off the outlet if anything
pluged into it
shorts out before you get electrocuted. (Like if you dropped your hairdryer
in the bathtub full of water)
