Yes!   An '87 Vanagon GL full camper, 4-spd, PS, A/C, blue, 115k, rebuilt
motor &quot;6 mos. ago,&quot; very clean, $8500, a joy to drive.  Needs new roof
&quot;gasket&quot; (?) or seal, but otherwise seems in very good shape.  Had hoped for
a lower price, and for AT, but decided manual would be fine.  The price
isn't as terrific as some I've heard of, but better than many I saw, right
around wholesale Blue Book.  Got it from a local VW dealer, and hope all is
as represented.  Made me a little nervous that they didn't have any
paperwork on the &quot;new motor,&quot; but....

My thanks to all who responded thoughtfully to the doubts I posted a couple
of days ago---as you can see, I was much encouraged.  It feels like I've
been on this list for months, and it isn't even a week!  What really
inspired confidence was the obvious depth and breadth of this list as a
resource, along with the FAQ, archives, etc.

On the road again!
