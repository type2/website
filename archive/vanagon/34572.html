Subject: Sagging suspension ??

	Went to look at another '71 bus over the weekend  -  I didn't look  
very long. Fortunately it was raining so could trace all of the leaks 
inside coming from the  rusty  areas around the windshield seal. 
Since repairing that area  is one  bodyworking project I  do not 
want to get involved in, I passed. 

	In  my initial  walk-around,  I noticed the rear seemed to be  
sitting lower than  other buses I've seen. Does anyone know what the 
clearance between the top of the tire and the top of the wheel  
well should be (front and rear)  in '71 era buses? Is rebuilding the 
suspension  a major undertaking?

	BTW, is there a Bus-buying FAQ? (If not, am I volunteering to start 
one? Hmmm...well....maybe.. I've never done a FAQ before but then 
most of the stuff I can do I'd never done before.....)
