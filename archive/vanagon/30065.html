Subject: WTB: Camper for Xmas present (for myself!)

Am presently searching high and low for a camper.  If you have (or know of)
anything which fits the following description, please email me:

1985-1990
Westfalia or not
Wolfsburg or not
Pop-top/weekender, etc.
stove
sink, etc.
Gas or diesel
fair condition (does not need to be immaculate)
Must be mechanically flawless
Prefer low miles
Any color except Mary Kay Pink
Preferably east coast, within 1000 mi. of North Carolina

I have been combing the United States for something along these lines for a
reasonable price, and many thanks to the people on this list who have helped
me (John Anderson in WV and Jim Ellis in AZ in particular).  But I thought
I'd post something . . . .
