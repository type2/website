Subject: Re: Something off reec.autos.vw


Here's my $.02 on the &quot;list crossover&quot; discussion that has just 
started over here. There is NO need for crossover, IMHO. Each
group, r.a.vw, Vintag, and Vanagon have evolved because of the
unique &quot;community&quot; they serve.

R.A.VW about 2 years ago was the closest thing to a &quot;universal&quot;
VW list. Then the watercooled types wanted to split off and
caused such a stink about it that the aircooled types kind of
said &quot;up yours&quot; and ended up on Vintag.

All thats left on R.A.VW is a mix of 90% watercooled and 10%
air (as opposed to about a 50/50 mix 2 years ago). I still
read r.a.vw for the odd air-cooled piece and to see if there
is anything that would be relavant to my 200k mile 86 GTI.

Its been said that the materials and discussions on Vintag as
well as Vanagon are probably better and more informative than
10 years worth of DBHVW and VW T&amp;A...ooops Trends. I agree
with that. 

I also see that there is a certain &quot;personality&quot; to each list (
maybe &quot;support-group mentality would be more like it  ;-)   )
that I think would dissapear by crossing the groups again..
can you imagine watercooled types putting up with:

	1. Friday Haiku
	2. My rantings about my EV and '56 bug
	3. Steve Johnson being himself
	4. Martha threatening to pose in a flannel shirt...

Can you imagine how the State of Alabama would go bankrupt if
Joel had to keep track of air/watercooled/etc on his wonderfoul
lists?

Eventhough time has proven him wrong, I sort of think of that
old Billy Joel song...&quot;I love you (the lists) just the way
you are&quot;. (As an aside, that song (which sucked IMHO from the
beginning) just doesn't have the same magic now that BJ dumped
his first wife for Christie Brinkley and then after Christie
dumped BJ...so much for philosophizin' on an empty coffee
tank.

I warned you folks....I BAAAAAaaaaAAAAck....
