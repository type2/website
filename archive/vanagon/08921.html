&gt;I need help in finding a deal on a transmission.

i don't know how far away this is, but this guy helped me with a tranny
part a while back. he rebuilds stuff for buses (and beetles):

Weddle Engineering           Bus/Vanagon Transmissions rebuilt, parts,
P. O. Box 15466              Lock-Right limited slip differential kit
Long Beach,  CA  90815       for Bus/Vanagon transmissions ($300+labor)
(310) 598-2731

&gt;What should a rebuilt tranny cost outright? My trade-in
&gt;might not be rebuildable. On the other hand, a good used
&gt;tranny mught be better, since the rebuilt one that I bought
&gt;last time only lasted 7 years.

also get a copy of HOT VWs and VW TRENDS and check the ads in there. lots
of folks advertise rebuilt transmissions for buses. good luck.
