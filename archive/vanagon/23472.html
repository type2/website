Subject:      winches

why do you people go on and on and on about some spanish ventriloquist
who was too cheap to buy a real puppet and drew faces on his fist with
lipstick??? sheesh!!! boy, is that old ... and the only place he ever
showed up was on the Ed Sullivan Show! (and you could see his lips move,
anyway ... Sen'or Winches, that is. you could NEVER see Ed Sullivan's lips
move!).

:)

all you people who were born after 1960 won't understand a word of that!! :)
