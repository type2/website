Subject: DC area split window bus--free!

I saw a badly rusted but totally cool split window bus in the woods next to
my sister's house. The owner seemed to say the van was free for the taking
for anyone who wanted it. 

It is near the beltway and Route 66. I think they plan to convert these
woods to a housing development in the next year, so if nobody claims the
vehicle I bet it's headed to the crusher or junk yard. Lots of parts on it.
Not a westy. Not 21 window.

My sister's home phone number is 703-698-9265. Call her in the evening or
weekends to get information but don't leave a message on her machine and
expect her to call you back.
