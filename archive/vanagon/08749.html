&gt;1.  An intermittent short in the circuit that includes the dash gauge

&gt;that a short is a likely candidate.  Sometimes it runs fine for a while
&gt;and then rapidly moves to hot.  Sometimes it's accurate.

it could still be the gauge sender, located on the thermostat. or the
electrical connection to it. especially if, say, the water pump has leaked
onto it, and fouled the connector. try what Baxter said and clean it first.

&gt;2. A sticking thermostat.  Once in a while the engine actually is hot.
&gt;So, I've concluded I need to change the thermostat.
&gt;So, where is it?

could be. Gerry just went through this with his 84 model.
the thermostat on your 85 is at the REAR of the engine (meaning bumper-side
rear end of the car), at the more-or-less upper left side. there should be
a big 'bump' looking thing, with three hoses coming/going into it. a little
to the left of the water pump (which has a pulley and fan belt on it).
there will be a big hose coming from the left, a big hose going out of the
bottom (which is how you get to the thermostat) and a little hose going out
to the right side cylinder head). there will be two electrical connectors
into the housing as well. it's big as life, can't miss it. ;)

do try the cheap stuff first: cleaning all the electrical contacts ... it's
a messy job to change it out, what with the coolant and all. and if you do
need to change either the sender or the thermostat, let the car cool for a
long while first ... that coolant stays hot for at least 4 hours and isn't
very comfortable on your skin when it's hot. :)
good luck.
