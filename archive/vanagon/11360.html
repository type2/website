Subject: Clicking in Wheels - Ideas of why?
Date: Wed, 8 Feb 1995 15:38:00 -0800 (PST)

So Jack Agnew says:
&gt; OK, so now I got another wierd thing going on with my '86 Westy.
&gt; It is a heavy clicking that seems to be comming from the wheel(s) that is 
&gt; rotational (it speeds up when I do) and then goes away when there appears 
&gt; to be enough rotational speed to keep whatever it is in place. This is 
&gt; not a heavy metal sound, but neither does it sound &quot;tinny&quot;.
&gt;  
&gt; An enterprising allignment shop wants me to believe that it is wheel 
&gt; bearings that need packing, and it may be, but it sure sounds more lke 
&gt; something that is loose at one end and swings when I slow down.
&gt; 
&gt; Who has run into this before and knows what I am hearing - more 
&gt; importantly, how to cure it and is it  important to track down and fix 
&gt; right now?

It's the bearings.  You've just described the classic sound.
