Subject: Vanagon T-Shirts For Sale

A friend of mine has designed and produces T-shirts for Vanagon 
&quot;Junkies&quot;.  These T-shirts were a big hit with Vanagon owners at
Buses By The Arch over Labor Day.  They have been designed
from genuine VW line-art.  One style pictures a passenger and the
other pictures a Westy with top popped.  Both graphics illustrate
water-cooled  Vanagon with alloy wheels.  Both T-shirts also have
&quot;Vanagon&quot; across the bottom in matching font to the Vanagon rear
hatch nameplate. High quality 100% cotton white T-shirts were used
and the silk-screening is in blue.

If you are interested send a $15.00 money order for L and XL
or $16.00 for XXL to:
     Fred's Sign Shop
     Randolph Road
     Detroit Lakes, MN  56501
     218-847-3973

This is the &quot;Fred from Minnesota&quot; that has contributed numerous articles to
the LIMBOTransporter over te last several years.
