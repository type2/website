Subject:      How do the heat controls work on an 85 GL?

I've recently acquired a 1985 vanagon GL after owning a variety of air
cooled busses over the years. The van was bought barely running, with
massive cooling system problems. Now that I've almost got the cooling
system right, and have the engine running just fine, I'd like to know how
the heater controls work. Specifically, what do the four levers do exactly?
The top one controls the setting of the heater valve, but other than that,
the rest seem to have unpredictable results. More to the point, is it
possible to set the system to recirculate (i.e. shut off outside air
entirely) or not? I've seen some references in the archives to stuffing
foam rubber in the vent, which seems a bit kludgy, but I suppose I could do
that.
