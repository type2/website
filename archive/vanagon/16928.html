Subject: Bay front seats

&gt; Fixed metal roof, seats eight (only one-piece-windshield I've ever seen
&gt; that has an all-the-way-across front seat that seats three. All others
&gt; have been step-thru), I live in San Diego, and when some idiot is tailgating

&gt; 
Actually, a local VW mechanic has a Vanagon '82 or '83 with the
full across front seat, blew my mind as I had seen bay Buses but
never a Vanagon with this option, maybe it came down from Canada
or something.
