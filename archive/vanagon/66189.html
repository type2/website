Subject:      Re: Curtains for 90 Vanagon?

On Wed, 1 Oct 1997 07:56:17 -0400 you said:
&gt;Now I'm seeking curtains.  The van has snaps for the mindbogglingly
&gt;expensive curtains ($200 EACH!) offered by VW.  I have a request in to
&gt;Z-Products out in Oregon for info on their curtains-and-hardware kit, which
&gt;is $169.  Any words of wisdom on the Z-Prods curtains?  Or (it could happen

well, if (like me) you don't particularly care to sew a lot, they are pretty
good. after you get them, however, you'll be pissed at how &quot;simple&quot; it would
have been. :(  and i recommend NOT getting the light-colored ones. i had
thought that it would reflect the heat to the outside, but instead, the
lighter material allows light to come in... so what i had to do is make up
some additional &quot;towels&quot; of dark thick material and lay over the curtains
(to block the light).

am i satisfied with them?? yeah. could i have done better myself?? well ...
NOW that i know what to do, sure. ;)  would i?? probably not. :)

but! you might want to check with some local RV sellers or if you have them,
some yacht/big-boat places. they might have something that would work and
be cheaper.

but the Z-Prods stuff is easily installed, and adequate. the only problem
i ran into was on the rear hatch ... i had to make a small modification to
the curtain rod to get it to go into the already-in-place screw holds for
the defroster groundstrap screws.
