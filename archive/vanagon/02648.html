&gt; First, I couldn't rebuild mine for $35 apiece because it's the $hafts that
&gt; need to be rebuilt, and that can't be done with a kit, but only by a
&gt; carb machine shop (so I'm told).  

It was $35 for both, and for that price, it couldn't hurt.
The throttle plate assembly that you are referring to is separate from
the carb, and can be taken in to a machine shop to have a bushing
replaced rather cheaply.  I think my local shop was gonna do mine for
$40 each.  Instead, I hit the junkyards and found some real good ones for
a couple of dollars each.  I think I even got a couple extra ones, which
I might be persuaded to part with, since you *do* have a Safare, and all :)

&gt; 					Second, I hadn't thought about the
&gt; ramifications of replacing my twin Solexes with that tempting two-barrel
&gt; single setup.  Since I am also in CA and have to make a decision as to
&gt; what route to take (or else continue fouling plugs and getting 12 mpg),
&gt; I'd appreciate it if someone can let me know how difficult it might
&gt; be to get a replacement setup to pass the inspection.  I'd love the idea
&gt; of actually staying with traffic in the merging lane, but is it a
&gt; realistic possiblity?

I merged with traffic once, going down the Grapevine!  *stupid grin*
I think it would be easier to swap the original carbs and intake on every
two years than to try and get an aftermarket setup to pass inspection.  If
I ever find some cheap aftermarket carbs (or carb) that's what ah'll do.
