Dear to my heart.  The system was a Fuel Cell lined box that was fitted to 
the roof rack, yep it was a mutha to fill but gravity fed to fill the real
tank when it ran dry.  Simple, worked for the desert 440Magnum powered
Dodge 4WD SWB van that I saw.  I bet the tank didn't know what kind of van
it sat on either.  Of course a couple of wedge plastic fuel containers
would do the trick too.
