&lt;&lt;       In the meantime can someone tell me the best way to fix this and
 properly.  Helicoil? larger tap size and fresh bolt? weld it up and
 retap/reseat? I don't dare have this shake out 15 miles into the woods, so
 its got to be solid.  Can't have it blow out on the highway at 4K rpm
 either!.  Suggestions folks?  Thanks.  Will post the dealer discussion and
 results tomorrow, meanwhile keep those letters coming.

I would find a self tapping oversize plug.  These cut less material than any
other option and they work well.  The next option would be a heli-coil.
