Subject: My new purchase...'82 diesel Westfalia

     I'm getting excited about this thing...Just can't wait to get it!
     
     My better half has made me promise not to work on it until I finish 
     the taxes, though. This could take a little while. I still need to 
     file my returns for '93 and '94! :) Oh well...time to burn the 
     midnight oil!
     
     A little background on my purchase. I am located in Washington, DC and 
     the Van is in Orlando, Fla. The big question is how yo get it here. 
     Last night, Tom Forhan came up with a great idea- Put it on the Amtrak 
     Auto-train! So I called Amtrak last night, and it will cost $170 for 
     the Van to take the train, and another $70 for me. Add about $85 
     airfare for me to get to Orlando...total cost should be just over 
     $300! Sounds like the way to go!
     
     On another note, my apologoies to anyone trying to mail me. Looks like 
     I can mail out, but can not recieve. Looks like we patterned our 
     system just like the one Tom F. is using! :)
     
     So, until my &quot;normal&quot; mail comes back to life, please feel free to 
     e-mail me at 72172.3371_at_compuserve_dot_com
     
     Thanks!
