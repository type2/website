&gt;&gt;Regarding those Hella rear fog lamps, I second your opinion;
&gt;&gt;they really can be a lifesaver and everyone driving in the
&gt;&gt;CA Central Valley ought to have 'em.  (and not hooked up as
&gt;&gt;a stop light, either!)
&gt;&gt;On a related note, the T4 has those two cutouts on the 
&gt;back bumper that are meant to house the rear fog lamp.  Ric,
&gt;&gt;have you looked into these?  I think they'd *really* look 
&gt;&gt;way-rad back there!

You can have mine.  I *hate* the damned things.

&gt;Rear fog lights are compulsory in Europe and they are 
&gt;definitely a good thing in dense fog but they are also 
&gt;the cause of my biggest gripe about driving. Too many 
&gt;people drive with them on in the slightest bit of mist 
&gt;when you can still see for miles or, even worse, in the 
&gt;rain when they are reflected off the road  and every 
&gt;drop of rain on your windscreen. It's worse than being 
&gt;dazzled by oncoming headlights because the driver is 
&gt;usually too stupid to realise they're blinding anyone 
&gt;behind them.

Too true, Andy.

I travelled home from Limerick last night behind a moron in a 
BMW 5-series.  This dim-wit was too completely thick to realise 
that I was flashing my lovely Hella H4 (!) spots at him because 
I couldn't see a damn sodding thing ahead of me.  The moron had 
his TWIN foglights switched on.  The last fog here was over a 
week ago.  I couldn't go backwards as the traffic was chronic 
and I couldn't overtake 'coz the on-coming traffic was in the 
way.

20 sodding miles behind a complete ass-wipe.  Gawd, was I 
MAD!!!

And I couldn't leave my Hellas on full as I'd irradiate the bus 
in front of the Bee Emm.  I *did* think of ramming him.  :]
