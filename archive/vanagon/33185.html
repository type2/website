Subject: Hi, Ric Golen here......

I found access to the net, and thought I would drop you folks a line.
Things are going well here in Grenoble. Tomorrow we leave for Munich and
Stuttgart (Porsche factory tour).


There are lots of T4s here....Transporters, campers, Caravelles, and
MVs. I managed to find a VW dealer and bought a rear fog light for my MV.
Unfortunately the French T4 accessory catalogue is rather sparce, so I
will try to find one in Germany.

I was not able to meet Brian VanBeek  on my zay over as planned due to a
change in flights, but we will meet on the 26th on my way home.

So, hello to all.....I've been having &quot;net withdrawal&quot;!


Posting soon......


Ric
