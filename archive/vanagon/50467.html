Subject: grease points

Howdy, Could someone point me to the page(s) in the Bentley which illustrate
the lube points for a late model vanagon. I have searched both the Bentley
and archives with no success. I also spent a bit of time searching under the
van and didn't recognize any grease points.

Thanks, Patrick
