Subject: Oil cooler

Hiya All,

Last time I was at the farm to check up on the resting 
beast I noticed a small pool of oil forming on the 
ground on the drivers side of the engine near the front
(front is front).  This pool only forms with the engine
running.  The suspect:  Blown oil cooler seal.
Now, how much would a new oil cooler run me?  Gasket set?
I presume that the engine must be removed in order to 
perform this service.  Correct?  ('74 II)  Btw, I get
the impression that the engine has to come out for any
and every kind of service.  I'm surprised that we don't
have to drop it when we change the oil...  Sigh...  I'm
also wondering if dropping the engine can be done by one
guy (no gender specificity).  --Ralf (gutteral 'R')
