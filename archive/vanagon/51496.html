&gt;I had my heads done on my blue whale and now the idling is low.  
&gt;Pickup   
&gt;is also real crappy.  The idling used to hang around 1500-1750 and now 
&gt;  
&gt;its at 500-750.  When I step on the gas, it seems to take its time   
&gt;accelerating but once it starts it picks up fairly quickly.
&gt;
&gt;What do I start looking for?
