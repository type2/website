	Why else would we put up with them?
	On my way back from Gulf Shores, AL (near Mexican beelte land) I pulled
over immediately upon seeing the dreaded flashing red coolant light.
Pretty steady coolant drip from the area of the plastic distribution unit
in from of the right side of the engine. No leaks from head gaskets, thank
the Lord. 
	Had it flat bed towed to a Baldwin County VW mechanic. He has an 85
Vanagon, so he does know the beasts. Says he'll get to it Monday. Hope
it's just a loose hose or perhaps a cracked distribution unit. 
	Will pass on the diagnosis and fix when I know.
