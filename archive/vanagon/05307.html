&gt; &gt; No, I meant the vent holes in the battery compartment. they vent to the
&gt; &gt; outside of the van thereby letting cold air in..... -- 
&gt; 
&gt; Same answer.  Those gases have to go somewhere.  If you seal the vents to the outside
&gt; then they'll wind up in the passenger compartment.  I don't know about you but I
&gt; prefer oxygen over hydrogen when it comes time to breathe ;).
&gt; 
&gt; I can't tell from your original post why you think sealing the vent holes will do anything
&gt; for the battery.  The battery'll be the same temperature as the outside air after sitting 
&gt; overnight anyway.

Good point, but it might make a difference while we are moving and given a
choice I would prefer not having cold air coming in from somwhere. In
retrospect though you are right, it would be dangerous (how did bugs get
around this problem with the batt under the rear seat?) DC
