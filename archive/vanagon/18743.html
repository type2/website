I'm sure getting interesting responses on this.  San Jose is quite a bit 
out of the way.  If I could find a decent 'pick-n-pull' type of junkyard 
here I'd hit it.  So many lawyers around here (Northern VA just outside 
of Washington DC) the junkyards I've talked to either haven't had a bus 
or were 'you ask for a piece and get reamed on the cost'.  Most won't 
even let you walk around the yard.

Ready for the 'best part'?  The idea was my wife's!

If I can do this do this the way I want, I'll have the front doors 
shortened but still on their hinges to give access to the lower part of 
the nose for hidden away storage.
