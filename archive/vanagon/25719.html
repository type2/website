Subject: BUS VALUES

Things are beginning to look up.  I have two buses to look at this weekend!  
And, I have put together a little checklist of things to inspect (I finally 
got Muir's book - very good!).  I have a column for adding or subtracting 
value based on the condition of the particular item, etc, etc, etc..  All of 
this is just great BUT I don't have a base to start from.  Paul Weis was 
kind enough to give me the following average retail prices:

'79   $1600
'78   $1475
'77   $1250
'76   $1050

I need a more complete list (say '70 - '79).  I will shoot for a late '70's, 
but would not pass up a good deal on an earlier model.  I am so damn 
frustrated 'cause I've looked and called everywhere for a current source of 
&quot;bluebook values&quot;.  Many of you have given me suggestions on where to call 
or write, but these will end up taking 4-6 weeks IF they even have them in 
stock.  If you could help me fill in the &quot;average retail&quot; prices, I would be 
forever in your debt.  You all have continued to be such a big help in my 
bus search.  Thanks!!!!!
