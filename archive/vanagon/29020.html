Subject: RE: Water Pump (Coolant) Replacement


&gt;I hope that I'm not just wasting bandwidth, because I don't remember the
&gt;brand of the FLAPS replacement that I used on my '84.  However, the
&gt;original VW one lasted 2,000 miles, the VW replacement about 10,000 miles
&gt;and the FLAPS generic about 70,000 miles so far.


Volkswagen does it... again!    :^)
