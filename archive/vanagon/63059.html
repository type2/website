Subject: Oil plug stripped, fix needed

I didn't do it!!!

        Imagin my surprise when I went under my &quot;new&quot; 84 Westfalia to
change
the oil and found a one inch bolt sticking out of the oil plug area.  a
wing
nut device ther was holding a rubber stopper in place.  This thing holds
the
life blood of the engine in.  I wiggled it and it fel off in my hand!
My
oil pan was already there but what if this had happened on the road!!!
        I replaced the rubber stopper and it seems to be holding.  I
ordered
a new bolt from the dealer but I suspect that the inner threads may be
stripped.  I'll try a new bolt but then what?  I have a good shadetree
mechanic near buy but what is the best fix for this?  Help.

Your local auto parts store should have some self tapping oversized oil
pan plugs that will fit.  Should be less than $5.
