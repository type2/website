 Subject: FS: 1979 Westy, Great Condition, NJ

  Well, after the SO tried to live with the Westy for a weekend, her
  suggestion is: sell it.  Wanting to keep peace in the family...here
  'tis:
  1979 Westphalia Campmobile, 98,300 on the clock.  Recent full tune up
  (points, plugs, cap, filters), oil change, new rubber, steering damper,
  engine seals, battery, tail pipe.  Passed the retentive NJ state
  inspection.  Spare in better shape than most people's road tires...
  Original paint in excellent (not show quality, but close...) condition,
  bumpers straight + fresh paint on the bumpers and pop-top.  Rims clean
  and straight.  Original chrome hub caps in good condition.  NO RUST (car
  spent most of its life in No. FLA).
  Interior in 8+ shape; no rips, tears, etc. of the upholerstry.  Having
  it cleaned this week...just some dirt (no stains) on the front seat
  covers...original carpets in great condition.  Dash shined up nicely, no
  cracks in the vinyl.
  All cabinets in place, and in good condition; water pump works, sink is
  clean, and icebox in good condition (sorry, no refrig..).
  Poptop is clean, and canvas is in good condition.  Beds work (hey, we
  have tried them out...)  and the foam is in good shape.
  This camper is in excellent shape, and ready for a boatload of fun.
  While I thought it was a good idea, after looking at the 6 cars for 3
  drivers in front of the house, (including a motorcycle...) we sheepishly
  thought it might be better to get back to the basics; I can still drive
  my GTi to work...no hidden agenda here.
  After searching the area for a year or more to find one of these, I can
  confidently say that you will have to search long and hard to find one
  in as good a condition.  It is complete, and ready to drive off.
  $4500. is not too much, I think (and is what I paid...before the elbow
  grease and tuneup/oilchange/rubber/etc).  Interested?   Call...or email
  below, photos will be up tomorrow on the website listed in my sig.
  Don't really want to sell, but will for the right offer to a good home
  to keep peace in the family.
