Hi Volks,

Yesterday was not a good day. First my 75 bus failed to pass the annual
inspection because of leaks in the exhaust. Fine. But then, a few highway
miles later, a hub cap (from the one wheel they took off to check the
brakes) fell off and with it one of those shiny aluminum beauty rings my
wife just offered me a couple of weeks ago. &lt;sob!&gt;

Those are $49.95 per set of 4 at Rocky Mountain Motor Works. Called RMMW
to see if they sell those pricey rings individually and, I'm sorry to say,
they don't. After all the raving for RMMW on this list, I expected them to
be a tad more helpful than that. Anyway, would anyone on this list have
one for sale? Oh, and maybe a hub cap, too? (I have a spare, but it's a bit
scratched.)

Thanks--

Sami, dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu
