Well I am currently considering painting my 85 Black and replace the gray   
stripe with a gold one.  Perhaps even have my artist friend in Brooklyn   
do a design on my back door.  I have a blue interior also, and I think   
black, gold with tinted windows and perhaps replace the front grill with   
the four round headlight grill of those South African vans will be Nice!

I'm close to respraying the boring white '86 &quot;Turtle&quot; (Country Homes
Camper) and would love to get some input on ways to paint her. I figure a
two-tone job, with the dividing line at either the mid-wheel well line or
the under-the-window line. She's blue inside and I think the upper color
will remain white, with a blue or grey non-metallic bottom. A custom
third-color stripe is something else I'm considering.

Does anyone have reference photos or other suggestions for a snazzier
vanagon paint scheme?
