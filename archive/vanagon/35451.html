Subject: re: More on leaky head gasket (wasserboxer)


Scott- 

I've been lurking on this list for a while but just had to respond to
your plight. I have an 89 Vanagon, bought in 1990, which recently
developed the head gasket problem after about 65K miles. When I talked
to the local dealer head of the service department, he said that VWoA
would pick up most of the cost of the repair if certain criteria were
met. He asked me to bring the car in on a day when the VW rep was
visiting the dealership. Apparently I met the criteria: I had changed
the coolant roughly every two years and had only used AutoBahn (not
that that prevented me from getting the leak anyway!). They said
mileage was not a criterion up to 75K miles. So they picked up all the
cost except for oil and coolant change plus some miscellaneous
gaskets.  To be honest, I don't know if they put in new or rebuilt
heads, but they definitely replaced both heads even though only one
side was leaking.

I would advise you to find a dealer in your area who will support you
in fighting with VWoA. This should not difficult, since they will
presume they will get to bill out a $2.2K repair to VWoA.
 
When I mentioned &quot;hidden warranty&quot; to the service head honcho, he
snorted and said it wasn't hidden ever since the FTC got after them
(VW). I didn't pursue this and am not familiar with what he was
talking about, but you might check into this - maybe the Vanagon
archive has something.

The bottom line is with your case, you should get significant help
from VW.  Keep looking for a dealer who will support you.

Good luck.


&gt;As for the repair, here's what he said. The right head gasket is leaking
&gt;and the left is ok. The gasket kit is $190 per side. When the mechanic
&gt;pulls the head, he'll know if the head needs replacing due to pitting,
&gt;but he said that almost always it will need replacing ($560 for the head).
&gt;(He sounded like he's seen this before!) He very strongly recommended
&gt;replacing the left side gasket since I'd probably be back in six months
&gt;to have that one done anyway. The left side head may be ok, but he wouldn't
&gt;know until it's off. Labor for the whole job is 13 hours _at_ $52/hr. Total
&gt;cost with two gasket kits, two heads, and labor: $2200. Ouch, ouch, ouch!
&gt;
&gt;You know, the whole time I talked with him, I got the feeling he was
&gt;drawing on a significant pool of cases like this, i.e., he'd seen it
&gt;before and not just once or twice.
&gt;
&gt;So, now to write a letter to VWoA. If anyone has any advice on influencing
&gt;VWoA on this, I'd appreciate it...
