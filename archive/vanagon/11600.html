So martha rubin says:
&gt; Well, went to the store today, and damned if I forgot to get both
&gt; beer AND prunes.  Bummer.  

Prescription: Get yee to the liquor store of your choice and pick up
a bottle or can of the alcohol of your choice and go home a imbibe 
large quantities.  Email me in the morning.  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; And, in the final analysis, I suppose all of us are &quot;strange,&quot; or we
&gt; wouldn't be on vanagon.lenti, right?   :)

That's funny.  Thats exactly what Joel and Al said.  ;)

Cheers

And thanks for still being my friend.  I owe you big time....
