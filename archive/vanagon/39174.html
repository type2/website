So S-n-J says:
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any weekend trips coming up?  We're looking for a weekend 
&gt; camp trip.  I haven't seen anything from the CCC types in awhile.
&gt; 

Well.... Martha mentioned one in April and I've heard rumors that it
was going to be possibly at Red Rock State Park, but I'm not sure.
I think when Martha gets back, she'll probably get the ball rolling
on it.  Although, she'd probably like someone else to do so.  But
I just don't think I could meet her high standards. ;)

So give it a week or so....

Cheers,

Steven
