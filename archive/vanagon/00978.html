a few things that i have discovered...


	'82 diesel


	check the heater valve to the left of the glove box.
	it weeps when old, green tears collect under the
	passenger side carpet and underlay. its a cheap
	fix - $14 can. for new valve.

	adjust the heater control cables as per instructions
	in the bently manual. access gained by removing
	instrument cluster.

	be careful when tryig to remove side window defrost
	vents - the plastic gets very brittle with age/sun.

	its not that difficult to remove the entire dash -
	afternoon job. now you can get at evrything, fix
	all loose hoses and retrieve coins, pens, trolls,
	that have fallen into the works.

	taking out the air to rear distribution box from
	between the front seats is easier if you remove
	the passenger side seat belt &quot;latch&quot;. armour-all
	sure makes it look great, but slippy as all hell.

	i cut up a furnace filter and installed behind
	air intake grill (rec.auto.vw tip). it hasn't
	cut down the air flow noticably, but it is tough
	to quantify the dust removing effect. cheap, though.

i have driven a diesel with the aux heater. boy it sure
heats up the van nicely. i also noticed in the bently
manual an optional heater with a timer so that the van would
be warm for you in the morning - sounds tempting but i can
imagine nightmarish malfunctions.
