** Sears has Everything (except brains and scrupples) **

Jay discovered that Sears is a confused pup!
He wondered if he got a free radiator from Sears for his '77 Vanagon.

VanBondo muses:
It is just as likely that they'd charge you for one whether you needed it or
not. (Years ago!!!!!)I nearly punched the sales schmuck at Sears when he
started to charge me for a 4 wheel alignment when I took my 74 Ford Pinto in
for a front end alignment. I had to remind him that the rear wheels simply
went around and around. His manager quickly interveined and showed his
associate his mistake. &quot;Musta used the wrong book!&quot;
Yeah right! I'll show ya the wrong book!
I later noticed that Sears was involved in class action litagation over this
exact sales &quot;technique.&quot;
