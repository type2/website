Subject: leaks: heads/cyls

Hi All,

The cold weather leaks are being reported more often.  Cold weather
contracts the aluminium waterjackets (but that effect doesn't change over
time) so it's the aging rubber of the head gaskets, (and the cold) that
makes for winter leaks.  the old/stiffened head gasket can no longer 'fill'
the gap as the barrels contract.  I get a few drips at -25F or colder
overnight. Not worth worrying about.  Try a block heater, bet that solves
the drips.

Leaks from brake cyls in cold may be due to water in the fluid freezing into
'bumps' which lift the seals as they pass over, weeping a bit each time.
Unless they hang up or tear.  plus cold = stiff for the seal rubber too.  If
this is happening, then I'd bet rust pitting is also on the go during the
summer.  Flush every 2 years?


bye, Tim
