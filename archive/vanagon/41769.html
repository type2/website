Subject: Vanagon Shocks (KYB's)

Hello Everyone,
	I received my KYB shocks today.  I had written a while back to say
that I might have a source for KYB shocks.  Performance Suspension
Technology (PST) came through with the 2 GR-2 Struts and the 2 Gas-A-Just
Shocks for $119 total.  This company specializes in parts for muscle cars so
these shocks are a special order item.  If you decide to order these from
PST you might have to let the phone help know that yes they can special
order them,  one of the people I talked to asked if the Vanagon was a
Chevy.  If you have any problems ask to speak with the manager, Dave ext.
309, the order # 1 800 247-2288.  It takes PST three weeks to get the
shocks and another week to ship them out, so be prepared to wait.
	PST has a web page. http://www.p-s-t_dot_com/

	Usual disclaimers apply.
	Good Luck.
	johnny Stutsman
