Subject: C.V.Joint problem?

My '86 Westy (160K mi, autotrans) has a clicking in the rear axle/final
drive/transmission area when rolling slowly (less than walking speed) with
no pressure on the accelerator pedal.  A mild lurching is associated with
the noise.  No unusual noise is observed at any other speed or condition.
This began about 30K miles ago and is getting slightly worse with time.

Is this a C.V. joint problem or do I have final drive, tranny, or wheel
bearing problems?  All 4 CV joints have been disassembled (all show
significant wear but no sign of galling) and regreased but no change in the
noise.

Any help out there?
