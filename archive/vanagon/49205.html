Subject: CCC Check-in and Out Time!
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

Hi!

Check in time is noon on Friday the 20th.

Check out time is supposed to be 11a on Sunday - but we'll be the last 
campers for the season, so nobody will be checking in after us... maybe 
the Feds will be cool and NOT be counting the minutes. The Ranger 
Station at Pumice Flat isn't really a station but a residence for a 
handful of back country rangers - and it'll probably be closed for the 
season. I'll be surprised if we see any Feds at all - this forest is 
just about belly up and I don't think they will have the man power to 
send someone all the way down into the valley to see us.

Any more questions - please let me know. I was a USDA Forest Service 
Ranger Naturalist on this district for nearly a decade... until the BIG 
budget cuts - so I can help answer questions!
