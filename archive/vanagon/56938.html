Subject: Re: diesel warm start ??

My van does the same thing. Warm start is not as good as cold or hot start.
The glow plugs do come on when the engine is warm, the light does not come
on. Try waiting a few extra seconds, just like if it were cold and them
crank it. Usually takes off better then. HTH

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;	I&quot;m having problems starting the 82 Diesel Vanagon when it's the 
&gt;engine is warm (after sitting about 2 hrs). It starts fine If its hot.
&gt;I don't thing the glows are working in a warm start situation...It' never
fails to start in cold weather when the glow timer light comes on in the dash.
&gt;Some times the glow light flashes on and the glow timer clicks when its warm 
&gt;but it takes several trys to start the diesel....not good for the poor old 
&gt;starter!!!! 
&gt;						thanks for all the help
