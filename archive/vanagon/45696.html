Subject: Wiring diagram no-longer needed for 67 Rusty! [T1]
Date: Mon, 1 Jul 1996 23:46:42 -0400

Let me just start this message by saying:  Jim, you are the man!!!

The wiring for my lighting system was a total cluster-fork to say the least.
My tailights were running off of a wire that was spliced off of the dimmer
on the headlight switch, my 4-way flasher didn't work, one headlight was
out, etc.

Well, all that is history now thanks to Jim's wiring diagram, 4 Red Dogs,
one test-lamp and a bunch of solderless connectors!

Now all I need is a new gas gauge (ever tried using a 6V gauge?  my tank
runneth over!) some side mirrors and my engine back from the shop and I'm set!

I think I'm gonna scan some pictures I have of the Rusty and e-mail 'em to
everybody!

Bob J.

(sorry, there was a sale on Red Dog this week)
