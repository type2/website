Subject: re: Poptop Mildew

I actually just got done doing this.  It is not difficult at all (with an
exception, noted below).  It took me about 30 minutes from start to finish.
That was simply because there are so many screws on the seal.  However, it
must be noted that the seal is glued and therefore you would need to find
an appropriate glue to put the seal/canvas back (in addition to the
screws).

EXCEPTION:

I have yet to be able to remove the luggage section of the poptop because
it uses two nuts on a round-head bolt.  My lock-tite's on on a rain check
from Sears so I am waiting..... (if any one else had any luck with out said
implement I am all ears)

&gt;How hard is it to remove the canvas, then take the whole top off? I
&gt;might consider this for the summer if it's not *too* tough, then I
&gt;could scrub (or pressure wash!!) without worrying about the
&gt;interior...
&gt;
&gt;Anyone tried it?

&gt;I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
