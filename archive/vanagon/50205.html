Richard,

If you can't find anyone, let me know.  I will be in Woodbridge, VA (10
miles from DC) next week and will take a look for you.

&gt; Howdy all. As a zealous member of the Air Cooled Search and Rescue Team,
I'm in
&gt; hot pursuit of a new VW, but I need some help this time. I'm in NC, and
the
&gt; vehicle is in Bowie, Maryland, which is right outside Washington DC. I
spoke
&gt; with the owner last night, and it sounds good, but I'd really like it if
one of
&gt; you kind volks in the area might be able to stop by today sometime and
check it
&gt; out for me. Time is important, as I don't want this one to slip away if
it's
&gt; all it's supposed to be.
&gt; Anyway, if anyone is in the area and can help me out, please e-mail me,
and
&gt; I'll give directions and all that.
&gt; Many thanks
&gt;
