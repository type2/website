Subject: Water Leak From Sink

Recently acquired 82 Vanagon L Westfalia

We filled up the water tank and turned on the tap.  I works fine, and
there's good flow, but there is some dripping into cupboard underneath the
sink - appears to be coming from one of the connections to the tap.  I
couldn't figure out how to remove the cupboard shelf to get a closer look
for the exact source of the drip.

Also,  the city water intake connection was broken.  Well, when I turn on
the tap to the sink, in addition to the dripping into the cupboard, there's
a full stream of water spewing outside through the broken city water
intake.  Since I won't be using the city water connection for now, I
thought of just plugging it up with bubble gum, but then realized that may
make the minor drip under the sink into a major one.

Any experience these symptoms, and any thoughts on a quick/temporary fix?

Many Thanks
