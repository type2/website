Subject:  starting problem clarification

Hey all,
Let me update the problem I am having with my '78 bus.  I just posted the
other note so if you haven't deleted it yet it should still be in your in-box.

I bought a new generic headlight relay from the local FLAPS and hooked
it up in place of the old relay that was in the car.  Well, that didn't change
anything.  Still doesn't start after using something electrical.

Get this, tho:  If you turn off whatever it is that is being used and wait ~5
minutes, then it will start right up!  It's almost like it has to build up voltage
or something?  Does that make any sense?  It doesn't to me but then if I
knew what I was talking about, it would be fixed by now.  

It only non-starts if you've been using something electrical.  For example,
if I go out to the store and park the car, go do my shopping, and come
back out, it will start right up no problem.  It has never failed to start like
that.  However, if I park the car temporarily in front of a building and put
on the flashers (for example) the car will not start.  Turn the key, red
lights dim and nothing else.  Wait 5 minutes, starts right up.  This is kinda
weird.

I'm now believing that it's the solenoid and I'm probably going to have to
schedule that as my weekend project.  Should I just have the solenoid
rebuilt or should I go for the rebuilt starter/solenoid as a unit?  

Thanks,
Sean
