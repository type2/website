Subject: Re: Wondering about Westfalia table heights.

I have owned both an '80 and '91 Westfalia.

In both vans, the table arrangement was identical - 2 swing arms, 2 tables:
1 small, 1 large. In the '91 model, VW shortened the door length to the rear
hanging closet so it could be opened while the table was &quot;stored&quot; over the 
side bins, next to the stove cover. 

Both swing arms are height adjustable to some degree. I found it rather simple
to weing the larger table out of its stored position over the &quot;cubbies&quot; to get
at stuff. Never thought it was a problem. 

I never used the front table - just leave it at home! Then I use that wsing arm
to boost myself up and get into the upper bunk - makes a nice step.

Only difference I ever noticed in the two models was the hanging closet door
length adjustment and the difference in the tightening screw at the bottom
of the table. Personally I thought the older one was more stable and would
last longer. The steel in the '80 seemed stronger/heavier in the table swing
arms and the roof lifting hardware. I am always afraid that I will bend the
newer stuff!

&gt; 
&gt; My '85 came with one table. The height of the table was high enough to
&gt; fit either above the two top loading drawers next to rear seat or in the
&gt; front it could be slid partially above the stove leaving rear hatches 
&gt; accessible.
&gt; 
&gt; My '90 came with two tables. One the length of the '85 and one smaller.
&gt; Also the leg height of these tables are both shorter than the '85. The
&gt; main problem I see is that the larger '90 table must be stored in a way
&gt; that covers the rear hatches. Getting into these storage areas is less
&gt; convenient than before. Also, since I never travel with 4 people I don't
&gt; even need that smaller front table.
&gt; 
&gt; My questions are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Has anybody else noticed this? Any suggestions for improving this
&gt; situation?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Where and how is that smaller table supposed to be stored for travel?
&gt; I see in the owners manual how it is set up for use but there is no
&gt; picture for where it belongs during travel..
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
