&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone out there know the details of the GATT bill and if it will
       ^^^^^^           ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^^
I would venture that even the pinheads on capitol hill who voted for us on
this trade agreement are aware of the the details.

&gt; reduce or eliminate the tariff on imported trucks?
&gt; 
&gt; I remember way back in the '70's that the US slapped a 25% tariff on trucks
&gt; to retaliate for some country (Germany?) putting a tariff on our chickens,
&gt; and that's why we don't get no steenkin' non-passenger versions of VW
&gt; buses anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; If GATT passes, might we get cheaper prices on the truck part of the
&gt; Winnebago camper????   Might we get stranger versions of the Eurovan?
&gt;  
&gt; Might VWoA pass on the savings to the purchaser???      (yeah, right.)
&gt; 
&gt; Any foreign trade experts or congresspersons or senators in this group?
&gt;

Wouldn't our safety laws be considered an &quot;unfair barrier to entry&quot; by the 
Mexican VW factories?  Just think, maybe you can buy those factory-fresh beetles 
and mexi-buses on the side!
