Subject:      gauge stuff coming together

Hey all,
I love the lists!

OK, the gauge order (oil temp and pressure) for my Vanagon is imminent.

I will be ordering the gauges from Bus Depot as Ron's prices are
outstanding.

Here's my laundry list so far:

VDO 300* F oil temp gauge, 2-1/16&quot; diameter, $23 from Ron.
VDO 80 psi oil pressure gauge, 2-1/16&quot; diameter, also $23 from Ron.
Sender for oil temp gauge, mounts in Type 4 sump plate, I believe $11.50
from Ron.
Sender for oil press. gauge, I don't remember Ron's price right off.
A couple of the wiring kits, if Ron has them.

I think that's about all I can order from Ron.  I also need the VDO
extension hose for the oil pressure sender (used with Type 4 engine).  I
have heard that Ron can't get this part but I will check with him before
ordering.

And thanks to a very generous lister, I will be getting a pre-drilled sump
plate to install the oil temp sender into.  I don't have the tools to do it
myself, and last time turned out to be a real fiasco.  I am not posting
this lister's name as I don't know if he wants to be inundated with sump
plate requests.  Suffice it to say he's a real nice guy :-)

As for mounting, thanks to Weston Croft who gave me some good ideas and
Polaroids too and also thanks to David Schwarze who described some of the
mounting goodies in his VDO catalog.  He told me of a VDO console that
mounts on a flat surface and tilts the gauges upwards.  Basically, if you
mounted this panel on a 45* angle, the gauge faces would be vertical.  This
sounds about perfect for the Vanagon dash.  I will be ordering it from VDO
unless Ron can get it, which brings me to another question.  Does anyone
know if VDO will take a small order from little old me?  I have a number
where I can get a catalog, I assume I can also order from them but I don't
know if they sell retail or just wholesale.  Anyone know?

I think that's about everything for the gauges.  I will probably order on
my next day off, whenever that will be :-) .  I'd like to get these
installed before I have to go back to school and time's getting short.

Thanks to everyone for the help and suggestions, and I'll keep you posted
on how it turns out.

Sean
