Subject: Wasserboxers with Gas Heaters?

Hi All,

I had heard/thought that the Eberspacher BA 6 heater was offered as an
option on  Vanagon Westies well into the wasserboxer era.  Can anybody out
there confirm this or give me a definitive &quot;no&quot;? 

If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, has anybody successfully transplanted one? 

TIA

-Tom
