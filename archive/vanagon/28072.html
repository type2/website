&gt;Has anyone had any experience replacing the top camper seal on  a 1971 Bus?
&gt;I just received the after market seal from Bus Boys (not a bad price either
&gt;- $69) for my Westy, and as soon as it stops raining, I plan to approach
&gt;this job in the proper Zen-like manner.  Ha!  
&gt;
&gt;(BTW, If anyone knows what the proper Zen-Like manner is, please let me know.)

As a matter of fact, I just replaced mine a couple of weeks ago.  I got it from
M.L. McCulloch, aka Pop Top Campers (ads in HVW), same price.  Installing it
was simple, but on the sides, the seal doesn't make contact with the metal roof.
The &quot;tube&quot; part of the seal seems to be about 1/2&quot;-5/8&quot; dia.  Looks like if
it were a little bigger it would do the trick.  I'd be curious how yours turns
out, and what the dia. is.
