Subject: Middle seat in Westy?


Has anybody tried to install a middle seat in a Vanagon Westy? I know 
some of them had this option (my brother's 84 in Germany does).

What I need to know is this: Are there any fasteners/holes already in 
place for the floor rails? Is this a bolt-on job or is it more difficult.

Also, does anybody have a middle seat (with rails and all) for sale for 
an early 80s vanagon (brown) or know of any junkyards that have one in 
the southwest?

TIA,

Joerg
