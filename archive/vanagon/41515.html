Subject: Type IV timing marks
Date: Tue, 7 May 1996 10:02:10 -0500 (CDT)

This weekend I had the pleasure of working on two different post '71 
buses.  The little marks on the timing bar to the left of the pulley 
were gone on both.  One of them had some marks painted on it at some 
time in the past so I used those.  The other didn't so I didn't touch 
the distributor for fear of making things worse.

Does anyone make an aftermarket piece to replace the stock one that 
has marks pressed into it?  Does anyone know where 0 degrees is in 
reference to either end of the strip?  If I get lucky enough to find 
one in a junkyard around here are the marks the same for 72-79?

Thanks, Jim
