Subject: Cleaning engine parts

Since it just snowed, it must be time to clean engine parts!

My case (aluminum type 4) was 'cold-tanked' or whatever, it's
fairly clean but there is still lots of greasy dirt inside and
out.  I was asked if I wanted some kind of blast cleaning, I
forget if they said 'glass-bead' or 'shot-peen' or what...
but I didn't know and they weren't very helpful so I said no.
Is that the ultimate right way to get the case clean, followed
by the cold-tanking to get rid of dust, etc?  This thing doesn't
look easy to clean with a brush... too many holes and crevices.
What have you folks done?  I want to get it real clean so I can
paint the case and have it stick...

I've been doing little areas with carburetor cleaner but at this
rate I'll still be cleaning the case in June...

Ahhhh, Temple's Maschine, in SLC... my fave... turns out they
gave me the wrong rod bearings too.  Well, at least they're
wrong as in 4 or 5 mm larger radius than my rods, like they're
for some other engine!  I'm glad it was so obvious!
And of course I find out about it at 8pm on Friday night before
the new years holiday.
