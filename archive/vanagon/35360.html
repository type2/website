So Mitch Hendrickson says:
&gt; 
&gt; 5. What's to know about trannies?  The fact that mine likes to pop out
&gt; of reverse makes me think I'm probably going to have to learn more
&gt; than I wanted to know :-). Does my '67 share with other years/models?
&gt; Can I adjust the linkage or something and fix it?  Any other info
&gt; you'd like to share?
&gt; 

Ah!  A question I might be able to answer.  Well, sort of.  Unless you
have the tools and experience in dealing with transmissions, it's probably
safe to assume that you need a new or rebuilt transmission.  The problem
will become worse and worse and soon you won't be able to get it to 
shift into reverse.  You'll be like Bradley was with his '66 and being
choosy about where you park.

Maybe others can impart better tranny knowledge than I.

Good Luck!
