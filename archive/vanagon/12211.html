Hi - I'm looking to buy a nice 80's vintage Westfalia for a cross country trip
this spring.  Does anybody know of any for sale in the the New England area?
I've looked at an '81 Westy with 67K miles for $5000.  I'd say it's between
good and excellent condition; it has some small surface rust spots above the
back bumper and there might be a little bit of oil leakage (from where I
couldn't tell).  Otherwise it's pretty nice :)  If I don't find anything better
within a week, I think I'm going to buy this one.  Anybody want to give me 
any feedback?   Thanks...
