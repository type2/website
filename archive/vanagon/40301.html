Subject: ev westy brochure

for all of you wanting to see what we are missing overhere... i wrote to
westfalia in germany and got them to send over the brochure of the 96 ev
westy. just got the brochure in the mail the other day,  oh what we are
missing here

some items of interest that are offered w/ the 96 ev in germany

*westfalia tent
*mosquito screens for windows and one to fit in opening of sliding door
*insulated fabric that installs on inside of pop top tent
*numerous different bike racks for back door
*westy stove that uses lpg gas (you remove the stove from the insideof the
camper, put it on the stand and attach it to the lpg gas container)
*westy water jugs (a la the early 60's westy)
*floor mats for the camping area of the bus
*numerous other items i have forgotten about :)

i don't have WESTFALIA'S address at hand but it must be in an faq
somewhere, the brochure makes for some great reading (albeit in german) i
would recommend getting a copy

michael
