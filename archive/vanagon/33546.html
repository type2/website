Subject: Re: cleaning greasy/grimy parts ...

I think that this is the chemical (NaOH-sodium hydroxide) that is used in a
hot tank.  Can anyone confirm of deny?

&gt;one sunday recently, a tv show about classic cars mentioned a way of cleaning
&gt;really grimy, oily, dirty parts (like oil pans, etc.): household drain cleaner
&gt;
&gt;yup. he put about three cups of something like Draino crystals into ten
&gt;gallons of HOT water, and then dunked the part into the toxic mess, using
&gt;a coat hanger to hold the part.
&gt;
&gt;precautions: he wore eye protection, big thick rubber gloves; and his wife
&gt;is gonna kill him cause he was doing it in the kitchen!!!
&gt;
&gt;but it did seem to work. now, the thought that occurs to me is: what will
&gt;that stuff do to ALUMINUM parts??? :(
&gt;
&gt;anyway, if you have some really grimy parts and you want to clean them without
&gt;a lot of scrubbing and such, you might want to try this ...
&gt;
&gt;besides ... if it dissolves the part, think how shiny the NEW part will be! :)
&gt;
&gt;how to get rid of the ten gallon toxic waste bucket?? pour it down the drain,
&gt;where it was destined anyway.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;the things you see on television these days! :)
