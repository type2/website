&gt;I used to work with a gal at a restuarant that said that her mom used to
&gt;take her to equestrian meets with her mini-pony in the back of the 
microbus.
                                       ^^^^^^^^^


Perhaps she could have better used the mini-van that that other,
once-almost-bankrupt car company is so proud of? Would have been far
more appropriate to handle the problems that a nervous, excited horse
could have, uh, produced.
