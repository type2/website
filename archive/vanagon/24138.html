Subject: transmission change


    Hi all,
    
        I have just returned from Vw Action where I was able to pick 
myself up a gearbox for stlg40 for the camper. Hopefully this weekend I 
will be able to change it over and finally get it back on the road. 
I've never attempted anything like this before, but I'm looking 
forward to giving it a try. Can anybody who has changed the 
transmission in a bus please pass on any hints or advice, in 
particular would you suggest removing the engine and the transmission 
together, as described in Haynes, or seperately? I thought whilst I 
was at it I may as well change the clutch at the same time, is there 
anything else that it is worth replacimg at the same time as the 
transmission? 

    Thanks in advance for any help.
    
                        Cheers
                                Jon
