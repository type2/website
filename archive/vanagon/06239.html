I've never had any problems with slippin' &amp; slidin'
(yet, anyway...) but I have had the accelerator pedal
freeze up at about -20 degrees F.  Let's just say it 
got my attention.  Muir has a number on greasing the 
cable to prevent this, and it works pretty well, I think.

Anyway, we moved two roads east over the summer, and
the road we're on now, one lane, gravel, has what's
known locally as the &quot;Thrill Hill&quot;--a steep climb up
from an iron bridge.  All the folks around here have
tales of the time they couldn't make it up said hill,
did doughnuts down &amp; just missed the bridge, etc.
so we'll see.
