Subject: Re: propane fill question

And, if you are doing this yourself -- make sure to wear heavy/lined gloves
to protect your hands. The gas that comes out can be VERY COLD and can
adversely effect your bare hands!

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Well, soon I'll get the propane tank on my '81 Westy filled.  
&gt; 
&gt; I want to make sure that I know the proper way to do it.  Here's how I
&gt; think it works, tell me if I'm right and correct me if I'm wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) make sure the on/off valve on the tank is off.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Remove the cap for the fill valve
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Remove the cap for the teeny &quot;80% valve&quot; to the right of the fill
&gt; valve.  
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Fill with propane until liquid comes out of the 80% valve.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Put the caps back on and pay the man.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, when you remove the cap for the 80% valve, does not gas come out?
&gt; I know there's a teeny bit of propane in there now (the valve installer
&gt; put some in to test for leaks).
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that's not a problem, but if it is let me know.  I want to make
&gt; sure that I know what's going on and I want to make sure that the guy
&gt; who fills it is doing it right.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Sean
