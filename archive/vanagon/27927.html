True. Sort of. Most computer power supplies will run on most kinds of
converters (sinewave-- the best, and modified sinewave-- the cheeper kind).
But power supplies in some electronic devices have very finicky components
called triacs which have been known to fry when used with anything but pure
sinewave inverters. These triacs are found mostly in laser printers and
copiers (for those of you who maintain a rolling printing or copy shop),
but are used in some other electronics, too.

Good hunting.

Enjoy,
