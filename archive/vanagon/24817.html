I'm not knowledgeable about the mechanics of VWs (or a gifted speller), but 
someone on the list told me to look under my vanagon to see if there was a 
break line rubbing against the shift rod.  If so, it would be one source of 
noise.  It turns out, the two were rubbing - and once seperated, the noise 
stopped.  Maybe you have the same thing happening?
