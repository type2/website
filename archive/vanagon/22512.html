Subject: Should I buy this bus?


I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.
I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of 
rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  The 
engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression 
on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic 
transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.
I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a 
Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is 
too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into 
a camper.
