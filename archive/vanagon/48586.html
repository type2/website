Yes and No.
Metric yes, but if used left handed will disengage locking blade.
&lt;and yes I know you were testing me&gt; Didn't think I had a legit 
answer did ya!

&gt; &gt; I was at Sears last night obtaining a compression tester for $25.
&gt; &gt; Found the special screwdriver that retains the screw, invaluable for 
&gt; &gt; the points screw.  $6    I already have one, they're great!
&gt; 
&gt; Do they have left-handed or metric versions?
