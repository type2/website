Subject: Crazy Man with Parts Stash (long)

There was an ad in the local paper last week about a sale of assorted VWs 
and a truck full of parts (new and used).  No phone number, just the sale 
date and directions.  This was 150 miles from me, but close to my Dad.  
Convinced Dad to go over after his classes on Saturday, but figured that 
most would be gone that late in the day.  Dad arrived in the rain to find 
this guy with a 1/2 dozen vehicles and an 18-ft truck full of stuff.  The 
guy was bummin' because he only had maybe 20 people respond to the ads 
placed in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Springfield, MO (he was in 
Sedalia).  Turns out that he had bought all this stuff in '88 from a VW 
repair shop that went out of business (in Wyoming...or Nebraska).  All 
the cars were rusty hulks, none running, some complete.  Oldest was a '61 
Beetle (no title, no motor, $150), newest was a '74 Super (I don't have 
the price list here, but it was no great bargain).  One Bus, a '71 Westy 
(bad motor, rough interior, some rust) for $300 which I think has sold.  
The most interesting was a '65 1500-S Notchback.  No pan to speak of, not 
running, rusty rockers, missing only an arm rest.  He wanted $1200 (!?).  
The truck was filled with about 15 motors in pieces, lots of tin, 
assorted glass, tail and head lights (oldest was '58 Ghia), maybe a pair 
of semaphores, 8 trannys, 3 gas heaters (Bus), etc.  New stuff included 
points, condensors, dist. caps, rotors, bearings, cables, hoses, 
windshields, D/P end castings, clutchs, oil &amp; fuel pumps, engine tin, 
push rods &amp; tubes, generators, brakes shoes &amp; drums, heat exchangers, and 
some Rabbit and Audi parts.  He also had a transmission jig and a fuel 
injection tester.  Says he wants $3000 for all the parts and if he 
doesn't sell in a month, he will send 'em to the crusher!  Doesn't want 
to give out his phone number (unless you are serious about buying it all) 
and doesn't want to have to dig out specific parts.  He won't drag it to 
a swap meet and appears to just want to get rid of it (for a price).  He 
says he won't crush the Notch, but will the rest.  I offered to run ads 
in the newsletter and on the Net, but he wasn't interested and didn't 
want people calling just to talk.  Anybody out there want to cough up 3 
grand to save this stuff?  I sure can't.
