Subject: engine swap

dear list,
  just getting mentally set for that engine swap from the 73 bus to the 74
and vice versa...do i need to disconnect the gearshift lever when i take out
the engine ??? i suppose for taking out the engine i'll have to lower the
rear end of the tranny somewhat, and that might bend the gearshift thingy if
i don't remove it. any opinions ??? and do i disconnect it right at the
tranny or where ???
