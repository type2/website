Subject: Re: Query about Weddle Engineering Differential Locker

&gt; I'm considering putting in a Weddle Engineering locking
&gt; differential and wondered if anyone has had any experience
&gt; with this unit.
&gt; 

  If you had such good luck with German Transaxle, why would you not buy 
a locking diff from them?

  We have used GT in the past and have been VERY happy with their 
service.  Had one problem and they Fed Ex'd the box both ways!  Thats a 
Great company.
