&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 87' Vanagon with 64Kmiles on its little 2.1l motor.  I like
&gt; to
&gt; sell the motor away in like to 3-5 months so I can rake up some cash
&gt; to
&gt; start my SUBARU 2.5l motor conversion.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jack Ck.

Jack,
Just a note that might help in your conversion plans- Kennedy does not
recommend the Suby 2.5 for the Vanagon. They feel the long stroke and
mild cam are not very compatible with the VW gearing. Their engine of
choice is the 2.2 Legacy which makes only 20 fewer horses in the later
cars, and is a better match for the Vanagon ratios.
Hope this helps.
Larry
