Excellent survey!  Thank you for all the info you've shared about tires.  I
purchased my '87 GL only recently, w/ no service records of any kind, so
have lots of questions wrt best products and strategies to keep it running
optimally for a long time.

One question re: the survey---since I understand that Westies weigh quite a
bit more than non-camper V-gons, are there any indications of differences in
tire needs that might affect the choice, e.g. between the Michelin
reinforced and the Yokohama Load range D?

Thanks again.
