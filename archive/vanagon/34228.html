Subject: RE: atlantic pond challenge


&gt;&quot;Okay, I take this as a challenge.  I say Martha 'Not to be out-done' Rubin
&gt;can put together a trip where we can actually traverse the Atlantic Pond to
&gt;the UK on pontoons!  Well Martha?  ;)&quot;

Remember the National Lampoon spoof on the VW ad that showed a
beetle floating in a pool? Their caption was, &quot;If Teddy Kennedy had
driven a Volkswagen, he'd be president by now!&quot;
