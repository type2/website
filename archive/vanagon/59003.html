Subject: Re: Syncro Tire Inflation VS the VC

&gt; From:          Paul Uusitalo &lt;puusital_at_Adobe.COM&gt;
&gt; With tire pressures set to VW spec, (take your pick from inside the door
&gt; jam, I run fronts at 40 and  backs at 48) you must be pretty darn close to
&gt; the 3mm F to R tire size difference (Tim describes below) that will cause
&gt; the Syncro's viscous coupling to begin to engage, no?
&gt; 
Has anyone tried just measuring the static radius of the tire when 
inflated this way? It would seem to me that taking an average of 3-4 
measurements on each tire, from ground to edge of rim, or centre of 
axle, would indicate how close the front/rear radii are...
