Subject: Re: Vanagon Westie interior lamp

&gt;fluorescent lamp for 120V for $9US, 
&gt;but have to pay $35 for an RV one of the same size?
&gt; . . . end of rant.

I had a cheap 12V RV one, &lt;$15, worked fine, really lit up the rear of the 
bus. Sold with last van need another.  Go find a flourescent camping lantern 
and adapt the guts onto your wall, maybe even just hang it on the clothes 
peg.   Tim Smith
