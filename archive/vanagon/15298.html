Subject: RE: Replacing Stock 82 Van mirrors w/stronger model

&gt;From: mattw_at_atl_dot_com (Matt Weatherford)

&gt; I have an '82 Vanagon w/side mirrors that cant stay put in
&gt; winds over 70 mph (i.e. 10mph headwind while going 60...) If
&gt; I tighten the springs in the mirrors, I run the risk of ripping
&gt; the peg out of the molded plastic (done this once already...)

We had the same problem with the mirrors on our '85.  What we did was
to put in stainless steel hardware.  Remove the peg and replace it with a
bolt and washer.  You will have to file/cut to remove the peg and put in
the bolt but at least you can tighten them down without any problems.
