&gt; You guys aren't by chance refering to the wash function, are you?  I know that
&gt; on later busses the hose from the windshield washer tank runs up to a valve
&gt; on the column and from there to the jets on the windshield.  If the washer
&gt; tank wasn't pressurized, then moving the lever wouldn't appear to do anything.
&gt; But I can't remember if this is the same lever as for the wipers, or a
&gt; different stalk.

It's the same lever, but you get the wash function by pulling up on the lever,
towards your face.  :)  My four-position wiper doesn't do anything in
the down position either.
