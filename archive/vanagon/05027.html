David suggests:
&gt;Windshield washer pumps are notorious for corroded connections and the 
&gt;setup for the water pump is similar...you might even find a washer
&gt;pump as a substitute. DC

A good idea. It may even save you $$. Washer pumps at, say, Autozone are
only $5 or so (at least, I think that's what I saw). But they MAY not be
powerful enough. I once tried it the other way round, replacing the
bicycle pump driven windshield washer with an electric one, using a
left-over RV water pump: it was kind of an overkill...
