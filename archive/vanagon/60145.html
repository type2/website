Subject: Convertion help wanted.

Hello all,

I am converting my 87 syncro from gasoline to turbo diesel.  Has anyone
done this and is there an easy solution to the problem of starter
clearence between the fuel tank and starter when using the diesel bell
housing.  Is there a fuel tank that mounts in the front and straddles the
differential/drive shaft?

Please send comments to the above address because I am not currently
