Oops.  Didn't mean for that last one to go to the list.  It was rather 
odd to see the message &quot;New mail from Bob Hufford&quot; ... huh?

So this post isn't a complete waste if your time and bandwidth I'll let 
y'all know that Busses on '66' is now officially going to happen.  

More details to follow soon ...
