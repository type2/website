Subject: More #_at_!! Filter/Pumps


Screwed Again



For those of you who have followed my tribulations with the bolt-on
filter/pumps,  I got suckered in again.   I’ve had my hands of five of these
things now; four of them have been bad.  To keep from beating a dead horse,
take a look at my archived sermons on these things.  I think you’ll agree
I’ve given them a fair trial.

For background, the oil pump mounts in a machined bore in the rear of the
engine 
 where a tang on the pump’s driven-gear engages a slot in the middle of the
cam shaft, allowing the pump to spin at one-half engine speed.  The body of
the pump has to be a tight fit in the bore since the inlet and outlet ports
entire from the walls of the bore.  A loose fit means the pump won’t draw,
and what little it sucks in will just get sprayed through the gap if the
outlet isn’t tighter than a newlywed’s hug.  

Here’s some numbers that will make the situation a bit more clear.  To make
sure things are tight, Volkswagen machines the bore to about 2.7535”  and the
pump to 2.7570” .  When you gently tap the pump-body into the bore the .0035”
difference creates what’s called an ‘interference’ fit, the thing is tighter
than a bull’s ass at fly time, which is why you need a puller to get it out.
 And why the thing works.  (At operating temperature it’s not quite so tight
because the magnesium crankcase expands at a faster rate than the aluminum
pump body, but you get the idea.)

The filter/pump I got from J. C. Whitney, the second one from that source,
measures 2.7515” in diameter.  It’s so damn loose it rattles!  Flops into the
bore like a peach pit down a stove pipe.  

Here I am, slinging an engine together, trying to do a half-way decent job of
it and then I run into this piece of crap.  But what really gets my dander up
is the fact the last one I got from Whitney was a fine piece of goods.  

Alright -- I guess the joke’s on me.  Sitting here preaching about the evils
of after-market parts and how any damn fool should have enough sense to clap
a mike on anything that walks through the door, and then I get two pumps from
Whitney, check one and ASSUME the other is okay.  The Gotcha! done got me,
and I can’t even send it back -- I got the thing several months ago, the
papers probably went into the woodstove around Christmas.  I’ll throw it back
of the bench with my collection of Rusties and Ohmygawds!

But maybe I can keep the Gotcha! from getting you.
