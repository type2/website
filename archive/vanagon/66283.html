Your Viscous Coupling is locking up unnecessarily but don't despair, we
were able to eliminate this problem by experimentation. We reasoned that
either the differential was causing drag or the tires were dragging or
both.

We did two things:
1) changed the differential oil with  GL-4 SAE 80w90 Synthetic Gear Oil.
We used Amsoil and put the same in the transaxle.
2) adjust the tire pressure front and back. We found 43 psi front and
50.5 psi back best in our case with Yokohama Y370's. I've received
recommendations from others from 45 psi front/50 psi rear to 43 psi
front/53 psi rear and experimented until I had it just right for road
feel/side winds/CV lock up. I assume that you are using the same tires
on all four corners and that they have even wear Front/Back Right/Left.

&gt; to
&gt; be more than what one would expect from the vc on a tight turn....its
&gt; almost like the brakes are on...the vehicle will not roll freely...and
&gt;
&gt; it does not bind to this extent when not hot....
&gt;
&gt; am i doomed?  will changing the fluid help?  hurt?  i appreciate any
&gt; response....to this most disturbing symptom...effect....whatever...
