Subject: clay pot heaters

     So I was rambling around in the vanagon archives, and found that
     last winter there was a big thread among Westie owners about putting
     an inverted clay flower pot over the burners of the propane
     stove, getting the pot to radiate some heat.

     But I could not find any final report. Did anyone try this?
     I know I can buy a protable catalytic heater, etc, but I am
     wondering about a improvising something to use the Syncro
     Westie as a warming hut while cross-country skiing.

     (Of course, I would never do this without a source of fresh air).
