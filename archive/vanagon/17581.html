Subject: 71 bus, brakes, front end
Date: Mon, 15 May 1995 14:59:45 -0400 (EDT)

New subscriber needs help! I've just bought a 71 bus (1600 dual port) and 
need to do some pretty major brake work and maybe some front suspension 
work. 

1) The power brake system is beyond my expertise...is there a way to 
retro-fit a simpler non-power system to this bus?  The vacuum hoses are 
off, the bus will stop if you stand up on the brake pedal.  I don't need 
great stopping power...the bus is going to spend its final days on a 
small Gulf coast island with only sand roads and will never get over 40 
mph.  

2) All of the rubber boots protecting the ball joints have rotted away.  
Would it be easier to change them individually or replace the whole 
suspension system as a unit.  I've never worked with suspensions, but am 
willing to if it's doable.

Thanks in advance for any advice from anybody!  I have the Idiot's bible, 
Haynes manual, and a Chilton's manual.   Mitch
