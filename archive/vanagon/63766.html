Subject: insulation, undercoating, Kool Patch (wee-bit long)

Okay, I haven't yet lived up to my commitment to share ALL of my secrets of
sound-proofing and insulation in ONE posting, but I am working on it. A
couple of weeks, in the mean time...

We have all laid under our vans and wondered where in the world we could find
nice, thick, gooey, rubbery, asphalty, undercoating like VW plastered all
over the bottoms of our precious, expensive hobbies. We see chips and flakes
and want to do SOMETHING  about it...

Some of us have succommed to the temptation to purchase that pathetic spray
on undercoating, (15 coats = 1/64&quot; thick). Sad.

For those who REALLY want to deaden sound, and protect the metal of your van
from salt and debris, I finally found the product, and you will love the
price. It is marketed under the name &quot;Kool Patch&quot; made by the company &quot;Kool
Seal&quot; of Ohio,  you can find it in the roofing section of Hechingers. On the
gallon bucket, it offers itself as useful for a myriad of purposes, including
automobile undercoating.

As we are preparing (wife) Suzy's bus for a 9,000 mile jaunt to CA, Mexico,
and all points in between throughout the month of October, and all of the
interior is stripped and being reupholstered, I hesitantly bought a gallon
last weekend to coat all of the &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; interior surfaces. What a
difference!!! Tremendously reduced resonance, rattles and reverberations.
Absolutely seals against leaks and rust. Two coats can be (no joke) 1/4 inch
thick.

It appears to be precisely the same oozey goop that you see caked (and maybe
flaking?) on the exposed metal below your VW road home. At $8.57 a gallon,
you can't beat it. We have now applied three gallons, and will apply a fourth
this weekend. There is no obnoxious odor, it doesn't weigh 650 lbs (like
asphalt/rubber tiles), it cleans up with water (before it dries, afterward,
you'll need a jackhammer), and a cheap &quot;dollar store&quot; 3&quot; poly brush is
perfect for application.

I hope you can get as excited about undercoating as I am.

Keep 'em running,
