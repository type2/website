Subject: Need a new engine



I've started investigating engine places, and I haven't found too many that 
consistently get good reviews.

Places I've looked into:

GEX:			Consistently negative reviews(cheap prices)
Bernie Bergmann:	Good engines, bad service (high prices)
MOFOCO:			Consensus says stay away from these (mid prices)
Strictly Foreign:	Heard nothing about these guys on the list, 
                        knowledgable on the phone.  Don't like Bernie 
                        engines (sloppy), says GEX
                        not bad, but employees paid by the piece (prices mid)

Has anyone had an engine built that they were happy with?  From whom?

I can put the reviews for the various places on a web page if there is 
interest.

whose bus engine is a mess; lots of end play, valves need adjusting every couple
hundred miles, and #3 is 30psi
