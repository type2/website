&gt;&gt; My 70 westy has a rev counter and the speedo correlates well
&gt;&gt; showing 18 mph per 100 rpm,
&gt;          ^^         ^^^

&gt; So at 1,000 RPM (about where my bus idles when cold), you're going
&gt; 180 mph???

&gt; Yup, I'd say your speedo was a little off... That'll be $60, please.

Just catching up with the mail, but when I read the first
post, my impression was that the rpm was of the *wheel* not
the engine and that sam was looking for some help with wheel
size.  But then again, a &quot;rev counter&quot; is a tachomoter and
in any case if we were comparing rpm to mph, *much* would
depend on what gear we're in.

soooooo.  Sam, could you be more specific?  After all, if
you can (by Steve's count) get to 180MPH in a '70, us
splittie folk have a chance to get to 65MPH!  Keep in mind
that some folks have two extra jugs to get them where
they're going, the rest of us can just dream.
