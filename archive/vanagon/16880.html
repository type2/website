Subject: buying a type 1

Hi all

    I know this is a van list but I thought there may be a few type 1 
enthusiasts amongst you. After having so much fun driving the bus I 
have decided to sell the Vauxhall and buy a Beetle as well. Has 
anyone had any experience buying one and could they give me some 
advice on what to look out for, particularly the bodywork. Any help 
would be greatly appreciated.


                        Cheers
                             Jon
