&gt; 
&gt; I see this problem has come up again.  I tried to respond last week but my
&gt; machine was fouled.  My '87 came with the same problem when I got it last
&gt; spring.  I succeeded in stopping the rust by firstly removing the seam
&gt; goop in the seam between the two panels then clean and sand the seam well.
&gt; Then put on a *GOOD QUALITY* rust primer then paint the area.  THEN you
&gt; can FLOOD the seam with oil from the inside by removing the electrical
&gt; hookup cover and sqirting oil down the chanel that you will see.  You can
&gt; also access this chanel from under the sink cabinet by making a hole in the
&gt; panel board.  The chanel is just that, a chanel, and will hold the oil.  You
&gt; should see oil seeping to the outside in a few days, this is good and it
&gt; will stop the area from rusting again.  It's best to let the paint dry
&gt; well before the oil treatment.  Hope this is helpful !
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers 
&gt; 
&gt; Frank
 
	My question is,  where is the oil going to seep out?  Will it seep 
  out from underneath  the newly painted area? 
 
	How deep is this channel, I mean will oil seep inside? Would't a 
rust inhibitor work just as good?
