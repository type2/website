&gt; &gt; &gt;Jim &amp; Dean, I'm also very interrested in everyone's responses as I have a 1987
&gt; &gt; &gt;that exhibits a similar behavior (I think).  That is, when idling, the
&gt; &gt; &gt;RPMs will increase to about 2000 momentarily and then return to proper
&gt; &gt; &gt;idle speed.  Really weird the first time this happened while driving ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;I also have another problem that may or may not be related.  When I
&gt; &gt; &gt;first start the car in the morning, the idle is very rough and slow
&gt; &gt; &gt;(about 500 or so).  Sometimes the engine will stall, so I press the
&gt; &gt; &gt;accelerator slightly to keep the speed up. After a minute or two of
&gt; &gt; &gt;running, it's OK.  If it stalls though, it is very hard to restart and
&gt; &gt; &gt;sometimes there is the faint smell of gas.  Is it possible for it to be
&gt; &gt; &gt;choked too much ??!!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One other problem I didn't mention is that the car seemed sluggish and
&gt; hesitant after warm up.  Cold temperature performance was just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Joel wrote the following in response:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now THAT's the behavior of a bad temp coolant sensor! and if you drive off,
&gt; &gt; it will stall/die at stop signs and red lights. 
&gt; 
&gt; Today I'm THRILLED to report that I was able to replace the coolant temperature
&gt; sensor and that ALL of the above symptoms disappeared.  Starts right up and runs
&gt; right, no surging, no stalling and accelerates smoothly.  AND I got all this for
&gt; the $11.32 the dealer charged me for the sensor (and a $1.68 for the new o-ring
&gt; seal).
&gt; 
I just wanted to mention that I had similar symptoms and looking at my invoice, it
says that it was from a sticking idle valve.  I have investigated as what the idle
valve is, but it doesn't sound like the same thing as the coolant sensor Joel was
speaking of.  And yet, I had the exact same symptoms that Richard had.  Matter of
fact, I thought Richard had been drivin' my car. ;)  .  So what do a think?
