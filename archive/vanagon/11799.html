Subject: Re: Red Rock Potluck

&gt;So, folks, let's hear from you on what you wish to bring 
Friday - Bread
Saturday - Chili and 4gal. pot

&gt;Also, let's everyone bring whatever
&gt;kinds of spirits THEY want, rather than trying to &quot;potluckize&quot; that
&gt;category.  Anyway, I don't think any one person could bring enough
&gt;beer to suit SOME people I know on this list  :)

Since I missed out on the rainy-day fun at Pheiffer
I'm not sure what to expect. :)  I've got five gallons
of homebrew fermenting in anticipation of this event.
Everyone's welcome to it, as long as you return the bottles.

                               Wassail!
                                         Jack.
