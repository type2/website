&gt;  I've always taken the little bit of extra trouble to set them in the

&gt;  the engine counter-clockwise and thereby sending the oil in the oil pump
&gt;  and feed lines back to the sump doesn't appeal to me. I really don't
&gt;  know if this is a legitimate worry, however. Any thoughts?

&gt; &gt; If you start at 1, and turn the crank counter-clockwise, you get
&gt; &gt; 1-2-3-4.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think its real easy to remember.
