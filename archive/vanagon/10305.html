Joel,
  I got a question.  It is my understanding that a &quot;Microbus&quot; is only that bus
which has the dulux package(chrome, clock, ect.), moon windows and a rag top.
All other splits are classified as Kombi, Pickup, Panel, Camper. Is your list
calling all &lt;68 busses, micorbusses?

                                              Steve
