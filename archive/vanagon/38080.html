Subject: RE: Baywindow tire size/speedo error


In my Bug, I had to pull off the speedo needle to remove the front 
cover plate of the speedometer. After replacing it ('errrr, that's about 
0 mph...&quot;), my indicated speed was 10 mph too high at cruising speeds.

I wouldn't be surprised if Buses' are similar. 

Marking the needle/spindle would be the correct preventive action, but 
does any one know how to calibrate these things? Wait a minute, in the 
Bus, it would be easier: just attach the speedo to the cable under the 
dash and, while you match the speed of your friend's Bus, have a 
passenger stick the needle on at the agreed upon speed...

OK, tell me, is this a bad idea ?
