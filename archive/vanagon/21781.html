Subject:       Re: 1996 vanagon_at_lenti Tour Proposal!

Hi Folks.  My wife &amp; I did a similar trip in 1989 as to what Tobin is 
proposing.  We did this trip in 5 weeks, and covered 10,500 km of 
which over 8,000 km were dirt/gravel/shale.

I would be more than happy to share my experiences with anyone 
thinking of this trip.

Harry.

&gt; 
&gt; WHAT:	  Vanagon_at_lenti Top of the World Tour 1996
&gt; WHEN:	  August 1996
&gt; WHERE:	  To Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada (near the Arctic Ocean)
&gt; 	  This is the farthest north one can drive in North America.  
&gt; 	  There are no public roads in the Western Hemisphere that will 
&gt;           take you higher.  Oh, sure, there are ice roads in winter that 
&gt;           will take you a few miles north of Inuvik, but we'd need a few gas 
&gt;           heaters per bus to deal with 57 days of darkness and temps 
&gt;           down to -50 C (-60 F)!
&gt; WHY:	  You tell me. 
&gt; DURATION: 14 - 17 days return from Vancouver, B.C., Canada
&gt; WHO:	  Tobin Copley &amp; Christa Ovenell
&gt; 	  Martha and Sarah Rubin
&gt; 	  Bradley Prunehead?
&gt; 	  David Schwarze????
&gt; 	  Joel Walker?  (C'mon, you told me yourself how you've always 
&gt; 	 		 wanted to do this...)
&gt; 	  Absolutely anyone and everyone else who wants to join in!
