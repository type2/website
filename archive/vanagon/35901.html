&gt; Listies - I just received my beautiful oval, silver stickers from
&gt; Richard Palmer a few days ago.  I like them so much, that I'm ordering
&gt; some more, and I urge those of you who haven't done so, to order.  Or
&gt; those of you who think you can never get too much of a good thing,
&gt; to do so as well.  :) I think Richard still has around 200 left.

200? I just got mine. With only 200 left, I'd jump on it if I hadn't 
already. Those things will be selling as fast as $10 floor mats once 
people get a look at them!
