Subject: Re: 71 Westy and Door Handles


&gt;&gt;Regarding broken door locks on '71 type II's.  Mine is broken on the
&gt;&gt;drivers side.  My solution is to only unlock it from the outside.  If
&gt;&gt;it won't open I have to turn the key, several times, to the lock
&gt;&gt;position, then unlock.  Basically, turn the key back and forth until
&gt;&gt;it opens.
&gt;
&gt;I also have this problem on my 71.  I've procrastinated the repair and do
&gt;the &quot;key back and forth method&quot; of unlocking.  Unfortunately, the torque
&gt;generated from this puts a strain on the pot metal lock barrel, and I broke
&gt;the barrel on one door--it split in half and came out with the key.  I did
&gt;have a spare barrel around that matched the grooves in the key, so all I 
had
&gt;to do was switch over the brass tumblers from the old barrel and do a 
little
&gt;filing.  Since I don't have any more spare lock parts lying around, I 
should
&gt;replace the spring soon.
&gt;
&gt;As I remember, the spring we're talking about looks like a winding spring
&gt;you would find in an old clock.  Does anyone have the specs on that spring
&gt;so I can just buy a couple and put them in at my liesure?  In my case, the
&gt;springs aren't broken, just worn out and not doing their job of returning
&gt;the push button in the door handle.


Guys, professional locksmiths do this rebuilding/keying a dozen times
a day, every day. And they don't even charge much, it's so simple for
them.

Do yourself a favor, and let a pro handle this task! It'll free you up to
do the shift lever adjustment, seal the pop top, rebuild the engine, etc.!
