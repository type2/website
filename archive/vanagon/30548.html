This is all very interesting....

My 90 Synchro came complete (from PO) with an extension cord....male 
electrical plug dangling out near one of the towing hooks below the rear 
bumper.  Hooked up to 1.) CalRod type heater on the outside of the oilpan,  
2.) Immersion (?) heater in one of the raditor hoses (top of rad)  and 3.) a 
neat little heater plate under the battery.

The van originally came from Alaska, where I believe temps can be somewhat 
lower then our brisk 20F mornings....hence, I never use it.  I will mention 
that upon plugging it in after a good hosing off, the whole vehicle gets 
&quot;tingly&quot;....

&gt; With this cold weather I'm sure I'm not alone with starting problems, but
&gt; what's a guy to do?

I've got something called a &quot;Kat's Volkswagen Engine Heater&quot; on my '66 
camper and '63 bug.  It is a 150 Watt heater that bolts to the bottom of 
the engine and keeps the oil warm.  Both start and run reliably with no 
other modifications in extreme cold (The coldest I've started at is -47 F)

Anyway, Kat's makes two different models of the heater--one for upright 
engines and one for '72 and up (I'm not sure if it would fit the 
watercooled engines or not).  They cost about $20 and should be available 
in import auto part stores where ever it gets cold.  If you want one and 
can't find a source, let me know and I'll ship one out.  BTW, no 
affiliation with Kat's etc.
