&gt; My first problem with my Westy (91).  I went to leave the driveway today
and
&gt;  couldn't move a bit.  I determined one of the right rear wheel was locked.
&gt;  I jacked it up, pulled the wheel off and wacked the wheel with a hammer a
&gt;  few times.  It's good as new for now but I am afraid it will happen again.
&gt;  
&gt;  Can anyone suggest any preventative maintainance for this affliction?

First, I'll start by telling you about your weather.  It was raining when you
parked the van and you drove through several puddles on that last drive.  

When this happens, rust can quickly build up on the inside of the drum and
bond the shoe to the drum.  I'm not certain if this affects other vehicles,
but it's happend to my 87 Syncro a couple of times.  This can happen
overnight, and a mild case can happen (where you feel the resistance and
then, THUNK, it unsticks) just during a day at work.  It certainly hasn't
happened to any other vehicle I've driven.  In order to prevent it, I ride
the brake just a bit before I park, hoping to heat up the drum enough to
eliminate as much water as possible before parking.  I can't say for sure
that this works, but I haven't had this happen since I've started doing this.

Good luck,
