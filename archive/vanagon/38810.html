Subject: wheel question
Date: Tue, 2 Apr 96 17:56:30 EST

Hey all,
On my '78 bus, three of the wheels are looking pretty sad.  I want to
repaint them the factory color, that silver color.  I do have one wheel
that still looks new (as far as paint goes) to use as a guideline but my
question is what kind of paint should I use for this application?  Can I
use the spray stuff they sell in auto stores?  What color?  I'm sure
someone's done this job before, so any help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Sean
