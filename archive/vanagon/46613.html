&gt; rabbit filter in his bus.  I own a 86 Golf and my father has a 90 Golf and I
&gt; believe they use the same filters as the Rabbit. We have a case of these
&gt; so, If I can use this please let me know.  It will save me a trip and to be

The Golf filter is the same as the Rabbit, which I'm *almost* 
positive is the same as the a/c T4 filter, (and the waterboxer filter 
for my '88). As far as I know, *all* 4 cyl gas VW/Audi/Porsche 
engines have always used the same filter. (except the G60).
