John (and others)

I'm sure others can add more to this,  but be carefull with polyurethane, it
will keep expanding for some time during installation and can expand enough
to destroy your panels,  but more imporant,  in a fire it is DEADLY...  DO
NOT hang around if it catches fire!!!

Fiberglass and rockwool can add a lot of irritants in the air for you to
breathe.  The movement of the van while on the road can constantly shed tiny
fiber particles that find their way out of any crack.

Those are my only two known problems, but don't take my word on it, there are
many types of insulations and many ways to apply them.  I'm hoping others
will have more to say about this..............

And while we're on the subject,  I'm interested if anyone has experimented
with ways to increase the efficiency of the AC by treating the windows with
coatings, films or shades.  I have the stock Westy windows in an 87 GL
Syncro.  Any ideas???
