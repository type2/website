&gt; &gt;&gt;The canvas is the child cot that goes over the front seat.  Just not =
a very
&gt; &gt;&gt;big child.

i often wondered what is the maximum amount of weight those cots will =
hold=20
before those 3/4&quot; screws pull out of the door pillars and the cot comes =
crashing=20
to the ground??


In my bus, I found a VW pamplet for the Westfalias designed for the =
salespeople.  It indicates that the &quot;childs hammock&quot; is designed to hold =
up to 50 pounds. =20

Also in the same pamplet was a cartoon of a Westy parked next to a beer =
truck with the driver of the Westy saying, &quot;Fill her up!&quot; :-)
VW knew I would buy one of these!
