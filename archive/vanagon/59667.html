&gt;Greetings,
&gt;
&gt;Just purchased my first vanagon, an 87 westie synchro.  I Have a few
&gt;questions:

A what? Oh, you meant a westie 'syncRo', look for the stickers :). Just
kidding, it's (still) friday in western Europe... Congratulations, welcome
to the Syncro world.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Any suggestions on the best motor oil to use?

Mobil 1 synthetic.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Whats the brand name of the suggested coolant (the kind thats easier
&gt;    on the heads as far erosion is concerned).

The genuine VW is called G 11.
&gt;
&gt;3.  Where can I find the EPA emissions label?  I bought it out of CA
&gt;    (where i live) and am trying to find if it was ever certified for CA
&gt;    emissions (will save me $300).

&gt;
&gt;4.  I have very slow leaks from heads 1 and 3 (not enough to even drip
&gt;    on the ground, but can see some coolant).  Must these be replaced
&gt;    immediately?  Will waiting a while increase the chance of
&gt;    significant erosion that could cause the need for engine
&gt;    replacement?  The mechanic that inspected the van said i could (its
&gt;    a crap shoot) get 20k before needing to replace...this worries me..

I'd wait a little till it get's worse.
&gt;
&gt;5.  Guess thats it for now, but any helpfull hints or info would be
&gt;    greatly appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;peace,
&gt;
