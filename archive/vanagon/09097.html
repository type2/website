Geez!

	Ok, got started this AM at about 9:00, still a little sleepy after last 
night.

	We managed to get the reduction boxes together without too much heartache,
and I got to weld some on the back deck, and welded in the new battery tray.

	It was slow going because we were being very cautious, since we are
doing a converion and an installation.  We also took the clutch pedal
apart and cleaned the mechanicals up so I don't have to reach down and
pull it up by hand anymore!

	Now the problems start:

	I went to fill it up with fluid, and I'm pumping away, coming down
tothe bottom of a gallon of juice, and the damn thing is LEAKING! $%$_at_$_at_#!
It is leaking where the 6-bolt flange that holds the axle tube on goes.
Called Ray's buddy in Idaho, a veritable bus Guru, and he sez its no
problem, just put some permatex on it and it should be fine.  So we had to
take this plate off, tranny in car, to do this operation.  Very, very 
difficult, due to space restrictions. 

	So we put it back together, and I start putting fluid in again.  Its
leaking again!  Turns out this time its 'cause ray didn't tighten one of
the nuts on the side plate, so now where back to square 1.  BTW - 
how long should you let RTV sealant dry before putting fluid in the tranny?

	Tomorrow morning, I am going to see if it is still leaking.  Unless
some miracle has occurred and it stopped, I'm gonna have to take it apart 
again and re-seal it.  Argghh!

	The wheels are on, we put in new rear wheel seals, and the brakes
were already new, so all that stuff is groovy!  I want to try to replace
the piece of engine tin behind the pully, but that mayt have to wait for
another day :(

	All told, this has been the most aggravating part of the whole bus
project.  The biggest problem is lack of accurate information on the
subject of split-case to tunnel case conversion.  Bus Boys was about as
much help as a keyboard up the nose.

	Oh, and the tranny came with the WRONG starter bushing.  Anticipating
this potential problem, during out parts run yesterday, I asked for one,
and was told I didn't need it, the correct one was already in there.  NOT!

	Anyway, this is definitely one procedure that shouldbe written up for
the archives!
