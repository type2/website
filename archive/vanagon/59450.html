&gt;&gt;*Welcome to the new world!* =(
&gt;&gt;If you see any car driving without their lights on (at night) DO NOT blink
&gt;&gt;your lights at them. Even though you might be thinking that you are doing a
&gt;&gt;good deed in desire for saftey, you are, in fact, placing yourself in
&gt;danger.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself the
&gt;&gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt;&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally left
&gt;&gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks their
&gt;&gt;lights at them intending to add to the safety factor. The good samaritian
&gt;&gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter. 
&gt;
&gt;This is an urban legend hoax.  You might want to check out:
