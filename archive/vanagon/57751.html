Subject: Front Turn Signals

   Hey All :
Does anyone know where I can buy front turn signals for my '71 bus? 
These are the rectangular kind which ride just above the left and right sides 
of the front bumper. I've seen these in yards before, unshattered, but they 
seem to turn grey/white over time, perhaps as a result of sun, weather, and 
numerous tiny, tiny cracks...
SO can anyone point me at aftermarket availability for these
   (or for the rear side running lights for a bus?)
Thanks in advance for any and all help!    - Mick
