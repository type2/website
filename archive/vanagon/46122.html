Subject: High Sierra Music Festival etc.

Hello,

I've been quiet for a long while, but I had an experience that is 
just too excellent. The High Sierra Music festival  Up at Big Bear in 
California.  It was amazing how many (:&gt;) VW Bus's showed up. I think 
the most interesting part of the festival was when they opened the 
gate to let the cars in and almost all of the bus's (breadloaf) had 
to be pushed start. A few vanagons (including mine) had to crank over 
several times to start. The elevation was at about 7500 ft. I think.

Anyways aside from the cool music and excellent location, I mounted a 
summit  through the Sierras through Emmets (sp?) pass on route 4. An 
incredible journey. However, the hills and the heat proved too much 
for the bus (yet unamed after a year and a half, suggestions welcome) 
and the oil light went a flickering, suggesting that hull-breach was a 
few seconds away. So we pulled over and played in the snow-pack until 
the engine cooled down. 

When I looked underneath, oil was leaking from the seal where the 
engine and transmission connect. I imagine the seal is blown or at 
least damaged. However there has not been any leaking since.

Curiously, just as my light started to flash on the idiot board, I 
rounded a curve and there was another vanagon westie with the hazard  lights 
flashing, and  as I trundled by, the shocked owner begged for a splash of 
oil. I flet for him dearly, but I only had one qt. left and I was 
thinking about getting to Tahoe (a side stop).

Anyways, I am now convinced that the unamed bus can go anywhere on 
paved surfaces. I guess that is not bad for an engine that 115k on it 
with only a head gasket replacement.

If anyone gets a chance next year to go to the High Seirra concert, I 
recommend it highly...
