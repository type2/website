This was it. I had a corroded/broken ground connector at this cluster caused
by a previous windshield leak.  I also had a broken circuit copper trace on
the instrument panel. 

A little solder and connectors did the trick!

Thanks,

&gt;&gt;I had an intermittant failure of the three instrument panel lights 
&gt;&gt;that come
&gt;&gt;on with the headlight switch when I bought my 84' Vanagon last Dec.  
&gt;&gt;I'd
&gt;&gt;turn on the lights and the instrument panel lights might have come on
&gt;&gt;minutes later. They seemed to fix themselves and lighted for a few 
&gt;&gt;months.
&gt;&gt;Then after removing the radio, the instrument panel lights were gone 
&gt;&gt;again.
&gt;&gt;I found and bypassed a torn copper trace on the instrument panel where 
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;14 point wire connector mates.  Then the instrument panel lighted with
&gt;&gt;ignition key off and the headlight switch on.  However, with the van
&gt;&gt;running, no instrument panel lights, no turn signals, no windshield 
&gt;&gt;wipers.
&gt;&gt;I turned off the ignition key and everything worked. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I tried disconnecting my repairs (including a disconnected wire to the 
&gt;&gt;right
&gt;&gt;heater blower dashboard light and the auto transmission position 
&gt;&gt;light), and
&gt;&gt;have no instrument panel lights, no turn signals, no windshield 
&gt;&gt;wipers.
&gt;&gt;Also, now the blue highbeam indicator light is always on when the 
&gt;&gt;ignition
&gt;&gt;key is on.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Are there any places where the electrical system is vulnerable to wear 
&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;shorting out?
&gt;&gt;Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks!
