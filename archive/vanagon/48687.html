Subject: in support of ken

everyone who is complaining that ken is trying to 'charge' us to be
members of the type2 list, listen up.

he is not trying to do any such thing.  he is simply offering to produce
shirts and stickers, carrying the logo of the list _he created_!  ken
goes through a lot, not just financially, to keep this thing going; we
should not be so harsh and quick to judge.

ken's only intention in 'profiting' fromt his shirt/sticker sales is to
finance the function of this list.  would you rather he just cancelled
it instead?  he is doing this because he loves vans and loves talking
about them, not to make money.  as the saying goes, 'do not look a gift
horse in the mouth.'

i for one would be happy to pay for some stuff, even if the prices are
just a bit more than the actual cost to produce it.

everyone:  be nice, and realise that he is doing us all a favour!
