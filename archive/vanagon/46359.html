Subject: Trip Preperations

Greetings and salutations once more,
        My girlfreind and I will be leaving on Aug. 3rd for a two week
excursion out to the west coast and Im starting to get things ready for it,
and would love some input.
        Things I have to get done on the van before I leave are a) new
seals for the pop top which Ill be ordering from California Imports
tommorow since they were the cheapest around. b) NEW TIRES..now Ive been
following the banter about tires here for awhile but have come to no
definte conclusion on what the hell I should invest in. I am presently
riding on Continental TS 750 185 R14's  (which is all greek to me BTW). I
was thinking about just getting the same, but some people here think
Conti's aint that sh*t hot. There was mention of the Yokohama Y370's being
solid...any other suggestions?
        Other than that I must also get a oil change..put some of that
brake squeek stopper stuff on, and although I hate myself for even thinking
this...I was going to take it to the miney sucking shop to gewt them to
make sure everything is all tickityboo and ready for trippin.
        What Id like to know is if anyone has other suggestions for things
I should get checked before I leave, and other things I should take with me
'just incase'.

        And...if there's anyone in Vancouver (or area) that wouldnt mind
giving me there # or address so that 'just incase' something happens I have
a contact, instead of spending all my trip money on a tow and fix.

thank you very much.
