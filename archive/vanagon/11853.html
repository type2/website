Is this the full throttle switch which sits atop the throttle andis
connected to a small black box? If so there was a mini-thread on this awhile
ago.

I have replaced the box and tested and adjusted the switch with no
*noticeable* improvement. Someone said it was necessary to richen the
mixture and or cut off the O2 sensor at full throttle....is this correct?...DC
