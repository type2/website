Subject: AUDI Turbo Rims - WARNING


Hello all,

If you decide to use AUDI Turbo Rims on your Vanagon,
take following into account:

AUDI Turbo Rims, Part No. 437 601 025 C, are built
to carry 520 kg (1146 lb) each.

This means, a Vanagon equipped with this rims will
carry a reduced load of 1040 kg (2292 lb) per axle.

Vanagons are built to carry 1100 kg (2425 lb) on front,
and 1300 kg (2866 lb) on rear axle. At total maximum
weight of a Vanagon should not exceed 2360 kg (5202 lb).

On German rights it's not allowed to put this rims
onto a Vanagons without reduced maximum weight per axle
found on the vehicle license papers.

For more details read my mail 'AUDI Turbo Rims - My Story'
sent to this list.

Helmut
'80 Camper
