Subject: Grease Needles for CVs, Rabbit Joke /f

	Friends,
	A needle fitting for your grease gun is a standard tool-store
item. Before you go out and punch holes in your CV boots, however,
stop and ask yourself, if the old grease is missing, where did it go?
If the old grease isn't missing, what good will shooting more into the boot
to? I've done a complete CV replacement and its a mess- took Ian and
I 8 hours start to finish to do both axles on my Rabbit one Saturday.
But IMHO, repacking means disassemble, clean and re-grease. Anything else
and you're just fooling around.

	I happily paid about $100 labor for someone else to clean,
inspect and replace all four CVs for my '70 single cab. I was feeling
rich and I saved a day on the project. Four new joints, installed on
my axles, cost $53x.00 including labor and tax, so having it done
only changed the price about 20%. 

	If you're bound and determined to do the needle thing, try this:
Loosen the clamp that seals the small end of the CV boot around
your axle. Now plug the needle fitting into your grease gun, then
carefully slide the needle inbetween the boot and the axle shaft. Remember
that there's a ridge in the axle shaft just inside the boot, which you'll
have to get the needle *over*

	Got the needle in all the way? Pump grease to your heart's contentment.
Uses a 5mm or 1/4&quot; wide nylon tie-wrap to reclamp the boot. And don't
expect your CV to last very long. 

	If you do the right thing and disassemble and clean and
repack, you'll want to change the boots. Wrap some duct tape over the splines
on the axle shaft when you put on the new boot- that way the sharp edges
of the splines won't cut the boot.

	John Hopp-
	In saying someone should give you a Rabbit, I was making what I 
hoped would be a well recieved and obvious reference to your last name. 
Wolfsport up in Marin County used be called Recyled Rabbit and I believe 
had a tee shirt with the moto: &quot;Non-Stop Hop&quot;.

	I guess I'd pick &quot;That _Rabbit is a really fine car&quot; of
the four sample sentences you offered. My ol' Flopsy was still
running strong at 209,000 miles, with the original bottom end of
the engine and over 120,000 miles on the rebuilt head.
