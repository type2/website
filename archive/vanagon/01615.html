&gt;While we're on the subject of c.v. joints, I have a problem with my '73
&gt;that nobody I've spoken to has experienced. There is a low frequency
&gt;shake from the transmission. It's intermittent, sometimes really bad other
&gt;times hardly noticable but dissappearing on the over-run or when not in
&gt;gear. It feels like the engine and gearbox are wobbling back and forth on
&gt;their mounts but these look in good condition. A parts shop suggested
&gt;it was a seized c.v. joint. This sounded plausible, especially since the
...
&gt;now as bad as ever. So, before I shell out for a new joint, what is the
&gt;verdict of the net-jury? Is the c.v. joint guilty or not guilty? (The
&gt;sentence is death by hurling it at the garage wall)

well, in my experience (admittedly one-sided), joints give pretty good
notice of their impending demise. by making noises.

that shaking doesn't sound like a cv-joint to me. i'd check the balance of
the wheels, and take another hard look at the motor mounts and transmission
mounts (just guessing here). if it were the cv-joint, i don't think it would
be intermittent ... it should do it under certain high-load circumstances
(like hills and corners), or all the time. and there should be clicking or
knokking noises.

shaking sounds and feels are more likely to be something loose or about to
become loose.
