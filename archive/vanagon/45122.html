&gt; tachs that redline well over 5000rpm.

Anyone care to comment on this topic when it comes to waterboxers? My 
'88 shows 2500-4500 rpm as the 'green' zone on the tach, and 5250 (I 
think) as the redline. During our last trip, I drove 3rd gear at 
about 4200-4400 rpm for up to 20 minutes at a time with no problems. 
Temp gauge usually went down slightly - climbing the same hills in 
4th at 2800 rpm or so caused temp to rise slightly. I felt it better 
to rev higher &amp; keep the coolant moving...
Is 4500 a safe speed for extended periods like this?
