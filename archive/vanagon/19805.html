Hi,

	This is uncharacteristic of me to post something like this, I know, but...

	My boss's boss has an 8x cabriolet.  Whenever it gets hot outside, and
he's driving along, the car will start to &quot;drag.&quot;  He says if he lets it cool
a while, its fine.

	Everyone's guessing vapor lock.  I've never experienced this - what do you
do about it?  Any cures/preventions or any way to verify the diagnosis?

Thom
