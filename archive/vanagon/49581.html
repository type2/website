A 
&gt;&gt; replacements . They all insisted that this Vehicle has no universal joints.
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know of a suitable replacement or have a part #. VOA wants well
&gt;&gt; over $145- EACH. Ouch.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;          Out smart them... GO to the FLAPS get the closes next bigger
&gt;          U-joint you can find. Take the shaft and the new U-joint
&gt;          to your friendly machinest and say &quot;make it fit&quot;
&gt;

&gt;Have you actually done this? I was thinking about it butt when I looked
into it I saw it was a pretty nasty job. I think a driveline shop would
charge plenty.
