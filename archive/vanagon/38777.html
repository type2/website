Subject: 1977 Camper Van - $2,000 Too much???

Hi,

Looking at a 1977 vw camper van with a whale top for sale at a dealer's.
There's 42,000 on the odometer so suspect that's really 142,000 miles. Runs
good, newish tires, no oil leaks, interior is good shape for almost 20
years old. They're asking 2,000 for it which seems a bit steep but they are
willing to take a jeep as trade in (bluebook on Jeep is $5,000 but needs
$2,000 body work) and give $1,000 approx cash.
They have no history on the van, figure maybe 5 previous owners. Any
thought on whether this is a good deal?
Or yah, no to little rust, Oregon interior not the coast.

Thanks,
Peg
