Subject: Re: More questions on my '85

&gt; 
&gt; I hope I am not being to much of a pain here,  I have lotsa questions.
&gt; 
&gt; When the engine is cold on this '85, the idle is about 900-1000 RPM.  
&gt; When warmed up to normal operating temperature the idle increases to 
&gt; 1400-1600 RPM.  The van also seems to be getting not so good gas 
&gt; mileage--not sure of the figures (and in fact, I don't know how much the 
&gt; tank really holds) but in 90 miles of driving, I have used 1/2 tank 
&gt; according to the fuel gauge.

I have an '84 and the gas gauge is not linear.  I hit 1/2 tank around
100+ miles and fill up around 250 miles with the needle in the red
taking on 12-13 gallons.  I believe the tank has a 16 gallon capacity.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, could someone explain the heater/fresh air controls, they seem 
&gt; indordinately complicated (I also have a rear heater as well).  The four 
&gt; levers seem like a carry over from the old '71 bus but I don't think 
&gt; right and left have much to do with the controls.

I thought this was an impossible control system to figure out until I
made the connection between top-to-bottom and front-to-back.  The top
lever controls the windshield/defrost vents (right = more, left = less
as depicted by the white triangle above the lever).  The second lever 
controls the temprature (left = fresh air, right = fresh air passed over
the front heater core).  The third lever from the top controls the air
flow at your feet (left = more, right = less).  The last lever controls
fresh (non heated) air flow to the vents above the windows in the back
of the bus (left = more, right = less).

Typical summer setting (no A/C, maximum fresh air flow):

	---------------------------
	| ----------------------# |	Windshield
	| #---------------------- |	Temp
	| #---------------------- |	Feet
	| #---------------------- |	Passenger
	---------------------------

Maximum fresh air, non heated defrost:

	---------------------------
	| ----------------------# |
	| #---------------------- |
	| ----------------------# |
	| ----------------------# |

Maximum fresh hot air defrost:

	---------------------------
	| ----------------------# |	
	| ----------------------# |
	| ----------------------# |
	| ----------------------# |
	---------------------------

Typical cool weather setting:

	---------------------------
	| --------------#-------- |	
	| --------#-------------- |
	| ----------#------------ |
	| ----------------------# |

Maximum fresh hot air flow:

	---------------------------
	| ----------------------# |	
	| ----------------------# |
	| #---------------------- |
	| ----------------------# |

Shut it down to run the A/C
