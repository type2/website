Subject: FS '91 Syncro Westie $13K
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

In the Annapolis MD area Rick Steele has his '91 Syncro Westie seriously
for sale. His advertised price is $13K. 
 
 I spoke with him and found out the following: It has 88,000 miles on it
and has just replaced the driveshaft. Color is white, the  
standard grey interior. Two small spots of rust reported near the 
back and a side window, obviously need immediate attention. 
It has the usual late Westie equipment, power windows, power and heated
mirrors, etc.  Some European Westfalia options, but no 
tent. Alpine CD.  
 
E-mail Rick direct at mtghouse_at_aol_dot_com, or call him 
evenings ONLY at (410) 224-3120. He has people looking  
at the vehicle Monday and Tuesday nights, I recommend 
moving fast on this... 
 
If some distant party comes to a price agreement with him 
over the phone subject to inspection, I could arrange a 
looksee. I have not seen the vehicle.
