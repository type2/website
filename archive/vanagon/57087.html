Yes that list exists on the archives, but it's only really useful if
you're going to a junkyard.  The list is a cross-reference for the
various vehicles that had that identical part/part number.  It doesn't
cross-reference what also will work (i.e. generic O2 sensor instead of
Bosch, rabbit whatever instead of stock, etc).  I think that is what was
originally wanted/asked for.

It would be VERY useful to know that a such-n-such part would work just
fine on a vanagon (a cheaper such-n-such, or perhaps better) with the
disclaimer type info such as 'you'll have to enlarge the bracket that
holds it' or 'you'll need to add this clamp' or 'cut-n-splice wires'. 
You know, give what's really required to do the change and any drawbacks
to using the 'other' part instead of the stock part.

I think this would be great to have.  I even volunteer to put it
together if people send me the info.  I'm not looking for alternate
parts just for the price (although it IS a big incentive), but if there
are BETTER parts, that's just as important.
