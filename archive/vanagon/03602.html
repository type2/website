Yes, Andrew, leaving a note would have been the civil thing to do; however
the concensus vote was for the pinup (and I wasn't the one who thought of it). 
Except for the choice of reading material (as Ray pointed out earlier),
I felt this &quot;prank&quot; was relatively harmless.  If I get a chance to repeat this
in another life, I'll leave a note on the *inside* of the windshield,
will that work?  ;-)
