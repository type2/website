Subject: Wasserboxer fuel injectors

Vanagoneers,

I recently had a leak from a fuel injector.  The injector body or connection
did not leak but there was a small cut in the 1&quot; long rubber hose that
connects the injector to the fuel manifold.  Otherwise the injector is just
fine.  I think the hose was accidently cut when the auto wrecker removed this
engine from its previous home and cut a few coolant hoses in the process.
 The hose seems permanently attached to the body of the injector.  
I wonder if a shop with some specialty tools can replace this bit of hose at
a reasonable price? 
Also, I was recently quoted prices for rebuilt injectors.
What gets &quot;rebuilt&quot; in a rebuit injector?
Is replacing this hose part of a rebuild?
