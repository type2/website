Subject: Re: [Q] 2nd battery again

I've done a lot of sailing over the years, so maybe it was natural that
I put in this exact system.  Didn't trust the isolator the RV place
recommended.  However...

&gt; 
&gt; I know in the sailboats we've chartered, they ususally have 2
&gt; cranking batteries with a switch that controls flow to and from the
&gt; batteries with the following options:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - 2 - both - none
&gt; 
&gt; When running the diesel or on shore power, we set the switch to
&gt; &quot;both&quot; to keep a charge on both.

You have an automatic battery charger?  Wow.

  When running lights and
&gt; instruments with the diesel off (preferred mode, of course :-), we
&gt; use battery 1 on odd-numbered dates and battery 2 on even-numbered
&gt; dates.

Not good.  You always want to keep one battery fresh for engine
cranking.  The same should apply to any extensive camping you do.  Turn
it to your weakest battery, do not use the other except for cranking.

  When going ashore, we set the switch to &quot;none&quot; to avoid
&gt; anything bleeding the system with anything we accidentally left on.

Right, but if you do this you will lose your radio station settings.
