Well, I don't recommend anywhere outside.  We made a wooden rack that fits
over the engine such that we can have one row of suit cases under and two 
bikes over mounted horizontally.  The front wheels come off of course, and 
the kids just stuff 'em somewhere.  I don't care where as my knees are bad 
too !

All this and we still fit two adults, three kids, and one golden retriever
inside too.  Just what Vanagons are for ...
