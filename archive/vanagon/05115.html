Wow Joel! That was great, now can you send the same instructions for the
Vanagon? :&gt; Just kidding.....-the trip computer seems like a better idea,
and the second best would be to fix the sender as jackrstarfleet
recommended...

I guess this says something about my age, but my father had the kind of
VW's you were talking about when he was young- with the reserve tank,
semaphores and small
oval. (He also drove something called the DKW (Das Kleine Wunder) 2 stroke 
--  german car.) Later in life (after he had sold that one to  a student
who promptly put their feet through the floor) we kids would hang on to the
running boards of his  bugs as my father
drove off to work and jump off as he approached the school - I guess we were a
little more naive back then about car safety....
