Bad Day (tm) Today

Driving along 80 to this AM, thinking what a wonderful heater I have (did
some fixing last night - lotsa heat now!) when the bus sputtered and died.
Out of gas.  Went to reach for the magic fuel lever, but suddenly I realized
I played that ace last night, and forgot to get more gas! D'oh!

Call from one of those wonderful yellow phones that have sprouted
up along the highways (be patient, it takes forever for them to answer) and
they called my SO who showed up with a gas can, and we went and got gas,
and she drops me off back at the bus.

Put gas in.  While I'm doing this I see a black scrape where some &amp;^*%_at_
scraped it in a parking lot or something :(

Gas is done, go to start it, and &quot;gee, the gas pedal doesn't have much
resistance&quot; thing starts happening.  So I Mc Gyver the throttle cable
(broken at the front) with a brake return spring I found in the tool bag,
which worked, but only gave me about 10% throttle.

Limped back home, put in the new cable I bought last week(!) and finally
set out to work.

When I get to work, several people come up to me a various times and
cheerfully say &quot;Hey!  I saw your bus on the side of the freeway this morning!&quot;
