Subject: '89 Syncro loses power in rain

Corrina:

I had a similar problem with my '88 GL.  When wet, it would stutter a
couple times and then die completely, but would start right back up.
This would repeat itself until the engine warmed up, at which point it
would run fine, even in pouring rain.

I brought the car to the dealer twice and another mechanic once.  The
second time, the dealer kept it for three weeks where it became known
as the &quot;carwash car&quot; because they had to keep bringing it to the
carwash across the street to reproduce the product.  They replaced the
distributor and air flow meter (at dealer prices - $$$!!!).  For some
reason the problem went away for a few weeks, but then returned!

By this time I was shopping for a new van.  Fortunately, I had
recently subscribed to this newslist, and with Uncle Joe's prodding, I
began to look around the engine compartment.  Basically, I sprayed
water on one part of the ignition at a time and then started the
vehicle (which is what the #*_at_&amp;% dealer should have done).  Turns out
that a previous mechanic had spliced a replacement O2 sensor to the
part of the wiring harness that runs next to the exhaust pipe to the
catalytic converter.  The local heat had melted some of the insulation
and exposed the wiring and voila!  Whenever the van got wet the 02
sensor would short out the ECU.  Once the exhaust got hot enough the
wiring would stay dry enough to function.

So I don't know what your problem is . . .but neither does your
dealer!
