&gt; David Schwarze and Bradley both got special mention for being &quot;cool guys&quot; and I

&gt; cars. I believe the quote was: &quot;I'm interested in anything that can get that
&gt; much wheelspin......&quot;. Siena worries that Bradley may be drinking to much &lt;?!&gt;.
&gt; Special thanks go to Steve Johnson, who shared his campsite with us and to 
&gt; Jack Stafford who drove us on the &quot;desert adventure&quot;. 

Cool... I got a &quot;cool guy&quot; award.  :)  Sorry I didn't try to corrupt your 
kids, maybe next time.  And how could I possibly drink to much?  I never 
passed out or had a hangover.
