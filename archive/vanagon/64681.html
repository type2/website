Subject:      Vacation time in the Rockies :)

Hi Everyone.  Well, it's vacation time for Colleen and I with our '90
Syncro Westy.  We are off from Vancouver, BC to the Canadian
Rockies.  We plan on nearly three weeks vacation between Banff, and
Jasper, Alberta.

We plan on doing some light hiking (just recovering from a broken
foot), and doing some scouting of new base camps for us to stay next
year for more hiking.  We are also planning a week in the Okanagan
district of BC.

Hopefully the weather won't be too bad.  We are really looking
forward to the cool, crisp air, lots of wildlife, and meeting up with
friends enroute. We'll be leaving Sept 2, but have lots to do before
we leave so I've unsubscribed for now, and will return in October!!

Take care,
Harry.
