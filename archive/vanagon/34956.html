So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648 says:
&gt; The west coast makes me crazy with its huge selection and low prices for
&gt; VW vans.  There should be a federal program to move VW vans inland at
&gt; least as far as the Great Divide so that we don't lose them when the
&gt; Big Earthquake shakes all the other cars into the Pacific.
&gt; 
&gt; Here in New Jersey, any VW van that touches the ground in exactly 
&gt; four places is worth $1000 to somebody.

Well, if you would get your damn agency's to quit pouring salt on
the roads, you would have this problem.  ;)
