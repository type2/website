John,

FWIW.

My PO of recently purchased 89&gt;syncro&lt;GL had 4 Yakima (extended height) racks
on the van. 3 of these on top ( rear top rack mounted as far back as
possible) and the 4th mounted low down on the rear hatch (had removed
&quot;Syncro&quot; badge...)

He carried 2x Kayaks and 2 x cycles (or skis) on top/rear.

Yakima fittings on the racks were 2 &quot;kayak&quot; shaped bowls on the front rack.
 2 x Bungee cords to hold the rear of the Kayaks to 2nd top rack, while the
cycles were mounted on rear top rack down to rear hatch rack....  now only if
we had graphics..

e.g.
     ______________
     \_____________/
    __|___________|_______|   Bikes or skis on rear
   /                                     |
  /                                       |
 /    ___                    _____   |__
|__/      \__________/        \__|
     \__/                     \___/
