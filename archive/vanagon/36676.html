&gt; anytime soon.  He said there is talk about bringing in a very limited

&gt; be very limited and the only model available will probably be an MV, with
&gt; VR6, and automatic.  Personally the feeling I got from this guy was that he
&gt; really didn't want to talk about the Eurovan and he really left me with the

Seems VWUSA is caught up in this silly war with the rice rockets and
doesn't want to try to sell a &quot;practical&quot; vehicle for its own sake.
Minivans have the floor these days, and the media (consumer reports et al.)
frenzie to convince all the manufacturers that every van MUST copy the
Mopars in order to sell has them convinced that the EV won't sell and so
they aren't interested in it.  Similar to the nonsensical pendulum swings
in politics.  Everybody flocks to Rush and Salamander, so Democrats are
villains for a few years, then...

I for one would like to see a variety of choices in vans, from Minis to
Full-size pigs.  Having only the Chevy Astros in the mid-size category
(without the EV available) doesn't inspire me.  They ought to at least
allow an individual to purchase a US-smogged version of one of the
interesting EV models (like a Syncro!) while on a tour of Europe (like they
used to do with the Westfalias) and ship it home for a reasonable cost.
