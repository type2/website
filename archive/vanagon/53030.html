&gt; In order not to destroy this very expensive viscous coupling, could anyone

&gt;  them on the 4 wheels?

That's an excellent question.  I would guess that while on slippery surfaces,
chains on just the rear would be fine, since there would likely be enough
slippage under all the wheels to relieve drivetrain binding.

However, driving over a stretch of asphalt would be another situation
entirely.  I suppose a very short stretch (100yds??) would likely not be a
problem, but a longer run would surely increase your chances for damage.

I carry two sets of chains when heading into snow country.
