&gt; That's cheap.  When I was 22, with no tickets etc., they wanted $1200/year
&gt; for one car (bus or chevy) and $1700 for both.  That's for CA minimum, on
&gt; cars probably worth less than $1700 together.  The reasons it was so high, is
&gt; I was under 25, and I had had my license for less than 3 years.  Now that 
&gt; I'm 26 I can get one covered for $400/year... still not cheap.

21st Century has cheap insurance.  I am 29 and I pay $370/year to insure
a late model V-8 Mustang, and I'm single.  In addition, I have slightly 
more than minimum coverage on it:

25/50,000 bodily injury liability
Uninsured Motorist
Uninsured Motorist property damage
Medical payment coverage for others in my car

The bare minimum Calif. coverage is 15/30,000 liability.  When I am
driving my bus also, they charge me about another $180/year. Ouch.

I have no affiliation with 21st Century, other than as a satisfied
customer.  They have a 1-800 number in the white pages.
