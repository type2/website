Whoa!

Strange happenings! I have been experiencing the exact same problem with
my 88 Westy for a couple of weeks. I was about to post the same question
to the list server.  I have also noticed that with somewhat warmer
outside temps (in the 50's) the ide will drop to 1500 after warmup. But
now that the temperatures are back in the 30's and below I have the
exact same problem.:-(

&gt;
&gt;Hopefully someone can help me out with this.  The conditions are as
&gt;follows:
&gt;
&gt;1. Dead cold morning start:  starts and idles fine until as long as you
&gt;don't touch accelerator pedal.
&gt;
&gt;2. As soon as you start driving the rpms will only drop to 2,000 between
&gt;shifts.  If you are driving above 2,000 rpms and take you foot of the
&gt;accelerator it will only also only drop to 2,000.
&gt;
&gt;3. Stop at Starbucks for the morning &quot;fix&quot;, 2 to 3 minutes after dead
&gt;cold start.  Motor will not hold 900 rpm idle.  Slow idle down by
&gt;letting clutch out a touch, but idle creeps back up to 2,000 and holds
&gt;there.
&gt;
&gt;4. After warming up (normal op temp), rpms still don't drop below 2,000
&gt;between shifts.  However I can now &quot;force&quot; 900 rpm idle by letting out
&gt;the clutch a tad, the rpm drops, I push the clutch back in or put in
&gt;neutral and it will hold 900 rpms.
&gt;
&gt;5. And finally, just to throw a wrench into this.  Sometimes, maybe 10%
&gt;of the time, Lewis will idle but never do the rpms drop below 2,000
&gt;during shifting.
&gt;
&gt;What the heck is going on here?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
