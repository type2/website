&gt;Listees,

&gt;The install of this 2.0 engine was a work of art!  A Air-box instead of 
early
&gt;injection as we usually use.

Would be nice to find a picture of this one day on the web. What is the 
'Air-box'?
What is the 'early injection', CIS?

&gt; The tech told me that it was hard to get it slowed down!  He said it 
totally
&gt;overpowered the braking system .

The tech should know about the 4-disk brake system.

&gt;  I will be informed as soon as the &quot;KITS&quot; are ready to be sold.  I WILL 
inform
&gt;everyone on the list as soon as I get the word.

Will be nice, we're waiting for more info.
