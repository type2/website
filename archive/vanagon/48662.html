Subject: f/ Technical Discussion Series:  #1


Everyone is invited to partake in the first in a series of technical
discussions concerning the Vanagon.  This first segment will take
place in the well-lit shop facilities (NOT!) on the south shore of
Grace Lake during Labor Day Weekend.  This will be an opportunity
for hands-on experience, a chance to use some test equipment, and git
drive-way time to work on your own vehicle.

Keynote speakers will include:

*Geraldo Skerbitz*
--Fuel Pumps.  Various testing apparatii will be available including 
pressure testers and a fire extinguisher.  Once and for all, Gerry 
will track down and eliminate bubbles in his fuel stream.

--Voltage Regulators.  Gerry will demonstrate dash panel voltage 
regulator removal and replacement.  Several times.  A supply of 
Digi-Key $2.98 10 volt regulators will be on hand as he tracks down 
the cause of frequent regulator failure.

--Vanagon Fuel Odors.  Again, Gerry, standing with a cold beer in
his hand, will instruct Dan on the intricacies of gas tank removal
and replacement as Dan attempts to eliminate fuel odors.  BYOFE
(Bring Your Own Fire Extinguisher)

*Dan Houg*
--Fool Injector Cleaning.  Using a cobbled-up device reminescent of 
R. Goldberg, Dan will instruct participants on injector cleaning 
using pressurized cans of 3M solvent.  This is a unique opportunity 
to observe a wasserboxer running with several fuel hoses disconnected 
and dangling near the exhaust.

--AFM adjustment with O2 sensor.  Provided time and spouses permit, a 
Fluke DMM will be used to set the basic setting on an air flow meter 
tension spring.

--BN4 demonstration.  Acting like a kid with a new toy, Dan will 
demonstrate BN4 operation and commence to start to think about maybe 
installing the BN4 in an '87 Westy someday.

Those wishing to attend this unique opportunity may register and 
reserve a camping spot in 6 acres of horse pasture.  Wipe your feet.
