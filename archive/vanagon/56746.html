Subject: Florida Camping  Info Needed Please!!!!!

	Since I can't make the spring camping trip in Virgina on March 8&amp;9 (I
would have to drive 1100k miles just for the weekend.) I'm spending my
spring break a little farther south. I'm thinking about somewhere around
Pensacola, Fl. Never been there before so I really need suggestions. I'm
looking for a couple of good sites with a lot of cool stuff to do. I'll be
traveling with a big goofy looking dog so I'll need a site that allows her
kind. I'm planning on leaving the ex-Rubber Capital (Akron, OH) on March 14
and hope to make it back by the 23. I will stop to see friends in
Greenville SC and Mobile Al, although I haven't worked that into the plan
as of yet. So if anyone wants to do some camping or chat along the way let
me know. If anyone has camped in this area, please give mr some details.
Thanks all.
