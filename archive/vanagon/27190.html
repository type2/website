Subject: 1980 Vanagon


You may or may not remember the story of the free 1980 Vanagon in
Charleston SC. It was given to me by a friend in June. We went down there
(from Indianapolis) to get it a couple of months ago only to find it was
too big for our trailer. I found a guy there who would put an engine in it
for a grand and then the plan was to drive it home.

We made that trip down to get it over this weekend. The engine was in.
It was supposedly ready for travel. My friend Rich Smith and I drove
down in his Vanagon to get it. We drove off and drove it around town for
awhile to see how it was doing. It was missing out a little and had no
brakes. The right real wheel was smoking. It went back to the repair guy
and he rebuilt the rear wheel cylinders. By this time it had quit
missing out. Some junk in the fuel lines I assume. It had been sitting
for almost 5 years, on an island on the Atlantic Ocean. We took off
again and drove a hundred miles or so to a rest stop in South Carolina
for some shut eye. They have way too many lights in those parks. I don't
have curtains, or even tinted windows. But I managed. The next morning
it wouldn't start. The starter is FUBAR. We pushed it and got it going.
It drove like a champ. I was cruising at around 70 most of the way back.
Rides well, handles well. We made it to about an hour south of
Louisville KY. It crapped out. Figuring it had a clogged fuel filter we
changed it. Sure enough a lot of black flakes and shit came out of the
spent filter. After changing the filter, it started up but wouldn't run
past idle. Pulled the hose from the tank and the gas just trickled out.
Something is clogging up the tank. It has been sitting for a very long
time. Who knows what could be growing in there.

So it rode the last two hundred miles on the back of a tow truck. Gotta
love that AAA Plus!!  So it's home now! Mission accomplished. Now I need
ideas on how to get the tank out, and what the hell to do with it when
it's out. The Bentley manual is pretty vague on the subject. It just says
remove the hoses and remove the tank. Any ideas?

I wanted to put in a plug for the guy that worked on it in Charleston.
It's a beautiful installation job. Everything looks great. He took as
much time to do it right if I had done it myself. If you are ever in the
area and need any VW work done, or just want to chat about them, please
call him. You won't be disappointed. Here's the poop:
