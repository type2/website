     On my Westie all you can do is pull air from inside - its  air
     recirculating system only, there isn't ( doesn't seem to be?) any
     fresh air inlet, and the whole thing is set in the back of the
     vehicle, as far from the windshield as possible.

      I think the non-Westie wasserboxers have a unit mounted up front and
     above, in the same location as the &quot;A/C&quot; on splitties, but I do not
     know if there is a fresh air option, or it is recirculating only, as
     well.

Yes!  I actually keep my apartment at 64 degrees in the summertime!

Suprisingly, A/C also helps to defrost windshields quicker in the
wintertime.  Set it to pull air from inside the car instead of from
outside and your all set!
