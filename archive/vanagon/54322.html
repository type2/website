Subject: E-MAIL ADDRESS CORRECTION
Date: Tue, 14 Jan 97 15:56:13 EST

Hey all,
I made it back to school a little while ago.  The Vanagon performed
flawlessly and got me here in fine &quot;style.&quot;  Saw another Vanagon Westy
while I was getting gas but he left before I could talk to him.  

Anyway, the purpose of this e-mail is to correct the e-mail address I
gave out earlier today.  The correct address to reach me now is
sbart7kb_at_www.mwc_dot_edu .  While the other one (sbart7kb_at_mwc_dot_edu) will
still work, it won't get checked very much at all, so if you've got
something important to send me, don't send it to that address.

Take care,
Sean
