So thorsland_at_bigvax.alfred_dot_edu says:
&gt; look at it but was not able to identify the year.  As I said it is orange.  The
&gt; body is in great shape, no rust, except under the front window which was 
&gt; repaired well.  It has Alabama plates so I guess it missed the rust belt.  It 
&gt; has the pop top that opens from the front and the sink right inside the door.  
It's probably a '75 or '76.  Does it have the slide open middle windows in
the galley area or are they the crank out type?  If it's the sliding type,
it's a '78 or '79.  

Regardless, for that price, it sounds like a great deal.  Go for it!
