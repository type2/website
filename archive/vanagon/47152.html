Subject: 78 Westy questions

I've got a 78 Westy that I have had parked for 2 years.  When it was parked
It was running but would suddenly quit.  When I tried starting it then it
would start but
would not idle at all.  Ok well I have a local VW club that I've contacted
an I'm goning to try and get some help getting it back on the road  but I
thought I would post this question anyway.  What type of things since the
Bus has sat ffor two years should I change or inspect ffor sure during this
revival attempt  ??? It has the 2.0 FI motor
in it.  BTW it has two batteries in the engine compartment I don't have a
manual but I'm guessing that the one on the passenger side is for starting
the Westy and the one onthe drivers side is ffor appliances (IE FFrige) can
anyone give me an idea which is which do I have this guessed correctly ????
Thanks in advance.
