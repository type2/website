&gt;Christopher Bridge quoth:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;now, do any of you happen to know where this company called Sportsmobile
&gt;&gt; &gt;actually is?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't know, but I think I have one of these on my 71 bus.  I mentioned
&gt;&gt; that mine pops straight up and nobody had heard of it.  Anyone have any
&gt;&gt; pic's or something like that?  I really want to get mine on the road to get
&gt;&gt; to a get-together, maybe someone can ID this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I've seen two of these designs at shows (BTW thanx for posting the article,
&gt;Martha!).  One was a canvas affair with two long narrow cots; another was
&gt;a sort of accordionized plastic.  I'll try to get 'em scanned in &amp; put up.
&gt;
&gt;This gives us:
&gt;Westfalia
&gt;Dormobile
&gt;Sportsmobile


This are kind of a grey areas but here goes:

Sundial Campers did coversions on old split window busses, don't know if
they offered a pop top though.

Have seen photocopies of a company manufacturing the Douglas Super Top and
Chimo HighTops (those giant fibreglass things that bolt on to the top of
the bus basically doubles the height of the van)

michael
&gt;anyone know of other poptop vendors and their respective years?  More
&gt;anal-retentive trivia for the FAQ!
&gt;
&gt;BTW saw a ford van with a poptop yesterday.  Cool.  Didn't catch the mfr
&gt;name, tho.
&gt;
&gt;**ANNOUNCE** New Account!  Westy Tent pages will be moving!  Owner tired
&gt;(but appreciative) of slow Freenet machine!  Look for details here!***
