Subject: Steering work, Thanks!


As a new member to the group, I had no idea how many great suggestions and
ideas youall have. After reading allthe input and looking at Muir,HVW and
talking to my local shop guy, I made one of the hardest decisions of my life.
I am letting the shop do the work...This is the first time I have ever left
my bus in the hands of another mechanic. Must be the time pressures of grad
school but somehow I cant justify spending a Saterday under the bus when I
can pay someone who has a lift to do the job.They have the press, reamer and
will guarantee the work. Parts will cost about 100 bucks (swing arm pin and
both tie rods) and labor will be another 100 bucks.  Another bonus is that 
this is a new shop to me and I will get to check out their work on a system
that I can see (as opposed to an engine rebuild which only shows poor work
by manifesting problems later on).  Anyway thanks for all the input, Ill let
you know how the job goes.

                                              Steve
