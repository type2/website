Hey guys,

It's that time of year again and I have to put my Bus up for the winter.  
Up here in Duluth, Mn. Snow flies at the end of Sept.- to mid Oct. until 
around May 1st. 

With my previous buses I didn't do anything to them before I put them 
away, just took the tires off and propped it up.  

This new 73 with a 77' motor and drive train might need something else.

What do you do when you store a Bus for the winter?

any info will be appreciated.



Heres a few things I do for storing my 82' Westy.
1. change oil before I put it away
2. Add product called Sta-bil to gas and store with a full tank. (keeps gas 
fresh)
3. remove battery and keep inside house.
4. I don't put it on blocks, so I just over inflate the tires a little.
5. I park it in a dirt floor barn, so I lay out a tarp to park on because a 
lot of moisture will come up from the ground.
6. Cover the van with a big tarp.
7. Leave a couple windows slghtly cracked for a little air flow.

   These are most of the main things I can think of right now. If anyone can 
share some more thoughts on storing their bus let us know.      Tim
