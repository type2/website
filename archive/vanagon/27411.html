Must share this, even if it's not impressive, sure blew my mind.
Recently round about VA, MD, WV, PA 2 new discount parts chains
have moved in in big ways, AUTOZONE, and ADVANCE, these guys blow
the older places out of the water, I mean to the tune of say $15
for a water pump for my uncles straight 6 Dodge pickup instead
of $40 on average at the previous parts stores.  Anyway Sunday
afternoon I'm doing some work on the parents immaculate '77 and
figure I'll go ahead and change the brake fluid over to Castrol GT/LMA
my personal favorite.  I figure I'll dissasemble all the brakes while
I'm at it, due a general system inspection, etc.  Well get to the rears
and notice the cylinders arre picking up just a tad more dust than they
should, ever so slightly damp, but they look good, so I peel back the
dust seal for a look and to my dismay, ugle gunky rusty water/fluid runs
out, worse on one side than the other.  Everyone 1 bit of advice
CHANGE YOUR DAMN FLUID AT LEAST EVERY 3 OR 4 YEARS, Vw says 2, they
meant it.  I mean this thing was so analy maintainted, at 80k miles
you can pull a valve cover and see metal clean enough to eat off
of but I bet never once was the fluid changed, people just don't
do it.  I learned long ago after buying my Quantum Syncro with
1 bleeder valve broken off, and looking at a $100 rebuilt caliper
that system maintainence is paramount, fortunately I machined out
the bleeder for a larger bleeder screw on the Quantum, but the lesson
stuck.  Now VW while well meaning has this stupid infatuation with those
microscopic bleeder valves, on &quot;quality&quot; american iron where the bleed
screw is 5/16&quot; round, it's hard to mess em up, on a VW with a 4 or 5 mm
screw, even after tapping em 100 times with a soft hammer, if you get
one that still won't budge you could be in for problems.  (On a side
note the PO on the quantum had broken off a hardened easy out extractor
in the valve, FWIW you can drill though a tap or easy out using those
titanium nitride or cobalt coated bits with patience).  Anyway back to
the point of the story, I had hoped simply to luck into a rebuild kit
locally on Sunday before I dissasembled the cylinders, I call Autozone,
no kit, cylinder is $20, got to order, SHIT, call Advance, can order
kit for $8 here tomorrow, but got 4 new cylinders on the shelf for
$13.50 EACH!!!!!.  I figure they are crazy, must be Bug parts whatever,
but hold 2 of em.  Go out and get em, they are perfect, very nice
produced by what I figure to be the current Brazilian OEM supplier
if VW is still making the T2 in Brazil (anybody know?).  As nicely
machined as the origional FAG on the Bus, but the casting is a tad
rougher, stil they are brand new, $13.50 EACH, locally, on a SUNDAY
afternoon at 4:00, made my damn day.  Plus on dissasembly, the old ones
were totally shot, fine toward the center of the cylinder where the
piston had been running but severly rusted toward the ends where the
water collect, particularly on the downhill side of the cylinder.  In
short Advance gets my praise on nearly everything, they have an amazing
stock of parts for late Buses, in stock or available next day.  I worry
for the master cylinder and calipers though, still fluid didn't look
that bad on draining, most of the nasty sediment was in the back, pretty
brown though all round.
