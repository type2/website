			Summary and Data Synthetic Oils
			===============================


Note from editor of this article:
---------------------------------

I collected several articles on synthetic oil which seem to contain
more fact than opinions. 
I went through the trouble to verify some of these facts, and also
added the data for the new Castrol Syntec.

The conclusion is that synthetic engine oils are indeed better than regular
oils, though you may not use your car in such a way to get full benefit
of the oil.
Even a good quality mineral oil changed at regular intervals (around 
3000 miles or 5000 km seems to be the norm) for average use will allow 
most car engines to last well beyond other components' useful lives.

The first article is an excellent detailed technical description on oils,
followed by a couple additional notes derived from another posting.
