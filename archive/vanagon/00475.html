Subject: Re: Vanagon Subwoofer

I know you audiophiles will &quot;cringe,&quot; but Radio Shack makes a small
tube-shaped sub-woofer containing its own amp for about $99.  If
you have limitations on size, budget, etc., it's not bad, and I think
would fit in many places in a Westfalia other larger units would not.
