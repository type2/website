Subject:       Re: news group

&gt; &gt; Ahhh!  I had no idea there would be so much traffic on this mailing list.
&gt; &gt; Is there any interest in switching over to a News group?  Has this already
&gt; &gt; been discussed?  I took yesterday off and had over 150 messages.  
&gt; 
&gt; This threat inevitably comes back up.  No newsgroup.  We like it a 
&gt; mailing list.

Ooops.  Typo.  That was supposed to be _thread_.  Apologies to all 
who were accidentally confused/disconbobulated/decapitated as a 
result of my error.

BTW, whoever has the fire-engine YELLOW breadloaf in SLC, you have 
one BAD UNIT.  Whipped past me, and I was doing 75!!
