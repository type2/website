&gt;don't join one of those, it'l  just fill your mailbox up with tons of
&gt;messages&quot;. Now, who'da thought scuttlebutt would prove true.
&gt;
&gt;My stats. 1995 all email (personal and business) about 600 messages
&gt;1996 Vanagon list alone (3 weeks) well over 600.

        Uhmmm, mebbe try digest form? Instructions found on my web page.
I'll tell you right now that the idea of getting everybody to catagorize
thier messages is doomed from the start. It'll never happen. I use digest
form, I get 1-3 large messages per day, with subjects at the top that I can
scan through. Real easy. Takes me about 5 minutes to scan through all of
it. More depending on how many long posts Bob Hoover made that day...  ;-)

Peace,
