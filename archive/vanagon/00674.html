Subject: RE: Refrigerator Madness

&gt;From: derekdrew_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;The most common cause of the fridge not lighting is stale air left in the
&gt;combustion chamber--usually air that has propane still in it. The little pump
&gt;
&gt;I keep  3 feet length of tubing under the fridge and when it won't start I
&gt;attach this tubing to the drain plug at the lower left corner of the fridge
&gt;door. Then, I suck the air down and out of that drain plug with my mouth
               ^^^^ why not blow the air through ? Better taste, less filling..
I haven't tried this, so am I missing something?

&gt;until the air no longer tastes of propane or smoke.
