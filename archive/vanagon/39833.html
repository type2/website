&gt;&gt;I'll have to fab and weld back in.
&gt;&gt; My plan is to get as much low end torque as I possibly can, so we're
&gt;&gt;talking stroke here right?  How much can you do one of these lovelies?
&gt;
&gt;Find the pieces or buy a 2 liter engine.  It will give more torque and power
&gt;without expensive modifications.  If mor is needed, go the corvair option.

I had a 140hp corvair engine in my buggy, ran great (when it ran)
I think finding someone to work on corvairs is even harder than
finding someone to work on VWs.  Corvairs have some of the same
problems that VWs have, and even more, so I wouldn't throw in
the towel on the type IV yet.  I think Dennis was right about
the 2.0 engine, just trying to find one is going to be tough
because these are the ones the type IV hot rodders want to use.
Different rods, crank and heads than the 1.7 and 1.8.

See ya
