	Mark,
	Oh man, vultures who don't write compression figures down are low,
low, animals. I have been smart enough to not return to such places.

	I can relate good personal experience with Stan Antonio VW down
here in Sunnyvale. Its more than a bit of a hike for you, but I trust
'em, at least as far as I can trust any factory service place. Eg, parts
are going to cost big, but they will stand behind their work. I still count
my change, but they're the best I know locally. My bro. had his wasserboxer
heads done there, and he was happy with it, other than the 2K+ it cost...

	A really great independant shop down here is New Dimensions, but
I think they're just into inline fours. Well, shoot, give 'em a call anyway.
408 980 1691

	Let me know if you come down, I can shuttle you from/to the
Fremont BART station if you want.

	Bill
