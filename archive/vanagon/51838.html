Subject: Westy tent info?

hi all,
I'm sure this one's been covered before,
but a friend ('85) and I ('91) are looking for
info on tents that attach to side, much like the
awnings that roll-up and hitch to rain gutter.

Have only seen pictures of one in use, and was wondering
about cost/availability/effectiveness of a full
tent version (three walls, and floor?...something with
bug screen and full privacy, much like pop top canvas).
Does Catalina make such a version (understand they make
awnings).

Any experiences, company referrals/contact info appreciated x 2!   :)

Jonah
(with '90 syncro westy still for sale... and getting more negotiable.)
