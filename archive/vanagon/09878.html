Subject: Engine stalls

I have taken the last two months trying to get aquainted with my newly
purchased '77 Campervan and it 2ltr, fuel injection engine. After replacing
the heads, cylinders, pistons, rings it runs well but has the persistant
problem from before having this work done. That is the engine starts then
stalls. Usually driving for less than a mile somehow corrects the problem.
I've noticed the stalling is worse AFTER the engine has warmed.

Proding around the fuel injection has not helped much. The air aux. valve
is good (on the ohmmeter) but the vacuum does not drop after warming.

Lately I discovered that the fuel pump runs after turning the key off due
to an apparent short at the double relay (this caused my battery to drain
overnight!) 

The power relay is electrically sound but it seems I need to replace the
double relay to correct the pump relay problem. Could this cause the
stalling? How much and where is a double relay purchased? 

And unrelated...exactly where is the EGR service light cut-off switch. I
figure it must be on the speedo cable but I don't see it.
TIA for any advice.
