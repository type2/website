Subject: Re: Aftermarket Electronic Ignition

&gt;  I'm gathering up the parts to install the rebuilt engine that I will pick
&gt;  up next week. I've ordered carb parts and rebuild kits as well as a new
&gt;  fuel pump from RMMW and I'm thinking about installing one of the &gt;
aftermarket
&gt;  electronic ignition gizmos that replace the points.

Dave,
I have the expensive, but awesome Stinger S4 with a magnetic pick-up.  It's
nice.  I never think about distributors anymore.  I'm not sure anybody
really needs one though.


Eug,
'71
got my 78 x 90.5 running

PS for people interested in exotica, I am now using a high speed exhaust
analyser and it is _way_ cool.  I get an instant readout of rich or lean
mixture, if I had this six or seven engines ago (not all mine) I would have
saved at least a couple of those engines.  It is really helpful, and I think
will enable me to get the most life out of this engine.
