Subject: Mod. of door lock

  Rework of drivers door lock: allows locking of the door without key

  I have make this modification. on 3 locks. 2 of witch are from 1986 
  models, and 1 on a 1980 model. (this may explain why VW did what 
  they did) In the 86's, as you exit the inside, you must unlock 
  the door, to get out. With the 1980 model, after the mod., you can 
  exit, regardless of weather the door is locked or not. This means 
  it's even easier to lock your keys in the car! so:
   
  Step 1 - Make sure you no where your wife is at all times or
           if you don't have that headache, hide a key on the outside
           of the vehicle.

  Step 2 - Remove the door lock: 1 small screw barried in the rubber
           holds the outside handle on, 2 larger screws hold the lock 
           to the door. 2 levers- the inside lock lever, and the
           inside lock handle.

  Step 3 - After removal  clean the old grease and dirt out.
           Now you can see whats going on. At the top/inside you
           will see a lever that pivits on a large rivet with the
           lock in the opened position only. This is also
           the piece that connects to the inside lock lever. This is the 
           part that needs to be modified. Work the lever with the
           lock opened and closed, and note the bent over tab at the 
           very top that stops the inside lock lever from moving, in 
           the opened position. 

  Step 4 - Cut off the tab: This is the hard part. In the 1980 lock I
           have removed this part to made the mod. In the newer style 
           removal seams impossible.  If you have a Dremel
           tool or a die grinder with good bits and alot of time,
           you can make the mod., without removal. Maybe someone
           can find a way to remove the newer style. To get 
           this part out of the older style, you must cut the 
           rivet head out. Cut the rivet head off of the inside with 
           eather a die grinder, a milling machine or a drill. There 
           is a flat washer over the rivet and 2 springs connected to 
           the lever that you must keep track of. It's a puzzle to 
           remove and install, but it can be done. Grind the tab off 
           using a a bench grinder. 

  Step 5 - Install in reverse order! That's what it always saids! The 
           only hard part is what to do about the rivet. The last one 
           I did, I had a  friend, (after fussing with it for about 
           10 minutes) spot weld the washer to the remaining end of 
           the rivet. There maybe another way. If you use a milling  
           machine to remove the head of the rivet, you maybe able to 
           drill and tap the rivet. This would be the best solution.


  Step 6 - After installation grease the lock well. Make sure it works
           and reinstall. Note after the lock is installed on the door
           there was a small amount of silicone seal between the bottom
           of the lock and the door. 

           
                             Have Fun
