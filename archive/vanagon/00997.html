&gt; Well, I know it is a stretch but for the first time in a while I am 
&gt; number one.  Let's hear it for all those with the '71 buses.  Somebody
&gt; run out quick and buy another so we can break the tie with the '73s.

Well does it count that I have a '73 in my backyard rotting away, in 
addition to my '73 camper?  I'm NOT going to buy another one, so 
someone else will have to break the tie.
By the way Jim, what does your bus look like?  This isn't THAT big of 
a town, maybe I've seen you around.

and one of those silly dancing bear stickers in the rear window.
