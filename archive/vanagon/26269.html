Subject: Re: tranny shaft play

    I have done a number of different trannys (Benz, VW, ford, chevy, 
BMW) and there has been lots of end play in the trans shaft in european 
cars, this especially pronounced in automatics from what I remember.  I 
think it compensates for slight variations in the coupling between 
tranny and engine.

&gt;Eric, I have a '71 Westy that I have had the trns and/or engine out 
more
&gt;than several times and i too have a considerable amount of play in the 
main
&gt;shaft of the trans.  while i could'nt tell you if it is normal or not, 
I
&gt;have I guess you could say intentionally ovwerlooked it and have 
indeed put
&gt;many thousands of miles, both far type miles and local type miles and 
have
&gt;had no problems with the bus.
