Subject:  vdo cyl head temp sender

i'm looking for a single wire head temp sensor, anyone know if this
exists, and where i can get it?  when my motor was rebuilt the mechanic
'lost' the sender, i got the spark plug-ring-type 2-wire sender, but he
says i need a single wire one.

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
