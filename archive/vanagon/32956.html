So, I'm at my FLAPS on the way home from work last night to pick up an oil
filter for one of my &quot;other&quot; vehicles.
When I come out of the store a white Westy vanagon is parked beside me. 
&quot;Cool&quot; I think, &quot;Lets have a look&quot;.
The doberman in the passenger seat made me keep my distance (didn't bark,
just intimidating), but I could spy the
usual camper accessories.  As I walk around the bus I see the back hatch is
a different color and there is plastic taped on
where the back glass should be.  &quot;Wait&quot; I think, &quot;Didn't I just exchange
Email with a guy on the vanagon list from here in
Durham who had gone to AZ or somewhere to bring back a vanagon&quot;?!!   &quot;He
bought it without the hatch I think&quot;.
So, I waited.  Seeing a nice looking fellow approachI say &quot;Hey, is this your
van?  I think I know you.
Did we exchange Emai?  My name is Gary Clayton.&quot;  &quot;YES!&quot; he says, &quot;I'm
William Gau&quot;.
So William and I met FTF (Face To Face) for the first time, standing in the
parking lot there and talking for a good 20-30 min.

If William and I can meet this way, think what will happen when we get those
stickers Richard is doing....
Hell, a year from now we will all be living together at a VW commune
somewhere in Arizona or New Mexico.

Peace Ya'll,
-gary
