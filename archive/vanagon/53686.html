Subject: American Quilt and a VW Bus

Just saw American Quilt (on video):

Can't say I enjoyed the movie as much as my girlfriend, but the reward
for me came at the end when an old bus appeared.

I think it was a early 60's barn door splittie with the canvas roof in
the middle of the passenger bay. The end of the movie was a nice tight
shot of two characters in the bus with the barn doors open and then the
camera falls back. A nice vw ending :)
