Subject: Coolant loss over....but for how long?

You may or may not believe this.
After loosing coolant for about three weeks and quite a lot, I added a
sealing liquid containing vegetable fibres and some gluey stuff from
pinetrees to the coolant. It did not work at first, but now after
driving about 600 miles there has been no loss of coolant. Hard to
believe because the leak was likely in the headgasket since water was
left on top of the motorblock on the corner closest to the driver's
seat.
But yesterday there was a strange sound coming from the engine. Like
tick, tick, tick, but louder. (Not as loud as clunk, clunk, clunk). It
came from the right part of the motor and went away after having had a
short stop. Could be just a loose exhaust pipe but maybe it is something
inside the engine, but what? I know this is not much to go by, but if
anyone had similar experiences I'd like to know.
Thanks
