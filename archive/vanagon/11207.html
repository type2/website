Hi gang!

I finally got the engine torn all the way down, and this is what I see:

1) Bent pushrod

2) Two piston rod bearings shot (crank end)

3) The split main bearing seats in both case halves has the bearing numbers
imprinted into them (align bore time!), although I can neither see nor
feel any out of round or mushrooming of the seats.

I'm going to take the crank and cam somewhere to have them checked.  
Hopefully they're OK, and I can get away with just new bearings.
Then I can bring my Bus to the AZ campouts!
