Subject: '81 Westy miss and dash mat

Hi again.  I'm still trying to put my '81 into factory condition.  I have
some stuff coming from the Parts Place.  Are they usually reliable?

Also, the engine has a major miss at high RPM.  It is smooth and runs fine
normally, and on the road it never gets up enough RPM to manifest this
problem, but if I am stopped, in park or neutral, and I rev the engine,
when the RPMs get up high enough, the engine starts to &quot;romp.&quot;  At least
that's what we used to call it.  Kind of wroom...miss...wroom...miss...
etc.  The RPM sounds like it is varying several hundred, while the gas
pedal stays the same.  The book says the computer will prevent over-reving.
 Is that what this is?  I put in new plugs, rotor, and dist. cap.  I have
wires coming.

When I ordered a dash mat for it the book said it fit all but &quot;Wolfsburg
Deluxe.&quot;  I don't think I have one of those, but how would I know?

Thanks in advance.  This list has been a lot of help.  Seems like a great
group of people, and makes me glad I got the Westie, just so I have an
excuse to associate.


Bill
