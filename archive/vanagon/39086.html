Subject: Re: Jalousie windows (cleaning/restoring) 

*Cleaning/Polishing*
Try 0000 steel wool, &quot;Never Dull&quot; batting polish, and Mother's Polish. Start
with the Steel wool rubing along the &quot;grain&quot; of the aluminum. Don't get
rougher steel wool as you will put scratches into the alum. that will be
hard to get out. Triple ought (000) might work if you're gentle.

*Weather Seal (internal)*
Camper supply-RV or Businesses that specialize in &quot;glass&quot; or &quot;windows&quot; in
the phone book will tend to have the black or grey fuzzy weather seal stuff
(very short brush-like fibers woven onto a plastic like backing) that goes
on the inside of the window frames on the vertical edges. It's the same
stuff typically found on screen doors/Arcadia sliding glass doors in homes.

*Weather Seal (external)*
-Grey Seal*
The grey rubber seals on the outside edges of the frame (window to body
seal) is tougher to locate. The closest that I have been able to locate is
what glass shops refer to as &quot;Spline&quot; material. Dimensions as follow:
Channel depth =  9/32&quot;
Metal Opening = 5/32&quot;-3/16&quot;
Have your local glass shop refer to the CR Lawrence catalog , Item #  GC195C.
I caution that I am currently working with a local glass shop on getting
samples of this material prior to buying the 50' roll.  I will report to the
list when I know more.
-Putty Tape*
The correct way to remount the windows includes the use of old fashioned
window sash putty. Typically in camper shells, RVs and our old splittie
buses this putty was used in a &quot;tape&quot; form. Go to your RV supply place and
simply ask for putty tape. It's cheap.

* Side note*
 A friend of mine with a '66 camper went to a camper/RV supply place, showed
them his window and was able to simply buy rubber material that looks
perfect. I went to the exact same shop asked for the same material and acted
as if I was from another planet. They suggested that they have not had the
stuff on the shelf for years and years. The lady was familiar with VW buses
as she had previously owned three of them. Attempts to clarify this
weirdness with the friend and the glass shop have failed.

I hope I have helped.
