Subject: Re: Use of Tow Dolly to Move a Vanagon

&gt;Has anyone had any experience in moving an inoperative Vanagon a couple of
&gt;hundred miles using a Tow Dolly with the rear of the Vanagon mounted on the
&gt;TD axle and the front wheels on the road surface?  The Vanagon is without
&gt;engine, without spare tire and with one rear tire of questionable

I think Jim Kirk tried this and got some whipping side 2 side.  He then put
the rear wheels down instead and had no probs,  I've towed with front wheels
down no problem, not a vanagon, 1700lb Porsche. Why not rear wheels down?
If you are worried about dropping into gear remove the rear axles.
