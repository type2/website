Subject: Club listings on WWW.

     Hi all,
     
     hows about I put a listing of VW clubs on my server ?
     
     I can start with the SSVC (split screen van club), and the T2 Owners 
     club, but what about ones like SOTO and Neato etc.. any 
     representatives of them around ?
     
     Lee.
