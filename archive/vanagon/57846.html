Subject: Poor running when O2 disconnected


Hello again everyone,
	Since returning from Baja my Vanagon, an '86 Westfalia, will not
run with the O2 sensor connected.  It runs fine right when it is started
then the idle delapidates until it stalls.  This may be an outcropping
from a recurring problem that Ive had where the van runs rough and stalls
in the rain or snow.  Waterproofing the O2 sensor wires and connector
solved that problem.  The O2 sensor was replaced just prior to Baja and is
specifically made for VW's...i.e. the wires are not spliced.  When I
disconnect the O2 sensor the van runs great...better than it used to run 
when the sensor was working.  However my gas mileage goes to crap, and it 
wasn't that good to begin with. 
	Anyway, most of the tests that Bentley would have me do require
that I be able to determine my CO content...which I cannot do.  I would
really really rather not pay some fool just because he has a CO
tester unless I have to.  Anyone have any ideas what might cause this?

TIA,

Cory
'86 Westfalia
