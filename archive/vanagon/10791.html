Subject: Re: Oil cooler

&gt;
&gt;Dave Carment and I priced new coolers here in San Diego recently.
&gt;They were $120.  The seals are cheap, if not included.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I presume that the engine must be removed in order to 
&gt;&gt; perform this service.  Correct?  ('74 II)  
&gt;
&gt;Nope, it can be done easily with the engine in the bus.  Just
&gt;remove the fan housing and it is right in front of ya.

Wow...&lt;exhaled sort of slowly&gt;  You mean...  Wow...
I can do this.  I'm glad I asked about this now.  I was
having some nightmare...  I feel better.  Thanks.  --Ralf
