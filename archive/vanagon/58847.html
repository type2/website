Chaz,
NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER suspect the fuel injection system before doing a
THOROUGH diagnostic and replacment session with the ignition system.
Then you can deal with the fuel injection.  

If you want to know if your air flow meter is bad, you can test it.  You
need an ohmmeter and a Bentley manual (or Haynes).  Don't replace FI
parts until you have tested them and are sure that they are bad.  It's
too expensive to jerk around with.  

Now, when you say smoking I assume you mean black smoke because you not
the exhaust smelled like gas.  If this is true, your engine is running
rich.  Typically this is caused (and again, go through the ignition
system first, maybe you're not getting a consistent spark) by a bad head
temperature sensor.  Check the sensor and wiring with an ohmmeter.  The
specs are in Bentley and Haynes.

&gt; On the way home from work today, my 81 westy started running really
&gt; rough and smoking.  The exhaust smelled strongly of gas and died if I
&gt; took my foot off the gas.  I got it home, checked all the connections
&gt; (and looked for broken wires) in the fule injection system with no
&gt; luck.  I then disconnected the air flow meter, and the thing idled
&gt; fine.  Of course, it won't drive like that.  As soon as I reconnected
&gt; the air flow meter, it died.  Has my air flow meter gone bad?  Or does
&gt; anybody have any ideas?
&gt; Its a 2.0 air cooled and a daily driver with 116k.  Any help would be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; Chaz
