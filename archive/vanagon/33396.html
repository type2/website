Subject: need ride to San Diego


Buying my '72 Westy back from David Schwarze, but he lives way down
in San Diego and I live near Santa Cruz. Looking for some help in
getting it up here...either a ride down there or we can take my Honda
and someone can follow the bus in it (I know Martha likes to drive it ;)
No, Travis can't do freeways yet.

This is for this weekend (jan 27/28). Dave will be partying all weekend,
if that's any incentive.

I'll go hunting through the archives to get the original post. Bummer dude.
