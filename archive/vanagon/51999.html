Subject: Re: Aux solenoid/hot start fix article

Before replying to Sean, I have to state that I was brain dead when I 
responded earlier suggesting that the starter amperage would flow 
through the aux relay.  My apologies to the collective mind...

...and now, back to your regularly scheduled mailing list...

&gt; Mine was not even a Bosch relay, it was an auxiliary light relay made by
&gt; NightBlaster or some such for their fog lights.  Rated to 30 amps.  It's
&gt; done well for me, but I must confess I installed it in summer and sold
&gt; the bus a week or so ago, so I don't know how it would do in the dead of
&gt; winter but it did great down to 20 F or so.  Hoover once told me when I
&gt; asked him about this that the draw was around 30 amps.  I think the
&gt; Bosch relay is only fused for 15 amps and I haven't heard of anybody
&gt; having problems.

I don't know about anyone else, but I haven't caught Bob in any falsisms,
er, falsehoods, lies, etc., so I'll probably amend the article to reflect
his observations, while leaving in my observations about the generic Ford
relay. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;From an empirical standpoint, I've had the Ford relay in place for several 
&gt; &gt; years and the system hasn't hiccuped once.  I would think that if the Ford 
&gt; &gt; pulled the same activation current as the starter solenoid that I would 
&gt; &gt; have continued to have problems even after the modification.  Not trying 
&gt; &gt; to be contrary, just my observations.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From what I gather, it's not exactly the same; it's less but it's not a
&gt; whole darn lot less.  The relay is a whole darn lot less :) .  Perhaps
&gt; Bob can give us more specific values to work with because I have no idea
&gt; :) .  The Ford solenoid hasn't given me any trouble but I've only had
&gt; the thing for a few weeks, we'll see how it holds up.  I jsut don't like
&gt; the idea of anything for a Ford on my VW -- Ford does not impress me :)

I know, I know, I felt the same way about it when I installed it.  The 
clinching factor for me though was the fact that the solenoid was going 
in an exposed area by the engine.  The generic Ford is an enclosed steel 
box, while the Bosch, or equivalent, is usually a small plastic box that 
wasn't sealed against the elements.  The generic Ford just seemed better 
designed for harsh environmental conditions.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think we'll have to see whose solution is best over time.  For now, as
&gt; &gt; long as the system's functional I'd leave it in place.  My philosophy is
&gt; &gt; if it ain't broke, don't fix it...;)  YMMV, though, of course. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I'd say you're right.  It's too cold to mess with it now anyway :)
&gt; 

I hear that.
