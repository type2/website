Subject: Syncro can o' worms???

   Just got a diagnostic done on a non westie syncro.  Needs head gaskets,
 trans rebuild, and possibly a front diff.  Maybe even a viscous coupling,
 ouch.  Makes a loud wheel bearing type noise and increases when braking.
 Also sounds like very noisy gears at about 55mph 2800rpm accelerating
decelerating and in neutral coasting.  The seller didn't want me pulling the
plug to check for metal.  Noise is definitely coming from the front.  VC had
fluid dripping off it where it mates to the trans ( if my part geography is
correct).  My un-syncro-educated-guess is that it needs front wheel bearings
and a front diff.  Owner says that the VC is working because the front tires
scrub in very tight turns??  Anyone had a front diff or VC go bad.  What did
sound like how did it behave? Cost of a front diff? rebuild? 

                                Thanks much, Pete
