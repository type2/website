To All:

I'm not a car painter, although I've painted quite a few cars.  Lots of
airplanes, too.  My interest in applying paint is to preserve and protect the
vehicle.  Its finished appearance runs a distant second although when
properly applied my work doesn't look all that different from what you'll see
in a new-car show-room.

A good paint job by a professional car painter costs several thousand
dollars.  His only interest is in making it look good, which he does.  The
typical pro can win prizes.  But he only uses paint that contributes toward
the 'appearance-goal,'  if you want two-part epoxy primer, and nine coats in
the wheel wells and different colored primers for different parts of the car,
the pro will do it... for a price.

The cost of a good paint job is enough to justify buying a low-pressure,
high-volume gun and tackling the job yourself.  LPHV isn't nearly as
difficult to learn as the older method and actually does a better job in less
time, plus you can always sell the equipment when you're done and recover
part of the expense.  The real problem is finding a place to do the painting.

HVLP systems (works either way :-) have very little over-spray, almost
everything that comes out of the gun ends up on the vehicle.  You can do a
fair job even without a spray booth, assuming no wind, few bugs and warm
weather.  If you don't have those conditions but do have the space, a
one-time spray booth made of plastic sheeting is a practical alternative.
 Just make sure it doesn't collapse onto your freshly painted vehicle.

The real secret of a nice paint job is the preparation, and to do a really
good job you must strip the vehicle of all doors, windows, hatches and hood.
 You should expect the vehicle to be in this state for three or four days,
long enough to shoot, cure and sand several coats of primer.  The final
finish will reflect every error and omission but it will also reflect the
several hours of sanding needed to flat the primer coats..

The nicest thing about doing your own painting is that you know the finished
product won't rust.  That assumes you've eliminated any existing rust and
then used several coats of two-part epoxy primer, the first coat being the
type with the anti-corrosion stuff in it.  Oddly enough, such a paint job has
the ability to look better over time.  Just make sure the color coat is heavy
enought to withstand being rubbed out.

Such a paint job will never win any prizes but with freshly painted wheels,
new window rubber and re-installation of well-polished chrome fittings, the
results aren't half bad, certainly better than you'll get at one of the
quickie paint shops.  Plus you have the security of knowing the belly got
more than its share of primer; that the rust was dealt with and that the
final shape isn't the result of a hundred pounds of bondo and a mile of
fiberglas.
