Subject: The TRIP, Test &amp; Stuff!!

for Gerry Skerbitz:

Got your response, to my response .... etc.

After I had sent the messages to you, I got the LIST mail and saw the
apology in the digest.

Based on all the &quot;OTHER&quot; mail I received as a result of complaining
about getting junk mail, I guess I'm in the minority (snik) ;(

I have no regrets about voicing my opinion and don't feel warm toward
others &quot;telling&quot; me of the beneifits of getting junk mail.
I posted my complaint to the LIST hoping to find &quot;life&quot; out there in the
form of others who may have been willing to take stand against even
sutble abuse(s) and potential denigration of the quality of what we have
experienced on this list. I WAS SADLY MISTAKEN!!

I've opted not respond, individually, to the other mail but will defend
my right to reject what I don't want to see!

I'm contemplating leaving the list since I may not be in the company I
expected.

As far as I am concerned, this is the end of the chapter!

Sorry about you leaving the position. I can readily understand the
burdens that function requires and hope you will move to better and
&quot;higher ground.&quot;

THANKS FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE!!!!!!!!!!!

All things considered, I have seriousl doubts that this would have been
started if you had not garnered the determination, energy and
dedication!!
===================================================

With respect to the &quot;CIRCLE THE GREAT LAKES TOUR&quot; ....

It's still a go, as far as I am concerned!

I've been doing research and had requested literature about
dates/places/things-to-do along the proposed route(s). I received SOME
information, but a very poor percentage of return based on the
information queries I sent. I'm gonna &quot;wing-It' from hear!!

As of this moment, I'm closing final exams and after submitting grades,
I'll have time to clear and finalize the proposed trip!

I have a list of names/addresses to whom I will, individually, respond
rather than pollute the list. I'll place a generalized note on the list
about the progress of the trip.

I'm considering taking both &quot;The CONESTOGA&quot; and &quot;Pete's Play THING&quot;,
in-tow; that should equalize my potential speed to some of the older
vehicles. (two other THING owners have voiced 'consideration' about the
TRIP also). This is &quot;just thinking&quot; at the moment.

I'm hoping to get this settled or at least the initial phase of
	&quot;thinking that I can think that I may be close to settlement&quot;
by the second week in March. ;)

Give my regards to Loren and the boys! Hope to see you sometime this
summer.

Regards,
--
