&gt;Do the plastic (that used to look like chrome) strips that are inlayed in
&gt;the window seals on my '85 Vanagon serve any useful purpose?  They have
&gt;discolored and look kind of nasty now and I'd like to just take them out.

Nope, thems just thar to look purty.  You will have a gap for a while, until
the rubber shrinks back down and fills it.  It won't leak though.
