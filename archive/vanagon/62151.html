Tim,

In case no one's gotten back to you yet (on this list you've probably had a 
bunch of replies - good group)

The '87 A/C actually has two pressure switches in the high-pressure freon 
line. These are located behind the left rear pillar-cover on a metal length of 
the hose.

The high pressure switch jumps the radiator fan to mid-speed if the freon 
pressure gets too high. This doesn't sound like your problem.

The low pressure switch keeps the compressor from running if the freon is lost 
or if the ambient temperature is too low. Hmmm... that doesn't really sound 
like your problem either - but the switches are easy to get at and test with a 
VOM.

Perhaps you have an A/C relay problem. These things are sometimes 
temperature-sensitive due to the contact alignment. I've had one that would 
let the system work OK inthe morning when the temperature was cool, then the 
A/C wouldn't run on hot days after sitting in the Texas sun.

The relay is also in the left rear pillar, and is easy to get at. Last I 
recall the dealer wanted about $75 for one - so this isn't a try-it-and-see 
for most of us.

Anyone know another source for these - maybe Ron at Bus Depot?
