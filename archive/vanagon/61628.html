&gt; Removing the float assembly, and leaving it connected to the wiring

&gt; the various levels correctly, and then sometimes stick on green.
&gt; I've played with the wires, and everything is tight, and clean.

Our '86 Sycro Westy (Canada specs) does not have a float mechanism (that
I can find). Instead there are four (or is it three?) electrical
contacts on the side (through from the outside) of the water tank. When
the water level is such that two contacts are covered, the circuit is
complete and the sensor light is lit.
