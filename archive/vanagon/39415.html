Subject: Re: Care and feeding of pilot bearings

Hi Steve,
  I replaced mine when I did my last clutch. I have an 1800cc type 4, but I
guess it's roughly the same.

&gt; BTW, is the pilot bearing a real tight press fit
&gt; into the flywheel

...yes it is. You will probably need a small bearing puller. I actually
broke down and got one from JCWhitney's. It's actually called &quot;pilot bearing
puller&quot;...

&gt;
&gt; Last but not least, where exactly does the pilot bearing mount on a
&gt; normal '80 Vanagon? One person told me it's in a hole in the end of the
&gt; crankshaft, and another has said that it's in a hole in the flywheel.
&gt; Being a type-4 ignoramous myself, I have no way of knowing, until I
&gt; drop the relevant part on my foot. Anyone know for sure?
&gt;
...don't woory 'bout that, you'll see it right away once you're in there.
And I would always replace both front engine seal and flywheel o-ring while
you're in there. And check end play just for fun (see archives about
that)...&gt;
  Later,
            G.
