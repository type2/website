I have the second oil cooler set up with a fan but it is not vented into
the car as of now. It would not be that difficult to vent the flow of air
into the van. A flap could be set to block the flow of oil in the summer
and opened in the winter. To achieve the right opertaing temperature a
thermostat could be set up so to limit the flow to the second cooler
until peak operating temps are reached.  I am unsure about whether the
oil is cooled too much, this does  not appear to be the case in the
summer. A key thing which could be used to one's advantage is where the
air that flows over the cooler comes from. Underneath the car would be
unhealthy, better would be to have the air recirculated from inside the
van. This would serve two purposes: ensure good air and lead to hotter
op. temps (for the cabin and the oil).  --
