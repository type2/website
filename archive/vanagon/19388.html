  Well, yesterday someone decided to give my happy, peaceful,
brightly-hued 67 an extra stripe with their key yesterday. The nice
person graciously made sure the stripe went All the way down the side,
and was very deep as well. Just curious as to if any other busses,
especially the more colorful ones, have ever been, er, shall we say
&quot;modified&quot; by the less than adoring public?
Anyway, I hope not...
Richard
