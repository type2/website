Subject: Oil filter cooler hoses

Has anyone ever replaced either of the hoses that connect to the oil filter
cooler? Can this been done without pulling the exhaust pipes (the bolts on
mine are solid pieces of iron oxide)? It may prove necessary to remove the
oil filter to get at them. Is there any &quot;easy&quot; way of preventing the oil
filter screw on plate from getting drenched in whatever coolant is hanging
around in those hoses? I found I could not pinch the spring clamps after
draining the cooling system over the weekend (at least with the exhaust pipes
and the oil filter still on), any suggestions? Thanks in advance...
