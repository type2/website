Subject: capacitor fix?

        Hi All! I've read a few posts regarding a capacitor fix for AFM,
but I haven't seen any info for a L-tronic injection system. I've checked
the archives and  VW Guru Mr. Hoover sermons but haven't seen any info
regarding a 80 Vanagon.
         So the question is-can I apply the same type of fix to my AFM 80
vanagon, Calif emission stuff, I believe the system is called L-tronic
injector system.
        Also I've read conflicting opinons as to polarity- is it (+) on #2
and (-) on#4 wire or is it the reverse? The capacitor I'm using is a 25
volt 22 microfarad tantalum capacitor, is this correct?

Thanks, Rudy B. Santa Rosa, CA
