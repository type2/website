Subject: Parents are cool!

Hey,
	Just a great story to share that happened to me over the weekend. 
Over my Christmas break I started pricing VW vans hoping to find one but 
I had no luck and had to go back to school. Within the last two weeks, I 
found out about this list and have been reading the posts getting excited 
about all of the for sale notices. I finally found on with the help of 
Sean Bartnik that was for sale in Va for a reasonable price. 
	I talked to my father this weekend, he was visiting from NH, and 
told him that I had found a van that I was interested in. He looked a bit 
uncomfortable, and said that he wanted to call my mom and have me talk to 
her about it. Well, it turns out that since February, there has been a 
1987 Vanagon Weekender in the driveway that was supposed to be a big 
surprise for me when I got home in May. I couldn't believe it. You got to 
love great parents. I'm now a proud owner! Looking forward to driving it 
for the first time in 30 days :)
