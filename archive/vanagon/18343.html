&gt; Well folks,
&gt; 
&gt; The new AFM did not help my running rich problem. Next step is
&gt; replacing the ECU. I have found one used for $250. Depending on where I
&gt; shop I could have gotten a new/rebuilt one for between $300-$600. But
&gt; this way I have one to take apart and study.
&gt; 

I've been watching this thread with interest for a while now since my 81 
has the same problem.  I also have an AFM that I don't need, but in 
talking to one of the Robert Bosch service people he recommended that I 
look at the AFM grounds since that seems to be the problem source when 
these units run rich.  

Since Colorado has moved to Oregon for the last month I haven't been 
motivated to work out in the wet and nasty much but I'm hoping to this 
weekend.  One other thing the tech guy mentioned is to check the ground 
live, meaning with current applied since some of these ground problems 
won't show up on a DVM.

Something else to try anyway since my emissions test is due and the cost 
of a waiver just went up.  I'll let you know how I fare.

Jack
