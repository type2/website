Subject: Re: Syncro Fan!!!

 The fan is a
&gt;2 speed fan, so we put a 3 pole switch in so we can control what speed we
&gt;want. I didn' know the fan has a high speed until I installed this switch.
&gt;It only came on on low speed when it came on automaticly. It still comes on
&gt;automaticly but now I have the option of turning it on when I want(need) to.

   Thanks for the info.  I have noticed my fan doe'snt come on untill the
temp gets fairly high.  Bentley shows two switches for the fan on the '86
and newer vans on comes on at 192degF and the other comes on at 203degF.
Has anyone else had problems with the cooling fan not working on the first
switch?
     As an added note, my cooling fan motor has what appear to be hose
fittings on the back of it.  It is larger than the fan motor pictured in the
Bentley.  Is it some kind of booster pump for the cooling system?
