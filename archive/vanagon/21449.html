James: about the generator portion of your message....
check at your local pick and pull (junk) yard for a generator (~$15). 
Bring that to an auto-electric shop and have them replace bearings and
general maintainence... Alot cheapr than buying from suppliers I'd think.
It was my understanding that the generator can take alot more heat than 
an alternator and is therefore IMHO more suitable for the air-cooled van
situation..
