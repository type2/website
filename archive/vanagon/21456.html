Well... I don't have another weekend day free until August 19.  But my 
Wednesdays are free just about anytime.

&gt; 	The possible activities included Beer Drinking, Mountain Biking,
&gt; Old Sacramento, and a tour of Fitzpatrick's Body Shop.

I'll take options 1, 3, and 4.  It's not that I don't like biking, but 
not when I'm drinking and eating.

&gt; 	So!  Lets have a final vote:  Who wantsa come, which weekend,
&gt; which day, and what activities. 

I'm free the last 2 weekends in August, or most any Wednesdays.  If it's 
held any other day.... I'll have to try and rearrange stuff.
