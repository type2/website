Subject: Re: Vanagon Side step



&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;    I was wondering, is there a side step for a Vanagon like they have for
&gt; the Bubble window buses?   I've been racking my brain to remember if I've
&gt; ever seen one.  If they did, does anyone have one they would like to sell?


I made the mistake of buying one that was for a Breadloaf. It was 
about 4&quot; too short. I was going to re-weld the steel bar that fits in 
the jack holes but the unit too rusted underneath. A friend found an 
old alum. bleacher bench for me, and I am going to design a side step/running 
board to slide in the jack points with it. If it works I'll post the 
results.
BTW I saw a Vanagon Westy with a retrofitted side-step and it looked 
pretty bad.
