Subject: plan ahead for trip...


Those of you planning on the tour, might want to be thinking ahead about these 
items, which I'll also include in my upcoming list of things to bring, but 
these bear some thought ahead of time:

autoclub card
maps and guidebooks
health insurance card
car insurance verification
birth certificate or passport may be required to cross border
list of authorized VW dealers
learn CPR?
remember that it is illegal to carry firearms across country boundaries
