&lt;&lt; I own a '81 Vanagon, 1600 cc diesel. We have dubbed it the Volkswagen XLA
 (eXtremely Lazy Automobile).  Since the car is in excelent condition
 bodywise (it is really very pretty, fire-engine red) I would like to keep
 it. However, every day I hope that when I wake up in the morning  I find =
 a
 turbo under the hood.
 
 No kidding, any of you know if it is possible to retrofit a turbo to the
 standard engine. Is it feasible or total nonsens and should I start looki=
 ng
 for another vehicle instead.

 (BTW, are fire-engines red in the US of A? I mean the old style red that
 you would find on fire engines in England and Europe in the fifties. Now
 they are more of a fluorescant orange).

hello, Jan, you could put a 4 cyl Jetta or 5 cyl Quantum (Passat, to you
guys) turbo diesel under the rear deck of your Extermely Lazy Auto..  :&lt;)
or you could go to a gas engine, and install a GTI 16 valve under there, or
do what they do in South Africa, and run a 5cyl audi gas (maybe even a turbo
5 cyl).....
and yes, most fire engines here in the US are red, but I've seen some
flourescent yellow ones too..  :&lt;)
