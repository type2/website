Subject: Oh no! Not another electrical ?

This funny thing happened to me a few months back when I had a stereo 
(rather decent one at that, but not that great...) installed in my beauty 
on wheels. For some reason, when I turn on my lights, the instruments 
lights do not light up. I am assuming that this has something to do with 
the installation, but have paid no heed untill recently when I was 
thinking about it. Shame on me, I know, going about my merry ways 
thinking again. Really I try not to, too often...
The point is, is my problem with the instrument lights related to the 
stereo instalation, maybe something common that installers do that make 
it so I have to tell my speed at night by the beautiful rumble of my 
van's engine/gear I'm in (which is not too difficult as most of you know) ?
Any help in this is greatly appreciated.

-Jason
