Subject: Re: Water under back seat

&gt;Thanks everyone for you help with my propane tank problem and sticky 
&gt;locks.  Now another..  I have water under my back seat ('85 Westy&quot;)&amp; 
&gt;can't figure out where it's coming from. We recently replaced all the 
&gt;roof seals (Bus Boys-great seals!) I'm sure it's not coming from there.  
&gt;There is just a little in each channel along the sides. Any thoughts?

Are you sleeping in the van at night? Could the water be condensation?
