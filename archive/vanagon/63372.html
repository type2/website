 &gt; &gt;Hello,

 &gt; &gt;    I have found a nice 87 which I might purchase, but it has an automatic

 &gt; &gt;automatic tranny ?
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt;    As usual, thanks in advance for your help (you folks have been quite
 &gt; &gt;helpful so far with information, and I appreciate it !)

 &gt; James,
 &gt;
 &gt; I have a 90 Multivan with auto, I get about 3-4mpg less that some with a
 &gt; manual trans, otherwise I'm happy with it.  Performance with a manual is
 &gt; probably slighly better but were not talking racing car here.  Overall I
 &gt; have no real preference and if I had a choice I would pick the van that is
 &gt; in the best overall shape.

Tim,

        Thanks for your response and opinion.  I've since found a 90 Vanagon
with 10K on a rebuilt engine for $4,000 (great deal don't you think ?) which
has a manual, so it looks like that's what I'll probably go with.
