Subject: Should 1982 bus steer straight?
Date: Wed, 16 Oct 1996 22:45:34 +0100

1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:

Is it normal for the steering to drift slightly to the left when coasting
or driving on a flat road? Someone said all busses pull to the left - can
this be true? If not what would be the most likely cause? In case it is
relevant the suspension at the front of the bus is a bit lower than the
rear - is this normal?
