Subject: 1980 Vanagon for Sale - $1000 : TX

Hey all,

I ran into a guy as I was leaving school today who
saw my '79 camper and told me about his '80 vanagon
that he's selling...  I went to take a look, so the 
following information is from a casual lookover and
what he told me...all disclaimers apply and contact
him by phone if you're interested...the vehicle is
in Bryan, Texas...

The good...$1000.00

Creme 1980 Vanagon Westfalia - manual transmission

90,000 miles

Interior is in excellent shape and all of the
camping gear (stove, fridge, sink) is present
and in excellent condition.  Some rips in the 
driver's chair but other than that the inside
is really nice.  

Exterior is in great shape...virtually no rust...a
very small streak of surface rust in right rear panel.
Other than that the exterior is in good shape except
for a flat tire.

The not so good (or &quot;for the more mechanically inclined&quot;)...

One of the heads is cracked, but according to the owner
the engine ran fine otherwise before it cracked. 

I had been coveting this camper (I drive by it every
day) before I got my '79 camper and if I had known it was
for sale for so cheap I would probably be the owner
right now!  Anyway, if you're interested call him...
