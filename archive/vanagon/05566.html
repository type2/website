We made an awesome find on our last trip.  We found that most county 
seats in the midwest have a county fairgrounds, and if it's not fair 
time, there's a campground nearby that's either cheap or free.  This 
works really well for kids too, because the local swimming pool was often 
nearby and the parks were extremely well kept and not over used.
