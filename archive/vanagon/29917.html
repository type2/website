Subject: Re[2]: Engine transplant ideas??

     Subarus have always intrigued me as well.  I see a lot of them in the 
     Sierras during the winter especially since most of them have 4wd.
     
     But, during all of the discussion about engine swaps the boxer 4 came to 
     mind.  It is watercooled(the later ones) I believe and lightweight, seems 
     like the obvious choice when replacing a watercooled vanagon engine.
     
     Any feedback? Does anyone know of conversion kits or horror stories?
     
     Pat S.

&gt;The flat ones of course are ideal for an easy fit, but other than Porsche &amp; 
&gt;VW, there's only Subaru.  Subaru has both flat 4s and flat 6es.  Their newest 
&gt;4cyl is 2.5 liters and makes about 155HP.  I know, I know, it's not VW/Audi. 
&gt; It's not German. It's not even European or American!  But, all thing 
&gt;considered it might be the best alternative.  I think Syncros should be able 
&gt;to live with 155HP.
     
My wife drives a Subaru (Impreza) and I have been kind of charmed by 
 the little beast.  I have often looked at the 1.8L 110 hp motor and 
 visualized putting it in a bus but never pursued it any farther.  Even 
 though Subarus are japanese they are odd enough to almost be a 
 northern europeon car, unusual features push them out of the 
 mainstream econobox market. I understand that mid to late eighties 
 subarus have a problem with there fuel injection and electrical 
 components but the motors are fairly tough. I would love to see more 
 info on this transplant
