You mean the one up under the pedals?  The PO of my Bus installed a
non-automotive squirrel cage fan under there, and interfaced it to
the tube with an aluminum pie tin (you know, the kind you get with
a frozen pie?).  It works pretty well, actually, and makes for great
conversation!  Actually, it worked well when I lived in the sub-tropics;
it doesn't do much in the sub-alpine of Northern AZ!
