Subject: Got my licens plates


i finally got the plates for my 60 crew cab project yesterday.  they are
56 plates that read &quot;VLK 385&quot;.  i picked them up because of the VLK parts.
what better on a VW.  anyway, i had them fully restored.  straightend and
painted back to original.  wow, what a difference.  the yellow and black
really stand out and they look great on the truck.  old plates really add
to the look of a vintage restored vehicle.  can't waight to show her off
at the upcomming shows.

take care and God bless
matt
