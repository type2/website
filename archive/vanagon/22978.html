&gt; reading. But I could be wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any comments on these gadgets? Let 'em rip!

    One came in the clock well for the '76 Campmobile, says
    VDO, hope it's accurate, it's hot here and I keep an eye
    on what I'm assuming is an accurate temperature. It fits
    into the oil drain plate and has a LOOSE WIRE running the
    length to the dashboard. I hope it's accurate, I haven't
    had a meltdown yet... wouldn't leave home without a working
    oil temperature gauge... now to install a tachometer, ammeter,
    cylinder head temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge...
