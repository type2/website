]I was wondering if there was a mailing list for BMW 2002 autos or BMW motorocylcles.  If there is one, can someone pleaselet me know if you havew heard of these lists?

It moved a couple of months ago and I don't have the address, but there is 
a very active BMW motorcycle list that was started by Joe Senner.  Write
Joe at joe_at_mpd.tandem_dot_com or senner_joe_at_tandem_dot_com and see what the current
signup procedure is.  There is also a separate list that is only for BMW
boxers that I could get you signup info for if that's your interest.

(Yes, I'm way behind.  I was out for a couple of months.)
