So Harvey Chao says:
&gt; 
&gt; Not seen:  Antonio VW in Sunnyvale has always had at least 3 -5 Vanagons on
&gt; their used vehicle lot for sale.  Some were Westfalias, others plain vans,
&gt; some Vanagons, and some older &quot;loaf&quot; types.  When I had clutch problems a few
&gt; weeks ago they had none on their lot, and when I went by today still had none.
&gt;  Are Vanagons etc. becoming scarce critters??

I haven't seen very many VWs (in general) forsale at all in the local 
Sacramento Bee.  Must be the holidays.  I guess people assume that nobody's 
interested this time of year.

Cheers!
