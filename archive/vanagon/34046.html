&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 	Check out the Jerque du Jour page today 1/29.
&gt; 	http://www.got_dot_net/~egallant/the_road.html to see this one.  It
&gt; 	has a picture of a Vanagon Westy passing a Jeep Cherokee and the
&gt; 	guy says: hint, if you're being passed by a VW camper, you're
&gt; 	not going fast enough.  Is that true or what? :) :) .  Anyway,
&gt; 	the jerk was the Jeep, not the VW.  Apparently, the Jeep was
&gt; 	hogging the left lane for a while while going very slooooooowly.
&gt; 	This is a great page and that looks like a nice Westy....
&gt; 
&gt; 	Sean
