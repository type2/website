Subject: Re: Extra Storage Space


&gt;I solved a problem and thought I's share it:
&gt;
&gt;On the sliding door side of my Westy, there is a space underneath about
&gt;48=22 long, 14=22 wide and 4=22 deep.  This is the same space used for the=

&gt;propane tank on the other side of the van. Well at our local W**l M**t,
&gt;they sell a plastic gun case for =24Cdn 17.48 (=7E=24US 13) and it measure=
s
&gt;48=22 long, 12=22wide and 4=22 deep. EUREKA. Two custom made brackets and =
a
&gt;shock cord and the deed is done.  Now my jack, air pump, towing rope,
&gt;hand buck saw and hatchet now longer use up space under the back seat.
&gt;
&gt;Can you think of a better use for a gun case?

I'm using this place for a 40 L water tank, 60L also available. It is
used as a sewage tank and it gives me no problems using the sink
in town. This tanks are special made for Vanagons and will need no
special brackets, only four bolts going through the floor. The price for
this tank is around 70 USD, a little bit more than a gun case.

In opposite side, where are the propane tank of the Westies, I have the
same tank as a reservoir for clean water. Of cause, the water in this
tanks will freeze during wintertimes if you don't use the Trakka version
of a coolant heated water boiler.

My father is going to built a special case which will find its place
between the left frame rail and the shift rod. He like to saw a hole
into his floor to get access to his cellar from inside the Van. It is
not finished yet and I will send more on this if someone is interested.
