Subject:       Porche Fuche Alloys

Can anyone tell me if you can polish the whole of the fuche rim??
I've just bought some (5!!!) and the inserts are painted Pink!! - I'm 
wondering can I get them shot blasted and then polish the whole rim 
as I've heard varying stories...
Can anyone put me straight??? Cheers
