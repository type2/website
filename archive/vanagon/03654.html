Subject: Re: Fukengruven

I just called and they have neither the sticker nor another that I saw on 
the front of a split I saw when I was traversing 101 in CA 5 years ago 
which consisted of a ~14&quot; &quot;eat your face&quot; with the lightning bolt removed 
from the skull and a vw logo inserted.  Any other suggestions?


BTW, on another and non-vw subject let me get on a soap box about
bone-marrow donation.  The proximate cause is that I just got a call from
the donor program and am now (1:4 chance) in line to be there first double
donor.  The last was a 34-year old with leukemia, who is after 15 months
alive and well in Indianna, this one is a 13-year old.  The registration
process is easy and painless (well, it is a needle, but near painless and
only 10cc of blood), and commits you to nothing.  The donation process is 
a bit of a bear, but still nothing compared to dying of cancer.  If 
anyone wants info, let me know and I will try to get you a local contact, 
or try your local red cross.  OK, down off the soap box, and thanks.

&gt; &gt; You should call 800-225-3323, or write to Grtaful Dead Merchantile Co.,
&gt; &gt; P.O. Box X, Navado, CA 94948.  They should have what you want.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Navado is actually Novato.
