Subject: Re: Blowing Coolant Hoses Right and Left (VW Service)

&gt; So Drew Jenkins says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It burns me because I specifically mentioned to the service manager that
&gt; &gt; I saw coolent leaking from this part.  This is the first and last time 
&gt; &gt; this dealer will ever do any work on my vanagon.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Talk about frustrating!
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, and I don't think VW is listening very well.  I get phone calls and
&gt; post cards from them asking how I liked the recent service I had.  I write
&gt; exactly how I feel and they apparently don't listen.  But they keep sending
&gt; flyers on their new cars thinking I'm going to buy something else from
&gt; them????  :[ !!!

Yep too! VW-service sucks and VWoA is building pieces of shit these days, the newer they get, the shitter they are! What happened to the good old VW's (like those 2,000,000 miles bugs ?). I'll never buy
a VW again... at least not new.

Have you driven a FORD lately?
