&gt; Hello-
&gt;
&gt; Upon starting my '87 Syncro it immediately stalls.  I have to give it a
&gt; little gas for 2-3 min. before it idles smooth.  When warm, it has no
&gt; trouble idling at 1000 rpm.  Any suggestions on the cause/fix to this
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; Background:     187K+, entire exhaust just replaced, coolant leak from
&gt;                 stripped head bolt.

Dave,
Check for the proper function of your engine temperature sensor II.
This device provides  the ECU with the basic information required for it
to further determine whether cold start enrichment/modified timing map
and/or idle air bypass is required to keep your engine running.  If this
sensor is working as intended, check your idle stabilizer and its
related control unit.  Based on your description, I would suspect that
your problem is with the temp sensor.
