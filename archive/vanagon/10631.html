&gt;Anybody know an inexpensive way to get a second-opinion about the quality/need
&gt;of alignment?

nope. at least, i don't know of any cheap way, other than actually having it
done. my experience has been that some brands of tires will SET themselves on
a bad alignment, and then once you get the alignment fixed, the tires will NOT
be fixed ... i.e., they keep on wearing as if the alignment wasn't fixed.
one particular brand was Continental. but that was long ago and far away... :)

&gt;My experience with dealers (my original purchase source AND on-the-road
&gt;referrals) allow me to believe that 'luck-of-the-draw' predominates. ...

yup. that's about it. and, as the Extended Use Report shows, Road &amp; Track
folks were no better served by the Probability Factor (of getting a good
dealer/mechanic) than the rest of us. why didn't their dealer catch the
water pump?

now, me personally, i think we bus owners suffer from lack-of-interest by the
dealers ... that is, they don't sell enough buses to be concerned with the
training of any mechanics to fix them. especially since many mechanics flit
from one job to another, so why waste money training someone who probably
won't be here next year? and the lack of bus customers tends to make the
learning curve for any stay-put mechanics rather looooong. which also tends
to make buses less profitable to work on ... if a mechanic can't fix it quick,
he (and the dealer) are losing money. rabbits and jettas and golfs and such
are plentifully sold, and so much more in quantity for service/repairs ... so
you see more of them, you learn on them quicker, you fix them quicker, and you
make more money.

but that does seem a bit strange to me, as i consider the buses and vanagons
easy to work on. don't know about the eurovan (it might be a lot easier than
it looks to me). :)

&gt;could avoid or decrease in other ways, I'm comfortable (at peace) with the
&gt;arrangement; the dealer 'knows' my vehicle. In circumstances where a

this is also a factor: ANY service organization with any sense will treat
repeat-customers with courtesy and fairness and maybe just a hint of special
favoritism ... whether it's a restaurant or gas station or car dealer service
or parts dept.  but, sadly, this is not always the case. not just for car
dealers, but it does seem more pronounced with them ... maybe it's the amount
of money we 'lose' every time we go there. :(  point being that if you find a
good dealer ('good' being by YOUR definitions), you should try (IMHO) to keep
him/her/them in business by taking your business there. remember this: if they
all go out of business, we are in a lot of trouble, folks!

problem is: it costs a lot of time and money to FIND that 'good' dealer, if
they exist in your area. in my own local backyard, i've been to all the
dealers within 100 miles: zippo. nada. crooks. incompetents. the one i go to
is 200 miles away. so that makes oil changes a non-dealer item. :) and any
emergency repairs are gonna be a bitch. :(

ing what I know NOW ... if I had the opportunity to
&gt;purchase this Eurovan all over again, I'd still do it!!!

good. :) that's the spirit! :) don't forget: ALL vw buses have been thought
to be 'funny-looking' by the vast majority of 'others' out there in autodom.
well, they can just kiss my grits, and my possum's grits!

besides ... if i had a ferrari or porsche, i'd be in lots worse shape for
'decent' dealers around these parts! or even a mercedes ... you'd think that
with the new Mercedes G-Wagen-type-car factory going up about 12 miles from
here that the local Buick-Mercedes (oh, yeah. figure THAT one out!) would
be concerned with 'shaping up', but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

well, anyway. them's my caffeine-less comments. now, back to sleep.
