Sound like a lot of money to me.

&gt;  		Porta-Potty:  $125   (Is this necessary?  It seems like a 
&gt;  					big space waster to me)

Depends on where you camp.  It might be vital.  :-)

&gt;  		Pop top:  $3250

If you want to stand up in you van.  An alternative ( that I have) is the
&quot;Car Top Tent&quot; which mounts to standard roof racks on any car, folds out and
is the size of a queen size bed.  Costs about $600 if I remember right.

&gt;  		Sink/stove/fridge/cabinets:  $4750 (actually, this 	
&gt;  			includes a lot more, so if the price looks high, 
&gt;  			that's why--cutains, fire ext, carpeting, 	
&gt;  			lights, water holder etc. etc.)
&gt;  		Bra for front:	$125   (Do you like it?)
&gt;  		Sun Roof:	$295
&gt;  		Luggage Rack:	$125
&gt;  		Awning:		$490	(Seems like nice to have)
&gt;  		Tent for rear:	$325	(envelopes rear to extend 	
&gt;  			back--also seems like a very nice thing to have)

I'd like to hear more about this last item.  Are all of these from Country
Homes?  Do they have a catalog that shows/describes these?  What's their
number?
