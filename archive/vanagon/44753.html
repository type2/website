     Have you actually ordered it from them?  I tried to order it about 1 
     month ago and was told it was out of print and no longer available 
     from them.

&gt;  But there's still hope. A gentleman named Tommy Sandham has 
&gt;  written a book titled 'Panel Craft', by Willow Publishing,
&gt;  Barecroft Common, Magor, Newport, Gwent, NP6 3EB. (Apparently,
&gt;  that is what passes for a street address in England. Good luck.) 
&gt;
&gt;  The British Library Cataloguing in Publication Data spif reads: 
&gt;
&gt;  Sandham, Tommy Panel Craft; Featuring Ford Cortina MK.1 bodyshell 
&gt;  restoration. 1. Automobiles -- Conservation and restoration --
&gt;  Amateur manuals
&gt;
&gt;  I Title 629.28'722 TL152.2
&gt;
&gt;  ISBN 0-9512523-0-5
     
     
If anyone has been looking for this book, I found it through Classic 
Motorbooks 800/826-6600. It's $31.95.
     
Cheers,
