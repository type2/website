&gt; of control, or running just fine).  What I've always wanted was a combo
&gt; oil temperature/oil pressure gauge to fit the hole.  I've looked in VW
&gt; magazines aplenty but I haven't seen any like this.  Does one exist?

Yes, there are gauges like that.  I have seen them in racing parts/supply
catalogs.  There are different combinations such as oil temp and pressure or
exhaust temp and boost, etc.  I think that they are expensive.  It's probably
much cheaper to get a set of VDO gauges instead.  They also have LCD displays
that show everything just like on Indy cars.

FYI, some of them carry lighten Lobro CV joints.  Now you can shave some
unsprung weight for faster acceleration.  ;-)
