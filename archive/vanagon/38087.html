Subject: re: Engine temp non-problem

    My question for the list:

    All you Diesel-Vanagon and Wasserboxer drivers out there, how
    long after you start your engines, does it take for the cooling
    fan to come on? Particularly in springtime weather-- it's around
    60 degrees here in San Diego where I'm doing this.

Well, in balmy Victoria my '88 has only come on when sitting in 
traffic more than 5 minutes or so, when the gauge reads about 3/4 
(just past the warning light). My Jetta is about the same way also.

    I'm sure I'll have better success(?) making the V6anagon
    overheat in July when it's 90 in a traffic jam, and the cooling
    fan had better come on then, if not sooner. But right now, I
    think it's just laughing at me. Wouldn't be the first time.
More likely your bus is still trying to figure out what is just 
swallowed.... ;-)

    Well, I can feel look-daggers coming my way already, due to my
    &quot;complaining&quot; about a car that just won't overheat, as well as
    the mention of 60 degree evenings in San Diego in March, so I'll
    close for now. 
Only 60?? Gee, up here in the Great White North, we had 60 in 
January, just in time for the tulips.... :-)

I've found my oil pressure gauge, along with the temp gauge, to give 
a better overall reading on the temp in the engine. My Jetta will 
show a drop in oil press. a minute or two before the coolant temp 
gauge shows a change, when climbing a long hill.
