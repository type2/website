Subject: Re: Request for .009 timing measurments


&gt;Does someone have the measurements [inches or cm] from 0
&gt;on a stock-sized crank pulley for 7.5 and 30 BTDC? I seem
&gt;to remember 7.5&quot; being about 3/8&quot; to the left of 0.

Er, and those are to the right (FIF) of zero, not left. Of course they're
the same on the left as well, if for some reason you don't want the plugs
to fire until the piston's at the bottom of the stroke. ;)
