Thought I'd share with other Eurovan folks a windfall I stumbled onto.

While rummaging this weekend I got an urge to stop at a used tire dealer  (other than 
intuition, I can't explain why).

As soon as I drove on the property, the dealer came out and said to me, &quot;have I got a 
deal for you!!&quot;

As we talked, seems that through, this dealers actions, he'd purchased several lots of 
tires from somewhere.  In one of the lots were varying odd sizes but for the dealer, it 
was a &quot;winner take all&quot; situation ... he took the whole group.

In the lot, the dealer had a set of Goodyear G-64, 6-ply, 195-70 and had no idea about 
what they fit or how to get rid of them.

When I arrived he immediately recognized the tires on my Eurovan and &quot;knew 
something had brought me&quot; to him.

We inspected the tires, measured the tread and all that stuff.  While I don't think the 
tires are new, there appeared to be minimal tread-wear.

The dealer asked if I would buy the tires and he'd stand by some type of warranty or 
help to cover expenses if they went bad, anytime soon. I agreed and ...surprise of 
surprises!!!

The dealer was so happy to get rid of them ... I paid $15 per tire for the set.

I took one to a Goodyear dealer and had it checked. The dealer thinks the tire had 
been driven less than a thousand miles (questimate). We could find no defects.

While I'm still amazed at this... seems the genie of &quot;VWdom&quot; has smiled my way!
