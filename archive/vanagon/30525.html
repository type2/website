&gt; The alternator could be suspect, but I haven't seen the alt light come on at
all. The
&gt;voltage at the battery terminals with the engine running is around 14
&gt;volts.
====================
A good rough check of the alternator/regulator is with the engine running and
high beam headlights and high blower heater fan on, check the voltage at the
battery.  It should be above 13 volts or better as the alternator &quot;carrys&quot; the
load.  You may have to put the idle up a bit, but if the voltage drops to 12.6
or lower no matter what the engine speed, you most likely have an
alternator/regulator system problem.
