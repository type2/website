&gt; &gt;coming up in a week or so:  A distinct (and now even occasionally loud) 
&gt; &gt;rattling noise coming from the shift lever in my '91 Westy (w/ manual 
&gt; &gt;transmission), when I'm driving in 3rd gear.  Sort of a tinny buzz.  It's 
&gt; &gt;also starting to do it on occasion in 4th.  Putting a little pressure up 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Had the slight humming noise in '87 Syncro in all gears. Went away with an 
&gt; oil change. I don't know why, oil change was part of my refurbishing work. 
&gt; Currently have a rattle in 3rd, due to too close clearance between shifter 
&gt; and housing. I did this on purpose as it cured a binding/impossible to get 
&gt; 1st. gear. There are slots in the ball carrier that are at 45 deg. which 
&gt; allow slight adjustment. Try loosening the two 10mm nuts under the shift 
&gt; boot. Slide your lever to the right slightly and road test. May affect your 
&gt; shifting, check 1st gear! To reposition 'properly' make sure the 2 holes in 
&gt; the carrier are above the holes in the mounting plate under it, you'll see! 
&gt; Have fun, tim s.
&gt; 

Thanks, Tim.  I'll check that out.  BTW, is  the syncro shifter mechanism 
the same as the standard 4-speed?  I do know that pushing on the shift 
lever - all about the plate - doesn't faze it.  Only thing that affects it 
is putting some lateral/up-down force on the shift lever.  I've noticed, 
incidentally, that in 1st or 2nd - which are quiet - there is no play, 
unlike 3rd/4th which has 1-2 inches of slop.
