Subject: SW BC (W WA?) Pizza!!


Ok, I've heard from Harry Yates and Jesus Dizon about camping.  Good.  
Camping sometime, someplace this summer we go, along with anyone else 
interested!  Yippee!

Pizza seems a little less difficult right now, at least until the snow 
melt off the mountains a bit!  :-)   Harry suggested the 2nd week of May 
for pizza.  Let's put faces to names and get all the area netters 
together.  According to Joel's stats, we got 10 in BC ('fraid a lot of 
these folks are on the Island), and 14 (count 'em!) in W Washington.
OK, maybe Seattle's a little far for pizza (maybe not...), but aren't 
there people up B'ham way?  Island people: here's an excuse to take the 
ferry!  :)

Suggestions on a restaurant?  Exact date? Etc, etc?

BTW, all who are interested, let me know where you live so we can try to 
meet in a place that's reasonably central.

Tobin
