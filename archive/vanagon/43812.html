Don't know if its relevant, but in Botswana, at all petrol (gas)
stations there is a small portable ramp.  When young drivers (VW or
other)  pull up they ask that the ramp be put behind the rear wheel
on the petrol-filler side of the vehicle and they back onto it,
elevating the car by maybe a foot or more. Must sell more petrol too.
