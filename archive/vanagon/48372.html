Subject: 86 Vanagon

I am the proud owner of a 86 Vanagon with a 2.1L engine and 4 on the floor.
I really lucked out with a perfect body and interior.

The previous owner, only one, had all of his servicing done at VW.
including new heads.

What I need to know is how hot should these engines get?  I was driving in
the city and watched the needle go 7/8ths of the way to the hot line before
the high speed fan kicked in.  Is that normal?

Also, since I just got it I want to change the fluids.  Is there a trick to
make sure I don't get air caught in the radiator, it's a long way from the
engine.  While I'm at it, is there another brand, other than VW, of
antifreeze that is phosphate free?

Thank you all very much.
