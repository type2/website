Subject: '85: Headlights on = Hot reading

Although I am not on the list anymore, I thought I might throw out this
strange situation.  Nothing exists in the archives that is similar to my
quandry.  

I evidently have some sort of electrical short.  When driving with
headlights off, my temp gauge reads normal..right above the LED.  When
headlights go on, it reads 3/4 of the way to the top and will flash
overheat in heavy traffic.  I am under the impression that this is a
false reading and not an actual overheat, because nothing smells hot and
the gauge will drop back down as soon the headlights go back off.  I
have checked dash and sender connections, all appears normal.

If you have ever experienced this, any advice would be *much*
appreciated.  

Thanks,

Jon
