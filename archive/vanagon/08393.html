Well the only thing I can think of, since this is becoming a 20 questions
sort of thing, is that in 1980 the USA somehow managed to win a gold at
the Olympic hockey tourney (do you believe in miracles?) and there may
have been a Mark Johnson on the team. As I recall Mark fell on some hard
times (read couldn't cut it in the NHL where the Canadians play). Still if
this is true surely Mark has
some wheaties commercials to shoot, or some Finns to go beat up, and the
bigger question is why is he driving a VW.... --
