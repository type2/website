Subject: Re: /f: Groundhogs &amp; Lurkers

I was reading about the Knights of Labor earlier this evening and how they
were the first labor organization (1869 - 1886) that allowed common,
unskilled laborers to join their ranks.  AFter reading Joel's comment
(below) I suddenly understood how the common laborer felt.  I don't have a
bus (skill, craft) and although I'm allowed to join the list (union), my
status is just a bit different (not lower mind you) than those who own
buses (are skilled and crafty). 

One of the factors in the demise of the Knights of Labor was the sometimes
stronger identification the skilled workers (bus owners) had with other
skilled workers (bus owners) than their identification with a broader
&quot;brotherhood&quot; which included unskilled laborers (wannabus and lurkers). 

Pardon my foolishness.  Reading and thinking too much makes for weird 
associations sometimes...

&gt; &gt;I don't get it.  If I post and everyone sees my moniker does that mean
&gt; &gt;I'm no longer a lurker?  And does this mean I can now legitimately go on
&gt; &gt;a diet and get my fur cut???
&gt; 
&gt; nah. only if *I* know what model/year/type/etc. bus you drive/own (or if
&gt; you want one, that means you are a Wanabus, instead of an Unknown) ...
&gt; and, of course, the nearest large city. :)
&gt; 
&gt; oh, and fur has nothing to do with Lurking. :) or dieting.
