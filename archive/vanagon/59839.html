Subject: Re: Water in headlights

&gt; Has anyone ever tried placing the headlights in the oven (at low temp) to
&gt; bake out the moisture?

The headlights themselves?  I'm not sure this is possible;  if there was
moisture inside the lamp, well, it wouldn't last too long.

I note you have a square-headlight '88;  I haven't heard of any general
moisture problem inside the lamp housing,  but suspect it would evaporate
pretty quickly when the lamp itself is turned on.

Or the lamp housing in general?  I've had moisture accumulate in the
right-rear tail lamp housing after extended exposure to rain conditions;
once I'm back home,  I bring the housing inside and let it sit atop my
monitor for a couple of hours.  Nice and warm,  and no worries about melting
anything... on the other hand,  I worry about drip-zap'ing my monitor :-)

Haven't been able to figure out how the water is getting in there, tho;
The seal looks good and there are no cracks.
