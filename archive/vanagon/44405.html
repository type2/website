&gt;hey now,

&gt;i was wondering...doing my rebuild my friend sean noticed that my crankcase

&gt;leak was coming from.
&gt;
&gt;earlier i was thinking about just replacing it...i can get one for $250
&gt;and this would come with the bottom end also...but Bob Hoover suggested
&gt;that the aluminum cases can be welded and rewelded. i respect bob's
&gt;advice and it's helped me on more then one occassion. i'd like to hear
&gt;what others have done in the past...just to get an overview of the whole
&gt;deal. i'm leaning towards welding...but i want to do this right since i'm
&gt;dropping a buttload of money into the van..it's a keeper. :-)

Bob is right.  I have never had to weld an aluminum case, but I've had a
lot of other alum parts welded, like cylinder heads, without problems.  My
personal VW-engine-rebuilding-bible, Tom Wilson's &quot;How to Rebuild your Air
Cooled VW&quot; states very clearly that welding cracked cases is no problem.

Here's some more friendly advice:  You shouldn't even be attempting this
job without getting and reading a copy of the above book.
