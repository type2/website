Andy;
I do have a '72 and the stock distributor and carbs. (actually, the carbs 
are a little newer but the part numbers are the same.)  If you know how 
to hook it up I would really apreciate some instruction.  
thanks.
Ed.

&gt; I'm assuming you have a '72. 
&gt; It's a vacuum advance cutoff switch. If you don't have the stock carbs and
&gt; distributor, it's useless. As with all emissions equipment, save it. You'll need
&gt; it eventually.
