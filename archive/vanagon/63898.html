Subject: Pop Top Seal - leading edge
Date: Fri, 15 Aug 1997 16:24:16 -0400

I replaced my pop top seals ('85 Westy) with new seals from Bus Boys last
fall (pre Bus Depot).  The seal for the entire pop top, all the way around
was the same material, same dimentions.  Now the front piece (leading edge
of pop top)  is split between the &quot;bulb&quot; and the area the clips are in and
Bus Boys want me to send it back before they will replace it.  How I'm
supposed to drive around without it I don't know.  
I have noticed that the original leading edge seals are longer and flat.  I
can't find anyone that has a replacement.  Ron at Bus Depot told me
poptops_dot_com had it but no luck.  Can anyone out there tell me where to get
that piece?

Any info greatly appreciated.  Also does anyone know who sells Lloyds floor
mats for front of Vanagon, carpet type?

TIA

Wendy
