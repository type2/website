&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Winnebago converts some of the Eurovans into mini-motorhomes, by adding
&gt; &gt; Winnebago's own body (aft of the front doors) that's about 20&quot;-24&quot; wider than
&gt; &gt; the normal Eurovan.  Inside they install sink, stove, refer, toilet and other
&gt; &gt; stuff.  While the Winnebago body is tall (as even mini-motorhomes are) there
&gt; &gt; is no pop-top in this version.  They name this vehicle the Rialta and sell
&gt; &gt; them through Winnebago's own network of RV dealers.  List price is about
&gt; &gt; $45,000 I think.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I just looked at one of these last weekend.  I think it had to have been 
&gt; a '97 as it had the VR6 engine.  However, the price on the window was 
&gt; $55,000.

	I recall the sticker one the 97 EVs at Autohaus in Lancaster, PA to
more like $35K, maybe a few more.  $55K or $45K are both absurd.
