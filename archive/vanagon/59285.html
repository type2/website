Subject: Re: Vanagon in Car Talk

Click and Clack may not be everyone's style, and their radio show is
definitely not for callers who's feelings are easily hurt, but they are
very sharp guys, both MIT graduates, Tom with a doctorate from Boston
University, etc. 

Rest assured they DO know Vanagons have 2 heads. They've seen all the
old ones, and test drive all the new ones (cars, that is). Remember, any
newspaper column you see in has been massaged by the same people who
mangle your want ad.
