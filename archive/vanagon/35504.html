Dean &amp; Opie axed...
&gt; Last night I got underneath to change the cable, and it is not broken.  The
&gt; pedal actuates the cross shaft, but nothing else is happening.  I will drop
&gt; the engine tomorrow to take a look.  What can I expect?  Pressure plate
&gt; replacement?

I'd expect the throw-out bearing to be slipped off the cross-shaft.  It's
happened to be on my previous 67 and current 70 Buses.  Of course you will
need to drop the engine.
