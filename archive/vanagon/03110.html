Subject: Vancouver.CANADA! - ASI


Sorry, I had forgotten there was a Vancouver in Washington, but the
one I meant was Vancouver, CANADA!  If somebody really wants it
and can't find it via the usual phone information channel, let
me know and I'll dig thru some buried papers.  I talked with
them about 6 months or so, ago.  I have a vague recollection
that they may have been taken over by another group, but can't
remember if they retained their name.  I do remember the man there
telling me that some of the parts were still available.  In
addition, I probably have some bruchures for these from around
the early 80's.  The brochures I think reflect possibilities for
design mostly in breadloafs, despite the brochure year.
