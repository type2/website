Subject: Re: Help - 84 Westy inside sliding door handle screw




&gt; &gt;I lost the screw which holds the interior handle for the sliding
&gt; &gt;door on. I will just go to the hardware store to buy a new one,
&gt; &gt;however I would really like to know the proper dimensions of the
&gt; &gt;screw.  Does anyone have a manual which would list that part?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I lost the same on my '81. Actually purchased one from the dealer for less
&gt; than one dollar a couple of years ago. I couldn't believe VW carried a part
&gt; for less than a buck.
 
WOW!  I just phoned VW and you're right.  The part is only $1.54!  
Hey everybody,  rejoice! 

( I guess that one part isn't made out of unobtainium or something
eh?)

Thanks.
