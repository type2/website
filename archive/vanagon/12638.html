So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Calm down.  You were not being flamed!  We are merely commenting on
&gt; the claim of the advertiser that he has some rare item, which really isn't
&gt; so rare.   Its kinda like talking back to the TV (television, not transvestite-
&gt; dad would slap me for talking back)

Yeh, but you needed to be slapped Thom!  ;p
