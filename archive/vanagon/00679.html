My refrigerator won't stay lit for more than a short while. I wonder if 
this is the same problem. I've been all through the same routine of 
various repairmen saying it can't be fixed, bad design, spiders, igniter, 
and on and on. Now.....you're saying to put the compressed air tube up 
the little tube at the bottom left side of the refrig.....underneath the 
fridge on the left?
