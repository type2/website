&gt;The owners manual says to push the passengers seat all the way

&gt;Under the drivers seat is a nice hinged panel to acces the second
&gt;battery compartment.  Is the passengers side a DPO conversion?

Nope, this is the way it's designed.  The trick is to SPIN the passenger
seat around, then slide it forward (with relation to the vehicle.)  This
gives you full access.
