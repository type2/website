Subject: My window won't stay fixed

Hello vanagon gang,
The window on the driver's side won't stay fixed.  It is as simple as that.
So far, I have taken my door apart 4 times in 3 days to fix the thing, and
pretty soon, it comes apart again.  Has anyone else had this particular
frustration?  How have you fixed it?  I am considering installing metal
plates over a small square nylon guide which exist in these things
(if you have had your door apart, you know what I mean, I think).  Is 
there a better way?
Stuart
