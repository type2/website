Subject: Re: Westy auxiliary battery (why not keep it going)



I'd like to second David Schwarze's advice to not drain a lead acid
battery more than 80-75% full charge. Addition to thicker plates, a deep
cycle battery should also have more clearance beneath the plates to allow
a greater amount of lead sulfate (I think its lead sulfate) to accumulate
before it bridges the plates. Lead sulfate is part of the charge storage
mechanism, but some of it &quot;drops out of&quot; the reversible reaction,
especially if you deep discharge the battery.

My apologies to any electrochemists that read this:)
