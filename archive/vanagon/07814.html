&gt; What seat did you put in? How higher are they? Does your head now rub

&gt; Enquiring minds want to know.

I put in seats from a 73 Capri.  I had them left over from a car I parted
out, so my motivation was not so much that they are great seats, but that
they were free and they were in the way in my garage.  :)  They are pretty
good seats, though.  Much more comfortable than the old VW seats, which
were pathetic.  

I measured the seats as being about 9 inches tall from base to the top
of the lower cushion, but they are buckets and are less high in the center.
The stock seats were only about 4 to 5 inches tall, and flat.  Some of the
added height came from the mounting brackets and the board underneath the
seat (5/8&quot; plywood).  

I sit noticeably higher now, but fortunately I had a lot of headroom to
start with, and there is still plenty.  The main drawback that I have
noticed is that I have a less good view out of the windows now.  Not
good for road trips where lots of time is spent looking at scenery.  I
am an even 6 feet tall, btw.
