Subject: Re: Optimal bus to bring to Germany


&gt;Ok, perhaps not everyone shares my enthusiasm for a TDI engine
&gt;conversion project. Here are some other alternatives:

&gt;For importing cars to Germany:

&gt;1. to avoid import taxes you have to have been in the US for at least one
&gt;year, and owned the vehicle for at least 6 months.

&gt;2. the car has to pass technical inspection (TUV) and smog inspection.

This have to be done every two years. Smog inspection will be no
problem to US registered cars.

&gt;3. the car has to be modified to german standards - mainly front and rear
&gt;lights and instrumentation (km/h)

For rear lights you only may change the bulbs. For instrumentation
I'm not sure if you have to change this. But the way the turning
light is operating in US have to be changed for German licensing.
The total exchange costs will be DM 1,000.00 to DM 2,000.00 I guess.

&gt;4. if that exact car/engine combination is not available (therefore 
unknown)
&gt;to the german TUV, then engine output, max. vehicle speed and noise level
&gt;(inside and outside, idle and certain speed) have to be determined since
&gt;they will be stated in the german title

There will be no problem if you have a car's specification sheet. This
is available from VW. Also a specialist at the Mannheim TUV subsidiary
have most of US car specification sheets and he is the best to ask
for vehicle imports to Germany.

&gt;5. if (in this case) it is a camper with propane tank, the whole propane
&gt;system has to be visually checked whether it meets german standards and
&gt;pressure-checked whether it is safe

And the installation has to follow the German safety rules. This test
has to be done every year at TUV or other plumbers certified for propane
installations. Most of camping parts suppliers are owner of this
certificate.

&gt;6. US-campers are equipped for 110V/60Hz external power (and the US
&gt;connectors), this would have to be changed to german system (220V/50Hz) and
&gt;connectors

We have a special system for mobile equipments which is not compatible
with the standard socket system in Germany. Therefore and if you like
to travel through Europe you will need several adapters to meet all
systems. The vehicle sockets must not be changed. For your installation
you will need a transformer from 230V to 110V. Not all of your 110V
equipment will work with 50Hz. Some will be blown up because of
overheating the 110V-down transformer. But all simple devices (fridge,
hair-dryer) will have no problems.
