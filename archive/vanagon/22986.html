Subject: Re: '66 westy table

     &gt;it awaits.  so, anyone got any ideas as to value?  i'm lost but want 
     &gt;the darn thing.  thanks   ray  gainesville, fl
     &gt;oh yeah, it's the big table that folds up on the driver's side about 
     &gt;midway back.
     
     I reckon you'd expect to pay about 30 pounds over here for an original 
     Devon table, same idea, and just as rare.
