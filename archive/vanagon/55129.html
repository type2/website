Subject: 87 Burning Oil
Date: Tue, 28 Jan 1997 11:05:08 -0600

Help please!
I have a 1987 2.1L which burns oil.  It only burns for about 3 or 4 seconds
and only happens at low rpm under stress (i.e. going up a hill).  When it
starts burning a big blue cloud, about the size of the van comes out, there
is also a metalic tapping noise, loud enough to be heard from the drivers
seat.  There is also a BIG loss of power.  The engine uses about 1 quart of
oil per 400 to 1000 miles, it varies greatlly.  This started recently, I
would say since it got cold.  Right now it's 0 deg. F outside and I am
using 10w40, changed oil about 100 miles ago.  The engine has about 6,000
miles on it, it's a factory rebuilt.  Does anyone have any idea's on what's
wrong?

Thanks
