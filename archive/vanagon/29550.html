Hi, volks

'Just got back from the SF auto show; about the same as every other year.

The VW booth had a WinneVan thing like last year, and it was death try-
ing to even get near it, what with rugrats and their parents clamoring
about (I can say this because I fall into this category).

I didn't get any word re: the soon to be VR6 EuroVan replacement, be
it the EuroVan or Sharan.  Perhaps someone who went to the show
can pass along some encouraging words.  Speaking of which, at the
prices some of the auto mfrs. are asking for cars, those of us looking
for 6 cylinder power in our vans best be hanging around your favorite
Porsche recycler.

Also seen outside the show (Moscone Ctr), was a white EV MV (non poptop)
with all sorts of nastiness to spread about VW, for example:
On the back window:  &quot;My VW Mistake&quot;
then in smaller print something about plastic bumpers, hidden repairs not
disclosed, side mounted gas tanks, blah, blah, blah....
Did you know that VW stood for &quot;be Very Wary of (Volkswagen)&quot;?
Wow!  I learn something new every day!

I was just wondering why, if this guy/gal had such a bone to pick, didn't
s/he just ditch the thing and get something else (like the dreaded Chrysler
products)?

Lastly, but not leastly, a big thanks to Richard Palmer for a fine job on
Pt.2
of the vanagon list t-shirts.  I received mine in good order the day after
Thanksgiving.  Bravo!
