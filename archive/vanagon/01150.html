Subject: Rear Wheel Bearings 86 Vanagon

Hi all,

I have a &quot;roaring&quot; noise from the left rear wheel - most likely the bearings.
Aside from the horror stories I've read (and saved) about getting the NUT
off, is their any other tricks I need to know.  The Bentley book shows a
SPACER between the inner and outer bearings - does this get replaced as
well?  Expected prices for the complete bearing set???  Thanks,

Kerry  '86 Syncro
