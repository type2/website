Hi Everyone,

While driving home today I saw an 87 Westy for sale. I had to take a test
drive. The van is beautiful and runs great. It just had rebuilt heads and
gaskets done and all that good stuff. In order to get this gem I have to
sell the Westy I have now. So here it is, priced for quick sale:

1983 Vanagon L Westfalia - light brown
just passed NJ inspection
heads redone 10k miles ago
new water pump
new air flow meter
new fuel injectors
new tires
upper and lower ball joints
KYB shocks all around
upper control arms
all camping equipment present and accounted for - stove and fridge work
great./ Fridge fires up first time on gas.
Needs some cosmetic work on exterior
asking $2800.00

The van is located in Flemington, NJ.
