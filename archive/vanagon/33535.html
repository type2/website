&gt;&gt;I still can't figure out why when the starter is engaged the juice to the
&gt;&gt;coil goes out...only to return the moment I release the key and the starter 
&gt;&gt;stops. Is this the norm? I don't think so.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I need help...Martin
&gt;
&gt;Seems like years ago  I ran into the same trouble with my friends 66 
&gt; Chevy pickup, it turned out to be an external resistor (barristor) on 
&gt; the wire going to the coil.  Back track and check the voltage all the 
&gt; way to the battery if you have to, it will take less time and be much 
&gt; better than rerouting the voltage. If you need diagrams I can copy out 
&gt; what I have and mail/fax them to you.

&gt;Thanks for your thoughts,
 When you say check the voltage all the way to the battery what exactly do you 
 mean?  I'm getting voltage to the switch and when the key is in the &quot;on&quot;
 position I get 12volts to the coil.  It's just that when I turn the key to 
 turn on the starter everything including most of the fuse panel go dead until
 that starter is off...very odd.
