Subject: Re: Newest Leak: Fixed!

Thanks for the advice on plastic metal for stud fixing, JBWeld came out on 
top, including FLAPS and VW service recommendation. Leak is fixed, 
alternator bracket in place and... I finally have dry cylinder heads, er... 
for 2 days of city driving so far. Will highway test this weekend.
         It _appears_  that it is possible to fix badly corroded wasserboxer 
cylinder heads with this stuff (and fresh gaskets). As I mentioned, this 
cheapo fix has been OK for 10 months or so. I'll let you know when/if this 
fails and leaks again, otherwise, no news is good news.   tim s.
