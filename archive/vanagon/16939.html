Some kind soul was looking for the source of the tall roofed vanagon camper.

Adventurewagen in ft. Bragg CA.  made these and discontinued production after
the last of the syncro vanagons left the factory.  The tall superstructure
allowed standing room and a bunk.  The interiors are quality work with the
usuall accoutrements.  If you call Adventurewagen in Ft. Bragg, CA you could
inquire about having it done.  They shifted their focus to full size US vans
a few years ago.  

And he also asked about awnings.

I have a 10ft awning manufactured by A&amp;E, a subsidiary of Dometic, it's tidy,
fits with three rain gutter adapters, and is fairly strong.  A&amp;E used to 
manufacture a more basic model the Transawn 2000, mine is the Catalina 2500.

jon peters has a Fiamm awning he bought in Europe for the &quot;synkro&quot;.  I think
derek has a Catalina too.  

They work, they're easy to set up and great in the desert or the rain.

They do present a wind problem unless staked out.  On the white rim trail
in canyonlands NP I destroyed the supports and the replacements were tres-cher.

But the wind gusts were ~50mph.
