Subject: 009 installed and a question

well i put that new brazilian 009 in the single yesterday.  it seams to
work fine so far.  we will see if i get any trouble out of it as time
goes.

a Q for you all.   this truck has had a history of stalling alot.  i have
to run the iddle real high in order to idle.  it runs fine at high rpm.  i
found that the old distributor had a frozzen advance plate (diaphram type)
and a broken ground wire.  would these make the engine stall?  i hope so,
but do not know.  i am wondering if it in fact the carborator.  i do no
tknow yet.

anyway, thanks

Take care and God Bless
matt
