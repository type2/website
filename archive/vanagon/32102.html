Subject: Re: VW Ads(was about splitties)

There are a few ads that I remember, though I cannot remember what the captions
were, nor if they were splits, or bays:

1. Showed a Bus superimposed over a station wagon with the engine compartment,
and the rear fins extending from the front and back of the bus, saying some-
thing about twice the storage space, half the size

2. Showed a sunroof bus with a sunfish sailboat inside, with the stern sticking
 out the rear hatch, and the mast and sail sticking out the sunroof with a
caption saying approx: &quot;Can you guess what it is?&quot;

Another showed a bug with the caption saying something like can you see all
43 changes made to the new beetle.

And one other showing a Ghia with some comment about Italian styling, and
German reliablity.

Cheers,

David
