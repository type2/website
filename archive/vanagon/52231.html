&lt;&lt; Second, my front windshield washer pump is
 meekly pushing out fluid. I have cleaned the jets, made sure the tank is
 full. I replaced the pump about 7 months ago with a used one. Should I just
 go new? Anything else to check? TIA &gt;&gt;

Yes.  The plastic tubes can get kinked and restrict flow to a trickle.  Also,
despite cleaning out the nozzles, they can still be clogged inside.  Buy a
couple of new nozzle assemblies (you'll likely destroy the old ones removing
them) &amp; then pull your old ones out and you can examine the nozzle end of the
tube for kinks.

Good luck,
