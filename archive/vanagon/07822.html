Huh? A black disc of almost-petrified sponge on a stick?

This is not some sort of evolved 3-M Scotchbrite pad thing, is it?

Come to think of it, some species of sponge probably could be used as an
effective abrasive, ie the ones with silicate spicules - glass sponges.

Yeh, thats it, glass sponges for body work, can mix the broken ones with
resin as filler. Hey and maybe we can use spermaceti as a tranny lube...
