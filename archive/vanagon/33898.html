Subject: To all NEATO, SSVC and old busers!

I thought I'd posted this but I seem to have some mail problems...just to
advise again that if you are a member of SSVC or NEATO you can now take out
reciprocal membership...basically in addition to your normal club dues/fees
you also pay the overseas member rate as well. This gives you full membersh=
ip
of your sister club with all those benefits...especially you can now get a =
Bus
mag EVERY month as Split Screen Scene and Old Bus Review come out alternate
months. You do not have to have a Split to join either club, just a love of
them! NEATO folks &amp; Americas contact Tom Brouillette, Europe etc contact me=
..
We start the scheme this March to run 12 months from April. 
Sorry if this repeated itself and clogged you up.....Dave
