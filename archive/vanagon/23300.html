&gt; &gt; Maybe the more important question is: why waste the propane when you
&gt; &gt; have another source of power that is immediately available and does
&gt; &gt; not tax any other resources (while the engine is on)?  am I missing
&gt; &gt; something?

&gt; 3. The almost 20 amp draw of the fridge on the alternator does draw some 
&gt; engine power and effect milage somewhat.

20 amps?  That's outrageous!  Do those three way fridges really draw
that much??  I realize it's not the same technology, but my old Norcold
only drew 4.5 amps, and my new one draws around 7.  I was pretty upset
about that - I thought 7 amps was bad!  Regardless, David is right that
it will put a load on your engine, and decrease your gas mileage.  20
amps would, I imagine, be a significant load.  Enough to pull down your
idle a few rpm.

On the issue of safety, I'm not trying to argue for running the fridge
on propane while driving, but how exactly is it more dangerous?  Is it
just because there is a lit flame?  I don't see how driving makes it
any more dangerous than having a lit flame when you are parked.  Sorry
if I'm overlooking something simple here.
