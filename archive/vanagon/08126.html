	Jim,
	St. Muir was a good and fine man, but I wouldn't bother
to unhook the electromagnetic cutoff (Which is actually an
electromagnetic enabler- it only allows gas through when you
put 12V across it.) Meaning to say, where is the possible harm
in the thing, as long as it works? If it broke, I'd be strongly
inclined to blank it off, but that's a separate issue, and depends
on how much is needed to fill the resulting hole. Certainly, metric
threaded bolts suggest themselves...

	Regarding the electric choke, it certainly true that a poorly
functioning choke will make the engine run poorly, AND put out a
far-too-rich mixture, which will dilute the oil and foul the plugs
and other bad things. I'd overhaul everything, and see if it will
idle without the choke after the overhaul. If you find yourself pumping
the pedal to keep the engine running when cold, then you're using the
accelerator pump to accomplish the same enrichment the choke it intended
to acomplish. But you can stop pumping as soon as the engine doesn't
need it. Do you want to give the engine the very least enrichment
possible, using yourself as the control element? Or do you want the
engine to start and idle feet-off? Attention versus convenience.

	I certainly use the manual choke to start the neighborhood
rototiller, or my father-in-law's '63 Triumph Herald.
