Subject:      importation success

Just thought I'd let the list know that I successfully imported a '79 westy
from Canada to the US a couple of weeks ago.  Thanks to those who helped
get me started with the procedure.  I will write details in the future of
how to go about doing this, but if anyone has any question about importing
a vehicle, I'd be happy to help.  The bottom line is that it's possible
even in cases when you might think it's not possible.  You just have to
know the rules AND the exceptions to the rules.

On another note, after parking at US customs in Niagra Falls and getting
my paperwork (I was as polite as I could be), the westy wouldn't start.
I had to push start it all the way back to NJ.  Fortunately, I picked up
a couple of hitchhikers in town who said they wanted to go to Cleveland
but were willing to go to NYC.  They helped with some of the push starting,
and I dropped them off in Manhattan.  I did get stuck at some NJ turnpike
toll booths and managed to push start it myself, running with the bus and
jumping in to pop the clutch.  I've since replaced the starter. . . it's
such a luxury to turn the key and have it start.
