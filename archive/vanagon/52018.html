Subject: Re: Yoko Y370s


&gt; Can someone send me/post more info on these tires?  I came in on the tail 
&gt; end of the thread and want to know what makes them so special.  Also, the 
&gt; complete designation of the model number would be helpful as well.  I 
&gt; called a local shop and they asked me if they were 2Ds or Gs and I wasn't 
&gt; able to say based on the postings I've seen.
&gt; 
This is all I have, based on a 1995 Light Truck Tire Guide, printed 
by Yokohama Canada:

Y370:
LT195/75R14
Load Range D
Ply Rating 8
Approved Rim Widths: 5.0 - 6.0 in.
Groove Depth: 8.8 mm
Max Load _at_ Max PSI: 1710lbs _at_ 65psi

Width: 207mm / 8.1 in
Diameter: 649mm / 25.6in
Static Radius: 301mm / 11.9in
Revs/Mile: 818

Only thing I can't tell you is where to find them, outside of 
Vancouver, at least.

Their web site at: http://www.yokohamatire_dot_com/index.html
makes no mention of this tire, but I left a message asking why...
