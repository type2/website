Subject: Emission Controls, etc.


Is there something I'm not getting here with this pissin' and moanin' about 
the EPA, DOT, etc. True, I'm no lover of all those things Unka Sam makes us 
put in our cars to make us safer...but hmmm...you know something some of 
them work....like seatbelts....like side intrusion beams, etc..

Back in the early 70's I prided myself on being able to &quot;desmog&quot; almost any 
engine. In those days, the emissions devices were nothing more than 
half-assed add-ons. Cars ran like crap as a result. Emission controls began 
to show up 30 years ago with PCV systems. Some of us can remember seeing 
those old blow-by pipes under the engine of a car spewing oil vapor iln 
great clouds at every stop sign while a car sat.

Today, emission controls are a hell of a lot better with the advent of 
computerized fuel injection, etc. I guess the point is if you want to see 
what &quot;non-emission controlled&quot; cars/trucks do to the atmosphere...go to 
Mexico City, go to any major city in the former East Germany...hell, I was 
in Turin, Italy this January on what was called a sunny day. Well, you could 
have fooled me....at 3pm there was so much &quot;smog&quot; and haze I had to drive 
with my lights on to see.

Point being is that after 30 years of emission controlled vehicles our air 
is a hell of a lot cleaner....and it is ironic that the gasoline powered 
devices which polute the most are now lawnmowers and chain saws.

So if you are still pissin' and moaning about emission contols, big brother, 
the &quot;men in white coats&quot;, do me a favor, spend a couple of days in Mexico 
City, Turin, etc. If you can't afford it, take a long hose...hook it up to 
your tail pipe...route the hose into your vehicle, and drive around for a 
couple of hours.
