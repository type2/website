&gt; A plastic 1 gal size container UL approved etc. fits into the spare tire

&gt; fill the can to the max so it won't slosh much.  This is worth maybe 20
&gt; miles, really doesn't get you too far. Fairly solid place in the event of a
&gt; crash, well shielded. I think you can get a round can that fits the rim
&gt; better, 2.5 gal. maybe, but the price is way higher.  Tim

CAUTION!

If you opt to do this, check *above* the spare, many vanagons (if not
all water-cooled) have a metal projecting bracket above the spare which
must be removed before tucking anything in there.
