Subject: Re: external cooler/filter : trust the dipstick?

&gt; 
&gt; With all that hose and cooler and filter up above the case, it seems
&gt; to me that perhaps you can't trust the dipstick any more.  Would the
&gt; extra oil from the cooler/filter/hoses drain back down into the case
&gt; and make it appear over-filled when it's really OK?
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm,
&gt; 
&gt; -Mitch
&gt; 
The same applies in reverse as well. If the hoses run below the engine
(and then back up above the tranny) there will always be oil that is not in
the crankcase making the level seem underfilled.

The best strategy is to calculate the volume of the hoses and cooler and
fill to that volume at every change. Even marking the dipstick at this new
level will give an accurate reading. You can only hope that the engine is not leaking or burning copious
amounts of oil - topping up periodically after a long trip might help.

BTW- I calculated the extra volume for a cooler above the tranny to be 
little more than a litre.
