Subject: Tires Again!

Dear Vanagoners:

I got tires for my '89 Westy yesterday and I may have a little problem.  I
ordered 3 Michelin XZX 185/70 SR 14 to go with my original spare.  The
problem is that the XZX is no longer in production.  So I received 3
Micheling MX 185/70 R 14's.  These are reinforced sidewall tires and will
carry 1540lbs per tire at 40 psi max pressure.  The problem is that the door
sticker says 50psi in the back.  

Does anyone have any experience with MX's??  

Should I send them bak and get something else???  If so, what?


Frustrated in Austin.
