Subject: Local AZ Politics and my VWs (f)

Mrs.VanBondo came out back of the house to the garage carrying a clipboard
and pen. &quot;So &amp; so is at the door gathering signatures to get &quot;someone's&quot;
name on the November ballot for the local schoolboard. Would I sign? &quot;Sure,
why not.&quot;
She returns later to say that the clipboard lady asked if we were into
&quot;collecting&quot; VW buses? &quot;Uh, we have a couple right now, yes.&quot; Did she have a
line on one? =)?? &quot;No!&quot; Clipboard lady then pointed toward the out of town
neighbor's house and guessed that the '81 was ours as well. &quot;Yup, but its
for sale.&quot; Clipboard lady then mumbles something half hearted like &quot;Oh,
great.&quot; My wife got the feeling that the lady thought we were about to cause
blight and dispair in the 'hood and propagate evil substances in the back 40.
I laughed, shook my head, and smiled glad that I wasn't living my life to
please every tight a**ed Yuppie wannabe repub... (Oops, I didn't say that)
Ahem, ...everyone with an opinion.
I went back to work happily humming an old blues tune called &quot;Mind yo' own
business.&quot; I need to ask Mrs. VanBondo what the candidate's name was. I
think I've already made up my mind. ;-)
