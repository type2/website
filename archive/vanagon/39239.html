Subject: $2000 for a '76 camper??

Hi all,
	Thank you all for the great replies regarding the cost of 
restoring a '67. I looked at a '76 pop top on Friday. It had a 
professionally rebuilt engine with 30k miles(1700), new front beam, and a 
gas heater (although the owner has never used it and is not sure it 
works), and new tires.  The body has some rust, worst being under the 
sliding door, the two front wheel arches, and the engine lid(also a dent 
just behind the sliding door. The pop-top was excellent, 
it popped straight up and had a vinyl material on the outside. The 
interior was good, with a sink, cooler, table, and various cabinets. The 
seats in the back need to be redone. Engine ran great, I didn't get a 
chance to drive it. The owner is asking $2000. Thanks in advance.
-Greg
