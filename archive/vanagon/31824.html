Subject: RE: 1600 in a 73 - round 2

&gt;Brandy Smith wants to know how hard it would be to make new engine tin to
&gt;fit a Type 1 engine lost in the cavern of a Type 4 engine compartment.

Thinking aloud here.....
If you consider a swap like this (as I have many times), keep in mind that 
the transmission main shaft is different - shorter for the type 1, I 
believe.  So, if you decide it's still worth it, and get a complete 
tranny/engine set for swap, it will work.  The type 4 engine is a good 
engine.  It has all the things done to it already that you should do to a 
type 1 engine to make it last - full flow oil filter, sealed crankcase (i.e. 
no sand seal required), aluminum case as well as an alternator and crank 
driven fan.  After doing all that should be done to a type 1 to make it 
&quot;right&quot;, you might be closer to the cost of a type 4 than you think.  A type 
1 would have to work much harder for the same horsepower, stressing it's 
cooling to the limit.  The 1700 that came in your '73 is a conservatively 
built engine, i.e. uses the same crank &amp; case as the 2000 (although the 2000 
has the crank journals turned off-center for more stroke, giving even 
smaller journal diameters).

&gt;When you are computing relative value of Type 1 versus Type 4, keep in
&gt;mind that, all other things being equal, the Type 4 will last longer.
I agree, and think that even if a type 1 was built with all the type 4 
features, and all other things being equal (usage, maintenance, etc), it 
still won't last as long 'cause the type 1 will be &quot;working harder&quot; 
(assuming 1600) where as the 1700-2000 would still be somewhat conservative. 
 Pushing busses around is hard work.
