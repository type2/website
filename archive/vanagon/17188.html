&gt; &gt;         I got the most monster wave from a guy in a vanagon today.  I was

&gt; &gt; vanagon shopping.  Anyway, it was the first wave I have gotten from anyone 
&gt; &gt; in a vanagon.  Me thinks that the vanagon owners are snobby around here.

&gt; I've waved at probably fifteen or twenty different Vans, buses, 
&gt; microbuses, Westy's and only one has waved back.  But, I've had three 
&gt; bugs and two little Jettas or Sciroccas (sp?) wave to me first!!!  The 
&gt; fact that they were young good looking women has nothing to do with my 
&gt; being so happy about it ; )

I find that in town, almost nobody waves.  Occaisionally someone in a
split window bus will.  Out on the highway, I seldom pass a split or
Breadloaf that doesn't wave back.  When others post about people waving
or not waving, are they talking about in town or on the open road?  I
think it makes a huge difference.  It's much stranger seeing those old
busses so far away from the closest repair shop!
