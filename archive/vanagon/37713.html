&gt;VW makes buses.  Whether you can get them or not has nothing to do with
&gt;the government.  I got a new VW bus just a year or so ago.  Nobody
&gt;considers it dirty or unsafe.  It is I believe highly rated in the safety
&gt;categories.  You can't get the old rear engined buses because nobody was
&gt;buying them anymore.  It was a market decision to go to the EV/T4.  The
&gt;beetle and rear engined bus were dropped when they dropped in sales.

        Sure, there's lots of VW busses to be had. But not breadloaves. I
didn't mean to say that VW no longer makes busses, only that the folks in
charge won't let me bring home one of the styles I happen to like. I guess
I didn't articulate that very well, sorry. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I do
believe that the beetle was discontinued because it no longer was able to
meet emmissions standards, set by the federal government.

&gt;Oh you want a Mexibus.  I doubt it.  The Mexican VWs do not live up to
&gt;the German VWs.  If the original VW was like the Mexican made ones there
&gt;would not likely have been a VW Beetle phenomenon.  The desire for the
&gt;Mexibugs and Mexibuses is an emotional tie to the German ones.

        Mebbe so. I'd like to learn that one the hard way please, thank you.
&gt;
&gt;I've conversed with the other poster involved before this latest one.  We
&gt;pretty much agree on most things.  I was ina funny mood because of
&gt;running a fever up to 103.8  Does weird things to the brain.

        Ok, guess my not having a fever made me look at this from a
slightly different point of veiw.
&gt;
&gt;The government has imposed safety regulations on auto-manufacturers.  But
&gt;it has specifically ruled any single design as untenable.  You can make a
&gt;safe beetle.  (VW is trying a variation on that.)  You can make a safe
&gt;Bus.  VW makes one.  I have one.  It great.

        Again, I didn't mean to say VW makes no bus, I meant the gov. don't
let me have bus I want. Me want Mexibus. They no let. Me mad.
&gt;
&gt;Nothing to do with guys in ties.  I live in among many of the governemnt
&gt;workers since I'm just outside of DC.  I even did a contract at DOT.  The
&gt;guys involved didn't actually wear ties.  Drop the stereotypes.

        I hereby apologize to each and every tie wearing person that I
unwittingly insulted. But I seldom see politicians that *don't* wear ties.
I'm not talking about the stiffs that do the work, I'm talking about the
bums that make the laws. *They're* the  ones that say I can't import a
MexiBus. End of story (and post).

Peace,
