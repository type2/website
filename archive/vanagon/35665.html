&gt;My 1976 type II has some approx 1/4&quot; OD tubing that runs up and back in the
&gt;cooling air intakes (the vents on the side of the body behind the side 
&gt;windows). These have about 3/4&quot; x 6&quot; long 'swellings'  up in the 
&gt;cooling air intakes. They come down into the engine compartment, and
&gt;turn into plastic tubing, join a T fitting just above the engine back door
&gt;hinges. The output of the T fitting has about 3&quot; of plastic tubing
travelling
&gt;forward along the ceiling of the engine comparment. The end of this tubing
is
&gt;melted, and there is no sign of the rest of this tubing? I don't know where
&gt;the
&gt;other ends of these two 'loops' of tubing goes?
&gt;What are they? What do they do? I assume they are some part of a pollution 
&gt;control? The van runs fine without them going anywhere?

Answered a while ago.  The tubes are the fuel vapor recovory vents from the
gas tank.  There was a carbon canister at the top or on the side of your
engine compartment close to where the tee is.  The lines go up the sides of
the engine compartment so that fuel can not siphon in to the compartment if
the tank gets over filled.
