I hate to burst a bubble here but I don't think you can transfer these
things.  They are mailing them out to the people on their mailing list
according to their last name or something.  That is why there is that 
short time for use.  This was talked about over on VintagVW and I 
think this was the conclusion.  You could, however, have Martha order 
the stuff for you, etc.  Mine is sitting here going to waste.  Too bad
I can't transfer it to about a month from now.  :(
