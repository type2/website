Subject: ?Propane Refridgerator Starting

Vanamaniacs,

        I'm sure I saw tips on firing the propane refridgerator in a Westy
Camper but, I can't find url. So, help me out here folks. Anybody got
pointers for me. Van's almost ten years old and I don't think it has ever
been used.

        While I'm at it can anyone share insights into filling my propane
tank. VW manual leaves much to be disired.

Pz and luv!         R.
