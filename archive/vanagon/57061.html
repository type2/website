----------
&gt;&gt;My wife likes the 1986 Vanagon much better
&gt; &gt; as a kid-hauler.  Too bad there's nothing to replace them currently. 
Even
&gt; &gt; the new VW's are not an option, as she refuses to consider automatics.
&gt; 
&gt; 	There should be plenty of 93 EVs with the 5-speed stick out there
&gt; on the used market.  I know
&gt; there's at least one.  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; And I agree, automatic is not an option. It's a sentence.
&gt; 
&gt; --Drew
&gt; 95 EV-C (Beulah), with a stick.
&gt; &amp; fondly remembering 93 EV (Stella) with a stick.

	I don't have munchkins, but I've been in a few minivans with'em.

	I've thought for quite a while, if I did have kids, I'd want a Eurovan MV
VR6 with
	the weekender package (poptop, cooler, mid-rig table).
