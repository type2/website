Subject: UniRoyal Laredo C rated 195x75 ?
Date: Thu, 16 Nov 95 10:24:18 PST

My local costco has this tire 2ply sidewall, 4ply tread, C rated, max pressure
50PSI at ~60$ each.  

The questions for net.vw.wisdom are:

1.  ennybody running these shoes?  How do you like em and on what bus are they?

2.  What would the rolling diameter difference be between 205/70 MXL$$$ and 
    195x75.  

The intended use is a mostly on road syncro westie.

Derek?, Harry?, Syncrohead? whats the poop?

It is my understanding that the 205/70 MXL reinforced is NLA, BTW.
