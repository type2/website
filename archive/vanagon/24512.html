The Thread That Never Dies ... :)

was watching a bit of &quot;The Scout&quot; on cable tonight, and this baseball scout
is down somewhere in mexico/central america, riding on a big school bus with
about 900 other people/goats/chickens, etc. anyway, it's a narrow two-lane
road (see Copleys' Trip Reports for further descriptions), and this red
Mexican VW Bus, complete with water cooled engine (cause it had this great
big radiator grill up front!), decides to pass the school bus ... but there
is this big truck coming in the other direction.

ever seen three lanes of traffic on a two-lane road??? :)  the vw bus got
away safely.

&lt;it's about 30-45 minutes into the movie&gt;
