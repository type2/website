It seems strange that your lights dim.  Mine have the relay that turns 
them off when I'm starting the bus.
     
&gt;      a) Is this fix considered permanent?
&gt;      b) Since the presumed culprit is the wiring!?, wouldn't replacing 
&gt;         the wiring harness be a good idea? Why can't I find a wiring
&gt;         harness advertised for this year model? [Or where can I find one].

I don't think a wring harness is going to help.  Consider
checking/replacing the ground cables, and positive cables.  Don't
forget the ground cable on the tranny.  You might also consider a
starter relay like some of the other people on the list have used. 
&gt;From the sound of it, the relay would help you problem, but cleaning 
up the connections never hurts.
