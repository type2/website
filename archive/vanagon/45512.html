Subject: Re: Importing US vanagon to Europe.

For importing cars to Germany:

1. to avoid import taxes you have to have been in the US for at least one
year, and owned the vehicle for at least 6 months.

2. the car has to pass technical inspection (TUV) and smog inspection.

3. the car has to be modified to german standards - mainly front and rear
lights and instrumentation (km/h)

4. if that exact car/engine combination is not available (therefore unknown)
to the german TUV, then engine output, max. vehicle speed and noise level
(inside and outside, idle and certain speed) have to be determined since
they will be stated in the german title

5. if (in this case) it is a camper with propane tank, the whole propane
system has to be visually checked whether it meets german standards and
pressure-checked whether it is safe

6. US-campers are equipped for 110V/60Hz external power (and the US
connectors), this would have to be changed to german system (220V/50Hz) and
connectors

Conclusion: too much hassle and $$$
