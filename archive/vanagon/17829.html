&gt; So has anyone ever had any good results with this stuff
&gt; on your windshield?

I recently put some of it on my Vanagon's windshield,
I thought it was cool :)  It's fun to watch the the water bead up and
run, scared, up the windshield.
It's great for me because at highway speeds, tha wipers hydroplane
across the surface of the water, not doing much more than stirring
it up a bit.
