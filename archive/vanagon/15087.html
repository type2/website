Subject: Re: 1985 Transmissin'


&gt;&gt;Last fall, (about 5000 miles ago) my '85 transmission (130,000) mi started
&gt;&gt;acting really weird, it became, almost instantly, very difficult to change
&gt;&gt;some gears, particularly third to fourth, and second to third.  I thought it
&gt;&gt;was linkage and adjusted, but that did not help.  My trusty mechanic (factory
&gt;&gt;trained) thought the tranny might be going, but decided to change the gear
&gt;&gt;oil, and put in a Slick 50 like lubricant.  This helped considerably, and
&gt;&gt;now, when the engine is warm, the tranny almost feels normal.  The tranny
&gt;&gt;does not grind, or pop out of gear.I have thought about finding one with a
&gt;&gt;dead engine and a good trans and swapping, but now don't think I need to.

&gt;&gt;Questions:  Has this happened to anybody else, or does anybody know what
&gt;&gt;it is?

&gt;&gt;I'm told transmissions are pretty good on this bus.  Anybody else had to
&gt;&gt;replace one?

&gt;&gt;Are the interior shift forks visible and accessible by just dropping the
&gt;&gt;trans, or do you have to do a full rebuild.

     The tranny on my '88 will not engage 3rd or 4th gear.It has 116k on it.I
     have yet to look at what the problem is. There are some metal shavings in
     the gear oil, and some are kinda gold colored, which indicates a stripped
     synchro and/or operating sleeve.I will be doing the rebuild myself, and
     will let you know what the results are. The interior shift forks are not
     really accessible without complete teardown.

     I did notice in the Bentley manual that there are revised part numbers for
     both the synchros and shift forks, so there must be some sort of problem.

     Also, the '80 Vanagon that I had spun a bearing on the 3rd/4th gear shaft
     at 122k. Only the one bearing failed, so I replaced it, the clutch, and all
     of the seals. It was working fine when I sold it several months later.

     Got a 70hp Johnson outboard (boat) engine to rebuild for a friend,my 1993
     (Hey-I've been busy--OK) and 1994 (maybe on time?)taxes, then it's tranny
     time!
