&gt;Actually I'm curious to see if I am the only one weird enough to have a
&gt;name for my brick.  Actually I have a couple.

you ACTUALLY 'named' your car? a machine with a name? oh, goodness! oh, how
verry verry stwange!!!! why NOBODY in their right minds would do such a
thing; at least NO ONE on THIS list would ELVER think of it !!!    ;)

&gt;1  Bright Green Pleasure Machine
&gt;2  Can a bus
&gt;3  Pea Green Boat
&gt;4  Hippie Wagon

however, i think i might have actually HEARD of OTHER people doing something
like this: Scuzzy Bus, Humpback, Gus, Blue Goose, Otto (for the Otto-Bahn),
White Efelant, Matilda (she take me money and she run away ...), ...

&gt;Maybe Joel could add this to his database of bricks

nope. no way. uh-uh. nein. nyet. no habla gringo.
