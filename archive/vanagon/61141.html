Subject: Repair, replace, or burn the thing!

If you knew someone (I won't say who.) who owned an 85 camper (with 135K on
it) that was blowing exhaust into the coolant, would you advise him/her to-
A)Replace the heads(again) and wonder how long the fix will last!
B)Install a rebuilt engine and wonder how long before the new engine leaks
exhaust too!
C)Burn the thing!

In other words, how can I achieve a fuzzy, warm feeling that I can get
where I'm  going in the old bucket of bolts without the aid of a tow truck?
