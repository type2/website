Subject: RE: 911 engine conversions


	With the additional power, it seems that it would be a good idea 
to increase the handling and braking of the van.  Is it possible to use 
911 brakes?  Is there an aftermarket source for vanagon suspention 
similar to that of the bug, golf and such?  Are there any C rated 60 
series 8 inch wide tyres (ha ha) for the Westies?  Sway bars or springs.
	I can imagine everything I own flying from side to side in the 
back of my van as I zoom through the twisties after those nasty BMW's 
(well this tends to happen now so how much worse could it get?)
	At least from a safty point, it would be a good idea to make the 
van's handling comparible to the engine.
