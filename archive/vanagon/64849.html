Subject:      15&quot; Vanagon rims?? (fwd)

     HI ALL, need to take my mine off things:

     Well in about 3 months I'm looking for new tires, so
     I think I might update to 15&quot; rims for my Syncro. My question?

     1 - What rims will bolt on with no Modifications?
         Audi? Mercades Benz?

     2 - What if any change to ride or preformance is changed?

     3 - Anyone make this change and have any other problems?

               Thanks Listies     ERic
