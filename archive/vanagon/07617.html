	Re: Chevy 'saddle' gas tanks: Actual experience with them is
NO WORSE than other (Ford, Dodge) location, within the perimiter frame.
Therefore, although I voted for Clinton and largely approve of him,
I feel this issue is b.s. and an actual example of Big Government
telling people what to do. Frankly, I've seen more big american
pickup trucks at the side of the road with a failed drive-shaft
than I have seen T-boned: The thought of the drive-shaft flailing around
in the general area of the fuel tank isn't very pretty- that's a one-
car accident, unless the fireball envelops passers-by.

	Mind you, I consider GM no friends of mine. But the gas tank
thing is pure posturing without content. This 'cure' is worse than
the problem.
