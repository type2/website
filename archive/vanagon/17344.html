&gt;      Now you must have heard about my mate that's puttin' the 911T in his

&gt;      We had to make some adapter bushes for the tranny spigot the other 
&gt;      day. He is putting the engine onto a 5-speed bus tranny with hydraulic 
&gt;      clutch. He had to get a bus flywheel redrilled to bolt to the Porshe 
&gt;      crank. The engine is as good as in now and uses Type III (I think) 
&gt;      engine mounts at the rear sides on to a plate that bolts onto the rear 
&gt;      of the engine. Oh, by the way he put a '74 chassis onto the bus body!


  Yes, I remember you saying about your mate. Sounds like a talented guy.
  Is he sticking with the '74 drums on the rear or going for after market
  discs? I'd always thought if I ever actually got round to making my
  dream bus (21/23 windows+Porsche power+ball joint front end etc etc etc
  yawn got no ideas of your own son?) it would probably need some uprating 
  in the brake department to say the least :)

  Going for the bay window chassis is a very neat way of getting round
  any steering &amp; suspension limitations that the splittie might have 
  when fitted with such a big motor.

  Look foward to seeing it around the shows; Any idea when?

  cheers
