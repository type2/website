Subject: Re: EV Battery goes out with a BANG!!!

Hmmmm....sounds like the conversation I had with VW regarding my coolant 
leak.  They refused to help me in any way.  Apparently, since I don't 
have a history of spending money at the dealer, I'm not worthy of an 
courtesy with respect to a defect.  

So, as far as VW is concerned, a defect is only a defect if they're 
legally responsible for correcting the defect, even if they've explicitly 
acknowledged that the defect exists in general.  I've never purchased a new 
vehicle, but this sort of response from VW makes me wary of the possibility.

So much for a sense of commmunity....
