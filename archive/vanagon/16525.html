Subject: window seals?

  As I finally have a few extra dollars, I was just wondering what the
consensus is on window seals. Is WCM definately the way to go? Anyone
have problems with them? I am not as concerned with price, as I would
rather pay a few extra dollars for something better that would last
longer. I am looking specifically for windshield seals for a '67 split
BTW. Thanks
Richard
