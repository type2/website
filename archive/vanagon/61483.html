All,
for what it's worth, years ago, I used to make these liners (for 7 years) I
have no problem believing this. The static that builds up in the type of
plastic that they used would curl your hair. MUCH stronger then the ones we
all used to get our siblings with after rubbing your feet on the carpet,...
Reminds me of last weekend, I pulled off to fill up and some woman was
standing at the pump next to me, pumping her gas, with a lit cig in her
mouth. I went on to the next station down the road without stopping. It's
the OTHER people you have to watch, they'll get you killed right along with
their dumb-asses.

&gt; 
&gt; Been catching up on the weekend posts.  Took me until Tuesday!
&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of gasoline, I saw a notice at one of my local gas 
&gt; stations that, while not of much direct VW interest, it may be for 
&gt; those with malfunctioning gas guages, odometers, forgetfull, etc.
&gt; (you know, those situations that require getting additional gasoline 
&gt; into you stranded vehicle, not that I&quot;VE ever had this problem =8-0
&gt; 
&gt; There is a real potential for fires caused by filling gas cans while 
&gt; tha cans are in a plastic bed liner in a truck (I suppose the same 
&gt; could be true for those newer plastic station wagon liners too).
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently the plastic bed liner can attain a sufficient static 
&gt; electrical potential that the act of filling a gas can placed on the 
&gt; plastic liner can initiate a spark, and boom, gas fire.
&gt; 
&gt; DO NOT FILL GAS CANS IN THE BED OF A TRUCK WITH A 
&gt; PLASTIC BED LINER
&gt; 
&gt; According to the article (no reference to source unfortunately) 
&gt; 23 people have died or been maimed as a direct result of doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who may think this is a hoax, I firmly believe that the 
&gt; scientific reasoning behind this situation is believeable, and it 
&gt; can't hurt to fill the can on the ground.  Better safe than sorry.
&gt;

&gt; While it may not be a loss to the VW world to lose a few non-VW 
&gt; trucks, it would be a shame to lose a VW owner in the process ;-) or 
&gt; a neighboring VW at the gas station!
