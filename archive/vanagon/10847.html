Subject:       '85 Westy Weekender for sale...

Well, I'm selling my van.  As y'all may recall, I bought an '87 Westy 
to replace it.  I've got a few interested local parties so I don't 
expect to sell it to anyone on the list but if someone just HAS to 
have it and the local deals fall thru maybe we can talk.  Here's the 
details:

'85 Weekender, AT, AC, PS, AM/FM/CASS Wolfsburg edition
~117,000 miles
1.9L 

the Bad--
-heads drip but not bad to live with
-small ATF fluid leak, drips but little fluid loss
-several body dings, slight surface rust on some seams
-in the past, has needed a crank seal about every 14,000 miles.  I 
just replaced this and everything is dry.  the dealer feels this is 
due to the open-to-the-air design of the AT bellhousing allowing dust 
(I live on about 1.66 mi of gravel road).  i don't know what is 
causing this honestly.  one reader suggested bad main bearing but the 
engine is quiet and really runs smooth. 
-rear brake shoes have NOT been replaced but brakes seem fine
-interior (tan corduroy) is worn on drivers seat and on top of the 
armrests, otherwise excellent
-oil light flickered at hot idle with Fram filter, flickers 
completely gone with VW filter and Castrol Synthetic 5-50

the Good:
-NEW exhaust except for converter
-FRt disks and pads replaced
-Interstate battery in '90
-Bosch rebuilt starter in 93(?)
-additional battery cable added on + side
-many new maintenance items ie plug wires, cap, rotor, filters and i 
forget what else
-water pump replaced
-cv joints done once
- really runs quite well, I think i've kept up with the niggling 
little stuff that's always happening

I'm going to be asking $4,600 which may be a tad high but this is the 
last van like this the dealership has sold since I bought it many 
years ago.  If I don't sell it here I will negotiate on the price.

General Comments and Guffaws Welcome!
