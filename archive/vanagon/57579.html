Here's the brief rundown of US model types:

1993 CL - Base model, 7 passenger - 3 in rear, two in middle, 2 in front
	GL - Mid-price model - 7 passenger, seating as above
	MV - &quot;MultiVan&quot;, 7 passenger - 3 in rear seat (which folds to make 
bed), 2 in rear facing jump seats, two in front. Comes with curtains, table 
and flourescent light...sort of a minimal camper
	MV Weekender - same as MV, but with pop top and &quot;Six pack&quot; cooler 
under one of the jump seats.

1995-? EuroBago - Winnebago conversion of long wheel base EV. (the above 
models are short wheel base EVs)
