Subject: Pop top popping solution (?)

Hi everyone,

I think I found a solution to the top popping problem for 68-72 Westies with
the pop top hinged in the front.  I'm planning on doing some long distance
driving next week and I know that &lt;THUNK&gt; sound that the pop top makes as it
shifts into it's undesired position will just drive me crazy on the highway.
Yesterday I removed the clip that is fixed to the roof just above the
windshield (by two 10mm bolts).  I noticed something I hadn't before.  Just
above the inner curved portion of this clip that accepts the curved &quot;arm&quot;
from the pop top, there is a stamped &quot;hump&quot; in the aluminum that appears to
serve the function of allowing the arm connected to the pop top to just pass
by the hump and then &quot;lock&quot; below it.   The hump on mine is just barely
noticeable, but it appears to have been worn down as there are vertical wear
marks suggesting how it was smoothed out over the years.  When the clip is
viewed from the front you can see the only remaining evidence of the
stamping--the oval depression of the stamp mark.

It seems that the best way to fix this is to add some material to the clip
to recreate the hump.  I don't have the facilities to mess with molten
metal, so I wrapped some electrical tape around the clip where the hump was
and cut a strip of thin aluminum sheet to fit the complete inner and outer
contour of the clip and protect the electrical tape.  This simulated hump
probably won't last long but it will probably do for the short term.  Once I
get a spare clip I'll get someone to add some material to it and let you
know the results.
