Subject: re August campbash

&gt;If we make this August campbash as far north as somewhere near
&gt;Eureka, would any list members from Oregon/Washington be
&gt;interested in attending?  This is btw for the weekend of
&gt;August 25, 26, 27.
&gt;

Maybe. Depends upon different things - I've been thinking of hauling the mtb
over to North Cascades sometime in late August, but might be inclined to
haul it down there too. Wait though, it's not &quot;hemp harvest&quot; time down there
is it - not sure if I want to be in the woods if it is!
Of course, if you were to move it further north, say southern Oregon, I'd be
more inclined...
