  The flasher relay on the earlier bay windows, is a pain to 
  get hold of, and twice the price of the later version too! 
  However, that big relay box actually contains two smaller
  relays and a number of components. When mine gave up the
  ghost I pulled it apart and resoldered/replaced some bits,
  and it clicks away quite nicely.               
  Might be worth a go, you've nothing to loose..
