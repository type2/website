Subject: Cheapest source for Bentley for '67???

Howdy all, as we are hitting the road this summer, I figured it's about time I
caved in and spent the bucks for the Bentley manual for '63-'67 busses. I know
it's going to be expensive, but I was just wondering if anyone had a cheap
source for them, or knew of the best place to get them. I called the Bentley
publishers, BTW, and they quoted a pretty darn high price as well...
Sigh...
Thanks,
Richard
