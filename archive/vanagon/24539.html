Subject: Re: Surf Trip Report

&gt;
&gt;Just got back from surfing.  Execellent waves!  Almost head high this AM,
&gt;getting smaller and closer to the beach as the tide came in.
&gt;
&gt;Used about 6 gallons of gas to get there.  Still have to do the math to
&gt;see if thats good or not.  Averaged 70 PH down there, tho.
&gt;
&gt;Passed the Muir dipstick test when I got to the beach
&gt;
&gt;When I got back, I stuck the meat thermometer in the oil hole, unloaded
&gt;some stuff, came back and checked.  GASP!  The thermo had _wrapped_ around
&gt;past 200 and came to rest at 80!  What!?  Yikes!  Let it cool a bit,
&gt;and then looked at the thermo.  At ambient temp (80 something) it real 160!
&gt;D'oh!  Time for a new thermometer!

&gt;   Thom...why don't you order a Gene Berg dip stick thermo.?  They are cheap,
    very accurate and connect to your oil light.._dot_causing it to flicker when
    the temp. starts to get high (225-227 degrees).  The part # is GB227a-228
    depending on year of bus.  Gene Berg is at (714) 998-7500
