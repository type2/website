This past weekend in a temporary fit of wannabusitis, I purchased a 1982 
Vanagon for parts.  Getting it home was pretty uneventful, although with 
a stuck lifter it was bucking and fading on the slightest grades.  Seems 
it was sitting idle for a year or so and didn't run so hot when the PO 
fired it up.  He took it to the local VW repair place where they replaced 
the plug wires and added some cutting oil (or something) to help pump up 
the lifter (if it was indeed the lifter).  So about half way home the bus 
starts running a little better and by the time we pulled in the driveway, 
it would even idle.

My $400 got me:

1982 Vanagon automatic, pretty good body, left rear quarter dented
Bentley manual
factory AC, cruise, 4 speaker cassette, aux. gas heater
2.0L w/20-25000 miles on rebuild (possible stuck valve)
2 good M&amp;S tires

I'll be using the short block in the short term as well as most of the 
stuff listed above, with the exception of the AC.  Anyone who missed out 
on Bradley's bus can email if interested in parts.

Paul
