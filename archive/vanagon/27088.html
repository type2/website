&gt; other drivers, and some area where I used a Scotch-brite pad to get some
&gt; crap off (don't EVER do this!)

Actually I'd like to interject on Scotch Brite's behalf, these things
are however simply great for finish sanding areas that are evil contours
prior to painting, nooks crannies, curves, door jambs, window frames,
etc.  People discovered this and now 3M sells pads particularly for the
purpose but frankly your average good quality dishwashing pad provides
a great useable alternative.  Typically gives scratches somewhere
between 240 and 320 grit, and does not break up like steel wool.
However they are NOT resistant to most solvents.
