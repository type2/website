Subject: Re: Drain plug problems

&gt;4) something else I haven't thought of.
&gt;
&gt;Solutions:
&gt;I'm going to reinstall the plug bolt using a nylon washer, which should
&gt;form a better seal than the copper ones that VW has been giving me. The
&gt;washer is made for this kind of application, so it should be OK.
&gt;If it still doesn't work, I have a rubber expansion bolt as Bob described
&gt;in his sermonette (thank you Bob!). I hate to use a solution like that (it
&gt;_seems_ like such a temporary measure), but it'll do until I find a better
&gt;solution.
&gt;
&gt;Possible original causes of my problem (what did I do wrong):
&gt;1) I don't think I used too much torque on the bolt during my oil changes,
&gt;but since I haven't used torque wrenches to tighten this bolt, I can't
&gt;really claim any exact torque figures. I tend to use a six inch socket
&gt;wrench and hold it close to the neck. I'd say I tightened it to 15-18 ft.
&gt;lbs. at most, but that guesstimate's worth zip in the absence of an actual
&gt;measurement.
&gt;2) (this is the biggie) You may gasp in horror at my stupidity, but I'd
&gt;always been taught to warm up the engine a little to get any gunk up into
&gt;the oil (so it drains out with the oil). I'd always wondered about this,
&gt;but it always worked. However, warming up an aluminum engine and then
&gt;pulling a bolt out of a warm crankcase may win me new honors in the
&gt;&quot;no-brainer&quot; department--literally. This theory may be supported by the
&gt;fact that the bolt stripped coming out of the case--not going back in.
&gt;3) I've been using new copper washers, but Bob's sermonette reminded me of
&gt;the old crushable washers I used to use on my 412's (Type IV engines in
&gt;Type IV bodies--what a concept). Maybe these washers contributed to my
&gt;problem, although they are what's sold at the dealer. I haven't seen the
&gt;crushable kind for years around here.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmmm.
&gt;Hope this helps someone on the road to a similar mistake,

Hi Dave,
   I wanted to add my 2 cents about you drain plug problems.  First  Don't
use two copper gaskets.  It defeats to gaskets purpose for sealing
properly.  I have to agree with Jack Reed as far as warming the engine.  It
does supended the contaninates in the oil so they can be drained out. Plus
Jack makes a good point about heili coils.  Makes new steal threads that
are left in the case so you shouldn't have that problem again.  I work in a
GM dearlership and Most of my duties include oil changes.

To everyone else:
    Becareful on those type 4 motors.  If you decide to change the pick-up
screen, don't over tighten the bolt that holds the plate in place.  If you
do you'll break the case where the bolt threads in and you'll need
expensive engine work.=(
