Subject: VW-Vanagon Mailing List Split?
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 95 12:40:53 PDT
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

I realize this might sound like heresy to some, and flame bait to others,
but has there ever been any consideration to splitting the &quot;vanagon&quot; list
into air-cooled and water-logged versions?  I know that many of the volks
have both types of busses but they could subscribe to both lists.  I also
know that much of the advice about camper accessories, proper tools,
engine fire stories, etc. may be of interest to both groups but that's
what cross-posting is for.  I guess I'm being selfish as it is tough to
wade through page after page of wasserbox mail to find anything to do
with my '71 Bus but....

Your thoughts and flames are invited....
