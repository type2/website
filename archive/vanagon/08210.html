Hi,
	I just had a thought:  Since there has been some discussion of
the types of things that are posted to this list, maybe we could insert
a small token into the header for posts that are non-VW related so those
people that are getting overwhelmed by mail could sort through it a little
easier.  I was thinking we could put [f] at the end of the topic to
identify the post as for &quot;fun&quot;.  What do you all think?  I for one read
all posts to this list - I wouldn't miss them!  I just thought that this
might be something that would make a few more people happy.  Or maybe it's
just these painkillers going to my head...
