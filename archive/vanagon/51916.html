I've finally gotten the money together to buy a different vehicle.  I
would love to have a Vanagon Synchro with locking diff, but I would also
consider a Toyota 4wd van or any 4wd van.  

I live in NC, but I'm going to be travelling all over the country on
interviews during late December and January.

Thanks for the info!

Ed Jones
