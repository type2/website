Subject: more questions

oh yeah, the brakes, they have a vacum booster, right? where is the 
connection to this? and when i press brake pedal, i hear a sucking 
sound..oi presume this is normal for it not having the vaume line hooked 
up at engine..

looking down from top of engine, there is this little gadget to pass side 
of engine at front. it has large &lt;vacume line size&gt; nipple on top, and 
fuel line size nipple on rear side. what is this?


of cours, i could ask what all these wires are for, but i wont..


thanks again..
