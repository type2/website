Subject: Re: Lighter tyres for lighter steering?

On a personal note: I recently switched from a &quot;C&quot; load range passenger
Yokohama 205/70R-14 (inflated to max psi 36lbs)to a Uniroyal
LT195/75R-14 (inflated to vehicle specs) and noticed a slightly stiffer
ride, but little or no difference in steering force ('85 GL w/power
steering)

	when I bought my '82 L it has Michelin XZX 185R-14R (reinforced)
	(no power steering) when I drove it home from POs' it felt like a
Truck... upon checking tire pressures, I found about 17-22 psi all
around ( Van had been sitting for 1 1/2 yrs...)

	Upon correct inflation to door sticker specs, Handing improved
immensely and steering effort decreased ( now it is almost as easy as
the '85...)
