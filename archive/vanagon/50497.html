Subject: Re: Fuel gauge oddities in EV MV

I found a temporary fix.  Simply smack the dash right above the gauges 2
or 3 times.  That tends to make mine work for up to a week.  Honestly, I
would like to know of a definite fix also.  But the smacking really worked
for me.

&gt; My buddy has a '93 EV MV that gives him erronious fuel level 
&gt; readings.  If I recall there were several others that had the same 
&gt; problem.  Is the answer in the vault of knowledge {archives}?  If so, 
&gt; I forget how to get into the archives;  if not, my bud needs your 
&gt; help.
