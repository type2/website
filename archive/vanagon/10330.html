Subject: Re: The case of the missing brake fluid.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;another weirder answer to the missing brake fluid could be that the BRAKE
&gt;&gt;master is leaking into the booster, hence the dissapearing fluid.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyone???

This is highly likely. My old volvo 264 had this illness once. I first noticed
that brake fluid was low. Filled up and then went low again in a couple of weeks.
Eventualy the car did not want to stop when I commanded it to. The booster was
identified to be failing. So I replaced it and found that there was some liquid
in it and I believe it wanted to tell me it was stuffed with brake fluid.
