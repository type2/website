Subject: Re: Go with the door sticker.....

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The door sticker on my '88 Westy says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For 185r14 REINFORCED tires: 30/40 psi front/rear
&gt; &gt; For 195/75r14 6PR LT tires: 39/48 psi front/rear
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So you ARE ok with 40 psi if they are REINFORCED. If they don't say
&gt; &gt; it, they probably aren't (and should not be used).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; btw: I ran my re-inf. tires at max pressure all round, as they were
&gt; &gt; too soft. I now run LT load range C/D tires at 39-50 psi depending on
&gt; &gt; conditions and loading.

&gt; The 48 PSI sticker on your Westy is for the original equipment
&gt; Continental Transporter tires with reinforced sidewalls.  Thank your
&gt; luck stars you no longer have them on your van.  They were by far the
&gt; worst handling tires I ever had, especially in the rain.

Actually, I still have one as a spare, although I can't tell if it's 
original. (looks like it). Pretty primitive tread design, almost like 
a bias ply summer tire. But I think it is an &quot;LT&quot; tire, as it says 6 
ply rating load range C on it. I have yet to see a *good* continental 
tire after about 5 different types over the years...
