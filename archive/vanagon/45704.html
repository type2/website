Subject: '74 CARBS WITH 009

I AM CURRENTLY REBUILDING THE CARBS ON MY MACHINE AND HAVE NOTICED SOME
DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO THE MAIN JET NUMBERS BETWEEN THE LEFT AND RIGHT
CARBS. IT SEEMS THE PO HAS &quot;MIXED AND MATCHED&quot; CARBS FROM DIFFERENT YEARS.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A BIG DEAL AS FAR AS I CAN SEE EXCEPT FOR THE MAIN
JET SIZE.  DOES ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT JET SIZE WORKS BEST WITH THE
STOCK DUAL SOLEX CARBS AND THE 009 DISTRIBUTOR ON A '74 BUS??  I'M ALSO
LOOKING FOR ANY TIPS ON WHAT STATIC TIMING SETTING IS BEST FOR THIS SET UP.
I'M GOING TO START WITH 0 DEGREES AND THEN ADVANCE UNTIL I JUST AVOID THE
PINGING.  ANY THOUGHTS OR SUGGESTIONS?

THANKS IN ADVANCE,
