You just bought the wrong year....My '71 cost me peanunts to run.  The last
rebuilt 1600 INSTALLED cost $800.  Granted it's not great for long trips(no
power)but for putting around the city on a day to day basis and short day
trips it's wonderful. When I get a little money ahead I'll pull this engine and 
put in a 1776 with weber progressive carb. and then I should have the perfect
bus.

&gt;I purchased my 84 van from the origanal owner.  He took great care in his
&gt;vehical, as do I.  This van has 164k miles on it.  Between the 2 of us
&gt;(mostly him).  We have over $17,000 in receipts since it was purchased.  If
&gt;it was any other vehical it would be a huge LEMON!.  But instead, everyone
&gt;always says &quot;It's a Vanagon.&quot;.  The heads have been replaced twice, 12/92
&gt;and 12/94.  Here I am in 12/95 and I have to spend another $2,000 on
&gt;rebuilding the whole engine, including new heads again.  
&gt;Yes, I love my Van but... Don't it tick you off to think that for over 10
&gt;years in just the &quot;water boxer&quot; alone, VW has been snowing the public with
&gt;an inferior product.  I'm trying to replace my rear heater core for the 3rd
&gt;time in this van.  I called a whole bunch of junk yards to find a used one.
&gt;Every single one of the 19 that was located, leeked.  Ya think there's a bit
&gt;of a poor quality issue here? Of all the people on this group alone.  I
&gt;would say %99 of everyone with a watercooled van has had head problems or is
&gt;anticipating one.  Unless you change your break pads before there's metel on
&gt;metel you'll have to get new roters because there so thin they can't be
&gt;resurfaced safley.  How about the ever-so-popular leaking windshield.  Well
&gt;at least after my rebuild maybe my cooling system will be bled right.
&gt;Thank goodness for AAA.
&gt;As Meatloaf said in, Bat out of Hell II.  &quot;Life is a lemon and I want my
&gt;money back.&quot;
&gt;I feel better now.

&gt;&quot;Looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon
