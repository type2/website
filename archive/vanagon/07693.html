Subject: Re: Old busses and snow-a good mixture?

My Busses handle pretty well in the snow.  The 68
has a pr. of pretty substantial snow tires, and the
79 has a new set of Summit Trail Climbers that will
be tested for the first time today.  BTW, there's a
piano sounding board in the 79 yet, (I really didn't
make the piano move up...) so it has some extra weight.

Anyway, we have some fairly steep hills, and the Busses
manage to amaze folks with their ability to slog along.
