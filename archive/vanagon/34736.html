Subject: re:campers(was BRM wheels)

&gt;it has this tent on the roof ; Wedge-shaped, with tall end at the rear =
&gt;of the bus, runs from rear of bus to about the middle of the side =
&gt;doors... looks to be about 3 1/2' at the rear and a foot or so at the =
&gt;front... square zippered door right over the rear wheel... ladder hooks =
&gt;on rain gutter and rests on tire ( it may store up under the roof =
&gt;rack...) it also has a custom made tent/room that is hung over the rear =
&gt;hatch door when hatch is open...        =09
&gt;        I vaguely remember sleeping in this tent when I was about 11-12 ( =
&gt;mid-late 60s...)
&gt;
&gt;        Is this like a Rarest of the Rare for Buses....??

&gt;This is called a poptop, and the bus is a camper.  Westfalia, or something
&gt;similar if made by a different company.


No way, not a Westy, they had the small vertical pop-tops, standing room 
only, in those years.  Later pop-top was front hinged, at the windshield, 
not mid way back, and definately no square door above the rear wheel.  
Sounds like no 'through roof' access.  Get those pix scanned for posterity.
