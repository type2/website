Subject:      The WetWesties mailing list

For the Pacific NW list members:
        There is a new list &quot;for the discussion of upcoming trips and events by
a group of Pacific Northwest EuroVan, Vanagon and bus owners&quot;.
It has been (wisely) called &quot;The WetWesties&quot; mailing list. To suscribe,
please go to Ron Lussier's Vanagon website (http://vanagon_dot_com/)
So, from now on, let's try to do our camping organization in the
mentioned list, before some eastcoaster gets mad _at_ us for using too much
bandwith on this...
Cris.
Eugene, OR.
'91 Westie &quot;Fafner&quot;
'66 Kombi
'67 Deluxe (parts bus)
