Subject: 87 syncro: replacing exhaust components

I'll be replacing the exhaust components on my syncro in the next year or
so, from the heads to the muffler. Bentley doesn't show it, but I've heard
that the crossover pipe is specific to the syncro and very difficult to
locate. Can one of you syncro owners confirm/deny this? Also, can you
suggest sources for these exhaust parts other than VWoA? Thanks...
