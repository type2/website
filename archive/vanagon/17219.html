Subject: Re: 1984 Westfalia
From: jcunning_at_snow.win_dot_net (John H. Cunningham)

 Having removed the fridge from my '90 Vanagon at least 20 times I
have finally figured out how to keep it working. You can get an
instruction booklet for free by calling Dometic's 800 #. (get
number from operator). It explains how to remove the fridge and
replace parts...but not how to fix it. The common problem is ashes
in the burner chamber. They fall down from the flue when I travel
on washboard roads. Clean them out, and the jet orifice, with
alcohol. Be sure the igniter sparks to the burner, and not to the
thermocouple.  
 
  
&gt;I have an opportunity to
&gt;purchase a 1983 Westfalia and
&gt;I am soliciting any
&gt;opinions on it or any
&gt;general comments, positive
&gt;or negative.  I have the car
&gt;for a week now.  The brakes
&gt;feel soft to me so I&quot;m going
&gt;to have them checked out.
&gt;Also, I don't believe the
&gt;refrigerator is working.  I
&gt;wonder if it's repairable.
&gt;
&gt;Please respond to me
&gt;privately at
&gt;fred_at_caliban.ucsd_dot_edu or
&gt;fred_at_pooh.ucsd_dot_edu
&gt;as I'm not signed on to
&gt;the list  --- yet.
&gt;
&gt;If there's interest in a
&gt;summary of the comments,
&gt;I will post one.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks very much,
&gt;Fred Julilan
