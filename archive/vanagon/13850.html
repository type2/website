&gt; David S. I tried using netscape on your papaya.nosc_dot_mil but was told to
&gt; provide ID. Is it an anonymous logon? Thanks - DC

We have been having some problems with httpd and access permissions.  We
think it has been fixed now.  If you go to:

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil

you will get the home page for the project I am working on.  To get to my
personal homepage (not much there) you need to go to:

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze

and to get to my VW page:

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw


Sorry for the confusion...
