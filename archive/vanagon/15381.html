I haven't done this because my sliding door isn't very loud, but it came
to mind that you could do the old lube thing and then with the door off,
paint a layer of that goop that you can soak tool handles in on the bottom
track and let it dry. (This is the rubbery stuff that you can dip your
tool handles in to make them rubber coated) It's pretty hard and would
probably last a couple of years.  You might have to re-adjust your door a
little, but it should quiet the metal on metal sound of the roller on the
track.  Make sure it's good and dry before you put it on, and if you think
you'll have any left over, get some tools and do it now because that stuff
won't keep. 

Just an idea.  I've used this stuff for the metal feet of chairs, so it 
seemed  likely that it'd work.
