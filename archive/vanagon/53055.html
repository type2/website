Subject: Tansmission fluid and propex gas use

I have been having a bit of a grind going from 1st to 2nd gear when the
engine is cold. It seems to be smoother when warm. I was wondering if anyone
thought that a synthetic oil for the transmission and viscous coupling was a
good idea or not. Also I'm trying to decide how big of a propane tank I
should get to run my new propex heater. I'd like some suggestions
