&gt;Hello fellow Vanagonites ( or Vanagonians?),
...
&gt;Lastly, we need a name for Vanagon enthusiasts.  People without a bus have a
&gt;name (Wanabus) so people with a van should certainly have a name.  By the
&gt;way, I was kidding with Vanagonite and Vanagonian above.  I'd love to hear
&gt;whatever suggestions the list has to offer.

what? Busman, Ombusman, BusNut, Stupid-Filthy-Hippie ain't good enough
any more?? :)

hmmmmmm. Van-Goer?? VanMan?? (kinda sexist, eh?) Vanner? Bricker?
Wedgie?? :) (in some circles, the Vanagon/Caravelle/Transporter of the third
&quot;generation&quot; is known as a &quot;Wedge&quot;.  eh?)

Noganav? (vanagon, backwards). Cuber?? (cause the vanagons are more squared
off in body style .... where as the Bread-loaf drivers would be Loafers???
:) and the Microbus drivers would be Splitters. and the Eurovan drives would
be ... Rounders??)

Vanagoners?? or just Goners, for short.

oh, boy, another excuse for a super-sillious thread! :)
