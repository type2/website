Subject: RE: Hoo Boy! ('90 Transplant: Corrado Torque Data)

There is a nice discussion of rechipping the G60 engine at
http://www.thepoint_dot_net/~bwhite/corrado/faq/G60_Power_Upgrades.html

Bottom line: There are three Autothority mods discussed, 175HP, 201 HP, 
and 217HP. The 175 mod is CARB approved, important to me cause they
are building some horrendous new pollution testing stations in MD.
Torque data is presented, and in stock and modified engines, it 
peaks at 4000RPM. Just what the doctor ordered!
