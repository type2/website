&gt;  
&gt; &gt; 	The other wonderful idea along these lines would be to
&gt; &gt; find a drag strip and go on 'grudge' night- match-race vans, for
&gt; &gt; the slowest 1/4 miles they'd ever have recorded!
&gt; 
&gt; I always wanted to do that with our Vanagon just to see how fast (or slow)
&gt; it is but never got around to doing that.
&gt; 
The IVWA meets in Farmington NC let ANYONE make time trials on the 1/4
mile track. Not only do you get the lights and countdown, but they will
time you, and tell you your time and mph. I have seen some rather
sad-looking VW's taking off beside the super-racers. Kinda funny,
especially as a late model bus once won 2 rounds or so!
So, y'all all come to NC for the next farmington meet!
