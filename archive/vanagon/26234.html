&gt;Hi all,
&gt;	I was just wondering if there is any other way to remove that 
&gt;36mm gland nut (I think that's what it's called) which holds onto my 
&gt;flywheel besides using an impact driver.  What does everyone else use?  I 
&gt;need to switch mine with an automatic driveplate.  You see, I'm putting 
&gt;(well, trying to put) a '71 1600 DP (MT) into my '73 bus/camper (AT) 
&gt;because I want to drive it again.  Waaah! I want my bus.  The closest 
&gt;I've been to driving a bus lately was sitting in the '66 Westy as we 
&gt;towed it to my house, leaving a lot to be desired.  Hey, can anyone point 
&gt;me to some 6v to 12v conversion info?  Please.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;-Erik.

Erik,  i just removed the flywheel on my '74 1600 engine.  What you need to
do is get some sort of flywheel lock, consult Muir or J.C. Whitney sells
them for 6 bucks. After the flwheel is secured from spinning, then you get
you 4 foot cheater pipe and 36mm or 1 7/16&gt; socket with shorty extention and
breaker bar.  Have your friend or significant other hold the engine still
and you stand on or push slowly at the very end of the cheater pipe.  Mine
came off very easy but sometimes you'll (As Muir says hear a
big&quot;SSSCCCRRREEEEEEE&quot; sound as it unloosens.  After gland nut is off
carefully pry all around the flywheel and it will come off.  Mind those pins
though! Good Luck!!
