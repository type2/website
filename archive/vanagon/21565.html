Subject: Split window brakes

As I hit my brakes quite hard yesterday on the approach to the Bay Bridge
Maze (that's the intersection of I80, I580, I880, I980, Hwy 24, and a couple
of on-ramps thrown in for good measure all within about a mile - smart
design, no?) I once again wondered how hard it would be to put a dual master
cyl. in my '64 bus.  With the current (and original) system any failure
would not be fun.  I think the master has *never* been worked on!

Have any of you made any cool upgrades to the brakes and what work was required?

I guess air bags are out of the question at this point.

Thanks.
