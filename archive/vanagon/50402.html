&gt; I just changed the coolant to a Prestone non-phosphate &quot;looks like
&gt; orange syrup&quot; coolant.  It looked pretty appetizing ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I think I broke something because when I started the engine, the
&gt; temperature indicator rose very quickly while the LED sensor blinked
&gt; rapidly.  The temperature LED sensor has not yet stopped blinking, and
&gt; the indicator is all the way to the right (MAX temp) even though the
&gt; engine was cold.
&gt; 
&gt; What part do I need to replace?  There's a two female prong wire covered
&gt; with insulation that attaches to the coolant reservoir.  Is this what I
&gt; have to replace?  OR there is also an attachment onto the coolant water
&gt; reservoir itself.  Is this instead what I have to replace?  I think I
&gt; made a booboo because I did not disconnect the battery prior to changing
&gt; the coolant.  I wonder if not-disconnecting-the-battery was the cause of
&gt; the temperature indicator going up rapidly?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA!

John,

Your coolant light will blink if you do not have the proper mix of
coolant and water.  It will also blink if your fluid level is low.

Just a thought.
