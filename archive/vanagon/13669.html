Subject: Westy Flue Vent Cover

A friend of mine keeps breaking the flue vent cover of his westy.  VW gets
something like $20 for these, as I'm told.

Is there a cheaper source?

What do most folks do?  Just don't bother?

My friend works in plastics molding and has thought of making a flue vent
mold.  If he did, would his vents be a marketable item at, say, $10?

Thanks,

Jon
