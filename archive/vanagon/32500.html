Subject: Nashville to Ashville to Triangle

Well, a quick update as regards my 87 syncro westy with bigtime road trip
troubles...

Finnnnnnnnnally, after 4 hours of calling around in Nashville Mon. am, I
opted to get towed (flatbed, of course) to local dealer (Superior Motors).

By end of day, after an hour+ of looking at stuff (fuel pump pressure was
fine, and engine even acted semi-ok when idling in shop), it was clear that
the vehicle drove fine with the O2 sensor DISconnected. They didn't have the
part, so I chanced driving the few hundred miles into cold night to make it
to Asheville, NC w/ it disconnected. Next day, Tues, had the O2 sensor
replaced and stayed another night in mountains, apparently cured.

This morning, dumb move on dirt road (ice/mud) trying to let another guy past
with narrow passage, and I got stuck. First time putting syncro to test, and
its amazing what I almost pulled myself out of there... (needed a 4wd vehicle
with cable to pull me out tho). Upon drive to Durham by eve, things still
don't feel right. Acceleration is good, but gas mileage seems to have dropped
from 17mpg to 10!... and serious pulling to left and &quot;wobbles&quot; at 30-40mph.
Would like to get back to nyc and figure out problems from home....but geez,
strangeness continues, and I may look for shop here in Durham early tomorrow,
just to be safe...anyone got a recommendation?

BTW, thanks to those who responded earlier, over weekend.
