	Hi pholks.
This may be an answer to my own question regarding the curtains.  Saw a 
friends '70 in which he installed 1cm wide trim strips across the top of 
the ceiling just behind the front seats whith screws at the ends and the 
center only.  This made it possible for him to have two  normal curtains 
looped  on the trim wherin he could pull the two curtains to either side.
The curtains could be any length but only long enough to extend to the 
center.  Now that I think about in, it looks very similar to the curtains 
across the back window in my westy, except of course, the trim is 
bent to follow the arc of the roof.
	I had thought of the curtains which extend around the side and 
front window but since I am living in mine, I wanted something simple 
that I could open and close quickly. Thus also I had seen and scrubbed 
the idea of snaps for the center curtain.   The front of my westy has become 
the green house and storage area.
	I am going to try this perhaps next weekend and I will report my 
success and or failures.
