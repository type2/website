&gt;&gt;  For those that didn't see it, it looked like they just put a couple of  
&gt;&gt;  planks across two dugout canoes, rolled their bus onto the planks and 
&gt;&gt;  paddled the whole lot across a *large* river to the otherside. Amazing...

&gt;Okay, I take this as a challenge.  I say Martha 'Not to be out-done' Rubin
&gt;can put together a trip where we can actually traverse the Atlantic Pond to
&gt;the UK on pontoons!  Well Martha?  ;)

OK, got you all beat, I watched a French movie years ago about some people 
travelling across Africa in a Citroen 'Deux Cheveaux', tiny 2 cyl aircooled 
car.  They got caught in massive floods, not deep, but expansive.  With aid 
of the locals canoes they took the engine/trans and wheels across the 'lake' 
then wrapped the entire car in a huge canvas tarpaulin and towed it across, 
floating behind the canoes.  Land-Ho , Tim Smith
