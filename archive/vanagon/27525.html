&gt; Can I be the first to run with this one?

Too many leftover hydrocarbons.  Would probably ignite in the oven, then 
the firefighters, rather than being overcome by smoke inhalation in the 
normal sense would just lose interest and go looking for a 7-11 or a 
Taco Bell.  Better to start fresh.

&gt; -Many busses may already have spare fuel onboard!

Well yeah.  But then they'd go even slower than they do now!
