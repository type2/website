&gt; &gt; My wife and I just returned from a trip to Giorgia, Tennessee, Alabama
&gt; &gt; from Ontario, Canada. We drove the long stretches on Interstates (why is
&gt; &gt; the wind always head on?) and took lesser roads through all the
&gt; &gt; beautiful mountains we could find. The whole trip was 2960 miles and we
&gt; &gt; AVERAGED 20.76 miles/gallon (thats US gallon and US miles). Wow you guys
&gt; &gt; have good gas (92 to 94 octane of all brands).
&gt; &gt; More seriously, I think what made ALL THE DIFFERENCE was the INJECTOR
&gt; &gt; CLEANER I used three times allong the trip.

&gt;         I have definatley noticed this phenomenon many times.  Those tanks
&gt; with the fuel system claener (K44 or is it 44K) just seem to go on and on.
&gt; But when I figure in the cost of the additive, $20 or something
&gt; ridiculous, my cost per mile skyrockets...

We were using cheap injector cleaner ($6.00 for 5 applications) not
OCTANE BUSTER. The cost increase in minimal. A smooth running and
efficient engine is a happy engine so a small cost is worth it.
