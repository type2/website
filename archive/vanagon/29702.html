Subject: synchro EVs; head repaired and working fine

I saw some British magazine in a store the other day - it had pictures of
the T4 in its use as a work truck. Basically an  EV with an empty back,
just like the old American vans used to be. But more interestingly, they
had a description of a T4 Synchro model, listed at something like 18,000
British pounds.
I think these had the Turbo Injection Diesel engine in them, but I'm not sure.
How come they never shipped these over here? I'm guessing the price - that
should be the equivalent of US$31,500!
Put a Winnie shell on that and you're talking $40K retail.

The good news - all it took was a *really big* 'easy out' to get my spark
plug threads out of the head without damage. (I also found out that the
mechanic's wife had put the plugs in, I'm afraid she forgot to lube the
threads before installing but the others came out okay.) I didn't know that
they even made 'easy out's that big - had to be 3/8&quot; at least.

anyway, engine now runs smooth and I have my head temp gauge working again.
Driving below freeway speeds it stays in the 350-400F range, although at
freeway speeds and above it climbs up to 500F. It cools down quickly
though. And the oil temp is running nice and cool 210-220 tops. So I guess
the head leakage was most of the overheat problem, and I guess the heads
just run a little hot when you're pushing that much mass through the
atmosphere!

thanks all,
