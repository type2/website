Head gasket problems are definitely heard of in Sweden, at least. It's
pretty much taken for granted that they start leaking within 150.000 km of
use, whith a somewhat higher life expectancy on later models.

&lt; Vanagons in the United States have or will have to face.  I'm just
&lt; wondering if head gasket problems are as common in Germany and Europe as
