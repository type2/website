Subject:      me again: 4x4 diesel campers

well ... i had never thought of it, but why not? surely the fire departments
in germany have to have diesel buses, and surely they need 4x4, too.

now, as to getting one over here ... i think you'd have to create it yourself.
but the syncro 4x4 has basically the same transmission as the 2-wheel drive
vanagon (well, it matches up to the same engine, anyway. that helps). the
question is: is the 1981-1983 vanagon diesel engine adaptable to the later
vanagon transmission? if so, you could find a syncro camper and put in the
diesel engine. anything is possible ... with enough time and money. :)

boy, can you imagine the torque and grunt that thing would have! :) i'm
wondering just how useful a TURBO diesel syncro camper would be, though ...
wouldn't a turbo be kinda dangerous ... splashing through the water and all?
or maybe they don't expect you to really get muddy with it ... just zoooom
down the highway and park in a campground. but then again, i guess the turbo
would get pretty wet just on rainy highways. ??

the 4x4 buses of 1968-1979 body-style were, as i understand it, built for the
german army (nato as well?). whether any of those survived, i can't say.
and whether they actually went into production, i don't know. i've seen some
pictures of them (anybody know why germans like to put skinny knobby tires on
their 4x4 vehicles?).

with Ralph Nader and my government trying to protect me from myself, i doubt
that there are any sort of these over here. but then again, you'd think with
as many nuts in the world as there are, at least ONE would have made it over
here. :)
