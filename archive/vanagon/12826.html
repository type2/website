&gt; yup. funny thing is, the oil is cooled by running the anti-freeze/coolant
&gt; throught the cooler!!! i always thought the coolant was hotter than the
&gt; oil, but apparently not so.

as i understand it, the ideal oil temp is very close to coolant
temp-- 180 to 200 degrees.  i don't know if this is by design or
accident.  the autos i've run with oil coolers seem to hold their
oil temp around 190 in easy driving and go up to 230 or more under
hard driving.  the advantage of coolant/oil contact seems to make
sense.  during warm-up the hot coolant would actually serve to warm
the oil quicker(definately noticed a time lag during warm-up between
the coolant which reaches temp first and the oil) and in hard
driving, take heat away.
