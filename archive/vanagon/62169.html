Subject: Re: Clicking noise (was Vanagon Puzzler)


This is interesting to me.  Lately I have been noticing a singular click 
right after a cold start when I barely rev the engine.  Its just one 
click just after the rpms rise above idle, no noise when I let off on the 
pedal.  
It goes away very quckly, like within a block.  I only hear it after the 
van has sat for the night.  It does not affect perfomance at all.  I have 
looked around and can't find anything loose (exhaust, etc.).  
Could I be hearing this switch and just never noticed it before?
The best description I have for the sound:  it sounds like the click of a 
butterfly valve closing on the carb of an older car when you set the 
automatic choke with the gas pedal.  
Its probably normal or not serious, but mystifying to me nonetheless.  
Any imput out there on what I'm hearing?  I'm trying to weed-out any 
potential bugs as I am going on a road trip in a couple of weeks.
TIA!

&gt; &gt; Sounds like it could be the idle portion of the switch that you are talking
&gt; &gt; about.  If that sticks and stays closed when the throttle is opened,  the
&gt; &gt; engine will seem to hunt until it reaches a point where the deceleration
&gt; &gt; fuel shut-off is bypassed at around 2500 RPM. Try adjusting it. Bentley
&gt; &gt; covers it.
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds right,altho it ends up near 3000 rpm.  Adjust?  What's to
&gt; adjust?  It seems to work normally, makes a little click, but evidently
&gt; the circut stays open (or is it closed?)  Anyway, just yanked one of the
&gt; wires on back and it runs fine.  I don't have a Bently, hence all the
&gt; questions,ie,  WHAT IS IT?  And do I need it?  What for?
