Subject: Where Are They Now?

'Busers:

Pardon me if I wax nostalgic, but there is a name I have not
seen in a long time.  Someone who started SOTO, if I
remember correctly.  Someone who started the Transporter
Talk column in DB&amp;HVWs.  Someone who wrote of part hunting
in Mexico, Greece (and some other places).  Someone who
wrote two *History of the Type 2* articles for DB&amp;HWs,
promised the series would countinue, then disappeared.

Does anyone out there know where Jeff Walters is?

No particular point...just wondering.
