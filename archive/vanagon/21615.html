Subject: The Samba Server needs you

     Don't be shy,
     
     I'f you've got a v-dub and you want it on the internet,
     
     get a piccy scanned in (24-bit, Jpeg),
     
     email it to me with some text,
     
     and I'll put it up on the Samba Server.
     
     Oh, by the way I've updated the pages with a new look (good with 
     Netscape 1.1n).
     
     Lee.
