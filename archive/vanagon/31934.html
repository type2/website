&gt; There are some great pictures of this Deluxe at Thom's barndoor page:

These are duplicates of pictures on my page under GNATT.  I took them
during GNATT as we passed through Albuquerque 9 months ago.  I have one 
more picture that I have not scanned yet, of the front view of the bus.
I'll try to get it scanned before too long.  The scans are fairly
low-res, to save space, but if anyone is seriously interested I can
rescan them at a higher resolution to provide greater detail.
