Subject: overdrive 67 bus- possible?
Date: Mon, 18 Apr 94 12:13:16 EDT


just got my 67 camper on the road and it tweeks pretty bad at 55 miles per hour
.... i was wondering if i can stick an overdrive gear or later tranny into the 
bus so that i can go a little faster on the highway??? has anyone done this???
since i will drive the bus from ohio all the way to new Foundland and back down
to south carolina this summer i would really like to be able to go faster!
any help would be appreciated.
thanks in advance
