 I know they're used in aircraft applications. Havn't seen them at parts
 stores around here.(ohio) Speaking of plugs, does anyone have any input
 about the splitfires????
 
  &gt;&gt;

There are extensive threads on some of the high performance car usenet
newsgroups on splitfires.  There are very different opinions, some of them
quite strong.  As I recall someone did a dyno test and found some difference,
but definitely not as advertised (5h.p.).  The only comment that stands out
in my mind is that electricity, like water will always follow the path of
least resistance.  As a result, the drawings of two (or three) sparks
traveling to the electrode from each prong is unlikely in reality.

I recently replaced my plugs.  They had no Bosch platinums in stock so I put
in the three-prongs.  Much to my surprise, that's what was in the car when I
replaced them.

The only real test would be to try two new sets of plugs.  I can't afford
that.
