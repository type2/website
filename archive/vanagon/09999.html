Subject: Re: Mildew  and  Mold!!!! HELP!!!

&gt;After a very  wet winter, my  poptop lid and canvas have sprouted some gross
&gt;green  mildew  spots all over!! What is the advice of those who experienced
&gt;similar disasters?I need to clean it up quick,before my van looks like a
&gt;4  week  old Japanese  Orange!!! What's  a  safe way  to do it without
&gt;bleaching the orange-colored canvas and flocked interior side of the
&gt;fibreglass?
&gt;Moldingly yours,
&gt;Courtney

Well, not having a poptop &amp; canvas, this suggestion may not be worth
diddly, but I've cleaned mildew out of the Camper's carpeting with a
solution of trisodium phosphate &amp; HOT water.  TSP is not terribly nice
stuff--wear rubber gloves (which you'd have to do if the water's hot enuff
anyway...) and rinse the surface well with clean water.  You should be able
to find TSP at any hardware or paint store.  I'm not sure what effect, if
any, this will have on your fiberglass and/or canvas, but it should go
easier than using straight bleach.
