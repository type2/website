Subject: Re: Roof racks for 76 Type II?

&gt;Anyone have any reccomendation on what kind of roof racks will fit a
&gt;76 Type II non camper. I want to put a couple of windsurfers up there.

&gt;PS: If you are selling something, or a vehicle its worth mentioning
&gt;    where you are. It is often difucult to tell what continent a post
&gt;    comes from, let alone whether it is close enough to bother following up.


I believe you could fit a high foot Thule rack on your ride. Check it out.

P.S. Know anywhere (pref. in Canada) I can get high back front seats that
will fit into my bus?
