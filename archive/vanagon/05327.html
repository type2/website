&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; If you were in this, what would you do?
&gt; 
&gt; A '83 water-cooled with 113k miles starts showing signs of
&gt; bad headgaskets. It will cost $1,200 to replace the gaskets.
&gt; Besides either selling it or replacing the gaskets, what
&gt; other reasonable option does the owner have? 
&gt; 
&gt; VW claims that they will not be responsible for this problem
&gt; (even it is a well-known design flaw) for pre-1985 with 80k+ miles
&gt; Vanagons. Does the owner still have any recourse?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your comments.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; James
&gt; 
Yes, I would have been extremly diligent, like Joel, and would have
replaced the coolant from day one every year with the exact coolant
specified by Volkswagen, I would also have had  my head gaskets replaced
at the 60,000 mile mark whether they needed it or not and i would have
checked the radiator and coolant system for proper operation
 on a germanically and anally retentive basis of every month for the life
of the van.

In short, bite the bullet, and pay out the 1200 and be lucky your heads are 
-- not cracked. You are among the fortunate few who have not experienced
the worst case scenario.......DC
