&gt; 
&gt; As of friday, I'm outta here.  AOL is a major rip off.  What I want to know
&gt; is where else I can go.  Any suggestions??  I don't want anything spiffy, I
&gt; don't need online shopping malls or online pet stores or any of the other
&gt; shit that AOL has.
&gt; 
&gt; Any Suggestion Will Help!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning on picking up my last mail on Sat. the 9th, so drop a line.  
&gt; Thanks a bunch,
&gt; 
&gt; Brandy
&gt; Eugene, OR

So what is AOL?  Sounds like I should avoid it at all costs.
