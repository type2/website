Subject:      Mid 80s Vanagon mirrors

If you have the stock mirror as I do on an 85 Vanagon that will not hold
it's position, try this.  Put a screw type hose clamp around the base
socket and tighten firmly.  The marine type are all stainless and do not
rust.  This has worked well for me
on both mirrors.
