Subject: Wiring Troubles

&gt;From: ben_at_CASE.CO.UK(Ben Ryan)

&gt;  I started to fit the wiring in my '62 at the weekend, this
&gt; is the last thing i have to do before it will be on the
&gt; road,  and i ran into the problem of, on the dash there is
&gt; two knobs one either side of the steering wheel one
&gt; operates the headlights the other one the windscreen
&gt; wipers, which side does each one go as they were not fitted
&gt; when i bought the van.

&gt;Cheers,

&gt;Ben Ryan

Ben,

I was about to jump right in and say without a doubt that on
a '62 the wiper switch is left and the lighting switch is
right.  Then I saw your address of .UK and wondered if this
is true for RHD as well as LHD layouts.

It may not make any difference at all, but the length of
wires may determine where you put the switches.  I do not
have my wiring diagram with me at work, but I seem to recall
a short, large gauge, red wire between the ignition switch
and the lighting switch.  The length of that may determine
how far away from the ignition switch the lighting switch
can go.  With LHD, the ignition is on the right, same as the
lighting switch.

Does that help?
