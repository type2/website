Subject: shower anywhere


Does anyone here have experience with a company called Shower Anywhere?
I saw their ad in the back of Trailer Life magazine, and requested product
literature.  They make some pretty interesting stuff, although on the
expensive side.  Basically, they offer a variety of ways to allow
for taking a shower.  There are several models running from choices of
power sources (ranging from AC, cig. liter, D-cell battery, etc.),
and heatable by various different methods (electric immersion, over
a campfire, over a propane stove, over their propane burner, etc.).  There's
a model which has an included tank, and another which recirculates the
water back into a plastic tank, after first running it over a heat
exchanger, which can for example be placed atop their propane burner.
They also sell a self-standing 30&quot; square shower stall.  

Capacities range from 2.5-10.5 gallons, and weights from 8.5-20 lbs
(when empty, of course).  Size for the smalles unit in inches is
about 9x13x11 (HxLxW), and for the largest 23x18x8.  Depending
on how fancy you want to get (in choices and options and frills),
costs range from about $150-350 or so.
