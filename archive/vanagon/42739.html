TO&gt;I flip the bail down, but it doesn't really matter, since it you do get 
TO&gt;stuck just remove the bail by popping it out of the hole it sits in at he 
TO&gt;fore and aft ends of the head.  No prob.

I flip down as well, though sometime the cover gets a little caught
on its lower lip by the bail, no problem you can wiggle it free.

TO&gt;And, no, don't remove the wheels.  That's silly.

Definitely.

O&gt;    - short (3&quot; or so) 3/8&quot; drive socket extension (as leverage to help 
TO&gt;      get bail back on--a trick David Schwarze showed me)

I'm not sure of the Schwarze trick here but I'll interject that a 13mm
or so open end wrench does a dandy job as a lever for working
the bail back up the cover, first you lever it up a little way using the
open end rocking it on the rounded outside of the wrench, then
you insert the wrench as a lever entirely under the bail, its a bunch
stiffer than a short enough screwdriver to fit in the confined space.
