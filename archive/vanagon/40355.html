Subject: Re: Gas Prices


&gt;Here in Saskatchewan (another province in Canada - not as pretty as BC, but
&gt;&quot;so flat we can see the future coming&quot;) the provincial gov't spends less
&gt;than 20% of the money they collect on the gasoline tax on road maintenance.
&gt;The gov't is also allowing some paved roads to &quot;revert to gravel&quot;. The rest
&gt;of the gas tax money goes into the province's general revenue fund. You'd
&gt;immediately notice this when you enter the province, as the roads are
&gt;riddled with potholes, and have thousands of patches per km. As the old 
joke
&gt;goes: How are Saskatchewan highways and golf courses similar? They both 
have
&gt;18 holes per mile.



Wellllll.... not here in California!!!

Here, *all* of the federal and state tax money goes into the general
funds of each organization.

In fact, when I moved here, I was &quot;allowed&quot; to pay a $300 fine&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;fee for
an &quot;environmental protection fund&quot;, since the three cars I brought in,
were not Calif. cars with the additional smog equipment those have. The
fact that they all passed the higher CA emissions standards, was irrelevant.
Yes, that's $300 for *each* car, $900 total.

Well, sez I, at least I'm paying for people working to fight for
environmental cleanliness, right?

Wrongo-- these &quot;fees&quot; go into the general fund, just like traffic tickets
and court fines do. Any environmental benefits that come from my $900,
are strictly an accident. Whereas they *could* have simply required me
to spend that $900 cleaning up my cars' emissions equipment. Except they
were quite clean already...

End of tirade. Wasn't even long.
