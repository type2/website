I think that I am experiencing this same problem.  If anyone has any ideas
please post them to the list. Thanks.

&gt; cycle from approx 400 - 1000 rpm at idle.  The Hall unit checks out 
&gt; okay, fuel pressure and flow volumeseems good, but I think that the 
&gt; vacuum unit is not doing its job.  Vacuum seems low at the fuel 
&gt; pressure regulator unless above 2000 rpm.

&gt; Any tips or advice from anyone (besides my wife's &quot;Blow it up!&quot;), 
&gt; would be appreciated.
