Subject: EV oil change- post mortem



&gt;  VW dealers must use a special tool because the original filter wasn't put on
&gt;  at no 14 lb/ft ! (like it says on the filter).


I remember the times I used to have 'quality' time to change the oil myself.
For some reason, I'd torque the oil filter in at the right  torque, and
it would always seem much tigther to pull out at the next change.  
Never figured out why...
