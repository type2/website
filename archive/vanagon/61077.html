&gt;&gt;Ironically from the way back from the VW show, my OXS light came on.  
&gt;&gt;I went back to the discussion about open/closed loop, but didn't see 
&gt;&gt;anywhere what it means when the light comes on.  Anyone?  I presume 
&gt;&gt;it means either the O2 sensor has failed or there is another problem 
&gt;&gt;with the exhaust (e.g. hole).
&gt;
&gt;Hole is very close.  
&gt;There is a hole in a black box behind the driver side kick pannel.  This
box has the speedometer cable going through it.  Use a pencil, or other
pointed object, and push the button.
