So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Ok,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Its time to revisit the moaning wheel:
&gt; 
&gt; 	My front right wheel makes this moaning, groaning kinda noise.  I just
&gt; put new wheen bearings in last December.  I fixed a master cylinder problem
&gt; last week, but it still sounds like its rubbing or something.  The noise
&gt; is consistent with speed.  I've re-greased the wheel bearings a couple of
&gt; times.  It will make the noise even if I just put the drum on the spindle
&gt; with my hands, and wiggle it back and forth, without the nuts.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any new gueses?  This is the _only_ mechanical niggly I have right

Well it is my contention, Thom, that if something (anything) is rubbed, a
moan will eventually follow. ;)

Seriously, it sounds like there it's something to do with the break lining.
I'd pull the hubs off and have a look see.  You may have some foreign 
object lodged in there making this, ahem, sound.
