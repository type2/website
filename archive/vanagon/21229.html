Hi,

	Today, when I got to work, I stuck a meat thermometer in the oil
dipstick tube, and got a reading of 210F   I did this immediately after
I shut the motor off.

	Is this normal?  I've never had any quantitive values for VW oil
temps before.  I bought the thermo to check the guage vs real-life in
the porsche - dead on! - not bad for a 22+ year old guage!

	If not normal, what are reasonable temps?

Thom
