Subject: Re: TIRES for VW Bus

&gt;&gt;    I just bought 5 new Michelin snow tires for my '79 Bus at Wal-Mart. 
&gt;&gt; They're not too radical a tread design, so I figure they'll be good on 
&gt;&gt; back roads, on the beach, the interstates and so on.
&gt;&gt;    They're P 195/75R14 X-MS-PLUS  M+S.  The manual calls for 185 diameter 
&gt;&gt; tires but I figure 195s aren't that far off.
&gt;&gt;    They cost $62.50 each, including mounting, spin balance, 70,000 
&gt;&gt; mile tread warranty and lifetime flat or blowout warranty good at 
&gt;&gt; any Wal-Mart.  They were remainders.
&gt;
&gt;Are they load range C or 6ply tires?  That's what is recommended for all 
&gt;buses since, I think, about 1964.
&gt;
&gt;To answer the first guys question about tires, Price/CostCo has Yokohama 
&gt;Y811 tires that are load range C for a good price.  They are light truck 
&gt;tires and have a beefy look about them.  The 215-75-15 had a price of $67 
&gt;each (plus tax and $7 mount and balance).  I didn't get a price on any other 
&gt;sizes.  I _was_ planning on getting the 215, but I think I'll go for a 
&gt;195 or so now that I'm getting the new tranny.

One thing I haven't seen mentioned in these tire posts is the rotating
weight of the tire.  A larger tire likely weighs more and will therefore rob
a bit of power.  The 185 tire should get better mileage.  Bicyclists know
this stuff intimately.  Whether this is worth the trade in handling would be
a personal decision.
