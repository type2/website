Subject: Rigid Hitch moved

 SyncroBeast           Rigid Hitch moved
Into a nice new big facility just a bit south of their previous location in
Bloomington (Home of the infamous Mega Mall of America) to Burnsville.  Here
is their new address.  And yes, the hitch is nice enough as hitches go BUT is
not set up as a receiver type hitch.  

RIGID HITCH                                Hitches and Accessories
   Rigid Hitch, Inc.                       (612) 895-9616
   3301 W. Burnsville Parkway    trailer hitch for vanagons; mounts on rear
   Burnsville, MN                          tow hooks
                            1000 lb weight, 100 lb tongue weight

So Joel, you might want to update the record, as they have been there now for
at least a year.

'89 Syncro Beast
'87 GTI 16V
