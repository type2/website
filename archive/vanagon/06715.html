Subject: Re: batteries ... and rummors of batteries



In my case I have installed two marine deep cycle batteries, jumbo, under 
the rear seat. The front second compartment in my '85 was too small.

You need to think of your alternator's output, the guage of connecting 
cables, a regulator of some sort, and similar factors to get the most out 
of it.
