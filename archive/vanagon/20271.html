So dean c aukes says:
&gt; at night.  It did work really well.  The negatives are 1) you have to haul 
&gt; all the stuff, 2) you need to find a lower fan/thermostat setting that will 
&gt; keep the van cool but not freeze you out.  Keep in mind that the thermostat 
&gt; really doesn't know what the temp in the van is - you could put a probe 
&gt; inside, but I didn't go to the trouble.  The positives are 1) it didn't cost 
&gt; very much, 2) it was kind of fun to do, 3) it makes summer trips in the bus 
&gt; bearable 'cause sleeping with all the screens open, top popped, and even the 
&gt; screen installed in back (with fans) is not cool enough!

Of course, this assumes your version of camping includes electrical hook-ups..

That ain't camping.....IMHO.
