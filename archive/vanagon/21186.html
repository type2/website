Subject: Now that I have the gauges installed...

... I get to worry about the readings.

Already, I'm surprised at the head temperature. I took a 15 mile drive, with
moderate inclines, and was surprised to see it hit 500F on those inclines!

80 Vanagon camper, 2L engine
Ambient temperature today: 85F
Engine speed: 4K rpm
head temp: 425-500F
oil pressure: 45-60 psi (dropping as engine got hotter)
cruising mostly 45-50 in 3rd gear, occasionally dropping to 3K rpm in 4th gear

Don't know what the oil temp is yet - I'm awaiting my drain plug sender - it
should arrive tomorrow.

What is the ideal engine speed these things should be run at anyway?

regarding the head temp gauge - once I realized that #3 cylinder was on the
left side of the vehicle I found that I could run the supplied wire through
the passenger compartment and up under the dash. Just barely - I had to
move that gauge over to the extreme left just so it would reach! Next step
is to
determine what the delta is between the two wiring sets. If it's not much,
or if its predictable, I may switch back to under-vehicle wires. You see,
the carpet
in my camper was fastened down by someone with an eye for permanence.
There's no obvious way to lift it up - the edge by the door is a solid
piece of metal with fasteners visible - how did they do that? So I have
this wire snaking along the edge of the cabinetry up to the cockpit deck,
where I can put it under the carpet/rubber there. Maybe I should install
some wood trim to hide it?

well, enough for now. I'm just glad its all installed!
