Subject: Eric O creates TRIPLE winners

Dealing with Eric O to get a syncro nameplate off the rig he is parting
out turned out to be a great success.

The winners are...

1) The Vanagon List charity drive

2) My Syncro Westy and the family that loves it

3) Eric O and his generous heart

I wholeheartedly recommend working with Eric O, he came thru for me, and
I suspect he isn't going to change anytime soon.

why don't you go to: http://gozips.uakron_dot_edu/~koesel/SMT/ and check his
scene out?

Thanks Eric
