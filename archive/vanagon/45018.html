&gt; Why then do so many aircraft engines have horizontaly opposed engines? They
&gt; run at that rpm for long periods.  Also why has porsche used horizontaly
&gt; opposed engines for so long if there was an rpm limit so low?  I read in
&gt; Marks Engineering Hand Book that horizontaly opposed engines have the same
&gt; benifits as a v type engine.  A horizontaly opposed engine is a V with
&gt; 180deg between banks.

Most aircraft with HO4C engines run at 2,000 rpm.
