Subject: 1979 heater boxes

Well VW friends, it looks like VW has done it again.  It appears that the 
heater boxes for the 1979 Transporter are one year only.  They are no 
longer available new (Why would somebody make replacements for a part 
that was only produced for eleven months??).  They resemble the '72-74 
boxes and can be modified to fit the '79.

However...

Does anybody know if the muffler connections on the earlier heater boxes
will match up with a 1979 exhaust system?  If they don't I may have to 
replace both heater boxes and switch to the older muffler.   This would put
me way over budget ('72-74' heater boxes run about $225.00 a piece, not
including the time and effort involved in modifications).  

Anyhow..

Does anybody have a used driver side heater box for a 1979 BUS (or aleast 
know where to find one).  

Thanks....
