     Pine.ULT.3.91.960109165706.13084B-100000_at_hamlet.umd_dot_edu (where in the 
     world did he manage to get a handle like that) was asking about 
     propane engine heaters.  I saw a lot of these when I was working at a 
     mine in Western Wyoming - but never on a VW.  At our mine site, about 
     15 miles so. of Big Piney, WY it frequently got into the -40's in 
     January and February and I have personally experienced -59F.  (Words 
     cannot describe how cold that was!) The heaters were, of course, used 
     to warm up vehicle engines so they had a reasonable chance of 
     starting.  They were usually located on a fender well - close to the 
     battery if possible - and were set up to heat and circulate coolant in 
     and out of the engine block by convection so you didn't exhaust your 
     battery running a pump.  
     
     The folks that used these heaters were typically workers who had to 
     park their vehicles - usually PU trucks - outside away from any source 
     of electricity that could be used for an electric heater.  (Electric 
     heaters were much more common.)  An hour or so from the end of the 
     shift, typically, one guy would be assigned to go light everybody's 
     heaters.  That way everybody's truck would (maybe) start at the end of 
     the shift.  When it was really cold out, the guys on a crew typically 
     parked together and travelled to and from work together so that if 
     anyone had trouble, he could catch a ride with somebody else.  At -40 
     and colder, you could easily freeze to death in a couple of hours.  
     
     Frankly, in those below zero temperatures, the heaters could warm your 
     vehicle up enough so that the oil would flow and the engine would turn 
     over fast enough to have a chance of starting.  When it got really 
     cold, most folks would assist the heater by throwing blankets or old 
     sleeping bags over the hood while the heater was running.  A nice 
     &quot;bonus effect&quot; of using the heaters was that you would start to get 
     comfortable in the cab about 15 minutes sooner than you would 
     otherwise.
     
     I'm not sure I'd recommend one of these heaters for comfort heating 
     for a WCVW van.  Here's why not:
     
     1)  The way they are set up, most of the heat will be lost to the 
     environment - not moved into the van.  Not very efficient compared to 
     an RV-type propane space heater.  And - might not be able to hold a 
     comfortable sleeping temperature if it good very cold outside.
     
     2)  I'm not sure that the exhaust venting would be appropriate or safe 
     for use as a van comfort heater - might have CO buildup or O2 
     deprivation problems.
     
     3)  I'm not sure, given the limited space in and around a VW van, if 
     you could even do a proper installation of one of these heaters -    
             
     4)  There are a lot of UL and CSA approved heaters readily available 
     at RV dealers that can be easily installed in a VW van - I've seen a 
     number of installations and have read a number of testimonials on this 
     list.  They're not cheap - although you might be able to find a good 
     used one - but whoever said this was a cheap hobby?
