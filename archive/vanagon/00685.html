Subject: Refrigerator Madness

It usually does not work when I blow air *in* to the fridge drain tube or I
would do it that way. 

John Pinkham has the excellent suggestion to somehow rig up a bike pump to
pump the air out. I wonder how this could be done...

The reason the fridge burner goes off while driving, by the way, is usually a
faulty gasket seal in the combustion chamber. When this seal gets bad it lets
air leak out and that allows drafts in that chamber which causes the flame to
blow out. 

This fridge is made in Luxumbourg, of all places. Unlike the other fridges in
the dometic line up.

I assume you have cleaned the combustion chamber as per the instructions for
the fridge, now haven't you? 

Every westy owner on this list who hasn't taken their fridge out to clean the
combustion chamber is neglecting their camper. You know who you are if you
are reading this and you haven't done this yet! And if you have done it, then
it means you are a nerd and you are neglecting your family, your friends,
your job, your life...

Hummm...
