Subject: Re: [f] Kavorkian drove a VW

Someone needs to start a famous VW Bus museum.  Add the Branch Davidian 
(sp?) Bus seen in all the video footage of the Waco raid.  Kavorkian's 
Bus has been used for assisted suicides in the past.  It would give me 
the creeps to own it. :(

&gt; Did anyone catch that Dr. Death used to drive a VW bus? He had a
&gt; pre-1972 bay window, white, with curtains and louvered side middle
&gt; windows.
&gt; 
&gt; I say &quot;used to&quot; because it was impounded when they found his last
&gt; customer inside it. There was a picture of it being towed away about 2
&gt; weeks ago, in some Bay Area newspaper.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the way to go...inside a VW! I hope he gets it back soon.
