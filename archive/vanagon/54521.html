Subject: Re: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling

PO obviously had it done, but on one occasion it stalled on my wife.  She 
pulled over, restarted it and all was fine.  I have had slight hestation 
cruising down the highway at 65-70 mph in a 22 F head wind, but it didn't 
completely stall out on me like it did her.  (I'm wondering if the deceleration 
fuel shut-off may be the problem.  Anybody had an experience with this acting 
up?)

The auxillary wiring harness is very easy to install (about 2 minutes).  It's 
located right at the 12 o'clock position to the air filter housing.  Disconnect 
the wire harness that is there and add on the new auxillary wiring harness to 
the connector and the existing harness.  Seems like I've heard that they cost 
at least $100.

Subject: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling

In the last year my 90 Vanagon has on 4 or 5 occasions showed symptoms of
the intermittent stalling while driving.  This problem is very well
described in the vanagon archives and the symptoms (and fix) were clearly
described by derekdrew.  The fix was to buy a auxillary wiring harness for
the air flow box (part # 025906302).  Up to this point I have not taken my
van to a mechanic to have this checked out because it is very intermittent
and has not really been a problem for me.  Anyways my question is this,
have other owners replaced this harness, and has the intermittent stalling
disappered after doing this fix?  Also how difficult is this for a
shadetree mechanic to do?  Has anyone replaced the harness and had the
problem persist?

Thanks,
