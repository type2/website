good point. this is what i mean by:
lug nuts: when you unscrew the unscrewable part that keeps the wheel on the
          car, what you have is a little nut. a hexagonal piece of metal with
          a hole in it, and that hole has threads in it.
stud:     the threaded part that the lug nuts screws onto. the stud stays on
          the car, and you can hang the wheel on it.
lug bolts: when you unscrew the unscrewable part that keeps the wheel on the
          car, what you have is a little bolt. a hexagonal headed, threaded
          bolt. what is left on the car is a threaded hole. you can't hang
          the wheel on this (hole).

now as to why i call them that, i have no idea. that's what i've always heard
them called and it's probably wrong.

but! on my vanagon, i have the following:
front wheels - lug bolts.
rear wheels  - studs and lug nuts.

i thought that was the way ALL the vanagons were, from 1980 onward.
now, as i recall, my 71 and 73 had studs and lug nuts all round, on all four
wheels.
