So Tim Smith sez:

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't _have_ a trans strap 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I bet you do, unless it's corroded away, your tranny has a big flat ground 
&gt;strap onto a cross member, so the starter is grounded, so the solenoid is 
&gt;grounded etc. tim s.

No, I don't.  I put in a solid trans mount when I converted from a split
case trans to a tunnel case, and didn't really have a place to put the strap,
so I left it off.  No problems with grounding whatsoever.  

The problem turned out to be a seriously corroded positive wire off
the starter going to the front.
