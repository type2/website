A lot! Shortly after I installed a 2m (144MHz) ham radio in my 91 Vanagon,
I began to notice a lot more sputtering and rough running. I attributed it
to yet another problem like the infamous one solved by the air box wiring
harness, or needing a new throttle switch, etc., etc...  One day I'm driving
down the highway and chatting with a friend and the engine practically dies.
I told him I had to pull off the road right away and signed off the radio.
A few seconds later the engine comes back to life. I dropped it off at the
VW dealer to have them check it and do the fuel injector recall fix and they
didn't find anything. It happened a couple more times before I realized the
correlation between engine dies and transmitting. I cut back from high power
(35 watts) to low power (10 watts) and no problem now. I got a lot of infor-
mation on RF testing and limits from VW via the national ham radio organiza-
tion (ARRL), but it's all in German so I don't have a clue what it says.
(Anybody want a copy to translate, drop me an email note!) So, I just live
with lower power...

Oh yeah, I can transmit 100 watts on the HF bands (2 thru 30MHz, note that
CB is 27MHz) with a permanent mount antenna system and have no problems with
the ECU...
