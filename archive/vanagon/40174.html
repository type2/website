&gt;&gt; I think that's good old market forces making it that high-- every country
&gt;&gt; in Europe has similar prices, and has had forever.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But I do wonder why they can't buy it as cheaply from the Middle East
&gt;&gt; as the U.S. obviously does.
&gt;
&gt;They can.  I am pretty sure the Europeans get their gas for about the
&gt;same price we do.  When I lived there, Americans in the military were
&gt;entitled to tax-free gasoline, which usually worked out to 25 cents a
&gt;liter.  That would indicate that the rest is all tax.

Wow-- that's pretty telling.

Here in California, we pay around 40 cents/gal  taxes, added at the pump.
So six months ago it would have been around $.80/gal for regular, $1.05/gal
for premium unleaded. Today it would be around $1.10/gal regular, $1.30/Gal
premium... plus tax.

How many liters in a gallon?

 &quot;Tax the rich, subsidize the poor.&quot;
 &quot;From each according to his means, to each according to his needs.&quot;
 Any Questions?
