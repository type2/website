&gt;&gt;&gt;	2.  If you are a mechanic, it would be a great travel van for a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;		great price ($900), as all else is in great shape
&gt;&gt;                           ^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;                           worth it for a parts vehicle alone!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;It has air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, is dark blue, nice
&gt;&gt;&gt;paint, new radials, water-cooled so it goes much faster than old buses,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and has about 90,000 miles on the car, and about 20,000 on the rebuilt
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;WAAHHHH, it's obvious that Santa lives in California in the off season. Why 
&gt;&gt;don't I EVER see deals like this within walking distance. This is impeding 
&gt;&gt;the growth of my fleet severely!  tim s.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

It appears to be a very attractive deal but... I thought about it for a
minute then I think people should really think about the &quot;but&quot; possibility
more before getting too excited.

Remember it's a watercooled vanagon, not an aircooled brick. This means
if the engine needs work it could easily take $3k or more out of your
pocket. What if there are problems on FI, brakes, tranny... It will not be
cheap if you have any of these problems.

Sorry for being negative. I got my 83 westy (oh, it's watercooled, just
like my 84 vanagon) very cheap. But then I might need new heads. I am hoping
new head gaskets will fix it.
