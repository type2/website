Subject: Balance da engine parts


I got a question: how close do you balance the conn rods and pistons?  I
have about 15 grams difference in the conn rods which is too much, but I
read that only 8grams can be removed safely.  I had 3 pistons within 1.5
grams, and one which was 10 grams heavier.  I got them all to within 5
grams, but I was wondering if metal could be removed from the wrist pins.
It takes a whole lot of filing to get 5 grams off a piston.  steel is much
heavier.
 
any advice?
