Subject: Re: leak

well thanks Dennis  ,  It turned out to be the slave cylinder for the clutch
. Keith at Hendricks Foreign had it repaired by 9 am   I could'nt believe it
was done so fast  
I picked it up this after noon   the bill was :
100.00$ 2 hrs labor , 102 .48 for the part    , THe cylinder or rod was
rusted and 
broke in half    Keith said this is normal , but I should have heeded the
warning signs
ie. the leak ,  Hendricks only uses OEM or better parts so i'm cool now 
thanks to everyone for your imput     
tell my next breakdown   probably  tommorrow    bye   Mickey
