&gt; I am sure this gets discussed a lot, but I am going to ask anyway.  I am

&gt; the highway (relatively flat) without any water in the water tank and only

No, No, No. You're supposed to post a message saying, &quot;my gas mileage is 
such and such&quot;.  And then we all post obnoxious replies about how those 
numbers don't mean anything and Joe Schmoe down the street gets 35 mpg in 
his westy fully loaded going uphill against the wind -- you know -- to 
make you feel good &lt;grin&gt;.  Or if the number is a little high, we all 
(all 240 of us) send you personal messages filling up your mailbox asking 
how you get such high mileage. &lt;big smiles&gt;

It has been disucssed a lot, and the mileages are lower on the campers 
and higher on the others.  The 83-85 watercooleds report (note 
carefully chosen verb) the best mileage.  Mileages varied from 13 to 27, 
with most realistic being 16-17 in the city and 20-21 on the freeway.

Winter mileage is worse.
