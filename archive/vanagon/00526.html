Subject: Digest mode request response.

To set the vanagon list to digest, send a message to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with the line
set vanagon mail digest

It's usual for people to make the following errors:
   sending to the list address (vanagon_at_lenti)
   forgetting the word mail (the options for the mail parameter are ACK, 
   NOACK and DIGEST)

Hope that helps.
If you have more questions about this, please address them to me and not
to the list.

Thanks!
