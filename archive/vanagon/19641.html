Subject: CV joint bolts...clunk clunk

The bolts are relatively inexpensive, right?  (I mean like a few
dollars each).  I'd replace any with worn threads, then use some
blue (or is it red?  I can never remember which is the removable
kind) _Loctite_ thread locking compound according to the package
directions.  I've never had anything vibrate loose after using
that stuff.  It only takes a few drops, and as long as you use
the right color you can break it loose easily enough with a
wrench later.  I've never tried the &quot;permanent&quot; stuff, but I
guess once you put something together with that, you never take
it apart again, at least not by unscrewing it.

I started using it on a Triumph Spitfire's driveshaft-to-
differential mating because of a similar problem; now I use it
on nearly anything that might cause serious problems if it
vibrated loose.

Good Luck!
Dennis
