&gt; 1995 will be the year of the 68.  It's getting some
&gt; body work, new curtains, and a general makeover.  What
&gt; I'm looking for is a roof-rack (it's not a pop-top) for
&gt; it, to handle the canoes, the kid, etc.  Anybody got one
&gt; they want to sell?
&gt; 
&gt; 
I picked up a 2/3 roof rack for $50 at a VW show. It is one of the
all-metal types, and is really light, but also sturdy. Ihighly recommend
one, they are great things to put a lot of extra stuff. 
JUST BE REALLY CAREFUL as you will add at least a foot to your already
tall bus, and might very well scrape low awnings, parking decks, etc.
Mine is now at 7'4&quot; tall, and Ihave to avoid parking decks, and be
careful in general.

As to the painting, My buses always cry out to be painted; there's so
much space, and people expect buses to be crazy-looking anyway.
definately go crazy with it. And hey, if you don't like it, do it again!

Richard &quot;you can never have too colorful a bus&quot;
