Subject: Re: vanagon st. wheel angle


Oh, come on, the steering wheel is the best part about driving a Vanagon.
That way you know you are driving a real van, and not a minivan &lt;gasp&gt;.  I
hate having to drive my friends cars with their tiny little steering wheels.
I feel like I am driving a toy car.  Why don't they just put a little knob
on the end of the steering shaft so you can twist it with your fingers??!?
If you grap the top (more like front!) end of the wheel with you hand, then
it really feels like you are going in the direction to which you are pointing
with your hand.

Or are you comparing it to an older microbus.  Then I have to agree with
you.  I much prefer the old style steering wheel.  One can really lean on
it while driving on long trips and look down on the little people in the
minivans that pass you on the hills.  When you kind of hunch over and lean
on the wheel it also feels like you are helping your car along a little.

Is this standard driving position for others too?  Top view:

Yes, my advisor is out of town so I have plenty of time for ascii drawings.
