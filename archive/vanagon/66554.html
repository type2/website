Subject:      Re: Advice on heads needed.

I will flatly say this at this time and will detail in a later post,
I would go with Stephens and would by no means buy a rebuilt air
cooled head from AVP again.  The chance at not getting a core refund
is worth it for quality, and outright the price is about equal, you
just take a chance on an expensive core with Stephens, but there is
probably good reason for that.  However although I've emailed AVP a
couple of recent times with no response, I have not yet called to
bitch so I reserve judgement fully till I do so.
