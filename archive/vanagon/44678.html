&gt; I'm headed for Vallejo on this coming Sunday for the VW Good Guys Gig.  I'll
&gt; be bringing the whacked bus full of spare parts for sale at a swap spot near
&gt; you.  The sale includes the whacked bus ('71 westy), a couple carb &amp; FI

We'll be going down the night before and camping out, drinking beer,
etc.  Look for our wagons circled.
