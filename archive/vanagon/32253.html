&gt;Another engine worth considering is the GM 2.8l
&gt;V-6 used in many camaros,(mid-late 80's).  This engine with the tuned port
&gt;injection makes about 160HP and is very torquey.  It does about 25mpg hwy 
or
&gt;better in camaro.  Very cheap to keep,(&lt;$1800.00 brand new).


I couldn't agree more. Rebuilt longblocks are $650 from some shops.
This is the engine in the V6anagon. It's a blast to drive.
