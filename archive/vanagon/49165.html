Subject: 95 Eurovan camper price?

I have an option on a 95 Eurovan Winnebago conversion camper van with every
option known to man.  It has 900 miles on it. A celebrity bought it and
decided he didn't want it.  Bought a 4-dr. pick-up truck instead.  go
figure!

Anyway, since there is no blue book on this vehicle, I'm wondering if
anyone has a sense of what I should pay for it.

It has 5-speed standard transmission, air, butane heater, all the standard
camper fixin's, a 5 CD changer (dealer add on, I'm sure).

Thanks for your replies.
