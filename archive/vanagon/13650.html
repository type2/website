Subject:  UPDATE Re: HELP advise on purchase of '70 camper

Thanks to everyone who responded to my plea for advice on the '70  
camper.  You were all right, it was a pile of rust and work.  It's to  
bad it's been parked in a muddy field for a couple years and I  
suspect that is when it went downhill fast.  The guy was a slob.  It  
truly did have only 45K miles on it :-(

Thank you again.

I'll keep watching.

Bart
