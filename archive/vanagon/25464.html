Subject: Re: Campout with Bill/Honeymoon!

Yeah, let's all go camping with Bill and his sweetie on their Honeymoon. I'm
sure that it would be *really* appreciated. We would never get any rest
between the noise from the rocking bus (squeaking in the front passanger
corner/bad shocks), tending to the burning magnesuim ritual, Rat boys' usual
fun, Marthas' showers, and the residual effects of the fish tacos. How does
Baja sound? ;)
