Actually, I stopped by Carter Volkswagen used lot last weekend.  They had
a green '93 Westy weekender with 43k miles for &lt; $24k. If I understand
correctly Westy were only imported in '93 and not that many then.  This
would be a vehicle I love to own, seat 7 and 2 queen size beds for the
weekend, just one problem, I can't afford it.  They also had a white '93
full kit westy with a sold sign.  They had a couple other used EV.  No
Vanagons, Busses or Micro-Busses on hand.

	Good luck.
