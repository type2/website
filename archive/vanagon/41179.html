Subject: shift rod bushings

New shiftrod bushings needed.

I am replacing the transmission in my '68 Bus.  It was getting to be a 
real chore to make gear changes and it was jumping out of fourth whenever it
was under power.

When I got the old transmission out, I checked the shiftrod where it 
comes out of the tube and the rod flops around the perimeter of the 
tube and doesn't stay centered at all.  

Since I don't have any experience with shiftrods and tubes, I don't know 
if there is any sideplay allowed and if so, how much.  How much sideplay 
is there supposed to be with new bushings installed?  If there is none 
or very little sideplay supposed to be there, then I think that I probably
need new shiftrod bushings. 

This is where my problem arises.  I can't find a new front bushing for the
rear shiftrod.  Does anybody know where can I get the nylon shiftrod
bushings for my '68 Bus.  I've tried the local VW dealer and he tells me
&quot;they are a discontinued item. 

I've also tried &quot;the Bus Stop&quot; and &quot;Bus Boys&quot; with negative results at 
both places.

The bushing I need is:
Front bushing for the rear shiftrod.  The VW part number is 211 711 179

Please help,

Jerry
