Subject:      Re: Dashboard Organizer

'Lo  FWIW, I glommed onto a small (7&quot; x 11&quot;) plastic silverware
organizer, painted it brown (to match the brown trim and dash cover),
and set it on top of the dash, right in front of the driver's seat,
using two small patches of velcro to stabilize it. Works great for us.
Holds all that little stuff like a measuring tape, kleenix, VW pin-on
badge (dripper version), pocket knife, extra reading glasses,
toothpicks, pencil, and temporary repository for reciepts.

For beverages, we slid two of those plastic holders in on the panel in
front of the floor shift. Lastly, I bolted a one gallon coffee can (also
painted brown) to the floor on the right side of the floor shift to hold
Mama's mega sized water sipper (I tell folks it is her cuspidor, :D ).
We also hang the cell phone on the outside of the can.
