&gt;&gt; not bad i don't think, good tire....reinforced sidewalls...any comments?

Sounds like a freakin ripoff to me.  $384 for 4 tires?!?!?!?  I don't have
that kind of money to throw around.  I got two 205-70HR14 (note the HR
speed rating)
tires mounted and balanced for $96 out the door.  The sidewalls are stiffer
than load range C tires (I flexed them side by side) and as stiff as a load
range D.  They handle great, wear well (18,000 miles so far and still at
least half tread) and I am 101% satisfied with them.  I obviously didn't
want the HR rating because I am going to go that fast, but the HR brings
with it a reinforced sidewall that is just what the doctor ordered for my
two-ton bus.  I know someone is going to ask, so the tires are a wierd
off-brand called something like &quot;Tujungal&quot;, made in Indonesia, and I got
them at a hole-in-the-wall tire shop in San Diego next to Beeline alignment
on Garnet and I-5.  I don't care about their pedigree, they are GREAT
tires!  Wish I had bought 4 but I am 1400 miles away now.  Oh well.  :(


&gt;	185/70R-14 are NOT the correct size for a Type II vehicle they
&gt;are almost an 1&quot; &amp; 1/2&quot; too small!!!

Heed this man's warning.

&gt;	Price doesn't matter.. get the right size...  185R-14 or
&gt;195/75R-14 or 205/70R-14....

You can get the right size AND the right price if you look around.

&gt;	all of the above should be Reinforced or C load range or
&gt;higher...

... or HR rated.  Flex one for yourself sometime, you'll be amazed.
