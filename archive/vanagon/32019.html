Subject: 22 Dec Austin Chronicle

All,

The Chronicle did not come out this week, here are the VWs from the last
issue of '95: (All phone numbers 512 area code unless otherwise noted)

1970 Tan Volkswagon (Their error not mine)
Square Back(again theirs).Runs good. Minor
body damage. Needs T.L.C. (Don't they all?)
$550. Call Mike. 259-5825

1974 Ghia VW. Nice body,
new clutch, runs great $2500
OBO, call Scott 343-9545

1974 VW Bug Mint condition
Cherry red, 210-598-1430 (This would be the San Antonio area)

1977 Burgandy Bug. Runs
excellent, new tires, stereo,
moving, must sell. $500
477-3457

1982 VW Poptop Camper
van.  Engine rebuilt, 118k
miles, auto, AM/FM Cassette,
$2500 OBO. 303-2235

There is also a Jetta(91) and a Golf(85) that I can send you info about
if you want it.

I have not seen these vehicles, I might be able to look at these for
someone, on Saturdays only though.  I'm not going to make any comments
on my judgement, except to say that I am no expert when I comes to VW's
as I have only owned my Thing since last April, and my Westy since
October, and these are the only VWs I have owned.

Cheers,

David
74 Thing
79 Westy
