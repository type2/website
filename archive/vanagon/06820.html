Subject: Late TGIF entry and comment


Norman &quot;the inquisitor&quot; (especially after that Goldman =Golen 
comment ((sorry Harvey)) wrote:

&gt;My own personal choice for TGIF = This Group (Gruppe?) Is FRESH!


I would like to modify that and modify a Groucho Marx line...


TGIF = This Group is F*cked!!  :-)

And to paraphrase Groucho Marx...

I'd never join any group (club) that would have me for a member!
