Subject: VW Dealer mechanic-goons

I'm afraid that I have to agree with the opinions of many on the list about
the
quality of work from the VW dealers.  I had my Vanagon in for the PW recall
and had them charge the A/C while it was in.

When I picked up the van, the inside was sprinkled with black foam-filter
residue. aparently there is some filter used in the A/C. Mine had gotten old
and crumbly so when the A/C was turned on - foam shot out of the vents.
(Anyone know what this might be from? Should I replace it?)

I pointed it out to the service manager, who agreed that it was a mess - but
did not seem concerned about it - or willing to do anything about it. Later I
noticed greasy finger prints on the rear overhead cabinent, and the mechanics
had managed to unravel the winding on the sportgrip on the steeringwheel.

I realized that I was luckly they only had it for a day - had it been there
any longer it might have been reduced to a pile of nuts and bolts &lt;g&gt;

Does anyone have a good VW dealer story? They can't all be bad.... can they?
