Subject: FS:  79 Westy

I don't know what got into me, but I went crazy today and bought a 90 Westy
(Joel, change the stats) so now I have to put my 79 on the auction block.  

I bought it from fellow list member Mark Kunkel in December, so I haven't
had it too long, but I can tell you that its in good shape with a strong
engine, very little rust (except under the front windshield) new starter,
new rear brake cylinders, new push rod tube seals (so it doesn't leak
anymore) plus a few other new tidbits.  It has all the camping stuff, even
the kid cot, but the cabinets need some TLC.  $2800.  

If you're interested, email me or call me at 540-343-3829 or the # below.
