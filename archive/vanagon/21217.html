I was looking at timing lights last night and didn't know which one I 
wanted.  There are inductive type and advance type.  The former is 
about $20 cheaper.  Will it work for my bus?  I was at Sears.  Does 
anybody want to recommend a particular Sears model?  That said, I 
probably will not be able to afford one right now unless something big
happens.  More of a chance in a couple of more weeks.  So, any 
suggestions on where to static time my stock 1600dp with 009, Weber
progressive, single QP.  I am at about 1,200 feet.  Finally, where do
I find copper based anti-seize for my exhaust stud nuts.  I have drawn
blank looks from three different FLAPS.  This is getting close.  It 
might run this weekend, or next.  Thanks, Jim
