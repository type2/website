So martha the fish-trip gourmet rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Each vehicle brings 1/4-1/3 lb. seafood or fish per person in their
&gt;      vehicle for additing to the community pot chowder, AND signs
&gt;      up for one of the following to contribute to the potluck.  You 
&gt;      could make this beforehand, or on the premises, depending on
&gt;      the item, and/or your mood, style, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; 

Can you imagine all of us bringin' in all this fish past the park
entrance?  Whew!  Hopefully most of us will buy this fish closer
to the park.  I can't imagine buying fish in Sacramento (and you
can forget about it being fresh there) and hauling it all the way
to Pfeiffer Big Sur?  ;p
