Hello all,

I am new to the list, and have a question regarding a cold start
problem I just started having.
I am the proud owner of an 82 westie which I purchased about a
month ago. It had been running fine since I bought it, but last
week I started using the alarm system, and apparently it was
constantly going off and drained the battery. (I think it needs
some adjusting) . Anyway, I tried to push start it but could not
get it started. So I inlisted the help of a friend with jumper
cables to help me. It cranked over fine, but would not start ultil
I matted the gas pedal.  When it finally started, it ran pretty
rough, and I saw some grey smoke from the exaust, After a few
seconds it ran fine, as if nothing ever happened. The following
day I tried starting it , and again the same thing happened I had
to mat it to get it started, but when it is warm it will start
with no problem. So I changed the  spark plugs, and it was fine
for about three days, but now it seems to be doing the same thing
again. I live in the bay area, so I don't think it is temp
related.
Any Ideas?
Thanks 
Stephen Termecz

P.S.
I am new to the area, does anyone know a good mechanic near San
Rafael?
