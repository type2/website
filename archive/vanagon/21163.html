Subject: Re:PVC pipe awning trick

I've been haunted by my post related to the PVC awning. I guess my
explainations were as clear as mud at midnight. Please just get a length of
pipe and ... Well please just re-read the original post and get a piece of
pipe, cut it length wise so its kinda like a letter &quot;C&quot; created by only one
tablesaw blade width. Experiment with it.

Ted Morrison suggested using those little home window security clamps as the
&quot;holder&quot; of the tarp to the rain gutter.

Ted, if you still have the ascii please post it for our fellow listers...

What I've done is to put 3-4 spring clamps
&gt;along the length of the gutter to hold up the tarp,
&gt;then REI telescoping tent poles in the grometed corners
&gt;to hold the up (also using string/rope and tent stakes
&gt;and ties).  This seems to work well.  Alternatively, when
&gt;two busses are camping together at one of our outings,
&gt;we sometimes just make a bridge with the tarp from
&gt;one bus to another, using spring clamps on both.  Also
&gt;does a good job.  

Rusty thinks the point for this time is that creativity and ingenuity are
key rather than worrying about having &quot;just the right thing&quot;. Camping is for
relaxing. Take a load off and have fun! (Now if I could only find JUST the
right whatnot cabinet!)-kidding, trust me.
