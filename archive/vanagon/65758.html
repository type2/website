In Germany there are at least two tuners offering 4 inline TDI
(like US TDI Passat) conversions for Vanagons, Syncros too.
As an example, Winkler offers the conversion kit for DM 7000,00
including TDI engine 90 hp or 110 hp. To convert a waterboxer
Syncro you will need a lot of Vanagon Diesel parts and a modified
left engine support.

BTW: A TDI Vanagon speeds up to 140 KPH at a very fast
acceleration by using a Turbo Diesel gearbox.
