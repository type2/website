&gt; 	I used to have a notchback, with a huge, power-sucking
&gt; stereo system.  I used two Sears car batteries, I can't remember
&gt; the exact rating, and an isolator I got at a normal auto parts
&gt; store for about $30.  The generator charged up both batteries,
&gt; but only the stereo was hooked up to battery #2.  I could run the
&gt; stereo for hours until the thing croaked, and then start the car like 
&gt; nothing happend!  With this setup, it wouldn't matter if you used 
&gt; a deep cycle battery or normal battery, other that maybe for a 
&gt; deep cycle battery you might not want to me charging it up all 
&gt; the time...?

The isolater is great for separating the two and preserving the starter 
batter's starting abililty. But the purpose of the deep cycle is to get 
more hours of usage that the starter type battery. Once you decide you 
want to run applicances off of it, the deep cycle makes sense.
