Subject: Thanks

Many thanks to all that have responded to my post(or will respond).  I
haven't solved the emisisons problem yet, but the swift and very
considerate help of everyone has been terrific.  I never expected to have
so many respond, but so far 5 people have either given me suggestions or
offered to let me &quot;borrow&quot; the part from their own bus.

Thanks again to all,
Craig
