       ... it seems that they use four bolts to hold things together...

&gt;      Can anyone with a Diesel who has had the engine out confirm this?

My engine is not out, but in my Bentley it says &quot;remove all 7
engine/transmission mounting bolts.&quot;  The picture clearly shows two bolts
going through the bellhousing and into the cast Al sump.  Another picture
shows the intermediate plate having seven holes.  (The int. plate is that
copper-colored sheet metal that fits between the block and flywheel.) I
remember that the block has five bolt holes. 

Conclusion:  There are seven bolts, two for sump and five for block.
