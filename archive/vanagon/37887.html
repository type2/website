Subject: Sorry, Tires Again?


&lt;&lt; I've got an '89 Westy and its got some 185/??/14 passenger car tires on it.
Not good, but they were on it when I got it a couple of years ago.  I'm in the
market for tires and I'd like to get something bigger.  Like 205/70's
I know they'll fit, but aren't they too wide for my 5&quot; wide steel wheels.

   I also have an '89 Westy on which the PO had replaced recommended tires with
Sears LT's non-reinforced 185x70.  After ignoring the recommendations of the
mechanic who inspected the vehicle for me, after a while I realized that
replacing them was a necessity.  It handled like a pig above 55MPH and in windy
conditions or when being passed by a semi, it was a genuine white-knuckle
experience.

   On the remommendation of an NTW salesman I replaced these with reinforced
Michelin MXL 205x70's. These fit on the original wheels, and the wider footprint
is an advantage.  The price each was $76.00, the total for balancing, disposal
and tax was $341.78.

   These tires make all the difference in the world as far as handling in winds
etc, on dry pavement.  In rain they are ok, in my opinion.  They wear well too;
I've put 33,000 miles on them with no trouble.   Since I live in Altlanta, I
can't speak for handling in snow or ice.  I'd buy another set unless someone can
show me something better.
