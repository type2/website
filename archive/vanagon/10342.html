Subject:       In heat now, '87 Westy on horizon

I'm so excited!  Next Tuesday I'm meeting a guy to look at his '87.  
Now get this-- he's having a compression test done by the dealer that 
morning per my request!  We are gonna split the cost of the test 
whether I buy or not (fair enough for me) but I think it's great just 
to have that info before buying.

Does someone have the 'specs' on compression for a 2.1L  per VW?  I know the real 
world ones run around 110psi (low end) on up but I'm curious as to 
what the actual spec is.

TIA --  Dan
