Subject:   Vanagon Intermittent Misfire

Condition:
  After driving for 1/2 to 2 hours at a constant speed, vehicle
  experiences lack of power, cuts-out or stalls, often accompanied by
  bucking or jerking of the vehicle.
  In ALL cases, the vehicle will restart immediately.  This symptom may
  not re-occur for several weeks/months.  Inspection by the dealer
  results in nothing conclusive.

  Some air-flow meters may experience a vibration resonance of the
  metering potentiometer wiper during extended constant driving.  This
  resonance causes the air-flow meter to supply an intermittent signal
  to the Digifant ECU.  The ECU will then default to a &quot;no-load&quot;
  condition and reduce the injection time.

Service
  Harness, Part No. 025 906 302, is available to resolve this condition.
  * remove electrical connector from air flow sensor (see figure 24-174)
  * install converter assembly, Part No. 025 906 302, between harness
    and air flow sensor

CAUTION
  Part numbers are for reference only.  Always check with your Parts
  Department for latest parts information.

Note
  If customer complaints persist after performing the above repair,
  contact your Zone Product Support Specialist (TSM in Canada).
