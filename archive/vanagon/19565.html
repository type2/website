&gt; I have been plagued with problems with my '82 Diesel Vanagon's starter; today
&gt; I will have to put on my third in two years!  The selonoid seems to give-out
&gt; eventually, and won't engage the starter.  Anybody out there equally
&gt; frustrated?

When I first brought NuBus ('82 Bunker Burner) home, I was a real 
Vanagon Rookie. The starter selenoid was shot, so I brought it into
the shop to fix. They replaced the starter, and charged me the fair
_retail_ price ($250.00) plus labor.  Only later did I find the
Recycled Inc. catalog. Could have saved &gt;$100!  And the starter is 
an easy job. 

Of course, then I got the seals fixed, and then the engine blew up, and
then a replacement engine, and then the timing belt broke and I 
bought a head-job....Of course, I have had *no* problems since
last autumn...(hence the lack of postings....)
