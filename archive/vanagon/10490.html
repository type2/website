&gt;Is this the new official vanagon sport?  Will  a head-banging event be
&gt;held during GNATT?  Do we all crawl under a bus, do we stand in a circle
&gt;and lean in fast, or just against the side of a bus?  Are there bonus points
&gt;for synchronization?  and finally,
&gt;What is the sound of one head banging?

1. no. the only 'official vanagon sports' are:
       Grit Slinging,
       Possum Tossing,
       and Pfeiffer Flannel Flipping.
       Solar Showering is only 'official' during Summer months.
2. no. it's hard enough for them little teenie weenie gnats to SEE each
       each other, much less butt heads.
3. no, no, no, no.
4. no. syncros do not get bonus points.
5. i thought everyone knew that: DONK!
