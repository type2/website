&gt;Subject: '5? Barndoor UPDATE

&gt;Hi everyone,
&gt;      I still havn't taken the 10 hour trip to pick up my new bus.  Maby next
&gt;week.
&gt;      The guy I'm buying it from did find the VIN number:  20-029 105
&gt;Can anyone tell me anything about my bus by this number?  Could it be a late
&gt;'51?
&gt;                                                 Later,
&gt;                                                        Eric
My source shows that &quot;units produced up to the end of of
each year&quot; for October 1952 with serial number 20-035 112.
Your bus is 6,007 short of that.  I don't recall how many a
day they were producing in '51, but my guess is that yours
was made in the summer of '51.  That close enough?
