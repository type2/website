Subject:      Boy did we have an adventure today

Hi Vanafriends!
Got my Carat back with a nice shiny bumper! It looks like new! and...

Interesting adventure today ....

On our way to Ontario airport to pick up mom, we hit a little plastic
thingy on the freeway. Ok, it shattered but we're ok.
Here we go around the interchange and whoah! Red light &amp; buzzer! oil
pressure is down! So I stopped immediatly &amp; parked the van on the
side. Im dreading the worst!
Granpa's of to use the call box and I checked the oil, it's still in
there and no leaks. The owner's book said to check it &amp; try the
engine..hec, I wasn't taking any chances so we towed MrEd to the
closest gas station where they put him up on the racks &amp; checked the
underside..maybe the oil sender was knocked off or something. Nope!
Nothing! Looked fine. Engine sounded fine also! No more light &amp;
noise!
I noticed a little bit of damage it did though, my body trim panel on
the right side just beind the side door got just slightly scraped and
my horn was bent. So on our way an hour late and MrEd was fine &amp;
dandy. I don't get it. He's still running just fine.

Later we figured it was this one gradual hill we climbed on the
freeway, a little hard for the engine with the A/C going? It somehow
made us loose a bit of pressure and the warnings activated....


Has anyone had something odd like this happen?
