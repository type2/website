Subject: Continuing Saga of '87 Wolfs electrics

'Continuing Saga of '87 Wolfs electricals.'
We left off with me looking for how the 'main feed' line
into the fuse panel was not getting to the fuse panel, even
tho this wire is hot and plugged in.
I took the fuse panel out, to discover where the 'main feed'
went inside the fuse panel box. I opened the box and sure
enough, there was a SINGLE LARGE contact where the 'N' wire,
(the main feed wire) goes to the rest of the fuse panel.
This contact went to a fuse/relay box in postition 2'
(Bentley), an eight pin fuse/relay box.
The problem is, there never was a box there, or my memory is
faulty and I lost that fuse/relay box. So, you can quit
reading now.
A possible solution is that VW research and development came
up with an ingenious, low cost, substitute for this large
eight pin fuse/relay box, probably costing 32.8 Deutchmarks
to produce. I found a cockroach inside the box. It is my
theory that this cockroach was a fusable link inside the
fuse panel that fed the entire car with electricity.
(There's a ready supply of them in the Wolfsburg factory
cafeteria.) 
My moving the fuse panel caused vibrations, which caused the
roach/fusable link to break in half (you all know how
friable roaches are.) Thus, I'll have to purchase an
expensive fuse/relay box and maybe that will work.
 
(No help from anybody yet, I could sure use some.)
