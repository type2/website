Subject: Disconnecting Syncro Drive Shaft
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 1997 15:04:56 -0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)

Hi Syncronauts,

I have a friend with a Syncro Vanagon but is having 
problems with his driveshaft.  He would like to disconnect 
it for a few weeks until he gets some time to fix it.

Are there any problems in having this shaft disconnected 
and the van being driven for a few weeks/months??

I remember seeing something possteda while back but I have 
searched the archives and have not found it.

Thanks
Tony
