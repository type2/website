&gt; My question: the long double wire extending from the sender to the gauge
&gt; looks a bit short to me. But the guy on the phone said that it should not
&gt; be shortened or lengthened because this would change resistance and hence
&gt; affect the reading; the gauge is calibrated for that length. 

He is correct.  Mine fit okay even though it looked too short.  Be
careful of the wire where it goes through the engine tin.  Mine was
rubbing and eventually the gauge started reading erratically (too high,
believe it or not).  Make sure you have a rubber grommet or something
to protect it.

&gt; I'm also intrigued by the fact that there are only 2 terminals on the back
&gt; of the gauge. Were does the contraption get its juice? (Does this have
&gt; anything to do with David Carment's battery draining sender?) 

The sender supplies it.  I don't remember the details, but it requires no
external power source.  Kind of nice... I wish they were all that way.  :)
