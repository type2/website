Subject: Awning extension

     Do any subscribers in the UK know where I can buy an awning that can 
     attach to the side of my camper.
     
     Also anyone know anything about those cycle racks and which are 
     good/bad designs to go with our aircooled VW's.
     
     I am planning a tour of West coast of Ireland this summer and these 
     things should increase the fun ratio
