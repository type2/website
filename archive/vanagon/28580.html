Subject: waved at a Ford today

Well I was tooling around Ann Arbor this morning 
(yes it been in the 20's and no my grand bus
insulation project (Step One:  get some interior
panels) is not finished)) and saw this '60's Ford
van with a camper poptop coming the other direction.
I could tell the driver was checking out my bus
so I gave him a wave.  :) 

On another note, there are few things more fun
than stuffing a whole bunch of happy musicians
(a big piece of mine was played tonight) in your
bus and giving them a ride somewhere.
