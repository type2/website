Subject:      substitute for Freon R-12 ...

in the new issue of Import Service magazine, April 1996, there is this
little blurb/ad by Pennzoil:

&quot;Cost-Efficient Substitue For Freon Now Available

Pennzoil has begun distributing a very cost-efficient substitute for Freon.

Freon, or R-12, was banned effective January 1, 1996, by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). The new product, FRIGC FR-12(tm), is the only
SNAP-approved alternative to R-12. SNAP is an acronym for the EPA's
&quot;Significant New Alternative Policy.&quot;

Pennzoil is the master distributor for FR-12, which is manufactured by
InterCool Energy Corporation (ICE), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Intermagnetics General Corporation. The distributorship is for all of the
United States, Canada and Mexico. FR-12 provides the same cooling level as
R-12 and can be used in any air conditioning system designed for R-12.

The most common alternative to R-12 in new vehicles has been a product
called R-134a. But most vehicles manufactured before 1992, and many
manufactured between 1993 and 1994, were designed for R-12 and cannot use
R-134a without being retrofitted which can be costly.

The EPA banned R-12 because it contained chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) which
damage the ozone layer. FR-12 refrigerant is a practical, low-cost
alternative and it is nonflammable and nontoxic.

For more information on FRIGC FR-12, call Dale Wells at (713) 546-4839.&quot;

that's all there is, and that's all i know. i had not heard of this before.
i wonder how long it'll take to get out into the stores. and if they'll let
the ordinary citizens buy it.
