Subject: Re: ever taken a cat on a camping trip?

Sami,
        I had to laugh when I read you note about taking the cat along on your
camping trip. My wife was just saying that maybe we should take our cat with 
us on a trip. Our cat thinks she is human, she is one of the family, where we
go she goes, so I would have no worries taking her along. The only problem I
would have would be her trying to sit on my shoulder (her favourite place )
while I was driving.
        Unless you cat is like this, I wouldn't recommend it, especially if it
 has been declawed, if it got lost or ran off it could't defend itself. Cats 
 are different to dogs, in that not all of them come back when you call them.
Cheers
