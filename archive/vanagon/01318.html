Subject: Re: Who started this Mess??


&gt;
&gt;Ralf and Jim work on their buses,
&gt;Wearing panties and a braaaaar,
&gt;Neither one of them has much money,
&gt;so their clothes are be-low par.
&gt;
&gt;Mike went camping in the mountains
&gt;Where the 4 by 4's do roam.
&gt;Viscious critters ate his brake lines,
&gt;Had to drag a log back home.

Ric's had dozen veedubs or more
And 4 or 5 still on Mars 
Suprised his wallets' not more sore,
&gt;From all those little cars.

Alright.  Not Mars, but you try to find a ryhme for 'cars'.
I *wish* it was Friday now.  I can hear my bus a-callin'.
:-)
