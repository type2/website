Subject: Lack of clutch action

While I was out tonight the clutch in my 83 vanagon quit working. I 
cannot shift into any gears, the clutch will not disengage. I crawled 
under the van and can see the slave cylinder move the acutating rod. The 
bently manual does not give a distance the rod should travel.

Question: is the slave cyl. bad,or is it the master cyl or something 
entirly less easy to change? I rebuilt the slave cyl about a year ago. 
&gt;From looking at the cyl tonight there does not appear to be fluid 
leaking.

No other problems shifting prior to tonight and as far as I remember no 
ugly noises from the trans area.

Any help will be appreiated.
