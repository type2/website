Subject: Re: the lure of the Syncro

I have a non westie syncro  and from my experience and from the checking
around I've done , the tranny goes between 110K and 130K  ,  mine went at
123k 
it cost me 4000$ to fix  I guess if you do it yourself you can get a tranny
for around 2500$   also they tend to need more repairs   but  they are
enduring
