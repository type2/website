Subject:      Body work

Hello all,

Within the next week or so, I plan on undertaking the monumental task of
performing the necessary body work on my '84 westy.   This involves pulling
a few dents, striping the body/seam rust off, and repainting.  Needless to
say, I have no experience in performing this type of work, so any
information would be great.  More specifically, I was wondering about the
best way to take off the rust and if anyone knows of a 'less expensive'
paint sprayer that would work well.   Also, I have some (two very small
spots) rust forming under the rubber strip around one of the rear side
windows.  Has anyone taken out one of these windows to remove rust and if so
how did you do it?

Thanks,
Mike D.
