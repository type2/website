Subject: Kids Review Red Rock

As the Red Rock trip has been amply recounted already, I will not review the 
sequence of events or attendees again, but I would like to mention just a 
couple of things from Nikki's and Siena's point of view. 

First of all, they had a great time! The high point of the trip for them was
the adventure&lt;s&gt; to the Burro Schmidt tunnel. They both think that Jack Stafford
and David Schwarze are off-road driving gods, since neither of them got stuck. 
I have been informed that, had I been driving, we would have _for sure_ gotten
stuck. Kudos also go to Bob for the &quot;Roof-Cam&quot; shots with the video camera. 

A new statement of the affirmative around the house is &quot;Burn the F***er&quot;. It
gets a giggle from the three of us that were there - nods of disapproval from
others who just don't get it. 

David Schwarze and Bradley both got special mention for being &quot;cool guys&quot; and I
think that David gets the honors for &quot;weekend role model&quot; because of his antics
with the propane torch and beer bottles and his appreciation for the RC 
cars. I believe the quote was: &quot;I'm interested in anything that can get that
much wheelspin......&quot;. Siena worries that Bradley may be drinking to much &lt;?!&gt;.
Special thanks go to Steve Johnson, who shared his campsite with us and to 
Jack Stafford who drove us on the &quot;desert adventure&quot;. 

On my own behalf, I would like to say Thank You to everyone for a wonderful 
weekend - the Kautz contingent had a great time.


Dave
