Subject: hole saw

Sean asks about the hole saw he needs, to drill the hole for his new VDO
gauge.  Yes, you can get it at Sears, but you won't like the price.  And
you may have trouble with the plate you are drilling, which if I recall
has a little chrome doodad in the middle and stamped decoration all over.
Maybe best to cut a new blank plate out of sheet metal and install the
gauge in that, and save the original for if you ever want the dash to
look stock again.

Whatever you drill the hole in, clamp it really well to some scrap wood
and be careful to hold the drill nicely perpendicular to the work.

Good luck,
B.
