So Perry,Clay says:
&gt; As I continue on my odyssey of discovery on the peoples camper I find 
&gt;  things on this pancake motor that seem, well, difficult. The most 
&gt;  current displeasure is replacing the points, what sort of a magnetic 
&gt;  contortionist to you have to be to get every thing setup right? Is 
&gt;  there a secret 0 clearance right angle screwdriver I need? Do you pull 
&gt;  the distributor to get to all the screws on the perimeter off the 
&gt;  housing ie: the screw that holds the wire grommet in place is 
&gt;  impossible to get to. And last - does a electronic point replacement 
&gt;  system, like the Pertronix (?) unit work in this distributor?
&gt; 

I think I used to take off the air cleaner and then reach down from the
top with a 10mm box end to loosen the bolt.  I alternated the end back
and forth to get the teeth of the wrench on for a longer turn.

After I got it loose, I just took the whole distributor out noting 
the rotor position first.  Changed the points and condensor and then
put the schmutz back in, reposition and tight the bolt.  Checked the
dwell then the timing.

Re: Pertronix.  Yes it does work on your setup.
And well worth it to avoid this hassle altogether.

Cheers!
