&gt; seriously, always comes with the practical info of which
&gt; bullets its proof against. 22 Short? Sure, NATO .308? maybe
&gt; Russian 7.62 X 39mm? maybe. .415 Weatherby? Probably not.
&gt; 30mm depleted uranium GAU-8? No way. 
&gt; 120mm smoothbore penetrator?? Come on!

During the gulf war we shot an Iraqi Vanagon with a TOW 
anti-tank missile--it wasn't bulletproof....

Gives new definition/meaning to the term &quot;Overkill&quot; -- did the warhead
detonate or couldn't it find anything solid enough to set it off?   (Seriously
folk there are examples in WWII of destroyers being hit by 14&quot; battleship
shells, only reason the ship didn't immediately cease to exist was that they
were armor piercing shells and fuses.  The destroyer was too flimsy to set off
the fuse and/or slow down the shell so that the shell went right through the
ship and went into and or detonated in the water on the far side of the ship)
