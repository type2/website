Subject: CV joint repacking-'85 Westy

     
     I've been thinking about repacking the CV joints and after looking in the 
     Bentley came away a little confused about the axle removal process.
     
     Maybe someone can clear this up for me so that I don't get in a bind while 
     under the vehicle.
     
     The question is: Once the bolts are removed holding the inner cvj to the 
     final drive/differential, will the complete assembly(inner cvj, axle, and 
     outer cvj) pull out, as if on a spline? or are there similar bolts(to those 
     holding the inner cvj) on the outer cvj that need to be removed?  If so, 
     how does one access them?
     
     Bentley shows the parts explosion, but doesn't explain the process.
     
     Thanks in advance,
     
     Pat Spragge
