Subject: Az Bus Club to Vote on NEATO affiliation~tonight.

Voice your support if affected!

The Arizona Bus Club has grown into one of the most active bus clubs in the
SW USA and *the* strongest TypeII club in Arizona. This club has remained
&quot;independant&quot; from or non-affiliated with any other national or
international clubs. 

Tonight the Arizona Bus Club will vote on whether to become affiliated with
NEATO. Many ABC members are email readers and are located outside of the
Phoenix, AZ area. Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend tonights vote
and cannot fwd your support to the Board members. I urge all members of
either/both clubs and interested parties to call the list of board members
listed below to voice your support of this move. I already have done so.

I strongly support NEATO.
I strongly support the AZ Bus Club.
The affiliation between the two will/may benefit both clubs.
The independant spirit of the ABC will not be diminished by the affiliation.
I embrace all movements to include current members of the smaller non-active
Phoenix based bus club into the ABC if they desire to do so.
