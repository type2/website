Doug,

On my 86 westy we have had a real time with the trim pieces, all over the
van they have shrunk and have warped. just think of a roller coaster ride
as you drag your hand over them. There are certain spots where the trim is
worse than others.
Really bad spots:
1: Across the tray at the rear door, down the cabinet edge.
2: Across the bottom of the cupboard above rear seat.

shrunk also at most spots, I at one time was going to remove, heat up to
re-stretch and put back in but upon attempt to remove it was not going to
come out with a fight. So I just left it, look junky, what else can you do?

&gt; Is anyone else experiencing shinking plastic trim pieces on their
Westfalia
&gt; interiors.  It seems that around all the openings and the edges of the
&gt; tables and stove/sink covers the edging is slowly getting smaller
exposing
&gt; the plywood.  I was wondering if it is from heat or is time the enemy?
Is
&gt; there anything that can be done to slow the process, or can this material
be
&gt; replaced?  Just trying to keep it looking new for as long as possible.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
