I have a GEX rebuilt engine also and I am wondering if the noise I am
hearing is the Tappets as Douglas has discussed. The engine ticks
occasionally when climbing.

             Jared,
             I have a 1986 syncro with a GEX engine, about 5,000
             mile on it. It has developed a tap. The tap to me sounds
             like an exhaust leak. This was easy to check, just use
             a rag over your hand to plug the tail pipe as the motor
             idles. The motor will ether stall or the leak will 
             become obvious. Unfortunatly mine stalled. This weekend 
             I'm going to look into other things that would cause 
             this. My next guess is a vacumme leak right at the head.
