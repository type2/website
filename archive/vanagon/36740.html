&gt; But I didn't like it. I know bearing material (in the rods, in this case)

&gt; you're just tapping, if it's enough force to push that pin through it's got

&gt; bearing.

Yup.  I don't like that either.
 
&gt; Has anybody pressed the pins in with a huge C-clamp or something? Am I
&gt; being too prissy here?

That's exactly what I do.  I have an approx. 18&quot; C-clamp which, combined
with blocks of wood (and an appropriately sized deep socket if you are
removing the pins) works nicely.  BTW, my method of doing this if the
pins are really tight is to tighten the clamp a little and then barely
tap the end of the clamp with a screwdriver.  The pin will slip in
allowing you to tighten the clamp a little more.  I figure it's a little
less stressful that way.
