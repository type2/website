Subject: Re: Putting Side Rocker Mouldings on Westy?

Ron,

My 90 Westy doesn't have the side panels.   Looks like they would interfere
with filling the propane tank.

&gt;I bought a used set of side rocker panel mouldings off a '91 Vanagon, which
&gt;I plan to put on my '89 Westy.   These are the plastic mouldings that
&gt;attach to the rockers and hang down a few inches below the body, found on
&gt;later-year Vanagons.
&gt;
&gt;My question is, were these mouldings originally used on any Westies, or
&gt;just on the multivan campers (without propane)?  If they weren't originally
&gt;used on Westies, has anyone else put them on a Westy? I'm wondering whether
&gt;there will be enough clearance to fill the propane tank, or whether I'll
&gt;have to modify the drivers side moulding if I ever want to have propane
&gt;again.  The reason for my confusion is that a customer stopped by with a
&gt;'91 Westy, and his did not have the mouldings.
