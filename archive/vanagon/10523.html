Subject: Re: Wacky Warning light

&gt;My 84 Vanagn GL has a problem. 
&gt;
&gt;When starting the VW up, all the idiot lights go on then off, no problem.
&gt;After warming the vanagon up for a bit. I start driving. When i come to the 
&gt;first stop sign (about 1,500 yds), the water warning light starts flashing and 
&gt;the needle shoots off toward the right. I start driving again and the light
&gt;goes out, 
&gt;and the needle falls all the way (no recording of &quot;actual&quot; water temp.) When
&gt;I stop again 
&gt;at a light or something and then start off again the process repeats.

After owning my '85 Jetta GL for three months, I had the same problem.  In
the winter, no less.  It was warranty work at the time, of course, and
replacing a temperature sender took care of it.
