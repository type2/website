Hey folks,

My acclerator cable is sticking when it is cold...Last year it never did
this (even at -30F).  This year it does it at any point below freezing...

How do I fix it?  Is there a lubricant that can be applied with cable still
on the van?  Where is it most likely freezing up ?...

Thanks,

Mark
