Subject: Re: Syncro 16&quot; wheels?

Last weekend my itty-bitty 27x8.5x14 s got stuck in a clay mudhole
(I'll post a full report once I have the photos) and I was thinking
about those 16s as well.

Malcomb's question got me off my duff to locate the road test
of the turbodiesel 16&quot; syncro that my wife translated, with Derek's
comments, last year. I thought the article might directly answer some of 
the his technical questions regarding body clearance, and while it is 
interesting, it does not. 

&gt;From conversations with Derek, I think another problem is what the 
circumference of these tires does: you need to lower the final drive 
ratio to compensate for the tire size. Suitable parts were made for the
16&quot; version, but the availabilty and cost are unknown, at least by me.

Anyway, I put a link to the 16&quot; road test on the Syncro Westie page,
