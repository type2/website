&gt;The odometer is precisely what you need to watch --
&gt;and keep a notebook handy recording purchases &amp; readings.  I'm thinking of
&gt;buying a cheap hand-counter (like the kind used to tick-up grocery
&gt;purchases) to help me.  This should hold you 'till you figure out what to do
&gt;about that gauge.  (Unfortunately your Bus doesn't have a reserve tank
&gt;switch, either. . .)

Yeah, when I first bought the bus I looked all over for the reserve tank
lever...!
&lt;short story now&gt;   One sunny afternoon I was merrily putting across the Bay
Bridge to Oakland in my '69 Bug when &gt;sputtter, sputter, sput..&lt;   I ran out
of gas (I had pulled the reserve somewhere back in SF - days ago??).  Well,
sitting alongside the freeway, wondering what to do NOW, up pulls a biker
CHP.  He leans into my window and says in his stern, official cop voice -
 &quot;You KNOW this is a High Crime??&quot;  I blanched - ohmigod what have I done? Am
I going to jail now? Jeez!
&quot;....running out of gas in a *VW*, that is...&quot; sez he, smiling broadly!  He
then called for a gas can, I was on my way.  I NEVER ran out of gas again in
that bug!
