Subject: Ball Joint boot seals.
Date: Mon, 21 Aug 95 12:11:42 MDT

Does anyone know where I can get a set of ball joint boot seals?  That is the 
rubber bellows that seals the ball joints on the '68 through 79 fromnt 
suspension.  I can get the whole joint , including the seals, from a jobber 
for CAN$~ 35 but the only source that i can find for the seals is VW and they 
want the same for just the seal.  I don't actually want to replace the ball 
joints since I have a good set already pressed into the suspension arms off 
of a wreck.  I want to just swap the suspension arms as a unit since they have 
almost zero play in them but the seals arestarting to crack.  Don't want to do 
the work and have them fail in a year and I really want to avaid the press 
work and much pounding needed to replace the joints in toto.

Thanks in advance
