Subject: Thanks for everything everybody!

I would like to thank everyone for all of their help in the past with my
problems on my '71 bus.  Due to a new job and somewhat chaotic schedule, I
have not been able to watch my e-mail lately.  I used to use my sister's
computer but as I no longer have access to it, I will have to unsubscribe
to the Vanagon list.  (Everytime I log on, there are over 1500 messages
waiting for me! No kidding!)

I am still having the occasional problems here and there (see other post)
but so far I've logged about 1500 miles on Lola with no problem.

To those of you who wrote to me about my Volksaddict page, don't worry, I
actually spent countless hours editing a new edition.  Soon it will be
available for the masses. (uh, like in 1997...?)

So, until I'm on the list again, good luck everybody! (I can still access
mail through my girlfriend's computer lab at her school.)

Bye for now!!

Regards,

John Smythe
