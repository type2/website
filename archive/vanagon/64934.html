 I guess if a new one lasts me another 15 years I'll be okay. Any
 comments from any Dieselees? Has this happened to anyone else.

Hasn't happened to me yet, but thanks for the &quot;heads up&quot;. Lots of other

have just accepted it as the trade-off for the super fuel economy and
longevity of the motor itself.
