Scott said, I think, that VW buses are hard to find where he is?  Not too 
hard in Minnesota.  There are half a dozen ads every day for oldies (but 
hopefully goodies), from about 69's on up.  Prices range from $400 (need 
work) to $28,000 (Eurovan with 9,000 miles on it; camper--isn't that 
overpriced?  A new one can be had here for $27,500).  
   Are VW's cheaper here in Minnesota than elsewhere?  Maybe because it's 
cold in a VW in winter, at least in my old ones?  I've seen ads on the 
West coast that tempted me to buy VWs here, drive them there and sell them!
