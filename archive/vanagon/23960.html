Subject:       Leaving for a while...

Hi Everyone.  I'm gone for the month of September, so I'm 
unsubsuscribing from the list... or trying to!

I'll be back in October.  We're going back to the Rockies for about 
2.5 weeks, and then will spend 1.5 weeks in the Okanagan district of 
BC.  It's sunny and dry right now.. unlike 3 weeks ago when we got 
rained out.  Looking forward to lots of hiking and r &amp; r.

My WWW page and email should be active during this time.

Have fun,
Harry
