i think this would probably be the most reasonable solution. in fact, you
could bet a duplicate antenna and put on the RIGHT corner of the front
bumper, and tell everyone that they (antennas) were those &quot;feeler&quot; rods
that the big trucks have (to tell where their front bumpers are)!! :)

this should work ok, but you'll have to remember that because all the mass
of the car is behind and to the right of the antenna, that your &quot;best&quot;
transmitting will go off in that direction (back toward your left rear
corner).  but for ranges of 2-3 miles or so, it probably won't make any
difference.

and the bigger antenna is better, anyway.
