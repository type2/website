Subject: '85 engine replacement

Fellow Wacoolies:

After 170,000 miles it is now time to replace the liquid puncher.  I 
have been quoted about $2350 for a factory 1.9 longblock.  It seems that 
installation can run up to $1200.  This seems sort of high for the 
installation labor.  (of course this is dealer labor rates.)  What is a 
reasonable cost for replacement??  Question #2:Can a 2.1 be substituted, 
or were there too many changes in '86.  Thanks for any input.

Jon
