Subject: I need help with this vacuum hose...

hey now,

i posted this before but got no response...(are you folks tired of me already?
hehehehehe)...i have a vacuum hose that was broke in two. i replaced it with
a new one. the van will not idle at all tho the brakes work fine now. i'm
thinking this is because the ppo adjusted the carb (which he installed
backwards) to make up for the vacuum leak. does this make sense? i'd like to
fix this but don't know quiet what to do. the van will run if you keep giving
it gas and runs great going down the highway but quits as soon as the gas
pedal is let out.

thanks!

jonathan
