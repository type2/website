I have used an &quot;iron&quot; with good results. Actually the iron in this case
was small hand-held device for waxing skiis, but  an iron will work as
well. The trick is to have the heat high enough to melt the glue but not
the wallpaper. Actually our  wallpaper is soi bad in places the iron justt
tacked in back in place.

Also a guy at  a campsite had used a spray-on &quot;stucco&quot; paint as a
substitute with good results....he sprayed over the paper.
