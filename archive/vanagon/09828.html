Subject: Attention Closet '59 Panel Owners

I have found a '59 Panel with an owner that is very willing to sell, and thought
I'd post it here. It's somewhat of a project, but is *close* to running so I've 
been told. The owner is asking $275, but she really just wants it gone. It's in 
the bay area, Mt. View to be exact. I don't have any vested interest...just 
trying to provide a little temptation.... My driveway/parking lot is too full 
for me (and SO) to consider...

If anyone is interested, I can post more details and phone numbers. Otherwise, 
well, perhaps its off to the crusher.
