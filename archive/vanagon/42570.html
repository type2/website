Subject: Re: Safari Windows

     &gt;Well, I've had these Wolfgang safaris a total of 2 days, and broke 2 
     &gt;latches already.  I've closed them 3 times in the whole time I've had 
     &gt;them.
     &gt;
     &gt;Not very good averages, IMHO
     &gt;
     &gt;I'm s'posed to be able to get new latches for free, but we'll see. 
     &gt;(BTW - I beleive these latches are different from the &quot;real&quot; safari 
     &gt;window latches.)
     
     I've found that it was not necessary to have the latches pull the 
     windows in real tight in order to seal the frames. I have set mine so 
     that they just pull the window lightly onto the body seal. I bolted 
     the dash clips on instead on welding them so that I could adjust them 
     once i'd fitted the windows.
