Subject: 89 Westy with crazy German Blaupunkt radio.


The new-to-me 89Westy (no name yet, although it might become &quot;Box of Rain&quot;)
has a Blaupunkt radio, with what I believe is German dials. I cannot figure
it out! Can someone refer me to a source?

There is a &quot;PCI&quot; button, that randomly interrupts the radio and displays
&quot;PCI&quot; on the digital LED.  Also an ARI button? ....

Also cannot change or regulate sound from front to rear speakers.



Thanks.

Louise
