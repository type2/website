Subject: Re: Attn: Mr. Derek Drew : 4x4 Vanagon

&gt; 	My name is sudhir desai, and currently I have an '84 RWD Vanagon.
&gt; since it is getting old and decrepid, I was surfing the net to find some 
&gt; information on vanagons when I saw and read your article on your 4x4 
&gt; Vanagon Camper.  I was wondering if you could give me some informaiton 
&gt; about how I can purchase a new / relatively new 4x4 Vanagon.

Forgive the intrusion...

New T3 - Vanagon Syncro (AWD), go to South Africa.  New AWD VW 'van' get a 
European made Transporter - T4 called Eurovan over here.  Are they 
importing any AWD T4s into Canada?
