So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Am considering using something like a suede cloth, a vellux
&gt; blanket-type material, or perhaps even polyester fleece for
&gt; insulation, sound reduction, etc.  Has anyone had any experience
&gt; with this, and if so, can you recommend an adhesive?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

What?!? Your interior is not going to be wall-to-wall/floor-to-ceiling
flannel?  I VERY disappointed.   ;)

I'm wondering if you couldn't use velcro with the sticky side against
the roof and velcro on the material and then just stick the two to-
gether?
