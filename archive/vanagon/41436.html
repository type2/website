Subject: I've been de-flowered

        Well its now official. I am finally, after a seven year love
affair, a VW Westfalia owner. I purchased a 1983 Westie from Tony Schiebel,
whom you may have seen on here before, this past weekend. I cant even begin
to tell you how elated I am. I spent pretty much the whole weekend sitting
inside it getting aquainted with my new love. I was in awe when I
discovered that the driver and passenger seat actually rotate! I think I
probably put the pop top up total of 10 - 15 times, which roughly equates
to the amount of friends who dropped by to take a peek at it. :)
        I just wanted to thank everyone who had replied to my &quot;help me buy
a van&quot; post a while back. I got alot of useful information from everyone,
and although I couldnt find some &quot;fabulous&quot; out-of-town deal on a Westie, I
think I got just about the best deal around thanks to Tony. He took great
care of it, and put my mind at ease by showing me every thing that had been
done to it over the past 4 - 5 years.
        I even like the color of the damn thing! That was just a bonus.

        So now that I spent the weekend going over it, I have a few questions:
1) Where would be the best place to put another batteryin if I wanted to
have a batttery hooked up just for the camper part?

2) The drivers side head cushion adjuster doesnt work. The head cushion
part is fine, none of the grooves have been maimed or anything but I think
the post inside the seat may be stripped or something. Whats the best way
to get the post out of there to check it?

3) The rear window washer pump only trickles out a titny bit of fluid and
doesnt 'squirt' it all over the window. I treid taking a pin and cleaning
the valve hole but nothing changed? Any suggestions?

        Thats enough for now I guess. Thanks again.

Elated VW owner
