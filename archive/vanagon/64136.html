Recent postings on this subject suggest difficulties are occurring at the 
Vanagon chat site.  I managed to get what I presume is an avatar, it was a
picture of a Vanagon and I picked a nickname.  Initially when I visited the
site no-one was ever there.  (I changed my deodorant and had a shower but
still no-one there!!!!)  Now I can't even get into the chat room (Ozzie go
home).

Has anyone been successful in chatting at the site?  If so, tell us your
secret.
