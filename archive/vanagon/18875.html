&gt; Bob (or anyone): is there a minimum oil pressure necessary to operate
&gt; hydraulic lifters? In other words why do lifters work at idle when
&gt; pressure is only 10psi?

Along this thought, has anyone ever seen/owned/worked on one
of Bernie Bergman's hydraulic conversion, they have been doing them
for damn near 10 years now, long as anybody, and seem to do the
right stuff, ie. increase oil galley size, drill more oil galleys, etc
all for $250 or so in recent ads.  I've been thinking once I round
up some money on building a either a 1776 or 1904 cc for the Westy,
and I have a real low miles universal case from a friends wrecked
Type 3 so I was considering having Bergman do his wonders on it,
then build her myself.  I ask at this time because they install that
ball bearing oil pressure control valve and claim it stabilizes
pressure nicely between idle and running, something like 35 at idle
or something comes to mind.  So does anyone know if it works? is
the quality good? etc?
