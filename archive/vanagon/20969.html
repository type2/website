Subject:       wasserboxer exhaust repair

No miracle cure in this post... just some common problems and a 
little bit of life extending hope.

As we all unfortunately know, the wasserboxer exhaust is prone to 
cracking, if the rust doesn't get it first.  3 areas i've had repaired 
successfully are:

1. crack in header pipe just at the flange that bolts to the exhaust 
port

2.  crack in header pipe at &quot;Y&quot; junctions

3.  crack in header pipe at front support bracket (present only from 
'86 on)

note:  these cracks were on 3 different vanagons so i wasn't 
inflicted with all this pain on one vehicle...

in each case, the local muffler shops were able to wire-feed 
weld the cracks solid again.  the repair i just had done on the '87 
(a #3 type crack) was done by cutting out the cracked section and 
welding in a new piece of pipe.  this guy's work was pure art.  he 
was good.  $35 and fixed while-u-wait :)

anyway, if most of the exhaust is solid, these crack repairs can get 
you a few more years farther from the inevitable :(  so far, these 
cracks are occuring in areas with relatively solid pipe left.

oh, i've tried the JB Weld stuff too, it just can't stand the heat.

so, don't despair completely-- weld 'dem cracks
