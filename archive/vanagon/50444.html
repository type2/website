&gt;Tim... what seems to be your major malfunction...???

damn! integrity is clouding my outlook again.

&gt;
&gt;	you still upset about him beating you out on that deal several months
&gt;ago...??

????, no deal I am/was aware of, I just note that Kyle of Volksmotors uses a
commercial sig, as does Jim of BusBoys, letting folks know who's what. While
Ron says he's just a guy selling his personal vehicles.


&gt;	let it go man....  the bad karma you're building up ain't worth 

substitute gas for karma and I'm with you man! see ya, tim
