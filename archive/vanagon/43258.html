Subject: Re: Syncro Fan!!!


&gt;&gt;I'm in need of a cooling fan for a Syncro!  I've posted once and only
&gt;&gt;got 1 response.  HELP we all know how important it is to have proper
&gt;&gt;cooling!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   We had coolig problems wth our syncro, especially in traffic jams in 
hot
&gt;weather.  We found out that the automatic fan switch didn't come on soon
&gt;enough, so we installed a manual switch and a water temp guage. The fan is 
a
&gt;2 speed fan, so we put a 3 pole switch in so we can control what speed we
&gt;want. I didn' know the fan has a high speed until I installed this switch.
&gt;It only came on on low speed when it came on automaticly. It still comes on
&gt;automaticly but now I have the option of turning it on when I want(need) 
to.


I've seen this happen with the '80 V6anagon (non-syncro), where its
cooling fan doesn't come on until the temp gets up around 220F or so.
The characteristics of this Chevy V6 engine are different from the
wasserboxer, of course, but it seems they share a common problem here.

Chevy literature says that this is correct operation for this engine
in the Citation it came out of. But I'd still like to see it come on
at a lower temp, say around 190-200.

Interesting note: I recently stopped by the FLAPS-- Kragen Auto Parts
to be exact, aka Checker in the midwest. They have a very interesting
catalog of radiator-fan switches, that includes units for both American
engines (like mine) and imported engines (like all of yours). AND...
the listings include not only the application, but the thread size and
diameter, the turn-on and turn-off temp points, and whether it's a
switch for a fan, or a thermistor type for a gauge.

Neat thing about this, is that I could leaf thru it and find a switch
that fits the Chebby engine, with a lower temp range. If they have one...
and they do, just one, that closes at 204F. Not quite there, but close.
And it's $26. Hmmm.

And... the metric ones have many more available ranges, all the way down
to 180F or so. Don't know what the correct thread size is for the various
VW engines, or whether they have these low-temp switches for that exact
thread. Anyone know what the correct thread size/diameter is for the
wasserboxer and/or diesel engines?

Several wasserboxer and diesel-vanagon owners on this list, have told
me that their cooling fans almost never come on-- just in long traffic
jams, going up long hills at high altitudes, etc. I don't recall how
many of those were syncros, if any.

My $1.02...
