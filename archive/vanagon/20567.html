Speaking of Westfalia insignia.....


does anyone  know if the Westfalia insignia is available from VW or
another parts supplier? Reason: The Westy top was recently painted and the
insignia was covered over. This leaves me with three choices: leave as is;
painstakingly hand paint the insignia back on using the stickers as a
temmplate or put new stickers on...I suppose I could remove the old ones
and try my hand at making new stickers....


On an unrelated item the inside sliding door has been beaten to death and
we are thinking of replacing it as well. What materials wold be best for
the job: plywood? cardboard? kitchen counter top?



TIA - David C.
