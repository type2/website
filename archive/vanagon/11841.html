Subject: throttle valve switch


 Does anyone have experience with making adjustment to the throttle

 valve switch on a 2.1 ?

 I have checked the Bentley book. It seems pretty straight forward.

 This adjustment is important and I wanted to see if anyone has found

 any trick to it..

 I am presently working on several vanagons...

  and they all seem to have had some odd adjustments by their previous

  owners.. I have been to get good results with basically playing around

  with the switch's position...

 But, I want to see if anyone out there had been able to come up with a

  good way to adjust this switch.
