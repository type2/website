&gt;&gt;  I was just under the van and noticed that the coolant pipes
&gt;&gt; on my van are rusting rather badly in the area in which they make the
&gt;&gt; turn  going from under the car to the engine. [In the rear}
&gt;&gt; Has anyone had to replace theirs? If so, how much should
&gt;&gt; I start socking away?

&gt;That was one of things my '84 needed when I bought it back in March.
&gt;I believe the part, just one pipe, was $130 new with labor around $100
&gt;and at that the shop said they lost money on the labor.  It took nearly
&gt;a week to get the part.  It had be flown in from Germany as one could not
&gt;be found anywhere in the states.

any chance you guys could use the later pipes? my 88 doesn't have any metal
pipes at all ... great big mother plastic pipes connected by big mother
rubber hoses.  and the plastic pipes are not even secured too well to the
frame.  just a thought.
