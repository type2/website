hey, you can put the 53 standard microbus back on the list.  actually i drove
it to get a cup of coffee today. 

(i hoped it'd perk up the little bus - 60 kph seemed fast)

did eric and his 52 drop off the list?

and i got rid of two buses yesterday.   he hauled away Moselle, who had been
badly destroyed in a wreck a couple months ago (61 standard turned hippy
camper, toured with the Dead in the 70s), and an early 64 standard micro
rusty bus,  both walk throughs.   i don't know if they were on the list.
