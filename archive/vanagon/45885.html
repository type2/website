Subject: Karmic donations for Veeduber...

All:

It seems even the best plans can (and will) go awry at the worst times.  Bob
sort of reminds me of a Swiss army knife with a little Boy Scout thrown in.
However, he seems adventure prone so I think we should take up a collection
and have everybody donate a little of their good Karma for Bob.  Maybe rub
yer rabbit's feet too...

I doubt if one could prepare for a trip any better but if I had that sort of
luck I'd probably turn into a shut-in!

Good luck, Bob, it's good to have you back.

Bob J.

p.s. My 67 Microbus can barely tow it's own ass let alone a Westy!
