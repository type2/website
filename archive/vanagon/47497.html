Speaking of problems, Gerry Skerbitz is concerned about his fuel pump
as it's making a whining noise because of air in the system.  I recommended
that he 'bite the bullet' and just get one at the dealer as he has to
be in the bay area on Saturday.  He had checked out the local Von Housen
and they told him they'd have to order it. :[  As for you yo-yo's that
have hinted that he should abscond the one from my van.  Well.... may
a herd of way-ward yak leave presents on your lawn.   :p
