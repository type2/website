&gt;also made me 
 &gt;wonder if, in the event of fuel pump failure, the inlet and &gt;outlet lines
&gt; couldn't just be hooked together and the bus be driven &gt;&lt;limping, perhaps&gt;
&gt; with a gravity fed fuel supply to a source of spare parts and &gt;repairs. Has
&gt; anybody tried this?

I've never tried it, but I had the exact same thought when I read the fuel
pump fiasco yesterday.  I bet it would work, but I hope I never have to find
out first hand.
