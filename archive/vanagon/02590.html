Subject: MFA



	I have a wee weekend project that involves adapting
	a MFA (multi function analyzer? - trip computer, oil
	press. gauge, ambient temp gauge, mpg calc), from
	an 85 GTI to my vanagon. 
	My question is: Is the little vacuum sender adjustable?
	and if so, do you think I could adjust it to correct
	the mpg calc?

	Thanks, Alistair
