Subject:      Amazon_dot_com Books, re: A book from Peter Russek Publications,
              Ltd. (fwd)

For all those interested in finding a local source for the Russek book, I
received this e'mail back from Amazon _dot_com.  It didn't turn up the book I
wanted, but perhaps others on the list may find it of use?

Ivan
