Subject: Re: 12 volt heaters?

&gt;I saw a tiny heater that plugged in the cigarette lighter (which isn't 
&gt;used for cigarettes by anybody I can think of). Anyone know if these 
&gt;work? Just to make a warm patch for the feet?
&gt;

I bought one of these right after buying my first bus.  In my opinion, it is
absolutely worthless for the purpose of heating, although it does give off a
lovely orange/redish glow that sets the mood somewhat in the van (lava
lampesque).  I never tried to defrost a windshield with it though I would
doubt it would have much affect.  In 30 deg weather you must push your hand
against the grill of the heater to feel the hint of heat.  I should've read
up on the likelihood of a 12v 30 amp generator producing much heat through
one of these things.  But I was young and foolish...  

Saying this, I have one you can buy for really cheap--I mean, people have
those fake-cellular-status-symbol-phones in their cars--You can point to the
heater and tell your marveling friends you have heat in your bus!
