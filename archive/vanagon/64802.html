Subject:      Re: Vanagon/Transporter

&gt; And in South Africa 'Microbus' and 'Kombi'.  Are these the original
&gt; German names - Helmut?

No, like Vanagon these are South African only names. The 'Kombi' is
used in Germany for convertibles, used as transporter without rear
seats or as bus with rear seats. But there is no label 'Kombi', just
a name found in price lists.

&gt;And on a personal note, Helmut, which ones were and are called &quot;Bulli&quot;? I
&gt;heard and have read a few books about the transporter being called by this
&gt;fabulous name.

Bulli is a nickname for all kind of VW Transporters Type 2 (in the
meaning Type 1 is the bug).
