Someone told me that you need to hold down the bypass button on that
fridge until the red led glows also.  Otherwise the gas will cut off
since the thermocouple will not be hot enough so quickly.

If you look through the sight glass while pumping and sparking, you
should be able to see the ignition before the led glows.  Definately,
though, it makes a Woosh! sound.  That was my first indication ever that
my fridge was working.
