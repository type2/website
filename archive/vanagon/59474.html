&lt;&lt; My dad just purchased a one owner '82 Westy with 78,000 miles.  Everything

 works and is there.  He paid $1,500.00.  $7,900.00 seems a little high to
 me.

me too.   A friend of mine just bought a '80 Vanagon ASI Camper (more camping
stuff than a westy) for a whopping 200 bucks. Has around 80k orig.  Needed
the engine put in. That's it.  Has a gas heater too.
