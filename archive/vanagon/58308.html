Subject: Starter, Pilot Bearing

Hey everyone! Here are some recent problems I am having on the never ending
road to a reliable Vanagon...

Pilot bearing (?) - Lately when sitting at a full stop with the clutch
depressed and the Vanagon in gear, There is an occasional &quot;chunk&quot;ing, which
seems like the clutch is trying to grip. Is this the pilot bearing
seizing?? It's OK once I'm on the Interstate. If so, could anyone give me
some pointers on dropping the tranny? Should I drop both engine and tranny
or just tranny? should I replace the clutch while I'm at it?

Starter - The starter seems weak while cranking. It is getting worse.
Lately, it not even cranking fast enough to start the engine. I've checked
all ground straps and cleaned battery connections, and it is a new battery.
Alternator also seems to be fine and accessories are strong. Is a &quot;tired&quot;
starter a typical way for them to quit? Or is a weak connection likely??
How important is it to replace it w/ a Bosch or will reman. do?
