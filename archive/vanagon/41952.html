&gt; Grab it!
&gt; 
&gt; Toyota engines are the most reliable you can get. Best thing that ever
&gt; happened to the Chevrolet Chevette, is when GM started buying 1.8L
&gt; engines from Toyota and putting them in-- reliability shot upward.

I have to agree with Steve here about the 22R engine.  My parents have a
4Runner with this engine and it is nice.  However, the one in my
parents' car has a timing chain, not a timing belt.  It's an '89.  60K+
miles and only needed a thermostat cause the old one stuck open.
It's a very good engine.  I am kinda interested to know where the
radiator is.
