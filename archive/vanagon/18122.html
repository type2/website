&gt; Recently discussions have been taking place about the creation of a

&gt; place.  The new group should be part of the rec.autos.makers.* tree, and  
&gt; should have separate groups for different types of VW's.

&gt;    rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
&gt;    res.autos.makers.vw.watercooled
&gt;    rec.autos.makers.vw.vanagon
&gt;    rec.autos.makers.vw.misc

How about rec.autos.vw.aircooled
	              .aircooled.van
		      .watercooled
		      .watercooled.van
		      .events
		      .misc
		      .forsale

Since it looks like developing a new group it might as well be split up 
as much as possible. That way one could subscribe by their interests.

  How about OIL cooled as opposed to AIR cooled??????
