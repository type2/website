Subject: Tires - Syncro (frequently discussed)
Date: Fri, 27 Dec 96 15:42:00 CDT


I know there has been a lot of discussion on the list about tires for a 
Syncro, sorry for the possibly redundant posting.

I purchased my 86 Syncro with 2 matching tires on the front and 2 brand new 
matching tires on the rear.  All are 185 75 R14's.   I'm a broke student and 
don't have the money for all 4 but I can afford to replace the front 2. 
 Then all four should match almost exactly, with the exception of about 3000 
miles on the rear tires.

Can I get by replacing the front 2 for the time being and do the rear tires 
in about a month, or will that stress my VC????

Do I have to have the exact same tread wear on all 4 or do they just need to 
be the same size.   If they do need to be exactly the same then I'll have to 
trash the two perfectly good rear tires.

Respond to me directly, I'm frequently bounced off the list due to server 
problems.

Paul
