&gt;I looked in the Bus Stop catalog and they have two different seals
&gt;listed -- a firewall seal and the main engine seal (2 req'd).  The place I
&gt;was at only had one listed for both spots so I bought two.  It just looks a
&gt;flat piece of rubber -- unless it inflates like a life raft I'm gonna have
&gt;some serious air leaks.

You didn't take it out of the package, right? (Can Hooper draw ASCII art in
Eudora? We shall see!)

('67s don't have firewalls, Clara? The engines are in the cargo bay? The
split-window Type II must be a primitive beast indeed!)(Any seal that can't
balance a beach ball on its nose is something up with which I will not put,
even if I have to swat the flywheel.)
