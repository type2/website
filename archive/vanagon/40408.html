Subject: Another lurker comes forward


Hi all.

I've been gratefully absorbing the expertise of this list for weeks now.  I 
bought my first ever VW last Sept. (an '84 Westphalia camper) having no clue 
that I was about to become vanagon fanatic. I adore my Westy. I needed a 
comfortable van to tour the US.  We are moving from Vermont to Portland, Or in 
five weeks.  Once we get our stuff relocated, we plan to make a clockwise trip 
around the US (I need to be back in Vt for a wedding in Aug).

Unfortunatly I am a certified engine idiot.  I must thank you all for giving 
me a much needed quick education in the field of VWs.  I bought a Bentley 
manual and plan to go over my van from front to back to learn as much as I can 
in preparation for the inevitable breakdown.  


The van has been running fairly well.  She has a small oil leak and also is 
leaking coolant.  I have a friend of a friend who is going to take a look at 
the van make sure it is ready for the long haul.  I have been ripped off by a 
local mechanic and am weary of strangers &quot;fixing&quot; anything.  Does anyone know 
of any trustworthy VW mechanics in Vt?  Also, I need the info about the 
Westphalia letters again.  I deleted the info last week and then ran into 
someone looking for the lettering.  If someone could email the info again I'd 
greatly appreciate it.
