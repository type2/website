&gt;BTW:  I was told of a 1978 bus that a guy has for sale about 15 miles 
&gt;south of me.  He wants $100.  It is drivable however, the kid that bought 
&gt;it had to give it back cuz &quot;he couldn't get a title for it.&quot;  If there is 
&gt;a will, there is away.  The only thing I can think of that would make it 
&gt;impossible to get a title is if it was stolen or if there was a lein on 
&gt;it and there isn't.  I think it's simply a lost title in which case a bit 
&gt;of private detective work and some cash would itron this puppy out.  I 
&gt;know cuz I did it before with a bug I got from the salvage yard.  Took me 
&gt;a month but by damn I did it! Okay, enough for now.  I'll post the 
&gt;results of the bus hunt as I don't have room for it even if I did buy 
&gt;it.  I hope someone can rescue it if it ain't in that bad of shape...

 Another way to find out is to give the chassis or engine number (if
original) and ask a police officer to call it in to the NCIC. This should
give the last known owner and the person's address.
