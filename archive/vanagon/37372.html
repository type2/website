They are pretty easy to make.  If you are sewing-challenged I'm sure if you 
bring measurements to any seamstress/upholsterer, it wouldn't cost you 
much.  Also, this way you get a real choice of material.

Caron and I made some this past weekend.  The only thing we have left to do 
is find snaps for the one that goes around the windows on the fron doors 
and windshield.  Hopefully this won't take us a significant portion of the 
rest of our lives ;-)
