Subject: Re: $$$$ for OEM Carpet

I bought a premolded one piece carpet for my scirocco from JCWhitney for 
$120.  It was OEM look.

&gt; I got a great one-piece front carpet from Kyle Wade-Volksmotor Sports last
&gt; year that fit and matched in color perfectly.  Check with Kyle, but the
&gt; price then was around $70.

&gt; Talk about Sticker Shock!  When the parts guy at my dealer said I would
&gt; laugh when I saw the price of the front carpet section for my 90 Carat
&gt; from the factory, I knew it would be expensive, but I was prepared.
&gt; BUT, when he stumbled out the $515 price, and to boot &quot;if I can get it&quot;,
&gt; I did in fact LAUGH!  Now, I am wondering about alternatives.  Anybody
&gt; know of any good ones?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
