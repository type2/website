We no longer have much use for a big vehicle like this and would like to find
it a good home with someone who does.

Seats 7 with lots of room left over, good condition inside and out.  FM-AM
cassette, 4 speed manual, 2L water cooled engine.  The engine has 145k miles.
It has been well maintained (myself and Motormania), runs well, and has had
most electrical engine wireing and both aluminum heads replaced within the
last year or two.

Asking $3000 OBO.  Kelly Blue Book is $4500 for one in good condition with
97k miles.
