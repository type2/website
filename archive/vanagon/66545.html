Subject:      VW web sites

I have now translated most of my web site
(http://home.pi_dot_net/~jwbrier/jwbus.htm)
into English. There are some nice pictures of strange buses on my site.

I would appreciate if yopu put a link in your pages. Also I am building my
own link page, so if you have a VW page please send me an email with your
URL. Please include your location and particulars about the site so I can
categorize them.

BTW, I like to build sites that are not only informational but nice to look
at. To view my pages as they are intended you need the &quot;MS Comic sans&quot; font
(i.e. on the W95 Plus disk) and a minimum of 800x600 resolution.
