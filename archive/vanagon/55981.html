&gt;&gt;I don't believe that, in 1986, this is called a Westfalia Weekender.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I was just looking at one the other day and it was called simply a Wolfsberg
&gt;&gt;Westfalia 
&gt;&gt;Camper.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This was supported by Wolfsberg crests on the sides.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Features are same as listed below.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just wanted to add:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;-Poor quality velour fabric interior, doesn't wear for sh#t.
&gt;
&gt;Oh No.... Ok,  Here we go again..........(you asked for it...:&lt;)
&gt;
&gt;The &quot;Westfalia Weekender&quot; is a non-factory term used to coin the:
&gt;
&gt;Wolfsburg Ed. non-GL Westy's  ( &quot;WWW&quot; )
&gt;               AND
&gt;Standard non-GL Westy's.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Keep in mind that in '84 there was a two tone brown Wolfsburg Ed. Westy that
&gt;was a 
&gt;FULLY equipped GL westy, and The weekender term, followed by the Name &quot;Westy&quot;
&gt;is used to differentiate from this model.
&gt;
&gt;Cleared up now?
&gt;(of course not....  :&lt;)
