Subject: CA Emission testing

Todd,

When I moved from CA a couple of years ago, anything '65 and newer had to
be tested.  (That's why my Bajas were always built on '64 and earlier
pans... and it is one of the main reasons that I left CA.)  To be sure,
just call your local DMV and ask for the phone number of the local referee
station and call them.  They will have the correct, current info.

&gt;Can anyone tell me how old a vehicle in California has to be in order to
&gt;be exempt from auto emission testing.  I've been told &quot;20 years old&quot; and
&gt;I've also been told &quot;1966 and newer&quot; are tested.  Does anybody know for
&gt;sure?  Has this changed recently?
