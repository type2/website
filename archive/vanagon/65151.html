Subject: Customs Fee Very High?
Date: Saturday, 6. September 1997 15:25

&gt;The price is as shown:
&gt;
&gt;fender lips (3 kg)    DM 320.00   $ 177.78
&gt;chrome      (3 kg)    DM 220.00   $ 122,22
&gt;Shipping to US per kg DM   5.50   $   3,06
&gt;Paperwork total       DM  45.00   $  25,00
&gt;Customs US total appx.            $ 150.00
&gt;Shipping in US                    $   7.50
&gt;

A customs fee of $150 on a part costing $177? Why is this customs fee so =
high?

What about my experience of importing parts with paying no customs fee
whatsoever?
