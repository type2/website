 &gt; for the erudite there were two different kinds of bubble cars made in 
Germany
 &gt; in the late fifties early sixties [...]
 &gt; PS the first was also made by BMW and was called an Isetta is written up in
 &gt; early BMW books.

I always wanted to get one of these so I could go to bars and pick up women 
with the &quot;I've got a beemer&quot; line, and then see their faces when they realize 
what *kind* of beemer I have...

Or maybe I don't want to do it, but it's an amusing fantasy to twist the minds 
of shallow people.
