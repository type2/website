  &gt;&gt;Good point, Sami. I'm leaning towards a GEX rebuilt long block. At
  &gt;&gt;$300 for heads plus another $300 for pistons/cylinders plus another
  &gt;&gt;$100 for bearings and gaskets I'm most of the way to the cost of the
  &gt;&gt;rebuilt already. Not to mention my depression.......Between Dave
  &gt;&gt;Black, Chris Bridge, Dave Phillips and myself I think we have reached
  &gt;&gt;the critical mass for a new SulkNet VW group!

  As far as I am concerned, GEX is worth the money. I bought my '80 Vanagon with
  a blown engine (Connecting rod had come through the case). Once I tore it
  down, I found that one head had a cracked seat. When I priced the parts out, I
  could buy a GEX engine for about $200 more than the parts alone. I bought it,
  installed it, and it ran almost perfect. One hydraulic lifter refused to pump
  up. GEX FEDEXed me a lifter, and offered to pay for a shop or a VW dealer to
  install it! Once I put in the lifter, it was perfect. Many happy miles
  followed.
