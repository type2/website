Subject:      Bus, vanagon parts in Europe

I looked at Ron Salmons Bus Depot pages today. He seems to carry a mouth
watering supply of parts for just about any type of bus or Westfalia
camper. As owner of a '77 and '81 I could use a few parts he carries and in
fact I will probably order some. However shipping some parts like bumpers
is a bit awkward.

So, I my question is:

Do any of you (European) members of the list know of a similar outfit in
Europe, preferably in middle/northern Europe.
