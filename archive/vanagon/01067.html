Subject: buzzing gearshift


During my recent roadtrip to NC, the gearshift on my '76
bus had the annoying habit of buzzing loudly at highway
speeds.  It only seemed to happen in 4th gear.

Is there a shift linkage bushing kit or something that's
available?  I haven't had the opportunity to take it apart
yet, but was thinking that I could pick up the parts first.
