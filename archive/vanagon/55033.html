Subject: Tires &amp; Pressure '85 Westy

My '85 Westy has tires put on by PO.  They are BF Goodrich P185/75R 14 
89S M&amp;S.  I notice the max tire pressure on the tires say 35 psi.  I have 
noticed in the camper owners manual it has one pressure, in the Bentley 
another and some people on the list recommend still another.  Can anyone 
recommend what I should be using.  The camper is always RTR (ready to 
roll) except for food.  We don't carry too many extras and just 2 adults. 
I have a feeling that we are running on marshmallows.  The local &quot;tire 
store&quot; told us to put 33 psi in each.  Your expert advice appreciated as 
usual.
