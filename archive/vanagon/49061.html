Subject: Re: Columbus Day Mid-Atlantic Camp-out?

Great idea, Steve. 

Going back to Elizabeth Furnace would be fantastic, as it will be
prime fall colors and very beautiful.  However Skyline Drive  will be
literally bumper-to-bumper with leaf peepers, and I'd suggest finding an
alternative route for our caravan. 

Also, re locations, I've had some private conversations with folks
interested in getting together around then in the New Jersey Pine
Barrens, about three hours from my place in DC.

Note on the date: though Federal employees get Columbus day off, many
private employers and most school kids do not, so I would suggest
planning for a Friday nite for early arrivals, Saturday nite the center
point, Sunday night optional.

Lets hear what others think.
