&gt; Anybody out there ever heard of or recieved anything
&gt; from The Bus Stop catalog?
&gt; 
&gt; They are part of Rocky Moutain Motorworks,
&gt;  (that name rings a bell).
&gt; 
&gt; Any way, I have a catalog here that seems reasonably 
&gt; priced, and has some really cool stuff in it.

Hi Matt,
I ordered from them quite a bit recently (brake drums, brake disks, 
several VDO gauges) and up to now I am very satisfied with them. Their 
sales reps were to me always nice and friendly and especially the guy for 
technical support is very knowledgable.
