&gt; AVERAGED 20.76 miles/gallon (thats US gallon and US miles). Wow you guys
&gt; have good gas (92 to 94 octane of all brands). 
&gt; More seriously, I think what made ALL THE DIFFERENCE was the INJECTOR
&gt; CLEANER I used three times allong the trip.

	I have definatley noticed this phenomenon many times.  Those tanks
with the fuel system claener (K44 or is it 44K) just seem to go on and on.
But when I figure in the cost of the additive, $20 or something
ridiculous, my cost per mile skyrockets...
