Subject:      Subaru 2 Vanagon

Well, I have been keeping a list of SubVersives for awhile.  Anyone
who has expressed interest in the Subaru engine into a VW has made my
list.  I haven't gone public with the list becasue of the obvious blackmail
potential!

Anyway, since the conversion isn't in my future for a variety of
reasons, and since I haven't added people during the latest flurry of
Subaru threads, and since I'm writing run-on sentences, I'll stop.

Anyone want the list?
