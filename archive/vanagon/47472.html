Subject: 	Re: '87 Oil pressure NEED HELP!!

Low idle speed and wrong viscosity oil can both cause this problem.  Find out
what oil is being used (should be 20-50 or synthetic equal) and have oil
pressure checked with a gauge.  Typical healthy engine should hold about 10
psi per 100 rpm up to the relief valve setting, (engine warm).

Dennis.
