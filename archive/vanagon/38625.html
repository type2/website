Subject: A new addition to our family

Picked up a Bug for no1 son today...'72 1303S ragtop, totally original, body
in need of minor resto (superficial) and paintwork showing signs of standing
out for years! Drives absolutely beautifully - I didn't know Bugs were ever
quiet and purred...mine farts and rasps and sounds like a traction engine.  I
kindly offered Hal my bug with its smart paintjob...no dice...he's not stupid!

I just hope these bugs decide not to breed in my driveway...and god knows what
sort of hybrid might result if they got to close to the van! 
PS Thanks for replies to my request for advice etc re visting USA this
summer..will reply to all individually...
