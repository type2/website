Subject: Upgrading 86-up headlights: the definative answer! (longish)

Okay,
Let me put an end to this controversey as this is something that I've had a
lot of experince with.

 First, the round headlights on the pre 86's is FAR superior to the
retangulars found on the 86 and up.  I have an '85 and  had an '86 which
burned up last summer, so I got a chance to do direct comparisons.  The
high beams on the '86s are pretty good but the low beams are AWFUL,
boardering on dangerous.  Without question, the worst low beams that I've
ever had the displeasure to use.

The round lights shouldn't be &quot;dim&quot;, as Ron says his are, and if they are
then you have wiring/alternater problems and changing lights will not help
that.  All the stock lights are the same wattage as specified by the DOT at
55/60 watts.

High watt bulbs:
&quot;Dimness&quot; is not the problem here, lousey reflectors which send an unevenly
distributed  light beam are.  And high power bulbs will not cure that
problem.  Everyone I know who has converted to high watt bulbs report
limited increases in see-ability.  Brighter lights just don't compensate
for the poor reflectors (read: cheap) and optics.  They will, however,
burn-up  and melt-down your wiring unless you upgrade that too.  High watt
bulbs are NOT a good alternative.

REAL upgrades

Euro H4

The best upgrade option is to replace the stock lights with European H4
lights.  I've used H4s on my Corrado and GTI and the improvement in the low
beam is stunning.   It is said that they're light output is 100% more than
stock.  Not brighter, but the light emitted is better &quot;used&quot;.   H4s are
MUCH better and, if aimed properly, won't blind oncomming traffic.  These
lights are available in a variety of different wattages all the way up to
100/130 watts.  I run the stock 55/60 so I don't burn out the retinas of
other drivers and so I don't have to replace the wiring with a heavier duty
kind.

Euro H4s are NOT technically street legal (especially with the high watt
bulbs) and are not approved by the DOT.   But no one can really tell the
difference and if you're not blinding other drivers no one really cares.

Round headlights have the advantage of being easy to upgrade.  The round
lights are easy to find and replace, at about $30 a pop.

The rectangulars are antother story.  These lights are NOT a standard size
and, therefore, replacements are not easy to come by.  The light is a VW
only part, and the discounters who import Euro lights can't get them except
through the dealers in Germany.  I researched this last year, and then went
to Germany to by some at a dealer (I really HATED the stock lights!).  Only
$135 each side!!  Not including the bulb!!  At least it did include the
bulb connector.  I opted to not buy the lights which was a wise move since
the Westy burned up a few weeks later :-(    .  I had planned to go back
this year and comb junk yards in Germany for the lights, and I still might
do this (I'm leaving for Europe next week!) even though I no  longer have a
later Van.

Legal Lights

A good legal alternative to the H4 is the  Hella Plus lights and the CIBIE
Bobbie lights (which I have on my '85 Westy).  These also claim a 100%
improvement in light output and  may be as good in most ways as the H4s.
But they're cheaper and are approved by the DOT.  They have better
reflectors and a very even beam pattern compared to stock.   The difference
between these and the H4s is probably not enough to worry about, both are
tons better than stock, and this type is easier to get.  Pep Boys has them
and I'm sure other big FLAPS have them too.

BTW, in Germany I saw 86 and on Vans with large (like 9&quot; or more) round
lights instead of the rectangular lights.  I never did get the story on
this so I don't know if this was a retrofit or an option.

Aux Lights

Hella Auxilliary Low Beam lights:
Hella may have an answer for the beleagured 86 and on crowd.  Hella makes a
&quot;Auxilliary Low Beam&quot; head light which looks like a fog light but is really
an enhanced low beam.  Made to be on all the time (well, when the lights
are supposed to be on!), once again it increases the output 100% over stock
lights, AND you get to keep your stock lights!  That is a lot of light!
This light is street legal and is DOT approved.  Hella's charts show an
amazing improvement in light output.  The only drawback is that they sit on
your bumper and might be considered visual clutter....(right Derek?).  I
think Aux lights look cool so it's a taste thing.

=46og Lights:
Also, regular old Fog lights do wonders for enhancing low beam light.  Fogs
emit a wide flat beam low to the ground about 500' in front of the car.
These are the best &quot;Deer Spotters&quot; as their wide beam goes out nearly 180=B0
from the car and light up  various creatures waiting in the median, or
along the roadside, ready to jump out in front of you.  Once you use fogs,
it's hard to ever drive without them again.

Driving Lights:
=46inally, there are Driving Lights which are the opposite of fogs.  They
emit a narrow beam far (like 5000') in front of the car.  Great on long
flat roads with no one else on them.  But not so good when the road is
twisty and the extra distance is of minimal use. And you have to be VERY
careful to not blind oncomming drivers, which means that you have to be
dilligent about dimming your lights whenever you see another car, you have
to be wide awake.


So, those of you who have made it this far without falling asleep, I'm sure
you're asking &quot;Hey if you're such an expert, what kind of light do YOU
use?&quot;  Okay, this is what I use:

On the '85 Westy:  CIBIE Bobbie round lights with 55/60 watt bulbs.  Hella
550 FF 55 watt fog lights.  Hella 500 round 55 watt Driving lights.  (no
deer is gonna sneak up on me!)

GTI:  Hella H4 round Lo/hi 55/60 lights, Hella 5&quot; round 55W driving lights,
Hella 550 rectangular 55W fog lights.

Corrado:  Aerodynamic Euro Headlights for the  Corrado with H4s and built
in 55w driving lights (bought after hitting a deer in 1991 which I could've
avoided had the lights been good!), stock fog lights.

Good lights are not always cheap, but very few other improvements one can
make to one's Van can save your's or your Van's life in so many situations.


I hope all this helps someone out.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The low beams on my 87 Westfalia are really terrible
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Really?  I had been thinking of replacing the headlights on my '85
&gt;&gt;with the headlights from the '87 parts bus I just bought, because
&gt;&gt;my '85's headlights are so dim.  I had been told that the '86-on
&gt;&gt;headlights are significantly brighter.  Is that correct?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ron Salmon
&gt;
&gt;I think we need to stage a &quot;light-off&quot; and determine which has the poorest
&gt;headlights. I'd rate my 87's lights as POOR and my 88's (supposedly
&gt;identical?) lights as ADEQUATE.  I'd sure like to find an easy upgrade that=
'd
&gt;bring them both to GOOD or GREAT status.
