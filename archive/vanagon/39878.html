Subject: Seals for 86 power steering rack?

I need help with repairs to the power steering rack for my 86 GL.  Any
advice, assistance, or warnings would be appreciated.

My 86 developed a leak in the power steering rack shortly after experiencing
the trauma of backended by a Camaro with an unlicenced driver.  My vanagon
was spun around by the impact, and I suspect that the stress on the front
end damaged the seals, as the reservoir went empty about a week later.  It's
been losing about 2-3 qts of ATF a week now, so its time to get the thing fixed.

[The Camaro was totalled and towed away.  I drove home.  No frame damage -
just body work and a new bumper and taillight.  Insurance for uninsured
motorists is a good thing to have!]  

Does anyone know where I can get replacement seals?  The parts houses in the
Milwaukee area don't carry the seals nor the replacement racks.  The dealers
say they don't replace seals any more, as the labor charges equal the cost
of a remanufactured rack. [$430 rack + $130 labor]

I'm guessing that replacing the seals would be similar to doing the seals on
any other hydraulic ram.  Anything special about disassembly/reassembly?

If the seals aren't available, does anyone know of a source for a new or
rebuilt rack?  A used rack in excellent condition?  Is there a shop that
rebuilds them?

Any help is appreciated.                -Randy  86 GL, 84 Wolfsburg
