&gt;Forget the idea of using two 6-volt batteries in series.  Dodge
&gt;tried it years ago and abandoned the idea as impractical.  The
&gt;problem is, no two batteries are identical, there will always be
&gt;a slight current flow between them unless they are physically
&gt;isolated (knife switch, etc) or you use expensive high-amperage,
&gt;low-loss diodes.  Parallel works fine, although it's best to jack
&gt;up your alternator output to about 15.6vdc vs the normal 13.8 to
&gt;overcome the voltage drop in the battery isolator/splitter. 
&gt;(Which you need because of the problem mentioned above.)  You'll
&gt;also find it convenient to wire certain accessories to one batt,
&gt;keeping the other for engine-starting.  A simple battery cut-off
&gt;switch will allow you to switch from one to the other should you
&gt;need the accessory battery for starting the engine.

I think you've got it back-asswards, Bob.  Series means they are connected only
at one point - one battery's (+) terminal to the other battery's (-) terminal. 
The remaining, unconnected (+) terminal becomes a 12V potential relative to the
unconnected (-) terminal.  The two terminals with 12V between them are connected
to the bus's 12V system and voila', you have a 12V deep cycle battery. 
Parallel, on the other hand, is how you connect batteries when doing a jump
start, (+) to (+) and (-) to (-).  This is also how the (12V) accessory battery
for the 'fridge is connected to the (12V) starter battery, except that there is
an isolation diode or relay between the two batteries to make sure the 'fridge
only pulls power from the accessory battery, leaving the other battery fully
charged to start the car in the morning.  When connecting batteries in parallel,
they MUST be (+) to (+) and (-) to (-) and of the same voltage rating (e.g. 12V
to 12V), unless you want to destroy (with possible explosive force), one or both
batteries.  

Just a side note here, when I had a fuel injected '75 Westy, either the owner's
manual or the Bentley's said not to get or provide a jump start.  The rational
here was that the vehicle providing the jump might be running, so when the dead
vehicle started, there would be two voltage generating systems running in
parallel.  This could result in wild voltage swings that might produce extremes
of voltage that could damage the f.i. brain.  Now as an engineer, I would have
designed against this possibility, but Bosch thought a warning was sufficient. 
The solution is not, of course to never get a jump start, but to get high
quality jumper cables, make good connections, and don't have either car running
when attempting to start the dead car.  This is how I have jump started cars
since I was driving my '66 postal bus in W. Germany in '73, and I have never had
a system failure.  (BTW, my '86 Mustang manual provides the same caution, and it
has been successfully jump started many times).

Best wishes and kind thoughts,
