&gt; 
&gt; Some good news, some bad news.
&gt; 
&gt; Brought home an '86 Weekender GL on Tuesday. It has power steering and an
&gt; auto tranny, making it much easier for my wife to drive. Good news.  That
&gt; leaves no more room for my trust daily driver, a '83.5 Weekender GL. I
&gt; tried to keep 'em both, but along with the '60 Westy and '68 Beetle
&gt; Convertible, no go :-(   Bad News.  So here's the dirt:
&gt; 
&gt; 1983.5 Vanagon Weekender GL - For Sale
&gt; -$3,300 obo
&gt; -116,000 miles
&gt; -looks great, runs great
&gt; -1.9L, new head gaskets and no. 3 cylinder replaced in the Spring of '96
&gt; -4 spd manual tranny, all is fine but it does &quot;buck&quot; very slightly (per
&gt; recent string) when worked very hard, ie an hour or so in start and stop
&gt; traffic, just replaced the clutch slave cylinder.
&gt; -A/C, works great, just charged over Summer of '96
&gt; -new metallic bronze/brown paint (non-vw color done by PO) in February of
&gt; '96, no rust, only body work done is a small spot behind the sliding
door,
&gt; looks like a short pole was swiped. This was BEFORE the paint job.
&gt; -weekender interior with rear cushion installed from an '86 (all seats,
&gt; panels, etc.), folding rear seat/bed, split folding middle seat.
&gt; -kenwood am/fm cassette with kenwood speakers installed behind original
&gt; factory grill covers, could use a new antennae though, I think I tore the
&gt; cable during install and reception isn't great but the stereo sounds
good.
&gt; -receiver type hitch rated at 3500 lbs( welded onto frame, not on the tow
&gt; hooks), I'd like to see someone even TRY and tow that amount!
&gt; -it still has the rear aux. heater and was working until this morning. I
&gt; just discovered the valve is very slowly leaking, but I'm going to try
and
&gt; fix it before the sale.
&gt; 
&gt; This van is very clean and runs great. My wife and I have driven it
&gt; everywhere including &gt; 15 hours in one day with no problems. I've done my
&gt; very best to maintain it (with lots of help from the list!) and it's been
&gt; shown a lot of love. The ONLY reason I'm selling it is because of the
'new'
&gt; '86. My wife is a teacher and has to haul around students frequently,
she's
&gt; simply too small to drive/park the '83 comfortably. I wish I had the
&gt; space/time/$$ to keep it but I don't :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that's it! Now I have to post about repairs needed on the '86, here
&gt; we go again!
