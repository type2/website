Hi all!

I've been lurking for a while.......and now i've got a few queries of my own!

Myself and my better half own a 1979 2.0lt T4 powered panel van and as per usual
with these engines the carbs are crap......the idles up around 1500rpm and there
doesn't seem to be a way of sorting them out so we're gonna replace them!

Preferably a pair of single choke carbs as dual throat ones would simply be
too expensive to run all the time!!!!! And i don't want fuel rejection as 
it's too much grief when things go wrong!!!!!!


Has anyone any recommendations for these superb engines??????

many thanks



Neal
