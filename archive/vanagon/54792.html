Subject: EV misc topics

with regard to various EV questions &amp; answers posted lately:

I have the '95 Camper, stick shift, fuel is around 22 mpg highway, less
than that city.
Power is fine - but the previous comments about the high-torque engine were
right on. You shift a lot at low speed when accelerating, but as you gear
up they stretch out a bit. (Now, I wouldn't *mind* having a VR6 in it, but
the 5 is certainly adequate and shouldn't be used as an excuse *not* to buy
a used one if you can find a good deal.)

As for the &quot;lowering&quot; business, I can't imagine why one would want to lower
it. I'd like to raise the damn thing - anyone know if its possible to get
another 3-4 inches of clearance? How would it affect handling? Is it even
possible with a FWD vehicle?

Mudflaps: VW makes a nice set. Very heavy-duty rubber and you'll pay for it
too.
(I don't remember how much now. I did look around a little bit and found
that even *cheap* mudflaps were relatively expensive items.)
