&gt;    More likely the opposite - The book &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, the contents of which I

   And you're calling me a girlie-man?   ;)

&gt;    I have AC in other vehicles, but seldom use it- It is not for claustrophobes
&gt;    like myself. Besides, if you're driving an air-cooled VW and it is REALLY
&gt; &gt;  hot outside, you need to know - and show some sympathy towards the old 
&gt;    powerplant, right?

I certainly wouldn't install one on anything with a 1600 or less.  If I had to
drive in hot weather regularly, I'd definately own something with AC.

    Like anything else... cold
