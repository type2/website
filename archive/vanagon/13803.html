Subject: WTB: Windows for my '62, Tent

I am looking for any Westy-type tent (only with all poles and mounting hardware please) and at least 3 (maybe 4) pop-out side windows for my '62 bus. I only need the window parts (no hardware). The outside rubber on the windows doesn't matter, but the glass, frame and the rubber between the glass and frame should be good. Also interested in buying RUST FREE front doors and front door window sets (prefer with good rubber-- anyone have a restored bus smacked in the back end that they are parting out?? )

Thanks,
Chris
