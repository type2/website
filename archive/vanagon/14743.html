Subject: Re: '89 Westy Price - Reasonable?? 
Date: Mon, 03 Apr 1995 09:16:36 PDT

&gt; My friend is talking with a dealer in the SF Bay area about a '89 Westy. 
&gt; The van has about 70K miles and is imaculate - Power steering, brakes, 
&gt; Air &lt;needs service - no cooling&gt;, automatic, but otherwise seems a very 
&gt; nice van. They are sticking with a price of $17.1K and are quoting a 
&gt; &quot;Blue Book&quot; of nearly $21.

That's about right. My '89 Westy has 45,000 miles and I've been offered
$20K for it.

&gt; What say you all - They have refused $16K saying they paid more &lt;doubt 
&gt; it, but maybe&gt;.

Depends on how bad those 70,000 miles were... I'd ask if they replaced the
fuel filter, redone the undercoating, and a lot of other rust and road
wear things. Otherwise it's not worth the bluebook.

Check the canvas of the pop-top and also check the rubber gasket around
the pop top. Those suckers go first. :)
