Subject: Re: Aftermarket Electronic Ignition

&gt;I'll give you all a hint, a $35 O2 sensor, the bung to be welded
&gt;to the manifold and a digital voltmeter are all it really takes.
&gt;There is a FAQ about this available from the fwd VW FAQ location
&gt;(which I am not currently sure of the location).  I've personally
&gt;been wondering how HALTECH and Berg can charge highway robbery
&gt;prices for their little LED voltmeters.  In short it goes like
&gt;this, the O2 sensor thread is same as 18mm sparkplug, you can
&gt;get the bung from Parts Place or elsewhere or get a &quot;spark plug
&gt;no fouling&quot; adapter from local parts store designed to keep
&gt;plug OK in an oiling cylinder, the adapter is male thread one
&gt;side, female on the other, grind off the male, drill a hole
&gt;wherever (remember beyond the merger of the exhaust from each
&gt;cylinder bank on a VW or before it if you want to tune each
&gt;bank individually with 2 sensors) drill a hole and weld/braze
&gt;her in.  Buy a generic heated (3 wire) sensor, around $30 even
&gt;if you get a good deal, screw her in, appply 12V to heating leads
&gt;look at the output with said meter, .45V is stoich, lower volts lean,
&gt;higher means rich, two sensors are great for dual carbs.  Whole
&gt;thing even if you buy a voltmeter should be less than $50.  Of course
&gt;if you really must have a little LED display I can probably look
&gt;in some old Radio electronics and find an article about building
&gt;a little in line LED Voltmeter display for under $15.  BTW full
&gt;instructions should be at lap.umd_dot_edu in the vw_archives directory
&gt;under ExhaustAnalyzer, ftp as anonymous login and you should be
&gt;good, if anyone wants I will email you the full instructions if
&gt;you don't have ftp capability.  Oh if you put 2 in close enough
&gt;to the heads you probably don't even need the self heating style,
&gt;you need it only if you are putting them far down line after the
&gt;merger, check local speed shops for the bungs and plugs to replace
&gt;the sensor if you don't want to leave it in, or if you only want
&gt;to buy 1 sensor and tune 2 banks individually.  Thread is hypothetically
&gt;18 x 0.5 mm but don't hold me to that.

If you already have an accuraty volt meter this is fine.
Otherwise add another $250 or so for a quality DVM
