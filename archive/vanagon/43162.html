&gt;Vanagons do have factory installed fuel line clamps installed.  However,
&gt;they are some kind of special clamps.  I had one of these clamps come
&gt;loose and spray a 4 inch wide strip of gas for about a mile down the
&gt;freeway.  Fortunately it did not catch on fire.  I replaced the factory
&gt;clamps with stainless steel hose clamps.  If you have a Vanagon I would
&gt;recommend checking these factory installed clamps to be sure that they are
&gt;tight.

When I replaced the engine in my 87 a while back I bought &amp; used &quot;fuel
injection&quot; hose clamps.  I surmise that they're made for a higher clamping
force required by fuel injection systems.  The do NOT have the little
gear/screw with slots cut into the clamping band.  They have a smooth band
that goes all the way arroungd and overlaps a little at the tightening
mechanism.  The tightening mechanism is a screw attached to one end of the
clamping band and a nut attached to the other end of the clamping band.  As
you turn the screw, it pulls the ends closer together &amp; tightens the band.
 It doesn't have nearly the range of diameters that a traditional hose clamp
has, but I guess it must do a better job clamping.
