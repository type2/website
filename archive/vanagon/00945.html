Subject: fuel inlet pulls out of Solex carb! how to fix?


Gentlefolk,

My girlfriend took George, my recently aquired 1973 campmobile
to Phoenix yesterday only to have a problem with the fuel inlet
pipe on one of the two Solex carbs pull out.  She now has it
epoxyed back in place and will try driving home today

Has anyone else had this problem?  Apparently, I haven't looked
at it yet, the small brass tube that allows connection of the
fuel line hose just pulled right out of the carb housing!  Can
anyone suggest a good way to fix this? Set screw? Glue? New carb?

Thanks,

 -Dyer
