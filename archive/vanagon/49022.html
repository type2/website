&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a 1986 Vanagon GL with AC and automatic trans and a 2.1iter motor.
&gt; &gt; New motor with 10,000 miles on it.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This Vanagon has a problem where after about 20 min or so of 60 to 65 mph
&gt; &gt; driving it will cut out for about 1/2 sec then keep on going with no
&gt; trouble
&gt; &gt; for a while (maybe a minute maybe 10 min.)  and then the motor will cut
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; again. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is very abrupt when it does this. And when the motor restarts again it
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; also very violent. This seems to worse the warmer the engine temp. 
&gt; Although
&gt; &gt; over the course of my commute 1 hr+  it may do this once or twice or not
&gt; at all.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I read on the list about wiring harnesses and such but I am not sure this
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; hte same problem.  When it happens, the tach. drops very quickly, more
&gt; &gt; quickly than I would expect,  so I am not sure if I am losing electrical
&gt; &gt; power to the motor. 
&gt; &gt; I does not backfire when this happens though.  
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; Also does anyone know the normal operating range as depicted by the gauge
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; my van. Do we know what the actual spread in degrees is across the range
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; the gauge. If I sit in traffic for awhile I can see the gauge go almost
&gt; 3/4
&gt; &gt; of the way across the face, but I have not seen it go any furtheer than
&gt; that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have bled the system and there does not seem to be any air in it.

Before you start replacing the computer , try checking your electrical
system again. Try to swap a new ignition coil and eliminate this as a
possible cause. Your described symptoms seems to indicate some
intermittant loss of electrical power or possibly momentary fuel
starvation due to fuel pump problems or clogged filter. 
Also some engines that uses the Hall effect system uses a transistorized
module that goes bad quite often. This also causes the kind of problem
you described including poor starting. The vanagon engine has one
very unique feature. If everything is in good condition, the motor
will kick in almost instantly under most weather conditions. You can
credit German engineering for this. If you have to crank the engine like
some autos , something is wrong somewhere.
