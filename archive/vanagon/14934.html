Subject: Re: 5 cyls, starters

&gt;There seems to have been lots of interest in 5 cylinder Vanagons
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;A Bently manual for the 5 cyl? Whew! I wonder whether that would exist,
&gt;if the 5 cyl Vanagon is only available locally. Will try to check.
&lt;snip&gt;

Hi Wouter, thanks for the reply. Can you tell me what the adapter plate cost 
your Dad, then I can compare with what's here, ie. KEP in California. No 
hurry on this. Don't worry about the manual!! TIA. tim s.
