Fellow bus owners,

Does anyone have an exhaustive list of all suppliers of vw parts, or could
at least contribute to it? I know of three, besides vwoa itself:

Rocky Mountain Motorworks/The Bus Stop (various items)
Kennedy Engineering (conversion kits for engine swaps)
West Coast Metric (rubber seals and some plastic products)

They all have catalogs and 1-800 numbers.

I don't have addresses or phone numbers available right now. I would have to
clean up my desk to find them.:) Will probably have them tomorrow.

Also, I'm in the St.Louis area. Anyone know of &quot;local&quot;
suppliers/middlemen, good mechanics, etc., say, within the Kansas
City/Chicago/Memphis triangle?
