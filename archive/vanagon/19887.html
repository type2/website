All this talk of embarrassing moments and batteries reminds me of the time
we went camping in the Karmann Ghia. Three guys and all the camping gear
we could fit, including firewood in the spare wheel well...Biggest guy over
6'3&quot; in the back of course.

 I &quot;discovered&quot; that the rear wheel wells of the
Ghia are perfect
for storing pots, pans, dirty dishes and also bbq grilles. Our embarrassing
moment came as we set off from the campsite when the grille managed to work
its way loose and contacted
both the positive and negative terminals of the battery in the engine
hatch. Not only were the sparks and sounds  amazing but the grille was
reduced to
molten metal and parts of it were literally &quot;welded&quot; to the inner fender.
A genuine &quot;son et lumiere&quot;.

Oh Dear.

Not a vanagon story but a VW story on the complications of having the
battery in odd places.
