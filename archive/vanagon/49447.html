&lt;&lt; The fellow who works on my van has looked at this problem before
 and said the &quot;shift guides&quot; are worn.  The problem went away, but now is
 back.  Any help would be appreciated. Van has 140K on it. &gt;&gt;
Bill, it has nothing to do with shift guides.Either your clutch slave/master
cyl is leaking, or  your trans. syncro hub 3-4 is cracked. It will jam in
gear or be impossible to shift and then under the right circumstance, cur
eitself for a short while.(could also be cheap brazilian syncros....watch
out.)
