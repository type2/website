all this talk about Idiot Guide: The Next Generation   &lt;i like that title&gt;
for some reason made me think of something and i thought i would share it
with the other inmates:

at least on the vanagons of later years, the front anti-sway bar was 19mm
in diameter, but on the campers, was 22mm. so if you wanted a little stiffer
suspension, to help counteract the sidewinds, (which is why i started digging
for this), you might try to find a rear- or side-wrecked camper and get the
front anti-sway bar off of it.  new, the thing costs $150 from the dealer,
and that does NOT include the little rubber bushings and such.

naturally, in europe, you can get a REAR anti-sway bar. :(  not in the
catalog for us NA folks, though.  i wonder if you could use the old 19mm
(from the front) on the rear? it's not the same shape as the euro-rear-bar,
but ...
