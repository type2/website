If at all possible, DO NOT strip out the camper equiptment! There are
precious few clean, original Westies out there. For you to strip out one,
especially a really clean one such as yours, would be tantamount to rape. I
know that is a rather harsh analogy, but reconsider this grave action before
you tear into it. I've owned two Westies and  just love them !  I'm sure you
could find a decent window van out there, and if you needed to, you could
sell the camper, and buy a nice Vanagon. Please do all of us Westy lovers a
favor, and keep it intact and original!
