To All:

In a recent posting describing the way volumetric balance is achieved, the
message should have read '...this is NOT a trivial task..' with regard to
sinking the valves.

The spacers mentioned are used on the cylinder studs.  They are just pieces
of tubing large enough to fit over a stud, of a suitable length to allow the
reference plate to be torqued down.  The reference plate is any dimensionally
stable slab of metal, drilled to allow the studs passage and having a hole in
the center of each cylinder-space to allow checking deck height.  I use a
plate of precision-cast aluminum but I have seen mild steel and even cast
iron plates used for this purpose.

I apologize for any confusion the omissions may have caused..

-Bob
