&gt; Fellow list members,
&gt; 
&gt; I have the following problem:
&gt; The coolant expansion tank on my 85 GL has a couple hairline cracks by the
&gt; cap that allow coolant to escape under pressure.
&gt; Does anyone have suggestions for repairing this?
&gt; Are replacements expensive?
&gt; Is this a dealer only part?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

I do not remember the cost but they are not expensive and they are not a
dealer only item.
