Subject: Diesel &quot;stumbling&quot;

On my 86 Vanagon diesel(ok its really a Jetta) which I just bought I noticed
recently that it &quot;stumbles&quot;(misses) under acceleration.  Any thoughts from
you diesel folks out there?
P.S.  Thermostat seems to be stuck open, little heat and the needle doesn't
move off cold ( I know the guage does work after taking the car over the
mountains).

Best,

Bill Lund
