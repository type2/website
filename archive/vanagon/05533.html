&gt; &gt;Just out of curiousity, what do you camper owners use 
&gt; &gt;the pop-top for?  Added headroom, or do you actually 
&gt; &gt;sleep up there as well? I can't imagine leaving the 
&gt; &gt;top up when it's 10 below. Do you just have it open 
&gt; &gt;when cooking, etc, and then close it (in the cold &gt; 
&gt; &gt;months) when it's time sleep?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;-Jim,


  The uses of the pop-top are pretty much as you had guessed. The early ones
  (pre-68) were just for head room and ventilation, from 68 to '73 Westfalia 
  pop-tops had a fold-out cot for one and from '74 on there is a bed up there 
  that will fit two. 
  
  Additionally, the window and the screen both zip open giving the easiest 
  access to the luggage rack.
  
  Living in California, I have yet to experience a temperature like the one
  you mentioned. I have used my pop-top on ski-trips where the temperature
  dropped into the teens. My kids are the ones that sleep up there, it's
  their favorite spot, and they don't usually complain about the temperature
  until after they've gotten out of bed (but you should hear them then.....).
  
  What motivates me to close the top when camping is wind more than temperature. 
  A strong wind when the top is up makes a lot of noise and movement.
