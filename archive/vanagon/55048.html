Howdy.....

What are the diffrences between a US and german camper eurovan.

The dealer told me that the german on is shorter but by how much?
Do the fridges work differently?  One propane.

Anyway what do you think of these prices?
1995 EV with 66,ooo km for $30,000 cdn.
1995 EV with 25,000 km for 38,000 cdn
both automatic

These prices seem very high to me.

Please give your opinion!!!!

Thanks
 
Cpt. Chris
