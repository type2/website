Subject: Headliner re/re ??


Anyone any advice on doing this in a vanagon.  The '85 crewcab has zero
insulation/padding between the headliner and tin roof.  It was -11C this AM
and took longer to warm up inside than is reasonable, especially considering
it's half the volume of a regular van.  I need to insulate the roof, but
don't want to destroy the headliner in the process. The edges over the doors
seem clipped/glued. So help me, I am an addict, like you. 
Any thoughts on insulation?  Leaning towards fibreglass house stuff, but a
steady rain of glass fibres has limited appeal. (would vapour seal however,
so...) Styrofoam panels squeeeeack.  Don't like foam-in stuff, too
permanent.  Ideal would be some Westy plywood roof panels with house FG
behind, not likely though :(.  bye, tim
