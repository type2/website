Subject: East Coast Directions

 For this weekend, there is only one campground open at Jordan Lake. It is the
CROSSWINDS campground, LOOP B
Jordan Lake St. Park is located on highway 64, about 15-20 miles outside
Raleigh. Once in the Park, which has rather nebulous boundaries, there will be
a stoplight at a crossroads, with a general store on one corner. IF you are
coming FROM Raleigh, as in 64 WEST, then turn right at the light. If you are
going TOWARDS Raleigh, as in 64 EAST, then turn left at that light. Go about 1
and a half miles down that road, and follow signs to Crosswinds campground,
loop B.
Those brave souls who make it will have a lovely time. Hope to see you there!
(Someone PLEASE bring a camera)
Bring about $20.00 for camping fees. Exact fees depend on how many show up.
Gates open at 8am and close at 6pm
