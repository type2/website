Subject: Westy Pre-Purchase Q's

I have received several requests from list members for my &quot;list of pre-purchase
questions&quot; which I used in my long-distance purchasing process. This was the
first round of questions I had for the dealer, once answered and with info from
the individual who &quot;looked&quot; at it for me, I went back with additional questions

Re:	1991 VW Vanagon GL Camper/Westfalia

Please respond to the following request for information on the Westfalia which
we discussed. I am seriously interested in purchasing this vehicle, but need 
the answers to these questions prior to making a deposit. Although we discussedsome of this information, I would like to have the answers in writing from you 
as assurance to me so that there is no misunderstanding on the details of this

ascertain the information from personal inspection.

Please List any known problems:

The following 2 items are known to be problems with many Vanagons. My '80 had
oil leakage on both the original and the new (replacement) engine and required
a quart of oil every 500+ miles. Both my '80 and my '91 had to have the fuel 
tank dropped and the complete fuel line and fittings assembly replaced to stop
leakage on fillup. I understand that this has been a reoccurring problem with 
Vanagons.

Any sign of oil leakage/where:

Any sign of gas leakage from overflow hoses on fill up:

I have the original glossy sales brochure for the '88 Vanagon. I assume that 
the standard set of amenities listed for the &quot;Camper GL&quot; are the same for the 
'91. If you know this to be incorrect, or it you do not have a copy of this 
information and would like me to FAX you a copy of this list I can do so.

Would it be possible for me to talk with the previous owner on details which you might not have? If so, please send name and phone number so that I may contact the previous owner.

Thank you for your time in responding to my pre-purchase request for 
information.
