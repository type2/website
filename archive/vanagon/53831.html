Subject: Re: Syncro Convention - Again!

&gt;| Oddly enough, their was an REI store that shared a distant portion of this
&gt;| same parking lot.   Another example of that cosmic REI - Syncro connection

	I saw a post on this earlier but didn't say anything then... When
I popped into the Seattle Rei store on, I guess, the Monday day after
christmas, there were at least two other syncros there. A silver one across
the east-west running street and a white one across yale (right in front of
the store). There was also either a vanagon or a syncro with the same
titian red paint job and a rack parked down yale ave by the northern
end of the shop... Anyway, hello to the others of you who were out on
that wet day...
