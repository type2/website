&gt; 
&gt; Front heater blower is making one heck of a racket when on full blast. 
&gt; Sounds like a flock of birds in there trying to get out. Not sure what 
&gt; kind they are! Also started making that nasty burning plastic smell that 
&gt; my wife likes so much. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice before we go bird hunting?

  The blower in Francesca'a MGB makes that noise frequently. In her case, it's
  leaves. The intake is a horizontal, unscreened opening just ahead of the
  windshield and she frequently parks under our tree.    

  Where does the air enter on a vanagon? Is it screened?
