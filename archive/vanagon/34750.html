&gt; When I took
&gt;the trans out to replace the input seal, I noticed the pilot bearing in the

&gt;wobbled around and destroyed the input seal.  I now attribute the poor
clutch
&gt;action to be the input shaft binding up a little in the self destructing
&gt;needle bearing.

I had a pilot bearing on an Audi 100LS that seized so tightly that the clutch
engagement/disengagement was meaningless.  It was siezed so tight that all of
the engine power could be transmitted through it to the transmission
regardless of clutch position.
