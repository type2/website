Subject: Re: Convincing my wife...(famous last words)

&gt;So GRAZUL_at_zodiac.rutgers_dot_edu says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How do you guys/gals do it?  A friend of mine really wants to sell me 
&gt;&gt; a '73 beetle,  it runs,  no rust,  a real beauty....plus two of its 
&gt;&gt; organ donors which can be left in the field where they currently reside.
&gt;&gt; The price?  $750.00 for all three...my wife is quite sceptical.  Is ity
&gt;&gt; jealously?  Could be the staggering price tag....Should I be sneaky?
&gt;&gt; I tried the Xmas thing already....I would love some input...

FAMOUS LAST WORDS:

&quot;Gee Honey, I really didn't think you'd end our marriage over a $750. bus
deal!!&quot;

My dear departed dad used to say, &quot;It's not the cost, but the up keep!&quot;
I suggest that you rent the movies &quot;The Money Pit&quot; and &quot;War of the Roses&quot;
prior to the purchase. =)
