&gt;Tim,
&gt;
&gt;You would be LUCKY to breathe in my flatuence....   ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Ric

        So does this mean that your flatulence is a joy that only the few
privileged can savor, such as expensive wine? Or that your flatulence is
the odor equivalent of Schafer Light beer in a can, making one fortunate to
survive exposure? Enquiring minds want to know...   ;-)

Peace,
