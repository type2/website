&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The last of the real buses were produced in '67.  Everything
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; without a split window is a shameless imitation.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Does that mean my '91 is a &quot;Tart&quot; or &quot;Hussey&quot;  ;)
&gt; &gt;&gt;Steven
&gt; &gt;I got to thinkin....if Steven's is a &quot;Tart&quot;, then my Eurovan is
&gt; &gt;a Slut. Then I realized that the EV would not like being called
&gt; &gt;a Slut. Instead, I took an axe and split its window...now its
&gt; &gt;no longer a shameless imitation.
&gt; 
&gt; well, i guess my vanagon is just a whore with a heart of gold. :)
&gt; 

For the cost of the upkeep these gals require, perhaps more
respectable appelation is in order...
