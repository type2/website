Subject: Re: Embarassing moment: '79 westy on fire

Well I must tell this. 
 One day while driving to work my camper started to smoke, lots.  This did
not alarm me as it had done this before.  I usual would go away after a
while.  And it did.  But then just as I was pulling into the parking lot it
started to smoke again.  When I pulled into a space and got out, took a
moment to look at the back end.  A small gas/oil fire was burning in the hole
of the muffler.   Having not yet bought a fire extinguisher, I calmly walked
into work, pointed to the nearest extiguisher and asked if it worked.  It did
and the bus was saved., will only mild heat damage to a a very rusty and
holely muffler.   Let this be a lesson to you people who need to rebuild you
engine.  Do it now before you bus burns.
