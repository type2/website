&lt;&lt; I installed Bilstein shocks about six months ago and the ride has
 never been better...it was a real and noticable improvement. Now I
 need to replace the rear springs tho....fortunately I found a shop
 that will manufacture them for two hundred a pair...much better than
 the dealer's 319.00 a piece that I thought was going to be the only
 option. The only drawback is that I will have to be without the bus
 for two weeks. Go with the Bilsteins, they are alittle more expensive but
 worth it.

Derek Drew,
This sounds like a potential source for some custom Syncro shocks for your
Syncro suspension project.

Regards,
Jim Davis
