Subject:  re:questions about 79 westy I Mike might buy (longiish) 

Mike: Let me get this straight? You are considering buying a bus  that
     has been _Rolled Over_, by a guy who says it does _80+_ just fine, and
    used a quart of oil a _week_!? Sounds like the bus has been thouroughly
   THRASHED!
  Just one question? Does he know which wheel lifted first;-)
