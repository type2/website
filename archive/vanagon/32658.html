&gt;&gt; Hiya! Going thru the local classifieds this a.m., came across a gas
&gt;&gt; heater for a thing, $200. Anyone know how much chance of adapting this to
&gt;&gt; my bus there is?           

&gt;Put down the paper and back away slowly and no one will get 
&gt;hurt.  I spent many hours trying to bring my gas heater back from the 
&gt;dead.  With all of the sensors and exhaust pipes and the danger of 
&gt;having something burning an explosive fuel sitting in your lap, should 
&gt;be enough to disuade you.  If that isn't enough, you can find a 12V 
&gt;electric heater that is considerably more efficient and safe.  If 
&gt;someone is advertising the heater, it probably doesn't work anyway.  I 
&gt;finally got mine to work and sold it to some slobbering VWphile for his 
&gt;vintage bug.  I know use the space for my stereo amps and tape storage.

Wow, Gary what did gas heaters ever do to you???!!!  My 12v Eberspacher BN4
is very simple to work on and provides great heat.  Care should be taken
anytime you work with gasoline, but I wouldn't dissuade someone from
installing a gas heater in their bus for the same reason I wouldn't dissuade
someone from installing a gasoline engine in their bus.  Reading the service
manual for your model gas heater and verifying that the individual
components are functioning properly takes the mystery (and much of the fear)
out of these heaters (did for me anyway).  It is especially important that
you inspect the heater for such things as rust holes and mouse nests,  fuel
lines in good condition and secure wiring before you attempt to &quot;fire&quot; one
up for the first time. Most of the time diagnosing a problem boils down to
using a volt/ohm meter.  Each time I've had a problem with my heater it has
safely shut itself down and waited for me to troubleshoot (2 occasions, not
major).

Newer versions of these heaters that run on diesel or gasoline are still
being sold (but for outrageous prices, primarily for use on construction
equipment and heavy trucks).  

A good word of advice from listmember Tom Johnson is that the Stewart Warner
model heaters didn't have the safety features that the Eberspachers do and
so they should be avoided.  My only experience has been with the Eberspacher
BN4 and I've been very happy with its performance, especially this winter!!

BTW, 12v electric heaters do not heat!  I learned that the hard way when I
bought my first bus.  Real cold weather (0-30 degrees F) requires a gas
heater or propane furnace.  And if you still don't believe me, I'll sell you
a 12v ceramic element heater (&quot;Back Seat Heat&quot; model) for cheap!

Maybe someone can help the original poster with his question about mounting
the Thing heater in a bus.  I'm wondering if the BN4s that were installed in
the Things differed only in the placement of the mounting bracket and
exhaust/intake pipes location.  If that is the case, perhaps it's just a
matter of cutting the holes for the pipes in the right location on the bus
and finding a way to mount it securely with the proper side up.
