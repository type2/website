Subject: Death by fire?carb leaks

We have carried acouple of these horror stories in the SSVC mag recently. The
problem sems to often lie in the little brass pipe which is supposed to be
tight in the carb, the fuel line attaches to this. Apart from wear and
vibration, removal of the fuel line can also not help! The little bleeder just
loosens...then falls out..petrol goes on engine...BLAM.No bus..
A spot check of 30 vans in a field at a meet last summer revealed TWO with
dodgy little brass pipes (sorry dunno posh name) and potential for OMIGOD!!
I check mine regularly...now! Suggest others have alook?
If anyone can suggest how to stick this lil bleeder eternally in position I'd
be grateful..._dot_can I pass on any ideas in next &quot;Split Screen Scene&quot;?  Dave :)
