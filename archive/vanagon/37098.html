Subject: Tinkling sound

All,

Starting today I started to hear a tinkling sound, this only occurs when
the bus(79 Westy) is leaning to the right(making a left turn).  I first
noticed this sound when driving to work in the 30 mph crosswinds that
were here today.  I also noticed the same sound when retuning from
dinner.  At first it was only at hi-way speeds, but tonight I heard it
at low speeds as well.  I appears to be coming from the front of the
bus, unfortunately I cannot tell if it from the left or right.

Does the collective have any ideas?

Cheers hoping its not serious,

David
