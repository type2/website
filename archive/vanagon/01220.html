&gt; 	thanks for the info. Joel.  I wonder if anyone is ever going
&gt;to try and document all the varieties made out there. Does anyone
&gt;have a Dehler, Devon, or Dormobile ? Confusing, eh ? I was looking
&gt;at the '72 and on Haynes Manual ( purple ) and they have a picture
&gt;of a camper (I think '73) and it is hinged at the front with the 
&gt;luggage rack at front too. I've also seen them hinged at the back
&gt;with the luggage rack at front and also every combination in between.
&gt;What gives ? Is there any kind of order to how Westfalia  or whoever
&gt;did the modifications ? Also, if you got a Campmobile sticker inside
&gt;does that necessarily mean that Westfalia did it or could it be
&gt;Dehler ?  Also in the Haynes Manual they mention that two models
&gt;exist for the '72 thru '79 campers: the Caravette (not Caravelle),
&gt;and the Continental. One sleeps four and the other sleeps two. Mine
&gt;('72)can sleep at least seven or eight. But mine does not hinge at the
&gt;front or back. It pops straight up ! Does anyone else have this ?
&gt;I bet you its a Dehler &lt;*: !!

        My '73 was originally converted to a camper by Devon. In the UK, VW
dealers sold two official camper models; The Continental was built by Westfalia
and the Caravette was built by Devon. There were many other companies converting
and selling campers but these were not available from VW dealers. In fact Devon 
produced a whole range of conversions as well as the Caravette. Mine is(was)
a Week-ender, sort of like a bus but the middle row of seats fold out into a
bed. There's not much of the Devon stuff left now since the interior was in a 
bad way when I got it so most was ripped out and rebuilt with Reimo parts
(Reimo makes a huge range of conversions/parts for european vans including 
the Vanagon and Eurovan. V.nice but v.expensive too) and a Westfalia pop-top.
Dormobile were another British company and made the biggest pop-top you've 
ever seen. It was the full length of the van, tilted sideways, and then 
extended out to the side. Like having a house on the roof :-)
