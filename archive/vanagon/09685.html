&gt;Sami:  So let me see if I understand.  You will install the heater fan as
&gt;soon as it gets warmer.  There's an old story about a leaky roof that needs
&gt;mending.  Only trouble is that when it's raining the roof is too wet to
&gt;fix, and when it's not raining it doesn't leak, so why fix it.  I
&gt;appreciate the irony here.

Don't laugh, my present and previous landlords had the EXACT same attitude!
When the roof was leaking in the last place, in May, his answer was &quot;well,
I didn't expect it to rain in May&quot;  Direct quote!
