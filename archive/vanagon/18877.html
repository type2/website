Subject: Hard Shifting..sometimes

    Since acquiring her, Ramona has always displayed hard shifting from time
to time. Sometimes, she's smooth, and sometimes I can't even downshift from
3rd to 2nd. She just won't go. I've had the trans gear oil
checked/drained/replaced, but that didn't make a difference. My question is
this: when I have the engine out and her guts exposed, how do I check on this
problem? What do I look for? Is it something that I can check before removing
the engine? Any ideas or similar fiascos? Y'know, she doesn't pop out of gear
ever, but this thing with the tuff shifting is getting me all worried.
HELP!!!!!!!sos!!!!!!!
Again, thanks.  Rach
