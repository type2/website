Subject: VW Paint

Hi, 
Been scrapin' and scratchin' around all the surface rust spots today and had
a remarkable revelation. In those spaces where the 2nd paint job just flaked
away to reveal the original coat I discovered that it was DIFFICULT to
scratch that paint with a STAINLESS STEEL TOOTHBRUSH! I couldn't believe it!
Where can I get this paint? My plan was to do a *meticulous* prep job then
have Miracle paint it. Is this a good idea? Can I get my own paint, say from
VW, then have Miracle use that? The original color was that pea-green. With
all due respect to those of you actually like that color it is just not for
me and mine. Leilani (artistic and cosmic Director) had something like a
bright yellow in mind. I htink I read a post that mentioned an orginal
&quot;chrome yellow&quot; does this sound right? 
Anyway, all suggestions greatly appreciated.
