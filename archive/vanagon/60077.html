Subject: Need Syncro Front shocks

 BatSubject:     Need Syncro Front shocks               5/16/97    2:59 PM
Hi, the front A arm bushings on my '89 Syncro are, well they aren't.  I got
bushings from the Parts Place in Michigan for a reasonable price.  I figure if
I'm going to tear the front end down, I should be doing shocks at the same
time.  (vehicle has 147,000 on her, and the shocks are shot)  I won't pay $277
apiece at the dealer.

So who knows of a good source for FRONT SHOCKS for a SYNCRO.

While I'm at it, where can I get either a reasonably priced exhaust connector
pipe. (goes between the 2 crossovers and the Catalylic)

Ch '89 Syncro
