Subject: EEEEK!  Oil light flickering
Date: Thu, 15 Dec 1994 06:26:06 -0800 (PST)

Got off of the freeway, was driving about 65 for around 15 miles.  
Stopped for red light at end of off ramp (Jimmy Carter Blvd. for you 
grits fans) and as the engine starts to idle, the oil LED begins to 
flicker.

I checked the oil, it's level, we aren't overheating.  I continue on my 
way, driving the surface streets to my office.  Never happens again.

BTW, I did just change the oil, for the first time after acquiring the 
beast.  I'm running Mobil 1 5W-30.  What do you think?  Am I looking at 
impending doom here?  Volkswagen used to say, back in the middle '70s 
anyway, that this was normal and I've never believed it.--
