Subject: ultimate transplant-almost

Transplanters et al,

        I live in the Wash.DC area and I frequent the Smithsonian's Air and
Space museum. There in a plexiglas case in the entrance foyer I pass the
ultimate waterpumper vanagon transplant, a watercooled 3.0 liter
fuel-injected horizontally opposed 4 cylinder aluminum engine. A beautiful
piece of engineering that was used to power the Voyager on its nonstop
flight around the world. This thing has always intrigued my vanagon
instincts. So today I finally took the time to price one of these gems. I
called an aircraft engine rebuilder an he brought me back to reality --
$30,000 worth of reality!! Oh well back to the 2.1.
