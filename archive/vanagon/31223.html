&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm envious. When I bring the V6anagon in, they'll probably take one 
look
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at it, and shoot me on sight. And then impound the car.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nah, first they'll impound it, let you suffer tearfully for several
&gt;&gt; minutes,
&gt;&gt; &gt;then shoot you!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Oh, now I feel SO much better.
&gt;
&gt;It's time to move back to Minnesota and register it as an experimental
&gt;vehicle.

No, it isn't.   :^)

I lived in Mpls and Anoka for five years. Marched in the Gopher marching
band for four of them, and once got my lips stuck to my mouthpiece after
a hockey game in January. Enough is enough.


&gt;Hmm. You must have that designation there. Wouldn't this qualify?

Never heard of it, but I'll check. If it exists. it probably carries with it 

some CYA caveat like, &quot;Forbidden for use on a public highway&quot;.
