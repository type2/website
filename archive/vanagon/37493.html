&gt;
&gt;All, this is regarding my 79 Westy,
&gt;
&gt;Last week it got relatively cold(low-mid 20's), and I noticed, along with
the
&gt;usual crappy performance(carb conversion), my gas milage dropped thru the
&gt;floor.  The week before(65 deg and up) I was doing about 18mpg, normal. I
&gt;haven't checked this weeks milage, but looking at the gas gauge, it is at
&gt;1/4 tank, and I have just broken 100 miles.  Also when the temps were cold
&gt;it ran like it had a bad spark plug, but when warm it did not.  Is this
&gt;normal
&gt;or would I be correct in thinking that one or more spark plugs did not
&gt;survive
&gt;the cold snap? Or maybe time for new dist. cap, and rotor?  Wires,
&gt;plugs,points
&gt;were replace before Thanksgiving trip to Disney(for those who remember),
&gt;don't
&gt;know when the dist cap and rotor were last replaced.
&gt;Although it was warmer there was a large improvement in performance, but not
&gt;to the standards of 2 weeks ago and before.
&gt;
&gt;Waiting with breath baited,

A block of ice is forming from humidity in the air and your crappy carburetor
is freezing clogging your venturi and redesigning the effective surfaces
inside your carb.  .  If you must keep your weber centralized single
carburetor, you must find a way to route warm air from under the engine to
the air cleaner.  You must also find a way to keep the intake runners
extremely warm while the engine runs even in the summer.  If the fuel mixture
is allowed to recondense in a cool intake runner, that nifty fiendishly
complicated carburetor is pretty much useless, hunh?
