Subject: distributor


I think I have problems with my distributor. With low rpm the centrifugal 
adjustment (Fliehkraftverstellung) sticks and with higher rpm, 
sometimes it is all fine.

Now, my manual says you cannot disassemble the distributor. But I doubt 
this. Did anybody already disassemble his distributor? Any problems or 
difficulties?

TIA

I also got dozens of messages from ORAPOST. What's wrong there?
