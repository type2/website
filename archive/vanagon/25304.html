&gt; anyone have experience with the &quot;PC 300&quot; model 110v inverter?  They 
&gt; are about 70$ now and was wondering if anyone has used it.
&gt; 
&gt; it is rated for 500watts intermittent and i've heard either 300w or 
&gt; 150w continuous...  seems there's a disparity in the rating.


I have the PC 600 inverter.  It cuts out right at a 5 amp load.  I
wouldn't bet on the PC300 doing more than 300 watts.  It's not a bad
inverter for the price, but I would only count on the continuous rating
at best.  Kinda wish I'd splurged for the 1500 watt model.
