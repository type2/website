Subject: Re: Why adjust valves?

&gt;clearance goes to zero.  Backed the screw all the way out to find 
&gt;that the tip had been mercilessly pounding away in one spot such that 
&gt;the impression of the valve stem (from my old head) had left its deep 
&gt;mark on the tip of the adjusting screw.  

Yuck, I've seen this type of thing before.  Usually the end of the valve
stem has mushroomed or has a nice symmetrical indentation on it which makes
valve adjustment a crap shoot.  The broken push rod end problem I described
was beginning to create such an effect---I just keep handy an assortment of
spare adjusters from engines I've parted out.

&gt;  Now the rocker - valve system is designed to connect off center 
&gt;such that the valve rotates slightly with each tap.  Apparently this 
&gt;didn't happen.
&gt;  I backed out the screw, filed it round, re-installed and adjusted.  
&gt;Ah, quite... Never ran better.........

As a card-carrying-hyper-paranoid-anal-retentive type I must add that I
heard somewhere the surface of the valve adjuster screw is hardened, so
filing it might yield you an adjuster that is more prone to wear.  Now I
don't know if or how long it will take for such wear to evidence itself and
I should add that I've been known to reuse old, non pitted valve adjusters
that have lost some of the curvature they originally had on their face.  My
guess is if you check the adjustment at 3,000 mile intervals anyway, even
the filed surface shouldn't let you down significantly enough to worry about.
