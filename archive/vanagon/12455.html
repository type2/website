Subject: 71 Single Cab for sale [uk]

Ok for the handful of UK people on the list;

On seeing the handful of dead and dying busses in my drive
some guy knocked on my door and asked if I would be interested
in his;

71 Single Cab. In need of alot of rust removal and welding
around the bottom (`In need of restoration', as he put it).

He wants 500 quid. Seems alot, but I said I'd put an ad up
for him anyway.

cheers
