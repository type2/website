Subject: Re: Hitches

I pulled about 1200# (3 sailboats) with my '67 and later with my '74 vans with 
minimum problem. The '67 dropped #3 valve at 62k but that was not when pulling.
The '74 has over 100k and is running fine.

If you are interested, I have the info on the hitch I put on the '74 that worke
very well. Let me know.
