&gt; 
&gt; &gt;We are painting the Westy because it is in excellent shape but has some
&gt; &gt;scratches and faded paint. We would like to return it to its original
&gt; &gt;condition.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you considered just polishing the paint. I used a rubbing compound on
&gt; the old 75 bus and uncovered some beautiful, new-looking, paint beneath
&gt; the oxidized layer. It's a somewhat tedious job by hand, though, but much
&gt; cheaper. 2 people can do it in a day.

I would whole heartily second this opinion.  Never under estimate what a little
elbow grease can do for a paint job.  I had great success with this approach on
my '84 Vanagon I purchased in March of '94.  I have had numerous people ask me
if I had it painted.  When I bought the van it was covered in tree sap. mildew
and several years of oxidized paint.  I used a five step process:

	1) Thorough washing.

	2) Complete wipe down with a bug and tar remover, Turtle Wax makes
	   a good product.

	3) Dupont Polishing Compound.  The Rubbing Compound is quite harsh
	   and should be used with caution.

	4) Mequiars Deep Gloss Polish.  Does not actually add a protective
	   barrier.  Think of it as adding 8 essential vitamins and iron 
	   recommended by 9 out of 10 body shops.

	5) Mequiars Carnauba Wax.  This step is the protectve coat that gives
	   the high shine.

For less than $15 bucks you could buy the products and do a small test spot
to see if your paint is salvageable.
