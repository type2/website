Subject: Also Been To VW Heaven

I too can testify that nice guys do exist. In my search of the VW treasure I
stumbled into an older gentleman that used to have a single cab and sold me
the canvas, hoops, and stays for the '57 single for $80.00!! He didn't &quot;want
to hurt me too hard&quot; (on the price-get your mind out of the gutter). He said
that &quot; a couple years ago&quot; he called the local VW dealer and inquired as to
the replacement cost of the canvas. &quot;Do you know those bastards (sorry) told
me they wanted $150.00 and wanted me to wait while they ordered the thing
from Germany, I told them to forget it!!&quot; He also turned me onto a huge box
of Small World and Foreign Car Digest magazines 1960-65 complete and a set
of NOS typeI seat recliners for $20.00. Recently, he called me and told me
he had &quot;something&quot; for me. It turned out that he GAVE me a mint 1961
dealership calendar from a local dealership that I never knew existed. He
refused any payment and suggested that he would be offended. This is not a
case of taking advantage of a senior VW enthusiast. I have spent time
visiting with him and helping him with his computer stuff. Especially after
dealing with my elderly parents I am quick to spend time and help out in
other ways making sure to avoid taking advantage. A quick note: he used to
work in a dealership that used to wholesale ovals and split ovals into
Mexico [for a song,  I'm sure :( ] whenever the regular customers &quot;upgraded&quot;.
