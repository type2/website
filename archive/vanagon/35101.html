Subject: Bad Gas?.......or just a fact of life?, and what about that fridge?

Question #1
Alright, so there we were drivin down the highway, then I felt what 
seemed like the engine sputtering off then restarting to normal.  It 
happened a couple of times before I could get to a place to check it 
out.  Nothing was obvious when I checked it over.  As a matter of fact 
ir ran a bit smoother at idle after this happed.  We continued the trip 
(approx 250 more miles)  without a reoccurance. Any suggestions?  could 
it be the fuel filter starting to clog?

Question #2
The fridge.  Any recommendations on fixing a tempermental fridge?  It 
worked fine in the driveway at home, but when we went to use it on the 
road it wouldn't light.  Althought I could see it was definitely 
sparking when I hit the ignitor.  There was a smell of propane once in 
awhile after doing the pump and ignitor sequence.   Arghhhhhh!!!


Any help/advise is appreciated.
