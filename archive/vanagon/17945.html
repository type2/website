Subject: Need Help Power windows

My passenger side power window in my 91 Vanagon is broken....
I took off the door covering and found out what the problem is...but dont 
know the 
best way to fix it....

There is a verticle metal bracket upon which the window rides up and down ....
sitting in this bracket is a thin guide wire/cable....at the bottom of the door
the cable makes a 90degree turn with the help of a plastic giude that snaps 
into the verticle metal bracket....however this plastic guid has snapped out 
of its guide.._dot_causing the cable/wire to not sit along the bracket...this 
results in
a stuck window....
Does anyone know how to losen up this cable so I can snap this 90degree 
plastic cuide back into place???

it look llike this:

   ____window glass_________________
