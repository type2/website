&gt;What changed after '63?  Is that when they went to the larger-diameter

i think vw decided to upgrade its requirements for the tires ... since it was
likely becoming evident how much crap people were cramming into those things.
one of those lawyer 'we told you not to do that!' things.

&gt;Any recommendations for reinforced tires for a '61 Panel with 14&quot; and/or
&gt;15&quot; rims?

i would think that any of the tires that are ok for the vanagons would be
fine for the split-windows. perhaps a tad overkill and perhaps more expensive
than absolutely necessary, but still ok.
