&gt; Does anyone have clever and reasonably priced sources for door and window 
&gt; seals for a '71 bus?  Mine are just a tad non-existent.  Also, any clever 
&gt; fixes for floor holes (not really huge) that won't require replacing the 
&gt; floor?

 As far as the door seals go, J.C. Whitney (phone-order parts place)
is probably the cheapest (for new ones). 
 Floor-hole patching is a very easy procedure. You will need the
following tools and supplies: (better yet, go to a U-Fix Garage, with
rented tools)

 - 1 pair &quot;tin-snips&quot; (10-15$)
 - 1 pop-rivet gun (10-15$)
 - rivets (better to get a wide range of sizes; keep the same
diameter, but with different lengths)
 - body repair tin (galvanized; easy-cut)
 - body hammer (5-10$)
 - power drill with coresponding bits for rivet size (they break easily, so
get a few)
 - used oil (from the oil change you just did!) and a cheapo paint brush 

 All of these things can be procured at either a body-repair warehouse
place or at a hardware store. Firstly, cut the tin to fit generously
over the holes (leave a little extra for floor ridges). Next, take
your oil and brush each patch and each hole (generously). Do each hole
one at a time; place the patch where you want it, and drill one hole,
making sure to go into GOOD floor metal. Put the rivet in and squeeze
til' she pops. Put another rivet on the other side of the patch to
secure it, then take the hammer and &quot;beat&quot; the patch into place
(conforming to any ridges, twists, turns, etc.) Then put rivets in
around the edge of the patch about every 2&quot;. Do this for all holes and
you will have a professional job for a back-yard price. 

Cheers,
