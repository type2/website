Subject: My Westy diesel needs an engine..YIPPEEEE!

Well, it finally happened. The '82 Westy diesel that I bought in Florida 
&quot;poofed&quot; its engine. Actually, sounds like a blown head gasket from the 
PO overheating it like mad - but close enough to blown for me!

This gives me the excuse to repower with a gas burner...just the reason I 
bought the van in the first place! Now, I could stuff a V-6 in the back, 
but I am hearing loong tales of woe about that one. (sorry Steve, I feel 
for you, but I just couldn't resist) I am now looking for a Golf 8 valve 
1.8 engine to install.

I figure I will try to find a complete car with the engine still in it 
and running. A rear end smash/total or a Jetta/Golf with a blown tranny 
would keep the price reasonable. I figure on spending $500-$800 for 
the car. With a complete car, I can get all the wiring, and possibly 
install the A/C from it in the Van. Once I am done with it, I'll send it 
to a boneyard.

If anyone knows of a good donor in the Washington, DC area, please let me 
know! Thanks!
