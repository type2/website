&gt; &gt;This trip report reminds me of a question that arose on my recent trip to
&gt; &gt;the Canadian Rockies. Should you follow the same precautions camping in a
&gt; &gt;Westfalia that you follow camping in a tent in bear country? In other
&gt; &gt;words, should you be concerned about a bear ripping through the poptop
&gt; &gt;canvas to get at the food in the van?
&gt; 
&gt; I have been told many times by park rangers that even a metal door won't
&gt; stop a bear if they really want to get in.  I would recommend not keeping
&gt; *any* food in the camper while in bear country.  I often violate this rule
&gt; in practice, but it would be different if I had kids/wife with me.

Around here, I'd be more worried about cougars - saw one last trip 
out near Jordan River - man are they big. The tail alone was about 4' 
long!
