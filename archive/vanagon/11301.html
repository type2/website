&gt;There is a recall on July 86 to Jan 87 on the idle stabilizer, main &gt;control

info. VWofA will replace ALL of the above so &gt;check it out, in FAQ I assume.
 For Syncros and non. My Syncro &gt;was made Feb 87, tim 'no luck' s.

Tell me this is so Joel &quot;Data Bank&quot; Walker.  My syncro was produced in
November 1986, and I wasn't aware of the recall  Do you have any other
information concerning the recall?????  What does campaign PB mean???  

Thanks

Mike
