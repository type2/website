Subject: Help!!!!! Need starter for an '88 Vanagon -- automatic
Date: Sat, 26 Apr 1997 14:44:32 -0700

Hey all!

Got a call from Joel last night to lend some help to a guy named Kevin
who had starting problems in St. George Utah (about 120 mile north on
I15 from Las Vegas) His problem is a stripped drive gear on the starter.
No one in St. George or Las Vegas has one for a 1988 Vanagon
_Automatic_. This is a unique starter for this transmission. He can't
get one ordered and delivered till Wednesday at best. If anyone knows of
a way to get one sooner let me or Joel Walker know and we'll get the
information to Kevin.
