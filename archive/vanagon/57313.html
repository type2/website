Jeff,
When checking the oil, I get my towel/rag in the left hand and hold the
flap down with that hand and then pull the dipstick with the right and
do my thing.

When adding oil, I put the oil cap between the flap and the body, if you
face the inside end of the cap toward the van and make sure that one of
the spring edges rests on the outside end of the cap, the flap will stay
open quite nicely.

When doing timing, etc, where I don't want the oil cap off, I usually
use my socket wrench or a screwdriver handle in the same manner as the
oil cap above.

&gt; Howdy -
&gt; 
&gt; I've been wondering what other people do to hold down their rear 
&gt; license plate door to check the oil?  
&gt; 
&gt; Did VW get better in later years and actually provide some way to 
&gt; hold the door down?
&gt; 
&gt; I use my foot to hold open the door when checking the oil.  
&gt; 
&gt; When adding oil, adjusting timing, etc. I use a piece of wire shaped 
&gt; for the purpose to hook from the underside of the bumber to the top of
&gt; the door.  I store it on top of the hinge, bent slightly to keep it from 
&gt; sliding off.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried wedging the oil cap between the door bottom and bus back, but 
&gt; this is not an option when checking timing, and it didn't hold the 
&gt; door open far enough for my tastes.
