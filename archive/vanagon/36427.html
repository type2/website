&gt;     The mystery bus is RHD?  This could be the clue to the story.  I 
&gt; have a RHD 1966 Westfalia that has the emergency flashers, tail 
&gt; lights,bumpers and other details included only (I think) on North American 
&gt; Westfalias.  It was built some months later than many of its parts.  
&gt; Maybe RHD buses were cobbled together at some far corner of the plant in 
&gt; Hanover as the market required them?  I got my '66 from the original 
&gt; owners here in Christchurch.  They bought it new in Germany and shipped 
&gt; it to Montreal for one year before it came to NZ.  Maybe it needed to 
&gt; have the US DOT equipment in order to be used in Canada?  I've never 
&gt; checked all of the numbers to deepen the mystery of my bus.  I am 
&gt; planning on shipping it back to the States when I move back home in 

Oh do I wish the Pioneer was RHD, but alas it's a LHD.  Your theory 
is superb though.  Maybe my bus body got stuck in the corner for a 
while when someone forgot about it!  ;)
