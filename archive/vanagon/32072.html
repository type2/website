Hope it was really cheap.  If you have to get a new tranny kiss $2000.00 
goodbye.  

Good Luck,

&gt; Hi Vanagon Listers,
&gt; 
&gt; I just ran across a cheap 84 Vanagon with a bent mainshaft (4-speed).  
&gt; All else appears to be fine.  The tranny's partially disassembled and the 
&gt; wasserboxer is still in the van.  Hopefully it won't take too much work 
&gt; to get it back together.  I've yet to get an understandable reason from 
&gt; the PO on why the mainshaft became bent.  Anybody ever run across this 
&gt; problem?
