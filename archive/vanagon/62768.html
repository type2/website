&gt;         Body is in excellent condition
&gt;         silver color
&gt;         grey interior
&gt;         limited service history
&gt;         Needs rear bumper and muffler
&gt;         Just bought it and the female in my life said enough is enough.
&gt;         Something has to go. I have three, need only one
&gt; I have no time to give the TLC a syncro deserves.   I am asking $11,000
&gt; obo. The van is in Knoxville TN.
&gt; Call (9-5est) 1-800-264-6757 and ask for Kenneth.
