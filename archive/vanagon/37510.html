Subject: Westy cushions and Cabbage.

Derek had said in reference to cleaning foam cushions:
&gt;The only way to get the soap/water out of the foam pad inners was to put 
&gt; two giant pieces of plywoods down in the driveway with the foam in between and
&gt;then drive on the plywoods. Squeezes all the water out fast;

this also works for making egg rolls.  

an Oriental restaurant (and no, you won't get the name) would put
heads of cabbage into burlap sacks, lay the sacks on their parking
lot, throw plywood over them, and drive back and forth on top of
this to pulverize the cabbage for egg rolls.  

they were delicious.
