Subject: Mounting Tire (was: Center Console)

FYI,

There's a mounting bracket for this. It's a four-bolt plate with a long
bolt that goes through the tire; then a plate and wing-nut secure the tire.
I think it's generic and about $10 or $15....then there are covers that run
from about $30 to more than an original, chromed emblem. Problem is, you
have to drill holes in the front of your bus to mount a tire up there.
Ouch!

Both are available through many mail-order stores and FLAPS.

BTW, one solution to emblem theft is to keep yours a little rusty. Of
course, this coming from a guy who took his off and stripped paint and rust
(then primered) within days of getting the van.

My dos exes...er, centavos,

&gt;How do you mount the spare tire on the front?  I've seen some busses
&gt;like this and have wanted to mount it in the front to make room for tool
&gt;storage in back as well.  Also, the bus has looked sad ever since some jerk
&gt;stole
&gt;the VW symbol off of the front.  Spare tire on the front would make it
&gt;happy again!  Can anybody help?
