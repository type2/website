&gt; 
&gt; I need info. about a replacement for my 82 vanagon diesel ...I found a good
&gt; deal          on a low mileage engine from an 86 jetta .
&gt; 
&gt; _it looks like it will fit?? the junkyard guy says no problem!!
&gt; 
&gt; -does the 86 jetta engine have more HP than my old 82.
&gt; 
&gt; -do i need to swap over anything other than the oilpan , oil pump pickup tube, 
&gt;  fly wheel and clutch assembly.
&gt; 

exhaust system? you can fab your own, but it is quick and effecive just 
to keep the diesel exh manifold, pipe and muffler.

the '86 gas engine is CIS injected yes? if so you'll probably make new 
fuel distribution lines (depend where you locate the fuel distributor.


good luck
