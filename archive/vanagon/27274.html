Subject: Re: WHICH LANE TO DRIVE IN...

&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand why you would deliberately drive this way.  In
&gt; a steady flow of traffic, you're safest in one of the outer lanes.
&gt; In a slower-moving car, you're safest in the right lane (given the
&gt; choice of right-most or left-most).  I never have understood why
&gt; anyone would choose to drive in the center lane and allow themselves
&gt; to be passed on the right!
&gt; 
&gt; I personally always try to stay right except to pass.  It makes
&gt; sense--although occaisionally some idiot can't find a lane open and
&gt; decides to pass on the right shoulder.
&gt; 
&gt; One time a guy passed me on the left shoulder--not because he was
&gt; being a dick, but because it was raining so hard he couldn't see the
&gt; paint lines, and he didn't realize he wasn't in a lane!  Talk about
&gt; driving too fast for road conditions...

In California, the two right lanes are where the trucks by law must 
drive. Unless you are about to exit the freeway, stay out of those
lanes.

Since most freeways have four to six lanes on each side, here is
the algorithm for a VW bus:

Lanes are numbered from the middle of the freeway, so the fast lane is
always lane 1.

switch (number_of_lanes)
{
  case 7:
    lane_to_drive_in = 5;
    break;

  case 6:
    lane_to_drive_in = 4;
    break;

  case 5:
    lane_to_drive_in = 3;
    break;

  case 4:
    lane_to_drive_in = 2;
    break;

  case 3:
    lane_to_drive_in = 2; /* go ahead and fight with the trucks */
    break;

  case 2:
    lane_to_drive_in = 1; /* it's not a real freeway */
    break;

  case 1:
    lane_to_drive_in = 1; /* it's not a freeway at all */
    break;

}
