Subject: Re: Tires and Handling.

J. A. McEachern asks how a tread-depth gauge would be used to set tire
pressures.  

This works, but it is real, Joel Walker, &quot;I know my uphill mileage and
my downhill mileage for the past year&quot; type stuff.  I started, but I
don't have the discipline.  You're going to take nine tread depth
measurements on each of four tires every fill-up, or maybe every 500
miles.  You can cheat and take three measurements or six measurements on
each tire, but you might as well do it right.  What you are looking for
is differences in rate of change of tread depth over time.  If the
center of the tread wears faster, the pressure is too high.  If the
inside and outside of the tread wear faster, the pressure is too low.
If the inside wears faster than the outside, or vice versa, your camber
is off.  If tread depth changes aren't consistent, your tires are 
probably out of balance or front suspension/bearings loose.

Obviously great info to have, if you can stick to it.  The nine measure-
ments you take are center of tread and each edge of tread, at four, eight,
and twelve oclock points on each tire.  The tire wears slowest when it
wears evenly, so the more boringly unchanging your tread-depth measure-
ments are, the better (but also harder to motivate to get out in the 
rain with the gas station bozo wondering what racing team you think your
bus is on).  Extra compulsive behavior points for measuring at air valve,
and 120o away in both directions (rather than random 4,8,12 positions)
and for consistently measuring in the same spot in the tread pattern.

Real racers use pyrometers and judge by tread temperature.  Using rate
of change in tread depth allows you to ignore ambient temp, time of day,
current vehicle load, miles travelled, but means you get your decision
info over weeks and months rather than minutes.

Joel, please note I pick on you out of admiration and wonder, not to be
snide.
