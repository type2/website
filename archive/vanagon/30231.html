Subject: Heat exchanger wierdness, repost


	Folks, sorry if this is a duplicate- I didn't see
the original come back on digest mode and I'd like a little advice:
Little Martha, my '70 single cab, came with heat exchangers modified 
for three-bolt flanges rather than slip fittings. But there were no arms
on the flapper valves- someone tore them off.
	So following the Bentley instructions, we pried off
the cover over the left side (FIF) flapper and saw that the flap
pivot was retained by 'C' shaped metal bands which were pinched shut.
Using a screwdriver, I pried open the 'C' and freed the flapper.

	The heat exchangers I bought for $25 each at a local dismantler
both had intact arms on the flaps. When we pried the cover off the left
side one, we could see seamless tubes, not 'C' shaped bands, holding
the flap pivots. My brother, clever man that he is, suggested I could
hack-saw the tubes to produce something I could then pry appart.
The saw notched the side of the arm, but nothing serious. A few minutes
saw work and I pried the now 'C' shaped pivot holder open and removed it.
unlike the ones in Little Martha's most recent heat exchanger, the one
I'd just liberated had two brass bands around the pivot to serve as bearings.
Inspection showed the old flaps had grooves from being sawn free of
their retainers at some point in the past!

	Soon the new left-side flap was nestled down in its &quot;C&quot; shaped
retainter, and I was gently pinching the retainer shut with my vice
grips. So far, so good, AND I've got something to pass on. And on
top of that, the faces of the flap are hung on with a cotter pin, so
a good flap mechanism can have new-old sealing surface put on should
one desire.

	The old right side flap came out without problem, and when it
did I could see that the DPO or DPPO or whomever had installed these
had actually installed them wrong-way-around- the remains of the arm
that is supposed to operate the flap were on the wrong side (outside)
of both heat exchangers. The left was on the right side, the right
was on the left. I guess it doesn't matter when it can't be operated
anyway, but the idea....

	When I finished prying and sawing on the new-old right side
exchanger, I was in for a surprise. Although the flapper was in good
shape, the arm *was on the wrong side!&quot; From my carefully purchased
left and right side heat exchangers, I'd gotten two left side
flappers! I'd had to saw both of the new ones, so they were as-built
by the factory.... I guess I just hacksawed some rare piece of trivia!
Closer look at that heat exchanger showed that it lacked the operating
lever pivot that the other new-old exchanger and both that came with
Little Martha had....

	So here's my question: the left side, which is intact, has the
operating arm 180 degrees from the flapper itself. The right side,
whee I don't have an intact unit for example, has to fit around the
starter. the wrong-side flapper I do have has its arm  not at 180
degrees. What angle should the arm be?

	Cheer!
	Bill
