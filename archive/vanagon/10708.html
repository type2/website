So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Steve Johnson phoned and asked that I post a message to Gerry and the list
&gt; that his system has been down today - just in case anyone is getting
&gt; bounced messages....
&gt; 
&gt; /martha
&gt; 

Thanks Martha!

I'm now back in business it seems.  Due to a flooded computer room,
we were sent home on an unexpected holiday!  Oh darn! ;)  Anyway,
I was actually able to read all the posts this afternoon at three,
but could not post replies other than the goof that I did earlier.
How was I to know the system I was on didn't have any memory space
yet?  

Well, I spent this unexpected holiday trying to spiff up the alloy
wheels.  Man! They are not very forgiving if you let them go for
a while.  I tried all kinds of potions to remove the offending 
grime (hardened brake dust).  I've resorted to TR3 resin glaze
but it takes alot of elbow grease, but at least that means it's
not too distructive (I hope).  Anyway, the wheels are starting
to look shiny and new again.  

Also, I've been resetting my wiper blades so that they are biased
the opposite way to they want to be at the end of their stroke
and it really works well in stopping the chattering.  Thanks to
those that helped with this.  Kudos go to the porschephiles group
for that specific idea.

Cheers!

Steven
