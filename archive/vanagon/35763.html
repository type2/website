&gt;Heard of a VW I'd like to drag home for resurrection, it's been stored for
&gt;several

&gt;Camper isn't up to towing (that I'm aware of). Any advice welcomed!
&gt;
&gt;

What model.  Trailer is best. If Beetle, tow bar will work well.  Water
cooled Vanagon will tow it flat without much trouble.
