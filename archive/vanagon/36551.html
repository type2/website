Sounds like your coolant system needs recharging.  First,
top off your system with carbonated, malt-based, &quot;coolant&quot; (comes
in easy-to-use 12-ounce containers, at least 4 or 5 are necessary for
a thorough fill-up), then, at regular intervals, drain off excess using
the convenient valve supplied for this purpose.  Works like a charm,
you won't be bothered at all by silly, useless messages, uh, like
this one.     :-)

Is it Friday yet?
