&gt; 1) How long does the engine last, or better phrased, how much shorter is
&gt; the life expectancy than in a Rabbit?

I replace the engine on my '82 diesel Westfalia in April '94. It had
85,000 miles on it and the only faults were a very slight oil leak at the
head gasket and the oil pump press. relief valve was stuck (producing
excessive oil press. when engine cold). Botht of these faults could have
been repaired for about $250-400, but as I had always planned on putting
in a gas engine I did that instead.
 &gt; 
&gt; 2) After the 5 minute acceleration lead-up, at what speed can the Diesel
&gt; Vanagon cruise comfortably on level highway?

On ramps were the worst, especially if it had any uphill grade at all. On
level ground I had no trouble maintaining 60mph, but I usually stuck to
55. I made one big road trip with the diesel, from Victoria to the
Kootenays and back. This required the crossing of 3 mountain ranges
(Coastal, Monashee, Selkirk), and the loaded van went over all, albeit in
second gear on some stretches. Had no overheating problems and was getting
about 406 miles to the tank (30 mpg? Imperial).
You adopted a different driving attitude, more relaxed and aware of the
topography. I begain to look at hills the seame way as I do on my bike :)


&gt; Any feedback about pros and cons particular to Diesel Westfalias would be
&gt; appreciated.

Apart from the engine, they are little different from other 82/83
vanagons. Well, except the heating compared to the aircooled vanagon,
where the diesel is much better.

I think they may be the best bargain in Vanagondom, (good name for a van
bra). Most everyone thinks they are daft, everyone meaning the average
driver exposed to the auto industry's hype. If you can find one in good
condition, even if the engine is blown, buy it. You can always drop ina
gas engine.
