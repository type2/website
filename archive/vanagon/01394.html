&gt;        ps. All Canadian busses came with the Aux. gas heater (designed by 
&gt;Werner von Braun, I believe), except Vanagon H2O, which gets an additional 
&gt;H2O heater under the rear seat, toasty warm at any temp! I don't know about 
&gt;CDN Westi's and gas heaters, anyone?
&gt;
I don't know a lot about the gas heater, but my Canadian Westy has one.  In
cool weather, I set the thermostat for the heater, and everything is very
comfy.  If the extra heat is not needed, the heater fan just keeps running
to help push the warm air to the front as quickly as possible.  Works great.
If only there were heat outlets for the back seat so the kids weren't five
degrees colder than the driver.
