Subject:      EuroAmerican RV Product Prices (Delta Six)

Just a point... Delta Six Industries is the company selling to dealers and
such. The retail company is Euro-American RV Products.

Anyway, here are the prices on stuff I bought a few days ago:

Fluorescent lamp (that over the closet area)    $29.25
Skylight seal     $23.80
Stove flue cap    $6.50

ELEC/WATER ports on drivers' side under window (hookups):

Electrical port  $21.00
City water (hose port)  $19.00
TANK WATER (locked)  $29.00  (this is because the door is new and not
interchangeable with the others.  It locks on the OUTSIDE of the door.   I'm
going to call a VW dealer here (not that raping bastard from yesterdays posts)
and ask what their prices are.  I'll post if they're shocking (as I'm sure they
 will be!).
