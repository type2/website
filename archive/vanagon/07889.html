&gt;I would be interested in hearing what was involved in installing the 
&gt;vanagon seats.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, mine is green/yellow plaid, and I love it.  Very 1976.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

Let's see, this was several years back and I'm working from memory here...

Remove the old seats, turn them upside down, and identify the four allen 
screws which attach the runners to the driver's seat and the swivel to the 
passenger's. 

Make careful measurements about the position of these screws and runners -- 
what you're going to do is mount then to the new seats.  

Now look at the bottom of the Vanagon seats.  They have a completely different 
bolt pattern and runner assembly.  I don't recall of the screws are the same
thread.  
Remove the mounts from the new seats.  If all goes well you will discard these 
along with your old seats.  Remove the rails and swivel from the old seats
as well, 
keeping track of which way is forward/left/right/up/down. 

You need to match the bolt pattern of the old rails to the new seats.  It
doesn't 
match, so you'll have to make some new holes and tap them.  I think I got three 
of the four to be in some real metal (not just sheet metal) so the seats are
fairly 
secure.  Tap the new holes, install the rails, and off you go.  The really
critical 
part is the the driver's side rails must be positioned exactly, in order to
fit the 
rails welded to the top of the wheel well.  

I don't recall that there were any real pitfalls, and the job took about 4
hours.  
I'll look at the seats next time I get a chance, and see if anything else
falls out 
of my rattled memory.  Good luck.
