Subject: clara got hit but is OK?

Just got a call from Claralw and last night at 7pm she was turning into her
driveway in Olympia Wa and someone ran into the side of her 61 bus. She woke
up in the road, having been thrown out. There are no seatbelts in a 61. She
was taken to hospital and after X-rays &amp; MRI scans was released. She I guess
is thankful that she ws not driving the 55 barndoor, but is obviously shaken
up, 

Wish her well and hope the bruises fix quickly and nothing else is wrong.
