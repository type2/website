Hey Erik,
  Do you have a non-VW-appreciating spouse or SO to make your torment 
complete?  Those little &quot;I told you so&quot; looks can really give the dagger 
of frustration a good twist.  I guess friends can do just about as good.
  This list gives me daily doses of motivation and hope when I am 
especially dejected.  A Bob Hoover adventure followed by one of Thom's 
barndoor updates does wonders for my knuckle-scraped enthusiasm.  There 
always seems to be someone else with a beloved bus in much worse shape 
than my own.  They help me keep my perspective when the CV joints have me on 
the verge of a grease-covered hari-kari.  It's a good community.
   When all else fails, take a week off. Just be careful it doesn't turn 
into a couple of months as it has in my case.

Greg

p.s.)  How many friendly waves do you get from other Audi drivers?  
       Probably about as many as I get from other Chevy drivers. Zero.
