Subject: f/  '65 Bus Coolant Hoses

To All:

I decided to replace the coolant hoses on my 1965 bus before making the run
to Big Sur this weekend.  

Left Hose: 89 cents

Right Hose: 89 cents

Total:  $1.88

Had I purchased the hoses from Volkswagen, they would have cost a total of $3
!

Now if I can just figure out how to keep water out of my cooling system...
:-)
