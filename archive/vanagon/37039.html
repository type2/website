&gt; &gt; &gt;As far as shooting someone that enters your yard to tow your car, if you
&gt; &gt; &gt;can prove that they posed a threat to your life( which I doubt you could),
&gt; &gt; &gt;then you'd be justified, otherwise you'd be in jail.

&gt; &gt; Not between dusk and dawn in Texas.  State law provides for using deadly
&gt; &gt; force to protect PROPERTY, at night, if the perpetrators are caught in the
&gt; &gt; act.  And the new right-to-carry law took effect recently.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You caught someone messing with your stuff?
&gt; &gt; Is it night-time?
&gt; &gt; Kill them.

Sounds to me more like Texas will probably end up being a more &quot;polite&quot; 
society if more people get the message that being a bozo burglar could 
cost you more than just a slap on the wrist from the justice system.
