Subject: re: 65 Bus Won't Start

A couple of postings have passed through the list dealing with fuel related
problems on 70s vintage loafs/westys.  So, thought I ought to share my
experience with same on 72 Westy.  Albeit this has different engine, the
problem may be the same.  For a long time, my 72 would crap out after
heating up on a commute.  It acted like my slipping distributer had rotated
out of timing, so I would open the hatch &amp; advance it a tad.  After this,
the bus would start and carry me and the carpool home, usually.  My not too
tolerant passengers told me that I needed a better solution, so off to a
local (non-VW mechanic) for diagnosis.  After 3 weeks, I finally took it to
a good VW dune buggy builder.  They immediately called it as a worn
mechanical fuel pump actuator.  The rod that actuates the fuel pump wears
the sleeve in the engine case to out-of-round, then sticks in the extended
position and won't return.  From that point on I ran an electric fuel pump,
and had many miles of faultless operation.  Meanwhile, I bought the 81
Westy (with tax breaks against my wifes business, hehe) to keep the carpool
happy.

By the way, this (lemon yellow) 81 is the subject of the posting &quot;81
Westfalia Blues&quot;.  It was promised back to me Monday with engine #8
installed.  I should get it finally tonight.  My buddy, who used to race V
class (?) and hauled his veedub behind his loaf has taken an interest and
will go with me to inspect.  Expecting great things from this engine!
