&gt; Volks,
&gt; Is the &quot;Sierra&quot; brand an acceptable substitute for VW dealer coolant for 
&gt; use in a wasserboxer?. I will have to drive 50 miles and pay $15/gal for 
&gt; VW coolant. The local VW shop sells Sierra rather than VW coolant due to 
&gt; the cost they say. Tell me volks, what to do. Also, what of the pink 
&gt; Toyota phosphate-free coolant? Is this more acceptable? I heard from one 
&gt; source that Sierra does not have that good of an anti-corrosion package 
&gt; and this is the last thing I want, even though it is phosphate-free. Any 
&gt; and all feedback appreciated.

Call Jill Jasek, at Sierra: 800-288-7234.  She's anwered all of my
questions to my satisfaction about Sierra and its properties. I use it in
my '84 Westy, including  the flush product and the hydrometer (?) used to
test, and to date, after about about six months, I've had no evidence of
any deterioration. If you are still concerned about rust and corrosion
inhibition,  ask her for a source for comparative data and information,
which I assume she has available.
