&gt;Has everyone else noticed that in the EV your choice is pretty much 
&gt;limited to ONE or the OTHER.  If the front A/C is one the rear heat won't 
&gt;come on.  My biggest pet pieve so far though is that the defroster won't 
&gt;run without the compressor on.  Why does VW think you need to run the 
&gt;compressor to blow heat onto the windshield?

I can offer some insight as to why this is... defrosting simply works better
when heated air is pushed past an operating air conditioning system.  This
is something I miss in my '85 Vanagon since it does not have an integrated
heating and cooling system.  My '92 Passat had the option of running the AC
and the heat at the same time, regardless of where you directed the air, it
kept the car free of significant inside cabin humidity.  If the setting was
directed toward the windshield and side windows, the windows cleared within
seconds when operating the AC compressor--minutes when operating the heat
without the compressor.  Most new cars either have this as an option or a
capability now--my '85 Jetta automatically turned on the compressor with the
defrost/defog setting.  When the system gives you no choice about whether to
run the compressor or not it has the side effect of making sure that you run
the AC compressor regularly.  With the Jetta, I drove almost 150,000 miles
with no compressor leaks; I attribute this to regular use of the compressor
even during the winter months.  By the way, VW compressors will not run
below 41 degrees F, there is some kind of a switch that prevents this--I
assume there is possible compressor or other system damage to be done when
running the system at ambient temperatures below freezing so VW cuts it off
early.
