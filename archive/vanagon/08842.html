Jim,

I went down this road with my 85.  If your bleeding the whole system
thru the bleeder screw on the radiator you need to elevate the front
of the vehicle.  When adding anti-freeze, add it at the resevoir tank
not the overflow and then put some in the overflow.  If it's the head
gasket you will continue to get air in the system and will be
bleeding it every couple weeks.  If the head is bad enough you should
get small drops of anti-freeze coming out at the gasket.  I had the
gasket replaced twice (left bank) and finally had the head replaced
(VW covered all parts).  I didn't stop having problems until the head
was replaced, the new gaskets had no effect, because VW had problems
with these heads.  If you aren't losing coolant thru the heads you
could have a small leak anywhere along the 20' of hoses.  Small leaks
will continue to drain off just enough fluid to start the temp light
flashing.  You just need to keep adding fluid until you find the
leak and fix it.  I've noticed that as soon as cold weather hits my
85 seems to spring new leaks.  Finding them has become an annual
event.  If you have a bad head, you might want to contact VW and see
if they'll spring for some of the cost.

Good Luck,

Ted
