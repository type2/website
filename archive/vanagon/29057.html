Subject: Techron Saved My Tush (Was:Bus Bummed By Bad Gas)

Anybody out there run Techron regularly through their Digifant or Digijet FI?
It saved my butt this weekend.

Da Dust Bucket (my month-old '89 Syncro) had been running great all weekend in
Panamint and Death Valley, up and down knarly jeep roads, over 7000' passes
and across 30-mile stretches of washboard.  *Then* I got a 3/4 fillup from the
concessionaire's gas pumps at Death Valley Ranch (aka Scotty's Castle).

Within a half mile the engine began to miss intermittently, and with a
violent, oscillating lurch each time (the famous Vanagon bucking-bronco
effect.)  I immediately suspected contaminated gas, and cursed the fact that
the tank was now topped off and I had no room to dilute it.  In between
misses, however, I had great, full power.  It seemed like the missing was not
so bad at full throttle, but got worse when I backed off a little and
dramatically bad when the engine was decellerating under load.

The missing continued, getting intermittently worse, until we got to Beatty
NV, where the best thing I could think to do was add a container of STP gas
treatment and top it off with premium from the least-scuzzy-looking gas
station in town (actually, a respectable looking Arco mini-mart.)

No difference in performance.  It did seem that the effect was lessened when
the engine was cold, but came back within a few minutes of driving. (Did I
mention that, just to add to the hair-pull factor, the coolant blinker was
lighting up intermittently for no good reason at all during this episode?) I
had to cross two 6000'+ passes to get to Bishop, where I repeated the STP
treatment, this time with half a tank of Arco again. Again, no difference.  In
fact, it seemed even worse, and when the missing got so consistent it seemed
like I was losing power I pulled over off of 395 to listen more carefully to
the idle.  At that point the engine died, and wouldn't start again.  ARGHH!!
9 o'clock at night by the side of the road in East Bumf*ck, and the Sierras
between me and home.  I kept thinking: &quot;Hey, I could have had this same fun
time with my '77 and saved the nine thousand bucks!&quot; I'm *sure* you know the
feeling :-P.  

Finally, on the umpteenth try, the engine started and held an idle after I
goosed it for a minute or two at 2000 rpm.  We lurched over Tioga Pass, and
down to the Merced River, where I bivvied for the night.  In the morning I
pulled into the town of Merced and with the tank 3/4 down again, the first
station I saw was a Chevron.  

The only gas treatment they had on the shelf was Techron, at $11 for the large
bottle (the Syncro tank is 18 gal.) I told the attendant my sob story, and he
said &quot;Yup, that's the stuff you want, and no, it won't explode when it mixes
with the remains of the STP&quot;, (sorry Bradley!) so I poured it in, filled the
rest of the tank with Regular, and headed down the highway with my fingers
crossed.

The difference was instantaneous and dramatic.  Whereas before I couldn't inch
down the street in 2nd gear without the missing and violent lurching, the van
now cruised smoothly.  I had a few minor misses in the next few miles, and
from then on it ran like a top the rest of the way back into Santa Cruz.

Wow - I'm really sold. I never thought I'd feel actual *gratitude* towards an
oil company, but man, if they could bottle that stuff...oh yeah, they already
do, at eleven bucks a pop.  Well, I feel only slightly less grateful; it was
$11 well spent.  Anybody else use this stuff?
