Funny you should mention ergonomics.  In 3500 miles on the road with  a 
couple of over 8 hour days, I never had one twinge of pain or discomfort 
in my back.  I've never driven a vehicle for that long that I could say 
that about -- GMs, Pontiacs, International Pickup, Other VWs, BMW 325,
Mind you we were sleeping in a tent for many of those 8 days on the road, 
too.  I was just amazed at the end of the trip.
