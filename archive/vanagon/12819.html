I have built 2 motors from scratch. One for a bug, one for a bus.
The bug: 1776, Engle 110, stock size heads (dual springs), and I used
	Dual kadrons. It ran well. I later changed the carbs to dual
	42 DCNF Berg modified ($) webers. It ran better, but I think
	the heads were limiting it from really moving. Anyway, it was
	loud and had good top end.

The Bus: 88x69 using Thick wall clynders, case and heads get bored to 90.5
	Engle 100 cam, stock sized heads hemi-cut dual springs. I used the
	above kadrons on it. I did everything I could for durability...
	dual thrust cam bearings, modified rod bearings to improve oil flow.
	dual relief case, counter-weighted crank...etc. Anyway, this combo
	is great! It is a strong puller and has been VERY reliable. I have
	driven it nearly everyday for 9 years. I took it across country in
	a 65 bus. It is the most drivable engine I've had. Using a stock
	dog-house cooler, it does not overheat. With a single quite muffler
	it is alot quieter than the bug motor. It blows the doors off a 
	Honda accord...that does not say much I know...

I do not subscribe to this mailing anymore so it you want to talk more 
send e-mail to jim_at_tridsys_dot_com. 

PS. I bought all my parts from Berg, except the Kadrons.

Hope my ramblings help

Jim
