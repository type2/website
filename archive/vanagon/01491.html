Subject: Trouble shooting


Hello

        I have been in the process of putting (or attempting to put) the FI
system back on my 76 engine, which is still in my 70 bus.  I think I found
the problem.  
        As previously mentioned as soon as the ignition is turned on the injectors
open and stay open.  Obvoiusly this would cause  a few problems when I try 
to turn the engine on.  I took the system off and completly checked every wire 
for continuity to the proper places and they are all good.  My second step was 
to see if the injectors are grounding some where other than the brain box.  
I did a continuity test from the plug on the harness to ground, for
both sides, no continiuity.  I turn the ignition on and put a light
bulb tester on place of the injector and the light turns on. So 
I remove the ECU (brain box) and the light goes out.  I reconnect the ECU and the light
comes back on.  THis tells me that the ECU is the source of the ground

I would conclude that the ECU is bad.  However When I went to Cleveland
to get the motor in march I saw Bill turn the motor on with this ECU.  All
I did was rebuild the motor.  Mabey the ECU got damaged in the trip ??? :(

        I also thought mabey it was a bad sensor input to the ECU.  I don't 
have the specs for testing the sensors but I can not see any time, or 
condition where the ECU would keep the injectors open all the time.  

        From this am I correct in concluding that the ECU want bad since 
I took it of in CLeveland ?? or am I missing something ??

How about the US soccer team making it to the second round
        Happy happy joy joy

        Thanks
        Brent
