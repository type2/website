&gt;We're new to the list, so please forgive if this, or something similar,
&gt;has been discussed recently.  Not being the in-house mechanic myself,

&gt;thought I might see if someone here could give some assistance.

&gt;We have a 1971 bus.  Last week it made a screeching noise in the rear 

Just a guess here, but my '71 made similar sounds and it turned out to be the
CV joints, you'll know if this is it because it gets worse...Buy an  &quot;Idiot's
Guide&quot; by John Muir at your local bookstore and dive in...it's not too hard a
job to do....or an alternate source is to look up articles by Bob Hoover, his
sermons are available at Richard Kurts home page and I'll bet there might be
one on this subject.. maybe someone can post the exact address for you or use
a search engine, it's called the Old Bus Page.......PINK&gt;
