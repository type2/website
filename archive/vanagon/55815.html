Subject: cylinder head temp sensor

'80 FI aircooled CA Vanagon

I've had quite a few problems with engine shut downs after short driving
distances.
I've posted a few times and got some real helpful info from you all. 8')
For the most part it is fixed but occasionally it will 'burp' without the
engine shutdown.

Findings:
1) frayed alternator indicator light wire. 2) frayed contact on starter
solenoid. 3)  o2 sensor dead. 4) cylinder head temp sensor dead. 5)
ignition coil replaced due to not meeting resistance specs. with ohm meter.
6) airflow boot between meter and air distributer was cracked and created
vaccum leak when it warmed up.
So I am really impressed that it ran at all after finding so many problems.
Well anyway on to the question

So here is the question,  I want to alter the signal from the cylinder head
temp sensor so the computer would recieve a slightly cooler reading. Would
a variable resistor work?   Are there any specs. available regarding
voltage readings?

Thanks, Rudy B. Santa Rosa, CA
