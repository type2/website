Yes, this happened to me.  I replaced the crankshaft and water pump pulleys
with VW Rabbit items.  I used the largest single-belt cast iron pulley I
could find, along with the smallest water pump pulley.  No further
problems, and it runs cooler on steep climbs.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; I sheared off my crankshaft pulley last weekend on my 82 Diesel Westy.
&gt; The center portion of the 2 belt pulley remained bolted to the
&gt; crankshaft flange, but the rest of the pulley broke, in a circular
&gt; fashion around the portion that stayed bolted on the flange. This seems
&gt; ridiculously odd to me. I have had difficulty finding one as this pulley
&gt; is specifically for the Diesel Vanagon only. VW says that only 3 of
&gt; these exist in the US in thier distribution system. I am concerned that
&gt; I should consider having something beefier than stock spun on a lathe.
&gt; The VW parts guy said this is not a high failure item, but that
&gt; obviously the Diesel engine pulses much harder than the gas and that
&gt; apparently the stress causes fractures that eventually leads to failure.
&gt; I guess if a new one lasts me another 15 years I'll be okay. Any
&gt; comments from any Dieselees? Has this happened to anyone else.
