&gt;Thanks again! We kinda of suspeted a converter problem. It started to rattle
&gt;a few weeks ago. I guess we'll need to replace it. Are there any aftermarket
&gt;converters or are we at the mercy of VW. By the way we forgot to include the
&gt;new brakes,and curing the fuel smell,and the new rear hatch supports,along
&gt;with the weather strippng on our list of things we've done.

Yes, Walker makes a repalcement that fits perfectly.  Slightly smaller
element but te flanges are a perfect match and te O2 sensor is in the right
place.  No stupid universal fits nothing right flanges to leak.  I will get
you the number tomorrow.
