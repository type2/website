Subject: New oil data
Date: 16 Oct 92 20:36:56 GMT

I just recieved this data from our local oil distributor.  It is
the update on the new Mobil 1 formulation and that for the new
Castrol Syntec.  They did not have the numbers for the new
Valvoline synthetics yet.  The data on the new Mobil 1 is pretty
impressive.  Based on these numbers, price, and availiability,
there is little need to look further for a synthetic oil.

The Syntec seems to be compromised by it's wide viscosity range.
Notice that the pour point is for all practical purposes, no
better than the Mobil 1 15W-50.  (actually, it's not as good) 
While, meeting the viscosity parmeters, the wide range is 
probably for marketing purposes.  The Mobil 1 15W-50 will pump at
-35 degrees F, which is as good as some conventinal 5W-30 oils.

Any of the ester based synthetics (AMSOIL, Mobil 1, and Syntec),
will give you the benefits that Castrol is making a big deal of in
their advertising.  The ability to cling to metal walls is due to
the polar nature of the ester base stock, not something unique to
Castrol's formulation.
