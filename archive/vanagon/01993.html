 Hi,

&gt; OK, everyone who's interested, e-mail me your list of preferences,
&gt; like what time of year, how soon, for how long, etc., and like

 Well, I'll be coming up through Mexico to LA sometime around March '95 as
part of my &quot;world tour&quot;. I won't have a bus with me (too expensive to fly it
out from the UK, and too much hassle to drive up from Chile :-( ) but
my girlfriend &amp; I could make our way to somewhere in the South around then
if it'll be happening. After that we're moving on to Hawaii and New Zealand.

 I'll probably have a hard job getting email after the end of August, though.

 Even if the vanagon.list trip doesn't work out we'd be happy to accept any
offers of accomodation :-). We're both about 30 and thoroughly housetrained!

Cheers,
        W (Will hack UNIX &amp; VWs for food).
