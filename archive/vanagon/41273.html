Subject: Re:  cruising speed


&gt;This is interesting...I have an 87 syncro w/83k miles.  I like to drive
&gt;under the green (4k) on the tach, pushing 80mph.  Tail-winds help out,
&gt;though!!
&gt;Does anyone have overdrive on their Vanagon (I've heard of using a Porsche
&gt;5 speed)?  It'd be neat to hear what RPM you have at this speed in fifth.

 At 75 I spin just under 4500 rpm, at 70 I'm at about 4100 rpm.  I am
running a stock GL syncro with 215 R75 14 BF Goodrich T/A radials.
The green zone on the tach fades out at 4500rpm the rev limiter is set at
about 5200.  Top speed is about 85mph.  Don't like to run it there for long,
just had to know.

Colin.
