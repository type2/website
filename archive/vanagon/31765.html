Subject: Parting out '59 and '63 Single Cab Pick-ups

I am parting out two single cabs, located in north Texas.
One is a '59 with no bumpers, taillights, or gates. The other is 
a '63 with no rear glass. I also have some parts in Colorado.
All of the parts are good, used, German parts, fairly priced.
If interested, please E-mail or call Brian or Josh at (303)
868-8313, 333-3249.
Thanks in advance,
Brian
