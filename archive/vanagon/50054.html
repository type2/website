Subject: Westy safety

The Volvo/Vanagon story is interesting - I guess it pays to not have the
front end loaded down by an engine! So much for my nice safe Volvo if a
Vanagon can trash it!

Consumer Reports tests on the '93 EV indicated that the passenger was
fairly likely to sustain head injury, the driver was only moderately likely
to have one. This in their 35 mph crash test. Wear seatbelts, and hope I
guess.

I would think that mass/momentum would have to enter into a real-life
accident though. If my 5500 lb EV runs into a 2000 lb car, I'm pretty sure
they're going to be sustaining a lot more impact damage than me.
Also the fact that these vehicles sit so much higher would help too.

Just don't run into one of those expensive SUVs so popular!

(Which reminds me - I saw a &quot;couple&quot; in a Land Cruiser getting their tire
changed by a tow truck driver a couple of weeks ago. Sheesh! I wonder if they
ever even get the leather interior dirty?) People like that just drive up the
price of otherwise fine vehicles which they have no use for!
