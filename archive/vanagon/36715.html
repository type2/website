&gt;I was not pleased with the end result and the paint job had many flaws so

&gt;body shop tells me I should just sand and sand and use putty to fill any
&gt;imperfections.

The results of sandblasting are dependent on the media and pressure.  At the
&quot;Sandblasting Store&quot; where I got my media, they have little pieces of metal
that show you what different media do to it.  

Sounds like I know what I'm talking about, eh?
