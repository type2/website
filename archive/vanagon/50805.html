Subject: Re: PROPEX Furnaces: Group Purchase?

&gt;Why this model in particular? How does it compare to models offered by -
&gt;say - Camping World?
&gt;
&gt;$600 seems extremely pricey. Or am I way off base?

nope, but unit is low demand and very compact, it sounds great.  But check
camping world.  Up here the EV/Winnie furnace is a Subruban-12, 12,000
btu/hr forced air unit, about $730CDN, reported to be avail in USA nearer
$350US.  Suburban sell 16K-btu and 22K models which are the same size case.
They also have buried units with ducting.  My preference would be local
sourced heater. In fact my Coleman Paralytic heater was $30 at a nearby yard
sale, vented via an open window. :)  tim
