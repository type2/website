Subject: Re: QMI test

&gt;Now to the VW thing.  Since then, I've always put QMI in my engine oil
&gt;in all of the vehicles I've owned (and sold). Now I have an 82 Westy and
&gt;QMI swims in its oil. I have no oil temp gage to actually see how QMI
&gt;works in this air-cooled engine. Q: Is anybody out there willing to
&gt;put QMI to the test and share the results with us? Just get a reading on
&gt;your oil gage for normal and hard engine work, and THEN change your oil
&gt;and add QMI and compare the readings. I'd really appreciate your posting.

I know this doesn't answer your request but for what it's worth I live in
victoria, BC and have three VW's all with QMI in them for the past 4-5
years.  '83 GTI, QMI in at 115,000 miles, now 140,000
'91 Passat, in at 1,500 klms, now 60,000
'85 Westy, in at 70,000 klms, now 110,000
'88 jetta Carat, in at 20,000 kms, totalled at 89,000 kms

Never an oil-related problem on any of the cars, no leaks at all and never
have to add oil between changes.

from numerous trips to California, oil temp in the Passat reads between
110-120 degrees Celcius on highway trips fluctuating on load such as going
over a pass.  We drive the car hard and at a good rate of speed on these
trips with air conditioning on and high outside temp.
