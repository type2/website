I'd be interested in the results of your cause, although I'm unclear
exactly where these cup holder would sit in a vanagon - circa '85...

Thanks,
Ivan

&gt; Oooooooooo, luv to have that.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, I'm looking for the small accessory cup/change/small stuff
&gt; holder that VW offered for the Vanagons.  It mounted on top of the dash
&gt; and was made in black (other colors?) high-impact plastic.  I believe it
&gt; came with double-sticky tape on the bottom to hold it to the dash or
&gt; could be optionally secured with tiny sheet-metal screws (I'd hate to
&gt; drill the dash, wouldn't you?).  Don't want it for just myself, but would
&gt; like to find a nice *MINT* one to use as a pattern to repro from.  Have a
&gt; friend who's into plastics (The Graduate?) and could easily vacu-form or
&gt; whatever to make them.  I've had a lot of customers in the past few years
&gt; looking for this.  Anyone wanna donate for the cause?
&gt;
&gt; Oh well, I justa keep ona dreamin'    :-)

&gt; &gt;My Bus's DPO built a wooden shelf which runs from the instrument pod's
&gt; &gt;right side all the way across to the right side of the dashboard. Its
&gt; &gt;back rests on the dashboard (just in front of the defroster vents),
&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt;its front has hinges that are attached to the front edge of the
&gt; &gt;dashboard.
&gt; &gt;It is hinged so that one can get to the ashtray.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The shelf has a raised border, so things laying on top can't roll out.
&gt; &gt;And
&gt; &gt;it has six holes of various sizes for cans, bottles, coffee cups,
&gt; &gt;drink
&gt; &gt;containers, and hairbrushes. Also two tiny holes for pens.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It is unpainted and stained with coffee but is tremendously useful.
&gt; &gt;Adds a bit of rustic charm to the interior.
