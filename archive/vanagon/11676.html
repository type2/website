Subject: Clicking Noise in Wheels - What is was :-(

For all the suggestions (and those that gave them) - thanks. Finally 
found what was making the noise that I asked about. Answer was CV joints. 
Had to have 3 replaced. Found out today that VW recommends that they be 
checked and old grease taken out and replaced (repacked) about every 40K 
miles. 
I don't think mine had ever been done, so at around 90K they gave out. 
Wish I had known about this requirement earlier - it could have saved me 
a bunch of $$.
Thanks again to everyone that lended me a hand and made a suggestion. 
Take care - Jack
