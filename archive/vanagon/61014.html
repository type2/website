Subject: Instrument Cluster Question

I have an instrument cluster problem that has plagued me since I put the gas
engine in my diesel vanagon a year ago.  To get closer to solving it I have
come up with two things I don't know.
1. Would someone with a diesel vanagon tell me what the room temp resistance
   of their temperature sensor is. 
2. Would some elctronic type out there tell me what red red black white means
   on a resistor. (It measures about 20 Ohms).

Thanks
