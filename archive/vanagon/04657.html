Hello,

My name is Lee Ann (borrowing my boyfriends E-Mail account).
SHHHHHHHHH.

I'm new to E-Mail so please be gentle.

I have just bought a 1969 Campingmobile, at least thats what the guy I 
bought it from called it.
&gt;From what I understand it is the year before the Westfalia came out.
  
My boyfriend and I are planning a cross country trip in December.
We live in Vermont and will head south to Key West up through Louisiana, 
Texas, The Grand Canyon, over to Los Angeles, San Francisco and up to 
Vancouver. We don't have any time table so we can take our time.

I'm assuming that a lot of the readers of this net have done long trips 
in their buses and can offer some sound advise as to what to take along.
as far as provisions, tools, clothes, food, pots &amp; pans dishes etc.

We are also planning to buy an Eagle Pass to National Parks. Has anyone 
done this?  Is it worth it, or is it best to just play it by ear?
We are also going to do most of our cooking on a camp stove.

Also what should I expect to pay for a sink/cooler unit, used from a 
wrecked van?
Another questsion is about bras.  Our bus has one and it seem that rust 
has been forming under it.  Any thoughts?
Thanking you in advance,

Lee Ann &amp; Sean
 Very Happy Bus Owners
