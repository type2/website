&gt; 
&gt; Excuse me, but piece of shit????  Most of the major changes to the
&gt; VW vans...or VWs in general which made them difficult to work
&gt; on or less reilable (ie: wasserboxers) were the result of US
&gt; mandated emission controls, safety equipment, etc. One could
&gt; also say some of the changes were mandated by the market place...
&gt; because of increased competition from Toyota, Nissan, hell even
&gt; the US manufacturers...
&gt; 
&gt; The beetle was taken off the US and eventually the European market
&gt; not because VW didn't want to sell it....but because the competition
&gt; was able to do, what the average driver wanted, better. The same
&gt; applies to the vans...the average driver just wants an appliance
&gt; like that piece of shit Caravan.

Well spoken....
