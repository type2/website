Subject: Re: More wear index
Date: Tue, 29 Nov 94 14:11:12 EST

Just looking over these figures there seems to be an inverse relation
between engine wear and known engine-life length. In other words, we all know
diesels have a capacity for long engine life... aircooled vanagons on the
other hand have been known to last less than 100,000 before
overhaul....and Porsche engines?  I am wondering if there are intangibles
built into each engine type that the wear index does not encompass or
alternatively the VW engineers had anticipated knowing that for example
Diesels would take more punishment and therefore made them extra strong...DC
