&gt; &gt; The red switch would trigger the creation of a hostile environment for
&gt; &gt; Mr. Thief:  Electrical shocks, loud sirens, red pepper and dye sprayed
&gt; One problem with the pepper (although I must say that I sure do like the
&gt; idea) is that you would not be able to drive into Canada.  The border check
&gt; specifically asks for pepper spray.

Well, I suppose you could substitute a dual-spray &quot;thief-cleaning&quot; &quot;solution&quot;
by having one spray bottle filled with an ammonia-based cleaner, and
the other with a chlorine-based one.  The switch would trigger spraying
from both sources.

For those who wish for a more passive attack, you could just install one
of those disposable cameras to take mug shot of the &quot;alleged&quot; perp.
