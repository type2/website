Subject: Fair prices?

Hi all, I have a list of Vanagons that are for sale. Since I'm looking for
a Vanagon (preferably a Synchro) I need some advice on the price. Here's
the list:

1.- 1986 Vanagon GL Recently rebuilt engine, imported from U.S.A., Automatic,
    A/C, good solid body, nice interiors. Price $5,800

2.- 1987 Vanagon Synchro, good interiors, Central A/C, a minor dent on the
    sliding door, engine sounds good but has some hesitation, previous owner
    fixed the rust but you can notice the &quot;bondo work&quot; on the van. Price -&gt;
    $5,900

3.- 1982 Vanagon Westfalia, body looks good, fair interiors, all the hardware
    works, NO ENGINE. Price $3,000

4.- 1983 Vanagon Diesel, body looks great, nice interiors, everything is ori-
    ginal, engine recently rebuilt. Price $2,700

I will appreciate your help. Best regards,
