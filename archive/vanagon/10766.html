Subject: Re: is this thing on?


 Um, I would guess that anyone wondering is this list is down, or
has ever gone down just assume it hasn't.

Even when it was horked, I have always received something every single day.
The listserv works like a champ, so its probably your mail link 
or something???

Ok, I'll shutup now :)
