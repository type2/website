Subject: Help me get my front seats apart!
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 1995 20:25:55 -0600 (CST)

Hi all!  I got my big load of interior stuff from RMMW today
and started to work on putting in new seat cushions for the
front bucket seats of my '79 bus.  Can anyone tell me how to
take the seat apart (it's out of the bus already) and get the
vinyl off of the back and the seat without ripping it.  I'd 
like to put the same vinyl back on the seat.  Thanks.

Ken - '79 bus and '79 Westy
