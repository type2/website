&gt;My question is simple - Is it possible (and appropriate) to hook up an 
&gt;external oil cooler while keeping the stock one installed?
&gt; My recent rebuild (4500 miles) seems to be working out well - oil temps 
&gt;here at 2000 ft altitude generally ranged from 180-200 degrees, but now 
&gt;as outside air temps have gone around 80 - my oil temps can rise as high 
&gt;as 230 pulling up some of these hills. From what I've read in the 
&gt;archives this is not at all uncomnmon - and people speak of 250 
&gt;regularly, but that seems too hot to me. I'd been told as far as remote 
&gt;coolers go (I'm interested in the 'plate' style, rather than tube and fin)
&gt;that it's either the remote or the stock. Is that so?
&gt;
&gt;

A second cooler can be used without trouble if done correctly.  I strongly
recomend a thermostat.  Especialy if van is to be used in cool weather.
