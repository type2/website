Subject: Towing split window bus w/ '82 Vanagon

Can this be done? My Chevy (no flames please) truck needs a new transmission
so I would like to use my '82 Vanagon as a tow vehicle to retrieve a split
window van that I purchased. It about a 1000 mile trip, and I do not want to
do anything too foolish.
Thanks,
Josh
