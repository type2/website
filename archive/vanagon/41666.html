Subject: 1980 Vanagon camper for sale

My Vanagon camper is for sale. I've sold off the tent separately, and
knocked down the price somewhat as a result. New tires, gauges, brakes
etc. extra pair of wheels too.
Ready for the summer camping season, and since it has a furnace you
can even use it now and next winter!

You'll find a full description and lots of photos at
