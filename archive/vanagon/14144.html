Subject:       Re: 65 transaxle - help!

&gt; Some part of my drive train (on my 65 Deluxe) is faily load as I cruise
&gt; down the highway.  I suspect it's the transmission and not the reduction
&gt; gears.  When I coast (i.e., put in the clutch) noise reaches the normal
&gt; level that I'm use to.  Aren't the reduction gears still rotating?  I 
&gt; haven't check out the manuals - but I pretty sure the trans. is indicating
&gt; a major problem is coming in the near future.  Its a loud whine/growl-
&gt; worst in 4th and under a load (going up an incline).  What trans. can be
&gt; interchanged? 60-67? 

Sounds like you might just be low on tranny oil.  Have you had that 
checked.

&gt; Should I switch from swing axle to post '67 IRSs?

Is that possible?

&gt; Can I pull the transaxle w/o removing engine?  Anybody?  Thanx in advance.
&gt; At least the weather's improving.

Nope.
