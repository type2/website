Hi there,

I'll have to sign off next Wednesday since I'm starting on my
three month (hopefully) PostThesisDefense trip. And there is
still no news on the Baja trip! 
Can you organizers, David, Steve, give me an off-line contact,
so I can find out around mid-October what will actually be
going on and where and when? Jens.
