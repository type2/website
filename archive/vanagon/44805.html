Subject: slight change  :)


Well, as a few of you have reminded me, some of our more avid CCC
crazies won't be able to attend anything on the weekend of July 26th,
since they'll be off to Inuvik.  A few others have indicated that
this a busy weekend anyway, and on top of it, our list-leader,
Gerry Skerbitz will be near that bay area that weeknd.  

I'm going to therefore propose tha we plan for a party/picnic type
if thing for everyone to meet Gerry, probably in the vicinity of
Sacramento, and have asked Gerry to suggest some possible times/
locations.

As far as camping goes, how about the following wekend, which is
the first weekend in August?  It isn't the best for me, but I
may be able to work around it, depending on the location.  The
Inuvik people will of course still be gone, but maybe we can
have fun anyway  :)

Lemme know...
