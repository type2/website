Subject: flickering oil light

Got a bit of a shock last night: after a spirited jaunt down the hwy,
I arrived at my destination, just as I stopped, I noticed the oil light was 
flickering every so slightly.  If I gave it a tiny bit of gas, it went
out.  I bumped up the idle by about 1/2 turn of the scre, and the
problem went away (it seemed to be idling too low)

The engine was pretty warm; it didn't seem to be overheating, but it
was working.

Should I be alarmed at all by this incident?  

I was thinking of enrichening the mixture a tad (does the screw go in
or out?) whaddaya think?  Fan belt is tight, everything else is in
order, or appears to be.

BTW - it was &gt;100 degrees or so.
