Subject: Re: Starting From Engine Bay

hmm...i have a similar setup, bu without the jumper, so i have to turn 
the ignotion on....but i installed it because back when my EX-generator 
started going kaphut, there wasnt enough voltage geting to the front then 
to the back to kerchunk the solinoid..my switch is simple...a bare wire..:')
of course, taped over so as not to gorund out, just incase that would do 
anything...:)

as for the jumper.....well, lets not go there..today has been as real bad 
day with my ignition systemm...:(

&lt;read the post i will eventually make onthe t2 list to hear all about it...&gt;

oh...i always make sure its out of gear before i go back to start it..:)
it makes it easy to gdo compression test alone..or, when tuning the carb, 
and it kaphuts on ya, just tap the wire, and keep 'er running...but, i 
leave it just on the switch to be sure i dont accidently drive it away..:)

anyway....david

&gt; &gt; I recently hard wired in a remote start switch to my engine bay.  
&gt; &gt; Along with that I added a hot wire lead from the starter main lead.
&gt; &gt; There were lots of warnings about NOT using the terminal 15 coil lead 
&gt; &gt; for supplying power for timing lights, etc with the Hall distribution 
&gt; &gt; system, so I needed another hot source.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Disadvantage is that none of the dash warning lights function as 
&gt; &gt; power is supplied by another piece of the ignition switch.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had forgotten to post this until reading about Craig's dead '74.  
&gt; &gt; Modifying wiring like mine would allow Craig to diagnose dash 
&gt; &gt; separate from engine wiring. (Clara, are you lurking?)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any downsides to this I missed

&gt;     This is DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!   I have seen people do this, with just
&gt;     temperary switchs.  After an hour or so of playing with something,
&gt;     and driving the car around a bit,  they forget that they left the 
&gt;     car in gear, and try to start the thing. Most of the time they 
&gt;     get lucky and It don't start.
&gt; 
&gt;     After seeing a dragster demolish 3 homes, I said I would
&gt;     never use one.!!!
