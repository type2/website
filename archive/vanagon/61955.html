Ted:
Your starter bushing is worn out!!I believe it resides in the
transmission case.The starter binds up because the pinion shaft is not
being held properly. Cheap and easy to replace; if you have the right
tool. 
Good Luck

&gt;I'm having the strangest problem with starting, and am out of ideas. 
I've had 
&gt;the starter rebuilt, replaced the battery to starter cable, tried two 
&gt;different fully charged batteries, checked the connections at the
battery and 
&gt;the starter, and the wires at the top of the fuses.  
&gt;With a fully charged battery (13+ volts) the starter spins, but if the
car 
&gt;doesn't immediately fire the starter won't keep turning the engine get
 it started, as if there isn't enough capacity in the battery to keep it 
&gt;turning.  You can still hear it trying, kind of a chuga chuga, but not
fully 
&gt;turning the engine over.  At this point the battery voltage is down to 
&gt;12.4-12.5.  The battery terminals are very warm, as is the starter,
although 
&gt;the solenoid is cold.  
&gt;If anyone has any ideas or other things to look for I'd be very 
&gt;appreciative.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
