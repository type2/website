Subject: RE: Cooler Seat for the Eurovan MV Weekender package
Date: Mon, 10 Apr 95 13:36:38 EDT

For Christian (7039ckrah_at_umbsky.cc.umb_dot_edu):

You're probably asking the wrong person to get technical answers but I'll try to 
respond as best I can.

I have a '93 Eurovan, with the Weekender package. One of the 'luxuries' that came 
with it was a rear-facing seat behind the driver. It has flat floor supports and mounts 
with four bolts into the floor of the van.

The cavity of the seat, below where one sits, has a cooler just about the size to hold a 
12-pack of cans plus a whee bit more. The cooler is wired to run from a 12-volt battery.

I took the seat out since I needed the empty room more than a passenger placeholder.

I have stored the seat since then in a protected environment.

I'm certain that I will never use that seat and I'd gladly like to turn it over to someone 
who can put it go good use.

As for price ...

	I have no idea of the real value of the unit 

but I can imagine the value is somewhere in the $1,000 range.

I will consider reasonable offers from there. Good folks, like the &quot;gentlemen&quot; from 
Alabama and Massasschusetts could be facilitators and/or arbitors about price, value 
and peace-keeping among the Vanagon family. :)

Let me know of your interests.
