Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome

&gt;I am sure you folks with the later VW buses don't have this problem, but
&gt;recently I've taken on the chore of restoring the interior chrome in my bus.
&gt;I've tried several methods and have had varying success, can anyone offer
&gt;the best solution? snipo

didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond' suggest
using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly toxic (it is for
this reason that you don't compost them)
