Regarding the differing opinions about tools and which should
you buy.  In my experience, I've haven't had much trouble at
all with the cheaper ones.  And I've used them quite a bit
on my '68 and '74 vehicles with no problem whatsoever.  I
don't remember where I got these tools, but I know I didn't
pay too much for them.  Now if you're cranking and twisting
bolts and nuts day in and day out, then fine, get the more 
expensive set.  However, the original poster did say that he
has financially restricted.  What will you tell him if he
buys all of these expensive tools and reconsiders that he
doesn't want to do this mechanical work anymore?  Of course,
it's up to the original poster to make this decision, but
I don't think at this point in time, that it is imperitive
to buy the more expensive tools.  Especially if you can't
afford them.

Flame off.

Asbestos suit on.
