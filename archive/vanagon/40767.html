Subject: Rust preventing: undercoating?


the blue painted undercoating that was on my van is wearing off in places. 
 This is especially visible on the rear suspension swing arm.  The 
undercoating has worn off and the paint underneath is also being abraided 
away, leaving exposed metal and surface rust is starting.  Has anybody done 
undercoating work or had it done for them to prevent further corrosion?  If 
you have, could you pass on any tips or suggestions?

Thanks,
