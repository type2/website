&gt;While changing the plugs on my 86 Syncro I noticed that the fuel injector
was
&gt;just kinda hanging in the port. What actually holds the injector in place?
&gt; There seems to be a couple of o-rings and some sort of gasket. Are they
&gt;replaceable  , or do I need to get a complete injector assembly?

Those little rubber rings on the injectors are held down by a little metal
clamp piece and screw that holds each pair of injecotrs.  It doesn't seem
like much to keep a fuel injector in place, but it seems to work.  I'm not
sure, but I would guess that the rubber rings would be available at a dealer.
