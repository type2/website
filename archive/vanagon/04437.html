Subject: rolling haiku

I've been noticing cars that are like rolling haiku -- a whole short story
in one car.  For instance:

Spotless black 85 Cadillac Fleetwood.  Red mudflaps on all four wheels.
Navaho blanket covering the front seat.

Stick-shift Volvo station wagon with a dent in one back door.  Stickers on the
back window for Rice and Oberlin.  Missing one wheel cover on each side.

Got any others?
B.
