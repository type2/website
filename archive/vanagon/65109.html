Jahan,

These are tires I've seen used on campers.

Bridgestone 185 R 14, RD-603, 8-ply rated, D load range, 1850 lbs. _at_ 65
psi.  This tire is listed in the dealers catalog as the 603-V (although it
could be 603-B).  Loaded revolutions per mile are 811.  This tire seems to
be the easiest to find in my area.  Firestone tire dealers usually stock
them.  It's four-rib tread design is a mild all-season and looks similar to
the Y-356.  Prices for an installed set of four range from $336 to $412,
but Tire Rack mail order sells for $61 each.  There is also a C load range
that has supposedly been discontinued but still somewhat available.  For
more technical info., call Bridgestone at 1-800-754-2530.

Toyo LT 195/75 14, Z-24, 8-ply rated, $79 to $99 per tire, not installed.
I met a Vanagon owner who raved about their stability and easier steering
compared to the original equipment Continentals.  It has a four-rib mild
all-season tread design.  When I called Toyo for technical specs., I was
told the tire has been discontinued.  Winston tire dealers stock this tire
and they seem to have lots of them.

Yokohama LT 195/75 14, Y-356, &quot;Super Van 356&quot;, 8-ply rated, load range D,
1710 lbs. _at_ 65 psi.  Loaded revolutions per mile: 808.  $58 at Tire Rack
mail order.  This is the lowest price heavy duty tire I could find.
Four-rib mild all-season tread design has three fairly wide (about 6mm)
grooves between blocks of tread.  The two outside ribs are pretty much
solid rubber.  There is also a load range C version.

Michelin XC4S 185R14 C PR6, 6-ply rated, 1710 lbs. _at_ 55 psi.,  European
commercial rated.  The tread design looks like an aggressive all season
style, or a mild snow tread.  It reminds me of the Goodyear Wrangler, with
four
rows of diagonal blocks.  I have a set of the XC4S and the tire is quiet on
pavement, but those big blocks of rubber are wiggley and can wear unevenly
if you do not rotate
frequently.  Because of the uneven wear I recently decided to buy a second
set of tires for usually dry pavement.  Bob  Bellanca recently found these
for about $365 per set, installed, at Costco.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        The choices for tires are sure becoming meager. From the
&gt;        archives, I've gleaned the following popular options for my
&gt;        (new to me) 91 Westy, non-syncro w/alloys:
&gt;
&gt;        Michelin MXT 205/70R14
&gt;        Reinforced 6-ply
&gt;        Approx. $93 in SF Bay Area
&gt;
&gt;        Yokohama Y370 LT 195/75R14
&gt;        Light Truck 8-ply
&gt;        Unavailable in SF Bay Area
&gt;
&gt;        The tire dealer said the Yoko Y370 has been replaced by the
&gt;        SD05, otherwise known as the &quot;Super Digger&quot; for $71. The name
&gt;        Super Digger conjures images of an aggressive tread pattern,
&gt;        and howling tire noise on the Interstate as a result. A call
&gt;        to Yokohama HQ to confirm the demise of the Y370, a perennial
&gt;        listserv favorite, has yet to be returned.
&gt;
&gt;        The tire dealer said the Y370's 195/75R14 is not the
&gt;        recommended aspect ratio for a top-heavy Westy, and that
&gt;        185/80R14 or 205/70R14 are the only suitable choices. He said
&gt;        he's seen two Westys with the Y370s where the tire had
&gt;        separated. He wasn't too hip on these, as you can surmise.
&gt;
&gt;        The only other choice the dealer has available was one I'd
&gt;        never heard of:
&gt;
&gt;        Cooper Signet 185/80SR14
&gt;        8-ply
&gt;        $63
&gt;
&gt;        Has anyone ever heard of this tire brand?
&gt;
&gt;        Does anyone know if the Yokohama Y370 is still available?
&gt;
&gt;        Does anyone have any other recommendations that are less
&gt;        expensive, and/or better than the Michelins?
&gt;
&gt;        If you respond directly to me, I will gather up the responses
&gt;        and post the findings to the group.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        Thanks,
&gt;
