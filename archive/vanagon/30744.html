I am yet another new list member.  I am a student at the
university of virginia, but i am from toledo, ohio.  i will be
heading to the homeland for a week or so and i was wondering if
anyone knew of any vw graveyards either somewhere en route to
ohio from virginia or of any on ohio or southern michigan.  
i am also interested in any in the virginia area.  Thanks in
advance for any info.  
	As for my van, it is an 86 GL (140 K).  I have a small
coolant leak, but i think i have isolated it to the heat pump
(similar to someone elses leak, sorry i can't remember whose,
but i think it was the 85 that was getting a lot of
responses).  I am also in search of a sliding door panel, any
help would be much appreciated.

peace love and steely dan
