Subject: AC Compressor Replacement, 1985

Does anyone have a good source for AC Parts for vanagons?  I have been
working with I.C.E. of San Diego, but it seens every time I call them the
prices go up or down depending on who you talk to.  Also, there seems to be
no agreement at there shop as to which format to use, R-12 or R-134.  I
asked them about the new Penzoil FR-12 replacement freon, but they have not
used it yet.  I need to replace my Sanden 510 compressor and the dryer.
Thanks,

Bill Lund
