&lt;&lt; That's not correct.  They are only part of the evaporator support and I
think provide relatively little of the support.  There is also a series of
fasteners at the rear of the evap unit at the ceiling level.  In addition to
that, the primary support is provided by 3 bolts along each side near the
front of the evap unit.  These bolts came in 2 arrangements depending on your
model year. &gt;&gt;

I forgot about the 3 little bolts that bolt the plastic evap housing on each
side.
These plastic tabs where the 3 bolts go into were both cracked on each side,
and that, along with removing both side panels, resulted in the evap falling
down from the cieling. Still would have been a good idea to support it with a
piece of wood.
