&gt; Hi all.  As I'm hoping to go on a short camping trip this weekend, I was

&gt; windows.
&gt; If so, how did they attach (inside or outside)
  
on my '85, the screens clip into the inside under/over/around the window
frames

&gt; and does anyone know of a source for new ones?  

 haven't a clue, but would like to know, as I have just broke one trying
to remove it to get a better look at it.  damn I'm smooth.
