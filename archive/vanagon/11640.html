Subject: Re: redrock potluck

&gt;Anyone want to try for another of our famous potlucks at Redrock?  A few
&gt;of us burned out on 6 meals of fish chowder at Big Sur, so how about
&gt;something different this time?  Clam chowder?  Stew?  Pasta?  Tacos?
&gt;Hamburgers?  Chicken?

How about veggie/turkey chili? Or a bring-your-own-meat barbeque would be fun.
