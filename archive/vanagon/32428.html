&gt;I know its not the same thing, but can you go with bigger tires (outside
&gt;diameter) to get the desired effect -- less RPM's at highway speed.
&gt;Yeah, that long hill that I can hold at 50 mph in 4th would probably
&gt;now need to be ascended in 3rd, but my 3rd gear would be taller too.

Been there, done that with the V6anagon, Tom. Switching from the
stock 195R14s to 225R14s, made virtually no appreciable difference that
I could tell. If you run the numbers, the 195/75R14s have a diameter
of 25.43 inches, while the 225/75R14s are 27.18 inches-- a seven percent
difference. Yup, it's a little, but not a whole bunch.
