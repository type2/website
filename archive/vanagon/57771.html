&gt;Two unrelated incidents over the last 3 days indicate something about
&gt;the inherent safety of the Vanagon:

one of the reasons that i think *I* have been lucky in the buses over the
last 27 years, is that the LACK of a front end tends to make you a bit more
attentive. imho. at least *I* think so. so YOU have to pay more attention
to what you and everyone else is doing.

this is what i think turns many people away from the vw buses ... they think
that they are safer in a bigger front-engined american or japanese minivan
... cause they have &quot;protection&quot;. what it means to them is that they no longer
have to be as careful or pay as much attention.

example (my pet peeve!): i've seen any number of people in &quot;minivans&quot; riding
around, yakking inattentively in traffic on their cell phones. i have YET to
a single bus or Vanagon or Eurovan driver talking on a cell phone in traffic.
:)  just another indication that WE are superior in intellect AND application
of that intellect. ;)

of course, the Microbus folks might claim to be even more intellectual ...
they don't even HAVE cell phones in their Splitties!! :)

anyway, my point being that most accidents are the result of driver
INattention. period. one or more of the driver's involved wasn't paying
attention. this includes &quot;driving too fast for the conditions&quot; and &quot;following
too close&quot;. it all comes down to &quot;driver error&quot; ... and in my opinion, the
VW buses don't let you get this complacent. i wonder about Lexus drivers ...
if you've never sat in one, go to a dealer (it helps to dress well first)
and sit in one. test drive it if you can. it is DANGEROUSLY quiet!!! fer real.
and it makes me wonder if those people actually realize that they are in
control of and responsible for a two-ton machine!!! i think not.

so go out and hug your bus tomorrow. tell it you're sorry for all those names
you've called it as you tried to acclerate up those on-ramps. :)  it's been
trying to keep you safe. ;)
