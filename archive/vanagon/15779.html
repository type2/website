Subject: Cheap places to camp

I was wondering if there are any other road trippers without money out
there?  If there are, where do you camp for the night while you are on the
road?  Rest Stops?  How much is a state park per night out west?  How much
are national parks?  Are there any other options?  Can I write anything but
questions?
