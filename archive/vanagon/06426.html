Subject: Re: west pretour pack.list

 
Martha tells us, that...
 
&gt;Without getting too involved, here's a list of things...
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
(shortened and slightly permutated version of her huge listy list deleted)
 
(then, for special effect, she adds:)
&gt;Does anyone have one of those popcorn makers you use over a campfire?
 
Wow, martha. I got your other list from the archives (which will help a lot for
my own little trips), and seriously, thanks for the ideas.
 
But I just gotta ask if you have one of them there mid-bus Buick V-8s pushing
your travelling warehouse.
 
BTW, if the west coast trip is actually 1/8 or so, I'm going to be way bumed. A
buddy &amp; I are going from WI to NM, and I figger what's a few more hunnert miles?
Unfortunately, he needs to catch a flight out of Madison on the 10th. D'oh! So
close, yet so far.
