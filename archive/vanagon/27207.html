&gt; Well then anyone buying a pre '66 vehicle in California is immoral and 
&gt; selfish.  Since they don't require any smog testing, and most likely put

I have to agree with Mr. Magnesium on this one.  IMO emissions testing
should consist of a sniffer test only.  After all, that's what counts.
Failing an inspection because you have upgraded to a cleaner running
engine is ludicrous.  The current laws in California force you to use
the original equipment, even if it means higher emissions.  If you want
to put a fuel-injected BMW V-12 engine into a 65 bus you should be
able to do it, as long as it doesn't pollute more than the original
1500 (right)? engine (which isn't likely).  And as long as I'm
bitching, which is more important, clean air or safety?  California has
*no* safety inspection.  You don't have to have functioning brakes, turn
signals, headlights, or seatbelts to pass &quot;inspection&quot; in California.
Implementing a safety inspection would take many old cars off the road
and do more for clean air than the ridiculous emission laws.  Not that
I'm in favor of getting rid of emissions limits - I'm not.  It's just
that in California they are poorly implemented.
