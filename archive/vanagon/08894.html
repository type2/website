As the subject lines says.  This happened sometime yesterday or
the day before and I missed it!  Oh well.  Tune up time.  Let's
see, spark plugs, rotor, cap, spark plugs, oxygen sensor.  BTW
did anybody find out a make and model Ford car that I can tell
the Dealer I'm buy their O2 senser for?  

Check belts, hoses, brakes.  Anything else?  I'll change the 
coolant after the Pfieffer trip.  Just changed the oil/filter and
yes I always put some oil in the filter before I screw it on thank
you very much Ari.  ;)  

That's all I can think of.
