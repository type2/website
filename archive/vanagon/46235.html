&gt;Subject: Broken hydraulic lifter '86 Question

&gt;
&gt; Hi all:  I had a cylinder head gasket leak, which pressurized the water
&gt;tank.  The engine had 20,000 miles on it since it had new heads.  I've torn
&gt;the engine down and didn't find any serious looking problems.  Now, while
&gt;putting it back together, I noticed a keeper is missing out of one of the
&gt;hydraulic lifters, and a chip is missing out of the top of the lifter body.
&gt;
&gt;        My question is:  Since the keeper was gone, would it be possible
&gt;that this is what caused the head gasket failure?  My thinking is that
&gt;because the keeper was missing it allowed the lifter to pump up way too far
&gt;and pushed on the valve far enough to cause the spring to bind; thereby
&gt;pushing out on the head, causing the gasket to leak.  There was no piston
&gt;damage from the valve hitting. 
&gt;
&gt;        What do you think?
