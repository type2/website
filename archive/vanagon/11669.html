&gt;Have you noticed in winter, when the van is somewhat warm, when you turn a
&gt;corner or brake hard you can feel a slosh of cold air on the back of your
&gt;neck? I imagine that behind me, there is a layer of warm air sitting on
&gt;top of a bigger layer of cold air, and when the van changes direction, the
&gt;big base layer of cold air slops around abit.
&gt;Not an earthshaking observation, but one that reminds you how much air
&gt;behaves like a liquid.

want to have some more fun? :)  get a couple of small-to-medium sized
helium-filled balloons and turn them loose inside the bus, THEN go rounding
the corners. and also try some quick stops. &lt;recommend that you do this in
a big empty parking lot ... so your fascination doesn't lead to a fender-
bender!&gt;

&gt;Alistair, recently fascinated by fluid dynamics after Rain-Xing his
&gt;windshield and watching those mercury-like blobs of water scoot across, Bell

ah, well ... there are those what are easily fascinated. ;)  be a bit wary of
those blobs, however. i found that Rain-x tricked my eyes into thinking that
i was going slower than i actually was (or alternately: that it wasn't
raining as hard as it really was). so i wound up having to brake harder than
i thought i should. (and then there are those what are easily tricked ... ) ;)
