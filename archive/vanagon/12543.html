Subject: Re: weakly stats: how many possums crossed the road?

&gt;entirely tooooo many 'Unknowns',

I dunno, I just got here.  Does that make me an unknown?

I gotta 73 sunroof bus with the left rear recently bashed courtesy of a
delivery truck and the sliding door recently bashed courtesy of a hit and
runner.  

I found a door through alt.rec.vw and should be getting fixed in a week or
so.  Somebody there suggested I might want to come here.

My metal crank-operated slide back sunroof has a sag at the back and needs
help.  Any sunroof gurus around here?
