Subject: Camping Update!
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 97 12:56:00 EST

Hey all,
I know this camping update has been long in coming.  Sorry.  The biggest
question of all is &quot;Where will we be camping?&quot;  

Truth is, I don't really know, but thanks to Steve Dolan, Tom Forhan and
John Anderson, we might be able to work something definitive out here.

Tom offered last night to look through some of his camping materials for
ideas.  He wrote me a couple e-mails today with some good ideas.  John
Anderson has also offered to look through his camping guides and get
back to me.  Steve was the original helper-outer but unfortunately was
unable to turn up any open campgrounds through his connections.  I
greatly appreciate everyone's assistance.  

Now, the first campsite Tom wrote to me about is in Virginia on the
Eastern Shore.  It is Kiptopeke State Park.  It's located a bit north of
the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  There is a web site with information at
http://www.state.va_dot_us:80/~dcr/parks/kiptopek.htm.

Kiptopeke opens for business on March 1.  They have campsites with
electric hookups, but unfortunately no group sites.  The rates for
electric &amp; water sites are $17.22 and the rates for campsites with no
hookups are $13.40.  Both of these are not including VA's 4.5% sales
tax.  

The next is in Eastern Maryland, called Janes Island State Park.  They
have campsites w/ electric hookups for $13.  There was no info on the
web site as to when they parks open, but if enough interest is shown for
this location, I'll give 'em a call.       

There is Assateague Island on Maryland's Eastern Shore, but there are no
electric hookups.  I kinda want a campground w/ electric hookups just in
case it's cold. 
Both of the MD sites can be seen at
http://www.gacc_dot_com/dnr/All/Eastern/ 

Tom also mentioned the many private campgrounds on the Eastern Shore.
He made the point that they are more expensive and &quot;less fun&quot; than the
state parks.  I'd kinda like to avoid the commercial ones if possible,
but like I said, I'm pretty flexible.

SO, I want comments from all the interested campers.  The date is set
for the weekend of the 7th of March.  Go visit the web sites and cast
your votes.  Of course, if anyone wants to make an addition to the list
please do!  I want as much information on what's out there as possible.
The above campsites are not meant to be the only 3 under consideration.

Looking forward to hearing from you all,
Sean
