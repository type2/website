Subject: Vanagon List Instructions

We need a good all around file that we can post around cyberspace telling
newbees how to sign up for join and use the Vanagon list. ...something that
explains to them exactly how to join and how it works. 

People on Compuserve are asking me how to sign up and I'm not sure what to
tell them exactly.
