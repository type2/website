Subject:      Re: Synthetic Oils

Well folks,

I too am very thankful for all the feedback on synthetic vs. mineral oils
debate. After much research I opted to go with a synthetic oil (Mobil 1,
15/50). It seemed the biggest opposing factors were either the cost or the
number of miles your motor had been running conventional mineral oil. Since
my '90 Westy only has 7k on a new motor I opted to go synthetic.

As for my '91 CRX and my wife's '91 Corolla, both with just over 100k, I
may decide to stay with conventional oils.

As for the Westy, she seems to be running with a few more ponies, but, that
could be my imagination. I also added an octane boost to clean my fuel
tank, lines, and injectors. Between the two, she seems to be running pretty
smooth.

Thanks for all the help!

Chris

&gt;I have been enjoying the discussion on oils.  I am amazed at the knowledge
&gt;on the list.  One more question - can you mix synthetic oils.  If you can,
&gt;if you mix 5-50 with 10-30 in 50/50 proportions, do you get 7.5-40?
&gt;
&gt;I have been running Castrol Syntec for several years now.  I cannot make up
&gt;my mind about 5-50 vs 10-30, so can I mix them?
