Subject: 2 thumbs up from charlie Hamill


i took my 60 crew cab over to charlie hamill's place (aka, the bus stop) 
on friday to let him have a look.  he has been telling me to stop  by 
when it is running so he can have a look.  I was a little nervious 
because he is the bus king, but i went over anyway.  he gave my truck a 
thorough going over and was impressed.  he pointed out that i had the 
wrong color on my hub caps and a few other minor things, but overall he 
liked it.  boy, that made my day.  i have a few things that i am trying 
to fix right now so that i can call it totally done.  now i have to 
figgure out what to do with it.  i can not really drive it anywhere for 
fear of theft and shopping carts.  i guess i will have to continue to 
drive my bug around till i get another bus.

Things that still need doing:
rebuild the brakes.  i need a new master cylender and flexable brake lines
get my licens plates back.  they are being restored right now
repaint the hub caps.  i did then in dark grey, but according to charlie, 
     the light grey trucks had the same color hub caps.
install radio, have to have toons.  don't worry, i am cuttung nothing and it
	will mostly be hidden
install (read still find) a stearing lock.  anybody have a broken unit????
fix turn sigs.  the rear tail light wont flash and now the turn sig light on
	the dash lights up when the brake peddle is pushed.  humm, 
	anybody know why this may happen.  i think i need to replace the 
	turn signal unit.  anybody got a extra one????? 
 
after all that, i can call it done.  


take care and God Bless
matt
