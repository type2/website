&gt; Well, here we go again. The Blue Paz pooped on died on the freeway this morning. It started blowing
&gt; heavy black smoke, hesitating, gaging, and all of a sudden, it died. It wouldn't start at all. I got in
&gt; the motor messed around with a few wires, fuel-filter, and tapped on the distributor....and then
&gt; it started right-up. After that it ran nicely! I was so excited that I found myself going 90mph....
&gt; The fun didn't last long b'cause when I got to work it died again. *&amp;*&amp;*(&amp;* it, I just came in to
&gt; release my frustration on my computer.
&gt; 

If I were you, I'd try and figure out what item you jiggled when you were on the
side of the road.  That's a damn big clue as to what's wrong with your van.
