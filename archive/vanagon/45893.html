Subject: The KC Run - Four



                     The KC Run -- Heading Home

I had two passengers in the bus when I rolled down the drive of
the Polys' home heading for San Diego.  Hanna Polys, 4, gifted me
with a tiny figurine of a lamb.  Her six year old sister Abbie
gave me a little black and white puppy.  Not a real one, a
stuffed toy puppy with 'Babe' on a satin tag sewn to its bottom. 
The pair formed a tiny menagerie on my dashboard, the lamb taking
in everything with wide-eyed curiousity while the puppy dozed,
button-eyes closed.

Having enjoyed the benefits of trucker-derived travel advisories
I chose to plan the homeward route myself, deciding to head west
until I could pick up the Sante Fe railroad and follow it home, a
plan that worked well for me in the past when navigating cross-
country in light airplanes.

My westward course took me to the vicinity of Salina, Kansas
where I picked up Highway 56, which parallels the railway for
most of its length.  The weather was hot and humid but my course
skirted the big anvil-topped clouds abuilding to the south.

Getting a late start on Sunday morning, I motored across the
American steppes as far as Liberal, Kansas, freshly washed by a
thunderstorm minutes before my arrival.  I had supper with Mr.
Dillard Smith and his friends, during which matters of
international importance were discussed and the Bosnian problem
resolved.  Then we all had ice cream and promised to do it again
the next time I blew thru town.  I had never met Mr. Dillard
Smith or his friends before I wandered into the restaurant next
to the Last Best-Western Motel in Kansas but their kindness to a
stranger was one of the high points of the trip.

Monday saw me flit across the Oklahoma panhandle toward
Stratiford, Texas, where I've kin long unvisited, divorced from
we poorer Hoovers when their thousands of acres of dry land
proved to be the cap of a huge dome filled with natural gas.  I
didn't bother to look them up.  Last I heard, they were cruising
the Alaskan fjords in their yacht.

Soon after entering Texas the country changed, falling under the
rain shadow of mountains to the west too distant to see.  Sage
brush reappeared as the land became drier, climbing in a slow
slant toward the continental divide.

North of Liberal I had cut south to pick up Highway 54 and was
now on a long slant toward Tucumcari, New Mexico, scanning the
horizon for a landmark mentioned in the accounts of Cortez' lieutenants
searching for the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola.  

The first mesas appeared, dim blue bergs adrift on the horizon. 
Shortly after, I spotted the stepped-pyramid shape that lured the
Spanish explorers north.  It remained in view, growing steadily,
for the next two hours and marked the intersection of Highway 54
with Interstate 40 at Tucumcari.  Once a sacred place, the mesa atop
a mesa is adorned with antennas, feeding laff-tracks and cell-phones
to a population that has largely forgotten their roots.

For me, the magic is still there.  Were I forced to live anywhere other
than California, where I was born, northeastern New Mexico would be
high on my list.  I don't know why but I feel comfortable there.

Deborah Polys had restocked my larder with the Kansas City
version of bagles, strange doughy things useless in a rock fight. 
A proper bagle is a deadly weapon in skilled hands.  I gummed the
gooey things, sipped my coffee and was content, rolling west up
the incline of the nation at a steady fifty miles per hour.

There's no secret to traveling long distances in a low-powered
vehicle, you simply keep it rolling.  Of course, having a bladder
the size of a seabag helps.  Four times during the day a little
Geo with California plates squirted past, each time saluting me
with growing fervor.  Some trucks passed me as many as six times,
roaring by at eighty only to dawdle at a restaurant or weigh
station, allowing me to catch them up and pass them by, the
dependable tortose out-pacing the diesel-powered hare.

I kept it rolling, sipped my coffee, enjoying a tart dried
apricot now and then as the sun arced across the sky and setting,
pulled me into Flagstaff after a sixteen hour run.  

Flagstaff has always seemed a bit strange to me.  Odd things
happen each time I go there.  While refueling the bus a couple of
skinny Indian kids said something rude to me in gang-sign then
tried to pick a fight when I answered them in kind.  I'm not sure
what they were smoking they should give it up.  Two belligerent
teenagers are no match for an armed man unwilling to be spat
upon.  I've been there, did that.  And have the scars to prove
it.  

If you have to eat in Flagstaff don't do it at the Mason Jar. 
And the best place to sleep is in your vehicle, at the truck stop
west of town.

By the time I reached Flagstaff the engine-hour meter told me it
was time for an oil change, which I did at the truck stop,
observed by legions of truckers having breakfast in the
restaurant.  The CB provided a running commentary on my progress
from the truckers in their vehicles.  &quot;I think he's gonna
overhaul that thing,&quot; when I set up my card table and laid out my
tools.  I also checked the tranny -- eleven ounces down -- and
the steering, loose but serviceable.  The engine had consumed a
quart of oil over the last two thousand miles and that worried
me.  But it's not a new engine and I'd asked a lot of it during
the trip.  I tightened my fan belt and checked the spare.  Ahead
lay the desert and that single fan belt runs the entire cooling
system.  Finished, tools packed up, table folded and stowed,
work-shirt replaced with driving-shirt, I faced the windows of
the restaurant and gave the truckers an elaborate bow.  Many of
them had passed me several times the day before.

Within minutes of leaving Flagstaff the temperature was over 90,
climbing steadily as I descended into the basin of the Colorado
River.  At the rest stop south of Kingman the temperature was an
incredible 121, a warm day even by Arizona standards.  I saw a
Westy there, apparently being rebuilt by a young couple.  They
had water and shade and seemed to know their business.  They gave
me an incurious stare but didn't return my wave.  I rolled on by.

I crossed back into California below the Needles and pulled up at
the agricultural inspection station wearing my desert towel, the
Stones pounding out 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction' on the stereo. 
The kid in the booth grinned and gave me a victory sign.  I was
back on my home turf.

Crossing the Mohave during the heat of the day isn't smart but I
was anxious to get home.  I rigged my squirt bottle, an adjunct
to the desert towel.  You fill a spray bottle with water and keep
yourself wetted down.  You can't open the windows because the
air-blast is like a furnace, drying out your eyes and nasal
membranes.  So you squirt yourself with water, wear your wet
towel and keep on rolling, albeit slowly.  The oil temp refused
to stay below 220 if I ran more than 45 mph so that's what I did,
all the way to Barstow more than five hours away.

When I left California, the high desert was burning.  When I
returned, the foothills were burning.  Below Cajon Pass the smog
and smoke and heat haze limited visibility to less than a mile, a
sad change from the desert where peaks a hundred miles distant
were sharply defined.  But it was cooler here, barely ninety.  I
dueled my way through the traffic, kicking the speed up to sixty-
five to keep from being rammed in the rear, gluing myself in the
proper lanes and hanging in there despite attacks from both
quarters and astern.  It took an hour to cross the basin during
which I saw more cars than I'd seen in the previous two weeks.

Our house is on a hill, in sight of the sea.  We have a steep
front drive that runs down to the mail box and a easier, unpaved
back-road into the property.  I motored down the back drive at
ten minutes past six, precisely thirteen hours after leaving
Flagstaff, 593 miles away.  My wife was home and helped me carry
in my bags.  I guess I looked a little frazzled because she asked
&quot;How was the desert?&quot;

&quot;Hot,&quot; I said.  She gave me some iced tea and we sat in the
patio.  Scarface, our big raggedy-eared tomcat, came over and
climbed in my lap.  It was about seventy with a nice breeze
coming in off the sea.  &quot;Pretty but hot.&quot;

&quot;Did he like the engine?&quot;

&quot;I think so.&quot;  I showed her the pictures Bob Polys had taken
during our work on the Spyder then introduced her to my two
passengers.  She smiled but didn't say anything.  I'd been gone
sixteen days, traveled 3,393 miles in 69.4 hours of engine-time. 
It was nice to be home.
