i have some limited experience, i replaced mine in my 80 vanagon.

the stuff in the AT is red stuff that is thinner than oil, as far as i can
remember.  If it is really this that is leaking then it will actually
clean grease off of the bellhousing... at least mine did.  the dead
giveaway that this seal is leaking will be that it slings fluid all over
the underside of the car where it combines with everything else under
there to form a black sludge.  so, the fluid is thin, but it easily
combines with road grime to produce a thick black sludge.

to fix it, drop the engine, get the correct torque convertor bearing from
VW and the correct seal.  install the seal properly or it may just get cut
up in the process necessitating doing the whole thing over again.

it wasnt too hard on my 80, i would guess that even though your 91 has a
different AT it would be a very similar procedure.

if i am wrong, please flame away :)
