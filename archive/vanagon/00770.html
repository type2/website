&gt;BTW I just bought one of those handy wiring harness fixes 025 906 302A and
&gt;it doesn't cost $40!!!!!  All of the dealers I called quoted exactly $95!!!

ouch!! i got two for $38 each, plus COD UPS shipping!

... well, i just called Jim Ellis VW in Atlanta, GA (800) 653-5547 and talked
to the guy there (Joe Baisle), and sure enough, the Retail Price for that
little sucker is $95!!!   he said he could sell it for $80.75.

i guess since they sent out that second Tech Bulletin, for ALL water-cooled
engines, vw must a seen a way to pay for all those GM law-suits in germany. :(
sorry.

&gt;On a side note:  Who is all going to BBTA???

well ... i'm semi-planning on trying to look at the possibilities fo going.
