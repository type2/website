&gt; Jacks are different, square post on a bus, round on a Vanagon, I'd like
&gt; to note the OEM Bilstein jacks used to 7?' with the nut you turned by
&gt; your lug wrench were much much stronger than the one that came stock in
&gt; our '76 with the built in crank handle, I've never seen an earlier one
&gt; broken, 

The jack in my '71 breaks occasionaly...the pin that holds the
gear on the shaft sheared off. Every couple of years I have to 
fashion a new pin. I also carry a floor jack and a bottle jack
with me [grin]
