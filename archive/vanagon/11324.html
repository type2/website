&gt;&gt;There is a recall on July 86 to Jan 87 on the idle stabilizer, main &gt;control

&gt;info. VWofA will replace ALL of the above so &gt;check it out, in FAQ I assume.
&gt; For Syncros and non. My Syncro &gt;was made Feb 87, tim 'no luck' s.

&gt;Tell me this is so Joel &quot;Data Bank&quot; Walker.  My syncro was produced in
&gt;November 1986, and I wasn't aware of the recall  Do you have any other
&gt;information concerning the recall?????  What does campaign PB mean???  
&gt;


I had an 87 Synchro and had the worst time with it just cutting off while 
driving down the highway.  It also had like zero power up hills and the 
like.  Someone then told me about some &quot;ghost harness&quot;.  I didn't try it 
before getting rid of it, but I know someone else that did and seems to have 
worked.
