Subject: Gas heater boosters

Hello,

I just joined the list (70 poptop) and am about to bring up a topic that
probably gets regularily beaten to death: auxillary gas heaters. (I've
scanned the archive and got some good information there, just need some
details)

A good friend of mine, who happens to run a shop for air-cooled VWs , 
sold me an auxillary heater that he pulled off an 82 Vanagon. The heater 
is in excellent shape but needs a few parts. Specifically, the safety 
switch that mounts under the dash has a crack in the cover and I'd like 
to replace it. Any suggestions on tracking one down or should I just send 
my wallet over to the local dealer? What about other parts like the spark 
plug,  etc.?

The mechanic and I were poring over this thing last night and were trying 
to figure out the purpose of the smallish diameter flexible tube that 
runs from a frame member forward to the combustion fan. The factory 
manual stressed the importance of installing this tube correctly, so we 
will, but what is its purpose in life?

I think I got a good deal for the heater-- $100 if I let John (the 
mechanic) put it in. He's estimating about $200-300 in labor. Feedback on 
this would be nice, too.

Thanks a lot.
