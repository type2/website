Subject: Battery's bust!

So... More on Moo our 88 Westfalia.  When we bouth the camper a ccouple 
of months back, the machine started like a champ.  But I was babying it, 
as men do with new toys, and it sat in the driveway 77 being washed and 
preened for a week or so.  When I went to start it one day. the starter 
barely turned over, but the engine caught.  Old battery I thought.  

Off we went to the US and Southern Ontario, and the machine was a drean, 
no starting problems.  Back home, in the drive, with not a lot of use, 
the battery seems to die a slow death and I sometimes do the roll and 
clutch start thing.

So here's the question... I assume the battery in Moo is orginal 
equipment.  ( It looks that way ) SSo, its, what eight years old... would 
that be about the life span of the VW made battery or should it last 
longer?  I checked and the only permanent drain on the battert is that 
LCD clock behind the steering wheel.  I figure that cant be sucking back 
much &quot;jusic&quot; or can it?   Should I just go get another battery &gt;  A 
question for the list lurkers!!!

Thanks all
