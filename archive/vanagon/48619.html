The point of abs brakes is to keep your wheels from locking during panic stops.  It is well known that a car that is skidding will not stop as quickly as a car with wheels turning.  Skidding results as a loss of friction/traction between tires and road and does not improve your stopping distance at all.  

In addition, skidding relieves the driver of steering control.  You can turn the wheel all you want, but if your front wheels are locked, you will continue straight ahead.  If your back wheels lock, you will observe some wicked fishtailing.  If all wheels lock, you're probably pretty screwed :) .

ABS was designed to give the driver steering control during a panic stop by pumping the brakes more rapidly than a human could possibly pump them.  This keeps the wheels from locking and lets the driver steer clear of danger while braking.

The popular misconception is that ABS reduces stopping distances.  That's not true, and that's not what it's designed to do.  It will reduce the stopping distance compared to a vehicle with locked wheels, but stopping distance should be pretty much the same as the same vehicle with rotating wheels.  The problem is that most people are completely ignorant of what is on their cars, and they feel that ABS makes them invincible, so they wait longer to apply the brakes or they speed more than they usually would or they use the safety feature improperly.
