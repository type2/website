Subject: Re: Engine transplant operation

a new alternator. I paid $650 for all the engine related parts off
&gt;the donor vehicle.


1. Air box, metal braket and associated injection parts (F.I. &quot;Brain&quot;)
&gt;2. Fuel tank and fuel pump.
&gt;3. Exhaust system.
&gt;4. Transmission support brace.
&gt;5. etc.

Who dropped the engine out? I would have expected to get ALL of the engine, 
FI brain right through to the tail pipe(s) for $650. Every bit, no 
exceptions. Hell, demand the tranny and shafts be thrown in for free. You 
will need the fuel pump, the tank???, just take all the plumbing you can 
find. Any other opionions on the tank out there? Some years had a brace, 
others didn't, Will your transmission bolt to a '78 brace at all, or is this 
where MIG/TIG comes in? The closest I've come to your situation was putting 
an '75 1800 FI engine into a '72 1700 bus. I kept the old double carbs on 
however, since I too was stiffed for the FI.  Fitting the FI components onto 
your engine compartment surfaces may take some diligence. I don't have my 
old Bentley for those years to check the procedures in detail. Go for it, a 
2.0 liter engine is as good as life gets in a van, 70-75 mph cruising, 
bearable mileage, easier tune-ups.  tim s.
