&gt; The following invitation comes from Jack and Bev Gustafson of St. Cloud,
MN
&gt; who have sent it to their select list, but it is open to all VW
initiates.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Come and enjoy Central MN's explosion of tree colors or bare limbs with
&gt; your fellow VW enthusiasts on Saturday, Oct. 18th, 1:00 pm.  Meet at
&gt; riverside park in Cold Spring, MN (15 miles south of St. Cloud, off MN
Hwy.
&gt; 23) to start the tour.  Camp FREE near St. Joe, MN for Sat. night.  Bring
&gt; lots of food and firewood!  Please RSVP ASAP.  Call (320) 252-0144 &amp; ask
&gt; for Jack or Bev. (www.zanshin_at_cloudnet_dot_com)&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Jack informs me that the campground has toilets and electrical hookups.
&gt; Also, this is a rain or shine event.
&gt;
&gt; This should be a great weekend activity for anyone who enjoys good
company
&gt; and wonderful scenery.
&gt; I hope to see some of you listees there.
