Subject: Bilsteins for front of Syncros!

Listees,

  I've been trying to find something for the front of the Syncro OTHER than the Boges 
for the people that want more performance! 

  I found them,(With the help of another list member ) that brought to my attention 
that Bilstein may make such a shock I checked with a couple of my sources and found 
this to be TRUE! :)

  I'm happy to hear this due to the fact that I may own a Syncro in the AM and it'll 
probably need a set of shocks if the PO hasn't attended to this area.

  Anyone that wants more info can p-mail me on this topic and I'm more than happy to 
give them info.

  Kyle
