Subject: Installing 2nd Battery

Hi all, Can anyone direct me to Dennis Haynes article on
installing a 2nd battery. I think it was in a LIMBO issue.  I also
misplaced a posting from last week(?) from someone who installed a
trickle charger with his 2nd battery which seemed like the way to go.
Are you out there?
Thanks,
Jay
Is it just the kid in me or does a bus seem like a little clubhouse?
