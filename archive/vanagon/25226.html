Hi,
        Throughout my life I have always had a fascination with TYPE II
volkswagons, and I recently was given the oppurtunity to have my own.  
Being on a tight college budget limits my selection quite a bit and I was 
wondering if any on this list might be able to steer me the right direction.
I have found a 1970 camper bus that is perfect inside but has a rusty back
end and sills.  Their is no motor but the owner ( a VW restorer of 30 years)
assures me the front end and transmission are O.K.  He also has many of the
smaller parts in his garage and said he would be glad to help guide me through
the project of restoration. I don't know too terribly much about engine work so
his help would be essential to my sucsess.  He wants $ 400 for it and believes 
it can be on the road for under $2,000.  I really don't have anything to 
compare this price to since I've never seen a bus for sale in my area 
for under 2,500-3,500$$$.  I was hoping maybe someone could advise me 
on this investment and E-mail me on the availabilty of '70 parts and

Press RETURN for more...

anything else you think I should know.  This has always been my dream, so 
it is realy difficult for me to look at the vehicle objectively...
                        I would greatly appreciate any resposes...
                                        Damian.
