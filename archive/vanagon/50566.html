Subject: Stupid bus tricks and waving

I also tried to change the fuel filter on my old 77 while it was parked on
a hill with a full tank of gas. During this episode I managed to lock my
keys in the car as well.  The ink on the t-shirt I was wearing ran like
melted candle wax from the gas.  It sure was not pretty.
        In town there are lots of buses and Vanagons and though I wave to
them all, only a few respond.  Once out of the city, however, the number
falls and the response rate rises.  It is a novelty thing for sure.

Chris
