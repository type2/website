Subject: rocker panel, what's that?

So this 77 westy is sitting in a nackers yard close to here.  300 will 
take it away but a westy wise friend and I looked at it this weekend.  
hee said the rocker panels are shot that that a bad thing.  what is a 
rocker panel, how much do they cost, how difficult are they to install 
and why are they so important?  

Please and thank!!!!
