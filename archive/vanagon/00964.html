&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;   Question: Should the air which comes out of the rear-passenger ceiling
&gt;&gt;             vents be warm? I had tons of airflow of cold air, no matter what
&gt;&gt;             I tried I couldn't get rear heat. The front heat was fine though.
&gt;
&gt;The ceiling vents only deliver fresh air, which could be warm or cold 
&gt;depending on the outside temp. :-)  One thing I like about the four-lever
&gt;system is its simplicity... top lever for air delivery to the windshield,
&gt;next lever down for temp, next lever for footwell air deliver, and the
&gt;bottom lever for the rear fresh air.  The levers have a different feel to
&gt;them:  The levers for the windshield and footwell are smooth, and the other
&gt;two levers have bumps on them.  Since these bumpy and smooth levers 
&gt;alternate, going from top to bottom, its easy to adjust the flow of air and
&gt;temp without taking your eyes off the road!
&gt;
&gt;Kudos to the VW engineers!

I believe the VW engineers did a good job designing the four lever system.
You can't make it any simpler.  I have no trouble with it but my parents 
still have not figured it out yet and they have been driving it since new!
I have to explain the above each time we go out while they would be moving
levers around.
