Rat Shack (RadioShack) is discontinuing and drastically discounting their
TRC-226 40Channel Portable/12v CB radio.  This little handheld or mobile unit
offers 3.5w into the final (max legal limit), external mic, external speaker,
external antenna features plus the ability to use it as your van CB.

I have one and it's given yeoman service for two years or so.

Check your local ratshack for the TRC-226 Cat # 21-1665.  Should be ~$80.
Previous list was ~$140.  Has built in charger for nicads or runs on alkalines.
Has battery saver features and center loaded whip with optional rubberducky.
