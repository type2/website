Subject:      speakers?

Hi.  Does anyone know which body panels (front doors, rear door) have
spaces that are &quot;designated&quot; for a pair of speakers by the manufacturer??
I'm talking about a '79 westy, but it should be the same for any of the
1970's I would think.  My guess would be that the front doors have a
space for 4&quot; round speakers, but I'm wondering if there's a place for
6x9's in the back.  Thanks

david
