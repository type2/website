Subject:      Re: Towing suggestions/questions for Vanagon

Hi Howard

      We tow our 84 vanagon standard behind the moterhome on all fours with
no problem.  What we had to do was to disconnect the battery, put the
ignition key in to release the steering lock, and put the car in neutral.
 Only disadvantage is that the milage goes up when towed.
     I do not recommend this for an automatic.  Automatic's need the drive
wheels on a dolly to prevent wear on the bearing and transmission.
