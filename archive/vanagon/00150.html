Subject: Re: Syncro

How did you get THAT piece of information about the viscous coupling being
shared with the Honda Civic 4WD. The owner of Adventurewagen which was doing
non-Westy camper conversions for Vanagon told me that line about Porsche
designing the viscous coupling unit and Steyr-Damler-Punch buiding the front
diff. He even said the name of the Porsche engineer or contact guy on this
was a Peter Mutke, someone involved with racing.

I know that sounds a little odd, but who is right? Is the viscous coupling
unit actually interchangeable with the Honda Civic?!?!

By the way, e-mail from Germany here today says that the Syncro is assembled
in the same factory and by the same people/employees/workers that make the
Mercedes G-Wagon. 

I am composing a detailed technical letter to Steyr-Daimler-Punch tonight
about adding the diff lock to the front final drive unit. They sent me (SDP)
an engineering diagram with part numbers showing the front diff but I still
have some questions for them.
