Subject: vanagon.list group trip!


What about a group trip, fellow van.list people?  A caravan winding
across the country both directions, or perhaps up to Alaska?  Or....?
Think of the GREAT (lyrics for) songs around the campfire!  ;)

Seriously, if there's a collective interest in this, I volunteer
help organize.....
