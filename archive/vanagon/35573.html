Subject: swap meet stuff

As we crossed Florida yesterday from SW to NE, I stopped at a swapmeet
I'd seen advertised in Hemmings.  It was in Webster FL, pretty good-
sized swapmeet, but heavily oriented toward American iron.  I did buy
a few things.  Perfect sales brochure for 1982 Vanagon (closest they
had to my 81.  Noticed that the Vgon on the front of the brochure is
actually a 1980 (by the air intakes).  Also picked up two old Clymer
manuals, one for 1980/81 Vanagon, the other for 1980-1982 Vanagon (about
20 pages of diesel differences supplementing the original content.)
They are both in &quot;keep under the driver's seat&quot; condition, not in col-
lectors condition but none of the pages are stuck together or missing.

I want to keep the 80/81 book, but make me some piddling offer for the
second one.  Also for the 81 steering wheel that I took off when I
put on the smaller late wheel.
