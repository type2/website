Howdy y'ns:

I was talking to an acquaintance the other day about pre-68 
transmissions, and he says there is a company somewhere that will 
rebuild your tranny with a &quot;Freeway Flier gear.&quot;

Does anyone have any information on this?  What is the final gear 
ratio of a stock, and this freeway final ratio?

Any ideas on the price for the rebuild w/ gear?

Has anyone had experince with this?

Thanks for any opinions!
