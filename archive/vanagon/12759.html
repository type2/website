Subject: RE: VW SIGHTINGS

There were three different Oscar Meyer Weinermobiles at this year's
Chicago Auto Show - none were VW-related, and the historical displays
of many other moving sausages didn't give hints of VW-ness.

One other TV sighting:

On the news a couple of weeks ago, about the woman who threw her kids
off the Long Beach bridge (and then herself) there was a white bay-window
parked, doors open, at an angle on the bridge.

I thought &quot;oh, no, bad p.r. for bus owners&quot;, but later articles said
she was walking along the bridge, pushing a stroller.

So that means the bus belonged to a Good Samaritan, right, gang?

Or does it mean that that was Dr. Kevorkian's bus?
