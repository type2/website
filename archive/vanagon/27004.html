hi, all,
i just joined the list yesterday and boy is it a busy thing...
anyway, i just had one quick spec.-type question, if i may
(i did check various books and faq's but didn't get an answer)--
what is the height of a '70's westfalia, with stock tires, suspension,etc?
(yes, this is a will-it-fit-in-the-garage question)

i know the bus was originally 1.9meters but wasn't sure about the camper
conversion. i don't (yet) have one handy to measure...

just point me to a source if that's easier. don't want to make you all run
to your garages with tape measures. :)

thanks much
Carolyn Cullen
