Subject: 85 waterboxer problem

I have a problem with my 85 waterboxer.  Can anyone help?

Description:  85 1.9 litre waterboxer.  Fuel injection, automatic tranny.

Work done:  I rebuilt the engine (bearings were bad) this past summer.  I
have driven the van about 600 miles since then.

The Problem:  I can start the van just fine and drive it anywhere.  If I turn
the engine off, I will not be able to restart the engine for 30-45 minutes.
 The engine will turn over but will not catch.  I get a good spark to all
plugs.  When the engine is running I get black, wet soot from the tail pipe
that smells like gasoline.  When I turn the engine off, I can smell the
engine compartment reaking of fuel.

Can anyone help me pinpoint the problem?
