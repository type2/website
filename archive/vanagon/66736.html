&gt;I have scanned the Auth cartoon I noted a week or so ago.  Gerry has rejected
&gt;the file as too big, so if anyone wants a copy, please let me know directly.

How big is too big?  I downloaded it from the Inquirer website - it's
called AUTHCARTOON23.GIF and it's all of 18k.  I can ftp it wherever...
