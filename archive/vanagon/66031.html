&gt; Does anyone know this for sure.  Not anecdotal evidence but scientific (
&gt; I will settle for pseudo scientific) evidence.  I recently had my fridge
&gt; serviced at an RV place that knew the 182B backwards and forwards.  They
&gt; really impressed me with their ability and knowledge.  I asked them about
&gt; the fan since they had some for sale.  They said that you don't need it
&gt; for the 182B (thus denying themselves a sale of a fan to me).  I must
&gt; admit it works well without it (although I haven't tried making ice
&gt; cubes).
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone out there have any data on this?

Derek Drew did a lot of investigation into this, and while he doesn't list
his data here, my recollection is that he (or someone else) had the data to
back his recommendations up.  Frankly, I've found the improvement to be
substantial enough that I don't need the data.  The fan is especially
effective when you've got a lot of stuff in the compartment, but it even
helps when it's nearly empty.  Also helps provide more temperature
uniformity, another plus.  Sound engineering principles as well; convection
just doesn't move enough air for efficient energy transfer with such a
limited heat exchanger area.
