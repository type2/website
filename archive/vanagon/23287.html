Subject:  pilot bearing confusion

please pardon me for not having the bentley manual yet (trying to scrape
up the $$).  the recent discussion of the pilot bearing has left me
somewhat confused.  i have the haynes manual, and there is something
referred to on p.110 as the release bearing (which comes as part of the
clutch/pressure plate kit from the parts place).  no 'gland nut' is shown
as such.  i thought this 'release bearing' was the pilot bearing, but from
recent discussion, i am left with the impression that it is not.  on p. 43
there is a diagram which shows a needle bearing with the flywheel, but
no 'gland nut'.  i'm new to my vehicle and mechanical stuff in general, but
my intentions are noble (i really want to learn, half of the reason for
getting the one i did), so could someone please help me understand
what's what, so i can get my van on the road?  

very thankful for your kindness, 
matthew (81 adventurewagen)

p.s. - just to make sure it's not my hydraulic clutch system, what should
the travel be on the slave cylinder piston (about 1-2&quot;?)
