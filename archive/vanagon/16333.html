I suppose the first request for replies was a bit too cumbersome so how about
a stream-lined version.

RE: Head gasket problems on Waterboxers.

Just send your name, email address, vanagon year, mileage and whether
 1.  No leaks 
 2.  Leaks but not repaired
 3.  Leaks repaired but not reimbursed by VWOA
 4.  Leaks repaired and reimbursed (%) by VWOA

A mileage for whichever event(s) apply might help for the data base.

The text of the original request follows below:
I think there's benefit for all of us pumper-drivers to get this information
together and distributed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I volunteer to archive the composite tales of woe/terror/ripoff/etc regarding
head replacement, leaking seals, etc.

If we gather the info correctly we will have a strong case for presenting
VWOA with either a &quot;make it right via FTC&quot; or a potential Class Action lawsuit.

I will need:

1.  VIN of your vehicle.  Description EG: 1989 Vanagon Westfalia Syncro.

2.  Documentation reference for the problem: EG dealer receipts, repair
    histories, 8x10 color-glossy-photos of icky bluegreen vanagon blood on
    your parking spot or some such similar proof of defect.

3.  I need to know mileage:
    a.  When you first noticed the defect.
    b.  When you had it repaired if you did.
    c.  Present mileage on the VIN vehicle.

4.  Your name, net address and if you wish your papermail address and a
    telephone number.

5.  If you've had the defect repaired at your expense, I will need a doc-ref
    for a legitimate receipt as proof of expense.

6.  I will also need the dealer reference or repair shop reference where the
    problem was identified, worked on, or fixed.  Name, Location, Phone.


I intend to use the information to support my claim and I will provide the
analysis free of course to anyone on the list who would like it via a post
or inclusion into the FAQ.

I called vwoa and got a pleasant, well trained, phone screening person who
first denied the existence of the FTC issue, then begrudgingly sent me an
incomplete package of the filing/arbitration procedure and then adamantly told
me that &quot;these things do wear out, you know&quot; and &quot;with the mileage on your
vehicle we will not be able to provide any assistance&quot;.  Goatblather!

I subsequently got a nice &quot;sorry charlie&quot; letter from vwoa which I would be
happy to share.

My point is vwoa has obviously directed these folks to &quot;cut their losses&quot; by
discouraging action by owners.  I intend to overcome their resistance to aid
loyal customers by demanding they pay parts in full and labor at shop cost
to repair an obvious design flaw.

I could use your help and you if you like could use my results to help yourself
with the eventual head replacement on your 1.9 or 2.1 &quot;coolant leaker&quot;.

To aid my categorization of the replies PLEASE make the subject line &quot;FTC&quot;
and mail directly to me (copy the list if you like).  I use digest mode and
Lew Platt thinks I shouldn't be spending company time stripping info out of
personal mail.

Send Responses to &quot;alf_at_hpptc38.rose.hp_dot_com&quot;.  I'll acknowledge each reply.

TIA  alf (&quot;they all do that&quot; NOT!)
