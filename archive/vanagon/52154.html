WEll...


when the speedo in my 68 bug di that, it soon after broke my speedo 
cable! it was something inside trying to locktogether, and putting tomuch 
strain on the cable. My solution was to replace it..:) and since the 
odometer didnt work anyway ...

but, there are some speedo gurus out there who will be glad to volunteer 
info on how/when/where to rebuild it...:0
