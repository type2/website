The mid-atlantic trip to seneca, WVa sounds great.  i would
actually be interested in any trips around the region.  I am
located in Charlottesville,Va and am pretty much central to any
of the locations suggested thus far.  This wil be a perfect
time for a long road trip with my new (reman.) engine.  I have
spent the whole summer wishing my van ran well enough for a
vacation.  Hopefully i can squeeze one in and forget about
magnetic resonance for a while.
