Subject: Blinking Temperature Light

Out of the blue, on a cool morning, the temperature LED
starting blinking on our '85 Westy.  My wife pulled it
over, and called me at home.  Of course by the time
I got there, everything was normal.  No blinking light.
Water level was fine.  Belts were fine.  And the electric
fan was working.

I took it to Fred's Garage, since they were willing to
look at it to make sure a meltdown wasn't imminent.  They
said that the LED represents the water level... so it
can come on when the engine is cold.  They suspected
that the sensor had worked itself out of whatever it
sits in, since John was able to push it in a fraction
of an inch.  

So far everything has been fine since the original blinking
incident this morning.  Does anyone want to comment on
this?  I know I can't count on you all!
