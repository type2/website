Subject: Coolant sensor replacement

I have decided to replace the coolant sensor (Temperature sensor II
according to VW) on my 86 GL on the advice of several of you who suggested
that may fix some of my cold start problems.  I have the sensor ($9.80) but
have not installed it yet.  It doesn't have threads and appears to be held
in place by a clip.  Is it possible to switch from old to new sensor fast
enough to avoid spilling a lot of coolant, or is it necessary to drain the
coolant from the block first?  Is any form of sealant or O ring replacement
needed??  My Bentley manual doesn't seem to say anything about this
apparently minor repair.

Any sharing of experience would be appreciated.
