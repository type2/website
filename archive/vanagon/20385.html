Subject: Anyone have IVWA's schedule?

Does anybody have the remaining schedule for IVWA?  I know they have events
scheduled at the Winston/Salem, NC area.  I went to some of their events
several years ago when they were at Gainesville, FL and Commerce, GA.  I would
normally check in HVWs but I don't subscribe to it any more.

Are they going to be there any time later this year?

Thanks,

Jonathan
