]&gt;I'm told that the Vanagon bolt pattern is identical to Mercedes, and would

]&gt;details of this approach, as to offset, brake clearance, and what to use for
]&gt;lug nuts/bolts?

]luck. the mercedes wheels have it stamped on them.

]one article in an old issue of HOT VWs shows a fellow with a vanagon (turbo)
]and mercedes wheels (1983-style). the only thing 'bad' that i have heard about
]doing this is to be sure to use the mercedes nuts/lugs. it seems that the
]vw have round bottoms and the mercedes have square bottoms. and the wheels
]are set for that type of bottom. in other words, you shouldn't use vw nuts
]with mercedes wheels. (or vice versa)

But where do you get the hardware to regear the speedometer?
