My .02.  My 1970 Kombi smoked (or was smoked in, whichever) on startups,

for a minute or so before shutdown I never got the smoke.  No idle before 
shutdown, usually I'd see smoke.  

So this indeed would lend credence to the prevailing 
&quot;gas-in-the-cylinders-at-startup&quot; theory.  

Good luck (&amp; I hope the fix is cheap!)

&gt;      &gt; The 75 Bus makes a big puff of black smoke (almost?) every time I start 
&gt;      &gt; it. The smoke dissipates after a few seconds and then things seem fine. 
&gt;      &gt; Could it be worn rings? Can I afford to ignore the problem?

&gt;      I always thought that black smoke meant petrol, but if it is oil and 
&gt;      it doesn't get any worse then at least you have some oil in your 
&gt;      cylinders when it turns over first time in a morning - which under
&gt;      most cold start situations, has to be a bit better.
