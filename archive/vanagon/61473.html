Subject: Apology to all

Dear members--

I owe you all an apology. I accidentally forwarded a solicitous e-mail to the
list instead of my on-line service's Spam police. I swear this was a complete
accident and not an attempt at a joke or a would-be clever idea to push
peoples' buttons. (The e-mail was slugged FWD:Hi)

Members of the Vanagon List have been extremely helpful and generous to me in
solving some problems with my newly purchased  83 Westfalia--  And also in
forwarding tips, information, moral support, and suggestions to solve or
better understand the workings and quirks of my vehicle. I feel very
fortunate to be able to communicate with so many helpful, knowledgeable, and
generous people.

I promise I have no ties to the company and no interest in the company whose
Spam I mistakenly sent to the list. My on-line service (AOL) has an address
they recommend sending all Spam to in an effort to end this unwanted and
unsolicited mail. For some reason I don't understand I get tons of Spam from
all sorts of companies. I continue to forward it all to the address AOL has
recommended to block such e-mail. In my on-line address book the anti-Spam
address and the Vanagon List's address were next to eachother-- just one
click away. I have just eliminated this recipe for disaster.

I received several angry messages from members about the e-mail. Before I
realized they were sent to me personally I thought, &quot;This jerk is getting the
ear-full he deserves.&quot; Then my heart sank as I realized I was the this jerk.
I understand your anger. And I understand that the type of e-mail I forwarded
is very offensive to some. 

I honestly feel terribly guilty and embarassed for subjecting you all to this
e-mail and for upsetting many of you. I feel very fortunate to be a member of
the list and I beg you to accept my sincerest apology.

Jeff
