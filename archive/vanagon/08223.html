Subject: A wrecking yard in the Seattle area.

Just went to see what the Woodinville Auto auction was all about,
and saw a couple of neat things; a 1979 bug convertible, a 1974 Thing,
a couple of mid-70's bugs, and a 1976(?) westy to be sold this Saturday.
  Anyway, when I'm in a new place, I kinda like to cruise around and
see what all's there, and I stopped at a place called Gerry's foreign
auto parts, ltd. They had quite a few busses/bugs from all eras, including
a couple of vanagons (An `84, and a 8?), a `59 micro, a `62 single cab,
(Driver's rear all smashed. :( Or I might have considered it.) A relatively
complete 1976(?) westy, amoung other things. I guess I looked like a 
criminal, as they had to have someone escort me through, and I didn't
get that good of look at anything. Oh, also a `59 ghia, and a `61.
They seemed kind of pricey to me, but YMMV.
