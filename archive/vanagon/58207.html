Subject: Syncro Westie URL changed
Date: Wed, 9 Apr 1997 10:14:56 -0400

My ISP appears to have changed servers without telling the
customers, or at least this customer :-(.

The Syncro Westie pages, which for a variety of reasons also contain
some splittie pages, are now located at 
http://www.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm

Joel, Ron, Dave, and anyone else with links to it, please
update your pages accordingly.

Thanks,

Tom F.
