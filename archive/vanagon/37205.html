Okay, since this thread seems to be about where I need help I thought I
would tag along for the ride:

here is my dilemma:

I have a '68 Bus which I want to use the engine and part for my '69 Westy.
I have a stack of papers for both (titles, bills of sales, etc) Problem -

I can not register the '68 because it will not pass smog the DMV tells me I
can junk it but then I would have to surrender the title.  But what happens
if A) I want to put it back together or B) when I want to get rid of the
'remains'?  Also, the DMV tells me that I can not transfer title or
register the '69 because it has no engine.  I just want to little slips of
paper that have my name on them.

Can any one help me with what I can or can not do?

&gt;Hi Thom,
&gt;
&gt;I had do do this twice when I lived in California--once for a '54 BSA
&gt;motorcycle and once for a bug.  What I did was call the city police and
&gt;explain the situatiion (doesn't run, no tow bar, etc) to them and asked if
&gt;they would have an officer stop by for the vin verification.  Both times
&gt;they were very pleasant about it and came right away.   This was in San
&gt;Luis Obispo, where the police had little to do--Sacramento may be different
&gt;but it is worth a shot.
