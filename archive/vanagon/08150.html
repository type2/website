The fact that you have low compression on ALL four cylinders would lead me
to conclude that this is a mechanical/design fault rather than component
failure or wear. On a new engine break-in is crucial for proper ring
seating and this would be what i would look for first. There are a number
of simple ways to determine if either the rings or valves are bad -
any decent manual will describe the procedure. The fact that it is running
hot is indicative - does the oil light ever come on at idle or at low revs?

Anything below 100psi is supect with the average being around 120.....
The fact that they are within 10% of each other is good; is oil being
burnt or are you consuming oil (ie every fill up)? if not then feel confident
that you can run
this engine for a while- but first check out everything with gauges....DC
