Subject: Re: Getting bubbles out of cooling system

Hi.  How can you tell if there's air in the system?  In the last week, 
I've noticed that after I come to a stop when the engine's hot, I 
experience coolant loss - a puddle on the ground.  A couple of times it 
came from the area underneath the gas tank.  The last couple of times 
though, it appears to be coming from the master tank in the rear.  
By the way, I have an '87.

Also, before this started happening, I opened the cap on the master tank 
(not the refill tank) just slightly, and a little fluid came out of the 
top along with the sound of air being released.  Could I have let air in 
the system by doing this?

One more note, the coolant loss from the gas tank area happened at lower 
elevations, but the coolant loss from the master tank area only started 
in the mile high area of CO.

ANy ideas about this?  It's not a regular leak, and it doesn't happen 
every time I go for a drive.

Thanks,
david
