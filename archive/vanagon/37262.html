&gt;   have some reason for these failures? I am planing on using my Syncro
&gt;   for some real work: dragging junk car out of the woods, removing
&gt;   tree stumps, some towing of stuck cars. Am I looking for
&gt;   trouble??   TO all who have a Syncro- did your trans. require work??

And Dennis Haynes said, in his own concise way:

&gt;abuse.  As these vehicles are no longer available and there is nothing else
&gt;in it's class,  I feel that abusinsing them in this way is a pathetic act.
&gt; You should sell it to someone that will appreciate it and buy a rundown
&gt;jeep, blazer, or subarbun to do your dirty work.  These things will do that
&gt;work with liitle trouble and no one will care when it is destroyed.

I have to agree. Please don't do that to a Syncro. If you want a truck to
do this, you start with a boxed frame, a serious heavy-duty transfer case,
and differentials as big as your head.

The older International 4WD enclosed trucks are an excellent value and can
sometimes be had in serviceable shape for $1500 or so. Parts aren't easy to
find, but they're easier and cheaper than Syncro parts and you won't need
nearly so many of them.

If you like, I have a Jeep J-10 full-size pickup truck that is capable of
pulling a freight train out of a canyon; I'll trade you straight across for
the Syncro (if you haven't done the above to it yet).

If no, at least consider a winch. A decent one will drag four tons and that
way you won't rip the teeth right off your gears.
