&gt;Well, it's suppose to turn on the heater that is built in under &gt;there rear
&gt;bench seat.  You have a Westy or a bus?  It's just a heater core &gt;with a
&gt;blower built in it.  When you turn on the switch (3 speeds) it &gt;activates
&gt;the blower.  From what you've said, it sounds like the blower &gt;isn't
&gt;blowing.  I'd check the fuse first and then the switch.  I've had &gt;trouble
&gt;with the switch for the main heater and had to replace it.  &gt;Kinda of a
&gt;cheapo switch.  If that doesn't do it, you'll have to check other &gt;things
&gt;like the connections, the relay at the blower end.


Well Steve, it's an 82 Westfalia.  I've looked under the rear bench seat, and
didn't notice a heater type thing, but I wasn't looking for it either.  So
how does this thing work? Do you use it when you're parked up and trying to
heat the van while camping?  Or when you want to warm up the interior before
heading off for the day?  Where does the blower get the heat from if the
engine is cold?  I'm still confused.  Sorry!

Andy
