&gt; Ken, no not yet. I thought it might be a head gasket, but if so, I can't understand why 
it blows combustion gases into the coolant, causing it to overflow one time, then not do 
this for quite some time later? When this happened the last time it was rather cold out 
(in the 30's). The same thing happened this summer when it was warmer out?

I'm still perplexed. Right now it's behaving itself.
