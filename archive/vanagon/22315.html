Subject: Names for Vanagon-less persons (was: Introduction)



&gt;Lastly, we need a name for Vanagon enthusiasts.  People without a bus have 
a
&gt;name (Wanabus) so people with a van should certainly have a name.


How about... Vanawites?

Especially those who are simultaneously female, and game-show
enthusiasts?


Now THAT'S sexist... as well as lame.
