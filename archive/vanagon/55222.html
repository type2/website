Subject: new list member 86syncro

Hello, 

       My name is Derrek Wittmann.  A week or two ago I bought a 86 syncro GL 
poptop (non westy)with a bad motor. My intetion is to put a subaru 2.2L motor
in it.  Since then I have been trying to find out as much as I can about syncro
vanagons.  I was glad to find such a wealth of information in the lenti
archives. I tryed to read as much as I could of the last 3 years reguarding
syncros. I have had a few volkswagons and volvos in the past.  I have done all
of my own work on them. 
      Right now I am a student a Shoreline Community College in a year I hope
to be at Western Washington University in there Engineering Technology program.
If anyone has any questions feel free to email me.  Will post again when I have
to contribute.  Thanks for all the infomation so far.
