&gt;James,
&gt;I should probably clarify.  I have my 500s wired into the high beam
&gt;circuit so that they only come on when the high beams are on and they go
&gt;off when I turn the high beams off.  I don't use them when oncoming
&gt;traffic is around.

Well that's good, but even with high beams, there are always moments when
an oncomming car appears unexpectedly around a curve, or there can be times
when one is distracted and forgets to dim the lights.100s can really blind
you.  I've had this happen to me, and it's really dangerous, you've
probably had it happen to you.  I run the 500s on my westy too, but I can
rarely use them, there is too much traffic in the NE.  Their range is too
far,  and I have to dim them so much earlier than regulat high beams that I
end up using the low beams more than I would normally use them!

James
