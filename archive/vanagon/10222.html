Subject: Re: The case of the missing brake fluid.

Gerry: this is the way I was kind of thinking. I haven't ruled out a
leaking component in the brake system, but see no evidence at each wheel.
Closer inspection may reveal leakage in the connections (though not
likely). 

The other possibility as you say is that fluid is leaking into the clutch
itself. Is this at all possible? Is there any point at which fluid passes
into the transmission case?

Not sure about this. DC --
