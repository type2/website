Subject: Heat while camping??

All these heat threads have got me thinking about winter camping.  I seem 
to remember that someone suggested installing a propane furnace, like the 
ones that the new winnebago Eurovan campers use.  Has anyone tried this.  
Where would you mount it?  I'm thinking the bottom of the Westy closet in 
an '84 vanagon camper.  What about next to the water tank?  

My Camping world catalog list a furnace made by Suburban that is vented 
outside with the same vent that is used on the Eurovan camper.  

12,000 BUT furnace
12 V 2.8 Amps
9 3/8&quot; by 9 3/8&quot; by 21 1/8&quot;
$349

I'm also concerned about the propane and 12 volt use from running this 
thing overnight.  I would like to have some propane left over for hot 
coffee.  Does anybody know how much propane the Westy tank holds?  
Also, is 12,000 BTUs going to keep the van warm on a cold night?  

Thanks,

John Brown
