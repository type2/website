Subject: Re: Name That Brick

&gt;Actually I'm curious to see if I am the only one weird enough to have a 
&gt;name for my brick. 


Boy have you got a shock coming! Has anyone not named their bus?

Personal favorite, not my name BTW:
  
 &quot;Fast and BulBus&quot;,  (from a line in a Captain Beefheart song)
