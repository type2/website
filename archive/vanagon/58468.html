  to
  the side before cutting the new hole.  The hole needs to be finished

  with some sort of trim (sharp edges).  Then mount the new top.  I
  had
  this done on my van.....no welding required.  I am obvioulsy
  skipping
  some steps but you get the idea....

 What about the other areas that are cut out in the factory jobs,  I've
seen aftermarket conversions where they only cut out the sunroof area
and they looked ok.
