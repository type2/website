&gt; To any Canadian list members with a 1.9L Eco-diesel (or anyone else for
&gt; that matter),
&gt;    I understand that the 1.9L Eco-diesel turbo was primarily to clean up
&gt; exhaust, have any of you folks that have them bump up the boost for more
&gt; power? Any comments?

&gt; `82 Diesel Westy (soon to be 1.9L turbo, I hope)
&gt; `84 Turbo Diesel Jetta
&gt; 
If you mean the one used in Jetta/Golf prior to '93, my understanding 
is that it is a 1.6l, with a turbo, but no boost enrichment on the 
injection pump, and (I think) a cat converter. This is the engine 
listed as 59hp or so in the Bentley, vs 68hp for the standard TD 
(with boost enrichment).

I've run mine without the boost enrichment (by mistake) and it felt 
like there was nearly no boost at all.

I wouldn't want to increase boost much beyond the spec without an oil 
cooler and intercooler; my TD gets pretty hot when climbing hills - 
even 20w50 oil loses pressure pretty fast.
