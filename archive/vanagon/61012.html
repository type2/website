Subject: FS: Front Differential


	There is a junkyard near me that has a syncro and is selling the
front differential with the Viscous Coupling for $350.  I know that the
seals will eventually dry out if it sits too long so I thought that I
would post it's availability to the list.  Please EMail me if you are
interested.
