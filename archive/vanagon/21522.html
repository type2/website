Subject:      RE:  Full flow oil pump



Berge sells a pump plate cover for busses that allows for the lack of space.
It comes out at a sharper angle. Unless you are like me, still have that type
I in there with the adapter plate--dump long term plan, it should work.
(fortunately this is the Vanagon list, on vintagvw mention Berg, Muir, or
static timing and people freak out. This group is definitely much more
groovy--maybe to much so).
