Subject: Trade Westy tent for gas heater???


Okay-  I'm opening a can of worms a bit prematurely but I wish to see 
what is out there....

I am considering installing a gas heater in my '87 Westy but haven't
 quite decided if it is the route to go for supplemental winter
heat.  Much of my decision would be based upon finding the right
heater in excellent condition.  At this point I don't know which is
the &quot;right&quot; heater and could use some guidance/sales pitch on the 
various models out there.  

&quot;Excellent condition&quot; does not mean Good Condition in the tragic 
Hooverian sense but does mean 100% complete and working well.

So here's the possible deal... and I stress *possible* because I'm 
not convinced a gas heater is the way to go at this point.  I have 
the big, drive-a-way tent with floor; the blue+yellow/orange/white 
one.  It is missing the 3 corner &quot;Y&quot; poles which are hard to find.  
Alternate fabrications seem to be the best route for these.  There 
are some holes in the canvas from mouse chewings that I will fully 
describe to interested parties and send pictures of before the deal 
is done.  I don't think they are too bad but each person has a 
different view.  The screens are intact and the zippers work.  The 
grey rubber strip that hooks on the drip rail seems stiff.

I don't need a tent and want a heater (i think) so I'm thinking even 
up trade.  Everything is 'tent'-ative at this point  :)

Whaddya Got?

too thoroughly at the moment)
