&gt;Am I to conclude that Bus Boys and Bus Depot are but a change of name?

&gt;I just ordered some parts from a gentleman named Ron at Bus Depot.  He has
&gt;always been helpful with any questions I've had, whether he could sell me
&gt;the part or not.  I'll let you know how my experience goes.

Bus Boys and Bus Depot are two separate businesses, and a continent apart.
I've never heard any complaints about Bus Depot.  Quite the opposite.
