Subject: How I fixed my Fuel problem

Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions on how to fix my fuel pump
problem. I believe the problem is indeed lack of fuel tank venting. I
couldn't find any venting to unclogg, so I walked out of the shop this A.M.
with a cordless drill and a tiny drill bit and 'vented' the gas cap. It
doesn't seem to leak, and if this is a real faux pas, I'm only out a gas
cap.

Seems to drive just fine though. I'll be sure to let you all know if it
acts up again.

Thanks so much,
Ken
