Hello Dear VWers,

I have a general question about how the injectors get synchronized with
the sparks. If you start from the Hall generator, it doesn't have any
idea which cylinder it is generating the pulses for. Then it goes to the 
coil &amp; at the low tension side of the coil, there is no info about
the cyl #. So, then these pulses go to the fuel injector control unit,
and there the control unit has to fire up the injectors at the right
time. How does this get synchronized?

Regards,
Vahid
