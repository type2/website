Subject: Re: Vases for the Dash on Bus?


I've found these things are really expensive collectors' stuff--way over 
my price range.  But the idea of fresh flowers is very appealling, so in 
Mexico I took an old Coke can, cut the top off with my jack knife, and 
duct taped it to the dash board.  A bit of water, ripped out a few 
flowers from beside the highway, et viola!: blumevase!

The water did get a bit punky after a coupla weeks, so I had to re/re the 
can to dump out the water...   :/
