Subject: Re: Timing '72 with no vacuum



++        I am progressing on my '72 camper, but the distributor is a
++mechanical advance only Bosch (don't know what number).  What does anyone
++suggest the timing should be set at?  All the books say 5 degree ATDC - but
++this assumes there is a vacuum module attached. 

Muir suggests running the .009 (he doesn't specify which model, though 
mentions his '71) at 7.5 degrees Before TDC.

Type 4, should it be the same as type 1???
