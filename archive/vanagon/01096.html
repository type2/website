Subject:      heaters

this is what i have about gasoline heaters for buses. i can also send some
info about Webasto heaters, but when i checked on them, they were VERY
expensive (like $1400!!!). well, ok, so that included a thermostat. whoopeee.

i found out about Stewart-Warner and Webasto by going to the local truck stop
and checking out some of their trucking magazines. there are ads in them for
just such heaters, some of which have timer-options ... so it comes on at a
certain time and pre-heats the car. another option (for us water-coolers) is
to pre-heat the coolant. but like i said, expect to pay very large bucks.
