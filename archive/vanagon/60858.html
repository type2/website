Subject: LIST MUG UPDATE

 Howdy all. I got the plastic travel mugs in right before leaving for the
parkway, so I took the extras there, where they were snapped up pretty quickly.
Thanks to those that bought them. If you ordered JUST a #2 plastic travel mug,
and no other mugs, I'll be shipping those out this week. If you ordered one of
those, but ordered another design as well, please hang on. I'm waiting until I
get the others in so I can ship everything together...
  So, I have NO MORE MUG #2!
  That does leave me, however, with about 100 of the ceramic 4-bus list mugs,
which I shall be selling until those run out. After that, I will NOT be
printing mugs again for a very looooooonnnnnnnnggggg time. They have really
turned into a headache of delays and run-arounds, and as I'm not making too
much off these things, they are just too much trouble.
  However, I'll do more t-shirts in a month or so, as soon as all this has
cleared up, and the lists have gotten back settled down...
 I do have plenty of stickers left, so feel free to order a few!
Thanks a lot
:)
happy bussing
