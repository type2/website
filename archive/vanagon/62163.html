Subject: Finished the trans today...=)

Well today I went out and bough the redline....aghhh its 34.95 a gallon...now
thats alot......but its worth it......I drained the auto trans fluid that I
put in to clean out the gears.....the front diff. wasnt too bad...but my
tranny ..aghh yuck..now that was a different story....disgustingly dirty so
the auto trans fluid did the trick .....and I put in the Redline....with a
quart of mobil one synchetic gear oil cause I really didnt have the monty for
a whole nother gallon for one quart.....it says they mix fine...so its
good.....and once I was done I took it for a ride......wow what a difference
no lie it deifinitally did work.._dot_cause it shifts through the gears muchos
easier....so I would definitally reccomend this to anyone who tranny is a
little on the fritz or gets stuck sometimes....and Thanxs to the TIM who
showed me the way to cleaning out the tranny....my mechanics thought I was
crazy but hey it worked and im happy...oh by the way if your lookin for
redline you can get it at Agawam speedshop in Agawam mass....they have both
auto and manuel....happy travelin to all.....talk to ya in a month I leave
thurs.....oh and i put in castrol synthetic oil.....soothed out my engine
lots.....good stuff=).....bye all..
