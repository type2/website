Subject:      Re: HEAVY-DUTY shocks? 89 Syncro

I saw the posting from David Bartolini 8/26/97 and have some questions about
it.  He noted the style N shocks were for the 16&quot; Transporters.  We have an
89 Syncro with 14&quot; wheels, we're considering 15&quot; wheels, &amp; the heavy duty
springs, shocks that Peter Seikel sells.  Are there any modifications needed
to the drive shafts, CV joints, etc?   What will happen to our smooth riding
rig if we change all this? We're not sure how to purchase from Germany, are
there other sources?
