&gt;I mostly stay in the middle lane on a three-lane freeway unless I'm 
&gt;entering or exiting.

I don't understand why you would deliberately drive this way.  In
a steady flow of traffic, you're safest in one of the outer lanes.
In a slower-moving car, you're safest in the right lane (given the
choice of right-most or left-most).  I never have understood why
anyone would choose to drive in the center lane and allow themselves
to be passed on the right!

I personally always try to stay right except to pass.  It makes
sense--although occaisionally some idiot can't find a lane open and
decides to pass on the right shoulder.

One time a guy passed me on the left shoulder--not because he was
being a dick, but because it was raining so hard he couldn't see the
paint lines, and he didn't realize he wasn't in a lane!  Talk about
driving too fast for road conditions...
