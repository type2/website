&gt; Unbeknownst to us, what lurked at our campsite was a confederate army of  
&gt;Lousiana ants that saw their chance to attack some yankee tourists. While  
&gt;that night's sleep went well, in the morning as I began packing our  
&gt;makeshift awning I noticed a steady stream of ants climbing one of the  
&gt;awning poles, marching across the awning, and disappearing under the front  
&gt;door gasket. When I opened the front passenger door, to my horror, I saw the 
&gt;invasion was nearly complete! The whole underside of the front mat was  
&gt;infested with at least 4 regiments of the ant army and they were using the  
&gt;cover of the dark red carpet to move reserves up the lines toward the  
&gt;cooler. The carnage that followed is too horrific a story to tell--as I mercilessly 
&gt;crushed every soldier in sight. The remaining holdouts would get their 
&gt;revenge on me later, though. Somehow Lajiri went unscathed through the whole 
&gt;ordeal. The ants knew their real enemy and despite further extermination 
&gt;efforts I was left with battle scars from the renegade ants who attacked me 
&gt;later on our journey back through Alabama. Those Lousiana ants are tough 
&gt;cookies!  
 
Seems like the ants were just showing a little old fashioned southern 
hospitality, and were just paying a nice Sunday social visit.  
 
Thinks could have been worse, after all you might have been visited by some of 
the larger (read small dog) sized insects that inhabit that part of the world. 
The 'skeeters can get large enough to carry off small children, and as you move 
up the food chain it only gets worse............good thing you left before the 
reinforcements came. 
 
Loved your story - made me homesick (yes ants and all)
