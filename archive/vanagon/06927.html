Subject: RE: '81 Westfalia odometer

&gt;specifically re: sticking odometer.  If the speedometer is going ok, it is
&gt;not likely that the speedo drive is disconnected.  You will probably find
&gt;a little white gear in the odo drive is broken or loose on its shaft.  Espec-
&gt;ially in the loose on its shaft case, you may have luck fixing it.  Get some
&gt;coarse sandpaper and scrape the shaft to make scratches along it (not around
&gt;it).  Put a pinpoint of superglue on the shaft and reassemble.  You may also
&gt;want to consider leaving a piece out so the odo drive only turns the full odo,
&gt;not the trip.
&gt;
&gt;Noone I've talked to has had much luck in buying the little gear alone.
&gt;B.
&gt;PS for non-mind-readers: all above assumes that you have taken the instrument
&gt;pod out, taken the speedometer of it, and disassembled the speedometer on the
&gt;kitchen table.  Make notes as you go unless this is your &gt;3rd time doing it.

The speedometer does seem fine.  I think we will take your advice and try
to fix the thing ourselves.  If we can't do it we will try and scrounge a
new odometer from salvage and stick that one in there.  Hey! we can reduce
the milage on our vehicle overnight!

Thanks a lot for the advice!
