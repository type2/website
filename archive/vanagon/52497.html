     Finally now I have come upon enough time to get to work on 
rebuilding the 1.9 engine for my engineless 85.  Disassembly starts today.
     My plan is to go the whole nine yards, main, rod and cam bearings, 
pistons and cylinders, every gasket you could think of, oil pump etc.  I 
want this one to run for a good long time.
     My first question is this:  Where do I buy parts?  I've seen whole 
kits advertised in VW Trends by the likes of Fast German Auto and 
Recycled Parts Bugs Place has almost everything listed in their catalog.  
Who is reliable and what parts do I want or want to avoid?  (BTW I did 
try to call Kyle during a free moment this week, but I'll be damned if I 
could find a phone number on their web page!)
     Secondly, what information do I have do have in my hands before I 
order these parts.  I am supposing that there will be a cartain amount of 
crankshaft measuring, but is there anything out of the ordinary?
     Third, heads.  I am thinking of at least getting valve guides and 
seals, but I'll have to see them to see what they need.  Any 
recomendations of what to look for and/or what to do in case of dire 
circumstances would be appreicated.

      Finally, any random advice, horror stories or neat tricks would be 
appreciated.

      Thanks,

      Bob
      84GL, 85GL + loose engine.
