&gt;
&gt;Saw your note on the list.....
&gt;
&gt;&gt;A while back, I mentioned a leak in the passenger compartment heater of my 
&gt;&gt;'84 Vanagon (I think I mentioned it).  Anyway, this supplimental/auxiliary 
&gt;&gt;heat exchanger has a black plastic housing, and includes what appears to be 
&gt;&gt;a white plastic bleeder valve.  My leak is near this bleeder valve: it 
&gt;&gt;appears a PO tightened it too much and cracked the plastic housing.  Now if 
&gt;&gt;there is coolant flow to this heat exchanger, there is coolant leaking from 
&gt;&gt;it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My question: Will one of those leak-sealing wonder-additives plug this leak 
&gt;&gt;and allow me to use this heater?  Or should I just close off the flow of 
&gt;&gt;coolant to it and provide blankets for my passengers?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Replacements are probably more $ than I intend to invest.  Any other 
&gt;&gt;suggestions? 
&gt;
&gt;I had one of these leaks a few years back on my 86 GL.  Thought it was in
the housing, but it turned out that I only had cracked the threaded white
plastic plug by trying to tighten it too much. (I think the plug is far more
vulnerable than the housing.)  The VW replacement was not much---few
dollars.  I made a successful temporary fix with silicon sealant and a hose
clamp to hold the plug tightly in place while waiting for the replacement
part to arrive.  
&gt;
&gt;I would not try a sealer for this one.  It the plug is cracked, the coolant
system pressure could blow it sometime down the line.  I'm not certain
turning off the heater will help either...I think the on/off valve is
&quot;after&quot; the vent plug in the system in which case you still get the pressure
on the plug.  If it's the plug, springing for an original dealer ordered VW
part on this one is the only reasonable solution.  If the housing, I would
check the VW price and the junkyards.
&gt;
&gt;Incidentally, I have had other plastic parts in the colliong system either
give up or give as a result of my heavey handedness (overflow tank, sensor,
thermostat housing)  The VW prices on these items (at least) have not been
bad and resolve the problem.
