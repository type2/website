Subject: Re: 6v fuel gauge in 12v bu

                      RE&gt;&gt;6v fuel gauge in 12v bu                  8/30/95

Bradley - Unless (as in this case we know better) the gauge is a direct
mechanical device using no electricity) ALL gauges are either volt meters or
current meters.  Volt meters read the voltage  across a source, current meters
are in series with a load to measure the current through the load. 

The typical circuit for a fuel gauge is :
battery + terminal  -&gt; variable resistor actuated by float in tank -&gt; gauge -&gt;
ground (or equally valid, battery + terminal   -&gt;  gauge -&gt; variable resistor
-&gt; ground). 

In such a setup the gauge measures the current in the circuit through the
variable resistor in the gas tank.  Given that (for all practical purposes)
the voltage from the battery is constant, the current in the circuit varies
with the resistance in the sender ( in accordance with Ohm's law,  Volts =
amps times ohms).  This varying current is reflected in the deflection of the
gauge.

Therefore if the gauge and variable resistor remain original equipment (6
volt) and you double the battery voltage from 6 to 12 volts, the current in
the circuit will be 2X the current that you would have with a 6 volt battery
under the same circumstances (fuel level) .

The fact that your particular set up works does not mean that the above is
invalid.  Do you know for sure that your sender and gauge are the original 6
volt units and not replaced with 12 volt units by a PO because 6 volt
replacements were not available?  Maybe he lived with a gas gauge that read
LOW by half!
