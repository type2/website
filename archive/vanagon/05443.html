Subject: replaicing microbus floor

hi folks.  happy friday.

i'm contemplating having the floor of my '67 walkthrough replaced/reinforced.
does anyone have any experience with this?  when we were looking for a bus, we
saw a '65 with a reinforced floor that seemed very sturdy.

any comments?? has anyone done this? any idea what we can expect to pay for
something like this?

any insites would be helpful.

thanks...

johnny b.
