Subject: Rear Camber Adjust Q's '80
Date: 20 Jun 97 05:08:42 PDT

While adjusting the self-adjusting brake shoes on my '80 I saw the 
opportunity to attempt to adjust the rear camber.  According to 
Haynes &amp; Bentley the large bolt simply needs to be loosened, a 
screwprybardriver inserted to lever into another position and bolt 
tightened.  However, they don't take into account reality.

The reality is that the nut came loose easily enough (I've been 
Liquid Wrenching it occasionally just for this occasion).  Prying 
moved the inner side of the bolt only.  The head of the bolt didn't 
budge.  I was able to slightly rotate the head of the bolt, but I 
stopped as it appeared that it was tightly coupled with the rubber 
bushing and was torqueing it.  Hammering on the threaded side of the 
bolt (nut in proper protective position) didn't change things, and 
neither did hammering on the head of the bolt itself.  Afraid to really 
wail on the bolt head.  I was able to get the washer to move slightly 
(confession mode/  with vice grips /off).  But still no movement of 
bolt.  I did find a small rock under the washer in the bottom half of 
the inner slot, but no access to check outer.

Questions -
Is the outer half of the hanger slotted like the inner?  I can't 
verify as the washer is large and may be covering the entire slot 
like the inner one was.  (I suspect that it IS slotted)

Is the bolt supposed to be free to turn within the rubber bushing?
(I suspect that it should)

Now what should I do?  Any ideas?, and no I can't fit a 16lb sledge in 
there to *assist* on nudging on the threaded end of the bolt!
Hit it harder is in my vocabulary, but  . . . . . . . . . I wish it wasn't.
