&gt;another weirder answer to the missing brake fluid could be that the BRAKE
&gt;master is leaking into the booster, hence the dissapearing fluid.

yup. that would sure do it. if the seal between the master cylinder and the
vacuum assistor were leaking, the fluid would 'disappear'. only way to find
out would be to disconnect the big vacuum hose and see if it was wet with
brake fluid.

i've not heard of this on vanagons, but it does happen on the 71-79 buses.
