Subject: '90 Westy cushions - cleaning

Hi Everyone.  As we are getting the van ready ready for camping 
season, my wife asked if we should wash our top bunk cushions.  Since 
the inside of the cushions are lined with a foam-type material, I was 
wondering if washing would be wise.

Anybody ever done this before??  Or would a dry-chemical cleaner be a 
better choice?  Thanks for any input.

Harry.
