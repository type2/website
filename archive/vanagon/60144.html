Well, the deal went through ('87 GL) ... thanks, James.  It was quite 
an ordeal finding a notary on a Saturday night at 8PM.  After gassing 
up today it turns out the avg mileage including some cruising around 
town today was just over 22 mpg.  

The next trick is to find a place to replace the shaft oil seal.  
James gave me the part, but I need someone to do the work.

I'm also going to be looking for a new rear bumper in a junkyard, 
etc.  

Anyway, Kris and I are planning a getaway this weekend, which, of 
course, will include use of the Weekender bed.  :-)
