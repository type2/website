Oh no! I can't believe we are doing this  :-)!

Kenyon is considering various wheels and tires:

&gt;Michelin MXV4 radials : H 95 rated (snip)--or
&gt;Pirelle P4000 : H 93 rated (snip)
&gt;(snip): 205/65 HR15s Michelin Energy MXV4 radials : H 94 rated 

I want to focus here on the load ratings: the &quot;95&quot;, &quot;93&quot; and &quot;94&quot;
in the tire specs above.  On my '90 Syncro Westie, and on my buddy's
'90 Carat, the tire spec sticker in the front driver's door jamb
specifies a 
variety of tires, either with 6 or 8 plys, or reinforced with  with &quot;97&quot;
load ratings. 

I thought the factory sticker called out &quot;97&quot; as the minimum for tires
that carried load ratings (truck tires don't have these numbers, I
think) anything lower -like the ones Kenyon is looking at- does not
really have the load capacity for the vehicle. 

Am I wrong?
