&gt;Has anyone installed an AM/FM/SW radio in their van? Any recommendations 
&gt;regarding brands, models, antennas, etc?

I have a Philips DC-777 AM/FM/SW/Cassette radio.  They are no longer
available.  When it was installed, it was necessary to run two more
wires back to the rear speakers because the VW radio was grounded
differently.  The installer skillfully used the same ceiling route as
the other two wires that were already connected, other installers
might not care and will string wires back there under the floor.

I can't find the right antenna for the Philips since the standard mast
enters the base of the post at an angle and I'm not willing to stick
an ugly CB antenna on the top.  When camping, I often attach a reel-up
longwire antenna to the mast which improves SW reception quite a bit.
Once, in the dark I forgot to reel it up and drove off with it
dragging on the ground.

(I have the original VW Heidelberg (code-free)
cassette radio for sale for US$150.)
