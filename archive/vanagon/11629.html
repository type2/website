Subject: RE: Job interveiw

Although I've never been to a job interview in it, I've turned up for 
meetings at the Ford Research Centre in my bus. It sure stands out amongst 
the sea of new Fords out in the car park. I once turned up in an Innoccenti. 
This is a rare Italian Bertone bodied Mini. They were never imported to this 
country and I was betting with the engineers that they couldn't guess what 
it was. Apart from being unusual it looked awful; faded red paint, huge 
holes in the bodywork you could put your hand through, big dent in one door, 
rust all over, YUK!!. Fast, though. Suprisingly they extended my research 
funding for another two years, they must of thought I needed the money.
