Hi all,

I just joined the list few days ago.  I've been mulling over getting a late 
model Vanagon Westfalia for about three years now.  Last Friday on my way to 
a reggae concert, I saw what I thought was an '89 or '90 Westie at a local 
Nissan dealer.  Let's just say I've had trouble sleeping since I want in to 
the dealer and test drove it the following day.  I'm tired of being a 
Wannabus and I'm ready to make the plunge...

&gt;From what I can tell, it has been very well cared for.  It turned out to be 
an '89 4-speed.  Other than a very minimal amount surface rust in a couple 
of places (right taillight and along the very bottom of the sheet metal 
between the wheel wells, both sides) it looks new.  The insides of the wheel 
wells were still black with undercoating.  It handled beautifully when I 
test drove it.  The interior is immaculate and I can get full service 
records and even speak to the original owner if I want to.  They are asking 
$12,900 Canadian and since they know practically nothing about these 
vehicles, they are pretty flexible on that price (quote from the salesman). 
 Not sure how reasonable $12,900 is.  Comments?

I have two major concerns:

It doesn't have A/C which is something I really want.  I hoping I can find a 
VW dealer who can install air in it.  I'm in Waterloo, Ontario so if Owasco 
VW just outside of Toronto will install A/C, I'm in business.  Does anyone 
know if this is feasible and if so, the cost?

My second concern?  Well, although it handled beautifully and idled 
smoothly, it has 222,000 kms (133,000 miles) on it.  The sales droid spoke 
of &quot;engine work&quot; having been done recently (the service records will 
hopefully be more specific), but I wonder how much life is left in this 
engine.  I also wonder what other things are soon to be a problem on a 
Vanagon with this much on the odometer?

I appreciate any help you can give me: places to look for problems; 
questions to ask the original owner; things to be aware of when I do another 
test drive...

Rich
