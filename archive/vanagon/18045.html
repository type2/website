Subject: Wow...cosmic...Star Trek...Transporters...and NOW..


This is cosmic....

First we had the Geordie/Muir discussion...

then the revelation that both Star Trek and the people on this list
all have TRANSPORTERS...

but today...yes today we find out that Jim Kirk is going on
vacation...in his TRANSPORTER....wow...imagine...Captain Kirk
jumped into a timewarp just to go on vacation in a VW Van
with a bunch of kittens!! 

AAAAaaaaaarrrrrrgggggg....this IS too early....need coffee....
