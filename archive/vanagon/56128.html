Subject: Swivel seat sticker update.

Unfortunately, the guy has only 2 left available.He doesn't want to get
rid of the rest.The good news is that he checked and told me that the
sticker is still available through VW dealerships, for $3.30 ea. So I
guess I'll mail those two to the first two listees to answer my original
posting. Its a good thing the messages display date and time, so I don't
mess up... 
&quot;And the winners are...&quot;: Charles &quot;Luke&quot; Lukey and Sean Bartnik.I'll
email you to arrange delivery. To the rest, sorry it didn't work out.
You should be able to order it at your local dealership. 
Cris.
