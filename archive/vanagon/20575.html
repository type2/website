Subject: Rusty battery trays
Date: Tue, 11 Jul 1995 09:29:16 -0500 (CDT)

When I was wrestling with the bumper this weekend I found a lot 
of rust on the battery tray on my '71 bus.  It has big holes all the 
way through it.  One of the previous owners had laid a piece of sheet 
metal over the hole and put the battery in there.  I do not have the 
money to do a 'proper' fix.  I would like to replace the whole panel. 
I do have some of that POR-15 rust stopper stuff.  I do need to get 
this air tight or my new motor will suffer.  So, any ideas.  I was 
thinking I would remove the previous fix, clean up the rust as much as
possible and then apply the rust stuff to stop it there.  Then I am 
lost.  Can I lay in a new piece of sheet metal and seal the edges with 
some high temp silicone sealant or some such?  That is the first thing
that comes to mind.  Any other fixes for this?  Thanks, Jim
