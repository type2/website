Subject: Re: door lock springs for '71 bus

&gt;Owners of '71 busses take note. Many of you have probably already
&gt;discovered the secret of the little spring buried deep inside the
&gt;front-door lock mechanism that helps the lock control arm to rest in
&gt;the correct position. Here is what happens if the spring breaks:  You
&gt;lock the door with the key. Then you check the door to make sure that
&gt;it is locked by trying to open it with your finger.  You go away and
&gt;come back later. You then insert the key in the lock, but the lock
&gt;will not let your key turn to the unlock position, just to the lock
&gt;position. So you give up and use the sliding door. The front door is
&gt;now also very hard to unlock from the inside, but you can still do
&gt;it, but your wife can't.
&gt;
&gt;There are two solutions. (1) Lock the car with the key, but do NOT
&gt;check the door to see if it is really locked (just look through the
&gt;windshield at the inside door lock).  (2) Replace the broken spring.
&gt;
&gt;Tell me, does anybody know where to obtain a spring that will not
&gt;break? I have gotten them from wrecking yards, but they usually break
&gt;within a year. Then I have to pound on the door just above the latch
&gt;while wiggling the key to get the door to unlock from the outside.

This is not a 1971 unique problem.  My 1972 has the same thing.  It's the
drivers door on mine.  If there is a way, please post it.
