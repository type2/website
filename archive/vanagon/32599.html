Subject: re:ROUND GIZMO TO LEFT OF HEATER CONTROL

The Trim Shop (which, despite the name, specializes in selling stuff
for type 181 VW things) has a herd of accessories which plug in to
this silver socket.  They are in Phoenix, AZ, btw.

/martha rubin &lt;busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com&gt;
  '81 Westy (puke-eggnog-ivory) type 231 (?)
  '74 Thing/Acalpulco (even &quot;pukier&quot; camouflage) type 181
  '79 Bug 'vert (triple white) type 115
Still want a DC blender, coffee-grinder, and hot daily camp showers.
