The Inuvik Run -- Eagle Plains

July 30

2033, Tuesday 30 July 1996

At Eagle Plains.  It is raining.

Nine hours thirty minutes to make-good 271 miles.  One flat.  Very
tired.  Shoulder feels like a rotten tooth.

(After-trip comments:)

I didn't set up the computer when I arrived at Eagle Plains.  I don't
recall making the above log entry but there it is in the trip log where 
I record mileage and fuel consumption.  I'd been up until 0300 
the night before working on someone else's Volkswagen.

The owner, a young lady discovered in Dawson by other members of
the group and towed back to camp with tales of a VW guru who could
'fix anything' (!) had been waiting three weeks (THREE WEEKS!!) for
some Dawson twitt to get a valve cover gasket for her Type IV. 
When I heard that I whistled, clapped my hands, got everyone's
attention and shouted &quot;I'll pay twenty dollars gold for the first
Type IV valve cover gasket in my hand.&quot;  Jack Stafford slapped one
in my palm an instant ahead of three others, then waited
expectantly.

He's still waiting.  Jack will believe anything.

I cleaned the valve cover and glued the gasket to it but had to beg
help from Dennis to snap the bail into place.  (My shoulder was
really screwed up.)  But the real problem with the Waif's van was
the absolute lack of any engine compartment seal, plus an after-
market exhaust system smashed up against her body-work and engine-
tin that was guaranteed to fry any seal once it was installed.

Using some carpet padding provided by Eddie, I designed a jury-
rigged compartment seal and set the Waif to fabricating it, sewing
the foam padding together with a sail needle and Dacron thread. 

Using sheetmetal provided by Dennis, I bent-up a two-section heat
shield to protect the soon-to-be-installed carpet-padding
compartment seal.  After bending the body-work away from the
muffler, I installed the heat-shields using safety wire.  The Waif
has to make it as far as Vancouver.  The whole affair was a lash-
up, a make-do-with-what-you-got sorta fix.  It should get her home
but if she tries to go five miles farther the whole thing will
probably explode.

After writing my log entry for the previous day, but before the
Waif showed up with the crippled van, I worked on Sue Booth's
diesel Vanagon, which overheated climbing the big hill back of
Dawson with a load of sightseers onboard.  Her coolant recovery
tank is cracked and has been for sometime.  She has been getting
along with a duct-tape patch.  Now the patch had failed and she'd
blown some of her coolant overboard.  

By backing her bus up against mine I was able to plug my 12v
soldering iron into the high-amperage outlet I've installed in my
engine compartment, thus giving enough cord to reach Sue's coolant
tank.  After scraping the gunk out of the crack in the
polypropylene tank I welded the crack with the soldering iron. 
While this was going on the Waif showed up, her bus dribbling a
trail of oil.

The next morning the others packed up and took off for Inuvik but
Sue was worried about overheating.  There was a big bubble of air
in her coolant expansion tank.  I don't know anything about water-
cooled Volkswagens but it was pretty obvious hers wasn't pumping
much coolant.  Parking her bus ass-first down the side of one of
the built-up camping pads, we got the radiator high enough above
the engine to coax the bubble up the pipe.  The radiator is fitted
with a valve -- a 13mm bolt -- allowing you to purge air from the
system.  When the engine got hot and the bubble vanished up the
inclined pipes, I loosened the bolt and was rewarded by a hiss of
air followed by a dribble of fluid.  Bubble-free, temp in the
green, we repacked the tools and headed for the Dempster.

The others were waiting for us in the restaurant where the Dempster
joins the Klondike Highway.  While they finished their coffee I
covered the lenses of my headlights with clear wrapping tape.  

Sue wanted to film the crossing the bridge over the Klondike River
so she went on ahead.  A road grader was smearing a
topping-coat of dirt &amp; gravel over the unpaved road and there was
a high berm of the stuff down the middle.  Sue positioned her van
on the left side of the berm so the others would have a clear path
and got her camera(s) ready.  The vans lined up and at her signal,
proceeded across the bridge.  I waited for them to get clear then
waved Sue to get in front of me, taking up the Tail End Charlie
slot.  

When Sue crossed the berm it snapped her wheels full-lock and shot
her toward the right shoulder.  She over-corrected, swerved back
too far and hit the berm again going the opposite direction.  When
her front wheels hit the berm the second time the soft dirt nailed
the front end.  She was still driving it, still trying to steer
into the skid when the rear end broke loose, slinging the van dead
across the road.   The blue Vanagon shot off the left slide of the
road, down the embankment and hit a tree.

I have a neat mental image of a blue van in mid-air, front wheels
locked, motionless, dirt streaming from them.  The rear wheels are
a blur.  There is a good three feet of daylight under the front
wheels.
  
Amazingly, there was no major damage and aside from bruises, Sue
was uninjured.  After the usual Chinese Fire Drill we got her back
on the road and underway.  

The trekkies, already down the road and out of sight when she ran
off the road, said I broadcast a play-by-play account of the event
as it happened in a slightly bored Joe Friday monotone.  I guess I
did since they all heard me doing it but I don't recall doing it. 
I only got about three hours of sleep the night before.  I spent
the day pretty much on autopilot.

The Dempster climbs out of the watershed of the Klondike, through
the Oglive Mountains and down into the watershed of the Peel. 
Eagle Plains is a high plateau between the Peel and the Eagle
Rivers, high enough to put you into the cloud base.

Climbing up to the pass thru the Oglive Mountains, another of the
watercooled vans needed some repairs to their expansion tank.  I
did the same butt-to-butt trick in order to use the soldering iron. 
The air temperature was above freezing but not by much.  It took a long
time for the soldering iron to get hot enough to melt plastic. 
Since the engine compartment of the watercooled veedub was buried,
and since the cargo space was filled, we transferred the weather-
tight part of that van's cargo to my roof rack.  If we had to work
on the tank again it would make things easier to get at.

As before, the faster vehicles whizzed on down the road leaving Sue
and me to set our own pace.  While negotiating an uphill curve, with a
vehicle off to the right with a blown tire and an RV coming toward
me, a small white sedan approached from
astern and made an aggressive lunge toward my rear bumper.  I
ignored him, there was no room for him to pass, the Dempster is
really only 1-1/2 lanes wide.  But as I pulled over to make room
for the on-coming RV the little sedan darted out to pass, forcing 
both the RV and me to lurch toward the shoulder.  

The driver of the little car could not have misunderstood my move
as an invitation to pass since the RV was right there and coming
downhill to boot.  And unless things have changed since the age of
steam, downhill traffic always has the right of way.  But not
today.  

The little car was chock full of people, their bodies rocking in
unison as the vehicle dodged the RV and accelerated away in a
skidding swerve, peppering my windscreen with a rooster-tail of
gravel.

The driver of the RV stabbed his brakes, locked-up the wheels,
drifting toward me in a slight skid.  There's no such thing as
'flooring' a 1965 Microbus.  I did what I could, managing to keep
it on the road and miss the RV, who got things straightened out
coming to a stop behind me as I continued up the grade.  I grabbed
the mike and warned the vans ahead they were about to be overtaken
by 'An insane family in a white sedan' as the little car flew out
of sight at a truly insane rate of speed.  It was spinning its
wheels, accelerating uphill, throwing so much gravel it formed a
hazy cloud behind the car. 

The Blackstone and Oglive rivers are major tributaries of the Peel. 
The Dempster must cross them.  Shortly after reaching the Oglive
River I saw the little white sedan again, spun off the road in a
marsh on the right.  Others of the group had already stopped to
help.  Eddie went back south, to where a road maintenance worker
had parked his 4WD Dodge to see about a tow.  Jack Stafford raised
the local highway maintenance division on CB9.  I waded into the
marsh to assess the damage.  

There were no injuries, other than from the clouds of mosquitos
rising up from the marsh.  The right front tire was blown, the
wheel mangled, either because of the wreck or the cause of it.  The
steering was hung up on a rock, the tie-rods bent.  As I hunkered
in the marsh to inspect the damaged wheel I saw a rainbow of
oil seeping from under the engine.  It was a deader.
  
The car was a rental out of Whitehorse, the Insane Family a gaggle
of Korean tourists intent on driving the 1,232 kilometers to Inuvik
in a single day.  They'd made it about half way.  They were still
alive but didn't seem to notice it was purely by luck.  I offered 
mosquito repellent.  They already had some.  I offered blankets.  
They didn't want them. I shrugged and climbed back in the bus.  
There was nothing else we could do since there is no way to 
loan common sense.  (On our return from Inuvik the little white 
sedan was still there.)

Shortly after passing the Insane Family the group pulled off at a
rest stop.  When I arrived someone pointed to my right front tire. 
I had a flat, or nearly so.  I dug out the jack and slapped on one
of the spares.  The group began pulling out before I had the wheel
changed.

Climbing onto the plateau between the Peel and Eagle rivers we ran
into rain and then hail then more rain.  I came upon a small red
car canted off the left shoulder.  I stopped to see if everything
was alright.  It was a young German couple, taking pictures of
handfuls of hailstones, some more than half an inch in diameter. 
Using their camera, I took their picture offering mounds of marble-
sized hailstones to the lens.  

As I climbed higher up the plateau and encountered more rain the
condition of the road deteriorated from merely sloppy to nearly
impassible, chewed into a quagmire.  I caught up to some of the
group who had came upon a motorcyclist, down in the road.  I
stopped on the height of ground in the middle of the road, praying
no big-rig was heading north.  Others in the group got the biker up
and remounted.  He lurched past me using his boots as outriggers,
skimming thru the mud.  He went down again as he reached the grade
but caught the bike before it went over, gunned it and leaped on,
wobbling wildly.  It looked as if he'd busted his clutch lever, or
bent it back, the engine revving furiously as he tried to shift. 
He was all over the road and I waited for him, giving him a
stationary target to miss.  He made the crest and kept on south. 
I shut off my flashers and kept on north.  The rest of the group
was already out of sight.

As I slithered and slewed down the grades a red 4WD pickup with
Alaskan plates came up behind and attempted to pass.  I could
barely control the bus, at times sliding as much as three-quarter
broad-side.  The Alaskan pickup seemed to think I was having fun,
pulled up alongside and wanted to play.  When he realized I was
fighting the wheel, that the bus was going wherever it damn well
pleased, he floored it.  He was in four-wheel drive trying to power
out of a skid of his own, swerving across my path.  His spinning
front wheels plastering my windscreen with mud, blocking all
forward vision.

During the last moments of landing a DC-3 you have no forward
vision.  As the tail settles, you're flying blind, unable to see
over the nose.  So you look out to the side, judging your path
relative to the edge of the field.  It's only for a moment,
probably ten seconds or so, and only scary at night, coming in to
an unfamiliar field.  I flew the old bus blind for over a minute as
the wiper and rain slowly sloshed the windscreen clear, the washer
having packed up somewhere between Frenchman's Lake and Dawson.

I caught up to Sue on the last slope coming into Eagle Plains.  Her
bus has a five speed tranny and can climb a telephone pole in low. 
She was plowing thru the mud like a tractor, steady, slow and sure. 
I planted the old bus in her ruts and let her lead me home.

I was dead tired.  I wedged the bus in alongside someone else and
sat listening to the rain on the roof.  I had a flat to fix and was
carrying someone else's baggage and needed a bath and a meal and I
could barely lift my right arm. 

For me, the run from Dawson to Eagle Plains had been the hardest
day of the trip. - rsh
