Subject: Re: vanagon oil warning system

My '84 vanagon oil light started flashing after an oil change to 10W40
oil just before Thanksgiving.  Somehow I put to much oil in it.  Thinking
that wasn't the problem I hunted around a found my oil pressure sender
was leaking alittle.  I replaced the sender and topped the oil properly
and the flahing light went away.  I think the sender was $9 at the dealer.
Removing the couling around the push rod tubes was more painful than it
should have been.  I wish they wouldn't use exhaust studs as mounting
points for these things...
