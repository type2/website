Hi all

For those of you who can't get your vintage manual from VW, try
Schiff European Automotive Literature, 401.453.5370.  They set
me up for my '60 Bug and '72 KG; my '77 Westy had the owner's
manual and Campmobile supplement already.

Just ordered my Bentleys for the KG and Westy today, thanks to
the folks on the list who brought it up &amp; inspired me to get off
my duff.  Now that I have a propane tank and gas heater coming,
I can get all setup for some proper adventure in the camper -
need to rewire the dual-battery setup and all!

	TTFN
