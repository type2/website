&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think people are making a mistake here.  It is 180 degrees on the crank and 
&gt;&gt;90 degrees on the distributor.  Direction of rotation is unimportant.  Also the cam
&gt;&gt;lobes have a constant radius over their back end (away from the raised part of the 
&gt;&gt;lobe used to actuate the valve).  This means that the valve lash reading will be constant
&gt;&gt;for about 90 degrees either side of TDC (crank rotation) for the cylinder being adjusted.

You are right that it is 180 degrees on the pulley and 90 degrees on the 
distributor. But the direction of rotation is important. Beginning with
#1 valves, to get to the #2 you have to turn the pulley 180 deg counter-
clockwise. If you turn it clockwise and adjust #2 you are making a mistake.
If you turn the ignition, you will hear your pistons banging on valves,
and say goodbye to your engine. After adjusting #2 turn 180 deg counter-
clockwise again to get to #3 , another 180 deg for #4...
