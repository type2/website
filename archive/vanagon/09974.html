Subject: Re: Sink pumps

&lt;slash&gt;

&gt;place, and it worked good for a while, but if it sits unused for any
&gt;length of time, then all the water drains out, and it takes a lot of
&gt;effort to get it primed again.  One solution to this (which I haven't
&gt;tried yet) is to get a small in-line check valve (again from the local
&gt;RV supply) so the water doesn't drain out.
&gt;


To get over this incredibly easily, take the filler cap off, take a deep 
breath, pucker up and blow into the tank. The water will rise obediently to 
the pump, which you can then use like normal. tim (iron lung) s.
