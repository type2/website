Subject: Re: Leaking gas tank overflow vents on a '90 GL? Read on...

Ive found that the small 5mm hoses that run to the vent tanks dry out and
crack and then you have an on again/off again leak situation in whu\ich you
may never see the spilled gas. The only proper way to correct this is to drop
the tank(5 minute job on a lift....) and replace all 8 small 4in long hoses
and replace all small crush clamps with oem vw parts. Voila the smell is
gone.Ed
