So Your PC Solution says:

&gt; &gt;So, of course, your welcome.  Maybe we can help ya with some advice and
&gt; &gt;such.  So get your butt down there and have a good time!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; So what is this event?
&gt;

Dear John,

(Well....it had to be said.  ;p   )

Anyway, the suthin' Californians/Arizonians/Nevada-ins?  Are planning a
gathering at Red Rock (State Park??).  I'm not sure of the date.  David?
Martha?  It's just a bunch of us VW Type II nerds getting together for
a campout and what-have-you.  I don't know that there are any scheduled
events except for Davids ugliest Type II contest (pre-rigged of course ;) )
Anyway, this will be the second of what I hope are many gatherings like
this.  Any demonstrations of technical/mechanical know-how will be ad-hoc
for now.  If yer interested, I think David Schwarze and Martha Rubin are
the ones kinda coordinating this particular event.
