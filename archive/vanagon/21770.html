Bill,

The unit that I have decided to install is a 1&quot; receiver type (square box
that allows the trailer ball drawbar attachment to be removed and installed
readily with removal of a pin). The Installed price with light's wired is $
170.00 (no sales tax in NH).  

Hope this helps?

Is your MV a weekender (Westy) ?
