Subject: RE: coil over springs for busses with sagging rear ends?

Steve, all,
	Coil overs are useful in the front.  Not ideal, but they will give 
you an inch or so.  Just adjust the rear.  It's not that hard and with IRS 
make sure to mark the spring plate holes.  Maybe get the rear aligned 
after the spring plate adjustment.  I've never bothered with non-IRS 
spring plates.  Ride over those bumps!  Gary Gibson
