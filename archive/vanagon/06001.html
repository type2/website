Well, I normally stay logged into IRC all the time in the background.  
So, I'll be there.  I set it to ring me when people join that channel.
I'm not always actually there, but give me a few minutes to respond.

And while someone noted that IRC is case-insensetive, the name used to 
create the group retains the case used.  So I used #VW, but you can join 
#vw also.
