Subject: westy table query


I may need another table and supporting post for my vanagon westy.  I
have an '81, but suspect that the size for these is standard for
all the vanagon westfalias.  Does anyone out there have an extra
they want to sell, and if so, is it for the back or the front table?
Depending on what I'm able to fix, I may be interested in each
item separately, as I suspect my problem is a back post paired
to a front table, or vice-versa.  Any extra or duplicate or unwanted
parts for such out there?
