 Chris,
    Almost forgot, as far as third party RAM/Cache chips, we use
www.kingston_dot_com All their chips have a lifetime warranty, every cell on
every chip is tested before shipping, and they are a certified by the
respective vendor. Commonly 50-60% off the OEM too. You can look up the part
you need on the web. If it's not listed, it's an OEM part only. If I was in
CA, I would provide the labor (free)  for the list as I am a certified tech.
Besides, it's not a hard job to do, just be very careful of static shock
(touch the case frame to ground yourself before touching any of the
electrical parts inside). I imagine that the dual pentium  cache may be OEM.
In the early &quot;dual&quot; pentium  systems, they did a lot of experimenting with
different cache configuations. Some had a  cache for each processor, some
had a &quot;shared&quot; cache.

Hope this helps,
Randy Newell
