Subject: Re: Should I Buy

     I found a 1993 Blue Eurovan GL, pretty nice shape, 30,000 miles, auto 
     trans, one sliding windows.  They want, $15,800, should I finance my
life 
     away and get this thing.

Tracey, that might be about going rate for these things.  The local VW guys
down the street in Tonawanda, NY have a 1993 EV CL, auto, double A/C, a few
niceities but reasonably stripped down and I believe they are asking $14,900.
 It also has 30,000 miles on it and looks in decent shape.  I stuck my head
into it, poked around a while, and found a very nice van.......but it sure
wasn't a Bus.  BTW, they've had this EV on there lot for I would guess 6
months to a year.......at this point they'd probably pay someone to get it
the hell outta there!

Just my $0.02...........
