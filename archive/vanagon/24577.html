Subject: Need a speedometer

This is for all of you that frequent the junk yards. I need a
new odometer/speedometer cluster for my '81 Vanagon. The speedo
works, but the odometer/tripometer is dead. Sure would like to
have an odometer/tripometer again, especially since my gas gauge
is flaky, and I was using the tripometer to keep track of when to
fill up the van. The only one I could find near Cleveland was
$250, which sounded high to me. Could one of you guys fix me up
with one? How much would it cost? Any help would be appreciated

Lisa
