&gt; &gt; 	Are 914 &quot;Porsche&quot; heads really different? I thought
&gt; &gt; it was a straight type 4, in 1.7, 1.8 or 2.0 litre form.
&gt; &gt; I've heard rumors that the cam was different, but I find
&gt; &gt; that somewhat hard to believe. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the Porsche heads are different, at least in some cases.
&gt; 
  I found some info in a Chilton's manual last night. Valve sizes in 1.7 and
  1.8 liter engines appear to match between bus and U.S. spec 914. The 2.0
  liter engine for the 914/4 and the 912E are different than the bus 2.0. It's
  not that simple though. Valve clearances for the 1.7 and 1.8 liter 914 are
  .006&quot; for both valves, implying solid valves (Sodium cooled valves are set
  at 008&quot; clearance, right?). The 2.0 liter 914 and 912E have clearance specs.
  of .006&quot; intake and .008&quot; exhaust, implying sodium cooled valves. The 2.0
  bus engine spec. is for .006&quot; for both intake and exhaust. So there you have
  it, more confusion than ever.


&gt; I agree completely, except that they are getting extremely hard to find
&gt; and are very expensive.  I paid $26 each for four of them for my bus, and
&gt; that was 4 years ago.  My friend just rebuilt his 914 and the sodium-
&gt; filled valves for his heads were $80 each.  These are the fat-stemmed
&gt; ones I mentioned earlier.  I guess they have a lot more sodium in them or
&gt; something.  They are considerably thicker, I would estimate on the order
&gt; of 5 mm thicker than the ones in my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; 
  The Porsche parts catalog that I have (Performance something of other) has
  sodium cooled valve in the 1.8 liter diameter only for $49.50 each.

  Overheatedly yours and about .008&quot; away from a self-inflicted lobotomy,
