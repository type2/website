&gt; This morning while donning a freshly laundered pair of levis I noticed that
&gt; they fit -- no belt required.  During the Grendel Episode I lost so much
&gt; weight I had to move my belt over four holes.  Since then my levis have had
&gt; plenty of room around the waist.  

Where can _I_ get a Grendel?
