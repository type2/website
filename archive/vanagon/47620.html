&gt;I'd like to know if the vehicle being converted is a
&gt;Westfalia camper. Sounds like the place where the propane tank
&gt;is located on US Westies. So they have the exhaust system
&gt;running forward?

All Westies I know have that propane tank on that place. Those owners may 
forget the AUDI engine swap. The shipped exhaust system goes straight to 
this place into the muffler and outlet ist in front of the rear left wheel. 
My own solution uses the original first exhaust pipe, ending 10 cm in front 
of the gear box, exact in the middle of the Vanagon. Nothing for Syncro 
owners, also other  Westy owners shouldn't do that. The first muffler will 
have a very high temperature, and that beside the propane tank. If you have 
a good isolation for the tank, do it on your own risk.

My camper have a 50L water reservoir on the left side and the same on the 
right for dirty water. The propane tank is inside the camper, left of the 
rear seats. I have had some problems with the shift shaft and the 
heater/cooling pipes, but now the exhaust system is ready to be mounted.

Westy owners should risk one eye on the Ford swap. Two or three muffler will 
be used, one each left and right beside the engine and optional one on the 
Vanagons original place.
