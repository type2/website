Subject: AC - To junk or not to junk
Date: Tue, 12 Aug 1997 10:03:46 -0700

Hello all. I have an '85 Westie with the original AC installed. The AC
does not get cool any more and I am considering pulling the whole thing
out to recover the storage space. I live in Seattle and rarely need AC.
Also, with my automatic, I can't imagine robbing any engine power to run
the AC -- it is too slow as it is. Questions:

1) Are AC units cheap to fix?
2) Would it damage anything to remove the unit (carefully)?
3) Would anyone be interested in purchasing/inheriting the unit if I
take it out?

Thanks.

Scott Semyan
