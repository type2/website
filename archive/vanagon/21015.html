&gt; Upon further reading of Muir they have update in the Changes and New

&gt; couple of bolts holding the tranny to the frame or something.  I 
&gt; wasn't actually out there so I couldn't look.  So, what is the 
&gt; netwisdon on this one?  Did I just waste $13 on that nifty strap?

Heck, the only thing holding up the rear of the trans (FIF) are the CV 
joints, in my '70.  When I first installed a motor, no problema.  But I 
looked at those beat CV boots and wondered, &quot;is the stress on the CVs too 
great?&quot;

So I've been strapping it on (er, _up_) ever since and liking it.  ;-)
