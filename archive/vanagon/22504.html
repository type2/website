Subject: RE: WTB: 2/3 front bench seat for 71 Bus


&gt;???... a 2/3 front seat in a walk-thru?
&gt;........
&gt; -Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '71 VW Transporter, non-walkthru(!)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;P.S. No, my front seats aren't for sale. I was just curious what
&gt;you meant.  :)


Most all non walk-thru buses you will see have the steel wall behind the
seat--that wall defines it as a non walk-thu!  But, you could convert a
walk-thru bus to a &quot;pseudo-non walk-thru&quot; by using adapter brackets to mount
a 2/3 front seat.  This adapter I believe was an original equipment
conversion  although few buses seem to have it.  

The walk-thru is great for camping and the summertime, but in the winter
I'll be partitioning the area behind cab seats with some plexiglass I picked
up for cheap and ducting my heater to the cab area.  The 2/3 seat will
provide the extra passenger space I need and I won't have to heat up the
entire bus when it's 10 deg F!!

Unfortunately where I live (Connecticut) there aren't a whole lot of
junkyard resources for old (older than 10yrs) cars--buses especially.  I
might end up with a customized Mopar/Ford/Chevy front seat--but then, will
the list still have me??? ;)
