Its been a while since I have posted to the list. Canada has been going
through  a major upheaval if you hadn't already noticed.

Anyway the Vanagon's right rear tire is out of commission.; completely
flat as a result of a large piece of glass (from a broken beer bottle
smashed in the ditch - following a NO rally). Actually the shard prevented the
tire from leaking,
initially but when I tried to get the van  home, the tire went completely
flat. The CAA was called and got us home.

So until I can find time to get the nuts off (all frozen save one). The
van sits in the parking lot and Martine and I use the bike to get around.

Later - DC
