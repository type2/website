Subject: 6-2-12: flywheel, bell housing


I'm ordering a new engine this week, but one little wrench in the
works.

Upon pulling my engine last night (my first solo engine-pull) and counting
flywheel teeth (110) I am now pretty sure that I have a 6v starter.

The conversion books I read stated that I need a 12v starter, and I must
enlarge the bell housing 1/10&quot;.  What the books don't say is WHERE the bell 
housing must be enlarged. Anyone done this before?

A local mechanic suggested taking a scrap shortblock, attaching the air drill 
to the crank, and using that to grind the bell housing, finishing with a hand 
file or drill with appropriate attachment.  Dunno 'bout that.

The bus is a '66.

Thanks for any help,
...Markus
