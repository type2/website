&gt;Question: at 150,000+ miles (and I don't know of any rebuild history), 
&gt;should I do preventative maintenance and replace the gaskets, or do it when 
&gt;they go bad (ie, is there a warning before the whole engine is toast)?

Michael,
I'd advise to just wait until it leaks.  Even then the head gasket leak
doesn't make the &quot;whole engine toast&quot; - just replacing the heads and gaskets
will cure the leak.  However with over 150,000 miles you MAY want to opt to
invest in a replacement engine instead of adding new heads to an old engine.
 You COULD do the heads and then have more serious trouble soon after.
