Subject: Bosch .009 28 ATDC _at_ Idle

I discovered an interesting thing about my $50 engine this weekend.

I've been having incredible difficulty getting this recent top-end 
rebuild to run right. I'd adjusted points three times, adjusted valves 
three times, and finally I rebuilt the carburator in an effort to just 
get it to run down the road and back without &quot;lugging.&quot; No luck.

I was able to set the idle and it seemed to run fine...but when I reved 
it up, I'd see backfiring and could feel a power lag as I drove down the 
road.

Then yesterday afternoon I called a friend, worried that maybe the guys
who reworked my heads left me with a sticking valve. &quot;Usually,&quot; he said,
&quot;backfire is related to timing.&quot; Then he told me how he'd once put the
distributor shaft in a little off in his girlfriend's bug and had to
compensate by timing way out. (He always does this by ear, so he couldn't
tell me how far out it was.) Guess what? I went out and turned my
distributor way out...like 28 degrees ATDC at idle, jumped in and ran down
the street. No backfire; only slight power lug. This was about 11:00 and I
live in a neighborhood, so I had to wait til today to really tweek it. 

So this morning I drove about 20 miles, stopping every now and then to 
turn the distributor just a little, in search of the sweet spot where 
there was no loss in power, no backfire. She's running fine now, though 
she did tease me a little when I stopped by the same friend's house; a 
bad connection at the solenoid kept me guessing for a few minutes. A 
jiggle, a twist of the key, and &quot;Hio Silver, away...&quot; Guess it was good 
karma, though. While I was down there, I realized that I had forgotten to 
tighten the nuts holding the engine to the bottom of the 
transmission...and one had fallen off. Yikes! Got that fixed now.

I don't have a temperature guage--yet--but I can tell she's not running hot.

I guess the moral of this story is...when you buy an engine for $50, 
expect to invest a lot of time to get it right...and expect the unexpected.

On the bright side of things, I can probably boast the highest timing of 
anyone on the list...without actually frying my engine. 8) On the 
downside, there's actually no way for me to find TDC...at least no way I 
know of.

If anyone knows of any hazards inherent in this situation, please let me
know. I'm planning on purchasing and installing a temperature gauge and
painting a white mark on the distributor/shaft as a reference point to use
in future tune-ups. Other than that, I'm just hoping to enjoy the bus for 
a while now.

Feels nice to be driving the bus again....feels really nice!

8) Joe
