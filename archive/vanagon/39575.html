Subject: Looking for EGR parts
Date: Thu, 11 Apr 96 11:44:47 PDT

I have an 80 vanagon from which a previous owner removed the EGR system.
I would like to restore EGR because, thanks to this group of vanophiles, I 
now realize that my engine will run cooler and last longer with a fully
functioning EGR system. It will also help me stay out of trouble with the 
EPA (Spokane,WA is on the EPA's list of worst cities and the emissions
inspections grow more rigorous every year). 

The problem is that most of the EGR components are no longer available.  I am
on shaky ground here because I have never seen the EGR system, but I believe I
need to obtain:
-EGR control valve
-EGR filter
-small exhaust tube which connects the control valve to the filter
-linkage rod between control valve and throttle
-gaskets

The dealer can provide the filter ($$) and linkage rod, but not the control
valve or exhaust tube, and I didn't ask about the gaskets.

Help!  Where can I get a control valve?  I think the valve is the most critical
component.  I MIGHT  be able to get the exhaust tube fabricated by a good 
muffler shop.  And I can buy the filter.  But I would rather find the filter 
and tube out of a junkyard or other source. 

Does anyone know of a good junkyard to try?
Does anyone know of someone parting out an aircooled vanagon? 
Other possible sources?
