Subject: Tightening heads

I'm still planning my repair strategy.  I have heard that tightening the
heads will sometimes work when an engine is blowing exhaust into the
cooling system.  Has anyone had experience doing this?  Will it work?

What is the currently recommended antifreeze to keep down the corrosion?
