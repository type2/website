It is sad that prices of some cars get pushed up by speculators who are not 
interested in driving them, only in making money out of them. Real VW 
enthusiasts would still love to own an old bus or whatever, even if it were 
worth next-to-nothing. All this does is put prices out of the reach of 
people who really care about old VWs and buy them because they like them for 
what they are.
