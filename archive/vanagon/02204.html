Subject: Re: Gasoline difference

Was there any difference in octane rating between the two brands? 
Wouldn't higher octane not only increase power but make the engine more 
&quot;efficient? Have you had any minor (air filter/ fule filter) or major 
(valves, head) r/r recently done?
 
There are too many variables at work here to narrow 
the change down to one monolithic causal factor.... 

Ideally you would want a control group and a comparison test to verify 
your results. Why not 
have half of us stick to one brand for say... three fill ups... and report 
back the results (ie combination city/hiway and highway only). While the 
other half fills up randomly with the same strategy. This would provide a 
useful comparison... assuming we had at least 50 persons participating 
(rejection of the null hypotheses...don't you know...)...the results would 
be statistically significant and a  summary could appear in the 
International Journal of Advanced Volkswagen Studies. 

I for one was getting 25 miles/imp. gal on the way back from CA. But have 
found in Canada that the mileage is somewhat less...hmmmm
