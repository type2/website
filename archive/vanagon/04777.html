&gt;Anyone want to theorize all the bad things that could happen if
&gt;you add TOO MUCH oil to your vanagon/bus?
&gt;
&gt;/martha
&gt;

Well, you could do like my little brother in his 84 Audi...for some
reason he thought he was loosing oil and over a period of some days
kept adding oil...and adding (I don't remember how much; but it was
*several* quarts too many).  One day he was driving and he saw a HUGE
black cloud in the rear-view mirror.  Kept swearing at the local yokels
who never tune up their cars until he realised (sheepishly) that he was
the yokel.  Nothing untoward happened to the car; didn't even blow
seals.  But then this car has been through a couple of accidents;
it seems to be built like a tank.
