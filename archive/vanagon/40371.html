&gt; Anyone have any reccomendation on what kind of roof racks will fit a
&gt; 76 Type II non camper. I want to put a couple of windsurfers up there.

Any rain gutter rack will fit.  Such as Thule, Yakima, Terzo.  I have the Thule 
for my Westy (with the fake, bolt-on rain-gutters) and carry 2 surfboards.  They 
do make a special windsurfer carrier to secure both the board and mast.
