The Inuvik Run -- At Inuvik

31 July 1996 

No surf.

No surf??

NO SURF!!!


The overcast sky lays flat atop the ground, the cloud base only
inches over your head.  The sky is the color of lead.

On the thirty-first day of July, 1996, just a few minutes before
9:00 P.M. local time the convoy rolled into the outskirts of
Inuvik.  Eddie Heintz, called The Original Eddie since Seattle
Eddie joined the convoy in Dawson, was dead on the side of the
road, having blown the seals on his left rear wheel cylinder and
pumped all of his hydraulic fluid overboard.  But we were at
Inuvik and the thought of a return trip with no brakes was a
trivial matter, something we would deal with, as we have dealt
with all of the other problems we've encountered.

The 231 mile run from Eagle Plains has taken ten hours, delayed
by waiting for the ferry across the Peel River at Ft. McPherson
and again crossing the Mackenzie River at Tsiigehtchic.  More time
 went down the tubes due to flats. Additional time vanished down 
the black hole when we stopped for a group photo at the Arctic
 Circle, 66-33 N.  Inuvik is at 68-21.

The Dempster Highway honors a turn of the century RCMP 
corporal who followed the route on a dog sled.  But the 
'highway' part of the name is a subtle joke.  For the most part
the Dempster is a one-lane graveled road having sloping 
shoulders wide enough to allow vehicles to pass,
assuming the slope is not too steep and the mud is not too deep,
the vehicles are traveling slowly and the drivers not screaming
too loud.

The Dempster is known to eat tires.  Even the most wildly
optomistic of Yuppie tourist brochures turned their head to one
side, coughed politely and suggested (in fine print) that you
carry two spares.  In the early months of preparing for the run I
paid scant attention.  One gravel road is pretty much like
another, right?  And I've seen my share of gravel roads.  The
Word came down from a truck driver who travels the Dempster on a
regular basis.  &quot;It's not paved with gravel.  They paved that
sonofabitch with arrowheads!&quot;  He was serious and I took him at
his word, adding two extra spares to my load.    

Where it crosses tundra, meaning the majority of its length, the
Dempster is not a road, it is a dike, a neatly piled heap of
stone and gravel deposited on top of the fragile tundra.  Any
other form of construction exposes the permafrost below the skin
of tundra.  And once exposed, the permafrost melts, producing an
impassible quagmire capable of swallowing the largest bulldozer
with astounding ease.

The Dempster dike is over 300 miles long, forty to sixty feet
wide at the base and six to twenty feet thick, the
dimensions determined by local conditions.  That is one hell of a
lot of material.  Building roads in the wilderness, you don't
have the luxury of ordering-in granite aggrigate from Ling Foo's
Road Building Take-away, you are forced to use whatever material
is available along the way.  North of the Oglive Mountains
ignious formations are rare but sedimentary rock is common.  The
Dempster Highway runs thru areas in which the most common road-
building material is remarkably brittle shale.  When crushed to
form gravel the shale shatters into arrowhead-shaped slivers
rather than chunks.  It is the shards of shale that have earned
the Dempster its reputation for devouring tires.

With fifty-six tires (fourteen vehicles) we suffered five flats
or blow-outs.  Statistically, we can expect at four more on our
way south.  Those who ignored the warnings and tackled the
Dempster shod with passenger-car tires were soon brought to a
halt by flats or blow-outs.  Those having spare truck tires
loaned them to those without and the convoy limped on, sore-
footed and wary.

If the sharp little shards of shale do not end up in your tires
they are eventually ground into a particularly cloying dust.  Add
a dollop of water and you have a marvelously sloppy mud which the
highway maintenance crews turn to gumbo by adding a neat layer of
clay as a topping.  The results have to be seen to be believed.

The Dempster also has a well-earned reputation for accidents, not
too surprising when you consider all the factors.  Each highway
maintenance camp had a grisley collection of crushed and crumpled
vehicles on display.

But we've made it.  We set out to drive to the top of the world
and we are here.  I am 4,005 miles from San Diego.  The trip has
taken 91.4 engine hours, an average of 43.8 miles per hour,
rather good when you consider my top speed is little more.  I've
purchased 194.2 gallons of fuel and have about 15 gallons
remaining onboard, giving me an average fuel consumption of 22.3
miles per gallon, although that figure is suspect due to
conversion factors and some leakage from the saddle tanks.

We made camp at a provincial campground a few miles outside of
Inuvik.  The weather is mild, the sky never truly dark.  Eddie
and Jorge have laagered their buses near mine.  There is
maintenance to do.  Eddie must deal with his blown brake system
while Jorge needs to find a replacement set of wheel bearings for
his right-front.  I must change my oil again, thanks to the dusty
conditions encountered between here and Prince George where I
last changed it.  There is laundry to do and meals to prepare and
reports, such as this, to write.  For me, the lay-over day in
Inuvik will be a busy time.

(After-trip comments:)
When I arrived at Inuvik I was, as always, the last vehicle to do
so.  The others were clustered on the side of the road and Eddie
was eagerly flagging me down.  He had a brake problem.  I thought
everyone had stopped beside him because of the problem but it
turned out to be some sort of conference about driving in to town
in convoy.  WHY we should drive through the town as a convoy was
not explained.  The town hadn't done anything to us.  

It was obvious Eddie should not be driving anywhere, except to
where we could work on his brakes.  He'd blown the seals on a
rear cylinder and fluid was dripping from the wheel,
contaminating the shoes and rendering the emergency brake
useless.  With no fluid in the system and mechanical braking on
only ONE (!) wheel, the idea of him working his way through a
town, however small, was not only dangerous it was stupid.  

It had been a long day.  Told we would be departing at 0800, I
arose early, mended a flat, broke camp, tended to the bus, loaded
the roof-rack... and then waited.  I was still waiting four hours
later.  We finally pulled out of Eagle Plains at 1130 and, also
as per usual, the faster vehicles dashed off down the road
leaving me to follow along.  

At Inuvik I waited about fifteen minutes for the group to get
their shit together.  They'd been parked for some time,
long enough for some of them to have driven into town,
shopped and come back.  I overheard a spirited discussion about
where to go for the best vegetarian pizza.  People were walking
their dogs, others were walking their kids.  Some were just
hanging out, chatting with one another.  I waited some more then
drove down to the campground.  I was tired and hungry and there
were chores to do. - rsh
