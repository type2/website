Subject: good news?


	I am thinking that I have pretty much made up my mind
just to break down and get a GEX rebuild for my bus.  Does sound
like the way to go?  Also, would anybody either have the goofy little
blower things you need to make the gas heater work and the temp sensing
wiring harness? 

	I have a heater in great shape, most of the wiring harness,
but am missing some of the ducting, the non return flaps, and some
other odd things.  Mr. Joel kindly forwarded a schematic for this some time
ago, but if I get this thing going again before winter, a heater would
be very, very good....

As always, good day

Matt
