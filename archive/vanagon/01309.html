Okay, okay.  I'll take a stab at it.  Hmm...  Let's see...
Alright!  Sung to the tune of Monty Python's 'I'm a lumberjack
and I'm Okay'

I love my Volksie and it's okaaaay...
Drive hills and dales the live long daaay...
Give it oil and gas and it smiles awaaay...
I wear panties and a braaa...   &lt;well, maybe not&gt;

I love my Volksie and it's okaaay...
I don't care what people saaay...
As I'm passed on the hiighhwaaay...
I wear panties and a braaa....   &lt;well, if it starts, why not&gt;
