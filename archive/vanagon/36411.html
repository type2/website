Subject: RE: Broken antenna on 87 vanagon


&gt;I usually use a self-serv car wash, but decided to treat
&gt;myself to the luxury of a drive-thru carwash the other day.
&gt;(heck, it was only $4. w/coupon)
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, I forgot to push the stock antenna down
&gt;first.... and it bent/broke in the process.
&gt;
&gt;Was wondering what options I have for replacements? Is it easy
&gt;to install a newer, flexible and higher powered one? How much $?


I once broke an antenna on my old '69 bus, and searched for a replacement
that was secured at more than one point (like '80s Toyota car antennas).
But, I was also broke, so wound up getting a cheapo from Radio Shack that
mounts both at its base, and also has a little pylon that slides onto
the antenna, and can be screwed into the sheet metal maybe 6&quot; to a foot
above the base.

Surprisingly, the reception was excellent! Since then, I've used this
antenna on every windshield-pillar mount antenna since. Never had one
broken in a car wash yet, due I'm sure to the two-point mounting.
