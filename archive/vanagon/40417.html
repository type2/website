Some yuppieEVEddieBauer type mentioned he figgered that Merle Watson wasn't
much compared to 'Hag.  Lemme tell you binko, Hag ain't fit to schlep Merle's
Gibson case insofar as pickin' goes.  Doc and Merle are folk legends, Hag 
although I dearly love his music, is a burned out druggie floatin on his laurels
so there.

If'n you get a chance to hear the likes of Merle W., just do it. 

OBVW: I've got a Diesel Red Book for 15$+post.
