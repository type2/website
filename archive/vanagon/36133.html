Subject: Min Disk thickness Vanagon


G'day all

My newly aquired (less than a month) Vanagon/Caravelle has PULSING 
brakes. Particularly bad after they have warmed.

The dealer &quot;must&quot; fix the problem but I dont want just skimmed disks 
when the disks are below spec.

Anyone got the minimum disk thickness for a 90 Vanagon? Mine has 
done 135 000 km, (85 000 m) and a lot of country running (no hills in 
Western Australia). Is this the expected life of VW disks?? ( my Ford 
wagon did 150 000 m and the disks were still OK)

Thanks for all the input re &quot;Leaky wasserboxer heads&quot;. Its nice to know 
there is some real mental artillery out there! ( I have accepted Joels 
kind offer re the Bently Manual, Thanks again)
