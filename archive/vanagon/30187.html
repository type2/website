Subject: EV Fog Light switches....


Robert asked about EV fog light switches available in the US. Well
they are...but they are actually fog light switches for 93/4
Passats. The difference between the EV switch (which BTW is unobtainable
here in the US) and the Passat is that the Passat switches are placed
horizontally while the EV switches are vertical. The little fog light
symbol is skewed 90 degrees.
