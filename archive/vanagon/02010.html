Subject: bricks across America (was vanagon.list group tour)


OK, I've heard from at least 15 of you who are
interested in this tour.  A few suggested doing something THIS
summer, say, at the Ben and Jerry's event, but for
most of you, this was too short of notice.  I hereby suggest
that the ones of you interested in doing something this August
form your own sub-group, and that the rest of you (us) plan on
1995 summer, which seems to be the favored time of year.

Keep your ideas and preferences flowing to me, I'll keep track
of them, and keep you all posted!
