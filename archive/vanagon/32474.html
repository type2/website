Subject: Don't Swap -- Add!

How about this approach to building a faster Vanagon:  take a Syncro,
replace trans with 2wd trans.  Replace center driveshaft with engine
and trans from a front-engine, rear-drive car, driving the front diff.
No modifications needed to the rear deck area, use the new engine cover
as a table, and no emissions hassles (unless you mention the other
engine).  You could even go hybrid, with an electric motor for the
front wheels and gas for the back.  

Whaddyathink!
