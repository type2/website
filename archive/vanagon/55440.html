&gt; &gt; &gt; List...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;         AVI seems to be priced a little better than GEX. Gex wants $1799. for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 1.9 and $1999. for the 2.1. Plus there is a $600. core deposit. Im
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure there is some room for bargining
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Well that decides it. My 2.1L is still running great after 112k, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; when the inevidible occurs, I'm putting in a GTI. GEX has 1800cc 110hp,
&gt; &gt; &gt; GTI engines for $929. plus a $300. core. With that added power I hope to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get better mileage too. Now to track down the needed parts...

&gt; &gt; Will a GTI engine mate up to the Vanagon bellhousing w/o modification or
&gt; &gt; adapters? Will the engine compartment hold that engine w/o major mods?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, with the following from a diesel Vanagon - oil pan, engine
&gt; mounts, bellhousing, oil filler, alternator bracket (I think). Not
&gt; sure about exhaust, maybe custom fab something using a dual outlet
&gt; GTI manifold, or one from a Fox. The stock diesel is single outlet.
&gt; Also you want to look for early GTI engine without knock sensor
&gt; ignition, ie: with CIS injection, unless you want to swap over the
&gt; wiring harness, ecu, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Since this is a fairly common question, I wouldn't mind having a FAQ
&gt; posted on it, unless it already is. If not, I'd be glad to post it on
&gt; my web site, if others could send me any pertinent articles. Any
&gt; takers?

	On a Syncro there are more consideratons. Eric Zeno says the gas tank
needs to be replaced with a German model. Also I think there might be a
conflict with the skidplate. I've never seen a syncro with a GTI, anyone
out there do this one before? I saw that porche V6 on the net, I'm not
interested in something like that.
