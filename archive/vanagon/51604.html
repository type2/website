Subject: 87 Vanagon GL Fuel Starvation on Down Incline

With my newly purchased 87 GL my called me and Vanagon had died nearby, 
I went to the Vanagon and observed:
1) Vanagon nose down on approx 25 deg grade on ramp leading from mall to 
service road.
2) Vanagon had 167 miles since last fill up
3) 1 gallon of gas added and 1 jumpstart (4-ways) and vanagon runs as 
before
4) Went to gas station and put in 9.6 gallons plus the .8 I put in on 
site = 11.4: There should have been at least 4 gallons in the tank
5) Fuel Tank is not leaking even a drop (I am aware of the connector 
line and it's affinity to leak)

The local VW shop said 87 GL has a 16 gallon tank, can anyone tell me if 
the fuel pickup is in the back of the tank and if so, would it be 
possible to starve the engine on a decent down incline with four gallons 
remaining?
Is this a fuel filter problem? 
Anyone experience anything like this? Any info appreciated.
Regards
Mark B. Magee
