I don't know that this will fix your problem, but check the ground
connections for fthe uel injection system.  I've had all sorts of weird
fuel injection problems in the past only to find a weak or just very
poor ground connection when at first glance the ground seemed fine.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello;  Recently my 87 GL has taken on another character trait.  after
&gt; running enough to get the temperature up, the idle stays at 2000 rpm.
&gt; Sometimes (about 1 in 10) it will drop back to 1000. Another (possibly
&gt; related) symptom is when de-cellerating the van will hiccup, similar
&gt; to
&gt; running out of gas sensation.  I checked the engine compartment for
&gt; obvious
&gt; problems, nothing, everything is tight with nothing dis-connected.
&gt; Oh, I
&gt; recently had the engine compartment pressure washed, and these
&gt; symptoms
&gt; started after that.  What is the problem?  Where should I start?
&gt; TIA  Larry Carter
