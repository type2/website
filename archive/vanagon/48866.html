Subject: Vacation time...

Hello Everyone.  I'll be unsubscribing from the list until October as 
it is now time for my vacation.  Things are catching up to me as our 
departure time nears, so I'll have to &quot;catch up&quot; using Skip's 
invaluable archive.

We plan on spending 24 days in the Canadian Rockies leaving Sept 2.  
We have many hikes planned in Glacier, Yoho, Banff, and Jasper 
National Parks... just can't get enough of those mountains!  

After our Rockies trip, we'll be heading out to the Okanagan to pick 
our annual supply of wine to get us through the winter :)

Take care everyone, and I'll &quot;see&quot; you in October!

Harry.
