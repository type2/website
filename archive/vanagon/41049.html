Subject: Re: Rocking of the Van...serious advice needed!

In a message dated 96-04-30 21:30:45 EDT, you write:

&gt; then next think you know the van is a rockin' and ya get whistles and yells
&gt;&gt; from all over the place...*blush* hmm, is there a way to level out the van
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; keep it from rocking so much? maybe some of those RV stands? camp where no
&gt;one
&gt;
&gt;

if this is your worst problem, getting too much and everyone knowing it, I
should have your problem.  how did you get any in the first place if you're
so shy?
