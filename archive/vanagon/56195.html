Hey all,
Here are some directions to Kiptopeke State Park.

The park is located only three miles from the northern terminus of the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, so it's on the very southern tip of the
Eastern Shore.  It's on Route 704, which is off of Route 13.  

If you're coming from the D.C. area (like Alexandria or Takoma Park) you
may want to get on Route 50 east and cross over the bridge to the shore,
at which point Route 50 splits into Route 301 going north and Route
50 going south.  Route 50 will eventually connect with Route 13 (Route
50 and 13 are both U.S. Routes), with Route 50 going east and Route 13
going south.  You want to get on Route 13 and follow it all the way down
until you encounter Route 704 (should be on the right) and the park
entrance is within a half mile.  Calculating this using the map scale
and my own crude devices, this works out to about 180 miles, give or
take a few.  I'm not sure how much time it will take, depends on what
kind of road Route 50 and 13 are.

If you're coming from Pennsylvania or New Jersey, your best bet is
probably to stick with Interstate 95 until you get into Delaware, at
which point you can pick up Route 13 south directly.

If you're anywhere else in Maryland, probably you want to go the same
way as the D.C. folks.  

If you're coming from The Richmond area, your shortest trip will
probably be to get on Interstate 64 east until you get to Norfolk and
then pick up Route 13 north there and go over the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge-Tunnel (I think the toll is $10 or so but it is a 21 mile long
bridge-tunnel -- might be worth the price just for the novelty).
Of course, once you reach the other end, go about three miles, then turn
west on Route 704 and you come to the park.  This trip should be roughly
120 miles.  

Me, I'm kinda in the middle.  Fredericksburg is right in between D.C.
and Richmond, so I've got a long trip no matter how I cut it.  I may go
in one way and out the other, it's probably about the same either way.
I would like to drive the bridge-tunnel.  But it's probably too
expensive to do it twice :-) .  Hmm, I get to add 50 miles to either
way.  

And John Anderson, you may be best off just taking Route 50 all the way
in.

Any questions or corrections (I'm sure people know some good shortcuts)
please e-mail me.

Sean
