Subject: Re: Convincing my wife...

&gt;&gt;IGNORE those other posts which advise buying the bug and asking forgiveness
&gt;&gt;later.  This is a VERY bad thing.  Honesty is the basis of ANY good
&gt;&gt;relationship.  DON'T risk upseting your wife with this new acquisition.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;        I have to say that I agree with this concept. If I pulled that
&gt;stunt Samantha would have me for breakfast...   &amp; I'd be in the doghouse
&gt;for a good period of time-perhaps until I got rid of the offending vehicle.
&gt;If she doesn't agree at first, keep at her. Maybe this deal won't go down,
&gt;but with time I've convinced Sam that we need a splittie, so now all I have
&gt;to do is find one (and some cash) and I can buy it with her blessing!!
&gt;Whoopee!!!  Of course, Texas is not exactly the home of the profuse
&gt;splitties...
&gt;

Same here. I REALLY like my bus and I would WANT to jump on a good VW
deal...but I LOVE my wife and family. If it weren't for Kristy, I'd go
crazy and buy 3, 4, or maybe even 5 old buses and park them along the
street and in the yard (I know other list members have managed to avoid
this obsession ;). She puts a nice sanity check into the equation. In the
end, all that matters are the living things. We buy these things to enjoy
with the people we love.

And yes, Kristy's already agreed that a splittie would be nice 8).
