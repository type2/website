Subject:      how to find a short

Hi listmembers... I've got a short somewhere in my 89 Westy.   I've put in a
new battery, thinking that this was the problem, but by the battery
indicator, and lack of starting power after just a couple of days, I know
that there must be a short somewhere..  For someone with just a very basic
understanding of how to work a multimeter, what steps can I take to find this
short?
Thanks,
