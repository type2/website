Sherwin,
Well, there are two lights that you seem to be describing, both relating to
the Syncro's optional rear differential lock.  Note that the operation of the
Syncro All-Wheel-Drive system is not affected by the use or non use of the
rear differential lock.  The Syncro is always in All-Wheel-Drive mode.

The lights in the differential lock control panel operate as such:
One light is to help you see the control panel and turns on/off with the
headlights.  The other light (the important one) indicates when the
differential lock is engaged.  When you pull out the knob in the console, you
are &quot;requesting&quot; that the differential lock be engaged.  Within a few seconds
or so, depending on your speed and direction, the lock will then engage.
 When it does engage the light on the console (where the rear differential is
in the little drivetrain picture) will come on.  When you push the knob back
in, you are then requesting that the differential become unlocked.  Like the
locking, the unlocking takes place within a few moments, then the light goes
out.  The reason for these delays is that the locking mechanism needs to wait
until splines in the differental line up in order to engage them.

Good luck with your Syncro!
