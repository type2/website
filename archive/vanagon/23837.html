Subject: Battery Plates

hey now,

okay, i'm going to have to order a battery plate...anyone have a number for
Rocky Mountain? also...if i can't get this done for this weekend, would it be
bad to run the engine on a short weekend trip with  something rigged up before
i get it welded? i understand the pressure will be off and i don't want to
ruin the engine obviously, but i really want to take the van this weekend. i'll
only be going about 200 miles.

thanks,

jonathan
