About the following:  

Bob writes: (explaining 'crush')


Crush is the wedging effect that occurs with gears when the engagement is too
deep.

The face of a gear tooth is not straight, it prescribes a subtle ogive curve,
a very sexy thing that starts nearly flat but curves at an increasing rate,
the rate having to do with the pitch (or basic shape) of that gear.

As one with a 27 year old piece of paper that says I am an ingineer/lektrikal
- I'm impressed with both Bob's knowledge, attention to detail and ATTITUDE. 
What he is describing is what I understand as &quot;blueprinting&quot; an engine.  Any
time he wants to come work on one of mine, here's a standing public
invitation!!!!
