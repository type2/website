Happy Canadian Thanksgiving Van-o-philes:

Our volunteer org. that helps fund our local library through book sales has
received a service manual for Rabbit/Scirocco 1975-1979
 [Bentley Stock Number VRB9/ VW Part # LPV 997 173]
 It is in basically UNUSED condition. [Shows signs of having been leafed
thru for interest...no heavy use or &quot;shop stains&quot; .
We would like to get $20  for it [CDN  *OR*  US as shipping to US would be
more $$}
Please reply directly to me
at    e-mail # or [519] 538-3035

Thanks
