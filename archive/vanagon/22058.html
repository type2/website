Subject: RE: solenoid and pinion gear

  There shouldn't be any voltage applied to the windings of the starter
  solenoid until the key is in the &quot;start&quot; &lt;second&gt; position. 

  If my understanding of VW starters is correct, twisting the key to the
  second position energizes the solenoid. The solenoid simultaneously moves
  the starter pinion to the ring gear and, at the end of it's travel, closes
  the &quot;big mutha&quot; contacts allowing current to flow to the starter motor.

  What year bus are we discussing regarding this problem? Is there some
  other relay or solenoid that could be making this sound? For example,
  If I turn the key to the first position on my '74 with the throttle open,
  the EGR soleniod  makes a audible &quot;click&quot;.
