Subject: New VW page for parts

Skip-
I have started a page so people can find parts for their projects.
I would like to exchange links with you, and could use any 
help/reccomendations/comments. The page is very basic right now, but I 
will be continually improving it. Thanks in advance,

I am receiving E-mail at a friend's box for a few days.
