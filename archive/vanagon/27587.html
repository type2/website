Subject: Bayarea pizza thing?

Well... Kelley McDaniel &lt;boatman_at_sound_dot_net&gt; is planning on being through the
bay area in the middle of next week. He's going from Kansas to the PNW.  It
might be Wednesday... or maybe not.  He's not sure about his schedule last I
heard.  Since he's coming to Hayward to get a fuel tank I thought Ye Old
Pizza Joint in San Lorenzo would be a great place to meet.  6 pm would be a
good time.  It's got great pizza, and the music is very interesting... one
might even say unique. 

So... anyone that's interested in meeting up for pizza next week with a 
long distance Vanagon person Email me with your phone number.  That way I 
can call if there's a change.  If things go as planned 


Bradley
