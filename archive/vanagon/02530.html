 Hi y'all,
	Another bus ('72 westy) is headin' for the mountains later 
this week. Actually , I'll be in Fort Collins at this conference and 
I hope to camp out near Estes Park while there. Anyone have
any experience with 2bbl webers prog. under these conditions. When 
should I rejet 'em. ? Also is there a good source for weber parts out
there ?  I really am green when it comes to these types of 
altitudes and I could probably use any advice offered. Also,
is there a good bus shop out there in Fort Collins ? Can I find
a place to camp out near Estes Park at this time of year with
all the vacationers and such. Otherwise I'll have to find a campsite 
on the Colorado State campus. 	In addition, I'll have to sleep
over somewhere near Lincoln , Nebraska .. anyone have any
suggestions ?  Mostly, I need a source for 'overnight' weber parts,
and I need camping info too.

p.s. The hell with all those commercials, I saw so many 'real' buses
and westies and bugs this last weekend parked all over the street and in
yards and driveways, I thought I was in Mexico. Madison's Eastside
sure has its share of volksies !
