Subject: re:How tall is a Westy????

Tom,

I looked in the owners manual for my '79 and it says 80 1/8&quot;. That is to
the top of the curve on the top. The poptop on the breadloafs are
thicker than on the vanagons, but there may be added headroom in the
cabin of the vanagons.  I am running 185/70's for tires.  Regardless, I
think the 80&quot; figure is about right.

Hope this helps.

Well, just taking care of the last minute details about getting back my '82
Westy from Orlando. I'll be on the Amtrak Auto-train from Orlando to
Washington,DC. Amtrak is telling me that the max height of the van can be no
more than 85&quot;. Do you think it will fit? Anyone feel like measuring theirs?
Not you Synchro guys with the big BFG T/A's, though!!  :)  Thanks!

Just want to make sure I don't scrape the top in the train!
