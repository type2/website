Subject: Re: #1 firing position on 009? (2.0 l FI)

Wait, wait, wait -- you sound majorly confused. First off, I don't notice 
any  power curve problem with my 009 in my '73 w/'81 engine, nor did I in 
my '69 bus w/1600 engine (1750cc actually) --- secondly, there can't 
possibly be a difference in firing order, or the thing wouldn't run. 
Thirdly, valve settings have absolutely nothing to do with it. 
   However, I don't know that the 009 is going to work real well with 
fuel injection, since the FI computer will want to alter the spark advnce 
as well as the fuel delivery. Perhaps someone has tried it, and it 
doesn't significantly matter. I'd try it.

    All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace!
