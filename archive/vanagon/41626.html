Subject: weird happenings II

Hey all,
I've been thinking about this morning's weirdness with my '78.  I wonder if the cause of my mysterious engine cutoff could have been electromagnetic inteference??  

I recall there being a dump truck behind me when this event occured.  If you don't know what event I'm talking about, read my other post.
I don't know how well shielded the early control units were against that kind of thing.  If this dump truck driver had his CB boosted too high, could it have shut my engine down?  And then as soon as he was off, it started right up (maybe).

What do you think of this theory?  I know it's not a likely explanation, but it's never happened before and I don't have any other symptoms of a bad ignition system, like missing, hesitating, etc.

I wonder...

Sean
