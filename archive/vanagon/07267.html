&gt;     P.S. Air conditioning is for sissies - besides, it not part of the &quot;Be-Here
&gt;     -Now&quot; philosophy that is essential to _real_ VW Bus wandering. (this should
&gt;     provoke a response; hee, hee, hee, grin)

&quot;Be-Here-Now&quot; philosophy?  Is that a Muirism or what?  If so, I don't recall that
