To ALL the Vanagon Listees, from ALL the Americas, North &amp; South, including
us southerners for you Canadians, and us Yankees for ya'll southerners. 
Thank you from the bottom of my expansion tank for your suggestions on my
coolant leak problem.  I think the leaking seam in the top of the expansion
tank theory sound plausable and a lot cheaper than a head gasket :(  For
the heck of it I'm going to try to tape some cloth or paper towel to the
top of the tank and see if the seam is split, in theory it should get wet
right? or I suppose it could be a bad hose - maybe? :)
