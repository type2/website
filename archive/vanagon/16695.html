Subject: Re: Ethical question:Apology

&gt;Rusty Apologizes if the reply was perceived as being malicious or mean
&gt;spirited. I only meant to encourage the author of the original post toward a
&gt;mind set of awareness toward the realities of the world as it is rather than
&gt;place themselves or their property at risk over idealogical issues. I wish
&gt;no one to get hurt either by vandals, thieves, carelessness, or rudeness on
&gt;the list. My comments were clearly out of line. I did not intend to be an
&gt;example of the type of people that cause us all to lock our doors. My
&gt;intention of &quot;redneck Rusty&quot; humor was over the line. Peace

Whoo.  Thanks for this.  As a newbie, I don't really have much of a say in
the direction of the list, but I like to hope it's a freindly place.  Your
comments show that it is.  Thanks again.

(The original post *was* silly.  Part of me suspects it was a troll.)

Peace,
Ron
