&gt; &gt; From New York: No responsibility for property lost or stolen ...
&gt;   it's THE TOP TEN LIST for Tuesday, January 17, 1995.  And now,
&gt;   your television pal ... David Letterman!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; From the home office in Sioux City, Iowa ...
&gt; 
&gt; TOP TEN DALLAS COWBOY EXCUSES
&gt; 
&gt; 10. Afraid to play in Super Bowl against anyone but the Bills
&gt; 
&gt;  9. Distracted by delicious smell of barbecue coming from John
&gt;     Madden's announce booth
&gt; 
&gt;  8. Trying to make one of Marv Albert's blooper reels
&gt; 
&gt;  7. Our friends on New York Jets convinced us: &quot;Winning's no big
&gt;     deal&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  6. Worried sick about Letterman botching the Academy Awards
&gt; 
&gt;  5. Those big guys on other team kept trying to knock us down
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Who needs all the pressure of a Super Bowl? Not us, Lonnie!
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Felt weird after eating bloody clams [During a &quot;Supermarket
&gt;     Finds&quot; segment, Dave displayed a can of bloody clams]
&gt; 
&gt;  2. What a time to notice -- them cheerleader outfits is skimpy!
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Tired of going to Disneyland
&gt; 
&gt;         [Music: &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; by the Beatles]
