&gt;Will somebody explain to me about hydraulic valve lifters?  What their function
&gt;is, and how they achieve it?  What their relation to oil pressure is?  And what
&gt;it means for one to collapse?  (That's what I've got, collapsed valve
&gt;lifters.  I don't know how that compares with fallen arches...)  I've got
&gt;the Bentley manual, so you can refer to pages in there.
&gt;At this point my understanding is that their only purpose is a cushioning
&gt;effect.

from Road &amp; Track's Illustrated Auto Dictionary:
Hydraulic Valve Lifter - a lifter that by means of hydraulic oil pressure
maintans zero valve clearance (no cleanance between metal parts) so that
valve noise is reduced.  Such a design also compensates for normal wear and
eliminates periodic valve adjustments.

hmmm. ok, how bout this: from Bosch automotive handbook, 1st edition (oddly
enough,there is NOTHING in the newest 3rd edition):
Hydraulic Tappet
the function of this tappet is to minimize the play in the valve gear,
originating from thermal expansion and wear.  For this purpose it can
&quot;telescope&quot; inward or outward.  The hydraulic tappets most frequently in use
are connected to the engine-oil circulation system.  When telescoped outward,
oil flows via the non-return valve into pressure chamber A (see diagram below).
When telescoped inward, oil is forced out of the pressure chamber by the
engine valve spring pressure via the piston clearance B.  Hydraulic
compensation of play frequently takes place at the head of the pushrod.

diagram: well ... think of it as a tiny barrel within a barrel. and at the
bottom of the inner barrel is a ball-valve and a spring. the spring pushes
the inner barrel up to the top of the outer barrel, and the ball-value lets
oil into and out of the inner barrel (chamber A). in the diagram, that B
points to the joint between the inner barrel and the outer barrel.

now that you are hopelessly confused, so am i. i started out thinking i knew
what they were, but as i wrote, i became less sure. so i got these books.
now i'm even less sure. :)

but! i'm pretty sure about this: when a valve lifter 'collapses', it means
that the little spring has 'collapsed' and can't keep that little ball in
place ... so the oil just flows in and out of the little barrel-shaped lifter,
and the lifter doesn't change size like it is supposed to. so that valve
isn't being lifted as it should, and it clatters. just like on a beetle,
when it needs the valves adjusted.

and hydraulic lifters will leak down their pressure over time ... like
overnight. sometimes sooner if they are old. so when you crank the car,
you'll hear them clattering until the oil pressure is built up inside of
them again ... and that takes a minute or so. even longer in winter when
the oil is thick and doesn't flow easily.

their 'function' is to always take up the 'slack' between the cam and the
push rod ... to always expand in both directions to push against both. if
the oil pressure of the engine is low, then the lifters will not 'pump' up
enough (cause the oil can't be forced into the little barrels against the
spring pressure), and you get lots of valve clatter noise.

ok. that sounds good. :)  now ... what did i get wrong?

joel.
p.s. if you park a vanagon on the side of a hill (about a 20 degree tilt)
overnight, it will scare the hell outa you in the morning when you crank
it!!! one whole side of the engine seems to be empty of oil, and it makes
a helluva racket for about 20 seconds.
