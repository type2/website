Subject: RE: Dave Easterwood's Holiday Trek II


&gt;Dave is still scheduled to fly into Kansas City tomorrow night to pick up
&gt;a 65 Camper that I'm the middle man on.  The last report from Dave to the
&gt;list was inappropriate engine behavior on the '65's single port.  Here's
&gt;what the problems were:

You are making Dave's trip much safer and more enjoyable. I am in a position
to know, thanks to the tremendous above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty help
given me by Bob Hufford, of list fame, during the V6anagon/Route 66 trip
I did a few weeks ago. Kudos!



&gt;  Valve adjustment needed attention
&gt;  The coil wires were criss-crossed
&gt;  Condensor &amp; points were shot (vacuum advance is fine though)
&gt;  The brass snubbers on the spark plugs were not utilized as the spark
&gt;     plug wires needed them causing timing wierdness

Are these the little screw-on things that always come with new plugs,
to be screwed onto the plug tips in all cars except air-cooled VWs?
I've never seen an air-cooled VW  that uses them, anyway. Are you sure
you have the correct plug wires? Do they have the rubber air seals on the
plug boots, that fit flush against the engine tin when you push the wire
onto the plug? If not, I would replace the wires instead of fiddling with
the screw-on thingies if I were you.

Actually, I guess you've already done a lot to this bus to get it ready,
maybe/probably including this. Sorry if my normal bigmouthedness has
gotten ahead of me...


&gt;  '65 only wiper motor is nowhere to be found and the 66 wiper motor
&gt;     that came with it will not easily fit
&gt;  One kingpin needs attention
&gt;  Wiring is minimal (lights etc. are not hooked up)
&gt;
&gt;*None of these things seemed to bother Dave.  We'll spend Thursday
&gt;getting things together for his trip back to Atlanta

The first four thing would bother me, but the rest wouldn't, for this trip
anyway, unless the king pin was worn enough to make the front end 
unalignable
and the bus ate its front tires on the way home. I guess he'll be travelling
during daylight only? In that case lights are optional, but don't tell the
Highway Patrol I said so  :^)

Good luck, Dave. Bring a flashlight, a tow strap, lotsa tools, and a Rand
McNally! Don't put pointy tools in your carry-on luggage at the airport, and
remember that a big tip will keep the skycap from wondering why your (tool-
filled) suitcases weigh more than you do.

Enjoy...
