Subject: RE: Serie -vs- Parallel


Ooops, Terry is (at least partially) right (explanation follows):

in a serial connected configuration, the actual current is given by:
(omitting a lot of not-so-important terms)

                   Va + Vb + ........ + Vn
(1)   current =  ----------------------------------
                   Ra + Rb + ........ + Rn + Rload

where  Va .... Vn are the battery voltages, and Ra ....... Rn are the 
battery internal resistances, respectively for batteries a through n.
Rload is the resistance of the load, for instance, an appliance, electric
motor, etc.. (electric motors, especially starters, have varying Rload
values, depending on the load.  The more the load, the smaller the
Rload -- but that's a different topic entirely).


Soo, if (for the CCA measurement, anyway) the Rload is made to be very, very
small, and assuming two identical batteries, (Va = Vb and Ra = Rb), the 
above equation becomes:

                                                  2Va          Va
      max current with two identical batteries = -------- = ----------
                                                  2Ra          Ra

and, if we check out the max. current for a single battery, (Rload --&gt; 0 )

                                       Va
      max current with one battery = --------
                                       Ra

which is the same as the max current (  == CCA ? ) with two identical
batteries in series.

However, the CCA is not that of the weakest battery, either.

if you use eqn. (1), for batteries of equal voltage, but different
internal  resistances (hence different CCAs),


                                                       2Va  
 max curr. w different batt. ( Va = Vb, Ra != Rb ) = -------  
                                                       Ra+Rb

in other words, for two batteries of equal voltage, after a few substitutions:


                          2 * (max curr. of A) * (max curr. of B )
  max overall current = --------------------------------------------
                              (max curr. of A) + (max curr. of B )


is this bad enough, or should I ramble on more???

 &gt; 
 &gt; But, I think that series connected batteries are limited only by the current
 &gt; capacity of the weakest link in the chain, so the CCA of series connected
 &gt; batteries wouldn't be halved, but would be equal to the CCA of the lowest rated
 &gt; battery in the chain.  This is because the same current flows through both
 &gt; batteries, so the only limit is how much can flow through any one, before the
