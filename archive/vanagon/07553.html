&gt;It seems the consumer report never said anything good 
&gt;about VWs. The only
&gt;good cars are always Japanese cars. The funny thing is 

Funny, that.  The usual thing on the green island is that we 
all deride Japanese cars as being characterless, boring and 
prone to tin-worm.

But Ireland buys more Japanese cars per head than any other 
European country.  We've no car manufacturers - so we've no 
quotas.  Toyota (eeeuuugh) is the best selling marque here for 
the last two zillion aeons.

However ... the Toyota Hi-ace (refered to as the Hi-ack-eee ;) 
) was the most popular light commercial until 1992.  Now it's 
#2.

WHY?   (heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee)

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
*** Transporter - #1 in Ireland!

as the 'changing room'...
