then they must have sold most of that 20 here in the bay area. i'm 
pretty sure i've see at least a dozen of them around here since we 
bought ours.

i'm assumeing that out of about 40 to 50 sightings, i am seeing some 
several times, that's how i figure on a minimum of about 12 or 13 
eurovans that i have PERSONALY seen around here.

so your 20 for the U.S. seems like it needs at least 2 more zeros added
to it {now don't be nasty and ask if i'm volenteering myself as one of
the zeros}.
