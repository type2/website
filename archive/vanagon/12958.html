Subject: Re: The shower thing :}



Please excuse me if this has been mentioned before.  There is a 
very handy showering device made for camping.  It consists of a 
large black plastic bag which is hung up in the sun. Solar power
heats it up quickly.  Has a tube leading down to a shower head
which has an on/off valve.  I'm sure they're available at one
of your local camping supply places.  If not try Campmor at
it's 1.800 number. Call directory assistance, can't remember the #.
A friend of mine had one of these out in Colorado and raved about it.
