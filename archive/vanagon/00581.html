Subject: T4 engine cases.

Just a few questions / thoughts..

1) I'm almost done the lastest bus engine. Muldooned from several engines,
but it should be good for a while. This summer I'm building a good engine
(stock, but high quality).. Does anyone know where New/NOS T4 cases could
be found? How much?

2) I've heard that the T4 case (being aluminium) is much more tolerant and
produces better quality than a T1 when align bored. True?

3) Seeing as Berg don't do T4's, can y'all recommend someone who sells top
quality full rebuild kits? (crank, cam, etc.)

Jamie
