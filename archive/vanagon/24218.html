Subject: Exact Formula for L82 Deltron

L82 &quot;Silver White&quot; is typically used only on the bumpers, wheels, and where
applicable, the poptop for the Westfalias. This L82 differs from the L87
&quot;Pearl White.&quot; The &quot;Silver White&quot; has a very, very slight bluish hue to it.
The Pearl is a very slight &quot;warm&quot; white. Although other color combinations
were available, the Pearl White was applied to the top half of many of the
splittie buses. A buddy of mine owns a body shop (that I should have gone
to). He has restored many buses and has acquired the exact formula for the
L82 &quot;Silver White.&quot; The formula is provided to the best of our knowledge for
the advancement of your project of general archives. Use this formula at
your own risk. Rusty VanBondo/Jim Ellis accepts no liability for use
of/application of this paint.

(I will be using it on the '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell.&quot;)
