Subject: 1987 Camper Center Swivel Seat

Camperites,

I've looked at the 1987 Camper Supplement to the Vanagon Owner's Manual and
found a Center Swivel Seat pictured and described as optional.  Do any of you
Camper owners have this option on a USA Vanagon.  It mounts in the center
area of the van, seats 1 passenger, has two armrests and a lockable
compartment in the base.  I have personally never seen one of these and am
trying to determine if they exist on Vanagons made for the USA.  I think that
if it was available, it would just be on GL model Campers.
