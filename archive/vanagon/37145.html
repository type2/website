So Thomas Zallen says:
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had a similar experience?  Is it possible that this new computer
&gt; unit is faulty?

I'm sure most of the group, me included has experienced the hesitation.  
Previous posts from the likes of Dennis Haynes, Joel Walker, Dan Houg,
Tim Smith &amp; myself (And there are more) indicate that the best thing
to do is check the wiring and make sure there are no cold solder joints
or questionable grounds.  Prolonged intermittent shorts tend to damage
the various electrical components of the F.I. system and eventually
large amounts of $$$ to leave your bank accounts.  Tend to the small
things first so they don't become big things.

&gt; Are the events (the head gasket replacemnet and subsequenr stalling)
&gt; possibly related?  Are head gasket problems common in older vans (mine has
&gt; about 80k)?  If so, can anything be done?

Absolutely not unless the van is overheating.

&gt; These may be common questions, but I am new to the list.  Any help would be
&gt; much appreciated.

It doesn't hurt the list to go over these things again, but I suggest you
check the archives before you post.
