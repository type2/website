&gt;Does anyone have a good index for fair prices on used parts?
&gt;We are getting several used items and want to know if these are
&gt;reasonable prices:
&gt;speedo/odo - 50
..... if it works ok, sounds good to me.
&gt;fuel guage - 20
..... if it works ok, ... sounds kinda high, maybe $10?
&gt;sliding door lock mechanism - 50
..... about right. Gerry got one for this (but a lot of the other parts came
      with it).
&gt;driver's side window regulator - 40
..... ?? probably about right, but i'd rather pay $25-30 ... just 'feels'
      better. but i'm not in california. ;)
