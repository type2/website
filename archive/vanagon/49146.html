Subject: Re: 84 Westy emgine missing/fuel starved

Rick, A Wolfsburg was a special model VW started producing at the end of the
1984 model run.Basically a westy w/ improvements that would be standard on
1985 models including, power steering,tach,lcd clock,sunroof in poptop,velour
seats, special paint scheme and, most importantly, a 2 person, removable
middle seat.Your 85 has most of the options.I got a single middle seat from a
1985 westy wolf so I can slide in the double or single.I believe VW continued
to make Wolfsburgs w/ varios options for the rest of the vanagon run.Maybe
some of the other guys could confirm this.Joel....oh Joel are you listening?
