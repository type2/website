Subject: if people are trying to reach me today

old parts hunters and associated friends,

due to awful air quality in the office today i will likely be moving to a
building where i lilely can't respond to e-mail.

all you people out there that are contacting me re; the parts bonanza &lt;g&gt;
please be patient. the panel van is what i would really like to move, i am
flexible on the price, make an offer :)

hopefully the air will be made nice and pretty soon

michael
