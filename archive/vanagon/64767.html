Subject:      Re: How to get on the Type2 list

&gt; send email to    type2-request_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com

Well thats what I tried but did not work. That is not the current address.

Subsequently I found that to get on go to www.type2_dot_com and subscribe from
there. Have not seen anything yet though.
