Subject: &lt;Syncro&gt;  viscous coupling 

Ho Syncronauts,
(sorry for bandwidth others)

Anyone got a dead coupling they want to send me for dissassembly/analysis?
It  will be returned, if wanted back.  I am trying to track down the fluid,
so far Dow and 3M don't look to make anything like it.  Dow supplies
Chrysler/Jeep/Talon with a very very viscous silicone for use in
differentials, NOT same functionality as the S-D-P couplings, not likely
adaptable either.  Both companies were surprised by the description of the
fluid in the S-D-P coupling.  I want to analyse the geometry of the coupling
and figure out viscosity requirements.

Anyhow, if you have a dead coupling lying around, send it too me pls.  I
have access to an engine dyno (with an industrial 1200cc VW engine mounted
:) ) and can check out the coupling/fluids if we get lucky.   

bye, tim
