Subject: Re: Results from a compression test.

If you say so.  NO compression would seem to me to be more than just &quot;out
of adjustment valves&quot;.  I can't think of a likely senario where TWO
cylinders would have ZERO compression and not have it be catastophic.  But,
I will concede that I've never adjusted the valves to achieve that effect.
I'm very curious.  Please let us know what the verdict is.

&gt;   No it's not! It's just sleeping.  I had a emgine with NO compression on
&gt;2 cylinders and it was a simple vavle adjustment.  After that it has run
&gt;fine and still is.  No compression can mean a bunch of things.  Don't give
&gt;up so quickly.  If after a valve adjustment you still have no compression
&gt;then I'd say it may be toast but it still may be just a head not an entire
&gt;engine!  I don't want to replace an engine or rebuild a bottom end unless
&gt;I REALY have to.
