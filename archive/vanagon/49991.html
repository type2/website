Subject: RE: Kombi question again

I can't ameliorate your CA title situation, other than by wishing you luck,
but on the basis of having visited Germany this summer, I can say that in
Germany they have everything you can imagine in Vanagons and EVs.  Your
Syncro Kombi is probably the type of unit I saw painted in camoflage
colors for the German army.  The police are currently driving both Vanagons
and EVs, all in chromeless versions right down to the painted hubcaps.
Doublecabs are more common than single, and most of both have canvas over
the beds.  I can't remember seeing a Vanagon with a fiberglas cap there
(altho now that I look I see them in the catalog I brought home.)

Sadly, breadloaves, splits, and even aircooled Vanagons are rare on German
roads, to the point where my Vanagon-spotter son (8 years old) would make
sure I'd noted the passing of an aircooled bus.  But watercooled Vanagons
are still a very popular work truck, with or without windows, with or with-
out highroof.

Good luck straightening Sacremento out.
