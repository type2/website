In PGH, PA:

1974 Westfalia VW camper van for sale.

Orange and beige paint, with orange canvas (canvas has a few small tears,
easily patched).  Sink with hand pump and tap, and icebox.  4 speaker, AM/FM
cassette.  Upholstered seat/storage box between front seats.  Body is in good
condition.  Booster springs in front and rear.  Orange privacy curtains all
the way around.

I have a VDO (original equipment) dash clock that I have not installed.

150,000 miles, with an engine rebuild.

Single carbeuretor 1800cc engine (the hard-to-sychronize dual carbs were
replaced).  Runs like a champ!

My wife and I have had this camping several times the last year or so; it's
wonderful.  We're only selling it because we're upgrading to an '82 camper.

I know the previous owner paid $3000 for this about 3 years ago; I'd like to
get around $1800.  I'm going to have it in the shop for brakes and inspection
late this week or early next week, and then it's good to go!


Thanks,
--Dale
