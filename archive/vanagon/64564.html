Subject:      Repair Front Rack and Pinion?

I recently got my 87 Westy Syncro realigned and the mechanic told me I
needed a new Rack and Pinion. I don't have the $700 required to fix it.
What happens if I don't get it repaired?
Thank you in advance,
Brent Gardner

P.S. Does anyone know of any good Vanagon mechanics in Eugene, Oregon?
