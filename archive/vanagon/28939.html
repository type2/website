&gt; The most irritating recent development is that my poptop latch has begun to

I've found rattles in two places.  One, is at the point where the 
'push up bar' ears rest on the opening into the top.  there is a 
rubber cushsion that needs to be on the end of that ear.  in 
addition, i stuck a self-adhesive rubber 'foot' for project boxes on 
the opening where the ear rests.

secondly, the pop latch is adjustable.  take a good look at it and 
you'll see that 2 bolts can be loosened and the latch slid up or down 
to add/reduce the catch tension.

lastly, you can stick towels and bungees everywhere like the rest of 
us do  :)
