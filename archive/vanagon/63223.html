Sorry to hear you have a lemon. I've owned my 93 EV/MV since new...yes there
have been some minor problems (most every car I've owned has had them) but
overall I've been very satisfied with the EV, which now has 60K+ miles on
it. Before we bought ours we looked at the $hitboxes sold by Chrysler, Ford,
GM, etc....none of them &quot;communicated&quot; with me...none of them had
&quot;personality&quot;....none of them had a manual transmission, or were fun to
drive...they were nothing more than vehicles designed for &quot;drones&quot; to drive
to work...to bring the kids to &quot;soccer practice&quot;, etc....

Would I buy another (assuming VW sold vans again in the US), you better
believe it!
