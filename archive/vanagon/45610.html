&gt; &gt;not fused and should be hot all the time.

&gt; 
&gt; Check your wiring diagram.  Where does the *POWER* come from and go to the
&gt; ignition switch?  Line 30 goes from the positive connection on the starter (always
&gt; hot) to the #8 fuse block top connector.  From there it is bridged (does not pass
&gt; through the fuse) and goes to the 30 connector on the headlight switch.  From that
&gt; connector it is bridged and goes to the 30 connector on the ignition switch.


I thought that was what I wrote???????

 
&gt; Ignition Switch
&gt; 15 - Positive Power to the Ignition Coil when switch is in the ON position
&gt; 30 - Positive Power Input
&gt; 50 - Momentary Switch for Positive Power to the Starter Solenoid
&gt; 
&gt; I stand by my statement that the most probable cause for your problem stems
&gt; from your headlight switch.

Power to the ignition does not go *through* the light switch. Why would he lose power 
to the ignition when he does not use the lights???? If I read the first post correct (I 
may have missed something :&gt;)) I thought the problem happened even with the lights off. 
If the engine died *only* when the lights were turned on, then I would agree with you 
without question. But...if his light switch was *SHORTING OUT*, his harness would 
burn-up being unfused. All the post reported was the engine dying.

Since it is easier IMHO to check a connection then change an ignition switch, I would 
run through everything else first!

&gt; P.S. Not a flame, hopefully a clarification! :)

Taken as good ideas! :&gt;)
