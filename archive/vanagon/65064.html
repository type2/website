Subject:      red led in temperature gauge

        Am I right in assuming that the red led gets its information
from the temperature gauge and does not have a sensor of its
own? I have an 82 Vanagon diesel.

        I switched from an 80 degrees Celsius thermostat to a 92
degrees Celsius (about 197 degrees F) thermostat for winter.
The gauge needle normally reads straight up, but now is within a
couple of millimeters of the right hand high temperature mark on
the gauge.  The red led has never come on, so I assume that the
motor is not too hot. Coolant has never boiled over or anything.
Am I playing Russian Roulette with the possibilities of overheating
the motor?
