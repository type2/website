Subject: Kelly Park VW show, valuable documents and sheetmetal

	Friends,
	This was an EXCELENT weekend for my bay-window single-cab.
Saturday, Ian and I went to Pick and Pull and got brake fluid resivior
parts and spares, and made a major find: The sheet-metal pannel that
covers the master-cylinder, handbrake cables, etc. My 69 came without
one, Ken's 71 came without one and my 70 pickup came without one, and
I can'r recall ever seeing one before, but I've got one now! $10!! 
Does anyone else not have one of these beauties for their T2? It does
a kinda-important job and in my experience, they're rare.
	When I get it cleaned up, I'll pull dimensions from it. Should
I look into having duplicates vaccuformed out of heavy PVC, or make
fibreglas replicas? Am I the only guy it really bothered to not have one?

	The Kelly Park VW show was amazing! Lots of cool, cool, busses,
including a split-window crew cab with Microbus roof windows (way too pretty)
and a 76 crewcab that appears to be a former Nato vehicle- now in 
primer, some body damage, guy drove it to the show, I should have gotten
his address. I heard a rumor that the asking price was $3K. If I haddn't
already started a project.... :-( sometimes it's better not to know. I
think I saw this transporter for sale in the early 80s in Marin County.
It's overall German Army Dark Olive Green, medium brown interior, primer
on the exterior surfaces. 
	Does anyone here know who owns this one?

	At the show I obtained a 1968 T2 illustrated parts book- basicly
the fiche in printed form, updated through late 1972. At some time in
the future, I could try making copies of it, but if anyone needs part
numbers or illustrations, I've got the material!

	We ran into one other Vanagon list member, and I'm sorry, I've
forgotten his name (he knew mine, and hailed me as I was going into
hypoglycemic shock and headed for the hot-dog line... I'm afraid
I wasn't very coherent, and I'm sorry. We found his synchro westy 
and trailer but he wasn't around. Never did see Bradley or Martha, or
the alledged videos of the Red Rock Trip... Some other time, I guess.

	I haven't made my NETSURFNUGEN tee shirt yet, so I could
only recognize and be recognized by people I've met at Martha's pot-luck
or the Big Sur trip.

	I hope your weekend was as good!
