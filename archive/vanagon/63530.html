&gt;Volks,
&gt;Anyone have a line on a starter for my new 82 Diesel Westy? Dealer wants
&gt;firstborn. Wife is tired of pushing/diesel fumes in hair.
&gt;Thank the Lord the List is up again!

    Is the Diesel starter completely unique to that model?  One would 
think that despite the unique bellhousing, a VW would have used the 
starter off of a Rabbit/Jetta/Golf.
