Subject: Insulation for a vanagon ...

Dear list members:

I have, while cleaning my 86 syncro, managed to remove all the
interior panels, the dash, and the headliner.  One thing led
to another...

Before I put it all back together, or maybe to avoid putting
it all back together, I've cooked up this ambition to attach
insulation to the roof, rear hatch, side panels and doors.  I
want to quiet the van and to make it more thermally efficient.

I'd really like some advice on what sort of insulation to use.
I want convenience and neatness of installation,  I want good
insulating properties (sound, and heat.)

I would very much appreciate some product recommendations and
any words of support/caution you might have for me.

Thanks!
