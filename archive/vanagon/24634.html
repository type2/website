Reply:

    Too bad the newer bus drivers are oblivious or slacking on the 
waving thing.  I started with older splitties and everyone waves, I 
kinda think there is also a mental link that cones from doing valves 
and removing trannys.

    Now I have a newer ev and I think waving is one of the coolest 
things about VDwdom ( say vee-dub-dom )

that is my six pesos.

&gt;&gt;I have stopped waving, noone usually notices.._dot_usually i flash my 
high beams
&gt;&gt;twice at oncoming busses of all types. and i have got a flash back 
from a
&gt;&gt;eurovan, and numerous vanagons but not too many breadloaves.. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*EVERY* breadloaf in the UK waves, flashes and generally goes mental 
at the 
&gt;sight of another. So do most other air-cooled VWs, especailly custom 
ones, 
&gt;and even quite a few people who are not even in cars. I don't think 
I've 
&gt;ever had a Vanagon driver wave though.
