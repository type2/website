On Sat, 14 Jan 95, Pat (&quot;Got any 12V stickers, man?&quot;) Walsh 
&lt;walshp_at_ippdsgi3.nawc-ad-indy.navy_dot_mil&gt; drooleth:
&gt; Wow!  What a score on that parts manual!  If you're taking requests, I'd
&gt; certainly appreciate a copy too.  It sounds chock full of the minutiae
&gt; detail-obsesive owner/restorers such as myself covet.  (&quot;Hi, my name is Pat
&gt; and I admit to laboriously peeling the interior stickers from Westys in
&gt; junkyards and to picking up used trim screws from junkers instead of using
&gt; &quot;newfangled&quot; unoriginal ones from the hardware store.&quot;)  I could give you a
&gt; copy of my '70 Westy manual (covers '71 too, I'm told), or volunteer to type
&gt; up a summary of the changes shown through the years as indicated in your
&gt; manual (for inclusion in the gopher).

I feel your pain, Pat.  Have you ever found yourself up to your neck in 
fire-ants, trying to remove a siezed do-dad from a rusting hulk in a 
tick-ridden junkyard, and said to yourself, &quot;God I LOVE these cars!!&quot;?

I'll pass the word when I get the copies made.
 &gt; 
&gt; &gt;But how could I have forgotten the curtains?  By the end of '71, you've 
&gt; &gt;lost those absolutely KILLER (sano, too, man) sliding-track curtains 
&gt; &gt;over the doors, to be replaced with a three-panel snap-on up front and a 
&gt; &gt;cheesy rod-and-pocket deal on the sliding door.  Oh pale echo of thy 

&gt; Hm.  My '71 has one GIANT curtain that covers the windshield and both cab
&gt; doors and snaps in place.  You're saying it should have tracks?  Even for

Pat's correct; I was being vague.  Herewith the particulars:

My book refers to two &quot;series&quot; of cars:

&quot;VW Campmobile 1968&quot;
8/1967 - 7/1968, Eqpt. SN 13001/1968 - 25000/1968
8/1968 - 7/1969, 00001/1969 - 18147/1969

&quot;VW Campmobile 1970&quot;
8/1969 - 7/1970, 0.00001 - 0.20755
8/1970 - 7/1971, 1.00001 - 1.25000
8/1971 - 7/1972, 2.00001 - (the book is dated 9/71)

[and you thought that Westy of yours was a '69, eh, newbie? :-) :-) BTW 
can someone compare these production numbers with other sources?]

&quot;The Serial Number of the Camping Equipment is shown on the 
Identification Plate mounted on the lower left part of the rear seat.&quot;

OK, in the period covered by this manual there were 3 changes to the 
Westy curtains:
1. beginning in 8/70 (no SN given), the driver-compartment curtain 
arrangement goes to the one-piece deal Pat describes above, PN 231 069 
445, in case you want to check the dealer's parts counter.  You'll also 
need 6 Druckknopf-Kugel (snaps), PN 231-067-654.  At that time there are 
part-number changes to some of the other curtains, but no apparent visual 
change.
2. beginning in 11/70 (equipt# 1.08 449), there are plastic straps to hold 
the rear curtains open.  That's what it says.  My '68 Westy had 'em, 
but they might have been added.
3. beginning in 8/71 (200 625), the sliding-door curtain gets the 
rod-n-pocket treatment.

Bee korrect!  When scrounging curtains for my '68 in junkyards, I came 
across many variations.  Check the VIN.

Inny kwustyuns?
