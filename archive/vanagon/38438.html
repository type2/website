Hey all,
I bought the Haynes manual today, and as I'm casually reading through
the chapter on brakes, wheels, and &quot;tyres,&quot; :) I notice that the manual
says:  &quot;Export models, particularly to the USA, are fitted with
self-adjusting rear brakes.&quot;  Now, I thought that you had to adjust the
rear brakes on buses (mine's a '78).  Is Haynes right or what?

Sean
