Says Everett Barnes:

&gt; I found out today that Gerber lost a lawsuit because they advertised
&gt; that their food was all natural and when taken to court it came out
&gt; that they had used preservatives.

Found out?  Ah, Everett, you need an epistemological tune-up.  I
thought this had the earmarks of an urban legend, so I did some
tedious, in-depth research by typing www.gerber_dot_com into my browser's
address window.  What does it say in big print? &quot;Misinformation About
Baby Food Settlement.&quot;

http://www.gerber_dot_com/story/newshome.html

It's a pretty cool website, BTW.

Also, though it's arduous and time consuming, typing the phrase
&quot;gerber lawsuit&quot; into a search engine form yields interesting hits
with the words &quot;scam&quot;, &quot;urban legend&quot;, &quot;chain letter&quot;, and &quot;ripoff&quot;
in their titles.

Would that others had the time, dedication, and perseverance to
research rumors in such depth before crossposting them to
everyone_at_internet_dot_net....
