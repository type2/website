Subject: ignition conversions

hi-
        Has anyone tried those electronic ignition conversion kits? I was
thinking about switching if they are comparable to mechanical ignition
systems.
(since it would be more convenient) Also, does anyone know of a company
that sells complete front end rebuild kits.I have seen them for american
cars but not for VW. Thanks in advance for any info.

Regards,
Dave
