Hey all,
	After a long delay in receiving mail from vanagon_at_lenti, my
	mailbox was filled this morning with 96 messages.  Anyway,
	thanks to everybody who helped with the a/c question I had.  I
	was afraid I was gonna have to take that fan off, but at least
	it doesn't sound too hard.  It has also been suggested that my
	electrical goofiness is caused by a bad ground on the right
	taillight assembly.  I will investigate this today and report
	the results.  I hope it's that simple buy I'm afraid that it
	won't be.  Also, my right rear side marker light doesn't work
	and I can't figure it out:  bulb is good, connections are good
	(they were corroded and nasty but I put new connectors on there
	and now they're OK) and for some reason it just don't work.
	Does this side marker light share the same ground as the
	taillight assembly?  If so then maybe the ground is messed up.

	Yesterday I replaced the hazard flasher switch because it was
	also causing electrical goofiness.  The turns signals wouldn't
	work unless you wiggled the hazard swtich and then they were
	unreliable.  So, went to a junkyard and got the switch off a '73
	for $5.00.  Went home, plugged it in and PRESTO! good turn
	signals.  Weird thing, tho, the '78 swtich has one more
	connection than the '73 does.  It's right in the top center of
	the switch.  Well, I taped the wire off under the dash and the
	thing seems to work without it so I don't know what it was for.

	I will report on the electrical goofiness later today.

	Thanks everybody,
	Sean
