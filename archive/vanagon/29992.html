To Joel and the list:

I notice there are now 13 1967 Type II's.  Was Grendel #13?  (It certainly
fits her character).

I pulled Grendel's tranny this afternoon, started scraping the crud from the
frame.  Lotsa crud.

It looks like I'm going to have to section the left-rear from the hatch clear
around to the louvers, and as high as the mid-line seam in order to cut the
stub frame free so I can straighten it.  That means pulling the spare tire
well and interior panel to get at the mid-line seam.  I'll cross-brace with
struts &amp; bondo before I cut, try to keep things from flapping all over.
