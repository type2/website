 Hi there,

 This is small problem but it's bugging me.  I've noticed a few loose sheet
 metal screws/fasteners have either come loose or have at least lost their
 &quot;purchase&quot;.  Specifically, some interior screws that attach the curtains to
 the window frames are stripped in my '85 Westfalia.  Should I replace with
 over-sized screws or is there something like LockTite that can be used to
 make these fasteners secure?  Any ideas would be appreciated.

 Thanks much, Marty

A trick I've used often is to take a paper clip and bend a little U on the
end of it.  Snip this little bugger off and slide it into the hole, one leg
of the U on the front side and one leg on the back side, get it?  Then run
your sheet metal screw back in, should be nice and tight.

Good Luck

Carl Turner
