I got a '93 EV a few months ago but they told me they had scrounged 
around the country to get that one (do I believe them? not really since 
nothing else they told me was true.)  I have seen no other EVs at any of 
the four dealers i've been by in the area except the Winnehahas.  They 
looked like nothing special - I liked the Westy Buses better.
