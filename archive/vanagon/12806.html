Subject:      for robert brown: borla exhausts (stainless steel)

and also for all vanagons ...

robert was looking for a non-dealer exhaust system, and i recalled that i
had called Borla (Oxnard, California) (805) 986-8600  a while back and the
fellow said he had an 84 vanagon and was trying to get the company to make
the vanagon exhaust system.

so i called (once i got the above now-correct number) and talked to Tim,
in Tech Support. he said they did NOT make anything for the vanagons (water
or air-cooled) right now, BUT &lt;drum-rolllllllll&gt; IF anybody orders 20 or more
of them, they WILL make them. said it would take about six weeks to get the
specs, gear up, and fit it into the schedule.  the 20 units is the minimum
order for special stuff.

as i recall, the price quoted to me was about $200 for the muffler (while the
dealer is about $500 retail), so we are talking about $4000 minimum order
(depending on what Borla decides the price would be).

so ... are there 20 or more of you out there that need mufflers (or other
exhaust parts)? he said it didn't matter whether it was air-cooled or water-
cooled (and the 1978-79 buses ought to be able to use the 1980-1983 vanagon
stuff) ... as long as there were 20 units ordered. i'm assuming there might
need to be 20 air-cools and 20 20 water-cools (i don't think the two would
be able to use the same mufflers/etc).

anybody want to take this hot potato? :)
