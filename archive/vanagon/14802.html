&gt; &gt; IS THERE ANY INTEREST IN AN EASTERN LEG?
&gt; Iagree, that we should all try to meet in St. Louis, and then go
&gt; traipsing about the east coast. Perhaps if we could all get together and
&gt; figure something out. I for one can suggest perhaps driving/camping the
&gt; Blue Ridge Parkway, or perhaps the Outer Banks...

Exactly, good idea in fact, the later we start the better for me, if we
were to do St Louis first at the end of the western peoples leg, then
reverse my proposed order all the better, in fact this way if a few of
the wackier die hard westerners wanted to continue on with us instead of
going back home they would be welcome to do so, so how are we going to
keep in touch with the list people who don't go, anyone looked into the
use of modems with cell phones ($$$) just kidding.
