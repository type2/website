Subject: A Toast (or two)

Greetings All,

I'd like to propose a toast so that on New Years Eve or
Day, however you prefer, everyone on this list can raise
their glasses and drink to the fine people on this list.
Yes, I know it will be a New Year for each time zone, but
it's the sentiment that counts.

The following people(s) are those I want to raise a special
toast to:

(Please feel free to add/append more toasts)

I'd like to raise a toast to Gerry Skerbitz, for pulling this
list together and putting up with all the nonsense that goes
along with maintaining the list.  I really want to thank you
for keepin' the list in line/on line and allowing all of us
to communicate in this forum without which, all of this would
not be possible.  Cheers! to you Gerry!

I'd like to raise a toast to John Ritchie, for being such a
great host to Linda and I during our trip and for the fine
dining and hospitality he bestowed on us.  (Best Wishes John)

I'd like to raise a toast to Ric Golen, for being so knowledgable
about the older VWs and the history behind it all and putting
up with the harrassment and B.S. we give him.  Especially about
the Eurovan.  May your wheels be good to you wherever they take
you.  Also thanks for the play by play story of the resurrection
of your '56 bug.  I really enjoyed it and am glad you are of
the stock purists when it comes to restoration.  

I'd like to raise a toast to Martha Rubin for taking on putting
together the West Coast gathering and for starting and co-
coordinating the North American Tour (or whatever it's called
now) and for putting up with our flannel teasing and keeping our 
excessive testosterone prone sides to a minimum. ;)  I can't wait 
for the trip!

I'd like to raise a toast to David Schwarz for also co-coordinating
the North American Tour and the logistics planning.  You still
have alot to do man.  Let me know if I can help.  I just hope
that I can go when we do it.

I'd like to raise a toast to all of you who ask great questions
that maybe I should have asked but really learn alot when the
answers come in.

I'd like to raise a toast to those of you with the answers that
help those of us that haven't put in the time for some reason
or another.  You've helped me to an incredible degree to understand
what's what in my beastie and other beasties for that matter.
Thank you so very much for this knowledge.

I'd like to raise a toast to Thom Fitzpatrick for his on going
stories of the '56 bus mission.  It is a real inspiration to
hear and learn about the nitty-gritty how-to's and frustrations
of body restoration.

And if yer still standing after gulpin' down all that alcohol 
after all those toasts.......

Lastly, I'd like to raise a toast to the man who made it really all 
happen (although I'm probably vastly underestimating Gerry's part 
because I really don't know what all went on behind the scenes) and 
takes the time either because his job is so pathetically easy/boring 
that he literally gets paid to keep track of VW stuff. ;) ;) ;)
I think ya'll know who I'm talkin' about.  That chicken pluckin'-
hog callin' - grit chompin' - down home nudist seminarin' - Nyuk'-
Nyuk'-Nyukin' (Unka) Joel Walker!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you 
for co-coordinating with Gerry to get this crazy fun group together
and for all of the factual technically information gathering/dis-
tributing and helping with the real problems that go on with
Vanagons, Buses and Kombi's.  Some day I'm gonna make it down there
and really clink glasses with ya and have a good long chat.  And
after ya wake up from it, you'll wonder if it was just all a bad
dream for the rest of your life.  ;)

And if yer ssthill ssthtanding (hic) ......

You should all raise a toast to all the members of this group, cause
I just know I left somebody out and I'm sure I'll hear about it.
A Big Cheers! to all of you for all your help, fun and kindness and
friendship.  Please have a safe good patient New Year, so that we can 
all raise fun and havoc next year on this list.

Happy Holidays to All!  

Steven
