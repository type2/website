WE WON WE WON WE WON...

Ok, so friday night, it was school dance night...the
collective net.wisdom was..

1) Get a yugo and *really* embarrass him (The Joel theory)
2) Walk
3) Drown him in a bucket { my wife said no :-(  }
4) Tough noogies
5) &quot;Gee, my kids really love the bus&quot;

So, being the butthead I am, of course, his carriage
to the dance was NuBus... (I don't think anybody 
encouraged me to take him in a different car)

On the way home, I asked him about the reactions to
NuBus... He *admitted* that the &quot;girls&quot; really loved the bus.
They asked all about it, and his quote from one was

   &quot;I'd give anything to drive one&quot;

So, he still won't admit liking it, but he admits
it has a certain appeal to the 14 year old girl crowd.

Of course, this may spell the labelling of our hobby
as &quot;just one of those kid-fads...&quot;
