&gt;:(  i'm in my bus and waved at a vanagon camper yesterday; flashed my lights
&gt;and waved like crazy:
&gt;
&gt;i got a slight movement of the wrist in return.  :(

Was it anything like the full extension of the third finger?

When our street got completely flooded last winter, I set up a sign
at my house and stood out there trying to keep people from enterin (cause
the make a big traffic jam where the road dips and creates a river) and
one guy flying by in a 4x4 flipped my off and kept going.  A few hours later
he was able to get a buddy to come pull him out, and his truck sat in front
of my house for a day or so until he got a tow truck to come get it...
