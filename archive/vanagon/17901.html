&gt; went bad, all at about the same time.  They suck, Bosch sucks, I will never
&gt; use them again, I will always carry spare plugs, right there with the fan
&gt; belt, etc.

Hey, hey now we are all glad she's back on the road but is
Bosch really that bad?  I'd say more likely while tuning up
that custom f.i. it went real rich a few times and terminated
the plugs, frankly every VW I've ever owned has used Bosch only
and I really think Platinums were the reason for my major mileage
increase in my old '76, I'll still swear by them, maybe a
slightly hotter plug would not come amiss BTW, but if the $.97
AC or Champions or whatever work, keep with em.
