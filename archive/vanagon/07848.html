Subject: Locking engine compartment latch?

Hi gang,

Has anyone seen/made/bought a locking latch for the engine compartment 
lid on bread loaves?  Everywhere I look, it's just an unlocked button 
latch.  The mechanism appears to be significantly different (p &lt; 0.05)  :) 
than the mechanism for the big rear lid into the passenger compartment, so a 
simple swap is out, right?  This open engine compartment seems like a 
security risk to me, leaving the engine open for tampering, and running a 
risk of theft for the battery, tire chains, and other junk squirreled 
away back there.  

What (if anything) have you folks in Netland done about this?  I'd feel 
better not leaving my engine compartment unlocked.

Tobin
