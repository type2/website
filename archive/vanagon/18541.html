Subject: Re: Performance Decisions


_at__at_I put this to you::::::: Ramona and I are about to embark on a
_at__at_cross-country voyage to Colorado where we will live in rust-free 
_at__at_harmony for
_at__at_the immediate future. Ramona needs upgrading before the onset of serious
_at__at_travel and I've obtained a Bus Stop catalog from Rocky Mtn. Motorworks. Is
_at__at_this a good co. to deal with? (I realize I just opened up a can of worms
_at__at_there...) In shopping for a new long-block engine, how do theirs compare to
_at__at_others? The two choices I have are the stock 1600cc remanufactured and the
_at__at_&quot;high performance&quot; 1641cc 

I agree with an earlier post whic sez that the 1600 _will_ run cooler.  
My FLARS suggested this.  I run my '70 with a 1600DP in the mountains 
here and in Colorado--runs fine, albeit slowly.  It's basically a stock 
rebuild, done by the FLARS.  I see a lot of scenery via the turnouts 
alongside the road--to let the hurried tourists by.  

_at__at_I wanna be sure she'll have enough power to
_at__at_tow a small trailer and my camping gear. 

Tough, but possible.  Can you afford any kind of high performance mods, 
like the heavy duty parts (aforementioned, in Eug's msg.)?  I've had mine 
loaded to the gills and it performed OK (_at_ 20MPH up a 12,000ft pass).  

_at__at_Also, how do I check to see if my
_at__at_oil cooler is in good shape? Engine out?? How does one tell if it's shot?

Your FLARS should be able to &quot;tank&quot; that part--or order a new one if/when 
you mail-order yer motor.  St. Muir has a mini-procedure on that (?)

Hope this is of help--good luck!
