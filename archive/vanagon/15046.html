Subject: WTB: VW engine

I'd like to buy a used 1600 dual-port long block or complete engine.
I'm in San Diego, and can drive quite a ways to pick it up. Anybody 
have either a decent one in good shape, or a runout that needs
rebuilding? Preferably in the Southern California area.

Larger displacements also considered, if in good running condition!
