Subject: Need Price info on Clean '83 Westie with 76K Miles

Hi all. 

I've got a friend who wants &quot;in&quot; to the Westie game and has been
scouting for a while. He spotted an '83 with 76K miles, good shape,
summer car, no rust (repainted), fridge, stove, aux heater. The PO
claims no problems. He is asking $7900.

Price sources that I have consulted only go back to '87. Anybody have 
any info on a fair price for this vehicle? Anyone bought or sold one
around that year recently?

Also, is he likely to have head gasket problems in the near future? Are
there any other potential hazards to be aware of?

TIA!

-Steve
