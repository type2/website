Subject: More Turbo Diesel Questions


        As I am very slowly piecing the parts together for my Quantum TD
engine into my diesel vanagon operation (surgery is still at least six to
ten months away).  Aside from finding that I will need a different
transmission, I am wondering if anyone has the part # for the exaust pipe
that will go from the turbo to the muffler, or will this part need to be
made localy?
