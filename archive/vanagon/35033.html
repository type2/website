Subject: CIS updates 

Hi volks,
  Just wanted to let everyone know, if you care, that I've got my CIS
straitened out. Finnally!  After having a  O2 sensor hole drilled into my
manifold and installing the new sensor, it works great.  I had to make a
couple of adjustments to the fuel distributor and idle mixture screw, but
everythings working great.  THe Vanagon runs great no skipping and power
almost better than before.  Should be considering that I just about
replaced every FI component and ignition part on the vehicle.  I didn't
realize how important an O2 sensor could be.  But the Shelock Holmes
says:'Eliminate the improbable and whats left must be the problem.'  Well,
if he had a VW I'm sure he would have said that.=) Thanks for everyones
help.  Take care, see you on 'The Undernet' channel Volkswagen this Friday.
