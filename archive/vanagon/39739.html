Oh, it could be, especially if the person asking it is a Catholic Priest 
from Rhode Island, Michael Jackson, or hell a perverted, pot-smoking Dead 
Head with a VW Van....

&gt; I enjoy a good joke as much as the next person

Oh, you do, eh? Sort of the way you enjoyed the little &quot;fun~ about the 
Garcia List stickers? Or your resulting diatribe?


Get over yourself, please! If you want a 100% serious, politically correct 
list, this isn't it. After all a lot of us are aging pot smoking hippies 
(who by definition aren't serious) who listen to the Dead and hang out in 
our VW vans....the only difference between what we were years ago, and who 
we are today is that we sit in our vans, joints hanging from our lips, and a 
lap top attached to our cell phones....

DISCLAIMER FOR THE HUMOR IMPAIRED: The above paragraph was meant as 
sarcasm/humor. If you humor sensor is set on &quot;narrow&quot;, it will not pick up 
on the above fact.
