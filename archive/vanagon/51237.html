Subject: '83.5 running too COOL??
Date: Sun, 3 Nov 1996 09:13:31 -0500

OK, I never thought I'd post this question...

Is my 83.5 wasserboxer running too cool??

It's just starting to get cold here in Cincinnati, Ohio (in the twenties)
and my bus is running with the guage at 1/4 and idling still at under 1/2.
The heat generated with fan on full blast is ok for now, but I'm dreading
the 0 degree weather :(

Some background... I replaced the head gaskets early summer and all has
been fine since. Guage ran at 1/2  (+/- a little) on the highway at 65mph
for extended runs (300 to 600 miles), idles at  1/2 to 3/4 then fan kicks
on and goes back down, and so on, and so on... These are all throughout
80-90 degree weather btw.

So, is this normal? If so, any ideas to get more heat? If not, any
solutions? Can this damage the engine? etc...

thanks!
