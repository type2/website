Boy, do I feel STUPID, hangin' around with you guys/gals on this list who
know how to rebuild from the ground up - and me with 8 engines into my 81
Westy by a series of hired mechanics.  I'm almost tempted to try my own
rebuild.  But, experience tells me that without some training, or a
knowledgable partner, ya can sure screw up an engine in a hurry.  Like my
high school buddy's Ford, when he forgot to take out the expander rings
before pushing his new rebuild downhill to start it.  Or, the 61 Corvette
he rebuilt and then could never balance, or my own stupid mistakes on the
81s first engine.

So, if ya'll don't mind I'll lurk here for awhile, hoping to pick up tips,
and hoping my new rebuild outlasts the warranty for a change.

By the way, Felix (new name for 81 - like it? - only 9 lives) is close to
his 500 mi. check up and runs like a cat!  Only problem is engine missing
at start up until warmed up.  Hesitates, and sometimes stops, but has good
power otherwise.  Does it also after driving, then sitting, then restarting
after an hour or so.  Any suggestions?  Is this an easy fix, or is my
friendly mechanic gonna suggest a new computer or some such?

Thanks, Nirvanagonians.
