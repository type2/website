Subject: Re: Can transmisson be rebuilt?

This is not the 23 window model.  I wish that it were.  I need to drive the
400 mi to look at it, but the owner is sending me pictures.  The pics may be
in the mail today.

The owner says that he pulled a car with the bus and the transmission locked
up. 
He put it on jack stands. The drivers side wheel turns, but the passenger
side wheel won't turn.  I guess that this could be a lock up of the entire
engine, and he just thinks it is the transmission.  He thinks it has a
tunnel transmission.
