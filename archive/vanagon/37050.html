Subject: Re: MIG welder advice needed

A friend of mine bought the Harbor Freight 140, 8 years ago.  I bought the
same one 5 years ago, I would have been leary were it not for the fact that
he was happy with his (he uses it weekly).  I certainly have no complaints
about my MIG.  A work associate, who used to weld professionally, makes
comments here and there about what a bad welder it is, but he always comes
back to borrow it again.  Bottom Line: the HF welder is good, but if you want
to spend the money there are better ones available.

Don't underestimate the other costs, before you can weld.  The MIG is less
than half the cost.  Tank, Mask, Gloves, leather, misc sprays, tips, torch
ends, valves, electric breaker, 6-3 wire, outlet(s), 6-3 extension cords,
welding wire......
