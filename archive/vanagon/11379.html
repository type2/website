     &gt;The 44 BHP is mechanical energy.  The difference between that and the

     &gt;what the engine generates as heat, which is most of the energy in the 
     &gt;gasoline.  I don't remember the exact figures for the efficiency of 
     &gt;an internal combustion engine off the top of my head, but it's 
     &gt;somewhere around 25%.  We gotta capture that other 75% somehow, guys, 
     &gt;and dump it into the cab and we'll be warm as toast.  :-)
     
     I was taking to a friend last night (who did Mechanical Engineering) 
     and he confirmed that the internal combustion engine is about 40% 
     efficient on a good day which gives us about 70 HP lost in heat etc. 
     that's about 50,000 watts, wow.
