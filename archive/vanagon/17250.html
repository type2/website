Subject: Speaking of CB Antennas......


There is absolutely no place (IMHO) on a EuroVan to mount a CB
antenna without drilling some serious type holes which I really
don't feel like doing. To that end, two years ago I purchased
one of those &quot;pseudo-cellphone&quot; window mount antennas. It works
ok with the weatherband part of my CB set, some what marginal
in reception...and really crappy on the transmission end...

So I am about to replace it, and I'm wondering if anyone out there
has had any experience with those &quot;black boxes&quot; that are supposed
to allow the radio antenna to be used as a CB antenna? Or am I
doomed to drilling some holes?
