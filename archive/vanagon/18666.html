Subject: Re: noise from wheel well

Sami,

Could still be the CV's, checking the boot or even dismantling the CV and inspecting
can't guarantee that they are OK (or so it seemed for my '73 Kombi)
The thing about the noise disappearing after jacking up the van seems to
tie in with this too, this happened to me, noise just vanished, don't know why 
exactly, Joel had some theories though....
I replaced the offending CV's and haven't had a problem since, also repacked the
rest whilst playing with that horrible goo that CV's seem to like.

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; maybe someone can help. For a while, I've been hearing a clicking sound
&gt; from one of the wheels (my guess: right rear), very much like a
&gt; chronometer. It goes faster when the bus goes faster, independently of
&gt; engine rpm; so it's not the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, on the GNATT trip (of course, right after Joel had left us), another
&gt; much worse sounding clunking noise started to haunt the bus. I think it
&gt; was coming from the same rear-right wheel, but I'm not certain. First it
&gt; happened when the bus was coasting, later when it was under load (going up
&gt; hills in third gear). So, we all stopped and looked. The Schwarzmeister
&gt; helped me take off the right rear wheel and do some casual checking, i.e.,
&gt; turning the axle by hand, checking the CV boots, but we couldn't find
&gt; anything. Put the wheel back and repeated the process on the other side.
&gt; Still nothing. We decided to just keep on going, David riding with me, so
&gt; he could hear the noise and judge for himself. Of course, the noise had
&gt; *completely* disappeared by then. 
&gt; 
&gt; The next day, the Gnatters veered off to the West and Maria, the bus and I
&gt; continued towards St.Paul, Minnesota (home of lenti.med :) ), drove
&gt; another 1,000 + miles through Wisconsin and back to Missouri, without a
&gt; problem and without any noise from the wheels.... up until 5 miles from
&gt; home. Torrential rains caused an accident on hwy 64 and I had to hit the
&gt; brakes hard. Upon this the loud clunking resumed, the vacation was over,
&gt; and darkness set in. :I
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions? Thanks!
