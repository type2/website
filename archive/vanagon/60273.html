Subject: Re: Westfalia Questions

&gt;     1. Was there ever any factory or dealer option to put an additional 
&gt;     single seat in the Westfalia in proximity to the sliding door?  I can 
&gt;     see how it might be done with an extra front seet, swivel plate, and a 
&gt;     purpose-made pedestal.

I have been down this road before.  There are two VW options. The first is
to acquire a folding &quot;theatre&quot; style seat from a Wolfsburg model.  This
seat would go back to back with the passenger seat.  The second option is a
single seat which was sold as an option.  It is described and pictured in
the owners manual if you have it.  It attaches to the floor in grooves
found under the carpet.  

There is a multitude of information on this subject to be found in the
archives.  Let me know if you are having trouble finding them and I will
forward the messages to you.

&gt;     
&gt;     2. Anyone know of a source for 1991 Westfalia dealer brochures?

I have one.  I won't part with it but I will copy it if that will work for
you.  Let me know.
