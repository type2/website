Subject: Repost &amp; Update on Vanagon Seats

Hello everyone

This message is for those that are interested in the Vanagon
two person bench seats that MediVan has available.  They are
located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.

These seats were taken out before putting their 40 Vanagons
into service so they are in new condition.  The price has been
established at $100 each by MediVan.

It has been difficult to find the time to inventory whats' available,
since they are in storage and are difficult to get at.  Here's what
appears to me to be available;

Grey fabric of the 87, 88, 90 &amp; 91 style
Blue fabric of the 87, 88, 90 &amp; 91 style
Brown fabric of the 84 &amp; 85 style (non-Wolfsburg)
Maybe blue fabric of the 84 &amp; 85 style (non-Wolfsburg)
Grey fabric of the 89 Wolfsburg style

For those who have responded and are still interested, please
e-mail your addresses so we can determine the shipping cost and
get back to you.

There are still seats available for those who might not have
responded.  Please indicate a second choice if you are open to that.

Watch for another update shortly !
