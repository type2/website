Subject: Re: Road sign interpretations


&gt;&gt;My favourite recent signage is one that we spotted on the way to Sequoia
&gt;&gt;National Park, near Visalia. The sign is huge and has the words &quot;Left Wing
&gt;&gt;Liberals&quot; with the red circle and slash through it. Perhaps right wing
&gt;&gt;liberals and middle of the road liberals are still ok?
&gt;
&gt;Well, no. But we're patient... one thing at a time.   :)


The ones in the middle of the road, are easier to hit!   :^)
