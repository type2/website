Subject: Porsche engines

Sami Dakhlia inquires about availability and longevity of Porsche engines.
Most traffic in Porsche engines is by word of mouth and by ads in the Porsche
club magazine, Porsche Panorama.  There are many good Porsche &quot;dismantlers&quot;
(when parts cost a lot you don't say wrecking yard, I guess).  Complete run-
ning engines typically run $3000 and up.  I paid $1500 for a 71 engine with
a new valve job on the heads, but only the bottom end was assembled.  I had
to mount the heads, cams, and induction system.

Cheapest engines are in the 74-77 range; their longevity is suspect because
few of them got past 60k miles without needing at least top end overhaul and
often more.  Before and after that range, 120-150kmiles is possible with
regular oil changes and valve adjustments and nothing else.  Longevity is 
probably very similar to a 74 van engine.  That is, it depends hugely on the
way the car is driven and maintained.  Also random factors.

If you contemplate an engine swap and are not equipped/experienced enough to
do it yourself, my recommendation would be to find a shop you trust first, and
let them do the shopping after discussing your price range with you.  They may
well have contacts, and their personal knowledge of those contacts is price-
less.  The best situation to find, if you can afford it, is a well-maintained
78-80 3.0 liter engine that is being removed, still healthly, to be replaced
by a 3.2 or Turbo engine.  Such an engine might go for $4000 complete and have
50,000 troublefree miles in it before it needs anything.

Read Bruce Anderson's book on 911s, and get hand-me-down copies of Porsche
Panorama, before you do anything expensive.  The Porsche engines are bizarrely
expensive compared to VW or American iron.  The only saving grace is that they
hold their value well even as parts.

As always, your mileage may vary.
