Subject: Bug Trajedy in the making
Date: Wed, 1 Feb 1995 09:49:57 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

I was at Pull 'n' Save in Rancho Cordova last weekend, and I saw a '55 (?)
Oval window bug they were cleaning  up to sell.

The trajedy is that they were taking all of the original doors and lids
off to put on &quot;nicer&quot; but incorrect ones on!!!!  The originals were right
there,a nd really were not in that bad of shape, just a little scratched
and bumpy!  I image these parts are impossible to find, and they'll 
prolly go on the scrap heap when they're done!

There didn't appear to be hardly any rust on it, except for the new hood, 
which was covered with surface rust.

They are asking $750, and I woulda bought it if I'd had the cash, but I would
have insisted on having the original doors, fenders, and W decklid back on!
You could prolly get it for $500 or so!

It also had what looked like a 1600 or so motoro in it.

Someone please save this car!  Its at Pull 'n' Save in Rancho Cordova, CA.

Thom
