Subject: Synchro engines.

Hi,
	(This is following on from a conversation with a friend of mine
about buying vehicles in South Africa for overland trips.)
 Were synchro drivetrains available with aircooled engines or were they
only introduced after the changeover to waterboxers?
 For our South African readers (or others who know, of course): what engine
options are available on (used) synchros in South Africa?
Cheers,
	W.
