    &gt; One trick to overcoming the mean head and side winds is to find a Big
    &gt; 18 wheeler going the speed you want to go and tailgate him.
    
    In my more youthful days, I got a ticket for &quot;following too closely&quot;
    for doing this particular action.
    
    I hear that the &quot;following too closely&quot; ticket is pretty hard to get.
    I was driving a '71 at the time, and told the cop the truth, that I 
    was trying to save some gas.  This happened in I-5 south of Mt. Vernon,
    Washington, in 1982 (?).  Don't know if the cops are still so anal.

uh, i learned this from my dad ('63 camper)
and in my experience the truckers hate and
will scrape you off somehow.  only once was
it real meanness (last minute lane change around 
construction).

does work real well, though.
