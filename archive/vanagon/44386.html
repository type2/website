Volks,

Perhaps some of you may remember my saga, I was whacked hit &amp; run in my =
very good condition '71 westy.  For the past nine months I've looked in =
for a replacement, only to find that the '71 westy is becoming a rare =
find.

A few days ago I found what I thought was 'the one', a scissors-top '71 =
in very good condition, but with an engine that had 50K on it and the =
owner wanted what might be considered the full market $2500.  I offered =
$1750, downgrading his engine, front-end and body a bit.  He wouldn't =
take it.  I have been hoping to pick up a scissors-top, both for the =
upstairs sleeping space, and to have the roof storage forward so the =
back end doesn't end up so heavily loaded on big trips.

The day before yesterday I went for a swim at Lake Anza, first time this =
year.  I pulled into a parking space next to a guy in flashy swim =
trunks.  His first comment as I got out was &quot;Still running eh?,&quot;  =
noticing the tremendously smashed in left rear corner.  I said &quot;yep&quot; and =
we talked a bit.  He mentioned that he has, yo, a '71 westy with a blown =
motor that he's been sitting on, wondering what to do.  I expressed my =
interest and we set a date to check it out.  His friend had just been =
cited by the police for nudity because he was changing his swim trunks =
behind his car in the parking lot!

Next evening I see the bus.  Dirty white, cracked windshield, but this =
guy had put almost as much liquid money into this thing as I had into =
mine.  When I looked at the engine I couldn't believe it, the full on 48 =
IDA webers, steel braided oil lines, he didn't build it, but it has to =
be big, and blown of course.  The dash has full instrumentation, big =
tach, oil temp &amp; pressure right where I have mine.  Gas shocks, Michelin =
XZX's less then a year old.  Even has a stereo with big speakers in the =
doors!  More rust than mine, front floor shot, lot's of blistering =
around the windshield, etc.

How much?  This is a nice guy went through too much with someone else =
trying to put a trick engine in, must've spent $4000+.  He says, &quot;Any =
offer,&quot; I say, &quot;You mean like $300?&quot;  &quot;Sure.&quot;  Sold.  I guess he figured =
it was going to a nice home.  He's right.

So I'm back to VW project land, maybe not right away, but certainly over =
the summer.  As long as I don't spend too much time reading and writing =
on this list I should have it running and roadworthy more sooner than =
later.

I'm planning on taking the whacked bus up to the Vallejo swap meet on =
June 23rd and sell it 'as is' after stripping the best for the white =
bus.  I'll fill it with any VW paraphernalia I have left over, including =
those 48 IDA's, and sell as much as possible.  Maybe see some of ya'all =
there?

So, Joel, change the stats. Eugene has returned to the list with two '71 =
westies.  Later it'll go back to one.

Gee, which engine should I put in?  I have new thoughts about VW valve =
trains which I'll babble about later.  First I have to pass smog with =
both buses so......

Eug,

PS anybody know how to import a Eudora address book into MS Exchange?
