Subject: greasing rear wheel bearings

My '71's rear wheels need greasing.  Has anyone out there done this job.
Is it fairly straight forward or is getting to the inside bearing a pain?
According to the manual I need a special puller to press the axle shaft
out of the bearings and bearing housing...is that right?

Any comments would be appreciated.

Martin                ps. I'm still waiting for more comments 
                          on the quietest muffler...stock vs others
