Malcolm,

Thanks for your posting.  I enjoyed the spark plug wear story.  I had not 
heard of that, but I have had other similar experiences with other parts.

I am unhappy to hear that Bob may not be posting because of some whiners on 
the list.  I just thought that it was because he had nothing to say to us 
water cooled owners since his experience lies with air cooled.

I don't subscribe to the air cooled list these days, but I have noticed a 
considerably different flavor to the water cooled list since the split. 
 Bob once irritated me by saying that water cooled owners didn't work as 
much on their busses and I inferred that he meant that therefore they 
weren't as worthwhile as people because of this.  I tried to defend us by 
saying that we worked on things differently because of the higher 
electronic content, and other changes present in our newer buses.

Well, I must admit that perhaps he was right.  On the combined list there 
were enough kindly experts that when someone said something out of 
ignorance, it was responded to with many gentle corrections.  Now I see the 
honest ignorance responded to with flames and nonsense.  More and more 
technical responses are going directly to the participants, rather than to 
the list, so there is less sharing.  Perhaps this is because of the 
complaints about &quot;too much traffic.&quot;  Well, in my case I'd just as soon see 
all of the responses ... perhaps I might learn something.  As long as the 
subject is somewhat to the point, I can use the delete key just like anyone 
else.

Well, if the whiners have intimidated Bob, then they have dealt the 
majority of us list members a blow.  Bob was a tremendous resource to this 
list and we should not allow the whiners to hurt us by driving him away.

Mike
