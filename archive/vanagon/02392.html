Subject: This Friday's Song....


My creative juices are a bit stymied at this time (Stymie...wasn't he
one of the Little Rascalls?)...but in view of my suggestion that
Martha pose in a thong bikini thingie in front of her vanagon for
VW T&amp;A, and her offer of wearing flannel....could someone come
up with a song using the Beatle's &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;? 

You remember the one off of the &quot;White Album&quot;....you do remember
the White Album don't you....the one where if you applied heat
to the cover, it was supposed to reveal a nude picture of 
John and Yoko....ok, admit it howmany of you out there actually
tried to see if the picture was there?  Arrrgg.._dot_can you imagine
Yoko Ono in the nude!!!! Hell, I'd rather see Martha in flannel!!!


Got to get coffee...coffeee...coffeeeeee....
