&gt; My '78 (Murray) is braking rather irregularly these days. After long

&gt; close to the floor without producing much stopping power. The problem
&gt; is resolved after a pump or two when brake pressure is returned. I
&gt; thought at first that I had some air in the brake lines, so I bled them
&gt; without any favourable results (no significant air bubbles produced).
&gt; Next Bentley says that these conditions could be caused by the rear
&gt; shoes being out of adjustment. After adjustment everything worked great
&gt; for a few weeks. Now the problem is gradually returning. The lack of
&gt; pressure on first stomp of the brake pedal is very noticeable when
&gt; driving on rough roads i.e., gravel logging roads. On the rough surface
&gt; (very dusty too) the pedal will often bottom out without significant
&gt; braking effect. A couple pumps on the pedal produces the desired effect
&gt; (slowing down!).
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas? Do I need to adjust the rear shoes again?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any advice!

Well, this will be a typically fast 'net reply...NOT!!  Interesting 
question, freaky problem, so I thought I'd try to get this thread rolling.

Mark, have you been losing brake fluid?  Any wetness anywhwere in the 
braking system that might indicate a leak in the system?  Wheel 
cylinders, master cylinders, couplings in the lines?  Check the whole 
length of the lines, too, since you may have chucked a rock or something 
up on the logging roads and damaged something.  

I'd be freaking if my pedal would drop to the floor every now and then!

Any other info you could add to your description?  Any other ideas out there?
