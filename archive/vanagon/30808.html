 &gt; &gt;Does anyone know where I can get the 10mm 12 spline key wrench needed to

 &gt; Thet're not the easiest things to find.  I got mine from the Parts Place,
 &gt; Inc. in Michigan.

I had no trouble *finding* them; I had trouble finding *good* ones.  I wrecked 
3 K-D versions taking the drive shafts off my Jetta transaxle, then chased and 
tackled a Snap-On truck and bought one from him.  It was worth every penny of 
the $16 to get a *quality* tool that wouldn't break, or make me go back to the 
parts store *again*.  I figure it's better to by a GOOD tool than make another 
trip to the store (which is a minumum hour delay, since I have to crawl out 
from under the car, wash up, drive to the store, drive to the OTHER store that 
has the part in stock, buy it, go home, drink a Coke, and then go back to 
work...)

So what is this kerch dude babbling about? Bottom line, I recommend you get a 
Snap-On version of *this* tool.  You just won't have any trouble with it.
