&gt; Removed &quot;the vent at the rear of the door with the blue lever&quot;.
&gt; Used a flashlight with a small mech's mirror to brouse around.
&gt; Can find no air passages to these vents.
&gt; Yet air flows!
&gt; Is it leaking through the window seals and door handles?

That's the theory, I believe.  It just vents the air to the inside of the
door and lets it go out drain holes, etc...
