Subject: '85 Heater core update.

Seems that the part at my FLAPS for $125 is the best deal going, so I guess
I'll go pay in advance, and hope to heat the rear cabin soon.

As to the front unit (had noticed smell associated with it, defroster is less
hot that leg heat), I took off the cover and took a look at the inextricable
front blower unit.  Doesn't look like I can get in it, but it also doesn't
look like there is a pool of antifreeze in it (no strong smell with my nose
right up in it)  Am thinking (hoping) that the problem is more likely with
radiator or valve.

Don't really want to crawl up under the bus in this weather, so thinking of
taking it into FLARS.  

1. Wondering what specific instructions to give him, as to what to look at.

2.  Is there a diagnosis process for that front heater core, without removal?
 Drilling a small hole in the blower housing for instance?

3.  Is the valve accessable on top of spare tire, or do I pull that rubber
oval plug in the cabin floor?
