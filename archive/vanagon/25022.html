Subject: Kalypso--Disaster Magnet

Hello All,
My new job still prevents me from writing as often as I like, but here is
an update on Kalypso, my '87 Westy.

First, John asked me about symptoms of my impending transmission doom. the
first clue was when
Kalypso seemed to jerk out of 4rth gear on a highway downshift rather
violently. After that, the tranny didn't want to shift _out_ of 4rth gear.
That was a definite symptom that the synchronizer band on 4rth gear wuz
broke. The trans then lost reverse, first, and second. That was a symptom
of total transmission damage.

The new trans shifts a little weird, but is loosening up as the miles go
on. I'm changing the fluid (Redline, like the directions say) at 1000
miles, if I can find a drain plug (I don't see one yet--do I have to turn
the van sideways to drain the trans oil?).

In other horrific news, at 2:20 AM on Saturday night, as I lay safely
asleep, a kid running away from the police in a high speed car chase
smashed into a parked Kalypso and ripped out the driver's rear corner of
the bus. At least the police caught him. We're talking several new sections
for repair. At least he didn't hit the large side panel. I'll post pictures
if I can scan them in and anyone feels like donating the space on a www
page.

I'll keep you posted on costs and repairs. At least I can tell the
insurance company &quot;hey, just look at the police report and fix my van.&quot;

Peace,
Dave
