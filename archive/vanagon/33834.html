&gt;&gt; There's also a sense of not being a victim that owning a car you can work 

&gt;&gt; on engenders.  I owned an 82 diesel vanagon I felt a victim of.  My 66
&gt;
&gt;That kinda says it for me. It's independence: the ability to establish a
&gt;base of knowledge from which you can diagnose and repair problems on your
&gt;own vehicle...
    &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Newer buses? I don't know. '71 is as far as I've gotten.

On my 1980 V6anagon, I replaced the front steering rack &amp; pinion
assembly with simple hand tools and a small ball joint fork, 1600
miles from home. Unbolt the old one, bolt on the new one, like working
with tinkertoys. Try that in a Chrysler!
