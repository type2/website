The former.  There's the flat piston head, the wrist pin mounts, and a
little skirting just around the latter.  No skirting where there's no
wrist pin mounts, and no skirting past the mounts, either.  While
still mounted on the connecting rod, the piston could be turned about
thirty degrees to left or right.  This all appears to be due purely to
connecting rod wear, as the wrist pin looks perfect.
