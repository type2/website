Subject: What's THAT Sound? (71)

We're new to the list, so please forgive if this, or something similar,
has been discussed recently.  Not being the in-house mechanic myself,
and the guy with the title having no clue (and being out of town),
thought I might see if someone here could give some assistance.

We have a 1971 bus.  Last week it made a screeching noise in the rear (I
wasn't allowed to hear it, so can only relate what I was told).  We
routinely haul heavy musical equipment, and when loaded, the sound
disappeared, then didn't reappear when unloaded.  A couple days ago, a
new sound appeared.

The sound is sort-of a dull (but loud), rythmic vibrating noise--
somewhere in rear underneath, and resonates through the floor.  Seems to
really kick in about 50 mph, is worse on flat terrain, and under power. 
Just bought new tires, and everything seems okay there.  Could it be
something to do with the (bear with me on the terminology) struts? 
shocks?  whatever those doo-hickies are called?  You know--that
suspension stuff....(BANG!--clank--clank I can understand).

Would appreciate any suggestions....what it might be--easy, difficult to
fix, etc.  Unless this is something of general interest (as in happens
sooner or later), would appreciate responses in private e-mail.

Thanks in advance....Myrna
