Subject: 16&quot; Translation (4x4 article from Germany)

Wow.

As you can see below I finally got a translation of a German 4x4 magazine's
review of a diesel version of the Vanagon outfitted with the special 16&quot;
wheels and extra ground clearance. 

The reviewers weren't too happy about the diesel motor but the review is
interesting nonetheless. Apparently, the 16&quot; wheeled version of the vanagon,
(the idea of such a vehicle makes me drool and covet the suspension parts)
was delivered *only* with this diesel motor. As far as I can tell, this
motor is a no-go because you cannot cross rivers with it whereas I cross
rivers with my gas- powered 14&quot; vanagon all the time (to a depth half-way up
the bumper anyway).

Anyway, the here's the review. Where I couldn't resist I put comments
beginning with ******.

Derek
