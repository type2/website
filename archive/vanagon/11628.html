Subject: Re: more tidbits,(f) Fiat 850


I test drove a Fiat 600 &quot;sedan&quot; years ago. It was a used one for sale in
Victoria. Everything about it was toy like, esp. the engine and
teeny-tiney radiator. It was &quot;fun&quot; to drive, the brakes locked-up at the
least bit of provacation, (4 wheel drum), I actually got the rear end off
the ground a la &quot;too much front brake on a bike&quot;.
Strangely, it didn't have any noticable rust.
I would love to have one now, as long as I was the only car on the road.
