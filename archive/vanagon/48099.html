Jim, you can pressure test the tank and line to see if this is the
problem.Remove the tank and plug all connections and pressure test it.A
competant radiator shop should be able to handle it for you.In light of the
fact that a new tank costs over $400.00 I would recommend it. My tank
recently got crushed in by a bozo tire installer....(&quot;I thought that was the
frame I was jacking up....DUHHHHH&quot;) I removed my tank and my rad man
pressurized it to 15lbs and it popped the dents out...and gave me 2 more
gals. capacity to boot.....listen up vanagoners....more reserve. Anyway it
was a cheap fix...$15.00 vs. $440.00.
