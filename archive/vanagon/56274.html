Subject: Re: very interesting siting

There is a German military operation on the grounds of Dulles
Airport, in Virginia near Washington DC. German pilots do extensive
flight training in various parts of the United States, and I understand
that this operation manages all the German activities here. 

I've seen the Vanagons parked inside their compound, and have 
wondered why they aren't T4 units...
