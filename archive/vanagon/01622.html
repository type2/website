Subject: Re: sychroning carbs

&gt;&gt;My question lies therein.  Is there any way that I can sychronize the carbs
&gt;&gt;myself?  I've read the Bentley and it's very explicit about how you should
&gt;&gt;&quot;take it to an authorized VW mechanic&quot; to have this done.  It then gives this
&gt;&gt;lenthy definition of how to adjust the carbs.
&gt;
&gt;tim, you can do anything that the mechanics can do IF you have some equipment
&gt;and experience. mostly experience. :)  for equipment, think about what other
&gt;vehicles have multiple carbs ... like motorcycles! so check at the Honda
&gt;or Yamaha shops and see how they do it. :)  one fellow i know with honda
&gt;with three carbs built his own 'little' syncronizer: since what he wanted to
&gt;do was adjust the carbs so that they sucked equally, he got a plywood board
&gt;and  mounted three tubes/loops of water on it. he fixed up a deal so that it
&gt;would hold one end of the tubes in each carb. then he adjusted the carbs
&gt;until the levels of the water was the same in each tube. he 'improved' it
&gt;as he went along: adding a white background with black marks (so he could
&gt;better tell how much a tube was off from the next), and coloring the water
&gt;(or did he change to oil?). anyway, it's an old system that they used to
&gt;call a Manometer, i think. something like that anyway.  they also used to
&gt;use those tubes of fluid to measure air pressure on very old wind tunnels.


I would imagine (ie; I have not tried this) that with two carbs you would
only need one U-shaped tube.  With one end stuck in each carb you would be
able to see the difference between the carbs, instead of the pressure
difference between each carb and the ambient pressure.
