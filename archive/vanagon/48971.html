They make a tension guage which measures  the pressure on belt, but I have a
lot of experience with belts after 20 years of servicing cars.I generally
tension the belt until, when grasped in the center between pulleys, you can
just barely twist it 90 degrees with a lot of force.Another indication is to
tension until , when you grasp the belt, and pull laterally, you can turn the
engine over.If the belt slips but the engine/pulley doesnt turn, the belt is
a tad loose. My pumps have lasted greater than 100k mi with this method,
unscientific....more...seat of the pants..For what it is worth.
