Subject:      who's the David??

ok ... who is the David that came through Tuscaloosa from Ozark, AL and
left all the messages on my answering machine??? :)

i don't recall anybody who said they were off on a long trip saying anything
about coming through here ... only one guy was headed even in this general
direction and he said he was going through Memphis (which is a long way
from Ozark)???

anyway, sorry i missed you, but i didn't get back until about 5:00pm. :(
and you are right ... the junkyard guy thinks he's the only source around
... which he is. :(
