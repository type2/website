So Jeff Rosen says:
&gt; 	Passed through Four Corners Monument around 2:00pm.  Yep- passed 
&gt; right through.  $5.00 admission to stand in four states at once?  I'd 
&gt; rather visit Graceland.

This sounds so funny to me.  I'm picturing this long line of people paying
five dollars to stand in a little tent about the size of a portable latrine.
I'm sure it's a well marked spot!! :) ;) :)
