Subject: Looking for machinist in NC

Greetings,

Last week I bought a '76 camper with a siezed-up engine.  I've gotten 
the engine out and have begun dismantling so now it's time to find a 
good machinist nearby.  Has anyone on this list ever been to T. Hoff 
in Raleigh?  They seem to be the only place around with a decent 
parts selection, and they said on the phone that they do many 
aircooled engines.

Does anyone have advice one how to choose a machinist?  What 
questions to ask, what to look for, etc...

I bought this bus from a friend.   It evidently siezed up a couple 
months ago.  I've never worked on a fuel injection system before (my 
last bus was a '73) but the PO said he never had any problem with it, 
so I'm hoping I can just hook all those wires and hoses back up and 
go!  Getting the engine out was fairly straightforward, except the 
muffler wouldn't come off the heater boxes.  I'll probably get the 
heads off and split the case in the next couple of days.
