Subject: JCW Clearance-wiring and FI's for breadloaves/vgons

Hey now,
        Got some parts from JCW today, amongst the usual ad garbage came a
clearance catalog with the following that may be of intrest:

CATALOG # CS-75                       STOCK #         PRICE/$

WIRING HARNESS KIT                    88ZJ9624T       10.00
FUEL INJECTOR (74-79 T2)              73ZJ5395A       34.95
FUEL INJECTOR (80-83 2000CC VGON)     73ZJ7573A       34.95
HIGH PERF. LIGHTENED FLYWHEELS (67-70)86ZJ0385N       72.95   (4 DOWEL)
HIGH PERF. LIGHTENED FLYWHEELS (67-70)86ZJ0386T       76.95   (8 DOWEL)

        The wiring harness was also available for 53-55 beetle 1200's
(email for #s) and the ad says these wiring kits are bumper to bumper
except bat cables and plug wires. Don't know if the FI prices are a good
deal or not, never delt with FI. There were also several after market
header systems, I didn't include these as I think most of us agree headers
are kewl sano junk. Email me privately if you *really* want the header #s.
I do not own JCW, no affiliation, etc...

Peace,
