FROM: H YATES


Just to touch back on the tire questions/advice that has been kicking
around this month.  I have a '90 syncro westfalia, and I did a lot
of research before retreading.  The Syncro Camper is much heavier than
the regular vans, and the Michelin XCH4 wasn't of the correct load
rating for the Syncro.  I chose the Yokohama Y370 LT195 75/14 tire.
They are a D load rating, (over 1700 lbs capacity), and I run 43 psi
front, 53 psi rear.  They are quiet, smooth, tough, have an all-terrain
type tread, and run very cool in the summer.  The wear is excellent
as well as the roadhandling.  I always push my van 30 km/hr over the
recommended speeds around corners without complaint.  The tires just
grip and perform wonderfully.  No tire squeal, either.  They are
also excellent in the rain and snow.  I was so impressed with Yokohama
tires, I bought some 382's for our Golf.

A full set of four cost me around $450 Canadian installed, balanced, etc.
but worth every cent.  With these vans, you can't put on garbage tires.
Because of the 14 inch wheel, it is important to get the correct load
rating for your own safety as well as performance.  I am currently on
my second set of Yokohamas, and would highly recommend them.

Thx.
