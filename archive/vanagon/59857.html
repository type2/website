Subject: Re: Alternate A/C refrigerants?

my 89 westie has the same stains around the compressor clutch. I took it
to the toyota place (I was there on other buisness) and had their mech
look at it. I have only had my van a couple of weeks and it never did
cool down a lot. The mech did not turn on the van and put one of those
recover units on it and told me he could not get anything out of it.
(refr wise) He also said he had never tried a vw before. Anyway I did
not get freon put in it, He told me the clutch probably would not even
engage due to low pressure,, but after I left I tried the clutch and it
did engage I wonder if my a/c is ok?
