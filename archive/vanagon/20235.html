OK, you maniacs!

I got flooded by people asking me where I got the &quot;Journeys under 
difficult conditions&quot; manual.  These folks were apparently just itching to 
get their kidneys rattled and their busses filled with dust.

My source for the manual should come as no surprise to those of you who 
have been on the list very long.  Joel Walker did it.  Yep, he gave me a 
copy of the manual when we visited him in 'bama earlier this year.  Now, 
Joel's a nice fellow with lots of work to do so I don't want to dump this 
whole manual copying thing on him.  Then again, I'm not working right 
now, and seeing as I am an oppressed member of the proletariat being 
exploited by the bourgeoisie pigs as a source of surplus labour (read: I'm 
unemployed), and that photocopying/mailing costs money, here's what I'll 
propose to anyone who wants a copy of the manual:

- Send me your name and s-mail address
- The manual is 58 pages long.  I figure It'll cost me about $0.07/page
  to copy, so $4.00 Canadian to copy, and maybe another $4.00 to mail to 
  the states (anthough I'm kinda guessing on this mailing cost).  I think 
  it'd be $2.85 to mail in Canada.  The US/Canadian exchange rate is 
  hovering around $0.72 to the American dollar these days (boo hoo).  I 
  haven't a clue about the cost of mailing overseas.
- Send me some bux to cover the cost of mailing, and I'll still be able 
  to eat and drink the occaissional bottle of drinkable wine.  And no, I 
  won't wait until your check clears before sending you the stuff.  
  I'll trust you.  If you're in my situation or a student or anything like 
  that, send me a wierd postcard from where you live, or some bizarre 
  object you might have found under the rear seat one day.  I could 
  always use a little Something For Bob, but it's probably not a good 
  idea to mail that sort of thing.  If you choose not to send 
  anything, that's ok: it's your karma, after all. 
- If I mail you this manual and then you go wild off road and break your 
  bus, I'm not responsible, got it?  (Not that I'm very responsible 
  anyway...)
- Anyone who asks for this manual will be mercilessly hounded to join in 
  on the next Big Trip Christa and I are planning for next summer.  Martha 
  may be joining us.  I'll break the idea to the list as soon as I have 
  more info (in a week or two).  Suffice to say it'll involve 4,000 to 
  5,000 km of dirt road, maybe more.

So there you have it.  Sorry to be so cheap, but it's an economic 
necessity at this point...
