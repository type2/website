&gt; On a side note.  What has anyone found that works (without breaking) to take
&gt; off the rear axle nuts???  Last time we had them off we got a BIG socket and
&gt; a BIG breaker bar and put the end of the bar on the ground and used engine
&gt; torque to break the suckers loose.  It was hard even then (the back of the
&gt; bus would start to raise).  I have to adjust/clean up the rear
&gt; brakes/parking mech.

I have taken off the axle nuts using a big 3/4 inch drive socket and breaker
bar.  I also put on a pipe for extra length and and place a block of wood
under the socket.  All I have to do is just step on it and it comes off
easily.   It works fine tightening too.  I have done this many times on my
Rabbit axles so I can almost do it with my eyes closed.
