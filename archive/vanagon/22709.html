Also, although it'll cost more than $6, check the want ads for used fiche 
readers for sale.  I've seen them for maybe $50, which might be a good 
investment if you come across a huge set of parts fiche.  Also, go to 
auctions of surplus equipment put on by state governments and 
universities.  Fiche is being supplanted by electronic formats like 
CD-ROM on online library catalogs.
