&gt;Today in the mail I received a yellow postcard indicating a
&gt;sale at Rocky Mountain Motorworks in Colorado.  They are offering
&gt;15% off VW parts for March 6-10.  As I don't have any need to order
&gt;parts right at the moment, if anyone would like my card, I'll be
&gt;happy to snail-mail it...

That's interesting, Martha. I got the same card last week and their offer
was valid from 2/27 to 3/3. Marketing at its best, apparently.
