I do have the Eurovan, Weekender with the folding bed, etc.

The generator will fit in the space under the bed (but not under the 
bench).

I've looked at several alternative configurations but I'm considering some 
variable constraints.

As I alluded, there are quite a few of us in the family so the EV functions 
frequently as a people carrier (even when we're not going camping). There 
are times we need the space to take baggage and 'stuff'. Being able to move 
items in the rear and under the bench is important.

I'm keenly aware that young-people may change interests with little 
advanced notice. Camping may not be the 'popular' thing soon or next year.

While the wife and I do go off by ourselves, we may not take as much 
'stuff' as when we go with the family (the generator normally does not go 
with the two of us). I don't want to modify the EV for permanent 
suitability to use the generator from inside the EV.

I've also looked at some other choices such as battery packs, etc. but 
decided (with coaching from The Matriarch) that I don't want to turn the EV 
into a giant &quot;power source&quot; on wheels. I even have considered a trailer but 
the thought of functioning as a mobile, mini- boulder dam seems to get away 
from the prime purposes for the EV (pleasure, comfort and the ability to 
'get-away' on short notice. ...Hey, kids are nice and enjoyable but, now, 
they come with one critical option, their parents :)  ).

The trailer idea has not been completely ruled out but this past summer we 
were (I was) 'convinced' to tow a boat then some Jet-Skis. I'm letting 'the 
riders' know that there are some limits to the toys we take. :)
