&gt;What would an 87 camper (Sink, Stove, Refrig)  in good condition go for?
I looked at one a few weeks back with 118K miles. It was in good condition 
with a few strange mods (boat-style cleats on the bumpers?), but otherwise 
pretty straight. It was originally from the NW, but had spent the last two 
winters in Pittsburg and the owner had a friend drive it back to Seattle to 
sell it (much better market here). He was asking 10,400 and would settle for 
10000.
