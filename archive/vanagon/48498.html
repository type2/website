Subject: Re: ABS on your 1991 Vanagon??

My '89 has anti-lock brakes, but not the fancy computer controlled kind.
They are just so wimpy that they won't lock!  I call them &quot;plan ahead&quot;
brakes.

&gt;Percent of consumers who &quot;believe&quot; they have ABS on their 1991

&gt;Volkswagen Vanagon 92%
&gt;Jeep Wrangler               89%
&gt;Toyota Land Cruiser   82%
