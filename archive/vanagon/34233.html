Subject: Pop-top replacements

If you've got an old bus not worth spending much money on (like me), try
this.  The trunk seals from Jetta's are almost identical to the pop-top 
seal, I bought 3 from a wrecking yard ($15-20 CDN total I think).  I 
doubt you'ld ever win any awards with them on, but from three feet away, 
they look exactly the same, and keep the wind out of your bus!
Cheers!
