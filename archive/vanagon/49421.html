Did a little research and found this... maybe it will scare away people from
multispaming the site...




To Whom It May Concern,

You are hereby advised that any future mail from 
you will result in my taking legal action in Small Claims Court as 
provided for in Federal law:

Under USC 47 Sec.227(b)(1)(C):

        &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States
to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device
to send an unsolicited advertisement to equipment which has the capacity 
to transcribe text or images (or both) from an electronic signal 
received over a regular telephone line.&quot;

Under Sec.227(b)(3)(B):

        &quot;A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws
or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of
that State -
          (A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or
the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin
such violation,
          (B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such
a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such
violation, whichever is greater, or
          (C) both such actions. If the court finds that the
defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the
regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court
may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award
to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount
available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.&quot;
