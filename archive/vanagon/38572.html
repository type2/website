Subject: giving away westy sink console...

Dear list,
  Seeing how we all love our busses, I'm giving away a westy sink console
from my 73 bus. Free to a good home.
Least I can do for all your help on my project...It has the sink, hand-
powered water pump, a drawer and some sort of fold-out-table. Color is
yellow. I have no more use for it since I put in some home-made furniture
recently. I also have a beige seat cushion from god knows where (seat behind
driver ??). If you wanna pick it up: I'm on the southern Oregon coast. Don't
know how I would ship it though, it's pretty bulky...Any takers ??
  Ciao,
        Gregor
