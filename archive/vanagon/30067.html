Subject: '74 Camper-please help!

Hello all,

This summer I decided to tackle a '74 Camper that had been garage bound
for about ten years since it died and my dad gave up on it.
Unfortunately, no one seems to remember exactly what its fatal ailment
was. The best I could make of the sketwchy stories was that it began to
lose alot of compression. My pop took it to someone who told him it
would need a new engine.  Apparently it was driven up the driveway into
its temporary tomb till I began my ideas of reincarnation this summer.

We dragged this thing out and to our suprise found it to be in pretty
good shape as far as rust and body were concerned. We hooked a battery
up to it and got nothing but a few lights on the dashboard.

I should mention that while we were pulling the thing out the main belt
did turn a bit, so I guess the engine hasn't completely seized up--a
good sign I suppose.

To get to the point, we took the engine out, admired its beauty for a
while, and then became confused--now what??  How can we find out what,
if anything is wrong with this engine?

Is there anything I should look for, or a way to test it? I'm assuming
that after ten years it might be the starter that's my first problem.
Should I order a new starter and take it from there??

Should I attemp to rebuild it? Is it possible that it wouldn't be
necessary to rebuild the entire thing--might it only be in need of a few
parts--is it actually realistic that the solution to my troubles might
be something simple?? Or should I just trade the thing in for a rebuilt
one??

I've already got Muir's Bible and a Chilton's manual which could learn a
little something from John Muir--cartoons can't hurt.

Right now, time is easier to spare than money.

whew...that's alot of questions, but I don't know where else to turn.
Mechanics turn pale with the mere mention of a &quot;'74 VW Bus&quot;--they speak
of it as if it were some dark, evil thing.

Thanks for any help.

Ben
