The idea is to connnect the batteries together only when they are 
charging. The relay is an electric switch which connects them togther 
when it &quot;sees&quot; 12 volts from the ignition relay.

Most experts say connecting lead acid batteries in parallel (except during 
charging) will drain both batteries, as one always is more charged than 
the other.
