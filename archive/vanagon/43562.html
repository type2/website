&gt;Any advice as to the problem? The thermostat is removed, and there's a 2
&gt;inch gap in the engine seal near the rear that I plan on fixing, could that
&gt;contribute to the problem?  Thanks for any and all advice,  Tom

1.  Thermostat??? In an air cooled engine?  Maybe its just late and I'm not
thinking clearly.

2.  Yes, the gap in the engine compartment could have a big effect on the air
cooling capability of the van.
