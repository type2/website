&gt; I have a set of PDSIT's I pulled off of a '69 type III.   They are in good
&gt; shape with chokes and ran fine when removed and stored over five years ago.
&gt; I'd box them up and sell them for um..... $75, I'd cover the shipping.  They
&gt; have type III manifolds, linkage and air cleaner assembly (wide, flat,
&gt; roundy thing that goes across the top of the engine), with two new spare
&gt; filters (over $20 each).

I know that you were responding to another fellow, but if he passes on 
the carbs, I'd like to bargain with you!
