Subject: 91 Westfalia stalling woes

This will be of no comfort to you, but your situation reminds me of my
father's first and only venture with &quot;superior&quot; german automobile technology
25 years ago.

He was talked into giving up his Buicks for a beautiful 71 280 SE which cost
the outrageous sum of $8200. Handled like a sports car and would cruise _at_115
without a whimper (a trait known to his son if not him personally).However,
it also had a habit of refusing to restart after a brief run until it had a
15 minute nap. That progressed to stopping dead in the middle of the road in
the midst of an otherwise flawless drive. Aggravating, especially given the
arrogant nature of MB dealership (salesmen may have been &quot;consultants&quot; at
that time). After one of the many fruitless repair sessions, the car was
fitted with a mystery button on the dash----- in the event of trouble, push
this.  It should have been connected to a AAA call box for it had no effect
at all on the car's ability to stay mobile.

After 18 months  he told the dealer that some day they were going to screw up
and sell a car to some one who wasn't big enough to push it where he wanted
to go and he sold it for $6500. In a patriotic fit he went and bought a new
Granada.

I hope you have a happier ending.

Weston
