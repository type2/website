&gt; Gas mileage continued to suck, though, even after I finally installed
&gt; an electric choke and adjusted the idle jets to run a lot leaner than
&gt; they had been. Thought that maybe the carb's main jets had been changed

Welcome to the Citation V6!  I never got better than 13mpg on mine.  
NEVER.  What a piece of trash.  It was a pleasure to get that bus and 
start doing 20-22mpg!

I hope you do better than did I!
