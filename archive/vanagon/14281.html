&gt; No , no. Go with a Digifant system with the O2 sensor, knock sensor. Keep
&gt; the stock intake manifold but use a Dasher exhaust manifold and instead of the

I bow to your experience and idea, at the time we did ours I had not
seen Digifant (Motronic?) equipped cars like my Corrado or our ex '89
Jetta but certainly you are correct.  The glory in doing it this way of
course is not having to F_at_#$ with the fuel lines from the fuel
distributor to the injectors, on the digifant you would simply connect
the fuel main rail to the pump, route the output from the pressure
regulator back to the tank and whala! you are done, to boot you can hang
a K&amp;N performance conical filter ($50 or so) anywhere there is room.
My question is now about the Dasher exhaust manifold. Why? why not the
stocker, the dashers never had O2 sensors did they, I thougt they were
K-Jetronic with no feedback only. If not what's the gain.  The Digifant
idea also removes the warm up regulator routing for the K KE system,
another great plus. My only further concern is cost, a mechanicla lifter
GTI with all the fixins would run you at least $500 less around here,
junkyards typically know the value of the knock sensor ignition
components, etc.  Makes me want to run out right now and buy a diesel
Vanagon if I could find one.  Of course it should be noted the Digifant
cars are rarer in general as well, from '89 up only I believe, I tell
you though them cross flow 2.0 liters, somebody should look into that,
the intake manifold would then come in on the passenger side where room
is plentiful although clearance with the engine cover could be
questionable, but when I last looked at a Jetta III seemed it wrapped up
pretty tight over the valve cover, of course also working against you is
the fact that new block is a little taller.  For that matter, how much
is the new 1.9 liter diesel rated for.  Seems you could have the best of
both worlds if it was good for 75 hp or so, reasonable acceleration
approaching a Wasserboxer while keeping the mileage.

Anyway just some ramblings,
