Jim,
If you have not had acts before, a word of caution::  different cats
react differently to car &amp; road noise, especially on long trips.  the
fact that they are so young should help.  Nevertheless, some cats are
actually terrified of the noises they hear in a vehicle, and some just
love traveling.  We have four cats, three of them hate the vans, one
of them loves to stretch out on the dash, or sit on my left shoulder and
stick his nose out the window when I drive.  

In order to help the kitties adjust, you might want to drive them around
a little for a couple of days, especially at highway speeds before you
take the plunge.

Good luck.
Cetin
