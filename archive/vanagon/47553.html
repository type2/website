This was emailed to me.  I thought it might be useful for the group. 
Just replace &quot;van or bus&quot; for every occurance of car.

&gt; &gt; &gt;

Buying a used car out of the Classifieds is pretty tricky, so I thought
I'd translate some of the &quot;used car lingo&quot; for you all.

MUST SELL
...before it blows up.

RUNS FINE
...I was going to say &quot;runs excellent&quot; but I had a last-minute concience
attack.

NEEDS SOME BODY WORK
...was blindsided by a Winnebego.

WELL-MAINTAINED
...I changed the oil occasionally.

LOOKS LIKE NEW
...just don't try to drive it anywhere.

ALL ORIGINAL
...I never had anything fixed, adjusted, or replaced.

LOADED WITH OPTIONS
...each one more troublesome than the next.

NEVER SMOKED IN
...unfortunately, that's the best thing I can say about it.

PROJECT CAR
...doesn't run.

LOTS OF POTENTIAL
...doesn't run.

NEEDS MINOR REPAIR
...doesn't run.
