Subject: Yokohama Y370 vs. Y356

       
       YOKOHAMA Y370 vs Y356
       
       The confusion reigns! Yokohama has called back and now says 
       the following is the official, true story:
       
       The Y370 series (passenger and light truck) was discontinued 
       a few years ago, except for the Y370 LT 195/75R14, which was 
       kept in production because it was an OEM tire (for which 
       vehicle, she couldn't remember) and because Vanagon owners 
       kept calling Yokohama asking for it.
       
       The Y370 is being phased out and the official replacement, 
       according to Yokohama, is the Y356 LT 195/75R14.
       
       The major differences are:
       - tread pattern
       - the Y370 is a non-reinforced sidewall 8-ply
       - the Y356 is a reinforced sidewall, comes in 6- or 8-ply
       
       Anyone out there using a Y356? Please respond with your 
       comments and I will add those to the Y370 and Michelin rants 
       and raves.
       
       Thanks again, 
       
       Jahan
