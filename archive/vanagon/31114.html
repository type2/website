Subject: Rustoleum propellent pressure

        All,
        I've been using Rustoleum spraypaint for touch-up on this
project- satin black for the engine tin and antique white for the body
work. Two days ago, when doing the rear apron, I had a heck of a time
getting the rusty-metal-primer to spray. It kept clogging, in spite
of my flushing out the spray nozzle with laquer thinner and shaking
vigoriously. So I tried letting the top-coat can soak in a bowl of
hot tap water for about 10 minutes. WOW. No clogging! Lots of
pressure,  and very good dispersion.

        Seems like the propellent may have a higher flash point
than it used to, or maybe it disolves in the paint and doesn't come
out at low temps... instructions say 50 F or warmer, which it was...
Anyone else have this experience, or similar?

        I've started wearing throw-away vinyl gloves and my respirator
when spray-painting and I have to admit its a lot more comfortable.
Recomended by a former tough guy who used to just paint stuff as he was.
