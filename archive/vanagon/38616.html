Subject: Syncro Vibration Solved

Hi everyone-

A couple of weeks ago i mentioned that i had some severe vibration that could
be both heard and felt within my 87' while both idling and moving.  The
problem ended up being the rear transmission mounts, which i had VW
replace.... too cold here to do outside now. (not cheap either)  Anyway, all
is well for now.

Mike
