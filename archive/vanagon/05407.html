Subject: RE: Question re: engine removal

My impression is that the Type 4 engines, including Peter Williams' 73, hold
up the transaxles, rather than vice versa.  So Peter you do need to support
the trans while the engine is out, either with a jack stand underneath, or
with a 2x4 hung from chains if you want the van to be able to roll while the
engine is on the operating table.
