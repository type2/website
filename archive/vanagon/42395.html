Hi All,

No longer a sniveling lurker/wannabus am I. Last night, I purchased my '76
Double Cab. It's not the most attractive car in the world (or so says my
wife), but I think it's a great looking car. I guess all children look
beautiful to their parents.

The background on the beast as per the previous owner:

It was originally owned by the German Army and was brought over here by a
US serviceman stationed in Deutschland. It's currently primer gray on the
outside, but the inside color is a *lovely* olive drab. The speedometer is
in KPH only, and there's lots of German stickers throughout the interior.
One for tire pressure, another for what the PO told me was it's military
identification plate (dog tags?).

In addition, it's got a cover for the bed which is in fair shape. Rust is
mostly surface, with one major spot in the front passenger side lower
frame. Guess I gotta learn how to weld?

For now though, I just walk around outside and look at it occasionally. I
get a big old goofy grin, and then I walk back in. My wife says I look like
a big old idiot. I tell ya, I couldn't agree with her more, and I couldn't
be happier.

Oh, one more thing. First thing I did this morning was to put my list
sticker on the window. It's official!

Best to all, and a big thanks to Kyle Wade in helping me to locate it!

Cheers,

Bren
