LO!!!

Well, I am new to this list as of Thursday, and I just HAD to ask a question
that has been eating t my mind for about a year no about my '72 panle van tht
I am restoring.  Does anybody know how many of these beasts were made?  I
have been told that they are rare, but I really don't want to believe it
until I have proof for myself!  ;-)  (I don't want to get my hopes up)

Also, besides owning the '72 panel van, I have a '73 automatic Bus (his name
in Dank) with a camper interior (not orriginal, somebody put the camper
equipment in there) that  I just put a rebuild '81, 2.0 litre vanagon motor
in it.  This van is very solid, but could use a paint job.  I will probably
get Dank painted around September or so.
 And my last van is a '71 deluxe Bus with a sunroof.  That bad boy is just
kind or sitting there until I can get around to the restoration.  It needs a
LOT of work!  Basically, it needs EVERYTHING!!!!!!  It mainly needs the front
nose panel replaced because of rust and BULLET HOLES!!!!!!!  Don't ask how
they got there.  THat has something to do with the last owner!
My daily driver is a completely restored '84 Wolfsburg edition Scirocco.
 GREAT car!  I LOVE it!  Name is Wolfgang.

Well, gotta run!  Thanks if anybody know the #s for the panel van!

Tim :)
