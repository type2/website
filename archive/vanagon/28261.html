Subject: Shop Horror Stories - Web Page
Date: Tue, 7 Nov 1995 09:47:33 -0800 (PST)

It seems everyone has a shop horror story...

So, what I wanna do, the agitator I am, is put together a web page with
a collection of these diabolical diatribes.

I've already started with mine, if you want yours included, just mail it
to me (tfab_at_netcom_dot_com).  I'll even do the html-ization.  Just write it 
up and make a good pass at grammer and spelling.  Be sure to include
where the shop is, along with how much you got screwed for, and the
resolution, if any. 

The page is:

ftp://ftp_dot_netcom_dot_com/pub/tf/tfab/auto.html

If I can help just one person from getting screwed, I'll have a glowing warm
fuzzy.

And of course, the lawyer types who wanna start with the libel crap and
the copyright crap: you are cordially invited to &quot;stick it.&quot;
