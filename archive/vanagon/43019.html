Subject: Re: Propane Vs. Electric refrigerators?


&gt;We just have a westy icebox.  Don't know if it's better than a fridge, but
&gt;certainly cheaper.  I don't expect that finding ice to keep things cool
&gt;will be a problem.  The only drawback to the icebox is that the ice itself
&gt;takes up space you could otherwise use for food (or beer--same thing).

        My 72 camper came with an electric fridge,  it would kill the house
battery in about 1 1/2 hours (voltage limited  _at_ 10.1 VDC), not good.  I
replaced it with  a diode cooler.  I think that Igloo has several models.
By diode cooler I mean those coolers that are intended to plug into the
cigerette lighter, I belive that they are sold under the
description,&quot;electric ice chest&quot;, or something similar.  These us a small
fraction of the current of a fridge.  But, they do not freze.  They keep
food cool, not cold.  I have mine wired derictly to a power bus in the
camper (yes, I installed an in line fuse)an placed in the same space that
the fridge was in.  It's a little smaller than the fridge was on the sides
(just the right size space for a folding chair).
        On a trip last June I bought eggs, milk, and butter in Sacramento
Ca. and they were still food four days later in Ogden Ut.  So I guess it
worked but I will say that the cooler never felt 'cold'.  Based in this
sucess I have also installed one in my '82 Vanagon.
