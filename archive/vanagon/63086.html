Subject:      Are all rebuilt engines the same?

I know this sounds dumb, but are the rebuilt engines sold by VW better than
those sold by others?  I'm about to purchase one and would appreciate any
advice from someone wiser than I am.

What additional things need replacing when replacing the engine.  I would
think that the water pump and plugs need to be replaced as well as the fan
belt any hoses that look worn.  Is there anything else that should be
replaced?

Add my thanks to the dedicated people who keep this list up and running!
