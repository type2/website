Subject:  73 Westy parting out

I have a friend that is parting out a 73 Westy.  No motor, but he has
transmission, interior, dash etc, seats, icebox, headlamp assemblies
etc.  The body was in pretty good shape, it is just an extra one that
was acquired while searching for the best one.  If you want further
info, e-mail me and I will open dialogue with individuals.  I and the
Westy are located in North Carolina.
