Subject: Rust Question

Hey All:

I was under my Vanagon today and noticed that the pipes leading up to the 
radiator have lost their rust-coating and are starting to rust. Soooo, I 
searched the archives for some info on rustproofers and found Waxoyl.  My 
question is:

Is this stuff good for surfaces that are already rusting.  If possible, I 
want to use something that will act with the rust to form a seal, so I don't 
have to try and peel, sand the current rust down (in some parts the pipes 
are pretty rusted.) A while ago I used some spray on my GTI that somehow 
reacted to the rust and formed a seal, but I cannot remeber what it was or 
if it worked. ( Is old the car a month after I fixed all the rust with the 
stuff) I seem to remember that it was a spray in a black can.)

Thanks!

Matt
