This is not what I mean. There is a rod directly coming out of the
transmission box. Set the tranny to neutral and pull this rod it out
of the box. Now the tranny is in neutral between 3rd and 4th. Be sure,
that this small rod and the shift leveler don't move while tighten
the clamp. Maybe you will need some person to give you a hand to
secure the shift leveler.

&gt;------The manual says to center the stop fingers (the u shaped things at
&gt;the end of the shifter) between the 3rd and 4th position in the shifter
&gt;box, this should give the correct lenght of the rod. Been there done
&gt;that. I just do not see how the shifter plate on the inside of the cab
&gt;can also be adjusted.

&gt;&gt; Tighten the clamp.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What I see on your failure report, you should
&gt;&gt; only turn the rods against each other.
&gt; -you mean shorten the rod?
No, twist it. Your shifter rod has the wrong angle to fit the
pattern. The lenth of the rod seems to be OK.
