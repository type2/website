So they're here and ther're on and at 42 and 48 psi they're a whale of a lot
better than the UniRoyal Laredos.  Much better handling and that margin for
a bit more load (1700lbs/tire) makes Ruby (89 Syncro Westie) a bit more 
comfortable with 4 up with skis and associated paraphrenalia for a weekend in
the mountains.  Thanks to all the vanagoneers and especially Tom and Harry
for the help.  Found the Yoko 370Bs yes B through the yoko 800 number and
my FLATP Tire America.  Price was $75 each plus tax etc.

Fine shoes, better than OJs.

AND a 50K Factory warranty too.

BTW Ruby tops out at 5800 lbs with 3100 in the back.
