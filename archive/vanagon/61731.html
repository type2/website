Subject: Help Wanted- VW Repair, will train
Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 11:19:05 -0400

Jon Lukens, who handles VW Repair at The Bus Depot, asked me if I would
post this for him, since he's not on the List.  He pulled a muscle in his
back, and will be working more slowly than usual for the next couple of
weeks while it heals -  which will put him behind schedule, at a time when
he's already very busy.   H'e like to find a person or people who could
help him out, particularly for the next few weeks, so he can let his back
heal.  

Most of the work involves major engine repair and installation, fuel
injection repair, and other major work on Air-Cooled Busses &amp; Vanagons. 
Jon will be there to fully instruct, train, and oversee (assuming the
person needs it), so aptitude and a love for Volkswagens are more important
than experience.  Jon thought that for an enthusiast who'd like to learn
more about Bus repair, this could be mutually beneficial.  Although Jon
would happily accept even a few evenings worth of temporary help from an
interested enthusiast, apparantly he has enough work to keep someone busy
for just about as long as they'd want.   

For more info, hours, pay (or even barter for parts/repairs, as someone
suggested), etc., contact Jon directly.  (Although he &quot;sublets&quot; The Bus
Depot garage, he is actually independent of my parts business.)  His number
is 215-234-0890 (shop) or 234-8687 (home).
