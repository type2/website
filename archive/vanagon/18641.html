Subject: Hi Everybody!

	Hey You'uns!
I'm new to this list, and I thought that I'd introduce myself, just in
case there's anyone here from my area...
My wife Moe and I drive a '72 &quot;California Conversion&quot;, which is yellow and
rust currently, but will be a new coat of canary yellow next month. 
We are here, in Columbus, Ohio. We will be receiving our new vanity plates
soon : look out for us ---&gt; &quot;4STAG&quot;. We are members of the Central Ohio
Vintage Volkswagen Club as well, though we've yet to attend a meeting. We
will be at the upcoming meeting this Thursday, June 8, so look out for us!
If anyone here is also from Central Ohio, drop us a line!

					Michael &quot;Mick&quot; Forstag
