Hey all,
	I now call on the expertise of those who have breadloaf buses
	with air conditioning.  On my '78, the compressor is not
	currently hooked up, i.e. no belt.  However, by looking at the
	thing I can't tell for sh*t how to hook the darn thing up.
	There is nothing in the owner's manual about it.  I can see the
	pully on the compressor but I can't see how to get it over to
	the crankshaft pulley.  Can someone please tell me how to hook
	it up?  This one's got me stumped.  Thanks.  Also, where can I
	get a proper belt for this?  Is it the same one for the
	alternator or is it different?

	Things I did today:
	fixed fresh air flaps (PO duct-taped them closed for winter).
	aimed driver's side headlight
	visited FLAPS for parts


	Things to do tomorrow:
	tune-up, spark plugs, rotor, dist. cap, spark plug wires.
	get some spare hardware to tighten a couple things up.
	clean up accelerator return spring, thing sticks at high idle
	because spring is not returning pedal all the way -- maybe
	grease cable but that will have to wait.  

	try and figure out what's wrong with speedomoeter
	adjust rear brakes.

	That's not too much ;) .  Anyway, driving home, the bus
	performed very well, I was impressed.  Plenty of pep on the
	highway, actually left the right lane every now and then :) .  I
	really REALLY dig this bus!!!!!!!!

	Take it easy,
	Sean
