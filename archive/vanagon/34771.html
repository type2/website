Subject: EV with Big Pipe

Dan, 

It would be great if you could get a &quot;listen&quot; to this EV. While the big exhaust
pipe could be related to the installation of the VR6, I'm hoping that it is an
indicator of the new turbo-direct injection diesel. These new diesels are truly
excellent performers, making as much power and torque as the the 5 cyl. gas
engine, with lower fuel consumption!


Dave
