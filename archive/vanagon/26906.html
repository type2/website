Subject: Re:  65 bus won't start

&gt;
&gt;This morning I went to start my bus and it turned over like every
&gt;other morning. But after a few seconds it just died. Tried again to
&gt;start it and everything is churning but it won't start. So, I let it
&gt;sit for 5 minutes(thinking maybe it is flooded) and try to start it
&gt;again. Starts right up but again in a few seconds it dies. Applying
&gt;the accelerator pedal to keep it idling didn't work.
&gt;
&gt;I let it sit again for a few minutes and try once more but get the
&gt;same results.  I was late for work so I didn't get a chance to check
&gt;things out thoroughly.  I'm pretty much a novice mechanic, so any
&gt;ideas on what to check or if someone has had a similiar problem,
&gt;your help would be much appreciated.
&gt;
Um, does it have gas?  :)  Seriously, sounds like maybe your fuel pump is
broken or one of the fuel lines came disconnected.  Could also be a clogged
filter.  I'd unhook it at the carb and put the end of the line in a jar and
crank it over a few times and see if any gas comes out.  (Disconnect wire
going to + side first.)  Also, I think if the fuel pump breaks, sometimes
you get gas in your oil, so check the dipstick to see if there's gas on it.
