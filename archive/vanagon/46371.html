Subject: Better change the stats so I'm on the right list!
Date: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 14:44:44 -0600 (MDT)

I have been on the stats before, but last time one came out, I think I've 
been dropped!

My name eavner, and I live in Lubbock, Texas (Howdy, Ya'll).  However, I 
go to school in Tacoma WA, so for the stats, that's probably where I whould
be lsted.  I own a '77 bus named Rasputen.  She got me up to school from 
here, and once I get her running again (air leaks galore!) she'll 
hopefully get me back.

At any rate, please put me on the Aircooled list!

Thanks in advance!

Ben, the occasional sniveling lurker...
