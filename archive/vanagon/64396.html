Erik and all:
The dreaded brake fade! I experienced it also on a long twisty downhill
two lane road that ends up in the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River.
No, I did not roll in. I detected that unmistakable odor of brake pads
but thought it was my friends Volvo in front of me. I was shocked to find
instead it was my crewcab!!!! It happens, be warned.
Drive Safely &amp; Good Luck

&lt;snip&gt; The brakes did act up a little when we were
&gt;leaving and going down a long steep grade following about 30 cars and a
big
&gt;truch out in front. The breakes actually got a little mushy for awhile
