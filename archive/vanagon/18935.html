&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 	I haven't found out for sure, but apparently Dave Kautz has heard

&gt; yet.  If Tamarack Flat campground is closed, that only leaves the
&gt; reservation campgrounds open, and they will be packed.  Suggestions at
&gt; this point would be welcomed (please post or send them to Martha as my
&gt; e-mail access will be sporadic for the rest of the trip).

Hogden Meadows (right at the north-west entrance to the PARK) last year 
also was first come-first save, and I think if you arrive in the 
late morning during the week, you should be able to get a site there...

Hope you will find a place to stay in crowded Yosemite, however, if you 
need a (usually) very lonely campgroud, try Freemont Peak State Park, at 
the end of a small road 'G1' off the town of San Juan Bautista, north-east 
of Monterey. No ranger station, but pay phone, water, pit toilets, and with 
almost 3000ft elevation often in, or above the clouds.

Wish you fun for GNATT's last leg!
