Subject: Why VW T&amp;A....oops Trends is my favorite magazine

Joel Walker posted to the Vanagon list that VW T&amp;A...oops Trends
now has an e-mail address and has now joined the information
highway. I figure we can give them a warm internet &quot;hello&quot; by
producing a Top Ten List entitled &quot;Why VW T&amp;A...oops Trends&quot; is
our favorite magizine. 

I've started the list with 5 of my own. Submit your entries, and
I will come add them to the list, and when there are 10 good
ones, I'll forward them to T&amp;A. Have Fun!


Why VW T&amp;A...oops Trends is My Favorite Magazine


5. Exceeds the U.S. Government's Minimum Daily Requirement of
&quot;Sano Restos&quot;.

4. Average 15 year old motorhead reader laughs uncontrollably
when &quot;head&quot;, &quot;jugs&quot; and &quot;polished cranks&quot; are used in the same
paragraph.

3. Reading level is just right for practicing to pass the reading
section of the G.E.D.

2. At least one feature article per month is written about a
major advertiser. Makes buying decisions real easy!
