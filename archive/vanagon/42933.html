&gt;?? what fiche that VWOA sells? the repair manual? that's the same stuff as
&gt;the bentley book (at least, the one i got was ... and it was only $25 back
&gt;when). imho, the dealers don't use anything ... which is why they can't fix
&gt;the buses. :(

Joel,

When I was at my local VW dealer I picked up a form that requests the free
service bulletins.  On the back of that form is a paragraph with heading:

Service Information On Microfilm

(And it reads like this)

Volkswagen offers for sale all service bulletins covering model years 1985
to present on standard microfiche.  Also available on microfiche are repair
manuals and wiring diagrams.  Prices for individual microfiche sets are
listed in the latest index.  When you order a one-year subscription for
microfiche, you will receive a starter library consisting of all
microfilmed repair manuals (beginning with 1980 model year), wiring
diagrams (from 1982), and service bulletins (from 1985 to present).  The
current proce for a one year subscription including starter set is $85.00.

End of paragraph.

I will have to look at the latest index to see if I can figure exactly what
you get for $85.  I went dumpster diving at work and pulled out a
microfiche reader from the trash so if I knew if this fiche from VW was any
good I may take a chance on a one year subscription or order a manual on
fiche.  I will continue to look into this and let everyone know if its any
good or just a duplication of whats already in book form.
