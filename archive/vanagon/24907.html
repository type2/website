Subject: Tanks

Tanks for all the advice on stuck solonoid.  Think I'll try the Maytag
solution (about my speed of mechanics) first, then the Better Idea if
needed.

Ran into a skunk out running this morning. Second one this week.  Thought
it might be a good substitute for mice in your Diesel.  Wavers could build
a little bench on the passenger seat, too.  40 posts per day. Can't read em
all.  Thx. agin.  Still waiting on Westie engine #8.  Will post results.
