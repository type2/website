Subject: Vanagon Sited in Bosnia

Saw a report about how the supply lines were being cut off between the
airport and the bakery in Sarijevo (sp). Showed an armored vehicle zooming
down a street with a burgandy vanagon (round headlights) snugged right up
next to it, presumably full of supplies headed for the bakery. 

I hope it was aircooled or that they have replaced all the water hoses that
I seem to be splitting recently.
