Subject: parts

just wondering, i talked to my local VW dealership and they told me that 
parts for a 1984 vanagon would be difficult to find, what is the parts 
situation with vans, it should change by region, like in the DC metro area 
(where i stomp around), it probably has half the number of vanagons that are 
in calif. so parts would probably be a problem...  god, shopping for a vw 
vanagon that fits your criteria (which is not too stringent) is tough.
