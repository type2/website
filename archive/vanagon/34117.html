&gt;&gt; Just a data point to consider... My cat was gutted out years ago and I've 

&gt;&gt; never failed a test in Oregon as a result.
&gt;
&gt;AMAZING!
&gt;Hmmmm...  I don't have a cat.  Will disemboweling my sister's dog work as
&gt;well?  Anybody tried this?  (With their own dog, of course, not my
&gt;sister's...)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of course PA emissions could be more stringent. Should I feel guilty?
&gt;
&gt;Well, did you like the cat?

They tend to be tough and stringy. Salt helps.


OK, OK, I'll stop... (ducking thrown veggies)
