&gt; Question:
&gt; 
&gt; I'ee seen prices for water cooled head gasket replacment in the range of $1,500-$2,000 from
&gt; various postings. WOW!
&gt; 
&gt; Why so expensive?  I have not seen what head costs, yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a job that an owner can do with reasonable mechanical skill?
yes, 150$ IS THE GASKET PRICE IF YOU DO IT YOURSELF...
AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THEM IN THE ENGINE...REMOVE ALTNATOR AND PS
PUMP....
