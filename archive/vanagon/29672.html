New 'Brain'-88 Westy (long)

About a year ago I replaced the Ignition Control Unit (a.k.a the brain or
computer) in my 88 Westy.  It was a scary (expensive) thing to do but I thought
I'd share the symptoms, fix and story with the members of the list.

(disclaimer:  the problem I had was SO intermittent that what I call 'educated
guess troubleshooting' was the best I (and the many VW mechanics I spoke with)
could do.  I do NOT recommend randomly replacing expensive FI parts to solve
problems unless you are fairly sure you're barking up the right tree...remember
you CAN'T take electrical parts back if they don't fix the problem!  Hopefully
my story will aid and assist if you're having problems.)

Over a period of about 8 months I began noticing an extremely intermittent cut
out/total loss of power-usually on the freeway but not always.  It felt like
someone reached over and turned the key off for a millisecond or two and then
back on.  No backfire or anything, just a really obvious electrical-problem
feeling miss.  It might occur once in two months and then twice in a day. 
Totally intermittent.  Grrr... 

I began trying to see the 'pattern' when this happened-was it at a certain RPM
(air flow meter?), at a certain temperature (a temp sensor?), during a right
turn (???), radio frequency interference from my new cellular phone?, full moon?,
WHAT is causing this annoying problem?  It began to occur more frequently but
still very intermittently.  All the while I was ranting and raving to friends
and family how much I love my VW...

The problem felt similar to a problem I had on my '79 bus when the air flow
meter was dying and I'd get a major miss at a certain RPM.  Before replacing
anything I checked and rechecked all the electrical connectors in/around the
engine compartment.  I cleaned junk from grounds everywhere I could find them.
After changing only one thing at a time (I HAD to know what this was) the
problem would again raise it's ugly head-always randomly within a week or two. 
I can't tell you how many times I thought I had it fixed. 2x grrrr.

The problem happened with a different coil, new air flow meter, different hall
unit in the distributor, new spark plug wires, cap and rotor.  I replaced temp
sensor II and the relay that supplies power to the brain.  Still, the problem
recurred.  I drove around with a volt meter on my dash and wires running
everywhere to see if I could see a random voltage drop.  I probably watched that
voltmeter more than I watched where I was driving!  If I had had to pay someone
labor to figure this one out it woulda cost a zillion dollars.  Never mind the
parts!  Grrrr 3x.

Every time I talked to someone about the problem (both VW service people and
not-I didn't know about 'the list' yet) I would ask if there was any way the
control unit could be causing the problem.  One guy at Ron Price VW in South San
Francisco, CA (I believe he was the service MANAGER) said he had NEVER seen any
electrical problem fixed by changing a control unit.  He then went on to tell me
that the only way he would even consider working on this problem on my van was
(in addition to full labor charges) if I brought him a bottle of his favorite
red wine and a cellular phone so he could call someone if he got stuck.  I've
had so much bad advice from Ron Price-I'd strongly recommend NOT doing business
with them (off soapbox-flaming over).

Rodrigo at Gandalf's Garage in South San Francisco was extremely helpful through
the troubleshooting stages.  He suggested many electrical tests and was kind
enough to loan me 'know working' parts whenever possible.  I can't thank he and
his wife Gretchen enough.  I sent them a cake when I finally got it fixed!

Finally after about 6 months of troubleshooting, volt meter in hand and exasperated
I replaced my control unit. What a difference!!!  One service guy at a dealer in
Walnut Creek said there were 4 revisions of the brain and the they were
constantly 'tinkering' with the firmware to increase power and fuel economy.  My
observations agree- more power for sure, BETTER gas mileage (2-3+mpg) and best
of all no more intermittent weirdness!!!  I've driven over 10k miles without a
burp. Ahhh 10,000,000x

In retrospect there's only one thing I would have done differently.  When I put
the new computer in, I took the old one apart to see what made it tick.  Inside
I found a bunch of corroded connections and a cold solder joint or two.  If I
had it to over again I woulda taken my soldering iron to the sucker first...

I hope nobody EVER has to go through this one again,
