Subject: Joint Thoughts

With recent tread on cv joints, grease, and sockets I would like to add
my thoughts...
 
&gt;From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;likewise. thus far, i had been so shocked at the galling and burning in the
&gt;joints i had taken off and cleaned, that i just replaced them all. now that
&gt;the dealer wants $130 EACH for a joint and boot, and the FLAPS wants $100
&gt;for the same, i might just try to make these last another 75,000 miles.

&gt;I don't know what it is about cv joints, but when I hear
&gt;them starting to knock, my stomach twists and I become
&gt;awfully crabby.  There only bits o' metal but they have
&gt;a powerful effect on my pysche.

I have worked on cv joints for several years on various vehicles.  When they
start to make noise and start to tear up it's because of the grease drying up.
I don't know if its because of changing quality, loads, engine heat, etc. but
I have not found a trend yet.  I also don't know if there is a problem with
FLAPS using other aftermarket parts but I always use Lobro cv joints and
grease.  Even the Lobro grease will dry up.

It used to be that when a joint went bad I would replace it and that was it.
Now I get into the habit of looking at all of the joints and just checking
them to be sure.  I think that it should be part of regular maintenance of
checking the joints instead of waiting until the damage is done.  If a joint
is not badly damage I have been able to extend its life by cleaning up and 
repacking it.  I have done this several times.  I did this on my rabbit truck
(the noises were LOUD especially driving for 50 miles) and got 20K miles out
of one bad joint before replacing it.  I have not tried flipping the joints
around but it seems to be a good idea.

&gt;Before you begin, you may want to check all the bolts you will be 
&gt;removing.  I did the CV joints on one of my bugs and found hex-head bolts 
&gt;on one side and star bolts on the other.  In an emergency, I am told you 
&gt;can drive the wrong tool into the bolt head and it will work.... (YUCK!)
&gt;Better to look before you leap. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;    be sure to have a set of vise grips handy. some bolts may not want
&gt;&gt;    to come off the joint (being already rounded out from before).
&gt;
&gt;I never got this to work.  I eventually had a freind with an arc welder 
&gt;weld a grade 8 bolt to the head and used a socket to finish the job.
                                                            
Yes, the wrong socket will work if you hammer it in.  I have done it on an old
rabbit.  Just be sure that you get replacement bolts.  Vise grips will work
too.  It is easier if you can do that and turn it with the hex or star socket
at the same time.

BTW, does anybody have any problems with bolts coming slack?  It seems that I
have to tighten them again after some use.
