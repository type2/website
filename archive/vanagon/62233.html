Would all self-destructive, incompetent or insane people please go on to the 
next message?
Thank you.

Now for the three of you who are left:

It was suggested that pointing out that 

         using Propane as a refrigerant in A/C systems is dangerous and 
illegal 

might give someone the idea to try it, instead of dissuading them as intended.

Now my question:

Do we have a greater moral obligation to such people to protect from their own 
stupidity, or to the human race to allow nature to take its course?

Tom
