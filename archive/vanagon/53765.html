Subject: VW Vendors List

Hey, you vanagonaddicts! Long time no e-!

Just a note to let you know that I've reformatted the VW Vendor's List so
it'll load easier and looks better. The URL changed slightly. It's still not
fancy, but with well over 300 vendors listed, it should be a valuable
resource for contact info.  If you maintain a web page, please feel free to
add a link pointing to the list.

VW Vendor's Page: http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~jfournier/vwvends.html

I've also started adding Web Links and I've started on a personal home page.

My Home Page: http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~jfournier/

I'll probably be working on it some more today, adding graphics I horked
from other spots on the web and stuff like that. It'll be a while before I
can upload pictures of my bus.

Keep those local shops, vendors, and updated info coming!

Thanks! Joe
