Calling all vanheads
Does anyone out in vanagonland have any experience with the Mexiwatercooled?
I mean the one built on the Type I chassis with the radiator in frnt. What
engine? What models? Importable? Anything at all. I have seen hundreds on
the road in Mexico, had the chance for a cursory look at a Westfalia owned
by a Clevelander but other than that the vehicle is a mystery.
I ask because I may like to have one for our 2-3 months in Mexico each year.
Will NAFTA require it to have NoAmer standards?

Any info appreciated

Thanks

Leo
