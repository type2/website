 &gt;  Joel, you've actually swapped them, right? What did you figger?

 va&gt; well ... cause it seemed like a good idea at the time. :)
 va&gt; actually, i'm wondering if it will make any difference. there was No
 va&gt; Clear Consensus from the list (or anywhere else), so i'm gonna see if
 va&gt; they last another 75,000 miles this way. if they do, it doesn't prove
 va&gt; anything. but if they tear up, i'm sure gonna suspect something!!! :)

 va&gt; i'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, by reversing the axles, that the
 va&gt; balls will move into new wear areas of the races ... and so maybe last
 va&gt; longer (instead of wearing the old paths even deeper). no basis in
 va&gt; science or history supports this claim, however.

Actually, if memory serves, this is recommended practice in the Muir
Rabbit book.
