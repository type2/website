&gt; My only complaint with Gerry coming back is that the numbers appear at the
&gt; head of the list, but do not appear on the individual posts. Cna we get
&gt; these back a la vanagon.lenti? It may be only me but it makes it much
&gt; easier to spin through.

  second the motion on numbers also on individual posts, for exact same
reason. cheers...
