Well,
I've owned two '73 buses in the past, and now we currently own two vanagons
and a '93 EV.  I could have told you that I would expect this exact reaction
from an aircooled owner anytime.  There is too much contrast.  There is not
as big a difference between the Vanagons and the 73-79 buses.

One appreciates the EV after you drive a couple of the so-called minivans.  So
far, I've driven Chryslers and a Ford Windstar.  Both plush, top-of-the-line.
Then one understands how great a car the EV is.  Spacious, the 5spd. 5cyl.
Audi engine is adequate (if not powerful) and responsive, and the handling is
very solid.  It just does not have the 'character' earlier buses had.  On 
the opposite side, the Chryslers and the Windstar are powerful (6cyl.),
but they lack 'spirit' (now how do I explain this?).  My wife calls them
'bar soap' -- too mushy.  They also clearly lack the responsive feeling
one gets from the 5spd. transmission.  The EV is a delight in turns and braking
compared to these minivans.

As opposed to the earlier buses/vanagons, the EV has decidedly more power,
more softie-type amenities (like two heaters and two A/C units).  It is
somewhat more aerodynamic (I've tested this -- there's a downhill on I-78
that my '87 Vanagon barely keeps the same speed when I put it in neutral.
the EV actually speeds up downhill when I put the EV in neutral).


All said, I still drive the '87, not the EV.  Admittedly a little because
we're afraid my wife would not know what to do with it if she got
stuck on the road, but I think I also like the 'character' of the '87
a little more...
