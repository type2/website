Subject: Re: Getting A Key Cut From The Lock Code - '65 Type II


Getting a key shouldn't be all that difficult assuming the locksmith
or your dealer has the code book and key cutter. Hell, I just got
a spare key for my '56 bug from my local VW dealer.._dot_called him
gave him the code number, and when I got there voila...a key!
