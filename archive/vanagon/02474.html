&gt;&gt;anybody ever do this?  i've always been somewhat curious about the airflow
&gt;&gt;around the buses (all years) and always wanted to attach those little tufts
&gt;&gt;of wool to the outside, like they do in the windtunnels, and go driving
&gt;&gt;down the highway ... and have someone with a camcorder film the bus. :)

It's been done, I'll try to get the reference for this out. I think it's in 
an aerodynamics textbook, Schlichtings &quot;Boundary Layer Theory&quot; published in 
the sixties. 3 photos of an early model bus carved out of wood, in a wind 
tunnel. #1 was plain bus with lots of highly disturbed tufts or ribbons. #2 
was with the side windows smoothed over I think, and #3 was a smoothed in 
nose fairing, full width,  from the windshield down. Major turbulence seen 
along the sides in #1 + 2, nice smooth flows along #3 sides.
If you wanted to put your spare tire, bits and pieces up front, #3 looked great.

Aside: in my '72 Westy I used to open the drivers door on the highway at 60 
mph, (hey, I never claimed to be a gifted child!) Anyhow, the doors stayed 
steadily open about 2&quot; and could not be pulled shut easily. They also 
couldn't be pushed/held open much wider. To close them I had to push/pull 
quick to get some momentum for closing. The doors were lining up with the 
bow wave off the front, preventing what is known as 'seperation' in the 
aerodynamics field, where the flow pulls away from a curved surface and 
generates turbulence. The nose fairing in the pictures does the same thing, 
smooths out the streamlines around the front corners. Don't try this at home 
kids!    tim s.
