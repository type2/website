&gt; Okay, living in a pristine wilderness does have a couple of drawbacks.  One

&gt; So...  Does anyone have a source for L/H drill bits.  Either mail-order or
&gt; maybe a local source and you could mail it to me??  I need to remove a
&gt; broken 6mm screw, so I suspect that something around 1/8&quot; would do.  If you
&gt; have any suggestions, please drop me a line.
