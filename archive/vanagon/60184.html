Subject: Re:  Manassas BUG OUT #38 listmember &quot;get together&quot;

Hi Volks,
    I'm going to the Manassas Bug Out. My bus will be in the show, its a
freshly painted Irovy camper with a LiMBO Banner hanging from it.  I'll
also be wearing a Black 'Generations of Innovations Summit '96' Hat. If
anyone see me, stop me and say hi.  I'll try to stop by Rons Bus at 1pm
as well.   If your about and about in Manassas either Saturday or Sunday
nite, I'm also staying at the Hampton Inn near the Shoneys Restaurant. 
I've never had good luck camping out in the Manassas area so we decieded
to motel it.  Well, I hope to meet a few people down there this
weekend.  Take care.
