Subject: Short circuit/fire is ecu dead?

well, i have searched the archives and havent come up with anyone else
making as DUMB of a mistake as me...

i put in a battery to test my compression on my 80 v'gon and hopped in to
turn it over.  Nothing happened.  I then said hmm to myself and walked
back to the rear looking to see what the problem was. there was huge
clouds of smoke coming out from under the airbox.  I ran to get something
insulated to unhook the battery with.  Having succeeded i then looked
closer to see what the problem was.

i had used a battery (sidepost with regular posts attached to the sidepost
holes) and it sat there with + and - reversed.  I had attatched the
battery backwards!!  

so, the wire between the alternator and the solenoid is without
insulation.  the insulation was the source of the billows of smoke!

with the battery hooked up properly and the bare wire shielded, the car
will not turn over.

i am guessing that the starter solenoid and the alternator are in bad
shape!

my big concern is, however, the ECU.  In the bently much reference is made
to never jumping or charging the car with the wires attatched. the ecu is
very sensitive.  

i am afraid with all of teh other problems to fix, this may be the end of
my vanagon.  (after runing for 20 minutes the plugs are pretty fouled,
rusty and needs heads rebuilt)

*sigh*

may my stupidity be a lesson to all to be careful with electricity and
that converted sidepost batteries will have the posts reversed.
 
grateful that the car didnt blow up taking me with it,
