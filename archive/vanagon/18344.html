WELCOME TO BOARD!!!

I know what you are going through.  I, too, am doing a '72 Westy.  In case
you haven't noticed, the prices for that 1700cc range from high to
outrageous.  What I paid for the entire exhaust system on my diesel Rabbit
(except manifold) would not buy one heat exchanger for the Westy.  Right now
I am almost finished with the 1700cc and ready to do the rewiring to fix a
butcher job.

Well, the Westy calls.  Keep us posted about the Westy!
