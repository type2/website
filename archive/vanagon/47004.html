Subject: 84 Electrical-Fusible Link?

Vanagoneers:

Simple question:  Where is the fusible link?

A few months ago I drove into my garage, turned off the Vanagon
and heard a muffled *pop* sound.  It was raining so everything
was wet.  Came out the next morning and Vanagon won't start.  I
had no time to track it down, called my local (good) mechanic for
tow/fix.  Checked later that day...all done...just a corroded
fusible link that burned out, was replaced and off I go.

Well...we got a lot of rain yesterday, Vanagon won't start again.
This time I have time to putter (driving the '67), so I check
myself.  No spark to plug.  No spark from coil.  I ask
myself...could this be that fusible link again?

I have Bentley.  I track the &quot;ignition&quot; portion of the wiring
diagram.  I see connections to fuses in the fuse panel, but no
fusible link.  I trust my mechanic, but don't know where else to
look.  Call me con-fusible.
