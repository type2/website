Subject: Re: Can I replace a Solex 28 PICT with 30 PICT 2?

&gt; My 1961 40 hp SAE bus was converted to 12 volts by the P.O. As a result, I
&gt; have no choke. I can't seem to locate a replacement element which will fit
&gt; this carb. I tried tracking down an element used on the earlier ambulances
&gt; and firetrucks which were converted to 12 volts, but no luck.  Now I 'm
&gt; wondering if I could use a spare 30 PICT 2 I have in the cellar. This has
&gt; the correct 12 volt element, and would seem to be a solution. But is it
&gt; realistic, or will other problems surface?
&gt; I do have a spacer plate which will allow the carb to fit the manifold.

You could run a 36hp Solex 28 with the jets out of you 61's.  These had a 
manual choke and you'd have to add the choke cable some how.  The 30 
Solex does need an adapter.  You could make one out of a carb flange of 
an old manifold.  Just make sure you flatten it out with a file.  The air 
cleaner fits fine.  Other clearances are ok, it'll just sit about 7mm higher.
