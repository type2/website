&gt; Hiya All,
&gt; 
&gt; Last time I was at the farm to check up on the resting 
&gt; beast I noticed a small pool of oil forming on the 
&gt; ground on the drivers side of the engine near the front
&gt; (front is front).  This pool only forms with the engine
&gt; running.  The suspect:  Blown oil cooler seal.
&gt; Now, how much would a new oil cooler run me?  Gasket set?
&gt; I presume that the engine must be removed in order to 
&gt; perform this service.  Correct?  ('74 II)  Btw, I get
&gt; the impression that the engine has to come out for any
&gt; and every kind of service.  I'm surprised that we don't
&gt; have to drop it when we change the oil...  Sigh...  I'm
&gt; also wondering if dropping the engine can be done by one
&gt; guy (no gender specificity).  --Ralf (gutteral 'R')
&gt; 
&gt; 
  If it has a type IV motor, and I don't know if canadian buses do, and it's 
  leaking at the front of the engine then it's not the oil cooler. The type
  IV oil cooler is at the left rear of the engine, behind cylinder #4. You
  can see a bit of it from underneath. I'd be more suspicious of a leaky
  pushrod tube seal or rocker cover - Neither of which requires removing the
  engine to repair.
