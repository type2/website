Subject: What would you do?


Howdy,

If you were in this, what would you do?

A '83 water-cooled with 113k miles starts showing signs of
bad headgaskets. It will cost $1,200 to replace the gaskets.
Besides either selling it or replacing the gaskets, what
other reasonable option does the owner have? 

VW claims that they will not be responsible for this problem
(even it is a well-known design flaw) for pre-1985 with 80k+ miles
Vanagons. Does the owner still have any recourse?

Thanks for your comments.

Regards,
James
