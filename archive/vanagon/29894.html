Subject: '81 2.0L AFC rebuild questions

I have heard of a book called 'How to Rebuild your VW air-cooled
engine' by Tom Wilson, lemme know if it answers these questions
and I'll order it :)

I have disassembled my '81 vanagon engine all the way, and expect
to be reassembling in mid-Decmeber (brrrr).  I have new cylinders,
pistons, rings (a Brazilian set), heads being done by Mark Stephens
(total of about $460 after welding the 6 cracks! yikes!  A wonder
I still have valve seats in those things...), cam/lifters re-machined by
Weber, crankshaft by Temple's, a local VW-capable machine shop.

Questions that are making me nervous:

- the two front cylinders had 60 &amp; 90 lbs compression and the engine
burned a quart of oil with every 20 gals of gas, and the
heads aren't responsible, Mark Stephens tells me.  The cylinders
_look_ ok, the original hone marks are still there, no huge overhang
at the top... lots of gunk in the oil ring slots is all.  No broken
rings... any ideas?  Didn't measure anything or even keep the piston/
cylinder pairs together, oops :(  I assumed it would be obvious...
oops again.

- the distributor-end of the crank has some kind of distributor
gear thing on it that I can't get off.  Do I need to have
the shop that checks the crank put on the new bearing for me so
they can press the gear back on?

- is re-assembly something like: put in the crank and cam and
rods and button up the case, now try to get the cylinders/pistons
on one by one?  This sounds tough... my new cylinders/pistons are
already assembled, am I going to be able to get them on without
re-compressing the rings?  Not enough space there for MY ring
compressor...

- how oh how do you get the piston pins on the connecting rods
without beating on them and thereby possibly trashing the rod
bearings?  I know that's how I got 'em off :(  Although I did it
gently with stuff braced against them...

- do you use permatex or something between case halves?

- there was a lifter which was often noisy; could it have wrecked
its push rod?  They all look ok, and I never knew which one was
the noisy one... hopefully it'll be healed when Weber cleans them...

- and finally, a no-longer-quite-so-relevant question but one
which I sure wish I'd known the answer to at one a.m. while attempting
to remove the engine: how do you get the back bolt off the clutch
slave cylinder?  I did but it was pure luck... and took 2 hours.

Any sources of hints on this process that you'd like to recommend?
I rebuilt lots of 60's fords 20 years ago, but vw's are a whole
new scene.

Many thanks to anyone willing to tackle all these questions :)
