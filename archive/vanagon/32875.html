 Martha,

 You woulda loved that Coleman catalytic heater! I used to have one and 
 here's how you light it: Pour raw Coleman fuel over the catalytic &quot;felt&quot;,
 put a match to it and STAND BACK. This is to get the catalyst hot enough to 
 work which leads to your real question....

 A catalytic heater is one which burns something, ie. combustion takes place. 
 The introduction of the catalyst allows combustion to take place at a lower
 temperature, namely lower than one at which flames are present. So although
 gas or propane is being burned, you don't see it. It just sits there being
 hot, invisibly burning white gas or whatever.

 Radiant heating has less to do with the heat source and more to do with how
 the heat is dispersed. Picture one of these glowing electric heat elements:
 If there is no fan to move the air heated by it towards you, most of the
 heat you feel from it came as infra-red radiation. You can be sure that the
 air directly above this heater is hot and became so by convection - as air
 is heated it rises. When a fan is added, air heated by the element is 
 circulated and makes the air near you warmer, which in turn warms you up.
 Essentially the air has &quot;carried&quot; the heat from the element to you. This is
 usually referred to as &quot;forced convection&quot;. 

 These types of heat transfer are not mutually exclusive. A fan assisted 
 will also radiate heat just as a radiant heater will always cause some 
 natural convection &lt;air movement just because it is heated&gt; to occur.

 By the way, although you can't see the catalytic heater burning, they still
 are using up just as much oxygen so all the concerns about proper ventilation
 are still very pertinant.
