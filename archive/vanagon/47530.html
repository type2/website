Subject: Vacation Plans: MI, WI, IL,BBTA?

Well, vacation time is coming up next month. We want
to work our way west in the Syncro Westie to Busses By The Arch, and we 
were thinking that it might be interesting to head east to Michigan,
drive north along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan,
cross to the Upper Penninsula, then down the western side
of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin, and then head for St.Louis.

We are looking for a leisurely trip here, with time for our six
year old to ride his bike, hike, and hit the beaches - I know 
the water is very cold - .

Does anyone with local knowlege have any hints or suggestions: like,
is this a bad idea, insane giant mosquitos, grueling heat, etc.

TIA, 

Tom F.
