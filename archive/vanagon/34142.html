Yeah - these are my VW guys and usually do me right, though I do feel
I've gotten some somewhat slapdash service lately, as they've gotten
busier and busier. They did a two-valve head job on Da Rust Bucket ('77
AutoLoaf) for $600 bucks a couple of years ago and are now official
custodians of Da Stud Bucket ('89 Syncro GL), having replaced the boots
on my front CVs most recently.  I would recommend them, though I think
they're better for air-cooled vans.  

(BTW, Peter just bought a beater Syncro and is planning to fix it up -
the Santa Cruz Syncronaut population is definitely growing: at least 2
Syncro Westies and 5 non-Westy Syncros that I know about or have seen
around town.)
