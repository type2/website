Subject: help alinging early bus door

i just hung the drivers door on my bus the other day.  it went on fine 
and even ligned up good.  however, when i put the top glass frame on, it 
would not close.  the top frame hits the door post on the upper back 
portion of the frame.  i can get it so that it clears by about 1/16 of a 
inch, but it is hard to close because of the rubber seal.  the front of 
the upper window fram has about 3/8 of an inch clearance.  it seams to me 
that the whole unit needs to slide forward about 1/4 inches, but there is 
no way to do that.  can anyone out there offer some words of advice?  
thanks and God BLess
matt
