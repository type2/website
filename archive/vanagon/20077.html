&gt;   I was driving to work in my bug years back (worked nights), car of
&gt;   surfers driving ahead of me (about four car lengths)... saw one of
&gt;   their boards become airborne, got some pretty decent altitude, spinning
&gt;   and tumbling and it occurs to me &quot;that thing is going to come through
&gt;   my windshield and kill me dead&quot; -- good time for a lane change.
&gt; 
&gt;   Couple/three miles down the road I passed the surfers, puzzled look and
&gt;   absurd baggy swim trunks wonderin' where their stick was, dude.
&gt; 
&gt;   All in all, I was happy not to have been skewered by the thing...

Reminds me of the time I put my water ski on top of the car while opening 
the door, got in and drove a few blocks around the lake to my friends 
house, stopped and reached back to pull out the ski...what ski? Got out 
of the car with that sinking feeling. Surprise it was still there, livin 
right i guess.
