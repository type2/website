Subject: dashboard fan / AC

I received a Sharper Image catalog and they have some snazzy $24
4 &quot;D&quot; cell powered desk fan... I'm wondering if that would work better?

I've seen RV/Camper catalogs with all manner of A/C units... couldn't
quite figure out how I'd rationalize installing a generator to run
the air conditioner and still get the Zenmobile to move with the
additional weight... sure liked the idea, though!!!

Not worth it.  I had one on the '82 diesel Westy, I got rid of it.
Shakes, rattles, and does not put out any breeze that's worthwhile.

I'd like to find out how good those electrically powered top-mounted
A/C units in the J.C. Whitney Catalog are.  They cost less than $400.00
and look like they can be made to fit on the top front where they left the
space to tie down stuff, etc..
