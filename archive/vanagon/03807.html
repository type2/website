To anyone who can help,

    I have had my '86 Vanagon (87000 miles)(synchro, westy) since '88.  
Roughly from the time I purchased it, the motor randomly cuts out but does
not usually die completely,  a somewhat violent occurrence, especially under
load.  I have tried various dealerships, under warrantee, but got no real 
solutions.  The ECU was replaced once.  I gave up trying to solve the 
problem as it is intermittent.  Recently, after subscribing to this group 
heard about the wire-harness patch.  I installed the patch and it did not 
stop the unpleasantries. 

    Do I continue to live with the hiccupping or are there any suggestions?
I dread having to start replacing parts with hopes of solving the problem.

Help.... Thanks.
