Subject: 90 lurching on highway

I have a 90 Carat that also seems to lurch occasionally when I am on the 
highway though, not while in traffic.  It also seems to be when I am being
&quot;lazy&quot; on the gas, if I accelerate it goes away, likewise if I just let it 
coast.  This only really happens though after I go up a big hill and start 
heading down or leveling off.  So I guess I've got the same question, and
that is, any ideas?
