Subject: microwaves


I realized I failed to respond to Wagner Michael's suggestion to take
up a collection to get a microwave for me.  Good news:  I already 
have one!  It's .3 cubic feet, and 400 watts, and I expect one day
to be able to make popcorn in it with an inverter.  I wouldn't
have believed this possible until I saw it with my own eyes when
David Schwarze did it in the wilderness (i.e. NO hookups) at Lassen
Park.  

Now, all I need is about $2K worth of high-powered solar panels, a
1500 watt inverter, about 4-8 golf-cart batteries, and 2 miles of
wire.  Of course, you realize with all this extra weight that I unfortunately
won't be able to attend any future vanagon bashes, as the car simply
won't move with all this aboard.  But I guess we can always
have the parties here.  You all bring the food - I'll nuke it.
