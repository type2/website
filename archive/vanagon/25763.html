Subject: BARNDOOR LEAD!!! (buses FS)


Got a call last night about 11:00 from a local friend.  He had just 
gotten a call from a friend in central Florida.  There is a 54 Kombi 
available in Miami.

Details are sketchy at this point, but I am sending a friend to take 
a few pictures for me.  So far the only info I have is one dogleg 
needs to be replaced, but it is mostly complete.

I am seriously considering taking on this adventure, if I can raise 
the revenue.  Three buses are now on the block:

1966 Hardtop Deluxe  Sea Blue/Cumulus White, 1600 SP w/doghouse 
	cooler, new brake master &amp; wheel cylinders, new brake
	hoses, new seals in reduction boxes, new seals in popout 
	windows and windshields, new front seat covers.

1966 Non poptop Westfalia  needs paint, wheel wells cut, walk-thru, 
	complete interior except folding table between seats (may
	have one in parts Westy picking up this weekend), 1600 SP.

1968 Westfalia  Pearl White, below beltline painted Titian Red (not 
	well), 1600 DP w/doghouse cooler, complete interior (even 
	cot &amp; rear mosquito net), came with gas heater (currently 
	not installed but may go with the bus).

I am located just north of Atlanta, GA.  SERIOUS inquiries will be 
answered.

If it looks like I won't be able to follow thru with the 54, I'd
be happy to pass the lead on to someone else on the list.  Be
aware that this would be a SERIOUS restoration project (READ $$$).

Happy hunting!

Dave
