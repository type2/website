&gt; bus cake: a friend once made me a birthday cake, in the shape and color of

&gt; was a bitch ... really messed up your teeth! :)

My wife and I (before she was divorced &lt;grin&gt; ) headed out West in a Blue 
Chevy panel van.  One of our trip symbols was the otter.  So, on her next 
birthday, I had the bakery make a cake with a Blue Van with an otter in 
front of it.  It was phenomenal.  This baker didn't even blink an eye. 
Clerk to me: &quot;Ya....Ya... Ok. What color was that van&quot;? 
Clerk yelling back to the kitchen: &quot;JOE!! WE NEED A NUMBER 37 BLUE&quot;
&lt;grin&gt;
Happy New Year.

You all need to learn the traditional toast in Slovenia:

Nice Driveway!!
