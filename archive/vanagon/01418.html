Hello everyone!

in regards to heating a cold bus, I put a bilge blower inline in my heater
tubing just forward of where the tubes come together.  I also cut a hole
in the interior and coupled that to the heater intake.  These two mods
served to give me as much air as I wanted, flowing through the HE and
recirculating the air from the inside of the van instead of the stinky air
above the engine.

With the Porche engines, i ran into this when I helped my pal do a engine
swap.  It seemed that there were two schools of thought in this matter. 
There was the school that wanted the neatest unique engine around and
there was the school that opted for durability and practicality but ended
up creating a vehicle that wasn't all that neat.  A person in town put a
racing engine in his bus that cost him around $3000.  This was really
neat.  he would race all over town until he blew the darn thing because it
was a racing engine.  Another person put a chevy small block v8 in his
vehicle and ended up with a vehicle that was stylistically a nightmare.  I
think this VW is still putting around.  I think the v8 mod cost around
$1600 inclusive.  I guess I'm still smarting from the treatment I received
at the hands of a bunch of VW purists when I was helping with these
projects and so, perhaps I have an unreasonable peevishness about putting
porche engines in VW busses.  

I hear the local VW dealer will put in a new 2.2 H2O for $1995 with
exchange.
