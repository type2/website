Subject:      Re: Sagging on one side - Westys

&gt;I was thinking of a stranger option. What about adding a set of air
&gt;shocks in the rear and having 2 valves ( 1 for each shock ) then just
&gt;add 20-30 lbs more pressure in the left shock for the added weight. It
&gt;would let you level the car with any load. Has anyone tried this? What
&gt;will it do to handling (if you can call it that in a vanagon)?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Okay gang. Tell me to what degree of craziness this idea is:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have a liberal Westy (It leans to the left). (1988, 104K miles) It is
&gt;&gt;noticeable when the van is empty, more so when the water tank is full.  My
&gt;&gt;thinking is that the left springs have sagged a bit because of the extra
&gt;&gt;weight.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, what would happen if I got a spring compressor and swapped the springs
&gt;&gt;left to right? The weaker left springs would go on the right. Would this
&gt;&gt;have the result of leveling out the Van?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Or is this an exercise in futility?
&gt;&gt;
