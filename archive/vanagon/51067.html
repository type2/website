Subject: Re: Vanagon Realities

&gt; I subscribed to this list a week ago in order to help my wife and I make
&gt; some decisions regarding which avenue to take on our future travel plans.
&gt; We are intending to take a little drive around Canada (maybe the U.S. too if
&gt; we're desperate for sunshine)for a year within the next 4 to 6 months.  We
&gt; would be doing this on an artist(me)/writer(wife) budget which should make
&gt; it more interesting but also limiting in some ways.  Our first choice in
&gt; vehicles has been a Vanagon but I'd like some realistic opinions from you
&gt; people:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.- reading my mail I see lots of mention of new engines, costly repairs,
&gt; oil leaks, lack of power, stalling, and furnaces.  Are these the exceptions
&gt; or the rule.  I realize that there are about 500 people on this list so
&gt; maybe my apprehension is unwarranted.

Most Vanagons are aging. All aging vehicles have problems.  The newer the 
less problems (usually).  For highest reliabilty go for a Eurovan instead 
of a Vanagon but that puts much more initial vehicle expense in the 
budget.  For much lower initial cost - particularly if mechanically 
inclined go even older for the air cooled buses.  Vanagon is between the 
two in time and values.

If you mean driving around in Canada in the winter(?!?!) go with the 
newer vans.  Some complaints about the heater in the Winnie Eurvan have 
been expressed.  The regular EV is great - but not much of a &quot;home&quot;.

&gt; 2.- is the size of a Vanagon going to be too confining over that length of
&gt; time?  

Personal answer.  Some thrive.  Some don't.  Laundry is among the biggest 
problems.

&gt; 3.- would we be wiser looking at some other R.V.(haven't seen any that
&gt; appeal) considering our limited budget or is the Vanagon going to do the
&gt; job? 

Well if you had too much money the Rialta appeals to some - a VW EV cab 
with a Winnebago back end but have a feeling that is WAY out f your 
&quot;starving artists&quot; budget.  Its out of my &quot;well paid software engineer&quot; 
budget too.

&gt;4.- it is obvious that you really like your VW's.  Are they really good
&gt; or do your biases help you do overlook some of their drawbacks.

I like VW vans because of the incredible good times I had growing up 
traveling in a '69 and later '72 Westfalia camper.  It was the quality of 
the vehicle that led to the biases.  '72 wasn't in particular a good year 
for buses though.  We had 5 of us for 3 to 4 weeks at a time living in 
that bus - though we had the side tent to keep us somewhat sane.  Not 
as necessary for only two.
