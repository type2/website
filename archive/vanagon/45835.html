I personally haven't had any dealings with WW but many of the repro WCM
rubber items i have purchased (rear door seal, engine lid trim and front
door &quot;scrapers&quot; etc.) were all WAY to stiff and consequently made shutting
the rear door engine lid front door etc. a ROYAl pain in the arse. Just my
$0.03 I would personally defer to NOS if the opportuninty presents itself
and there isn't a huge price diff.
