Subject: Transmission question

All,

I have a Thing(yes, I know, not a bus)but, I have the transmission from a bus,
I think, I has four CV boots(two separate axels,I guess). This would be my
guess for the IRS type suspension, for I know that the transaxel type would
have only 2 CV joints,right?

My question is actually 2 questions:
1) When asking for parts, how do I determine the year of the Trans?(I did not
do the work, and the person who did, is uneudcated os far as VWs are concerned,
and unreachable)

2) I need to raise the rear by about 1/2&quot;. What can I do?


Thanks,

David
