Subject:       query:cylinder replacement

My 71 westy camper with a mexican (1600, dual port) motor and an 
unknown number of miles is in pieces and i'm putting them back 
together.

One cylinder and piston were scarred. The cylinder is among the 
missing.  As i look at the damaged piston sitting on a table i see a 
round port for a pin to connect to the the rod. This circle is gouged 
above and in the shape of a crescent moon. Actually both circles in 
the piston, on either end of the pin have this crescent gouge on top 
of the piston.  The rings and piston in between are also 
scratched but i suspect some dage here removng the piston. Evidence 
shows the motor ran on three cyliders. Oh..the cylinder was 
apparently was scored but i have not seen it.  This 
seems to be the only motor damage.

Query:

1. This is a tough one but for curiosity what might have caused this 
type of damage described above. 

2. I am debating replacing one cylinder and piston versus all four 
simultaneously or purchasing a complete rebuild kit (i.e. valves 
cyliders etc).  I am curious for past experience making this 
kinda decision.  Is replacing one cylinder and piston a mistake?
