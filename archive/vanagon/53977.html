&gt;JC's is a large mail order firm. They have their store in Chicago. I have
&gt;delt with them on and off for years with no major problems, (by phone &amp;
&gt;mail). They deal in car parts &amp; anything you might remotely think of as a
&gt;car part!

Could anyone give me the JC's address,
Thanks
