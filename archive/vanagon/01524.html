Subject: Leaky pushrod tubes...who changes oil?
Date: Mon, 4 Jul 1994 19:56:36 -0700 (PDT)

The discussion of oil change intervals brings me to the question of 
pushrod tube seals fairly quickly.  I seem to change my oil every 
thousand miles (out the tubes, in the filler).

Is there a long term solution to these (*&amp;$(% items?  I seem to change 
mine every six months with fair results at best. I just did all of them two 
weeks ago and three started leaking again right off the bat. HELP!

BTW, is there a FAQ?  Where?

                                         Thanks,
                                         Steve Dolan
