Subject: baja update


Serious news - our two leaders, Steve Reilly and Dave Garth are
probably going to have to back out of the Baja trip, due to last
minute work/schedule changes beyond their control.  This leaves
about 20 cars, and if memory serves correctly, hardly any of
us have any knowledge of Mexico/Baja, Spanish, etc.  Decision time -
do we want to:

1.  Go to Baja/Mexico another time when the experts can be there?
2.  Still go anyway?
3.  Go during the same time slot, but maybe to the mountains or elsewhere
    in California instead?
4.  Other ideas?
