Subject: FS 87GL  Houston Area

Volks,
My friend has acquired an 87GL and will not keep it for it is standard.
He just found an auto and his wife and mine agree that automatics are a
good thing. Here's the particulars:
87GL
Red w/Silver stripe: paint excellent no dings -whatsoever- other than
the highway chips on the nose. Orig paint and apparently garaged
entirely
4sp, A/C working very well (this is Texas)
105k miles
Grey interior very nice (excellent?)
Aftermarket soundsystem sounds great
Power windows/Power Mirrors
No drips, Runs great
Alloy Wheels
$4,900 OBO
Needs:
a) rear hatch thumblatch is stuck and probably needs to be replaced
b) tires will go for a while, new ones needed in near future

Overall this vehicle is probably as close to new condition I have ever
seen. The orig paint is immaculate other than small rock chips on the
nose.
I'm in the Houston area, if anyone is interested let me know ASAP for
the local VW shop owner wants it and I will sell it to him within a few
days if no one on the list expresses interest. The owner is one of my
best friends and he wants me to sell it for him ASAP.
I am thinking about this one myself, it is that nice. Garage space at a
premium, something would have to go.
