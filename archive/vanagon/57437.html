Dave, your timing is impeccable.  At 11:00 PM last night, I fixed the
light on my digital clock on my 90 Vanagon.

Not that hard, but takes time.  Remove cover over gauge cluster by
pulling up from back (near windshield).  May have to jiggle a little,
then rock forward and remove.  Next, unplug brake fluid reservoir wire
and remove clear plastic shield.  Then, you will need to remove the
gauge cluster.  This is held by 4 phillips head screws at the corners.
You will need to remove some of the plugs going to the light switches,
etc. to get at these.  Next, remove the speedometer cable, and the gauge
cluster should come free enough to get underneath it where the light to
the clock is located.  You will need to rotate this light socket counter
clock and remove and replace.

Isn't this fun?

&gt;     Hi All,
&gt;     
&gt;     My digital clock between the speedometer and odometer is no longer 
&gt;     backlit when I have my headlights on. Does anyone has any experience 
&gt;     fixing this?
&gt;     
&gt;     In addition, the station preset lights on my VW Design am/fm/cassette 
&gt;     radio also no longer light up when the headlights are on. I originally 
&gt;     thought the LED's were bad, but another VW Design radio did the same 
&gt;     thing.
&gt;     
&gt;     Are these two situations related? Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;     
&gt;     TIA,
&gt;
