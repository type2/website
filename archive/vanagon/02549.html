Subject: Heating Drinking Water

Martha,

Here's an idea of how to heat your drinking water so you can shower in it.

Buy the spare part for the refrigerator that heats the back off 12 volt
current. Get one or more of these little 12 volt heating elements. They
should be available from a source that sells parts for the Dometic line of
refrigerators. I know of such a source in Illinois and they sent me a whole
microfiche just for the Dometic 182B line of refrigerators (the ones for
Vanagon.)

Then, suspend these little elements into the drinking water tank along with a
radio shack thermometer probe. Flick the 12 volt current on when you want to
heat the water and then flick the 12 volt current off when the radio shack
thermometer reads 100 degrees (or whatever is a comfortable shower temp; I
don't know what that would be.)
