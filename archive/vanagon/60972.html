Subject: Re: ?G2 on G60 Corrado?

Carl H. asks:

&gt;Does anyone have an opinion, on the '91 Corrado. By the way, if I buy, it


To which I say (ask):  uhm, excuse me, but if the SO thinks it's
tough on the back with a Scirocco and 14 m/o Tersa, how will it
get better with a Corrado and 14 m/o Tersa?...  'Sorry, been there,
done that,...next!

What you really want to do is go hunt around for a first year,
Flash Red (or is it Tornado Rot?) Jetta3 GLX.  I think they
came out in the '95 model year.  Granted, it's (probably) not
priced as right as a '90 or '91 G60 Corrado, but it will have
four, count'em, 4, doors AND it'll have that VR6 motor...

Hey, want to buy our '91 GLI?  Four doors, VERY RED, very fast,
already has a couple of child seats in it...   ;)

Have fun shopping for your SO's new ride!
