A GEX will cost you around 1200-1500 (depending on core return). Add to that
all the other parts
you will likely replace (clutch, vacuum hoses, plugs, muffler gaskets etc)
and your bill can quickly mount. We did the GEX route because of the lack
of time and space (no place to work in our Palo Alto apartment). If  you
have both then a diy job may be preferred. The dollar savings imho will
not be that great if you end up putting in new cylinders, pistons and
possibly heads, most certainly exhaust valves, as well as bearings and shafts.
Ask yourself: is the
broken seat an indicator of something else, possibly a  general problem?
If so, then factor that into the overall cost. A
&quot;muldoon&quot; rebuild otoh can be very cheap. Replacing only those parts that
must be replaced can give you an engine life of 20,000 miles. I have a
1600 with new rings and exhaust valves which is still going strong after 5
years...

OTOH the advantage of the GEX is twofold: warranty and delivery. They will
deliver to your local flaps the next day (we got ours from Menlo auto parts,
Kohlweiss
will also deliver). The warranty is good. We ended up having to replace the
first GEX because the
crankshaft endplay was .0002 out (the engine had not been run). GEX replaced
it no questions asked. The warranty is for 12000 miles, but I have heard
that GEX will cover some or all of the R and R costs if you can prove 
mechanical failure not due to negligence at any point in the engine's life.

If you have kids rebuilding an engine is probably a great teaching tool
(especially in patience)....
