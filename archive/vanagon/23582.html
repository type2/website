I, being the list God have decided to split the vanagon list into two 
groups.
One will be a low priorty list -- I'll distribute evey once in a while.
The other will continue to have this lovely lively discussion.
The split will be into these two groups.

1. High priority list:
    Those people who sent $15 to rpalmer so I could have a nice T-Shirt

2. Low priority list
    Those people who DIDN'T send rpalmer $15.

Ohhh Yeaaa!
