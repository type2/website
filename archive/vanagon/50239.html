 I have recently had a somewhat disturbing experience with my
 oil pressure light. After driving on the highway for about two
 hours att constant speed i slowed down and coasted with the
 clutch in for a bit before shifting into third to continue
 slowing down.  while i was coasting with the clutch in the oil
 light and buzzer came on and stayed on until i down shifted
 into third and brought the rpm's back up.  This happened two
 more times on the trip, but not everytime a situation as above
 occured.  
 	I am perhaps overly concerned since this was my first
 highway trip on my rebuilt engine. I had already put about 300
 miles on the engine without incident.  I recall seeing some
 posts about this type of occurrence in the past, but can't
 recall solutions (and i don't have extensive time to search the
 archives) Any ideas/past experiences/recollections of previous
 posts would be greatly appreciated.  Is it possible that i just
 need a new sensor or ???.
 many thanks in advance

I have recently had this problem with a factry rebuilt engine I installed.
 It seems the tolerance of some of the 1.8 bar switches,(25 psi) is a bit too
high.  This is the switch near the oil pump.  it would only turn on the
buzzer after an extended highway run.  I repalced this swith with a 1.6 bar
switch and the problem went away.  I did check the oil pressure with a
mechanical gauge.  It did get up to 50 psi at 4000rpm, 35 PSI at 3000.  This
was typical of what I see on a hot engine.  The slightly lower pressure
switch took care of thre problem.
