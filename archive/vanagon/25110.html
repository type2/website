Subject: CRUISE BLUES (BAD) NEWS

Help!

I broke down and shelled out $275 for a &quot;proffessionally&quot; installed
&quot;electric&quot; cruise for my 87 Westie.  It's a SCS/FRIGETTE which I had
installed on my Trooper.  Works great on the Trooper.  Cut out 5 times in
40-miles on the Vanagon.  I called FRIGETTE - they said VW voltage problems
and don't sell cruise for Vanagons!  Someone (on this list)  mentioned ZEMCO.
 Who, what and where are they?  Any help is appreciated.....I'm (obviously)
going back to the installer but I'd like to give them an option since I do
love cruise.

Thanks,
Ajax
87 Vanagon GL  Westy Camper.
