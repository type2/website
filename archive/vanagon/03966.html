Hi!

	Well you sure get to work quickly!  I just subscribed a
few days ago!  It took me a while to figure out how to subscribe!
I imagine many others have the same problems as I did (mostly a
because I have never subscribed to a listserver).

My Van:   1968 converted kombi bus
		Right Hand Drive camperized in Devon England
		Chassis # 238117133 block # HO645601
		Bought in early 80's in Calgary by my Father
		Original owner brought is over to Canada.

My Problem:

		The clutch and accelerator cables are longer than
the ones for left hand drive!  I had problem this year when my
cable broke twice!  Once here and once on a toll bridge in the SF
Bay area late on a Sunday Night!  They had to lash two Cables
together! I am looking for someone who can give me information on
the exact length of the correct cable and anywhere I could get a
cable before it breaks again!  I don't expect any in N.A., but
know that UK and Australia, New Zealand and maybe other places
would have RHD vehicles.

PS do you share the information you have gathered?  Are there any
other RHD owners in N.America?

Thanks 

Darren
