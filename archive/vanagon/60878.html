Subject: 79 Water-cooled Bus?

I just got a J.Crew clothing catalogue in the mail (the Vacation 1997 issue).
And on page 117 there is a light blue (actually I guess it's gray primer)
late 70s Westfalia bus with a fairly large black radiator grill on the front.
In the center of the grill is the VW symbol. It's hard to tell from the photo
but it looks like it is more than a cosmetic alteration. If anyone has this
catalogue or knows of the actual bus and knows the story of it, I'd love to
know. I'm guessing the photo was taken in California. Or if the catalogue is
kicking around your house check it out this oddity. I realize it's not a
Vanagon but it piqued my interest and I thought it might interest others.
