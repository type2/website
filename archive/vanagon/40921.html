Subject: '66 progress, question about full-flow oil filter



Hi all,

Yesterday, I got all my tin-ware and heat exchangers back from the
powder coating place.  The heat-exchangers got a special silicon coating
that's supposed to be much better at high temps than the normal
powder coating I got for the tin (&quot;normal&quot; is only good to about 450F).
It really looks good!  Last night I did some pre-assembly of the tin
on the engine and realized that my &quot;breast-plate&quot; is missing the little
boxes that cover the place where the intake manifold pre-heat pipes
join the muffler.  :-(  Fortunately, at noon I visited one of the local
VW junkyards and aquired a &quot;not broke just slightly bent&quot; breast-plate
that I will straighten and get painted.  (I also got the two little tin
pieces that attach to the breast-plate to cover the front of the pre-heat
pipe joints that contain asbestos &quot;seals&quot;.)

Also got a bunch of stuff from RMMW including most of my thermostat
parts, degreed pully, some seals, and a Bentley 1963-1967 Transporter
manual, a nice book!

At the junk yard I also managed to scrounge a big VW front emblem (white),
a plastic winshild-squirter tank with working rubber cap-pump, a
12-volt alternator/generator pully, and a knob for my Sapphire-I radio.

I had my doghouse-width cooling fan cleaned by media blasting and will
take it in to be balanced before I mount it.

I took my new alternator stand and my old generator stand /w oil filler
down to the VW dealer on the way to work to see if they had VW tool
#170 which is used to remove the oil filler from the generator stand.
They didn't have the tool but told me how to do it myself with crossed
screwdrivers.  We'll see if that works.  I'll probably have to make
my own gasket for this as nobody seems to have one.

My question.  I have my long-block all set up for a full-flow oil filter
with a fitting on the oil-pump and one on the oil-galley.  I also have
an oil filter brackett the the oil filter screws onto and which has two
fittings on the top for oil-in and oil-out.  Where is a good place to mount
this?  I hope to mount it without cutting a hole in my tin-ware.

More later....


Cheers,

 -Dyer
