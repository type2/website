Subject: Reply to: Re: Signs of Waterpump Death

 &gt;&gt;  I have had a hose fail in this area at the top of the head. It is a
 strange looking hose that is part of the self bleeding system. It starts
 out at 3/4&quot; id,  makes a 90 degree turn, and reduces to about 1/4&quot; ID. I
 was unable to tell this hose was leaking until I bent it just right. &lt;&lt;

 It took a lot of staring but I finally caught the pump dripping from the weep
hole.  I did take your advice to heart and torqued those two weird hoses
around, but they look sound.  Unless they're a hundred bucks apiece, I'll buy
new hoses when I do the swap.  Thanks again!
