Subject: Re: Trade Westy tent for gas heater???

Dan:

&gt;how has the reliability been?
When I bought the van 2 years ago, I negotiated the price down by 
_at_$500 becuz the heater wasn't werking.  The metering (fuel) pump was 
not functioning.  VWoA wanted close to $700 for a new one (yeh 
right).  Anyways, a guy on this list (out of Alaska) suggested 
freeing up the pump by inserting a small blunt instrument in the 
appature to free up the diaphram.  This werked.  I've had the pump 
stop a couple of times shortly after this remedy, but I tapped it 
with a wrench to get it going again.  I suspect debris from fuel/tank 
caused the initial problems.  No problems since though.  There are 
some maintainence  to follow and not to run too lean... 

&gt; does frozen slush on the underside of the van cause problems?

Last winter was a banner year for us in terms of snow, and hence 
slush.  The unit itself is exposed, but get very warm.  No slush 
accumulation here.  You may if you do install one, mount the pump in 
a protected area (mine's not).

&gt; did you do the installation and was it tough (i think i know the answer to this!)? 

No I did not.  You will need to do some welding.  For me that would 
be the hardest hurdle to overcome as I do not have the equipment.  
The are a fair number of components that are wired into the system 
for safety and communication.  I would classify this upgrade as 
moderately difficult.  Depends on your skill level.  If you do not have 
to rush this, you could do a bang-up job.
 
&gt; noise level is quite high aren't they? 

I guess, but then again I drive a split.  It sure is nice to hear the 
heater roar....

&gt; and lastly, do you feel safe with it?

At first I had some reservations.  I mean it's a gas heater I'm 
running mid-ships.  But I've used it heavily.  I don't like to keep 
it running when I'm sleeping (that is when camping, I try not to 
sleep when driving :^&amp; .  But other than that I feel pretty safe 
using it.  The concensus of this list seems to be Eberspachers are safe.
