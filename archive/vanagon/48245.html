Subject: What would be fair?

     There is a 1989 Westfalia GL for sale near my home for $11,500.  It 
     has 115K, manual windows, 4sp, full equipment, new tires.  The guy 
     that is selling it says that he used it to travel from bike races and 
     that he bought it with 88K.  The top heads (?) have been redone.  It 
     has one noticable scratch on the sliding door and is missing the VW 
     emblem off of the rear hatch.  I sort of have new car fever and was 
     thinking of offering him $9500 cash.  What do you think would be fair?
