Subject: Re: timing belt?

Greetings again,
 I have a question about this. I heard that the suburu [legacy] engine
was either designed by or based on the vanagon flat 4 type engine.
The subaru is however 'blessed' with 2! timing belts- so what's up?
btw- the suburu is not a 'zero clearence' engine so a broken belt is
just a broken belt.
  i'm still having an all the time 1200-1800 engine surge oscillation
in my 85 vanagon-help!
bill
