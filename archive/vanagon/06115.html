Subject: RE: pre-tour warm up



I think Martha's and Davids idea is great; it can be a lot of fun (except 
for all the VW talk.....).

However, I agree with others that PArks within the Sierra Nevada might 
NOT be the best choice in the middle of the winter (road conditions, 
night temperatures etc.); why not pick an area/park either at the coast, 
or more in the South?

Keep me informed, I would like to try and make it....
