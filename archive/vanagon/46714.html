Subject: canadian road trip

Warning: the only VW content here is that I'm planning on driving it!

Anyway, I've been thinking about a road trip, I have about 12 days, and I'm
thinking about either:
1) going up to Vancouver Island, driving out to Tofino, then back to the
east shore and working my way north to Pt Hardy. Maybe then swing back to
Comox, over to Powell River via ferry, then down the coast.
2) out to Eastern Washington, up 97 through Omak, crossing into Canada then
up into Penticton, Kelowna, then maybe heading east to Revelstoke and
perhaps even seeing how close I can make it to Lake Louise ( while still
leaving enough time to get back, I figure 3 long days Lake Louise to
Vancouver.)

So, never having been in either of these areas before I'm wondering what to
expect in the way of towns, road conditions/congestion, camping
availability,
overall pleasantness at this time of year. Any detours, suggestions,
warnings, etc would be most welcome.

Oh, just out of curiousity - anyone know what kind of condition the road
between Bella Coola and Williams Lake is? From the maps I've seen, it
appears to to 150+ miles of gravel, I'm just wondering if that's true or my
maps are out of date?

thanks in advance
