Subject: Any N. VA people coming to the NC VW campout?

hey now,

if any north Va folks are coming down to NC for the campout, i need to ask a
huge favor of you. i've got a connection for a CO2 tank and kegging
parephenalia in alexandria but i can't get up there. if anyone is coming this
way and wouldn't mind picking this up for me and then returning it, i'd sure
appreciate it and will pay you with a nice armenian stout that's prolly about
9.5-10.0% alcohol content. you won't be sorry! hehehehe muahahahahah

thanks,

jonathan '74 (retrowestie Rumm Rumm RuMbA)
