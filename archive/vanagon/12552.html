&gt;&gt;Engines do have a service life, after which they must be rebuilt/replaced.

&gt;&gt;Just because the original engine blew doesn't necessarily mean that it is 
&gt;&gt;an inherently bad engine. 
&gt; 
&gt;Cause--???. Had 100,000 miles on it. Many places that I  called to ask
&gt;about prices said they don't carry that one cause of problems with the
&gt;warranty, overheating etc. It was the first year that they did the water
&gt;cooled and they changed the design pretty quickly.

I reposted your reply to me, so that my comments get the benefit of peer review.

100,000 miles?  If a later engine is a direct replacement, then, sure, why
not upgrade?  

I suspect that even upgrading to a 1984, 85, 86, etc. engine may not be
exactly plug and play.  You need to find someone in your area that actually
knows what to do from experience - a blow by blow description of what to do
by email has the problem of not being able to anticipate special problems
if they occur.
