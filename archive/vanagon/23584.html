Subject: The $20.00 Paint Job



/ff

The thing that's always bothered me about my paint jobs is the brush marks.
 By the time you get them all rubbed out you're just about down to bare metal
again.  And don't talke to me about spray-paint, I tried it.  Don't work.
 The nozzle clogs up about once a minute and your arm gets tired of pumping
before you got the job half done.  Besides, nowadays you can't hardy find a
good fly-sprayer, everybody using those spritz cans.  Oh, I tried them too
but don't see the sense of it.  Soon as you get the top off the stuff gets
all over you.

Sponges.  That's the ticket.  I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.

The Home Dee Pot store had a sale on sponges, big square-edged things; I
guess they can grow them any shape they want nowadays.  Buck each.  I bought
two.  Stopped by the Paint Dee Partment and bought a gallon of their best
stuff, the can with that little Dutch boy on it.  Eighteen whole dollars for
just the one can.  But it's guaranteed for twenty years or you can bring it
back, get another can.  Cleans up with water, too.

Took it home and painted the pick-up, the wife's Ford and my old beetle-bus,
all before supper.  Went back out while the wife was doing the dishes and
used a razor blade to clean up around the windows.

Fine job, mighty fine.  Can't hardly even see the rust anymore, 'cept for the
holes.  Soon as I fix the ladder I'll do the high parts.  Just wait 'til the
wife sees her little Ford, big smile for sure.
