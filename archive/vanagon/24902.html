(73' westy still for sale ;)

&gt;Great way to make 'em look spiffy in a jiffy:
&gt;Brillo, SOS pad or such. Pinch it between your fingers, so as not to touch
&gt;the paint. OPen your windows, and scrub in direction of metal grain. Do
&gt;this until the pad slides smoothly. You won't beee-leeeve the difference.
&gt;(If you're really into it, top off with silver/aluminum polish.) About 10
&gt;minutes, and they'll look like new.
