&gt;
&gt;Bolts are not identified by the size of the wrench.  They are identified by
&gt;the diameter of the shank.  The VW uses 8mm x45mm x1.25.  Grade 10.9 or 12.9
&gt;prefered.  Some Audis and Porsches use 10mm bolts.  

This is probably true.  What do I know about shank diameters? (Well I know
more now Dennis! ;) )  But after he had just passed me a 6mm hex socket, why
would he want to  give me *star* head bolts -  termed 8mm??  Just to confuse
my sorry a**??  Or am I still missing a crucial point?  Anyway...
