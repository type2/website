Subject: RE: Hit from behind by a car going 90mph



&gt; I have a
&gt;whole new perspective on drunk drivers.  Even if the guy had pulled over,
&gt;I'm not sure I would want to confront a drunk with a .45.


In this case, I'd say that depends on which of you is holding the .45.

Glad you're OK, tho-- bus rear ends are pretty solid, as I've had occasion
to find out (mild tap from another hit-and-run, either a stolen plate or
I wrote it down wrong). I would not mind seeing individuals like that,
breaking rocks in the hot sun for a long time. My lady friend was killed
by a DUI, five-time offender, near Breckenridge many years ago.

I'm selling my '71, but it's not a westy-- an 8-seat metal-roof non-walk-
through. Tired '70 engine whose story has been chronicled here (details
if you like), runs well but overheats on long trips. New tires (good ones),
new master cyl, nice interior, dent in front, slightly dinged rear bumper,
rust under the windshield. leaks lots of oil. Basically, a rebuilt engine
would make it a whole different car.

Don't know if this would suit you-- it's not a westy, pop-top, or even a
camper, tho I suppose it could be camperized with your interior. No rust,
except under the windshield.

Anyone have any idea what I should ask for this creature?

Thanks in advance...
