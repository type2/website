Subject: RE: towing boat


&gt;This is becoming surreal ;)

I was wondering when someone would notice.

&gt;And all the paleo-poster wanted to know was whether he could dunk the
&gt;engine in the water without expecting damage, to which the answer is &quot;no.&quot;
&gt;;)

Yup. And so someone else (meso-poster?) suggested putting a second hitch
on the front of the bus, to be used in &quot;fronting&quot; the boat into the water.
Since this has probably been rarely tried, I tried to compare it to a FWD
car backing a boat in-- engine high and dry, far from the wa-wa, sitting
over the driving wheels, while the sheet-metal end of the car gets a little
dunked. Probably been done a fair amount since the '80s.

Lo and behold, that's just like... A VW BUS WITH A HITCH IN FRONT!

Apples to apples. Washingtons to Granny Smiths, anyway...   :^)

So... back to the next-to-original question: Anyone ever back a boat
down a ramp with a FWD car, and had the driving wheels slip and lose
traction????

Maybe from this, we can guess whether our favorite VW bus &quot;fronting&quot;
a boat down a ramp, would have the same problem.


How did front-engine, rear-drive cars get into this anyway? No relation!
