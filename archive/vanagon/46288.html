&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; On another unrelated, but VW note:  I received my rear window seal that I
&gt;&gt; ordered from RMMW when it was on sale for $9.95.  That was a great price,
&gt;&gt; but did I mention that I ordered it in February?  That just broke my
&gt;&gt; personal record for longest backorder!  Oh well, at least it finally
&gt;&gt;arrived. &gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;Very interesting, considering we just shipped over 100 of these seals to RMMW
&gt;&gt;about 3 weeks ago, because RMMW's normal supplier (Brazil) has had them on
&gt;&gt;B/O for them since last November.  Guess RMMW got tired of waiting too. (And
&gt;&gt;they paid a little more than $9.95 too!).  We're now RMMW's main supplier for
&gt;&gt;these and a few other Window Seals they've inquired about from us.  It's a
&gt;&gt;lot softer than WCM's IMHO and easier to install as well.  I've been making
&gt;&gt;these since 1976 (The Old Volks Home).  Made in USA - the only way to go :)


We just recieved the 3 rear window seals we'd had back ordered on us too.
Funny tho as they tried to bill us 29.95 each for them. We sent em back!

BTW; I know Jim monitors V_at_L daily, anyone know if we have a RMMW Lurker in
our midst? Their customer service eMail address may as well be disconnected
as I never seem to get any replies from them...
