&gt; Life for seals can go down, way down for just a 20 degree rise in max temp.
&gt; It can be the max temp, not the running temp that determines seal life.
&gt;
 Hi all:  This is part of the reason I decided to try ceramic coating
the seal surface of the head, the other reason is to  try to stop
corrosion.


&gt; Would heads crack less if they were not left to hot soak after each
&gt; shut-down?
&gt; 
  Or would the faster cooling make the heads crack worse. I do like the
idea of circulating the coolant after a hot run but only so the engine
does not heat up more than operating temp just after shut down.  I
wonder how much hotter the head gets after shut down.
