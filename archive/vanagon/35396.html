Subject: Gen &amp; Regulator Woes


All,


We have been having problems with the generator on my
1200 engine, since we rebuilt the engine. My Dad seems
to think that it is wired up to the regulator wrong.
All the manuals we have looked at say, replace the same
way as taken off, as our engine did not have a regulator
on it when we got it, and this is our first engine rebuild
this is not a lot of help. What i need to know is, there is
three wires coming from the generator and two terminals on
the regulator, which terminal on the regulator takes two
wires.
Thanks in advance for any advice.

Cheers,
