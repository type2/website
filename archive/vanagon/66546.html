Subject:      alloy wheels

Hi there,

I have the following question:

For my '81 diesel Vanagon (pictures on my web site
http://home.pi_dot_net/~jwbrier/jwbus.htm) I managed to buy a set (5) of
original VW allow wheels. These wheels were sold by VW on '85 thru 89
vanagons (Caravelles).

As it turns out I cannot use the nuts and bolts that hold the old steel
rims. The shape of the hole where it mates with the head of the nut is
conical rather than round.

I checked with the VW dealer (that's not VW was their first reaction,
although they genuinely are). They found the wheels on the fiche and quoted
the price of the nuts (5$ each) and the bolts ($9 each). That comes to $140
in total! They were very apprehensive about the whole thing.

Two questions:

1. Anyone knows anything about this? Suggestions?
2. The wheels are somewhat thicker (+ 1cm / 0.5&quot;) than the steel ones. Are
the studs for the rear wheels long enough to mount the alloy wheels? Or
should they be replaced with longer ones?
