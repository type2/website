Subject: Never seen one of those!

HI all,

This morning I spotted what looked like a 76 VW bus (saw it from a
distance)that was a converted camper (looked like a vertical pop top).  What
was unusual was that it was about 5 feet longer than a normal bus.  Looks
like this fellow welded the middle section of another bus to the front and
back ends of his bus.  His plate was of U.S. origin, I couldn't make out
what state.  I've never seen one of these in Canada or anywhere else!
