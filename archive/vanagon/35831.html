&gt; Hey all,
&gt; So, all you folks out there who have buses with Type IV engines, what
&gt; do you use to get the oil filter off??  It's a little cramped under there so it
&gt; doesn't look like I'd be able to get one of those standard oil filter
&gt; wrenches up there.  I have a wrench from Toyota that attaches to a
&gt; ratchet and slips over the bottom of the filter, but it's too small in diameter
&gt; to fit the VW filter.  Is there a special filter removal tool that you have to
&gt; buy or can it be done another way?
