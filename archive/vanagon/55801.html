 &gt; on me.....isn't it interesting that there are at least three EV owners on 
 &gt; the list who have TWICE, under no duress, etc., purchased two of VW's 
 &gt; marketing masterpieces....the VW Thing and the EuroVan.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Let's see....I'm guilty....so are Pete Sellers and the Killians....are there 
 &gt; others? What other bizzare behavior do we have in common? Hmmmmmm.......
