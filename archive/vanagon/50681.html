Subject: 89' Vanagon GL sputtering, stalling

Hi Y'all...  Any good shadetree or otherwise pro mechanics to help me?   My
89 Westy has one serious problem.that needs fixin'.   Presently at 80,000
miles.   Engine starts great,  idles okay, though sometimes, it surges
slightly when cold..  I take off, and as engine warms up, and needle on temp
gauge comes to middle showing warm,  I start having difficulties.   At each
stop...  for next few miles,  engine sputters and almost stalls as I tenderly
hit gas , or try to accelerate... The oil light on the dash lights
intermittanly, as I almost stall out.  I throw gear (auto trans) into
neutral, and gingerly apply gas, and somehow bring back RPM's, until I feel
confident to throw into drive.  Sometimes,  the engine does okay from
there... sometimes,  continues to stall.  When it stalls completely, I'm able
to restart right away,  however the problem  stays... After driving on open
road, or some further miles,  problem seems to go away. 

I've got a new ECU, I've changed coolant temp sensor, new fuel filter, and
Idle stabilizer valve is working okay.... where's my problem?  I've gone
through the archives, and noted some similiar problems with ignition coil as
possible cause.  One tech bulletin even suggested it could be the oil pump
causing valves to hang open.   HELP!    Any ideas, or similiar experience and
remedies would be helpful!
