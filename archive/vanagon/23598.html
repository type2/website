Subject: What would you do?

Symptoms:

Compression check reveals #1=111, #2=109, #3=112, #4=75 dry/73 wet. 8(
Oil use/spew is running somewhere around 1 quart per hour of 
operation...looks like it might be the oil cooler leaking per Bentley's 
suggestion to look at the amount on the left side of the engine.

Question:

Would you drive the hour to the Eureka VW show? I guess I could ask my 
friend to drive his car, but we've really got pumped up for this trip in 
the bus 8| 

Anyway, I know what I SHOULD do; I just don't know what I WILL do.

Thanks!
