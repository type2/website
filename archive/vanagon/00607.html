&gt; Sounds like Monty's Chev-Jeep-Olds-GMC-Buick-VW... in Victorville Ca.
&gt; &quot;Syncro? made by VW? &quot;They don't make four wheel drives.&quot; &quot;Vanagons 
&gt; don't have CV joints on the front axel.&quot; We've never seen one, but 
&gt; bring it in and we'll work on it&quot;.  You can see where this went...
&gt; CLICK. I have never called or gone there ever again. Luckly this was 
&gt; the first time I had called them... I bet they have one guy there 
&gt; that has a German last name. If he's German, he will work on the VW's 
&gt; that come in...

Hey Paul,

What are doin' livin' out there in BF Egypt (Victorville) for?  ;)
No wonder you have a Syncro.  Are there any roads there? ;)

I just looked on the California map when I didn't have any idea where
Victorville was or even heard of it.  Well, now I know.

Cheers!
