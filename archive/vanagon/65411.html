Chris,

I live in Stockton and have lower cost State Farm policy on my 1983.5
Adventurewagen. All it took was for my agent to inspect it and submit
photo's of the interior and exterior. In California the Adventurewagen's
are classified as housecars the same as regular class A, B, and C's. I pay
$541.74 a year but that includes higher coverages as well as comp and
collision. When I switched from 3-A to State Farm in 1990 I saved over $400
a year.

I'm not sure whether the inclusion of the holding tank or Porta-Potti
toilet is what's needed to earn the classification. California owners of
Westy's could verify whether their campers also have the same DMV
classification.
