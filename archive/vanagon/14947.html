I have a air conditioning unit that mounts on the interior roof of a '78 bus,
unfortunately i don't have the motor anymore.  Also, for sale are two bench
seats and some seat belts (non-retractable).  If interested get in touch with
me soon, as i will be closing my computer account within the next few weeks.

Thanks,
Angela
