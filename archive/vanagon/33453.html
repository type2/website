        Dan:
        
        New area code for the Suburban Company in Dayton, Tn.  You will 
        have better luck with 423-775-2131.  The official changeover will 
        take place sometime soon; after that (23 Feb I think) 615 will no 
        longer automatically roll over to 423.  I know of at least two 
        local companies haveing fax woes due to the changeover.
        
        Don't know if there is a VW content but I soemtimes drive da luv 
        bus to the courthouse in Dayton, site of the Monkey Trial in the 
        1920's.  IAE, use the 423 number.
        
        Skip
        Chattanooga, Tn
