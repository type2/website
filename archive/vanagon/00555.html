&gt; Speaking of electrical power, I've tried several ideas. I have one
&gt; success and have been apparently SCREWED once. I thought I'd share.
...
&gt; To compensate for the extra use of power, I purchased a 1200 volt invereter
&gt; made by Tripp Light of Chicago. I called myself doing some homework and
&gt; determined that nothing I had would take more than 1000 volts and was
&gt; well under the amperage of the inverter. To my surprise, the inverter
&gt; would not supply enough power for the microwave (nothing else was on-line) and
&gt; barely heated a single-burner hot plate. Upon trying to get help from the
&gt; RV dealer (purchasing source in Northern Virginia) I have had a nightmare.

I sympathize with you.  I can only add a couple of things.  First of all,
I considered buying a Tripp-Lite inverter a long time ago (like 15 years)
from Radio Shack.  Before I got around to buying it, they were discontinued.
When I asked why, the folks at Radio Shack said that they had tons of
trouble with them, and that most of them ended up being returned.  After
hearing that, I decided to look for another brand.  I ended up buying one
from J. C. Whitney, which has served me better than expected for several
years now.  I would have to go home and look at it to determine the brand.
It is only 50 watts (I just use it for my razor, and a flashlight battery
charger in emergencies).  I have been wanting to upgrade so I could run a
microwave, but would never consider a Tripp-Lite, especially after what I
have heard from you.
	Having said that, there are a couple of things that might help.
First of all, I assume that you bought a 1200 *watt* inverter (boy are
those expensive!).  If it puts out 1200 watts that means it is requiring
more than 100 *amps* from your battery at full load, and probably at least
60 amps running the microwave (including conversion-related losses). I
would first check that you are using wire large enough to support a 100 amp
load (I would guess at least 8 gauge, probably 6) to hook it up. 
	Second, make sure that your battery is capable of producing that
kind of current at 12 volts.  If the battery is small or not too new it
might only be holding 8 or 10 volts under that 60 amp load.  That would
almost surely cause the microwave's performance to suffer.
	The thing you want to do is TEST THE VOLTAGE AT THE INVERTER
while the microwave is running, and if possible, hook up an ammeter so
you can see if you are really sucking 60 amps out of your battery.  Make
*sure* that you are getting 12 VOLTS UNDER LOAD at the inverter.  My
guess is that you aren't.  Sorry about the caps, but I don't want that
part to be taken lightly.  If you are running the microwave and measuring
12 volts at the inverter then I would say the inverter has a problem.  If
you are running less than 12 volts under load then you have a problem with
your battery or wiring.  If you have an ammeter connected, you should see
about 60 amps being used while the microwave is running.

&gt; Initially, the dealer refused to cooperate or assist at all. I contacted
&gt; Tripp Light in Chicago and they flat refused to refund my money.  They offered
&gt; to inspect or repair the unit, if I shipped it to them (at my expense). Well
&gt; I've shipped it three times and upon each return it has not worked.
&gt; Tripp Light's alibis are getting weaker and weaker but they keep insisting
&gt; that some thing is wrong on my end but they could get the dealer to assist.

Doesn't suprise me, I bet you are not the first to try to get them to
fess up to the inadequacies of their products.

Please let us know how it turns out!

p.s.  I hope you know that an average battery will only run that inverter/
microwave combo for a half hour to an hour before needing a full recharge...
1200 watts is kind of overkill for a VW Van, IMHO.
