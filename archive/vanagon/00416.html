&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 	I've been talking to joel and would like to open up to any other

&gt; 	the stock 55amp alt. with a 70amp'er (minor mods); the difference is 
&gt; 	phenominal!!! You can never have too much electrical reserve!

&gt; 	slave alternators :) I am wondering about ammeters; Anyone install 
&gt; 	an ammeter in a bus before? Where did you find a suitable unit. 
&gt; 	Also, Anybody hook up a 2nd battery. (I have a deepcycle
&gt; 	die-hard marine just waiting to be added.) I'm curious about your 
&gt; 	suggestions for isolation. I'm willing to try anything logical.

&gt; 	This will be the great experimental bus of the decade! I have the 
&gt; 	summer, no job, and no life :)

I am looking for similar information for my '91 Camper.  I would appreciate the
discussion continuing on this list.

Thanks,

Steven
