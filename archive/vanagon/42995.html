Subject: moreandmore questions of my 75 westy..


first and formost: how do i change out the ignition switch? just the 
electrical end..'cause PO burned it up, and i dont wanna have to run 
little switches..

oh, i got the carb installed..after 4-6 hrs getting the manifold togethor 
on the car, w/ all boots connected to..&lt;mostyly due to already sore hands...&gt;

still cannot get engine compartment oor to stay closed...

and, while removing the old fule line system, i noticed that off the main 
line there was a smaller &lt;around 1/8&quot; I.D.&gt; line sprouting off and going 
to yet another fuel pump. this line then headed for the big contraption 
that the heater boxes seem to should be conected to. all kinds of lovel 
wires all round too..

completely striped the interior, bed, fridge sink..all of it..had to ge 
rid of the ants in the carpet..of course, the ones in the headliner..what 
bugbomb is recommended for us rehabiliatedyardbus owners?

anyway, the floor is not TO bad..just a little rough around the edges, as 
in, all the rust is there. should i just cut away the rust and 'glass it 
in, or would it be best to pay someone to weld something in?

of course, i now have to figure out which of those hundreds of leftover 
wires is the one that hooks t the oil pressure sender..

there is more, but i cant quite remeber it now...thanks!
