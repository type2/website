&gt; &gt;Pull out dipstick.  Oil to TOP of dipstick.  Odd.  Well, let's clean
&gt; &gt;it off, and check for real.  Back in and out.  OIL AT TOP OF DIPSTICK!
&gt; 
&gt; Any chance your fuel pump has developed a hole in its diaphragm,
&gt; and is draining gasoline into the engine oil? I've seen this happen
&gt; on both VWs and Fords.

I probably wasn't clear in my message.  What I meant to say was that 
the engine was over 3/4 full (dip-stick read over 1/2) of oil when 
Rich took the bus in to get the tune up.

On top of that the mechanic ADDED 2 quarts!  I guess the dip-stick 
mechanic couldn't figure out how the dip-stick worked! (Pun intended!)
