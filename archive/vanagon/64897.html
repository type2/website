I had an 80 rabbit that did the same thing.  There is a hose that you can get from
the  dealer that routes the oil back to the pump.  A simple &quot;Y&quot; type hose.  Sorry
I cant give you anymore information that that.  My brother-in-law burned the poor
thing up by running it approximately 20 miles with insufficient fluid in the
radiator.
Good Luck.

&gt; Vanagon engine in there, you may have a baffle problem or need to rig some
&gt; type of oil separator/return to get the liquid back to the crankcase.  Also,
&gt; make sure you are not over filling the engine.  Try running it a quart low and
&gt; see if the situation improves.  As far as I'm concerned, a VW engine should
&gt; never be filled to the top mark anyway.  Hope this helps,

&gt;
&gt;         Several years ago, I rebuilt my 1.6 litre TD motor, putting
&gt; in 20 thou oversize pistons, and fitting them with Hastings oil
&gt; and compression rings - all chromium.
&gt;
&gt;         I ran conventional oil for several thousand miles, then
&gt; switched to Delvac 1, the Mobil synthetic designed for diesels.
&gt; I slowly began using oil, at first a litre every thousand miles.
&gt; Then  several months ago, down to two hundred miles to the
&gt; litre.  At that point, I went back to Delvac conventional oil, as I
&gt; could not afford the $ to keep feeding the motor, synthetic oil.
&gt;
&gt;         On my holidays just completed, the consumption increased
&gt; to about 50 miles to the litre. Needless to say,  when checking
&gt; the oil, it has the cleanest oil for a diesel!  The exhaust is sky
&gt; blue and never black.
&gt;
&gt;         Back home, I just completed a compression test, thinking
&gt; the rings must be worn or broken for some reason. The
&gt; compression values average 480 psi throughout, which is
&gt; what they were three years ago.
&gt;
&gt;         My question is then, can the compression rings be good,
&gt; but the oil scraper ring fouled or broken?  Alternatively, can
&gt; the valve stem seals be so leaky as to allow oil to leak into the
&gt; combusion chamber?
&gt;
&gt;         The motor has never ran low on coolant, or over heated. I
&gt; changed the turbocharger, thinking the impeller was drawing
&gt; oil from the oil lubricated bearings and driving it into the motor.
&gt; Oil consumption was unchanged.
&gt;
&gt;         I'm baffled, annoyed and disgusted.  What is the percentage
&gt; likelihood of leaky valve stem seals versus  defective oil scraper
&gt; rings? ? ?  Any other possibilities not heretofore considered? ?
&gt;
&gt;         E-mail me directly if you have a clue, as the head is coming
&gt; off today at 1100 hours.
