Subject: Hemmings Motor News Classified's

if anybody needs any of the vw ads out of the nov. 95 issue of hemmings let
me know. i just spent the $8.00 (eeep!) to get the mag.

the vw ads are a bit long to post here.

ther is a nice original 53' ambulance for sale in ca. if you have an extra
$15K burning a hole in your pocket.
