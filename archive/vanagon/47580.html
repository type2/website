Subject: Re: 88 Synchro Exhaust and Engine ?

&gt;perhaps that is silly unless someone has done it and finds it 
&gt;fantastic, I would rather find other methods (higher compression 
&gt;perhaps etc...).

Get hold of Kennedy Engineered Products, in California, (sorry, no number) 
They sell a full kit to fit the Subaru in properly, CA smog certified also. 
The benefits are, higher compression, 16 valve engine with overhead cam, and 
reportedly high reliability/lifespan.  130HP vs. 95 is pretty appealing. or 
155HP from newest Legacy Outback, or 160HP from Legacy Turbo.  The Subaru 
plus the KEP kit will cost under what a basic rebuilt longblock for the 
wasser will cost and you get a 'stock' motor with big dealer parts/repair 
network as well as an engine that is still in production, not dead 5 years 
ago.  My Syncro is not a strong as I like off road/up hills and the Subaru 
conversion will be my fix, BUT KEP could'nt answer if it works in Syncro due 
to skid plates etc.   Tim 

PS: if you want to buy my engine 100% complete, _at_131K kms, clean/dry no 
leaks of any kind, with 125PSI in all cylinders, (heads done 3 years 
ago)........
 make me an offer, then I can get that Subaru in by the fall :) I'm serious!

&gt;Can anyone please point me in the right direction (positive or 
&gt;negative) Thanks !!
