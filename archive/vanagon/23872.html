Subject: more power to old bricks

Back in the good ole days (late 60's early 70's) I put a Porsche 912
engine into my 68 bus.  All that was needed was a spacer between the
engine and transmission - about 3/8 inches thick.  The engine just bolted
in - engine mounts were right where they had to be.  Engine swap could be
done in an afternoon.  Conversion made for very enjoyable cross-country
trips - boston to berkely to boston in a weeks time kind of stuff as well
as some nice extended summer trips in south west. 

Now have a 87 Syncro.   Makes one forget how treacherous the roads really 
are after a snow storm.
