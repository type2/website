Sounds good. I get to SoCal (Anaheim) fairly often -- maybe we can arrange to 
meet somewhere.

&gt;I want $20 for it cause that's what I paid for it (from another
&gt;listmember).  I already have inquiries on it, but I'll let you know if
&gt;the buyers back out.

Sold if they back out!

Thanks

Scott
