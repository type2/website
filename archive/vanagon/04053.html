David,
I didn't really &quot;collect&quot; the data. I just told the list to give me
its statistics.  I think the statistics got reset at one point.  Maybe at 
several....It IS odd; everyone is on the list -- a lot of zeros, and 
you're one of them...hmmm.
[delay while I research this]

Oh this is rich.  Did you know that you're not even on the list?  &lt;grin&gt;
The list is open.  That means you can post without being on the list.  
You post from dcarment_at_ccs_dot_carleton_dot_ca, but you're on the list as 
dcarment_at_superior_dot_carleton_dot_ca.  So, this means you're not on the list!  
What a trip.  Unsub and resub and I'll rerun the stats and see what we get.
