Subject: more from Schwarze...


Schwarze phoned to remind people - he hopes they are coming to
Honeyman!  It would be nice if as many can show up do, since I
think it's turned out often on this GNATT tour that not very many
people have been able to make things as they had orginally planned  :(

Also, he said that we will have to decide about Yosemite when we
get there, since if the one place we were hoping for is closed,
that means we won't be able to camp there, and an alternative
spot will have to be found.  I think he plans to ask Steve
Johnson to be a go-between to help with live messaging on
this via phone.

David is presently at the KOA campground (which he says is a REALLY nice 
one, unlike many other KOAs) in Port Townsend, Washington, or right
near there.  If anyone needs to reach him, please check this
out, but I believe the phone number there is:  360.457.5916
