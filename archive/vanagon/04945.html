Subject: US License plate fetish

Hi, all

You might think that my desire for US license plates is a
bit bizarre, but hey have you ever seen UK plates - they suck.

It all started when I got my first bus and decided to &quot;CAL&quot; it.
I smoothed it off etc.. and fitted California license plates.
There's a company over here which will press out your UK
number onto a California (or any state) plate.
They made my bus really stick out in a crowd - along with my
US spec rear light (all red).

You might thick why don't you move to the US - hell I might!

Well anyway I've got a thing going with all you US'ers and
I'm gonna have a wall full of lisence plates - that'll impress
the babes -huh -huh -huh (Beavis and Butthead type laugh!)

Lee.
