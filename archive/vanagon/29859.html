All,

Here is the fascinating conclusion to the epic saga of the Goldberg Family
going to visit Mickey and returning, sanity, and Westy intact.

Enjoy,

SENT 11-30-95 FROM GOLDBERG_DAVID

When we left our intrepid travellers, they had just reached their
hotel, their Xanadu, if you will permit me to delve into their dazed
minds for just a moment.

ACT II (interior shot, hotel room, curtains closed tightly, small
amount of light coming in from around curtains)

(door opens, Ashley walks in wide awake, with Vanessa, the child,
because they both slept since 7:00pm the previous evening)

&quot;Come on wake up, we need to get to the park&quot;

(masculine voice from under the bed covers)

&quot;It is only 10:00 am, I have only gotten 7 hours sleep, in the past 2
days&quot;

(Donna, concerned for her husbands well being)

&quot;Get up, were only here for three days, lets get moving&quot;


     That was how my first day in florida started.  We all got ready
to go (rather slowly for me), and jumped in the van to head to that
mecca of smiling faces, Disney World.  I noticed that the knocking
from the CV's was getting a bit more persistent.  I had greased the
offending CV before leaving, and the knocking was only heard on sharp
left turns, not bad enough to worry about at the time. I had hoped
that it would hold off until at least we made back to Louisiana where
we were planning on spending turkey day with my wifes family,
apparently that was not going to happen.  It held out until Sunday
after breakfast when I really started knocking loudly. I limped it
back to the hotel room, and made plans to rent a car for a couple of
days, until I could get a CV and replace the bad one.  I called all of
the auto parts places open on sunday, none of them had a CV for a '79
VW Bus.  Well, there was a VW speciality place in the phone book that
would be open on Monday, they would surely have on in.  Monday came,
and they were the first place I called.  &quot;Yes we have them, I could
have it UPSed from our warehouse to you by tomorrow&quot; &quot;I need it today&quot;
&quot;Try a place called the CV Exchange&quot; &quot;Hello CV Exchange&quot; &quot;Do you have
a CV joint for a '79 VW bus?&quot;  &quot;No but I could rebuild the entire axle
for $99&quot; &quot;Great, where are you?&quot;  &quot;I am staying at the Comfort Inn at
Kissimee&quot; &quot; You aren't a shop?&quot;  &quot;No I am visiting from out of town,
and I was referred to you by another shop&quot; &quot;We do not service
customers, only garages, and besides, the price I quoted you would
only apply to garages, our regular price would be much higher,
goodbye&quot;

     I then tried a place called Triangle Auto Parts, and when I asked
if they had the CV, the guy answered &quot;Of course&quot;.  I almost got
offended at his response because he sounded as if I was stupid for
even asking if they were in stock, but then I realized that I needed
the CV and I wasn't in a position to care if the guy was rude or not
(which he wasn't, if I had lived in Orlando, I would have known that
they had them).  I then went to the park again, and when we returned
that night, I replace the joint, in the dark.  I think that is
something everyone should be required to do, with 2 crappy
flashlights, and no jack stands, so you have to lay under the bus,
with all the wheels on the ground.

     The next morning we returned the rental car, and spent our last
day in the park.  Then we headed to Shreveport La for thanksgiving.
The ride home was totally uneventful, except that it was cold, and
only one of the heat exchangers could be opened.  Finally it got so
cold (30 degrees or so), that I had to pull into a rest area, and
climb under the bus to tie the other heat exchanger open. It hadn't
been cold enough to do it on the way there, only on the way back.

     When we reached Louisiana, I had no low end power (ie I could
barely start from a stop).  I was sooo tired I could not think of what
it could be.  Then finally 2 days later, after I had gotten lots of
sleep, I decided to check what the point gap was.  I was 0&quot;.  I reset
them, and the bus ran perfectly all the way back to Austin.

     The only downside to the trip, was the fact that the engine was
burning oil.  In 3700 miles I used 6 quarts of oil.  IMHO that is
alot.  Unless I am mistaken, may it be time for a rebuild? I hope not.
Any thoughts?


Cheers,

David
