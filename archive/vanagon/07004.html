Subject: Re: anti-theft for diesel vanagons?
Date: Tue, 22 Nov 94 13:44:48 PST

&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; Has anyone considered an anti-theft device for the diesel vanagons?
&gt; I mean, not an alarm, etc?  What options are there for these things?
&gt; I have considered putting a relay over the glow plug line which would
&gt; only allow the glow plugs to heat if the switch is thrown, but there
&gt; are probably other alternatives which might be better.
&gt; Does anyone have an idea?

You could put a relay in the wire that runs to the fuel pump solenoid.  
This will have many fewer amps running through it than the glow plug line.

This also has the added benefit of camouflaging the Vanagon as a non
running vehicle, and will aid Mr. Thief in his determination to look 
for another vehicle to take for a joy-ride, rather than search for a
reason why the engine cranks but won't turn over.  If you have the 
starter isolated, Mr. Thief will look for the reason why the starter
won't run, since this is a common antitheft device.

While I'm the subject of car theft, has anyone thought of putting a note
on the instrument cluster that reads something like: &quot;Joe, flip the red
switch before cranking or the car won't start.&quot;

The red switch would trigger the creation of a hostile environment for
Mr. Thief:  Electrical shocks, loud sirens, red pepper and dye sprayed
from an extra windshield-washer pump, aimed at the driver's seat, smoke
bombs, etc.

This assumes that Mr. Thief can read the note, and will follow the directions
on it.

-Jim
