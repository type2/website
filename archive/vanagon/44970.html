Subject: Orig color of Propane Tank on '75 Westy?

A friend is almost done a complete restoration of his yosemite 
yellow '75 deluxe Westy.  It looks fantastic!  He wants to make 
sure the propane tank is painted the original color, but since the 
Campmobile manual is black &amp; white, he isn't sure of the correct 
color.  Anyone know for sure?
