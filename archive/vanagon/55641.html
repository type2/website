Subject: Re: SA Rear windows- hey, they open




&gt;if you look very carefully, you'll see that the windows are larger than the
&gt;euro/us/canadian vanagons. :(  and notice that the side body panels are NOT
&gt;the same shape ... the trim indention is gone and the sides are flatter.
&gt;take a look at the rear air intakes, too.

&gt;makes you wonder if they'd make one in left-hand drive. :)

Sorry Joel,

 - But I can not see any differences in the window sizes.
 - The side body panels are looking same, except the small body
  cladding at the front door. This body cladding are available
  as after-market on full length of the van. Note that SA Vanagons
  have no right sliding door.
 - I think the trim indentation only looking like gone, this could
  be more an effect of the picture.
 - The rear intake is an additional plastic part. This is available
  as an after-market too. And it fits the German Vanagons. I saw
  it mounted on a van. And on my feeling, it is looking odd.
 - The only difference, but I'm not sure, is the more rounded face
  of the SA Vanagon. I compared it with the test report about SA
  Vanagons in the V_at_L archives.
  When you look carefully on the outer headlights, they sit a little
  bit backwards. When you look carefully at the right and left edge
  of the upper grille, it looks like they are coming a little bit
  forward then the regular we know. Taking this into account I guess
  the upper face of the SA Kombi around the upper grille comes a
  little bit out and makes the face more rounded. And VW SA is using
  the standard headlights with the old frames.
 - I do not wonder, VW SA only makes left-hand driven cars.
