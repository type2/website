&gt; OK so now I've been initiated..
&gt; 
&gt; The fuel injection, power steering, alternator, exhust and heads have
&gt; been removed and cleaned.  No real evidence of leaking.  But now the
&gt; important stuff:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is it normal for the cylinders to have small amounts of rust on the
&gt;    water jacket side???
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Any suggestions where to take the heads for a valve job??
