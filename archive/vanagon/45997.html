Subject: Re: Rubber elbow connecting filler neck

This is for Steve Dolan's question on using silicone on gas tank connecting
boots:

I once posted that I did this for the lower connecting piece, using
silicone wrapped by a hunk of aluminum flashing and hose clamps.  (Coat the
flashing   hunk with lots of silicone, also coat the rubber piece and
surrounding metal, then use back of flashing to hold with hand, twist it
around, temporarily held it with piece of copper wire, then tightened it
all up with two screw clamps.  Silicone doesn't stick well to rubber, but I
was hoping to bridge over to the painted metal. It worked to the extent
that there are less fumes, but  filled tank still creates a gas smell on
hard left turns, might be the hole I know I have at the top of the upper
connecting piece?
