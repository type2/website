Removing Tar from Carpet?
Hi everyone,

OK, so Murphy the dog found some tar to step in this weekend.  So what if he
likes my Westie so much that he insisted on getting in and romping around before
I found the tar on his feet?

Any suggestions for removing tar from auto carpet?  From dog feet?

Thanks, and if possible please reply to the list and  my email (lansharks_at_batnet_dot_com)
as I'm currently off-list.

Hope you all had a fun, safe 4th.

Kirk out
