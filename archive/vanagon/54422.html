Subject: hard starting  87'

87 westy here.....and the cold weather has brought on a starting problem.
  dosnt want to.....
       i feel like i should know just whats wrong ...since ive been keeping
up with the list for a few months now.
       and i think i have a clue...but maybe not.  ;)   i suspect the coolant
temp. sensor(tho i have  no black smoke out exhaust...and when warmed
up..engine runs perfect)....
       ive been starting it lately by turning over a few turns,then
stopping..then turning over again.   or turn over a few times..then turning
over with the gas pedal floored.     i dont know why this works...but it
worked on my 81 westy also.   as if its flooding...and the pedal down clears
the over rich mixture.  im aware of a ground problem(  engine cuts out for a
second over big bumps) i think....and perhaps throttle switch is gunky????
  im just sort of waiting for things to get worse..or the weather to get
warmer before jumping into diagnosis,,,but if anybody recognizes my
symptoms....please offer ur opinions.
                        peace,    derato
