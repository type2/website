Subject: RE: **** VW Parts Dealer (Don't Skip Thi


I just wanted to let you and everybody else know that I used these people 
and the service delivery and price was out of this world.  It was more 
cheaper and more convienient to buy parts from Arizona then right here in 
New Jersey.  I have the list to thank for finding my Westy and buying it, 
trouble shooting a problem from the service bulletins, and finally buying 
the parts easily at a low price.

Thanks to the list,
Peter
