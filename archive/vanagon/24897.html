Subject: RE:VW of A alleged lawsuit


Now that we know that VW was offended by the innapropriate use
of their trademark in the proximity of an innapropriately dressed
female...

I wonder if they could do us a favor and extend the same courtesy
to VWT&amp;A and DB&amp;HVW!  8)



Only kidding...consider this a dead-end thread. The devil made me do it!!
