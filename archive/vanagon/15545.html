Subject: Re: Busses To Drown Vanagons?

&gt; (50-50%?) will still continue. There are a *lot* of 'dem pesky busses out
&gt; there. 
&gt; Derek Drew
&gt; 
Vanagons, we don't need no stinkin Vanagons, ugly son of bus, 
rectangular water pumpin piece of junk. Bus owners unite, lets form
our own list man, then both of them would sink into uselessness.  Sort
of like what happened to rec.photo after they split that newsgroup
up if anyone ever followed it.  Or like what would happen if they ever
split rec.autos.vw into H20 and Air Sucker.

OK, just kidding, seriously, the mix seems nearly perfect to me
and as a lot of Vanagon owners have been and may again be Bus
owners, so what the hell.  And of course like Derek says a lot of
things apply across the board particularly from late Bus to early
air cooled Vanagon, so lets all be happy, I love to see articles
about people lucky enough to be restoring 23 window splits but
avidly follow maniacs trying to stuff GTI engines into diesel
Vanagons as well so why don't we worry about 2 or 3 years from now
when it gets here, after all them ugly WasserBOXer (the vehicle not the
engine) things are going to pretty much be old common relics then as
well compared to the 5 or 10 new VR6 Eurovans that will be being sold
each year across the country.
