&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am *this* close to putting my Westy up for sale.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This afternoon, it sits in my driveway, dead, once again!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;For this week only, members of this list could get a very clean, '71
&gt;&gt;pop-top Westfalia, with a new (refurbished) top, new canvas, new tires,
&gt;&gt;not much rust (CA car, don't ya know), new non-running engine (FWIW),
&gt;&gt;for say, $1300.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;DON'T make me an offer!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Dave
&gt;&gt;'71 Westfalia &amp; SB
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

Dave, does that mean you are quitting the list as well? C'mon Dave, we are
going to miss you. Why don't you fix it up and stay with us?
