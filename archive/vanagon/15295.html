Subject: Free 1972 Parts Bus in Toronto

this will only be of interest to certain vanagon.lenti folks but thought i
would post it. this van looks abandonned IMHO, but if you start removing
parts and someone comes out screaming saying &quot;what are you doing to my
precious VW?!?!?&quot; don't blame me! People i've asked don't seem to know much
about the van.

There is an abandonned 72' Westfalia near the old mill subway stop. it has
been mostly stripped (i.e. no glass, minimal westy interior), but engine,
tranny and gas heater are still there as is the bottom half of the pullout
bed. and a complete poptop (with pretty decent canvas too) the van is
sitting in an area which is to have condo's built directly across the road
from the old mill subway stop. the area is surrounded by plywood, and the
van isn't immediately visible from the road. drive around the back and
you'll see the van.
