     Doesn't look like you're getting an answer to the 'blue spark' question.  
     The shift arm doubles as a switch which controls the back-up lights and the 
     start lock-out(so you can only start the engine when the trans is in park 
     or neutral).  The blue spark is just a little arcing going on and as far as 
     I know is normal.

Hey now,
The little plastic guard broke away from the automatic transmission 
shaft on my 85 Westy and now I can see a little blue spark every time 
I shift , is this normal? what is it? Also, I was wondering if anyone 
knows a cure for wind noise coming thru the driver's door when I'm on 
the freeway...will replacing the rubber take care of this? Thanks in 
advance for any advice,
Rick
