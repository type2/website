&gt; &gt;  Has anyone changed their Vacuum Advance on the Distributor to a
&gt; &gt; mechanical one as St. Muir suggests? If so, where can I procure one?
&gt; &gt; Will this change make any/much difference to my gas mileage? Does the
&gt; &gt; Bosche 009 come with a mech. advance? Thanks in Advance.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I replaced my dual-diaphragm vacuum advance distributor in my 73 with
&gt; an all-mechanical advance (009) model.  Part-throttle driveability
&gt; was not very good, and I have since gone back to the stock distributor.
&gt; Another VW book gives the advice, &quot;Don't second guess the VW engineers&quot;,
&gt; and in this case I think it applies.

    I would agree with David and disagree with Muir on 
this one.  I still have a &quot;009&quot; in my '66 bus with a 1600 
stock DP and am really starting to get tired of the 
irritating little flat spot at low RPM's and subsequent 
acceleration increase at about 2000 rpm, rearranging the 
back of the camper and sending the dog to the floor.  I'd 
like replace it with a stock vacuum advance distributor and 
am currently looking for one that would work well with the 
Solex 34-PICT-3.  Any suggestions as to what I should look 
for.
