&gt;I know that there is a fact list out there on this, but the original size 
&gt;was a 6.40 x 15 which I believe is about the same diameter of a 205/75 x 
&gt;15.  It is important to note that when folks complain about the low 
&gt;gearing of their older buses that the original tires were a few inches 
&gt;taller than the bug's which are often installed on the older splitties.

I always thought that the metric sizes referred to width in mm.  Then the 75 
means that the profile is 75% of the preceeding number.  In that case, 
205mm/25.4=8.1 in.  Pretty far from 6.4 in.  So: 6.4*25.4=162.56 or 165mm.

Any of this make sense?
