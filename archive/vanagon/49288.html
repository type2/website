Subject: long battery FAQ, if wanted

For those of you who need to know, I pulled a battery FAQ off the 4x4 group.
If you want a copy pls. mail me, it's long, 800 lines? Everything you ever
wanted to know, and more.  Lists who makes whose batteries, and
homepages/1-800-#s etc for the mfgs. bye, tim
