&gt; PS is jump starting an FI Vanagon ok?  

I think that jump starting any computerized FI car is a gamble.  If your
&quot;helper&quot; has a car whose voltage regulator is wacky, or whose alternator
is sending out spikes that may not affect his carb-driven engine, you
run the risk of frying bits of your Vanagon's FI system.  A neighbor
of mine refused to give me jump starts (for  my diesel Jetta) becuase he
had given a jump in the past with his Ford Ranger, and the when the recieving
running, it sent some wierd current back through the jumper cables and fried 
his computer.

Anyway, if you feel like gambling $800 for a new computer, go ahead and
get a jump start.  But if you just charge your battery enough to get
your fuel pump to deliver fuel, push starting is easy.  I can push
start my vanagon on a level parking lot, starting within 2 or 3 van
lengths.  I'm pretty small (130 lbs), which means that the vanagon
is only rolling at about a walking pace, but when I put it into first and let
that clutch out, and she turns right over.  (I left my lights on all day
once, and my wimpy battery gave out!  The starter wouldn't even turn over,
but the interior lights seemed as bright (or dim) as usual).

Of course, you might need a little more speed up in the frozen north
to overcome that thick oil.
