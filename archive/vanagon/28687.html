A very interesting trip would include the North Shore East of Quebec City
in the newly created state of Inner Quebecistan.  All kidding aside, the
trip to Tadoussac (literally &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in Montignard) at the mouth of
the Saguenay and then up to Lac St. Jean and back down to Bic, and around
the Gaspe and over into NH/Vermont is a very good trip. This
includes Whale Watching, Ferry rides and some great camping in the heart
of Lower Canada. All told 10-14 days.
