Subject: Re: Vanagon needs new tires

&gt;| &gt;TireRack lists Michelin LTX 195/75 14 in two ways:
&gt;| &gt;
&gt;| &gt;LTX M/S LT 195/75 R14 C
&gt;| &gt;&amp;
&gt;| &gt;LTX M/S P 195/75 SR 14 RWL

	Since the Vanagon is usually equipped with LTs, I would assume
you would get the LT (otherwise, take 10% off the max load rating and
everything else that using passengar car tires requires)...
