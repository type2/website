Subject: 91 Wesfalia Stalling Woes...

I'm looking for input here... we have a '91 Worstfailure that likes to
randomly die at intersections when you step on the gas.  Then it refuses to
start for several minutes, acting like it's suffering from vapor lock.  Or,
on rarer occasions, if you stop and go into a store for a few minutes after
driving for a while, and then come back out to leave it will sometimes
refuse to start for 10 to 15 minutes.  It performs this trick for us in
summer AND winter, so I've been told that vapor lock it's not.  There is no
particular pattern as to when this happens; sometimes it can be two or three
times a day, and we can then go for months without the problem happening.
But it almost always happens in the worst possible place... crowded
intersections, or on the freeway during stop and go driving during rush
hour, never in a safe, isolated place!  

Our local VW dealership says that:

1.  There's a percentage of the Westfalias that perform this trick for their
owners.

2.  VW doesn't know of a standard cure.

3.  They could randomly replace various electronic parts hoping to find the
gremlins, but this can be expensive and they don't want to try that trick.
(Which I'm thankful for... they could have said &quot;We'll replace EVERYTHING,
and then it will run again.&quot;)

My question for this group is have any of the other Westy owners experienced
the same problem, and actually found a CURE for it?
