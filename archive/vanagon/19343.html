So Martha Rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; The switch to Aqualon has solved that problem.  Aqualon is a 2 ply textured polyester duck fabric, coated with a PVC resin.  Unlike laminated vinyl,
&gt; Aqualon won't separate, crack or peel.
&gt; 
&gt; Aqualon has been used by the marine industry for boat tops and covers
&gt; for many years.  It has proven to be durable, stretch and shrink
&gt; resistant, color fast, stain resistant and water repellent.
&gt; 

The only concern I have with this stuff is, as with all plastics/polyesters is
what am I exposed to as it outgasses?  As it heats up, and if I'm laying down
in the upper bunk, well I be breath some toxic fumes, eh?
