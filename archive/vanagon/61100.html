Subject: Re: VR6 in a Vanagon?

 &gt;&gt; Some guys near Cologne did this swap. I found an article in 'VW Scene'.
 Not very technical, but there is a picture showing the engine inside
 the engine compartment. It extends about 20 cm above the bay lid. But
 the mechanic had to built an own adapterplate to fit the engine and
bellhousing. Not an easy choice of an engine swap. &lt;&lt;

 Sounds like a hassle compared to the Subaru swap stories I've been reading. 
My '88 Wolfsburg just crossed 106k and the heads have been done recently so I
think, I *think* I'm in the clear (knock wood, grip Ken Griffey Jr baseball
card, turn three times and spit) for a while.

 Thanks for the information Helmut!
