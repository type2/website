Subject:      front heater fan problem on '84 Vanagon

When switching on the heater fan the other day, I got more than
heat... I got the smell of burning plastic and insulation, and no
heater fan movement. The fan switch also got very hot. None of the
speeds work.

Looking at Bentley's, there is an in-line resistor to the fan motor,
then the fan motor in a complicated welded housing. Could this problem
be the resistor, or the fan having burned out? It seems like a
horrible job to get that fan out. Anyone have any experiences with
this repair?

I couldn't figure out if the heater core itself is in the housing. If
so, I imagine the cooling system has to be drained to get the housing
out.

Thanks,
