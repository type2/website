Subject: RE: aftermarket seats


I remember a VWT&amp;A etc. '70s bus fixin' article that mentioned using Porsche 
914 seats, I think the passengers one in the 914 doesn't slide though, just 
like my '71 Westy.  They are thin, maybe thinner than vanagon ones. Those of 
you with a Recaro hankering can pull them from some Sciroccos and top end 
sport Jettas, some labelled recaro, others not, mid 80s?.  There was some 
discussion of these in rec...vw  a while back. I don't know if they fit 
buses however. Doubt they've got those folding armrests though, all I really 
need now is a folding tray table and a miniature bag of peanuts anyhow.
        And if you want custom fit, then just mold your torso + butt in 
plaster of paris fracture bandages while sitting in your ideal bussing 
position and send me the mold. I scan these in 3D and then CNC seat cushions 
out that will lock you and 'your boys' right in snugly.  Normally this is 
for wheelchair handicapped, but for list members ..... why not?  So go buy 
that carbon fiber race bucket you've been lusting after in the VWT&amp;A ads, 
the seat not the BBBBimbo, and send it along too.  Tim Smith

'humourously' for mixed audiences)
