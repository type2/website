&gt;&gt;I can not register the '68 because it will not pass smog the DMV tells me I

&gt;&gt;if A) I want to put it back together or B) when I want to get rid of the
&gt;&gt;'remains'?  Also, the DMV tells me that I can not transfer title or
&gt;&gt;register the '69 because it has no engine.  I just want to little slips of
&gt;&gt;paper that have my name on them.
&gt;
&gt;Oh what joy it must be to live in Kalifornia. ;)

Hmm, this would be an understatement.  (yes, that drip WAS sarcasm, wipe it
up quick as it burns :-)

&gt;
&gt;I'm probably missing something, but why are you telling DMV about the 68 at
&gt;all? Sure, it's some sort of Federal felony to replace a 69 engine with an
&gt;identical 68 engine, but nobody *here* will tell. ;)

Well, quite frankly I am not.  I just have a similar situation in both.
The '69 needs to be title transfered at least but the DMV says I can not
register an 'incomplete vehicle' (it has no engine)

The '68 could be transfered and registered except it won't pass smog (it is
1.75% over on the C02 but okay elsewhere excpet it is missing a
Thermostatic Air Cleaner Tube)  Idle is 964 which seems a little high.

&gt;
&gt;If I remember right, you were posting the numbers a while back from a
&gt;compression test that indicated excellent rings but you had symptoms of a
&gt;sloppy valve guide. In the 68. Is that right, I'm a little hazy? This is
&gt;why the 68 won't pass smog?

Yup.  This is the case.

&gt;
&gt;So switch the engines out, and when you do it, bolt a couple rebuilt heads
&gt;on the 68 engine. If you're really broke, just do the one with the loose
&gt;guide. We're talking about ~$150 for both of them. That should smog easily.
&gt;You don't even have a charcoal canister in the 69, right? You'd have to
&gt;smell like burning tires to fail smog in that, I would think.

No, I do not think I have the filter (just learning you see) Hmm, I can do
this.  I was going to tear the entire engine down to learn the ins and outs
and start fresh but need to do the damned paperwork first.  Ach du leiber!

&gt;
&gt;To get rid of the corpse of the 68, do what all other mass murderers do;
&gt;cut it up and distribute the bits. ;) I have a 68 wish-list myself, let me
&gt;know if you're going to part it out.

Hmm, I will keep this in mind.  Of course, a scrap metal hulk sitting in
front of my garage would probably not go over well with the landlord! :-)

Thanks and hope I can get closer to a solution
