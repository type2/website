Subject: CABINET DOOR HANDLES?


Is there a replacement, preferably in metal, to the handles on cabinet   
and icebox that will work for my 74 westie.  I was going to look at some   
at a local big hardware place but would like some information before I   
start.  I don't care If they are original or not, but something sturdy   
that can stand up to some abuse.  Seems like every Westie I have seen   
needs at least one.  Please me direct because I'm on digest mode at work.   
  Thanks  Erick.
