&gt; tranny. The list of trannies that Helmut sent shows one with a 4.86,
which
&gt; would be ideal. Anyone know of a source for that R&amp;P gear?

Weddle Engineering in Long Beach, CA, list the 4.86 in their price list,
and the price for a used set is...
 
$325.00 ! 

Their phone number is 310-598-2731.
