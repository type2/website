Subject: Re: checking transmission

&gt;engine, for example, and that can be performed in, say, less than an hour,
&gt;without taking everything apart. 
&gt;
&gt;If the only way is a test-drive, what experiments would you suggest?
&gt;


Just wondering....   with the engine/input shaft locked up, and one output 
shaft also, how much rotation can you get out of the other (output) shaft.  
Try other combo's too.  This should indicate if much wear has ocurred to 
gear teeth etc., but I guess you would need a brand new properly set up 
trans as your 'gold standard'.   Or maybe a brand new but properly broken in 
trans???  Better check the magnetic plug for type of debris, fine powder OK, 
chips Uh-uh!, Does the oil smell badly burnt, can you see blue coloured 
gears (ie. cooked) through the drain plug.  Any clunking/sticking of shafts 
when rotated?  Are the splines on the input shaft twisted. 

hmmm. test drive?  well if you can pick up any drop in RPM with the clutch 
engaged/not, in neutral, you have a really far gone input shaft bearing. 
Groaning etc. under acceleration/up hills indicates a bad output shaft 
bearing sometimes.  Loud grinding noises are a definate giveaway ;&gt;  Maybe 
you could hang from the underside with a mechanics stethoscope in your ear 
while someone drives around a while?.   It's a crap shoot, go for it Sami.
