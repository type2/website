Subject: Re: Replace Headlights?

I installed Hella H-4 lights, and they are amazing compared to the stock
lamps.  The low beam is designed to light up the right roadside, while
keeping the light low, under the eyes of oncoming drivers.  The high beams
just flood the road with light, far into the distance.  Be careful, if you
ever need to take the car to inspection, throw in the old lamps, because
the H-4's are not street legal.  (God knows why...)
