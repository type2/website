well, i finally dunnit.  got meself home access.  the subterrainean 
subterfuge is no longer necessary, the cloak and dagger done, the bean 
pots' been licked clean.

Hello.  my name is Dan Houg and i'm a vanaholic.  a few old timers may 
remember me.  as the saying goes..&quot;I'm baaa-ack&quot;

please feel free to communicate with me via &quot;fairwind_at_northernnet_dot_com&quot;

i still have the '87 Westy (with tent, rear facing seat, triple fridge 
fans, and chili pepper lights) and am still goofy about vans.

-dan (well, sorta.  i'm kinda 'Barb' when i'm at home)
