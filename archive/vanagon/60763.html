PINKNEWELL_at_aol_dot_com just wrote me to say:
&quot;I just got the August '97 VW Trends in the mail today and there on p. 62 
is the Resto From Hell !!  Nice shot Rusty!&quot;

Ellis sez:
I haven't seen it yet! I guess subscribers get their magazines last. Can 
anyone report as to what show it was shot at? Please tell me that they 
*didnt* describe it as &quot;Sano.&quot; =) Besides it's just barely June, Trends has 
the August issue out and they are probably reporting on an April or late 
March show. Hmmm. Crud, no wonder I have fun keeping up with the times...
