Subject: Should I replace my AT with a 4 speed?

On the way home from church yesterday, my 87 Vanagon's AT tranny was making
a high pitch whine. Hoped to make it home but at a stop light, she wouldn't
go when the light turned green. Checked the fluid. Looked OK. Just wouldn't
go in any gear. Rats! :-(  She has 141K on the motor/tranny. Motor was
rebuilt at 127K. Had an ATF cooler leak at 137K which pretty much poluted
the AT fluid with coolant. Was warned then that the AT may not be long for
this world. Looks like they were right.

So anyway, I happen to have this 82 parts Van with a 4 speed and all the
linkage. If I were to get a new (or used?) flywheel, pressure plate,
throughout bearing wouldn't this work??? What else am I forgetting about
before I go off and spend too much money? Anyone have a pressure plate off
of a blown up 2.0 wasserboxer?        

As always your advice (and condolenses) are always appreciated.
