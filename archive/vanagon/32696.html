Subject: Lock Trouble...help!


hey now,

i stopped at cup of joe today to get some coffee (3 double espressos! whoa!).
i went to unlock the van after the coffee and when i did, the most 
amazing thing happend. i inserted the key on the drivers side and 
unlocked the door. when i took the key out, the lock was still attached! now,
i can still lock the door but of course i have to enter through the 
passenger side! any ideas how to fix this? i've got all the parts though 
the mechanism kinda fell apart.
