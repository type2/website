&gt;well, it CAN be done, but i'm not so sure you'd want to ... all that &quot;vent&quot;
&gt;thingie consists of is a plastic box with a piece of foam in it. and the
&gt;only difference (that i can see) in the glass is that it is shorter.
&gt;
&gt;as i understand it, the plastic vent thingie is to allow air to be sucked
&gt;out the back, if you open the dash vents. otherwise it does nothing.
Thses vents work to let air out of the van anytime air is comming into the
van.  Air might come into the van through the windows, dash vents, defroster
vents, dash floor heater vents, or the vents placed above the windows (kinda
along the roof line) in the rear passenger area.  Typically when using the
air conditioner all of these hot air inlet sources would be closed and there
would be no use in having the rear window exhaust vents or the front-doors
exhaust vents open.
&gt;
&gt;to cool down the rear, put some tint on the windows ... this REALLY makes a
&gt;difference in the temperature inside. and you can get the stuff at k-mart
&gt;and put it on yourself (just follow the directions carefully). the vanagon's
&gt;(or buses) windows are flat and very easy to work on. the only problem's
i've
&gt;had (in putting the tint on) were the handles for the sliding windows, and
&gt;being very very careful on the rear hatch window when trimming the tint (so
&gt;you don't cut any of the defroster wires).
&gt;
I can vouch for the effectiveness of the window tint.  I've had it
professionally done on both my vans for around $100. each.
