Subject: Re: Hydraulic to solid lifters?

&gt;...Now I know they went to steel pushrods for the hydraulics,
&gt;but did the length change? did the cam change? can I do this, I know
&gt;people go the other way.  Is this a stupid ides?

John:
Every performance cam for h2o VWs comes in 2 versions: for solid lifters,
and for hydraulic lifters. I think if you want to do it right, you'll have
to replace lifters and cam together.

Good luck.

Enjoy,
Dave
