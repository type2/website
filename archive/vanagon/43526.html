Joe,

Spark-plug air-compressors have been around for a long time but they don't
work the way you probably think.  The spark-plug air-compressor is in fact a
separate one-cylinder compressor, bore &amp; stroke about 1x2.  It uses the
compressed gasses in the combustion chamber to power its own piston, which
pumps ambient air.

If you try inflating a tire with a fuel/air mixture from your engine you'll
be in for a noisy surprise.
