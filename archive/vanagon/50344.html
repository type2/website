&gt;
&gt; Hi all:  If you have a little time you might want to read this and
understand a little more about the scum that make us give them money in the
name of &quot;enviromentalism&quot;. The last I heard Envirotest holds contracts in
all 50 states. Two states are trying to get away without much success.

&gt;&gt;	Car-test firm has big clout
&gt;&gt;      Envirotest founder uses government=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;BY Thomas Frank Denver=20
&gt;&gt;Post Capitol Bureau
&gt;&gt;PD * 07/28/96=20
&gt;&gt;SN Denver Post=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Three years after he launched Envirotest Systems Corp. on a bet
&gt;&gt;that new environmental regulations would spell prosperity for an
&gt;&gt;automobile-emissions testing company, Chester C.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Davenport demonstrated how he would use government to
&gt;&gt;guarantee success. Envirotest was in its brief, dizzying golden
&gt;&gt;age in the autumn of 1993, hitting the jackpot in Colorado, New
&gt;&gt;York and Pennsylvania with contracts worth more than $1 billion.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In just three months, its stock soared 50 percent.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Suddenly, the company based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was about to
&gt;&gt;lose a $150 million contract with Connecticut, where an
&gt;&gt;evaluation committee had unanimously recommended hiring a
&gt;&gt;competitor. Davenport struck back.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Within nine days, Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker heard from
&gt;&gt;his former chief of staff and campaign manager, who was
&gt;&gt;lobbying for Envirotest; another Envirotest lobbyist, whom
&gt;&gt;Weicker knew from the island of St. Croix, where both owned
&gt;&gt;vacation homes; the state treasurer; and the chairman of one of
&gt;&gt;the largest companies in Connecticut.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson called to tout Envirotest as a
&gt;&gt;minority-owned firm. Davenport's team raised so many doubts
&gt;&gt;about the recommended firm - which state officials had rated as
&gt;&gt;substantially better than Envirotest - that Weicker ordered
&gt;&gt;entirely new evaluations. ..........The new look led him to choose
&gt;&gt;Envirotest.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That contract and others have made Envirotest the largest
&gt;&gt;automobile-emissions testing company in the nation.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But the federally mandated inspections Envirotest conducts in
&gt;&gt;pollution-riddled areas such as Denver have created a backlash
&gt;&gt;in states around the country.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Inconvenienced motorists, out-of-work mechanics,
&gt;&gt;anti-regulatory politicians and dubious scientists have generated
&gt;&gt;a tidal wave of opposition to Envirotest's more sophisticated but
&gt;&gt;less convenient emission tests.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As states resisted federal inspection mandates and Congress
&gt;&gt;abolished them, the company's early promise has faltered along
&gt;&gt;with its stock price, which dropped from $28.50 a share in March
&gt;&gt;1994 to $1.875 on Friday.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yet in that withering climate, Envirotest has managed to grow,
&gt;&gt;nearly doubling its revenues and employees from 1992 to 1995.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It hired the best-connected lobbyists, built coalitions with
&gt;&gt;business and health organizations, took over competitors and
&gt;&gt;occasionally intimidated its opponents - as it did in Colorado
&gt;&gt;with a group of local service-station owners.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest emerged from the storm &quot;well-positioned ... as the
&gt;&gt;leader in the centralized emissions testing industry,&quot; according to
&gt;&gt;the most recent Wall Street analysis. But its zeal also has come
&gt;&gt;under attack.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In Connecticut, an outcry over Envirotest's victory prompted the
&gt;&gt;attorney general and state auditor to investigate.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The attorney general concluded that Envirotest's lobbying
&gt;&gt;&quot;directly affected the decision-making process and presented
&gt;&gt;the appearance of partiality and unfairness to the public.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;This office recommends that the governor reconsider his
&gt;&gt;selection of Envirotest,&quot; added the attorney general shortly after
&gt;&gt;the selection - to no avail.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest has shown how it works a political system in
&gt;&gt;Colorado, where it has fought to win and keep a seven-year,
&gt;&gt;$140 million state contract to administer new, high-tech
&gt;&gt;emissions tests for all 1983 or newer automobiles in the
&gt;&gt;six-county metro area.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The company's treadmill-style tests are aimed at identifying
&gt;&gt;polluting vehicles with more accuracy than previous tests, which
&gt;&gt;measured emissions while cars idled.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The state's goal is to reduce smog and help Denver meet federal
&gt;&gt;clean-air standards. Envirotest actually began lobbying even
&gt;&gt;before it could do business in Colorado.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In 1993, it hired the powerful Stealey &amp; Associates, which
&gt;&gt;pushed the legislature to launch a new emissions-testing
&gt;&gt;program it could bid to run.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When the state adopted the program and solicited bids,
&gt;&gt;Envirotest assembled a team featuring Steven W. Farber, the
&gt;&gt;chairman of Gov. Roy Romer's 1990 re-election campaign and a
&gt;&gt;major Romer fund-raiser, as its lawyer. Former Lt. Gov. Nancy
&gt;&gt;Dick was its real estate consultant, and former state Democratic
&gt;&gt;chairman Floyd Ciruli was its pollster.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest, although it was the highest bidder, won the state
&gt;&gt;contract because state officials were impressed with its
&gt;&gt;experience and financial soundness and the technical superiority
&gt;&gt;of its proposed program.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When one of the losing bidders complained, the state's health
&gt;&gt;director at the time, Dr. Patricia Nolan, told the disappointed
&gt;&gt;company president that Colorado was &quot;oriented more toward the
&gt;&gt;quality of services provided.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yet that quality was so poor when the new emissions program
&gt;&gt;began in January 1995 that legislators immediately began
&gt;&gt;seeking ways to abolish it.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Long lines at inspection stations produced a deafening motorist
&gt;&gt;outcry, which was fanned by service-station owners who had
&gt;&gt;lost business and a new crop of conservative legislators who
&gt;&gt;had been swept into office on the anti-government Republican
&gt;&gt;platform.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The backlash was so costly that Envirotest President F. Robert
&gt;&gt;Miller said the company is losing money in Colorado, its
&gt;&gt;second-largest market after Ohio.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest was hit with $436,200 in state fines in its first year for
&gt;&gt;898 violations of waiting-time limits and forced to hire new staff.=20
&gt;&gt;The company paid $142,602 in 1995 to seven lobbyists and
&gt;&gt;lobbying firms to beat back proposals that would have cost it
&gt;&gt;millions by limiting the program, and another $114,048 so far this
&gt;&gt;year. Its total lobbying bill since January 1993 is $331,550.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;If this contractor didn't have the political clout that they have,
&gt;&gt;there is no way that they would be in place today,&quot; said Sen.
&gt;&gt;Mike Coffman, R-Aurora, an Envirotest opponent.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest also has defeated foes outside the state House, with a
&gt;&gt;punch that has left them stinging. When a group of
&gt;&gt;service-station owners organized a ballot measure this spring to
&gt;&gt;let them inspect cars in competition with Envirotest, the
&gt;&gt;company shot back with its own ballot questions.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;One would have let anyone buying a car return it within three
&gt;&gt;days for a full refund - a prospect that so threatened the
&gt;&gt;Colorado Automobile Dealers Association that it dropped plans
&gt;&gt;to give garage owners $300,000 to help get their referendum on
&gt;&gt;the ballot.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest ultimately won when it persuaded the state Supreme
&gt;&gt;Court to declare the service-station ballot question invalid. But
&gt;&gt;its tactics left some angry. &quot;The kindest thing I could say about
&gt;&gt;that was it was a chess move,&quot; auto dealers President Bill Barrow
&gt;&gt;said of Envirotest's proposed ballot initiative. &quot;A very good
&gt;&gt;chess move.&quot; Some legislators called it &quot;blackmail.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest's Miller said it was &quot;just part of our approach to
&gt;&gt;protect our interests in Colorado.&quot; As much as Envirotest's
&gt;&gt;tactics have infuriated its opponents, they have pleased Wall
&gt;&gt;Street and impressed opponents.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;They've had a great strategy,&quot; said Peter J. Thornton, an analyst
&gt;&gt;at Duff &amp; Phelps Fixed Income who follows Envirotest. &quot;They'd
&gt;&gt;meet with the right committees and politicians, be fully plugged
&gt;&gt;into state political process.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Douglas Greenhaus, legal counsel for the National Automobile
&gt;&gt;Dealers Association, which opposed the new tests, called
&gt;&gt;Envirotest &quot;a very well-organized, hard-charging, very
&gt;&gt;well-financed company.&quot; Envirotest often has hired
&gt;&gt;well-connected lobbyists, in addition to those in Colorado and
&gt;&gt;Connecticut.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In New Jersey, it hired the governor's former campaign
&gt;&gt;co-chairwoman. In Minnesota, it hired the sister of the assistant
&gt;&gt;commissioner of the state agency that oversees automobile
&gt;&gt;emissions testing. In New Hampshire, it hired both the
&gt;&gt;governor's campaign chairman and a major campaign fund-raiser.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest's corporate counsel is Vernon Jordan, who was head
&gt;&gt;of President Clinton's transition team and is considered one of
&gt;&gt;the most influential figures in Washington. Jordan's law firm -
&gt;&gt;Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld - has given more money to
&gt;&gt;federal candidates through its political-action committee than
&gt;&gt;any other law firm, according to the Center for Responsive
&gt;&gt;Politics. Lobbying for stronger emissions testing is &quot;an important
&gt;&gt;initial step in marketing its services,&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest said in a prospectus for a 1993 public stock offering.
&gt;&gt;The company &quot;attempts to build support for the adoption of such
&gt;&gt;a program among environmental and health organizations.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;One prominent supporter of Envirotest has been the American
&gt;&gt;Lung Association. It has lobbied various state legislatures,
&gt;&gt;including Colorado's in 1993, and the federal government for the
&gt;&gt;stringent emissions tests.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The company has given the association $185,000 from 1992 to
&gt;&gt;1995, creating a relationship that has left some association
&gt;&gt;officials uneasy.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When legislators in Pennsylvania were considering breaking a
&gt;&gt;$60 million-a-year contract with Envirotest in 1994, the lung
&gt;&gt;association paid for full-page newspaper ads across the state
&gt;&gt;touting Envirotest and urging readers to=20
&gt;&gt;tell lawmakers of their support. Some lung association chapters
&gt;&gt;in Pennsylvania immediately distanced themselves from the ads.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;It's a relationship we tend to avoid,&quot; says Ginne Donahue,
&gt;&gt;promotion director for the American Lung Association of
&gt;&gt;Western Pennsylvania.=20
&gt;&gt;&quot;It's very beneficial to a company to have a tie-in with a
&gt;&gt;reputable national health agency. ... But we're essentially
&gt;&gt;becoming advertisers for that product, and that's not what we're
&gt;&gt;intended to be.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;From auto manufacturers to environmental groups, from the
&gt;&gt;Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry to the
&gt;&gt;Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Envirotest has had
&gt;&gt;many powerful allies in its quest for more stringent emissions
&gt;&gt;testing. None has been more influential than the federal
&gt;&gt;government.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The company grew out of an investment fund Davenport set up
&gt;&gt;in 1988 to buy companies poised to grow as a result of pending
&gt;&gt;federal legislation. He formed Envirotest two years later to buy
&gt;&gt;Hamilton Test Systems Inc., a small emissions-testing firm
&gt;&gt;owned by United Technologies Corp. of Hartford, Conn.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Borrowing from European banks, Envirotest paid $51 million for
&gt;&gt;Hamilton seven weeks after President Bush signed a massive
&gt;&gt;environmental law that, two years later, led the U.S.
&gt;&gt;Environmental Protection Agency to require 83 of the nation's
&gt;&gt;smoggiest areas - including Denver - to improve auto emissions
&gt;&gt;testing.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Until they were weakened late last year, the regulations created
&gt;&gt;huge new markets for companies like Envirotest - and raised
&gt;&gt;questions about their influence in having the regulations
&gt;&gt;adopted.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Some have suggested an &quot;incestuous&quot; relationship between the
&gt;&gt;government and Davenport, a former aide to the once-powerful
&gt;&gt;Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston of California and an assistant
&gt;&gt;transportation secretary in the Carter administration.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest said in company documents that it &quot;played a major role
&gt;&gt;in the development&quot; of the new emissions tests through a
&gt;&gt;contract with the EPA to test the technology.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest also joined the EPA in defending a lawsuit brought by
&gt;&gt;groups opposed to the new emissions regulations and seeking
&gt;&gt;to repeal them. &quot;We always had a suspicion that there was some
&gt;&gt;closeness between EPA and Envirotest, but we never had
&gt;&gt;enough evidence to say there was anything improper,&quot; says
&gt;&gt;Stephen Sayle, general counsel of the House Subcommittee on
&gt;&gt;Oversight and Investigations, which held hearings last year that
&gt;&gt;led Congress to drop the EPA's emission requirements.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Some cited an episode in Pennsylvania in 1994 when an
&gt;&gt;Envirotest lobbyist sent a copy of a legislator's proposal to scale
&gt;&gt;back the company's planned emissions program to a
&gt;&gt;Michigan-based EPA staffer who had helped develop the testing
&gt;&gt;technology. The staffer faxed the lobbyist back a memo - which
&gt;&gt;was circulated among legislators - stating that if the measure
&gt;&gt;became law, the EPA would impose sanctions &quot;leading to the
&gt;&gt;lapse of transportation plans and the end of highway project
&gt;&gt;funding.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Pennsylvania state Sen. Gerald LaValle, who sponsored the
&gt;&gt;measure, said it was &quot;highly irregular&quot; for an EPA staffer to
&gt;&gt;convey policy to a lobbyist instead of state officials. &quot;It appears
&gt;&gt;to me that an extremely cozy relationship has been established
&gt;&gt;between your agency and Envirotest,&quot; he wrote in a letter to EPA
&gt;&gt;Administrator Carol Browner.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Others see only shrewdness in Davenport, whose connections
&gt;&gt;to wealthy Washington developers have helped bring his net
&gt;&gt;worth to a reported $90 million and earn him the label of the
&gt;&gt;wealthiest black entrepreneur in American. Envirotest paid him a
&gt;&gt;salary of $834,376 in 1995.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Chester Davenport and a lot of smart, industrious people
&gt;&gt;understand that government is good for business,&quot; says Russell
&gt;&gt;Hinz, president of the Coalition for Safer, Cleaner Vehicles, a
&gt;&gt;pro-emissions-testing group of health organizations and
&gt;&gt;companies. &quot;It's called using the system to your advantage and
&gt;&gt;being a winner.&quot; Envirotest has shown equal enterprise in using
&gt;&gt;the legal system to grow.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In 1991, when negotiations broke down in Davenport's attempt
&gt;&gt;to buy a competitor, Systems Control Inc., Davenport filed two
&gt;&gt;lawsuits against the company's owner, Electronic Data Systems,
&gt;&gt;and suggested to reporters that he was the victim of racism.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;EDS officials responded that Davenport had hired a
&gt;&gt;public-relations firm and was trying to pressure them through
&gt;&gt;publicity over charges of racism.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It was a lawsuit Envirotest filed in a Minnesota county court in
&gt;&gt;1991 with a conflict-of-interest allegation that forced EDS'
&gt;&gt;hand. Envirotest said Systems Control's contract for emissions
&gt;&gt;testing in Minnesota was illegal because, as company lawyers
&gt;&gt;pointed out to state officials for the first time, EDS recently had
&gt;&gt;been acquired by General Motors. State law said a company that
&gt;&gt;inspects cars cannot also sell them.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Fearing that Systems Control no longer would be able to win
&gt;&gt;contracts, EDS quickly sold most of the company to Envirotest
&gt;&gt;for $83.5 million, making it the largest emissions-testing
&gt;&gt;company in the country.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Envirotest ultimately acquired the rest of it after the company
&gt;&gt;lost contracts in Texas, Michigan and Maine. In 1993, after
&gt;&gt;Envirotest lost a contract in Maine, it sued the winning bidder on
&gt;&gt;charges of fraud and settled the case by acquiring that
&gt;&gt;company's rights to a remote-sensing device that checks
&gt;&gt;emissions with a roadside sensor.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;It's a very wise thing for (Envirotest) to do,&quot; said University of
&gt;&gt;Denver scientist Donald Stedman, an inventor of the device,
&gt;&gt;noting that the EPA requires such testing in areas such as
&gt;&gt;Denver. &quot;It has the potential to be very profitable, and it has the
&gt;&gt;potential to put the (current emissions tests) out of business.&quot;=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The company's most significant legal victory occurred earlier this
&gt;&gt;year in Pennsylvania, where Envirotest spent an estimated $200
&gt;&gt;million setting up testing stations only to have its program
&gt;&gt;canceled. The state paid the company $145 million. &quot;They got a
&gt;&gt;very favorable settlement,&quot; Duff &amp; Phelps analyst Thornton said.=20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Most recently, Envirotest lost a $100 million emissions contract
&gt;&gt;in California despite a personal pitch from Davenport. The
&gt;&gt;company, which had fought so hard for its 65 percent of the
&gt;&gt;national emissions-testing market, is appealing the decision.=20
