Subject: Inuvik/Volkswagen World Article

Hi All,

Just read VWoA's Volkswagen World article entitled, 'True North: To the
Top of the World by Volkswagen'.  It gives a different perspective of the 
trip than the recounts on the net.  I was a little disappointed not seeing
Hoover's 65 in the pics, nor mention of him.  Oh well, whaddaya expect
from a Corporate Club Magazine.  All in all, a nice article from VWoA,
reflecting pride in their past, IMHO.  8-)
