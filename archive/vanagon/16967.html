Subject: Synchro Front Shocks?

Been looking for front shocks for my '87 Synchro. I had a good import part
store that could get me a pair of Boge for half of the VW  price....put the
place closed before I bought them!

My plan is to start calling around to places I've picked off the &quot;list&quot; and
out of VW Trends first thing Monday morning, but if any of you have
suggestions that might help zero in on some more likely sources, post a note
on the list. It looks like a lot of places carry restoration stuff and not
necessarily parts for later-model vanagons.

BTW I'm in upstate NY....not that that makes too much difference. Thanks.

Dan
