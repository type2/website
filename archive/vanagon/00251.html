Subject:       Re: Syncro Tech Info

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any technical info sources about the AWD system the 
&gt; Syncro uses?  I recently bought a syncro, and am curious about the
&gt; 4wd system.  And I can't read German, so sources in English would be 
&gt; most helpful!

Hi Jim, Welcome! You came to the right place. Hang around here for a 
while and you'll get an education on SYNCROS.
Fill us in on your new toy. What year is it and what type (7 pass or 
westi...pickup... 16&quot; wheels?)
