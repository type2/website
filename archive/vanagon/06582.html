&gt; 
&gt; 	Donald Baxter wonders:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When the engine is cold on this '85, the idle is about 900-1000 RPM.  
&gt; &gt; When warmed up to normal operating temperature the idle increases to 
&gt; &gt; 1400-1600 RPM.  The van also seems to be getting not so good gas 
&gt; &gt; mileage--not sure of the figures (and in fact, I don't know how much the 
&gt; &gt; tank really holds) but in 90 miles of driving, I have used 1/2 tank 
&gt; &gt; according to the fuel gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Don, 1400-1600 rpm is *WAY* too fast for idle! I'd suspect your
&gt; idle enrichment is on all the time, or the mixture is mis-adjusted.
&gt; There is a third, more illusive problem, which I saw on a Rabbit. The
&gt; O2 Sensor is fail-deadly- on the waterpumper inline-four, a bad O2 sensor
&gt; will drive the K-Jetronic system to full-rich, which will eventually
&gt; cause the poor catalytic converter to melt, giving one a truely wierd
&gt; set of symptoms to troubleshoot.
&gt; 
&gt; 	BTW, any excessive enrichment will have some effect on the cat,
&gt; if you have one- it tries to burn the extra gas.
&gt;

&gt;
A co-worker of mine had the same thing happen on his '81 Westfalia, with the
California version of L-Jetronic. The O2 sensor failed (he ignored the light
prompting him to change it) and his Catalytic converter &quot;loaded up&quot;. The 
symptoms were a smooth running, good sounding bus with a top speed of about
50 mph.
