&gt;If I might, somewhere between Dallas and Raleigh is Fall Creek Falls,
&gt;Tennessee, which is gorgeous. 

That looks great: my map shows it about halfway betweeen Nashville and
Knoxville, about thirty miles south of I40. I suggest this be timed
toward the end of August, so then some of us could caravan the 300 crow
miles to St. Louis for Buses By the Arch! Also, getting to the Fall
Creek location would also allow a nice caravan for the mid-atlantic
folks, along the lines originally proposed, across North Carolina from
the Sea to the (Tennessee) Mountains.
