Subject: VW Parts Catalogue is handy

At long last the VW Parts Catalogue &quot;Type 2 Mod: 1980 - 1985&quot; that I
ordered from VW Heritage has arrived.

It has next to no descriptive text, but has illustrations of all the parts.
I suppose its hard to think up names for all these thousands of 'bits'.

Already it has proved useful: in my 1982 Bus the middle row backrests fold
down for access to the rear, there is a highly shaped (basically triangular
but curved) plastic knob which you pull up on to let the backrest down. I
had always thought that one of them was far too loose and that maybe there
was something amiss. Sure enough the pictures showed that a tiny little
clip-like insert about 8mm long was needed. I asked for this at my main
dealer. He immediately fetched it and decided it was not worth charging
for. I inserted this small metal sleeve and the knob is now completely
secure.

The catalogue is very interesting 'reading' and I thought it was well worth
the GB#6.50 (including postage) that it cost.

No doubt all you old hands already have it?
