     Like many others, while restoring my '56 sedan I would myself 
     returning to the same VW dealer. Their support was amazing. One 
     day the boss came over to the parts counter and said that I could 
     have a 15% discount on all spares, any time. Pushing my luck, I 
     asked why. His reply was that VAG couldn't buy the kind of 
     advertising an old restored vehicle represented. In the end they 
     were even loaning me strange tools with strange numbers. 
     
     Isn't is strange/ironic/sad that all the stories about good
     service from VW comes from Europe? [sigh for VWoA]
     
     BTW....was it &quot;our&quot; Bob Hoover that Paul Harvey mentioned
     this morning was going back to Oshkosh?
