Subject: gassy  oil

a friend of mine (no really - this isn't happening to me) has a split with an
annoying gasproblem - the oil keeps getting gas in it.  (1600 SP)  I saw it,
checked the dipstick - and it was 2 quarts high, smelled like gas to me- and
of course was very  thin.  It wasn't that long since he changed the oil, but
was of course vague on distance/ time, though he didn't even drive it to
town.   He  changed the fuel pump (twice) and even bought a new carb.   He
only lives a quarter mile from work, so he doesn't drive too much, but what a
hassle!

any suggestions?   comments?    gas (fart) jokes?
