    Hey you guys,
    
    Just order something from them, i.e., send them some $$$, and they'll be
    glad to pay attention and send a catalogue with the order.
    &gt;........

Since I am probably one of several who only
knows of them from this list and only knows
how to reach them via their non-functioning
AOL account, perhaps you could tell me what
the physical address is?
