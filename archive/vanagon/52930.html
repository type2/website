Subject: Re: 1.6 litre diesel heads - regular vs


&gt;        Since I cannot find a source of the damaged pre-combustion chamber
&gt;cap, I now must replace the head on my turbo-diesel vanagon.


Sorry, Gary, I gave you a wrong hope:

I received a phone call from my VAG dealer and this is the
answer: The steel caps you requested are not available as
spare parts, only as already built-in into the heads.
Exchange heads (TD) will cost DM 1000.- for German customers,
and maybe additional DM 500.- for Canadian because of
shipping expenses.

Another story are steel caps for the Eurovan Diesel. They
are available as spare parts, but they are different from
the Vanagon Diesels.
