Subject: Antenna Replacement (Ahhhhh...) and bye for awhile

Thanks for all of your advice re: replacing the Gray Ghost's antenna (boy,
does the radio sound Goooooooood again!)  Per usual, it did not go smoothly
(the &amp;*##%$ nut on top wouldn't come off, forced it a wee bit and bent the
sheet metal a little), but it's finally on.  The next time will be a lot
easier.

I'll be off the list for awhile, and when I come back next week, I'll be
using a different screen name to keep my mail separate from the list.

Take care y'all, thanks again, and I'll be back soon!

Cliff
