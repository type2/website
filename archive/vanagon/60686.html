Subject: Valve adjust &quot;DONE&quot;

Hello all: Thanks to everyone who replied to my call for help...
My SO's 85 camper had a very loud tapping noise from the engine.... I
discovered that it was the #4 ex valve lifter not pumping up.....Last
night add a can of &quot;Motor Flush&quot; to the oil after running engine until
hot..... idled for 5 mins and the drained.... let drip for over 1 hour..
changed filter and added new oil... ran at idle for 15 mins..... drained
again, changed filter.... filled crankcase with new oil and fired up
engine..... &quot;Ta dah!&quot; lifter pumped up no more noise and the engine is
running smooth again....
I'm glad I don't have to tear into the engine to replace a lifter.....
Peace be with you,
Doc
