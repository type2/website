Subject: Speedometer - Help
Date: Tue, 15 Jul 1997 17:55:17 -0400

I just picked up my 81 Westy from the shop where I had the front brake
pads replaced (seem to wear out quick!).  Turns out the front right one
was worn through and the rotor needed machining.  Problem is, now my
speedometer isn't working at all, nor is the odometer.  Did they just
fail to reattach something?  If so, can I easily reattach it?

Thanks!
