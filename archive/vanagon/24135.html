Subject: Tool-kit Wanted

I am looking for a VW Toolkit.  They are a round flat can thet bolted 
in the spare tire wheel.  I think they come in pouches, too and other 
forms.  I think they are made by Hazet and Stahl Wille tool companies 
in Germany.  I think they were an option circa 50's thru 70's.  Anyone 
who has tool kit or tools please email me at Obetron_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com
Thanks!
