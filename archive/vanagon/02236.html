well, i rooted around in my hovel and came up with some old tests from some
magazines. here's what they had for compression ratios:
1961 - 7.0:1     1984 - 8.6:1
1970 - 7.5:1     1986 - 8.6:1
1979 - 7.3:1     1990 - 8.6:1
1980 - 7.3:1

so if any OUGHT to need the higher 89 or 92 octane, you'd think my 88 bus
would. BUT!! see, it all depends on so many different things. the gas in
my area might not BE 87 or 89 or 92. how do we know what octane the stuff
really is? and carbon deposits in the cylinder head can raise compression
enough to need higher octane (which might be bradley's problem ... or maybe
milled heads?).

but mine does fine on 87. in fact, i can't tell any difference in the 87
from the 89 from the 92. but i still run a tank of the 92 every now and
then ... just old wives' tales and habit. supposed to 'clean' things out a
bit. ???

&gt;Wouldn't the answer be that the higher grade provides more power but only
&gt;if in the event we wanted to advance the ignition past the point of
normal ie 6 degrees atdc?

i had always heard that when you hot-rodded or suped-up an engine, you'd
have to go to higher octane. but that was because almost always, one of the
things-to-do was raising the compression.  i know someone who got a new 94
mustang 5.0 liter, and his owners manual said to run 87 ... but it pinged
badly on his local gas. so he has to run 92 to keep it from pinging. now
that's HIS car in HIS city.

i also have a 93 honda accord (oh, the SHAME of it all ...) and it does not
like the local 87 octane. it runs fine on 89 though. go figure. doesn't do
any better on the 92.

so i think you might just have to experiment (like with tires) and find what
seems to make YOUR car in YOUR town run better. in bradley's town, they might
be cutting the gas with alcohol or something, so his 87 octane is really only
80 or some such.  i've gotten what i thought were tanks of 'bad gas' a couple
of times over the years. mostly from little out-of-the-way El-Cheapo stations.
which brings up the old story about always buy gas from a busy station - cause
they (a) don't have time to dilute the gas,
     (b) get refilled more often (and that prevents any dilution)
     (c) make enough money (so they don't need to dilute the gas)
     (d) are watched more closely (by who?)
     (e) all of the above.
     (f) none of the above except (e)

it would be interesting to see if anybody else out there has any long term
data on their buses fuel usage. i find it very hard to believe that i am
the ONLY one that keeps track of that stuff. maybe the only one with it
on a computer. maybe.

come on, you Retentive Reprobates! Fess up!
