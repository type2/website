Subject: vanagon double cab

yes, im not really into the later vws so much, but i saw this one that was
really neat

it was a Tri- Star, which is a four door synchro double cab vanagon, with
 bucket seats front and back.  It had an auxiliary heater stashed under one
of the rear seats.  

And it had a roll cage!  this was really wierd.  It came up across the front,
like the hurst bumpers,  dont worry about a mashed nose here, and over the
top, along the sides, etc  

not only that, but there was a very hefty looking winch attached to the front
bumper.

 ready for the amazon.......
