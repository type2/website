Subject: High beam indicator ?

Hello All,

Does anyone know if the high beam indicator by law needs to be blue?

My Vanagon failed inspection beacause of this.  My temps are near out of 
time.

Does it need to be in the original location? I have already replaced the bulb , 
does any one know the resistor value thats in series with the lamp?

I an gonna put my own indicator lamp temporarily on the dash. is this legal?
