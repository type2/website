esting situation. While rotating my tires yesterday,
I  noticed that my rear shocks were leaking at 60,000 miles.  So a call to
the local parts house listed a &quot;Not Available&quot; listing.   One call to the
local VW dealership yielded the option of two different shocks for a 93' EV.
 One set called the &quot;standard&quot; set was designed for payloads of 800-1200kg.
 The other was designed for use with &quot; Lowered Running Gear&quot; option and have
a payload of 2000kg.  

The standard shocks list for $135.00 each!!! and can't imagine what the HD
shocks list for.  To determine which shocks are needed I will either have to
read the part no. off of the existing shocks or maybe by the VIN #.

Any suggestions?  Aftermarked?    Keep on driving?

Thanks for any help,
