Subject: Re: Manassas Bugout.

Hey, Ill be there as well.

Sorry I could not make the DC meeting. Due to traffic problems
in PA (bad roads), I did not get back to DC until about
7:30. It owuld have been 8:30 by the time I got there. Sorry.

I will definately be doing the Bug-out. I have been
trying to talk my friend (who lives five minutes
from the motorway) to let me 'borrow' his place
for a meeting place, etc. Maybe.

But, We definately need some way to identify each
other. I might whip up a T-shirt with vanagon_at_lenti
on it or something, or paint it on my Bus with tempra paint.
Let me think about that one. 

I might also pay to get into the show, though my Bus is
about as far from restored as you can get. (Just gotta
keep the guys who run the engine blow away from it, they 
might be looking for donations)

See you guys there!
