Subject: '84 Westy still alive &amp; kicking 

Hi all.  

Betty has been resurrected.  Thanks to everyone for the advice.  It turned
out that the water temp sensor was the culprit.  The wire was shorted out
due to sizzling against the exhaust.  An easy fix and we are on our way
again.  10K miles into our trip and 9 breakdowns later we've decided to cut
the tour back and start making our way home to Or.  Our vanagon adventure
has been a wonderful educational experience.  I have now replaced the
exhaust system (with list help), adjusted valves, fixed a blown coolant hose
(what a mess),  adjusted the timing, along with all of the regular
maintenance and various minor repairs.  When I first bought this van 10
months ago I only knew to put gas in it and change the oil once in awhile.
I like the change.

We will be at the Phish show in Plattsburgh, NY and then it is time to putt
our way back west.  Look for us along the way (84 yellow westy w/ list
sticker, Vt plates).  Strangely I have not yet seen another list sticker
along my travels.  Where is everyone?
