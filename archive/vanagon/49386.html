Subject: Mouse Milk: Here's more info!

Last week I asked about &quot;Mouse Milk&quot; after I found a reference about it in
the archives.  I just found a posting in my &quot;Vanagon&quot; mailbox from back in
Jan. which I didn't bother to read but filed away knowing that I might want
the info one day.  See, I knew there was a reason that I filed away all
this useless junk!

I've reposted the whole string for all to see.  If anyone can shed more
info on this stuff please do.  Such as: what is it made of, is it really
better than WD-40 (or is it the same stuff: different label), a cheap
source for it.

&gt; &gt; I'm looking for some suggestions on penetrating liquid to use to
&gt; &gt; free up bolts that have probably not been moved in 30 years.  I've been
&gt; &gt; using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
&gt; &gt; there that is better.


&gt;I like Mouse Milk.  I get it at the pilot shop at the Palo Alto airport.  It
&gt;is very effective at loosening corroded nutz'n'boltz.
&gt;
&gt;Try the yellow pages under airplanes and look for a store that sells supplies
&gt;to pilots: charts, headsets, leather jackets, sunglasses, very very large
&gt;watches and so on.  If they also have safety wire, oil filters and landing
&gt;light bulbs, chances are they'll have Mouse Milk.
&gt;
&gt;No really, that's what it's called.  Picture of a mouse in a jumpsuit with a
&gt;wrench on the bottle and everything.  No, I don't know where they get it
&gt;from...
