Gary,

I've had excellent luck with Zemco, but they have not been available in my 
area for several years.  Other list members have reported that they are 
available though in their areas.

What I like:

1) Ease of installation.  Uses the ignition for speed sensing, and
   clutch sensing.  Single module for electronics and vacuum motor.

2) Cost.  (Low.)

3) Reliability.  I have done at least 5 installations of these
   units over a dozen years and I have never seen a failure.

Mike
