Subject:      New Style Spark Plug Wires

Has anyone replaced their spark plug wires with ones having the
new style connectors which require the distributor cap to have
the little studs down in the holes?

I've just installed a set without realizing the difference and things
didn't fit right.  I looked in Bentley, and found reference to the
new style, which they recommend upgrading to, and determined that
I needed the new distributor cap.  So I bought a new cap, the wires
clicked in nicely... But the coil wire does not click into the coil
tightly.  Does this mean that I need to replace the coil as well
with one with a little stud in the hole, or is there some kind of
adapter that I need???

Thanks,
