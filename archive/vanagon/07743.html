Subject: Syncro Parts Interchange?

Syncro Owners:

Does anyone have or know where we might find a cross reference for 
Vanagon Syncro parts with the Syncro parts from Quantum Syncros and/or 
Audi Quattros?

It would certainly be a boon if many of these parts are shared, as 
there are probably more Audi Quattros sitting in wrecking yards around 
the country than the total number of Vanagon Syncros imported into the 
US. And in the Seattle area, I've seen low mileage Quantum Syncros 
(the whole car) selling for less than the price of a rebuilt Vanagon 
Syncro transmission.

Any ideas?

Paul
