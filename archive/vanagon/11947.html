Subject: Re:  ADVICE/Info Needed!

&gt;&gt;     I am wondering what my options are as to replacing the original engine
&gt;&gt;  in a ('50-'79) bus with a water-cooled engine so I can have some *real*
&gt;&gt;  heat...what specific engines will work? And how must the heating system be
&gt;&gt;  modified? Any information on this type of modification would be greatly
&gt;&gt;  appreciated! 
&gt;
&gt;It would be A LOT easier, and cheaper, I think, to put in a gas heater,
&gt;either aftermarket, or original, if you can find one. You can get a
&gt;rebuilt one for about $500-$600, and be toasty warm, without going to a
&gt;lot of trouble to put in a water-cooled engine.
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;      Also- I have never seen a VW camper before. Could someone tell me
&gt;&gt;  about what the layout of stuff inside a camper is like? And any other
&gt;&gt;  differences between a camper and a regular &quot;bus&quot;?
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;depending on the year, it will contain various arrangements of folding
&gt;beds and cabinets. Some have tops which pop up, and some of those have
&gt;extra beds up there. It totally depends on the year...
&gt;anyway
&gt;all this is of course my opinion.

I have seen a 71 bus with what looked like a rabbit engine in it.  The thing 
wasn't running when I saw it, and the job looked like a whole lot of rigging 
to get it to work.  He had a small heater core in the cab, and when I saw 
it, it was parked at school, with the motor out in the cargo area.  I can't 
help thinking that he couldn't get the thing to work with the stock tranny.
