Subject: Re: Baby Seat in Westfalia

We recently installed a baby seat in our '77 Westfalia for Alex - our 9 
month old son.  We had no problem with the seat belt part -- the 
difficulty arose with the issue of the 'tether strap' that most if not 
all baby seats require.  This is a strap that attaches from the rear of 
the seat to the frame of the vehicle.  Most newer models have a specific 
tether area, but in 1977 .....?  I wasn't very keen in drilling any new 
holes into the frame (especially directly behind the baby seat where I 
discovered the fuel tank lies, and behind that the engine well).  I 
wound up buying more tether cord and tethering the frame of the baby 
seat to the bolt where the rear seat attaches to the frame, on both 
sides.  This works perfectly, and the rear cushion still fits.  Now we 
can tackle those corners with Alex strapped in no problem.
