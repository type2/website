Steve Writes:
&gt;Splitties have great points, and I'd never cut them down in all seriousness.
&gt;Personally, I like driver's and passengers' windows that roll down, and
&gt;rear wheels that stay vertical regardless of load. I DON'T like having to
&gt;have a special (busmount) engine case, and not being able to mount many
&gt;of the aftermarket oil coolers/filters because the engine hanger gets in
&gt;the way.
&gt;

And in a picky moment I say:
        Seems to me we're talkin' different genres here. Pre-'68 busses
don't require rearmounts, and the special case. It's only '68-71 that work
that way. So splitties are saved from that purgatory that we in the early
breadloaves must endure. You do have a point about the windows that roll
down, but IMHO this is offset by the wonderful option of safari
windows-almost as good as a bike! Ok, I'll shut up.

Eddie, who desperately wants a pre-'68 westy.  I know, dream on...

Peace,
