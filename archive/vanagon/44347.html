hey now,

i asked this awhile ago but haven't gotten much of answer...anyone bought 
one of these consoles from Busboys..going for $90? are they nice? pratical?
how much do they interfere with getting to the back? do they just slide 
in or do you have to *gasp* drill? hehehe any info would be appreciate!
