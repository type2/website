Subject: Caravan vs. Vanagon (was: 100,000 mile tune-ups)


&gt;Not intending flame bait, but this van IS nice.  gobs of power.
&gt;quiet.  good mileage.  new.

Driving the V6anagon to work today, I was going up the usual medium hill,
that my old '71 maintained speed on but the V6anagon accelerates nicely
on. Noticed a Dodge Caravan (not Grand) in front, which the V6anagon was
not gaining on, tho turning 3000-3500 in 3rd. The Caravan verrrry slowly
pulled away. Yes, they do have nice power! The V6anagon &quot;mostly&quot; kept up,
which is what I like it so much for.

Course, the Caravan could have fit INSIDE the V6anagon...   ;-)
