Hello everyone,

The Moulton list I subscribe to also recently went from being a volunteer 
effort to one where money was required. Since the list was an unofficial 
offshoot of the Moulton Bicycle Club, and only about 150 people subscribed 
(some members, some not) the club couldn't justify the $100 a year it would 
take to have a host.

A usenet type list was discussed, but since not every server carries every 
usenet list, this was rejected because it would limit access.

Passing the hat was also discussed, but rejected because only a portion of 
those who subscribe would ante up. Since my business is primarily involved 
in importing and distributing Moultons to the US market, and I saw the list 
as a way to keep the lines of discussion open, I decided to pay the entire 
$100 as an advertising expense. While I &quot;own&quot; the list, I am not the 
administrator, nor do I try to control what is said (good or bad).

Maybe (and I mean this seriously even though it is Friday) VW AG, or VW USA 
might be approached about this? It would be a tiny expense, worth a lot in 
public relations, and give them a steady stream of (fanatical) feedback 
about the products. The only way this could work is if they don't 
administer the list, censor the postings, and they limit any commercial 
postings to a bare minimum.

Who knows, it might just work. If not VW, then maybe one of the after 
market companies who frequent the list would fund it.

And finally, since the list has been invaluable in my (perpetual) search 
for an EV, I too would kick in a few bucks for it's survival.
