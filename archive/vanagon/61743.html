Subject: Flat six for '84 Vanagon?
Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 10:38:49 -0600

Howdy,
I have had an 84 Vanagon for about two years now.  I have had two different
people tell me that a Porsche flat six will fit in the rear (one guy owned
such a monister).   Does anyone know if this can be done?   I am not ready
to do it at the moment, but if anything serious happened to my engine, this
might be an option.   I'm sick of being passed by everyone and not passing
anyone!   
In the meantime does anyone have any bolt-on performance suggestions for
the 1.9L.
Will a 5-speed tranny bolt up to this engine?
Thanks,
Kip
