Subject: 85 tranny/MN shops?
Date: Fri, 29 Nov 1996 13:48:12 

Hello everybody - this is Jim Hall ex-Listmember of Delaware and now moved 
to Minnesota about 1 month ago. My 85 Westy Wknr. 4-speed ran fine to get 
me the 1500+ miles to get here but the transmission and /or clutch failed 
me on Thanksgiving Day. First I noticed it shifting rather reluctantly &amp; 
wrote it off to not being driven for a few days &amp; sitting in the cold 
outside - then had trouble getting it in/out of gear at all. Seems like the 
engine will not disengage from the trans. fully - (start it up w/ clutch 
ALL the way in and it lurches forward)        Bad scene. 

So now I'd like to find out about some reputable shops in the Twin Cities 
Area for diagnosis/repair- I live in NE Minneapolis and know of the 
Volkswagen Man on Hennepin Ave. and the VW Clinic on Central Ave - any 
experience w/ those places or recommendations of anywhere else?
I've got AAA Plus for towing so that shouldn't be too much of a hassle.
ALSO - I guess I should put out feelers for a replacement 4speed 
transmission for an 85 as well. 
I'm NOT back on the list yet and borrowing my roommates account so PLEASE 
REPLY TO -----------   kenne031_at_maroon.tc.umn_dot_edu

I called G.Skerbitz _at_ home this AM and left a message on his machine - I'm 
sure he can be of some help but I figured I'd reach out to all of you fine 
folks as well. I'll try to keep checking the Listserve Gopher as well for 
stray messages. THANKS SO MUCH IN ADVANCE - Jim Hall
