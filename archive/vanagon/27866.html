&gt;&gt;&gt;19,100cc's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     WOW!!!!!!!              I WANT ONE OF
&gt;&gt;&gt;THOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you imagine how fast the Westy would go with 
this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Not very. The crankshaft would stand still, and the Westy would spin over
&gt;&gt;and over very quickly.   :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Reminds me of some of my mispent youth reading my dad's old Mechanix
&gt;Illustrated magazines.  I remember articles about people installing surplus
&gt;WWII airplane engines in various vehicles.  I think these were immense
&gt;Allison engines, but I could be mistaken.  Its been over twenty five years
&gt;since we threw these out. :(

I have heard that one of the training lessons given to fledgling pilots
of the P-51 Mustang fighter plane in WWII, was to have them take the plane
up to about 15,000 ft altitude (where there was nothing large and solid to
plow into), lower the landing gear and flaps, slow the plane way down to
where it could barely keep flying.

Then they would have the pilot slam the throttle all the way forward, so
the 14-cyl Merlin engine would suddenly produce its entire 1400 horsepower,
and try to channel it into accelerating that big propellor on the front.

The Mustang would roll over like a dead fish, and nothing the pilot could
do with the controls would stop it, until it got up enough speed for the
wings to grip the air sufficiently. Some pilots would roll all the way
around two or three times, unless they had the presence of mind to back
off on the throttle.


VW content? Well... you can try this in a VW, with relative safety. Unless
it had that 19,100cc engine the other guy described in his Westy.  :^)
