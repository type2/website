Bob, I'll keep my eyes and ears open. I'll pay especially good attention on
the way to buy a fire extinguisher to keep in my '71.

Solemnly,
Joe

&gt;
&gt;A moment of silence please for my good friend's recently departed 1970
&gt;Bus.  Owned for 13 years, 250K miles.  A victim of the dreaded fuel line
&gt;/ carb juncture failure.  The victim has been cremated.  I lieu of
&gt;flowers, the family is asking for leads on a '68 - '71 Bus with minimal
&gt;rust.  Thankyou. :-(
