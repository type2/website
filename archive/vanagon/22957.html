Bradley,

A big Waytago! on the 3/4&quot; socket set but the $15 tap &amp; die set is a disaster
waiting to happen.  I found the taps left a ragged, over-size hole with torn
thread due to the uneven finish,  and I stripped the teeth off an 8mm die,
the failure apparently due to improper heat treating.  Each of these failures
necessitated heroic measures to fix the problem produced by the bad tools.
 Threw them out and called myself several deserved kinds of fool -- cheap
tools are an expensive trap to get out of.  

I usually buy tools as I need them rather than in sets but was woed by the
price -- I needed a size that was in the kit and the whole kit wasn't much
more than I would have to pay for the individual tap and die for that size,
plus I'd have to drive over to a supply house to pick them up.

I keep my taps in a little tackle box, along with a couple of old
tooth-brushes.  If you keep them clean and use cutting oil when indicated, a
good tap will last a surprisingly long time.


Tap Joke:

An old machinist comes into the hiring hall of a big aerospace company in El
Segundo, fills out the forms, gives them to the girl.  &quot;We're not hiring
right now,&quot; bored, puts the papers on a pile, pushes her glasses up on her
nose with a finger.  He whips off the glasses, pulls a little pair of
needle-nose pliers out of his picket, adjusts the specs.  &quot;There.  Try them
now.&quot;  They fit perfectly and the girl, feeling sort of guilty, passes the
papers to her supervisor.  He reads the old man's resume and it's a good one
but he shakes his head, &quot;I'll keep this here with the short list but the
truth is, we're laying off people right now.&quot;  He shows the old machinist out
of his office.  Going out the door, the machinist notices the latch plate is
loose, whips out a screwdriver,  removes the screws, shims them with a
match-stick and resets the latch plate, all while the supervisor is watching,
amazed.  &quot;Just a minute...&quot;  the supervisor gets the old man's papers from
the desk and takes him upstairs to the department heads office.  The
department head is no kid and he and the machinist chat for a while but
finally he says &quot;I can see you're one of the good ones but the company has
this policy about not hiring anyone over fifty.  And that came straight from
the front office.&quot;  He shows the old machinist out and as they're shaking
hands the machinist says &quot;Seems a shame.  I've been a machinist all my life
and now I can't even find a job.&quot;  He sighs, turns to go, shakes his head.
 &quot;Fifty years a machinist and I never so much as broke a tap.&quot;  The head of
the company happened to be passing by just then, stops, yells at the head of
the department &quot;Well don't just stand there!  Find him a parking slot,&quot; sez
to the machinist: &quot;Howabout $50,000 a year to start?  

(Hint:  It be a lot funnier to you after you've busted a few.)

And for the list,  Harbor Freight's lastest catalog lists spot-weld cutters
for $5, about half what I've been paying (Item#  32943-0AHA).  They also now
have Insta-Foam's 'Spray n' Fill' urethane spray-foam kit for $20.  This is
the trick stuff for insulating a bug or bus. (Item# 31951-1AHA)
