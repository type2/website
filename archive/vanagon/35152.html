&gt;If I am not mistaken, there is a newish type of fire extinguisher which 
&gt;basically depletes the oxygen from the air around a fire.  I saw one of 
&gt;these a few years and it was demonstrated on common household fires and 
&gt;the big advantage that was touted at the time was that there was no mess 
&gt;to clean up afterwards.  Anyone on the list know more about this stuff?  
&gt;If not, and if anyone is interested I would imagine your local fire 
&gt;department would probably know what the stuff is and if it works.  
&gt;FWIW,

&gt;BTW one of the big dangers was that you did NOT want to use it in a 
&gt;closed area because of the obvious consequences of oxygen deprivation on 
&gt;humans...

Basic theory of HALON.  Stil not rated for class A fires except in very large
quantities. I'll say it again,  see local fire house for up to date and
accurate information.
