Hi Rod,

Mark Upton in Cuyahoga Falls, OH sells an very close duplicate of these for
around $5. I don't have his address handy but you should be able to find it
by searching in the archives under &quot;cupholder&quot; and me as the author. I'm
pretty sure I've posted this info before. Oh, he also advertises in the
LiMBO newsletter.

&gt; I have a '93 Eurovan MV which has a couple of broken cupholders($30/each
&gt; _at_ dealer). I believe they are the same ones that are in the later
&gt; Vanagon MV. They are square with the &quot;cover&quot; folding down to become the
&gt; base and a plastic ring folding up to hold the cup. I don't see a VW
&gt; part # on them. I've been told one can buy the exact same thing at
&gt; WalMart or PepBoys for about $9. The only thing I found at WalMart was a
&gt; $3 cheap black plastic cup holder that resembles it but it won't last a
&gt; week. Anyone seen these?
