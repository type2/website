Subject: Re: Oh ohh, tires

Hi Barry.  I am really happy with Yokohama Y370 LT 195 75/R14.  These 
tires are all season, excellent in ALL conditions, quiet, and make 
the Westy handle like a dream.  They can hold 1710 lbs at 65 psi.  
I'm on my second set of these tires, and think very highly of them.  
They aren't cheap, but they are worth every cent.  I believe we paid 
about $500 installed/balanced/evirnoment tax/valve stems/pst/gst. 

Hope this helps,
Harry.

&gt; So what does the list have to say. Should I go the light truck tire route 
&gt; or something else?
&gt; 
&gt; Barry!
&gt; 
&gt; So the question si...  just whatr
