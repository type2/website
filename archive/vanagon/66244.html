Subject:        Re: Vanagon- Chev 2.8 V6 swap

talk to KEP, I just got a 2.8 liter chevy kit from them.
they will send a flywheel and if you order it, a heavier duty clutch and a
higher torque starter.

Thanks Sudhir for writing me back.
I'm not familiar with KEP,more info on them would be appreciated.
I also didn't mention that I am using autotransaxle in my Vanagon.
I don't think this should be a problem though.
Thanks for your help.
