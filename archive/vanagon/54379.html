Subject: Re:Vanagon stumbling-wiring harness air-flow meter?	



&gt; I own a 85 GL Vanagon with a digijet engine, I also had the same problem.
&gt;What I am interested in knowing is the weather conditions during these
&gt;digijet stutterings. I live in Wisconsin, and have noticed when mildly cold
&gt;20-40 degrees and wet (snow or rain) my problems would occur.

Scott, Thanks for the reply, on a trip out west the stumbling ocurr at cold
temps 20-40 but the other on Dec.26 it was 55-60 in TN.So temp. don't seem
to be a factor.No rain that day either, but humidity was high.

&gt;wiring harness for your airflow meter that costs $150 that will solve your
&gt;problem, I found a way around this harness that cost me 41 cents. After
&gt;cleaning all of my grounds, I also replaced the ground on the fuel pump and
&gt;ran a fresh ground from the ECU. If you are intersested in the airflow
&gt;meter fix let me know and I will email the info to you. It has to do with
&gt;stablizing the electrical flow between pin 2 and 4 on the airflow meter
&gt;connector with a capacitor. This current can become erratic with age.

Yes I have read about this wiring harness, but I also read it seem to only
applies to 86-90's vanagon with digifant injection not digijet.(?) (Anyone
on the list like to enlighten us on that?)But yes Scott, send me this
information about the installation of the capacitor,I'll do a little
soldering and wiring harness modification to keep from giving VW $150.00,
for something they should replaced for free.(Dam Germans)
