&gt; Can you imagine all of us bringin' in all this fish past the park
&gt; entrance?  Whew!  Hopefully most of us will buy this fish closer
&gt; to the park.  I can't imagine buying fish in Sacramento (and you
&gt; can forget about it being fresh there) and hauling it all the way
&gt; to Pfeiffer Big Sur?  ;p
 
Don't forget, it's by the sea.  So I would think that there is a good fish 
market around there somewhere.
