Subject: vanagon AC

OK, folks, here's one:

I'm not sure if it's just that the EV AC is too strong, or that my Vanagon's
AC needs to be re-charged.  Before I mortgage my house and take the Vanagon to
the dealer, are there any things I can do myself? Like trying to recharge the
AC myself and see if it gets better?  I had done this years ago on a Renault 18
and it was not hard at all.   Is it possible to do the same on the Vanagon?

Any ideas, opinions appreciated...
