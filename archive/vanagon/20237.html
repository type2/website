Subject: Midwest Gathering

By coincidence, Gerry Skerbitz &amp; I have just been talking about the
possibility of, next year, trying to have some sort of gathering here in
south-central Iowa.

Before you start screaming, southern Iowa is quite pretty--plenty of short,
steep grades to challenge those of us with the old upright engines, even.
Anyway, the first week of August every year, Indianola, Iowa (between Des
Moines and the Missouri line) hosts the National Hot-Air Balloon
Championships, and it's really a lot of fun.  There's a nice state park 6
mi. south of Indianola, and the town is 20+ miles east of Winterset and the
famed Bridges of Madison County.  There is also a good state park (Pammel)
near Winterset.

I've already talked to the folks at Lake Ahquabi (the park nr. Indianola)
who thought that there might be room if we scheduled for the end of balloon
week.
They were more than a little amused at the prospect of a bunch of weirdos in
VW Busses invading the park.  (&quot;You mean you guys just drive those
cracker-boxes around for the hell of it?&quot; &lt;gesture to Frau B.&gt;)  :)

Think about it.
