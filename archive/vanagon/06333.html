Volks,

My life has gotten too hectic, at least for the time being, to even have
the time to sort through all of the vanagon mail, let alone read it,
so I must bid you farewell for now. I think I'll probably be back within
a few months once I get things outside of the computer (yes, there is
a life out there) sorted out a little better.  (Yeah, I'll come back....
They always come back....)

Thanks for the help in diagnosing problems with Ms. Pickle.  She now has
her second new clutch in 4000 mi. (hopefully they did it right this time--
it was covered under warranty.)  This was after I got to (yay!) try the
driving-with-no-clutch-and-using-the-starter-at-stop-signs trick.

I also, incidentally, proved to myself that I can indeed handle things
mechanical by replacing the gear selection cross in my Vespa.  This required
splitting the transmission/engine case, pulling all four gears, replacing
the cross, and putting everything together (in the right orientation and
with no leftover parts!)  I don't think I'm ready for transmission work
on the bus, but at least I figure I can handle some more minor things.

David, Martha, etc. Please keep me informed about GNATT (that's the
Great North American Transporter Trek, as suggested by someone else)
and GNATT-West.

So long and thanks for all the fish!

-Patrick
