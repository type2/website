Subject: New listprocessor

This is a rather trepid announcement of my installation of the 
listprocessor software.

The list is still called vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu, but you can send 
help,subscribe,unsubscribe,set vanagon digest messages to 
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

As soon as I get a welcome message together, I'll post it to the list 
so you can forward it to your friends.

If there are any problems, I'll probably see them, but please send mail 
to me as gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu if you see them first or you need some 
help with something.

Also, if you can spare a few seconds to quickly respond to this note so I 
know it got out there somewhere, that'd be nice (I can do that while the 
list is still small. &lt;smile&gt;)

Thanks,

--
