Subject: wanted bus w/ no motor

I am in need of a bus pre-'71 preferably, so as I can put Natasha's (my dead
'71 Kombi) heart and soul into it. I live in the Southern Illinois area.
Carbondale to be exact. If anyone knows anyone with what I need please pass
it on.

'71 Kombi (180,000) Presently Paralyzed due to serious frame rot
'81 Honda Prelude (230,000) Needs water pump
'81 Suzuki GS750 (75,000) This one runs.But if it's raining I can't go

&quot;The bus came by and I got on that's when it all began...&quot;
