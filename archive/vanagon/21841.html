Subject: 96 bus trip to the arctic ocean.


&gt; i used to live up in the yukon territory, and the availability of parts in
&gt; whitehorse is not good. there aren't any. everything is ordered in from
&gt; edmonton or vancouver at astonishing prices (i had a landcruiser instead of a
&gt; bus up there, and there was a reason for it...). as far as our
&gt; proposed trip goes, the last places that have vw parts are prince
&gt; george, b.c., and edmonton, alberta. and of course anchorage, but
&gt; that would be out of our way...needless to say, there's no veedub dealers on
&gt; the 2000 miles between edmonton and anchorage. there's one guy in whitehorse
&gt; who will work on vw's if pushed hard enough (with those colorful canadian
&gt; bills !). he's the local &quot;foreign cars specialist&quot;, calls himself a
&gt; mechanic... the town has 2-3 fairly well stocked FLAPS for general things,
&gt; and being a frontier city in mining country, there's no shortage of welders
&gt; and other people who will say they can fix anything. a fair number of 'em
&gt; probably can... there's about half a dozen pretty trashed buses around town,
&gt; and once in a while you can find one as engine donor if you need one. the
&gt; junkyards have, like, 2 buses and half a dozen rabbits. as far as busses go,
&gt; the yukon is a developing country...
&gt;                     ciao,

&gt; Proposal!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Go for it. Were the temperatures about what you planned for? What would
&gt; &gt; you say the availability of mid-70s Volkswagen parts was for most of the
&gt; &gt; trip..?   : ' )

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Folks.  My wife &amp; I did a similar trip in 1989 as to what Tobin is
&gt; &gt; &gt; proposing.  We did this trip in 5 weeks, and covered 10,500 km of
&gt; &gt; &gt; which over 8,000 km were dirt/gravel/shale.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be more than happy to share my experiences with anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking of this trip.
