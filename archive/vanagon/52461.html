Subject: 12v Air Compressors

In the last couple of weeks, there has been a discussion about 12v 
air compressors.  Seems like we have all used the cheap ones and 
realize how slow they are and how they tend to overheat.  Someone even 
mentioned that all the 12v air compressors they had seen used the same 
motor. Today, I found a unit at a local store (Quality Farm &amp; Fleet) 
that has a larger motor and is much faster.

The air compressor is a heavy duty 12v truck air compressor by AC-Delco 
(Model #CAD-275) with a 7 year warranty. It is not cheap at $49.99 but 
is a solid piece of equipment.  It is about the same size as the larger 
12v air compressors you see at wal-mart, k-mart, etc.  Specifications 
on the box indicated it would fill a 9.50x16.5 tire in 5 1/2 minutes. 
It also has a longer power cord which would make it easier to reach the 
back tires. Below are specifications from the box comparing this unit 
to the normal units we see everywhere. 
 
			AC-Delco	Normal units
Motor Diameter		2.04 inches	1.4 inches
Air Flow  		47 CFM		28 CFM
Max operating Temp	165 degrees	350 degrees
Non stop performance	8 hours		30 minutes
Electric cord		13 1/2 feet	10-12 feet

Hope this information helps anyone looking for a 12v air compressor.
