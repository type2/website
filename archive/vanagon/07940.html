&gt;     (Sorry, folks, forgot to mention the year of the van, although they
&gt;     may be interchangeable on some of the older model vans! TZ)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     The Westphalia type that lifts in the middle and pivots at the front
&gt;     of the bus into a &gt;, not the kind that pops up level.
&gt;
&gt;     It's in good condition, with a few torn sections in the tent, but the
&gt;     screens, hardware, exterior finish and gaskets are in very good
&gt;     condition.
&gt;
&gt;     This particular top cannot be bought new anymore, and to find a good
&gt;     used one is very difficult. (I know! I had to pay over $700 to get a
&gt;     used replacement top for a van I had a few years ago that lost its top
&gt;     in a severe windstorm.)
&gt;
&gt;     If any interest, home is 281-3690, or after 12-20-94, 284-2809. Work
&gt;     is 622-5481, ext 534 or aspect 534, or e-mail me back for particulars.
&gt;
&gt;     Asking $420 or best offer.
