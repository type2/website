Hi folks,

I realize a big problem on older busses is increased resistance in the 
(loooong) ignition wires, but another common starting problem is 
independent of the resistance problem.

If your solenoid itself is shot, your bus won't start.  How to tell?  
Short across the terminals between the live wire from the battery and the 
starter motor: starter motor whirs, sounds ok?  Good. 
Short directly across the terminals for the live wire and the solenoid: 
nothing?  Then it's the solenoid.  Replace it.

Oh, you'll want to do the above with the bus in neutral!  =:O

It's no big deal to replace the starter solenoid with a new or rebuilt 
one.  Really.  Took me 1 1/2 hours and I worked slow, cleaning everything 
meticulously.  You could probably do it faster, even if this is your 
first VW repair.  Really.

One problem might be finding somewhere that will sell you just the 
solenoid, rather than the whole starter/solenoid unit.  Big difference in 
price, although it's even easier to replace everything in one shot.  
Whine and grovel until they source a solenoid for you.  Bow WOW parts in 
Vancouver found me one for 30 BUCKS CANADIAN.  Solenoid replacement is a 
cheap repair, kids!

Oh, and don't forget to clean up the connections, crimp 'em a bit so they 
stick better, and so forth.  It can't hurt, and will probably help.
