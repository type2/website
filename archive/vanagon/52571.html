Subject: Re: Have you replaced the Receiver/Drier in your A/C?

&gt;FYI, this receiver drier was replaced in June this summer.
Where was the drier purchased from? If it happened to be a VW dealer there
is a 12 month warranty for parts sold over the counter. Seepage from this
plug is a fault of the part. As you mentioned, the normal failure of this
plug is blow out when pressures exceed the plug's rating.
