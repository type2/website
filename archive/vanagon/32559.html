&gt;&gt;OR - a la Bob Hoover, crush the beans with a hammer, rock,  and stir the
&gt;&gt;coffee with a wrench!
&gt;
&gt;

It was not a 'wrench' it was a three-eights-drive flex-handle, recently wiped
down with WD-40 and an old sock.

======  

I stand corrected.  I recall the knurled handle end of it, but couldn't
remember the other end for sure.

Just to ensure some VW content - all you diesel folk out there:  I have been
running redline diesel fuel addative at about 1 oz/10 gal and it seems to have
cured a leaky seal problem in my injection pum (between the pump main casting
and the end plate where the high pressure fuel lines attach ).  This is AFTER 
I had the pump re-done because of the change in CA fuel a few years ago.
