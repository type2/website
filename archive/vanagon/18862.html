Subject: Re: 74 valve clearance?

&gt;i have been adjusting my own valves since i bought
&gt;my bus in november and have not had any problems

What clearances have you been using that work so well?


&gt;and for newer models set them all to .006, even if the
&gt;sticker says .004 because you would rather have them
&gt;loose than burn a valve seat.

Yep. Good idea to go looser than tighter.


&gt;the problem is that my sticker on my engine says
&gt;.008 for exhaust and .006 for intake or vice versa
&gt;should i just set them all to .006 or follow the sticker,

I would suggest that you use the clearances specified
on the engine sticker.  Use .008 for exhaust and .006
for intake.  If I remember, that's the clearances I used
on my original '73 stock motor (1.7L, dual carbs).

Of course, take this with a grain of salt because I have
recently installed a 1978 F.I. motor in my bus.  Valve
adjustments are a thing of the past with the hydraulic
lifters in my new motor.
