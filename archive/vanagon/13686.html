So Jon Van Wyk says:
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine keeps breaking the flue vent cover of his westy.  VW gets
&gt; something like $20 for these, as I'm told.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a cheaper source?
&gt; 
&gt; What do most folks do?  Just don't bother?
&gt; 
&gt; My friend works in plastics molding and has thought of making a flue vent
&gt; mold.  If he did, would his vents be a marketable item at, say, $10?
&gt; 

May I first suggest that if you have future questions, that you be sure
to read the FAQ's for vanagons.  Sources for this are:
