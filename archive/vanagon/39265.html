&gt; &gt;with a VW Bus welded on top?  What show did you see that at?
&gt; 
There is one that comes every year to the Tennessee-Alabama-Georgia 
Spelunking get-togethers, also known as &quot;Cave In's&quot;.  These cave-in's are 
held in May and October of every year.   The bus/bus hybrid is your 
standard 60's vintage school bus with a Split Window welded to the top.  
With the partridge family-esque paint job, it looks like it would fit right
in at any neo-woodstock type gathering.  Maybe some day, I'll dig out the 
photo album and scan a photograph of it.  Quite a sight....
