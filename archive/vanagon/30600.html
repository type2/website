Subject: RE: Clutchless in California


&gt;Got a phone call from dealer's shop about the van just now.  Aside from no
&gt;power at the shop due to the storm, they believe that something in the 
clutch
&gt;broke, and have to drop the tranny to &quot;look and see&quot;.  Current estimate is
&gt;$360 to Remove and Replace, possibly another  $290 parts for clutch and 
stuff.


Dealer prices? Ouch. Call around a LOT, especially to small aftermarket
parts places. I bought clutch parts for an '80 Vanagon a few months ago.
Got prices around $200-250 from several places for all four pieces (disc,
plate, T/O bearing, Pilot bearing, and then found them at World Parts
Depot (619) 275-4240 here in San Diego, for $115. All German parts, from
Sachs. I didn't bother asking VW dealers for prices. Of course, I don't
know if this clutch will suit your application-- what year is your van?
