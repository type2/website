Subject: VW Bug and Bus heaven.....

I was away on a business trip to New Mexico recently and found what 
could only be described as a bug and bus heaven.  Seems they had on of 
everything and several splitties and single and dual cab busses.  I will 
be headed back down that way in april and may.  Any of you Northern 
californians need parts just let me know and I'll dig through the piles. 
 Most of the bugs/busses seem to be in really good shape.  very little 
rust was evident, but alot of broken glass.  Drop me an email if you 
need anything.
