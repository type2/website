                               MY OPINION   
                              -------------
                                  

     &quot;I would rather be pushed by a Vanagon than pulled by a Caravan&quot;
       

                       Someone made the comment


        &quot;Driving a Vanagon is like riding at the point of a spear&quot; 


                               I AGREE


PaulC
&quot;Not quite so Vanagon-less in Connecticut&quot;
