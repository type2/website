Subject: A good use for the silver socket

Vanagonians,

I had one of those silver sockets bolted by the steering column.
I never used it, PO must of used it for a radar detector. So my
plan is to drill a hole in the cabinet back by the engine lid and 
mount the silver socket there. This way I'll be able to plug in 
a hand held 12V lamp and use it to peer into the engine compartment. 
Should be handy. I'm just not sure were I should take power from, 
I guess I'll have to run a wire all the way up to the fuse block, 
any ideas?

I also plan to mount a goose neck reading lamp on the overhead 
shelf by the AC unit, similiar problem of running the wire up to 
the fuse block.

TIA,
