Subject: Re: FUKENGRUVEN!

To add to the growing list of these, I saw a tee-shirt with a Mr. Bubblehead
sitting on the john, kinda dejected -- &quot;Farfrompoopin&quot;...

&gt; &gt;My '80 Westy had this &quot;Fukengruven&quot; bumper sticker - just like the
&gt; &gt;Fahrvergnugen slogan, complete with the stick figure, on the pop-top when I
&gt; &gt;bought it last year.  As my 5 year old daughter began to learn to read, i
&gt; &gt;took it off!  Now that she's a worldly 6-year old, i wish still had it. Can
&gt; &gt;anyone out there tell me where to find one, or does anyone have an extra to
&gt; &gt;sell?
&gt; 
&gt; I saw a new one the other day... 'Fukenstroken' with the stick figure
&gt; experiencing self-pleasure :-).&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I was at a Volkswagon show this past weekend and they had stickers that read
&gt; &quot;Fukenbroken&quot; with a figure holding a wrench.
