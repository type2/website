Subject: Auxiliary batteries

&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;
&gt;I never found a size 41 deep-cycle, So I gave up. I did find a deep cycle 
&gt;tractor/smowmobile battery that was tall but narrow. So I installed in 
&gt;next to the water tank, low. I had to move the partition only about an 
&gt;inch, so I lost virtually no storage space. It's a 60 amp hour battery.

Good to hear from you again Dave. You are one of the people I like most
about the Vanagon list. 

Cool spot for the 2nd battery. I too discovered that the space behind the
110 volt electrical outlets was not being used for anything productive so I
moved the wall between that empty cavity to make it a little smaller. 

Now, I store a spare brain, fuel pump, idle stabailization valve, o2 sensor,
etc. etc. etc. there. These are all parts from my 87 syncro camper that hit
a deer. Nice on trips to have spares of every FI part, eh?

Anyway, I modified the battery compartment behind the driver so that the
battery could stick up an extra couple of inches in height and yet I could
still swivel the drivers seat around. Now, I find that I can fit a group 78
size marine deep cycle battery in that spot. This is rather a big battery as
it takes up the entire space and sticks up about 1 to 2 inches taller than
the cavity. I have disguised it with rug material. 

I was hoping to find a group 41 battery for that space so it would n't stick
up at all, but I can still use the larger group 78 size which I now plan to
do upon multiple confirmations that there is nada deep cycle 41s, or as some
cool cat on the list brought to our attention this week, slightly larger 42s.. 

By the way, Dave, I have been sort of fantasizing that I would give you my
credit card number and that you would use it to send me all the parts I
would need to replicate your setup to route coolent through the drinking
water tank. I went to the pics of your stuff at the Web site and it looked
really cool. The only thing keeping me from doing this myself right now is
inertia.

I'll remark on one other cool cool thing I with that compartment behind the
110 volt outlets: I moved the circuit breaker reset button back out of the
way and installed a 2nd set of 110 volt outlet plugs. Now I have four 100
volt outlets instead of just two, and I can reset the circuit breaker by
reaching into the little closet down there.
