Hmmm.  You should have gotten the &quot;Children's encyclopedia&quot; set at the

OH, uhhhhh.  Bus commentary.  I've taken the newly re-headed bus on the 
first medium length trip (200 miles) in the mid-day FL sun (95o) and it 
worked like a champ. 55-60 most of the way, heat never went up once.  I 
was very proud.  This included the couple of sudden out of nowhere 
towns, where I was stoppped at a red light for no good reason.
