&gt;&gt; Hi, I work with the Stebro Exhausts company and we noticed a

&gt;&gt; thinking about tooling up to produce Vanagon systems (manifold
&gt;&gt; pipes &amp; mufflers) in stainless steel. If - there is demand and it

Jean,

I saw the original post but have since discarded it.  Since it
came up on the vanagon_at_lenti list with a response from Eric Zeno,
I'm passing along another opinion.

Good quality exhaust would be a godsend to most Vanagon owners,
particularly the wasserboxer owners.  Replacement parts from VW,
IMO, are better quality than aftermarket stuff from other
manufacturers, but the prices are also considerably higher.  I
have owned my '84 for 12 years and replaced the original system
with VW parts and with aftermarket stuff.  The potential buyers
on vanagon_at_lenti are generally those who would buy stainless if
they can afford it.  Stainless exhaust is the best way to go and
if the price were similar to stock VW (eventhough higher than
other aftermarket) it would be good competition for VWAG.

Marketing stainless for Vanagons would not be a problem if all
Vanagaon owners were on vanagon_at_lenti.  Unfortunately, they are
not.  Supplying your stainless systems through other *known* VW
retailers may make sense, if Stebro doesn't already have a policy
against that approach.  The names of those retailers appear on
vanagon_at_lenti on a regular basis, so it's not hard to figure out
who they are in the U.S.  Entering the European market (if you're
not already there) would considerably increase the possibilities
of making a proffit on the tooling and manufacturing.

If additional &quot;yes&quot; votes can help you make a case, you have
mine.  And while you're at it, don't forget to make the tube
&quot;brackets&quot; out of stainless too.
