&lt;&lt; Hello Vagonlist, I have been preparing for a trip from B'ham Alabama to my
 brothers, 50 mile west of Reno. I will be using my 1985 Westy to pull a
 trailer hauling my 700lb-1985 BMW Motorcycle. (Hope the bus can do it!) &gt;&gt;

I have towed 2 seadoos on a trailer for over 4000 miles behind my westy
without a problem(a little slow up the Baker, Ca. grades w/ a/c in
August...but...) You should have no trouble with the bike trailer.Sounds like
a great trip.Good Luck and have fun.Check out the Hi Tech Companies in
Portland on your way up to Seattle( they need people desperately here and its
cheaper than Sea).
