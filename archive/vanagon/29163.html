Subject: Electric/mount fan motor question

exuse this if this becomes a repost, but i sent two different messages after i
sent this one and saw the other two but never this one.

&gt;hi everyone, i have two questions.  
&gt;
&gt;ATTATCHING:
&gt;	i have a fan motor, a piece of plastic the fan attatches to,
&gt;and the two ducts that attatch to this piece of plastic.  what is a
&gt;good way to attatch it to the top of the engine compartment?  what
&gt;kind of grease/oil should i lube it with.  i am going to clean it up
&gt;of dirt and rust and paint and lube it.
&gt;
&gt;ELECTRICAL QUESTION:)
&gt;	i was testing my new heater fan last night and have some
&gt;questions about how it hooked up so the switch works up front.  my
&gt;basic setup from what i can tell from when there was a heater motor is
&gt;the following.  there is a little circuit drawn below that i think
&gt;acts to complete the connection up front.  (this is the picture
&gt;printed on the box, and this is how i believe it should be hooked up? 
&gt;
&gt;30 - the wire from the front of the bus (which i believe is a ground
&gt;     wire that is &quot;grounded&quot; when the lever is pulled).
&gt;87 - ground to the fan motor
&gt;85 - a wire directly from the battery, there is a fuse in this wire.
&gt;86 - power to the fan motor.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	           /
&gt;	__________/ _______
&gt;	|   	   	  |	i believe the box in the middle 
&gt;	|       ___	  |	is battery/power and the switch
&gt;	|       | |	  |    	is the ground line?
&gt;	|  _____| |____	  |
&gt;	|  |    |_|   |	  |
&gt;	|  |          |	  |
&gt;	|  |	      |	  |
&gt;	0  0          0   0
&gt;       30  85        86   87
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i believe that when you throw the lever up front, you connect it to
&gt;ground, thus completeing the circuit and turning on the motor.  bit
&gt;when i hook it up this way, and touch the power from the fan motor to
&gt;#86, is all i get is a click sound out of the little box drawn above.
&gt;but i know that the wire from the battery is fine since i can hook the
&gt;fan directly up to a good ground it works.  the wire from the front is
&gt;OLD, and very thin and using a voltmeter i don't think the connection
&gt;is reliable.  i want to replace it, where do i get wire and what
&gt;gauge(?) do i need.  how could i just install aswitch instead of using
&gt;that lever, or is hooking it back up to the lever easy.  assumiong i
&gt;want a switch (since i want one for something else i am going to do)
&gt;how/where do i get one?
&gt;
&gt;just call me the electrical dunce:)
&gt;
&gt;thanks everyone for any advice you can pass my way.  take care all,
&gt;
