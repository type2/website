Subject: Re: Messed up Steering column

I just read Steve Johnson's story about his steering column.  He figures 
it got damaged by the way he entered the Van, pulling himself in with the 
aid of the steering wheel.  I got to thinking, how do I get into my van?  
Just went out and tried.  I open the door with the keys in my right hand 
and pull myself in with my left hand on the steering wheel.  I do not 
think that I have to worry though.  It's a '67 with half a million miles 
on it.  I could probably pull stumps with it.  GARY Gibson.
