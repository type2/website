&gt; Subject:        Head corrosion  A shop here in Seattle, Connecting Rod Inc. (I think
&gt; that is the name)claims that they do this on all their rebuilt enginges with success.  Has anyone
&gt; out there had any experience with them??  Long term, did this help??

This was in reference to a 1.9 wasserboxer.  I have heard mixed things 
about this shop,  so I didn't chose them.  Could be just sales hype.
