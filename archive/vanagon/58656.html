Subject: fair mkt value on syncro

hey folks

  Just wondering what the &quot;fair market value&quot; would be on my 87 syncro GL.
 Alloys, air, 60k miles, spotless interior, it had a clean exterior until
yesterday when i got hit.  I just want to be prepared for the insurance co's
screwing.

Thanks a bunch

-to everyone that requested parts,  i will go look at the vans on tuesday as
originally planned. (in a rental car)
