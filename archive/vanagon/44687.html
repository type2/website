Subject: RE: 84 Inside Mirror Removal?


&gt;What's the trick to removing and installing the inside mirror on an 84
&gt;Vanagon?  Short of busting it out, I have not had success in getting it
&gt;out and the Bentley's does not mention it.  Any feedback is welcome, 
thanks.

In the '80 V6anagon, I gave the mirror stem a strong twist, it turned
about 90 degrees, and then came out easily. Putting in the replacement
was (approximately) the reverse of removal, tho I had to jockey it in
past a metal ridge in the roof.

Anyone know if the post's '84, has the inside center mirror mounted
the same way as in an '80?
