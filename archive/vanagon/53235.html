Subject: Subject: LA Vanagon Westy's for rent?

In reply to Fred Dyen's message:

&gt; My brother-in-law and his wife are planning a trip to the desert.  They
&gt; plan on flying into Los Angeles and are wondering if there are any places
&gt; that rent Westfalias or Eurovan campers the the L.A. area.  Can anybody
&gt; give me a heads up on this.

They should call an outfit called &quot;Adventure Werks&quot;.  They operate a fleet
of rentable Westies (both busses and Vanagons, and perhaps Eurovans) in
Washington state in the summer; in the winter most of the fleet migrates
south to Arizona.  As I recall, they used to operate out of L. A. in the
winter but no longer do so; however, it's worth checking with them.  When I
spoke with them (about a year ago) they very nearly convinced me to fly to
Phoenix.  It's a quick, reasonably inexpensive flight from L. A.  Perhaps
something like that would work for your brother-in-law and his wife.

Their number is:  (800) 736-8897 [= &quot;(800) RENT VWS&quot;] This information may
not still be current, but give it a try.  While I didn't end up renting
from them (I caved in and bought my own Westy, which is what I really
wanted) they seemed like a very good bunch.
