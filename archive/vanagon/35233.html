&gt;There were two types of Eberspacher BN4 heaters, the 1971 and earlier model
&gt;and the 72-up.  The earlier model uses a diaphram pump while the later style
&gt;uses an in-line metering pump. Make sure you really need a new fuel pump
&gt;before buying a new one.  Run the pump straight off the battery and see if
&gt;it vibrates/pumps. 

This is for the early models? The later ones need the fan motor spinning to 
pulse the pump. Set of points on one end of it power the pump. Tim Smith
