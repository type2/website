Subject: Re: Much Mail

I'm subscribed to V_at_L for a couple of months now and i found that Digest
mode is the thing, i get digests with about 50/60 posts at a time,
i browse through it, extract messages i wanna keep, read again or reply to,
and thats it, you only have to open one message and whatever mailtool
your using, it looks still organized, other (work/private) messages will be
clearly visible, This list combines several interests to some, but for me
it's the VW-Bus in whole. It doesn't bother me that i receive some messages
later than other listmembers cause the majority comes in at night anyway :)
