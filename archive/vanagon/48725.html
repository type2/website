Fred asked:

&gt; Does anyone have a source for &quot;O-rings&quot; for the adjustable pushrods.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Any help would be appreciated.

I just installed three adjustable pushrod tubes on a friend's '84
a couple of weeks ago.  One of the O-rings got pinched in the
process and I was afraid it wouldn't seal until I recalled that I
could just go to a good hardware store, search through (in my
case) a little parts drawer thingie in the plumbing aisle and
find the right size to replace it.

I'll admit it may not be *exactly* the same size, but one a tad
smaller would stretch enough to be usable and would beat spending
another $40, when $.40 might do the trick.
