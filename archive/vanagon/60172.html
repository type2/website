Subject: (Fwd) Any horn pros?

&gt;Currently I am attemping to follow the wiring to make  sure it is 
&gt;wired up right.

Like Wendy suggested, before you go rewiring the horn, check the 
contacts at the horn itself and see if a multimeter will show 
current.  You may have to abrade the contacts a bit to get them to 
work.

At least on the Bug I used to have, the horn was right 
under the wheelwell and would naturally get sprayed with all kinds of 
road gook including salt water in the winter.  The contacts (and 
eventually the horn) corrode and the horn would first sound like a 
dying cow and then stop working.
