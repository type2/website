&gt;Yes the snow is two feet deep, and the Pioneer hadn't been out of her 
&gt;hidey-hole for some time, so I started her up (easy as ever), and 
&gt;took her out on the open road.
&gt;
&gt;The usual stutter as I floored it was less apparent than usual for a 
&gt;nice change.
&gt;
&gt;I drove to the corner, and took a left.  As I shifted down to second, 
&gt;I found myself in reverse, as the shifter tried to engage.  (I have 
&gt;no shifter guide plate, so there's no safety push-down to get into 
&gt;reverse.

 [story of not being able to shift gears deleted]

&gt;Got car to tow bus home later that night, and I thought it was 
&gt;probably the coupler from tranny to shifter.  Get down in the gravel 
&gt;and road dirt/salt/snow under the bus.
&gt;
&gt;Yep.  Screw in coupler is most the way out.  Anyhow, I only had some 
&gt;channel-locks, so I managed to screw it back in enough to get it to 
&gt;go into first gear.  I think it is about 90% stripped out.  It just 
&gt;kept turning though.
&gt;
&gt;Drove home in first.
&gt;
&gt;So the question:
&gt;
&gt;It looks fairly easy to replace it.  I imagine that I don't have to 
&gt;loosen the whole tranny.  Rather just shift into the gear which 
&gt;pushes the tranny half in the most, undo that, put the shifter in the 
&gt;gear that pulls the connector rod all the way forward, and undo and 
&gt;replace.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else done this?
&gt;
Mike, I'd recommend getting a couple of kits from RMMW.  The first is their
&quot;shifter kit&quot; or similar name.  It has everything for the &quot;front&quot; part of
the shifting mechanism, including gear shifter, spring, GUIDE PLATE, bushing,
knob, etc.  It's less than $30, closer to $20 if memory serves.  I've found
having an installed, adjusted guide plate to be a real boon.  ;-)

The second is their rear coupler kit, the rubber and metal pieces that
connect the shifter rod to the front of the transmission.  I think it's in
the $8-$11 range, and yeah it's pretty easy to install if things are about
the same between your bus and my '71.  Good luck.
