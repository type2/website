Subject: Re: Holes in Tires

&gt;All funnin' aside, I wonder if anyone has had a properly-inflated tire
&gt;have a sidewall blowout?

Yes, but still not a good example.  Back in '77, the Bozobus still had the
stock, tubed, Semprits on him. (Read: 16 year old tires)  The left front
blew just as I was hitting a freeway offramp.  Made it somewhat difficult
to steer.  No load inside at the time...
