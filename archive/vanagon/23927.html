Subject: Re: Syncro Upgrade

There is a Syncro in a salvage yard here.  I haven't seen it, but I hear 
that it is a candidate for rebuilding.  If anyone is interested, I'll 
find out more.

&gt; Upgrading a 2wd to Syncro Vanagon would not be an easy task.  There 
&gt; are many body differences underneath to take into account.  Even the 
&gt; fuel tank is a different shape and is in the rear above the 
&gt; transmission.  There are special frame modifications done at the 
&gt; factory for this conversion by VW, and front suspension is different 
&gt; as well.  Many components are either hard to come by or extremely 
&gt; expensive.  
&gt; 
&gt; In  a nutshell, if you want a Syncro, buy a Syncro.  A conversion 
&gt; would be a *major* financial and engineering feat.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone has done anything more than contemplate
&gt; &gt; upgrading an older Vanagon to 4wd by transplanting all the necessary
&gt; &gt; drivetrain components from a Syncro?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your comments.
