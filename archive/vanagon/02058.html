Subject: Re: Brake Drum Removing


----- Begin Included Message -----


I determined that loosening satr wheels was not necessary to pull the drum off.
A gear puller can have 2 up to 6 legs. A puller with 5 legs would be great but
mine has only 3. Screw wheel lug nuts back into the drum but not all the way
to the bottom. Position the puller with the center long screw against the
axle while have the hooks of all legs pulling the lug nuts. Now slowly turn
the center screw of the puller. You will see the legs in action of pulling the
drum off.

One note of warning, Many years ago, on my '65 Bus (Dixie, now demised), the
rough winters in Connecticut had rusted my star wheels into place, and the
drums were worn with ridges on the inside lips.  Lacking any other way to
remove the hubs, I resorted to a puller which slowly, but surely bent and
mangled everything on and attached to the brake shoes.  Luckily, I was
replacing the tranny with a complete assembly, so I didn't really care about
anything inside there except the end of the emergency brake cable.  The moral
of this story is, be very careful if using a puller without loosening the star
adjuster, as you may end up replacing more than just the shoes.
