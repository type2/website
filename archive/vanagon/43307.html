Subject: Intermittent Roughness Eliminated in 84 Vanagon

I have been experiencing intermittent roughness in my 84 Vanagon 
for the past several weeks. It turned out to be a broken 
connection at the full RPM throttle switch.  The wire was 
attached to a spade terminal that was part of the switch, but in 
contact with the breather hose.  This provided a good electrical 
connection most of the time.  It was only upon pulling the wires
to electrically check the switch that I discovered the problem.

In fact, during an earlier troubleshooting episode, I had decided
that the culpret was indeed the idle throttle switch and had 
attempted to locate one.  Interesting side note, the local dealer
here in Fairbanks quoted $82.52 for the switch, every other dealer
quoted $48.80 for the same switch, except for the folks in AZ -
they were $36.60 for list members. Since no one had the switch in 
stock, I thought I'd best take another look, so I drug out the 
multimeter and started checking circuits.

Hope this might help someone else.  What lead me to suspect the 
throttle switch, was that when the rough running occurred, I was
able to note that if I idled the car and then attempted to increase
the RPM to 2,000, the RPM would hunt.  First showed up when I 
attempted to have the vehicle IM tested. 

Later,

Fred
