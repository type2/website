Subject: Re: Bob....

Not to be a party pooper, but could Bob have walked there and back by now?

Must admit, I haven't followed the whole thread, but I'm tempted to just
get in the bus and drive to wherever Bob is and just take him wherever he
wants to go. Problem is, it would cost too much in oil right now 8(

Please set flamethrowers on stun. 8)
