Subject: Re: Neat Vanagon Sighting

reminds me of a german book that i was looking at that had some reimo (sp?)
stuff in it. fwiw reimo makes fantastic stuff at fantastic prices (read
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)

one of the pop top things that reimo manufactures is designed so that you
can remove the fibreglass pop top (the long part) from the top of the van,
flip it upside down and put it in a lake. they have a picture of a fellow
rowing around in it (the pop top that is!) I don't know how they get around
detaching the canvas &quot;tent&quot; that usually attaches to the pop top??

fwiw the book is written by manfred klee and is called ds vw bus buch. i
got mine from neato, fun to look at although i am not conversant in german!

any one else got this book?? i think i payed $18.00US.

&gt;  OFFICE MEMO          Neat Vanagon Sighting                  Date:6/23/95
&gt;
&gt;On tuesday I was walking to to grocery store and saw an interesting van in the
&gt;parking lot. It had a high fixed roof, like an upside boat on it. Sounds like
&gt;the descriptions of dave schwartz's boat, except this was a vanagon. I walked
&gt;up to take a close lookand it was an adventurewagon. I know someone on the
&gt;list has an 81 adventurewagon, but this is the first time I've seen one. Huge
&gt;high roof, foldout bed up above. no side cabinets, so the rear seat was full
&gt;width, but it had a cabinet behind each front seat, one was a
&gt;sink/refrigerator, and the other a stove. behind the back seat was a shelf
&gt;kind of thing covering the entire back cargo section that was even with the
&gt;top of the back seat with two handles on the top. something to do with the
&gt;foldout lower bed maybe? it was hard to tell. The outside and inside of this
&gt;van were immaculate, wolfsburg grey with the top being white. as I'm looking
&gt;at the outside i realize it's also a synchro. it must have been an '86 or '87,
&gt;judging from the chrome bumpers (last year 87 I think) and the square
&gt;headlights (first year 86 except joel's).
&gt;    Whoever has the adventurewagon (matt?), do you have the deal behind the
&gt;back seat? how does it work.
&gt;    If you could live the extra height as a fixed item, this would be a
&gt;wonderful camper. I want one for christmas.
