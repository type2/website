&gt; your engine case.  only thing in your case, epoxy wouldn't do anything if

	I'll testify to this stuff, too.  I patched a cracked Nissan 280Z 
cylinder head with epoxy.  It was meant to be temporary, but 
the engine ran another 12,000 miles and when I traded it in at an auto 
dealer there was no compression leaking out or coolant leaking into the 
cylinders.  I think the head temps of an air-cooled engine would destroy 
the epoxy, but it might be useful in nursing a wasserboxer along.  At 
lower temp applications, epoxy is fantastic.  I used to fill stripped 
bolt holes with the stuff, then drill and tap it, but now I just spray 
the bolt with silicon (for later release), smear it with epoxy, poke it 
down in the hole, and let it set.
