Subject: Painting Questions Cont.

First, thanks for all the imput...keep it coming.

Second, getting my van painted is turning into a real detective project.
 Today, I went to see a guy who restores classics...he told me my bus was 
not even worth shooting with paint...because the paint that was on the bus
wasn't one of his super $3000 jobs and therefore any paint that I put on it
was probably going to come off in a year or two.  What an ego!!!

Then I called the ONLY MAACO shop within 50mi. of Burbank...in Covina...This
guy tells me that it would cost around $800 to shoot a 2-tone bus and that 
one day was charging me less because they weren't using Urathane but cheaper
enamel.  So I can a guy like me off the street know the difference?  

I did notice that one day's cars didn't have a real glossy shine I don't know
if that was the paint or just dust...my T-Bird shined after I had it painted
Anyway, I'm driving out to Covina to check out MAACO.

What about local guys? How can you tell if they are good? Ask around? Get a
list of past customers?  Seems like a crap shoot...

Martin
