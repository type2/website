Subject:      Droping from the List, For Awhile

Time relocate.
In doing so, I must also change Internet Service Providers

As of now, I'll have to drop from the LIST until I can get set up at the
next site.

It's been warm and rewarding to learn from, communicate and share with
you.

If you need to reach me, email can be temporarily sent to:

                sellersp_at_compuserve_dot_com

I don't check in on COMP-U-SERVE ($$$) very often [perhaps once-weekly]
so don't expect an immediate reply.

Regards,
