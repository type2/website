Subject: RE: /f acceleration


&gt;The place I'm temping has a business unit that manufactures the turbine
&gt;engines for the Navy's Harpoon missile, and it looks like an IDEAL size
&gt;to strap/weld onto the sides of a Transporter for vastly improved freeway
&gt;acceleration.
&gt;
&gt;The only drawback might be the $80,000 apiece price tag...


And the ten-hour Time-Between-Major-Overhaul spec.
