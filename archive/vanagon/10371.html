These figures do not seem to be supported by fact. The engine I have has a
compression ratio of 145 psi(air-cooled). The engine that I junked had
cylinders with a compression ratio of 90, 110, 120 and 110 and ran poorly.
A difference of 44 psi seems far too great, usually 10 % is the norm...DC

&gt; 
&gt; for water-cooled vanagon engines (1.9 and 2.1)
&gt;  nominal ........... 145-189 psi
&gt;  minimum ........... 116 psi
&gt;  max diff .......... 44 psi between any two cylinders
