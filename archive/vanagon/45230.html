&gt;&gt;From my ham radio hobby, I know that the minimum airmail postage cost from

&gt;If you write to Michael, you may want to be nice to him and include a couple
&gt;of one dollar bills, or perhaps even a five dollar bill to cover his postage
&gt;cost. I'll bet he'd also appreciate a self-addressed envelope or a stick-on
&gt;label with your address on it.

You can also buy a 'International Return Postage' stamp from the post office.
