Subject: Introduction from new member



     I am joining this net as a former and prospective owner of a VW bus.
Who knows why the old bus I once owned is coming back to haunt me now? I hope
you don't mind me listening in on your discussions for a while until I
can find a bus of my own. I can't wait until I'm back behind
that huge front window once more! Cheers,
                                              -J.B.
