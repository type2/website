	I pulled into Oil Can Henry's this AM to have them put Synthec into my
	recently purchased econobox Ford PU and they automatically plop a USA
	Today in my lap. I wouldn't give a penny for that POS, but seeing how I
	was alone and no radio, I picked thru the rag and found a section on
	auto futures. Under 1996 VW stuff, they state the UrineVan will be
	available with both a V6 (probably the 15 degree Passat spinner) AND
	sliding door on both sides; wallthru.

	So, present UrineVan owners, still happy yer payin for one now?

	I was ramblin' yesterday about how I'd buy an MV/Weekender to haul
	family etc. Damn, imagine picnicking &amp; camping with an open rig like
	that.
