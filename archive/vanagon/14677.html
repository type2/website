Subject: Propane Heaters

I just came across this mailing list today, so I don't have a feel for what
type of activity goes on here, but I did have one question for anyone out
there who has dealt with installing a heater in their Vanagon.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a good, externally vented, LP heater
for a Westy?
I have been banging my head against the wall trying to find something small
enough and with a low amperage draw.  Any comments would be much
appreciated.  Even my 5 degree REI bag does not cut the mustard for weekend
ski trips in the Van.

Thanks
