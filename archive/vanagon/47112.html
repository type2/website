Subject: Re: late model wheel cover free

Paul,

  I have an '83 diesel Westie which came into my hands used with 4 &quot;wire 
wheel&quot; appearing covers, one of which dissappeared on a washboard road, 
so I replaced them all with 4 small round VW wheel covers that a friend 
had sitting in her garage.  I still have the 3 of 4 set, but have no idea 
if these are the &quot;faux&quot; spoke covers about which you speak.  If they are 
original and I could restore it to having a set of four, I'd love to do 
it.  How can I tell if these are the &quot;faux&quot; spoke covers?  I'll rush out 
and look and get right back to you.

  Thanks,
  John Wakefield
