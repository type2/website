... and again I say...

Personally, on my factory alloys I use a slightly oversize BFGoodrich AT
that is LT rated, and 27x8.5x14. This is a moderately aggressive tread.
Good handling wet or dry, low highway noise, and excellent traction in
off road conditions, especially mud and snow. Other listmembers have
been very happy with these tires. 

BFG makes other tires in the same size with tread patterns that are more
aggressive for heavy mud and stuff, or less agressive for street/highway
use.
