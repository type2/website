Subject: Cal floods over!


I made it out of the mountains (Santa Cruz Mtns) again! I was stuck up
there yesterday and was getting cabin fever, but once again I find my
way to the hot showers at work. Still have no power since Sunday
evening, haven't seen any news yet - missed the whole damn thing, I
would much rather watch it than live thru it. Feel like I have been
camping since Friday, when the west coast pre-trip started; been
cooking on the coleman stove and using propane for light.

This whole storm still wasn't as interesting as being in the middle of
Hugo as it blew thru Charlotte in '89, but it was a good attempt.

Any word on the Copley's progress? Where are they now?
