To keep the tour together even longer on my proposed route, we
could have everone caravan out of St Louis on 50, we all head down
Skyline Drive into Shenandoah, everyone hits I64 down to Newport
News/Norfolk then northerners split up the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel
into Maryland and any all points north, the southerners split down
the Outer Banks, we all stay together a good long time, and people
simply drop off as they reach their homes.  Actually the mideast people
will be most inconvenienced as they will have to loop back to their
homes whichever way they go (myself included)

Just my ramblings as usual

(lets see if I take the Corrado and a tent I can get back at 90 mph)
