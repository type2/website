Subject: Re: Antenna Solution

&gt;I installed a mag mount on my Vanagon.  I installed it on the front, right
&gt;below the Fiberglass top.  I used a m-359 right angle adapter (RS 278-199)
&gt;to re-orient the antenna to the upright position. Of course you can put a
&gt;90 degree bend in the antenna without any loss of performance.

I completely disagree with this, a 90=B0 bend will get the signal out
vertical instead of horizontal.  Antennas radiate from the length of the
whip, so if the whip is oriented horizontal it will transmit verticlally.
Also if I understand this right, your antenna is not directly attached to
the van body, rather, it is attached to an adapter which is attached to the
body. The is will shrink your ground plane and hinder the performance of
the antenna.

In short, this flies in the face of basic antenna theory.  The books I've
read directly contradict your set up.
