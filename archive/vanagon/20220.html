Subject: Re: towing a bus

I second the notion of a rented or borrowed truck, although the 
van-towing-the-van method should probably work.  What kind of towbar will 
you use?  I once towed a van 1000 miles behind a big-ass UHaul; the 
towbar was a generic attached with bolts and steel cables.  I had to hang 
flags 2' out either side of the van just to see it in the outside 
rearviews.  When I completed the trip the seat upholstery was all 
puckered under where I had been sitting.  That happens when I tow VWs, 
for some reason.  I like to think of it as a redundant 
passenger-restraint system.
