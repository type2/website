&gt;&gt;We realize that our members outside the U.S. of A. are very willing to
&gt;&gt;contribute to this effort.  (We've gotten dozens of offers from across the
&gt;&gt;various ponds!)  Unfortunately, the hassle of managing foreign funds makes
&gt;&gt;this impractical.  Thanks anyhow!

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;As you know, David is running
&gt;
&gt;The &quot;Buy the List Admin a Beer&quot; (or two, or six) Campaign
&gt;
&gt;and I asked him how to send Gerry a beer from our continent. But
&gt;now I think we can take part at Ron's funds collection if David
&gt;gives us a hand in shipping the amount. We may sub-collect the fund
&gt;at David's parents (living in Fulda) and send it as one amount to
&gt;US when ever it's possible. Do you agree on this, or do you have other
&gt;ideas?
==================
Hi David, Ron, Chris &amp; Gerry
 I'll be in, with at least one mass of Oktoberfestbier ! 
If anybody tells me where to send in Germany, you can have the $$ (was 10,80 
DM last year) instead - might be easier logistics I guess.

==================

This would be fine with me.
