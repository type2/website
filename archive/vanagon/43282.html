Subject: Re:Vanagon Bake-Off~Nevada Race

It sounds like William Kennedy, Steve Maher, and Tom Forhan need to check
out today's Wall Street Journal.  There is a short article regarding a race
in Nevada where the average speed for the 1995 winning entry over the 90
mile course was something like 182 mph with a top speed of 205 mph in a
modified 1992 Corvette!  The article mentioned that the average speed topped
this year's Indy winners average speed.  Call me calloused from being over
gullible as a youngster but I find it hard to believe.  My Vanagon can only
dream of half that speed. I am proud when the singlecab simply makes it over
a 90 mile course of any kind.
