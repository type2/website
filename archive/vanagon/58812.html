&gt;  I've been working on a better page with Tom. It can be viewed at:
&gt;  
&gt;  http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/roamin.html
&gt;  
&gt;  Check it out, although it is still under work. There's a link to e-mail
the
&gt;  owner from the page.

You can also try Adventure Werks.
They rent Westys in Seattle, Phoenix and Salt Lake City.  Their phone number
is (800) RENT VWS. The woman I talked to there was very pleasant and gave me
the following rates:

1. Classic Westfalias (Bay window buses from the 70's)
Weekly with 1000 miles: $350.
Weekly w/unlimited miles: $450.

2. 91 Vanagon GL Westfalias
Weekly with 1000 miles: $500.
Weekly with 1750 miles: $625.
Weekly w/unlimited miles: $725.

She said that daily, and monthly rates are available as well as airport
pick-up.

They have an internet website at:  http://www.nas_dot_com/~adwerks/
I just looked at the site and it has all their rates and other information -
worth a visit.

Not a customer - just passing along the info that was fresh about 1 year ago.
 Don't know their current prices / status

Happy Trails,
