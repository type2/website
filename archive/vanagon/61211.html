Subject: VW customer opinion-poll [new syncro 16'' ]

Dear listees,

recent correspondence has made it clear that the news about *new VW off-roder 
opinion poll* was to be easily misundertood as fun-stuff - which is not the 
case. Sorry for that, but in the hurry we had no native speaker for double 
checking the text involved.

1. VW's german customer magazine is really named &gt;Gute Fahrt&lt; which may sound 
odd for an english speaking person but means nothing else than whishing: &quot;Have 
a good drive !&quot; (absolutely nothing to do with digestive problems !)

2. The question was quite simple (slightly edited):

&quot;Do you miss a VW or Audi with real off-road capabilities like the syncro 16'' 
Vanagon was ? &quot;

3. Accessing them is not so simple from overseas because they do not have 
direct email.

4. So if you want to comment on a future VW 4x4 off-road Van project:

- simply mail to the Ig syncro 16'' mailbox at: (cct_Tom_Niksch_at_MSN_dot_com)
using &gt;&gt;syncro 2000&lt;&lt; as a subject

- we will be doing the immedeate forwarding for you.

5. You are most welcome to write in english or french if french speaking 
Canadian.

Thanks for contributing your time to this future subject !
