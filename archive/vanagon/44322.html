Subject: I'm so bummed...

Went to pick up the '67 westy today... waited 45 minutes for the 
guy to show up... &quot;I forgot to call ya and tell ya I was gonna be late 
tonight...&quot;  okay so we go 'round back hook up his tractor to pull it 
'round front to where the flat bed can pick it up...

	throw the chain arounf the front beam give a tug... hear this 
crunch... LOUD CRUNCH...!
Bus starts to come apart right behind the front doors!!! the frame that 
I thought was just surface rust was virtually non-existant...!!
	Partner is pissed... his wife who there for the ride is wicked 
pissed... guy who selling the bus is kinda upset...
	luckily I hadn't given him any cash yet...

	so now we are just buying the interior that was stored,
 the Bus roofrack, the bug wood slat roofrack, and some bug bummpers and 
a couple splittie bumpers... for WAY less...

	Jim E. all the stuff you requested was cracked or in poor shape 
except the door cabinet...

	
		Still Splittieless in NH...
