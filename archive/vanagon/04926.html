Subject: Special 4x4 Vanagon Manual

Horray! 

After two years of failures I finally received in the mail today the manual
called &quot;Workshop Manual Volkswagen Transporter; Four-wheel drive 5-speed
manual gearbox 094 and final drive; July 1986 Edition; Service Department.&quot;

The manual states on page 1: &quot;This Workshop Manual is only for use within the
VW Organisation and is not to be passed on to any other person or persons.
All rights reserved.&quot;

The manual covers interesting things like the Vanagon with front differential
lock and the Vanagon which lacks the viscous coupling and instead works by
means of a central diff lock betweeen the front and the rear.

It is also a thorough treatment of the repair of the front and rear
transmissions/differentials.
