So David Kao says:
&gt; What I did was I bought a pair of 6 1/2 inch subwoofers. I flush mounted
&gt; them below the original Blaupunkt speakers and changed a little bit of the
&gt; wiring. 

You lost me on this mounting bit David.  Are you saying you mounted the
subwoofers (I have a hard time calling 6 1/2 inch speakers woofers) below
and perpendicular to the Blaupunkt's or what?
