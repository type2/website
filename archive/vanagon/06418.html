Norm wonders if he can get his ABS on the EV to chatter...

I've done it on ice and snow as well as on wet leaves by wailing
on the brakes (assuming no cars behind me...) You can set up
a minimum chatter which manifests itself as a &quot;humming&quot; sound similar
to the noise a flat spot on a tire makes by jamming on the brakes
from a high speed. With ABS I've found myself &quot;late braking&quot; to go
onto an exit ramp from time to time..   :-)
