Subject: I heard a 'nasty' rumor!

Hi Volks,

  I don't want to get anyones hopes up, thats why I think this is a 'nasty'
rumor.   I heard a that VW was thinking of bringing back the Vanagon, with
a new designed in-line 16v motor, similar to the late Golf GTI motor. With
better torgue and better geared 5-speed trans. Anyone else heard this?  If
it true, great!  I'll be a the dealer in a 'NY minute' to buy one. Rumors
like this float around all the time, just wondering if anyone else heard
this to.  Thanks.
