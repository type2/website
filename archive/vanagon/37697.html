&gt; True story: there's a guy driving a '94/'95 EV around here in S.F. with copies 
&gt; of press releases all over the windows slamming the &quot;no bumper&quot;, &quot;bad gas-tank 
&gt; placement&quot;, and many other &quot;unsafe&quot; items about the bus. Big ole &quot;LEMON&quot;  
&gt; stickers all over the place. I guess he's supposed to be informing the public. 
&gt; Anyhow, I've seen the van for about a year and what I can't figure out is: If 
&gt; the van is so bad and unsafe, why is he still driving it around? Go figure.;)

Because he's just full of sour grapes?  I don't know.

&gt; I'm new to this list and VW Westies, but plan on buying one in about a year. The 
&gt; info on this list is better than any mag or press-release! Also, what's up with 
&gt; the new Westy's big nose? Has the engine been moved?

New Westy?  Kind of hard to get a Westy anymore in the US.  Do you mean 
does the Eurovan have an engine up front?  Yes.  Front engine - front 
wheel drive.  If you mean something else?  I don't know.

The EV is well loved by some of us.  Harangued by others...
