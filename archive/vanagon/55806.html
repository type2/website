Subject: Re: Clean the water tank?

     Yes Kyle,
     
     Look underneath your van near the water tank.  There should be a drain 
     plug.  Just unscrew it and watch the water spill all over the ground.
     
     Hope this helps...................

     Anyone know anyway to drain the water out of the water tank in a 
     camper? The water in mine has been in there a while, and I would like 
     to put fresh water in there once it gets warm enough to camp again.
     
     any advice would be helpful!!!
     
     thanks
