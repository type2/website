Subject:      How to ... in the Woods.

what with all this Squat-Pot talk and such, i thought i might pass along
a small tidbit of info to our distaff side (i.e., the women) of the list:

there is a book called &quot;How to Shit in the Woods&quot;.

no, really. it's a real book, and that really is the title. i'm pretty sure
it's by Ten Speed Press. and it deals with exactly that: how to go in the
woods ... rather than using the right front tire, or a porta-potti.

one may assume, in the glaring absence of such a book for Men, that we Males
are born with this information.  i do recall, however, that we were given
classes in basic training in the Army ... to learn how to do things The Army
Way. :)
