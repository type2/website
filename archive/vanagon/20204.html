Subject: Part #/plans for front end skid plates?

Hello everybody,

Well, I'm getting kind of tired having to remove the pan under the pedals 
in my '76 westy to pound out the dents acquired while exploring beautiful 
BC's back country.  The bumper seems to plow dirt and rocks just fine (so 
I don't need any Roo bar style reinforcement at this point), but I'd sure 
like to protect the underbody area forward of the front wheels.

I have a copy of the VW VAG Service publication &quot;Technical 
Recommendation: Journeys under difficult conditions&quot; for the VW 
Transporter/Caravelle and LT, but they only show plans for skid plates 
for the motor, transmission, and underbody _behind_ the front wheels.  
What do you other folks do to avoid damage?  Do synchos have a skid plate 
in this area?  Derek Drew, maybe you can offer advice (although I've 
heard the underside of your synchro looks like a war zone)?

The crunched &quot;under the pedal&quot; pan is more an inconvenience at this point 
than anything, but I'm worried I might mash something more $$$ sometime.

TIA,
Tobin
