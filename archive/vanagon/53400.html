Subject: 2.1L parts prices?

An acquaintance has offered me his nice-looking 1989 GL for the price he
was offered as trade-in with a new car purchase.  I think $3,000 sounds
good for such a late model and will probably buy it. 

I've been driving a diesel so I'm not familiar with parts prices for the
2.1L.  Would some owners please post some of the more shocking prices they
have paid for parts?  I'm particularly worried about parts like the
airflow sensor, idle stabilizer, injectors, catalytic converter, muffler,
etc., and if they are very expensive I'll plan on checking them out
carefully. 

Thanks.
