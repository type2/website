Subject: digifant ecu still needed :-(
Date: Tue, 11 Feb 1997 12:52:09 -0500

Hi All,

Thanks to Joel, the recall was confirmed with an actual letter, receipt,
invoice and official procedure! Unfortunately, with that info and some good
assistance from VWoA (NOT my local dealer), I found out this recall had
already been performed on my van long ago by the original owner :-(

To add to that disappointment, the used ECU I bought turned out bad too.

So, I'm still in need of a digifant ECU from the years '86-'91.

A couple of you said you may have one, but since I &quot;thought&quot; I had one, the
messages have been deleted. Sorry. Hindsight, huh?

Thanks for all the help!

tony
