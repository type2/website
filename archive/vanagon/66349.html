Tony did another VW cartoon using a Golf or jetta being chased by
4x4's.  Tony Auth of the Philly Inquirer uses VW's in his drawings
alot.  I look forward to his pieces every morning.

You should be able to find his stuff at www.phillynews_dot_com.

&gt; Just last week a good friend gave me a copy of a political cartoon by Tony
&gt; Auth, from the Phila. Inquirer.  It was an orbiting VW bus, trailing various
&gt; parts.  It was marked MIR on the side.  I'm hoping to get it scanned this
&gt; weekend and will post it some time next week.
