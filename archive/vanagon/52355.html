&gt; We had a thread a while ago about several people not knowing about the oil
&gt; filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt; weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt; revolve!  Any others out there?
 

heck,  I have to admit that i didn't know the back seat would prop up
for easy loading and unloading.  I discovered it while trying to figure
out where I could put my new Cannondale tandem (I take off the front
wheel, prop up the back seat, back it in thru the sliding door, put the
back wheel between the front seats and bungee the handlebars to the
bottom of the back seat.  it works well, but I gotta figure out a way to
carry it on the outside...).
