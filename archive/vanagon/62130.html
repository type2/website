Subject: A/C electrical shutoff by pressure...??

HI everyone.....since all this stuff bout ac is goin on ..im wonderin bout
mine...ok so I bought the van finding out that the ac had just suddenly
stopped working bout a year ago ...and then during the winter it just kicks
in and begins to work..of course freezing cuz its like 20 outside and my
air's running.....but anyways....now bout a week ago my air suddenly stops
working agian....now i was told at the Litchfield fest that there is somethin
in the compressoer that shuts off the electical so you wont blow it out...if
the pressure is too low....is this true...and does anyone know a shop that
works on VW vanagon a/c's in CT or Mass in the hartford or springfield area
cuz i cant find anyone....???? THanks all...
