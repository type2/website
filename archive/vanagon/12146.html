Subject: Busted ignition switch

I've got a '73 Campmobile with a busted ignition switch.
At lunch I turned the key and the oil, alt and brake lights went
on.  This is normal as it is to prove the lightbulbs are working.
What's not normal is they stayed on and the starter did not engage.
I turn the key off and out of the switch and the lights are still
on.  I suspect the ignition switch is going farther South.

I took the key switch out of the column and found that the little
(cheap pot-metal) shaft from the key tumblers to the electrical
connector has broken.  Woe is me.  I'll be looking for this part
at the dealer for around $45 special order.  :(
