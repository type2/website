Subject: Removed Vanagon head - aaargh!
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 95 09:21:01 +0000 (GMT)

Hi.
OK, a quick recap - I discovered my newly purchased 1986 Vanagon was leaking
coolant from the c-head.  
So today I bought a head gasket set (passenger side _at_ $75) and a Bently
manual (&amp; $90) and went to work.  I removed the head without removing the
engine - went OK.  When I removed the cylinder head, the cylinder liner came
out a bit (1cm) - so I just pushed it back in.  I am planning &lt;not&gt; to have
to remove the liner to replace the o-ring seal.
The head is very badly corroded where the large rubber gasket seals on the
head.  It is quite obvious where the coolant leak was coming from.  The
manual says to replace the head if any corrosion is evident ($$$!!!) - so my
question is - is this really necessary? - and since I can't afford it at the
moment - what can I do to avoid having to replace this head (and then the
other head as well).  Is is it possible to skim the head (machine it?)?
BTW, in my opinion, the Bently manual really sucks!  Even simple tasks such
as draining the coolant are described in such a manner as to make them
completely uninteligible.  I have checked out the Vanagon Information site
on the WWW but was unable to retrieve the Cylinder Head Leaking FAQ - if
someone could e-mail that to me - I greatly appreciate it!  Of course, any
advice from someone who has tackled this job would be great as well.
Cheers,   MIKE
