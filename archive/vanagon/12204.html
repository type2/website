&gt;--dan, who has never lost a car to anything
&gt;       other than rust and who cannot imagine
&gt;       why salt is to be preferred over chains

I kinda _like_ chains.  And whips, too!

I have been fortunate to live out of the rust belt, but I &quot;feel your pain&quot;
with my '56 kombi, which, by the way, is now close to rust-free.

I read a story in Excellence (Porsche rag) about a guy who went to look
at a 356 which was advertised as a &quot;rust free classic&quot; only to get there
and the thing was a pile of swiss cheese.  He confronted the seller about
this, who then replied, &quot;Yup, the rust is free!&quot;
