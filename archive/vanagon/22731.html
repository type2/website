Subject: '87 Syncro Engine Idle

Hi all, 

This is the first time I've really had to work with an electronic ignition
system, and I haven't come up with the $60+ to buy a Bentley yet (too bad
there isn't a Haynes for this).  When it's hot and the AC is on I'm used to a
higher idle in cars but I think that 2,000 to 3,000 is a_bit_on the high
side.  My only prior experience with W/C VW's is with two Rabbits (1 gas and
1 diesel).  Is this normal?  I don't think so!  What can I do for it?  Please
help!
