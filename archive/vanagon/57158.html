Subject: re:Searching for VanBondo, help in Phoenix

can't really help you except to say that vanbondo had a short blurb a
little while ago (a week or two) that he was leaving his job (and web
access) suddenly.  You really should just post your problem to the list.
you usually get some very thorough replys with which you can either:  fix
it yourself - or - not get totally screwed at the fix-it shop.

read your column in dirt rag with envy...if you can rebuild hubs and bottom
brackets, you can fix your bus.
