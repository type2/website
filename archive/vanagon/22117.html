Subject: RE: Getting Drums back on '71?


&gt;Is there some trick I don't know? Am I forgetting something? After putting
&gt;on my new brake shoes and adjusting down my adjusters, I can't get my drums
&gt;back on. I've tried centering the shoes, but still, no luck. Should I
&gt;remove the drums from the hubs and try it in two steps (I know now that I
&gt;didn't have to remove the hubs, but I didn't realize that when I started).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all your advice and patience with me. 8-)


Release the parking brake.
