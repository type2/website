Subject: Re: Stinkin' stickin' slidin' door

I also had the same problem on the sliding door that it needed to be pushed
from inside to open it. The latch mechanism at the rear of the door was
totally dried out of lub. When the latch was realeased the sping just could
not push it open by itself any longer.

I took the panel off from inside of the door and took the latch off.
After applying some good grease and replaced it back the problem was
fixed. My wife was glad that it was fixed before everyone's wrist was injured.
It took me couple of months before I finally worked on it though.
