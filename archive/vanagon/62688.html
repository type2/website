Subject: RPT: New Listserver HW &amp; 'Gerry'

Hi All,

I was in San Diego earlier this week and met up with Chris Smith who gave
me a tour of the Super-Computing Center and the Vanagon list's newly
purchased hardware--*very* impressive!!! The new server's name is 'Gerry'
after our current list manager.  I was great to see the outcome of the
efforts to relocate the list and for those who volunteered their money
and time to make it happen I can say **Thank You**, Vanagon will be well
served for a long time to come!!!  8-)
