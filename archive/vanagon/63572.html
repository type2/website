Subject: Re: gears for syncro 16--tall tires

Is that all their is to it?

Now all we have to determine is how narrow a 31.5&quot; tall tire would have to
be to fit in the wheelwells with the 16&quot;/sawzall/plastic-wheelwell setup
without bumping into other suspension components, such as springs, etc.

Thomas, are you telling me you don't know this off the top of your head?

If so, then its on to the microfiche, to study what parts to order to change
ring and pinion to 6.14.

&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;
&gt;straight ratio 6.13/4.86 x 25&quot; = 31.5&quot;  yeeehaw! that ratio is for
&gt;TD-16&quot; which is worst case, poor power + big wheels, wonder if it can
&gt;break 55mph?   cheers, tim
