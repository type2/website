&gt;i have always, yes ALWAYS, done better by %10 to %30 than the posted 
&gt;milage with my chevies and buicks, and nearly doubled the expected 
&gt;milage with one big, beutifull caddie.
&gt;so i would think that i DO know how to drive in a gas saveing manner.

Do you suppose that the combination of an automatic and a wheelchair lift
(increased overall weight) might be the cause of your poor mileage?
Unfortunately, I have a 5 sp and the absolute worst overall mileage I've
gotten is 17.x mpg, so it's tough to do a fair comparison.  70 mph w/AC
on the freeway returned 20+ mpg.
Any engine mods to boost those 109 horses?
