        Yes, but that wouldn't get you home with an adventure and a
splittie. Even a rust bucket splittie is better than none, IMHO. By the
same token, might it not be easier for us to buy/drive Nissans? Of course,
let's see what I say after my next encounter with some annoying break
down-it's easy to wax philosophical when in front of the Mac in the A/C
with a cool drink...   ;-)
