&gt;                    MODEL and YEAR
&gt;  ______________________________________________
&gt;
&gt;OK, since a picture is worth a thousand words, how about some 
good
&gt;theories on the distribution of models by year and design.  
For 
&gt;example, if we make a lot of assumptions, can we conclude that 
the
&gt;early vanagons were not popular with the old bus enthusiasts 
since
&gt;there seem to be very few represented in our sample?  ... Hope 
I stir &gt;things up a bit ;}

... is the fact that everyone conveniently forgets a certain 
1991 Transporter T4 can exist even though evryone is 
pre-occupied by the '91 Vanagon?  ;P

I like the chart now that the blue thing is in its rightful 
place.

Now - to business.

As has been seen many times in the past, I tend to burble on 
about things just for the sake of talking (or typing.)  I've 
been very quiet for a couple of days, so I feel that I should 
inflict myself upon your monitors again.

The blue thing has decided that its glow plugs need changing.  
Since early last week, when I posted a comment that it wouldn't 
start, it has been misbehaving.  If the engine (a diesel, 
remember) is cold, its starting procedure sounds like the death 
rattle of a dehydrated donkey.  The poor ol' engine turns and 
turns and turns - great big clouds of noxious fumes pour from 
the exhaust pipe and - nothing.

I can wait until 2 or 3 pm when the air is a little warmer and 
it catches without so much melodrama.  Of course, once the 
engine fires and is warm, it is as impeccably behaved as 
always.

Someone (to whom I owe thanks) mentioned that it may be the 
glow plugs.  A friend of mine, a good mechanic, listened to my 
story in the pouring rain this morning and agreed.  He said 
that I'm not doing any great damage to the engine by starting 
it in this manner and he said that he'll change the 'plugs on 
Thursday evening.  I'll do an oil and filter change at the same 
time.

Well, I haven't a *clue* what a glow plug looks like - or where 
the lil' critters reside in the engine bay.  My friend said 
that a plug costs around fifteen pounds apiece and that I may 
have to replace only the faulty ones.

This guy, for all his good points (and the fact that I've known 
him for all my life), is a trustworthy individual.  However, I 
really would like one of you to confirm if it is correct.  You 
see, he is the same person who this the first oil change on my 
T4.  We put it onto the lift and went underneath.  He then 
stood between the rear wheels and spent a couple of minutes (no 
joke) searching for the releases for the engine cover.  When I 
politely 'ahemed' and said that the engine is 'up this end' he 
lowered the blue thing to the ground to be certain that it was 
a Volkswagen...

... I suppose you can't blame the guy for that ...
