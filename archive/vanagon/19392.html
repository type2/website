Subject: Baja in October?

	Friends,
	I might, maybe, be able to do the Baja thing in the last week
of October- I've got prior commitments the first and second weekends.

	I can confirm from last Friday's visit that traffic coming
into USA from USM is awful- looked like a 4 hour wait at noon on
Friday. Suggestion: Make sure your gas tank is full! If you've not
done this kind of thing before, you might leave your engine idling
for half the time and boy would THAT torpedo your milage! Make sure
your water bottle is full too, no shade in the waiting line. Bring
something to read, or sew, or a couple of favorite tapes.

	On the other hand, I enthusiasticly recomend the prickly pear
cactus that kids sell along the street in Tijuana- an interesting
spicy taste out at the tip and milder as you get back down the leaf/
paddle/whatever you call them. I followed Tobin's advice and bought
some since that's what the kids on the sidewalk were selling.

	Cheers!
	Bill
