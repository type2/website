Subject: Re:  Cops, Busses and Belly Pans

&gt;What are these belly pans?

As Mr. Bozo was my first Type II, I thought they were standard issue for
several years.  Not til much later did I crawl under another bus and see
the floor!  The pans have a cross pattern pressed into them from corner to
corner (like commercial a/c ducts) and are just welded on from rocker
panels to front and rear of cargo floor cross-braces.  The entire cargo
section is sealed.

&gt;I was thinking of fabricating someting like that
&gt;for my bus to keep all my new undercoating clean and dry.  You'd
&gt;prolly also get a littl ebetter mileage.  Anyone ever seen the underbelly
&gt;of the newer 911's?  Its like a toy car - all flat except where the
&gt;wheels stick out.

I crawled under one at a car show and was amused and annoyed - clever idea,
but it kept me from looking at the parts...
