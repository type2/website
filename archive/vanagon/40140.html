Subject: 87 Syncro for sale - CO

I am putting my 87 syncro up for sale.  I am in the process of purchasing a
new house and need the equity.

I have owned it for just over a year and have totally worked it over.  Just
recently 
(Jan 1-1996) I installed a Remanufactured engine (by VW) in it.  Addtionally,
Waterpump, Reman power steering rack, New Brakes, New Idle Regulator, Clean
the Air flow meter, New Battery, New Tires, and over all kept the vehicle to
100%.

I have all receipts.

I will definitely miss it.  And, After the Financing is over - be looking for
another

Asking $8,900.  Firm
