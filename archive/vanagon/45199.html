Subject: Oil Temps, Coolers, and pumps, separated circuits?
Date: Tue, 25 Jun 96 09:54:00 DST


With all the talk of coolers, temperatures and location I was inspired by 
the question about 12v water pumps.
How about a totally separate oil cooling circuit. A small electric pump 
could be used to draw oil from the sump, pass it forward to a cooler mounted 
in the air flow around the front axle somewhere and return it to the sump. 
The pump would be controlled by a thermostat to only circulate oil when 
additional cooling was required. This would avoid the problems associated 
with oil pressure loss through long lines, overcooling in the winter and 
slow warm up. Also any problem associated with the cooling circuit could be 
readily isolated and not affect normal riunning. Any further ideas in this 
direction?
