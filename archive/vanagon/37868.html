I REALLY like your drawing!  That is too cool!

Glad to hear that you are FINALLY getting things taken care of with Urge!
 This probably goes with out saying, but I assume that you will NEVER go to
THAT shop again!  Kep us informed!

Glad to hear that Lima Bean is up and running!  How is he doing now?  I
assume that you have taken him out on the road?  

Take care,

Tim :)
