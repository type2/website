RE:	Copy of: Re: Copy of: Bench seats for the front

&gt;Where do you want to place the 3 additional seats? On the engine's 
&gt;compartment?
&gt;I think this only usable for kids.

Yes, The 12 passenger model is in the U.K. VW dealer brochure I have. The rear
bench seat appears to be slightly elevated above the rest, and the other bench
seats are positioned closer together to each other, and have less leg room. In
the picture, there are 12 headrests in the Van! 

&gt;The 'Bus' logo you will find on nearly every German Transporter equipped 
&gt;with
&gt;windows.

What about &quot;Caravelles&quot;?  I always thought they were more of a upscale version
of the van. 

&gt; The so called Kombis have no side lids 

What do you mean by &quot;side lids&quot;?
