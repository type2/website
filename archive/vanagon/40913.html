&gt;Cost would be approximately U.S. $1,824.00 (R7605.00) FOB
&gt;Johannesburg Airport.

Hmmm, what kind of power gain are we getting here?
50% is 48HP, upping it to say 143HP from 95. Opting for a 130HP Subaru motor
for about the same amount of money gets rid of head gasket problems forever,
and gets way cheaper parts too, plus no added expensive parts like a turbo!
I'll keep it simple.  Tim Smith
