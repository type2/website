Subject: WANTED: Cool paint ideas

I'm close to respraying the boring white '86 &quot;Turtle&quot; (Country Homes
Camper) and would love to get some input on ways to paint her. I figure a
two-tone job, with the dividing line at either the mid-wheel well line or
the under-the-window line. She's blue inside and I think the upper color
will remain white, with a blue or grey non-metallic bottom. A custom
third-color stripe is something else I'm considering.

Does anyone have reference photos or other suggestions for a snazzier
vanagon paint scheme?
