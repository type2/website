Subject: Re: acceleration flat spot(F)

Joel was talking about how i've done it ever since some idiot brotherless
source telling him, &quot;just grab hold of the wires ... it won't hurt you!&quot;
&gt;ohyezzzz ... if they're arcing, you might be sparking, when you grab. ;)

The story reminded me of an incident that happened while I was working at
the local bicycle shop during my high school daze.  We were always playing
jokes and messing around as we were a fun loving group of hippie yahoos.
Being the wise person that I am now took years. I was really niave/gullible
as a kid. 
One day the owner of the shop was working on a front wheel hub that had a
generator in it called a &quot;Dyno hub.&quot; I was convinced that he misplaced his
continuity tester and needed know if he was getting power. If we hooked up
the leads to the braces that were on my teeth at the time, I would be able
to tell. Promising not to shock me I dutifully hooked up one lead to each of
the upper and lower teeth. I was promised that I would only feel a &quot;tickle.&quot;
Well, at the opportuned second one of jokers reached over and gave the wheel
a heck of a whirl at top speed!!!!!!!
Yow, tallk about psychadelic flashbacks- I thought I saw the Lord before my
eyes. Boy Howdy, my jaw slammed shut faster than a 6v starter in a 12v VW.
The troops never let me live that one down. It was soon after that incident
that I discovered the Allman Brothers Band and Black Sabbath records.;)

(Embarassing true story)
