Kevin Toney provided this to the Type3 list over the weekend.  I just
cleaned up some typos, and here is some interesting info.

You may 
recall my assertion that the new formulation of gas used in California 
(which is different and more extreme than those used in other states) 
caused significantly lower mileage.  I finally tracked down the article 
and references.

This is also to help explain to the rest of you why we Californians seem 
to be whining about our gas.  It's because we really do have something 
to complain about.

 In the San Francisco Bay Area, reformulated gasoline (RFG) has created 
a quite a controversy Since last  May, it has become an issue that has 
stirred up considerable media attention. After receiving numerous  
complaints from local viewers, KGO-TV an affiliate of ABC, began an 
investigation into reformulated gasoline.  The investigation included 
Skyline College's Automotive Technology students, the California 
Resources Board  (CARB), K N Filters, an independent Smog Check station, 
an expert on rubber hoses.  Background: What Is RFG?

The reformulation gasoline (RFG) program is one of the latest in a 
series of measures taken to provide leaner burning automotive fuels. RFG 
is often confused with oxygenated gasoline. While both contain 
oxygenates, such as ethanol and MTBE, they are not exactly the same. 
Oxygenated fuels are simply  conventional gasolines with an oxygenate 
added.  Oxygenated fuels are sold during the winter months to reduce CO 
emissions.   RFG gasolines contain oxygenates but undergo other 
compositional and property  alterations to reduce ozone forming 
emissions. RFG is a year round program.   The primary differences 
between RFG and conventional gasoline are as follows: 
 1. Benzene is limited to 1% in RFG.
 2. Volatility is reduced in summer grades of RFG.
 3. Every gallon of RFG must contain oxygenates.   An oxygenated 
gasoline is oxygenated by the addition of an alcohol or ether. The 
most commonly used alcohol is ethanol and the most commonly used ether 
is MTBE.

The primary oxygenate used in RFG is MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether). 
MTBE is used as an octane enhancer, It is not as sensitive to water as 
are alcohols and does not increase the volatility of most gasolines. 

 At the same time, it is the additive that is creating much of the 
controversy. Reports indicate that it is the additive responsible for 
removing the compounds in fuel hoses responsible for preventing leaks.

Independent Tests: MPG Test

 The process was initiated at my college. KGO-TV asked if we would 
conduct a dynamometer test using a reformulated and non-reformulated 
fuel. We gladly g accepted the challenge. They provided us with two 
gallons of non-reformulated fuel purchased from Nevada and two gallons 
of  California's reformulated.

 Using my class of advanced engine performance students and our Clayton 
Dynamometer, we conducted a series of steady state fuel economy tests. 
The vehicle used was a well maintained 1990 Oldsmobile - front wheel 
drive, 3800 V6 engine, and four-speed automatic transmission. 

 All fluid levels were checked and tire pressure was set to 32 psi The 
vehicle was run until it reached operating temperature.  The vehicle was 
prepared as if the fuel injectors were to be cleaned. We used an OTC 
injection cleaner canister, disconnected the fuel pump and pressure 
regulator, and set fuel pressure to 32 psi. This was lower than 
specifications, but it assured us that no fuel would be returned to the 
fuel tank.

 All tests were conducted by the same driver. Another student monitored 
the data stream using a Monitor 4000. This allowed the driver to achieve 
the same throttle position and mass air flow during each test.

 The dynamometer load was set to ten horsepower at forty-five miles per 
hour. This was equivalent to a light load cruise.

 The results were very obvious, The non-reformulated produced a 26.49 
mpg and the reformulated fuel produced 24.91 mpg, or 1.58 mpg less.  
This equated to a 6% difference, almost double CARB's prediction of a 1 
to 396 decrease in overall mpg.

 What better way to conduct the test? We weren't concerned with radical 
changes in acceleration and deceleration, air conditioning and power 
steering loads, or extended idle conditions. While this is not as 
scientific as Federal Test Procedures (ETP), it was a good comparison of 
two different fuels tested under identical conditions.

Horsepower Test

A few days later, KGO visited K &amp; N Filters in Southern California. K &amp; 
N conducted an inertia dynamometer horsepower test using both types of 
gasolines. Their tests produced a 5% decrease in horsepower using 
reformulated fuel.

 Further investigation by KGO showed that consumers were flocking to the 
parts stores to buy fuel tank additives in an attempt to regain fuel 
economy and horsepower.

BAR '90 Smog Check

 At this point in time the test results show 6% decrease in mpg and a 5% 
decrease in horsepower to the drive wheels. 

 Overlooking the decrease in MPG and horsepower, KGO-TV attempted to 
identify the main goal of reformulated fuel, which is to reduce air 
pollution.

 A BAR '90 two-speed idle Smog Check was conducted at our facility using 
the same 1990 Oldsmobile used in the MPG test. Both types of fuel were 
tested and the results were almost identical. Idle and 2500 rpm produced 
6 ppm HC and O% CO.  Obviously, the converter was doing its job.

 During the following week KGO-TV visited an independent repair shop 
licensed to perform Smog  Checks. They performed the smog test using a 
1974 BMW without a catalytic converter. The differences were 
appreciable. The non-reformulated gasoline produced 101 ppm HC and 3.94% 
CO at idle and 54 ppm HC and 2.52% CO at 2500 rpm. The reformulated 
gasoline produced 82 ppm HC and 3.54% CO at idle and 64 ppm HC and 4.19% 
CO at 2500 rpm.

 Obviously, the reformulated gasoline produced lower HC readings, but CO 
reading at 2500 rpm was  significantly higher. Keeping in mind that the 
new fuels aimed at reducing emissions. it has also failed  this test.

 CARB officials claim the new gasoline was tested in over 800 vehicles 
driven five million miles using  500,000 gallons of gasoline. CARB 
reports the new fuel will reduce toxic air pollution by 15%. In  
addition, it will reduce cancer causing  Benzene by 50%. CARB sources 
claim it is the world's cleanest burning gas.

John Dunlap, Chairman of the Air Resources Board, also stated that the 
new fuel is the equivalent of removing 3.5 million vehicle from our 
roads. It is also 25% of CARB's plan for ozone reduction and will remove 
300 tons of air pollution from our atmosphere.

 Mr. Dunlap reports that complaints of decreased mileage and performance 
are related to poor vehicle  maintenance and driving habits and not the 
reformulated gasoline. He claims that some of the complaints might have 
been caused by the warm weather and the use of air conditioner which can 
reduce MPG by as much as 20%. 

Impact on Rubber Lines

 Another investigation by KGO-TV dealt with the impact reformulated 
gasoline have on rubber fuel lines.  Mr. Dunlap states the new fuels 
will not damage an engine or create fuel leaks that might cause a fire.

 If this is the case, why has Chevron posted signs on their pumps 
warning that the new gas may cause fuel leaks? KGO-TV also reported that 
Chevron has warned their retired employees of the new fuel leak  
problems.

 Another report indicates that car fires are up 10% this year compared 
to the same time year. Nissan currently has a recall campaign for many 
of  their mid 1980 fuel injected vehicles. This because the MTBE in the 
reformulated gasoline attacks the elastomers used in the rubber hoses 
causing them to leak.

 The Rubber hoses in question are made of Nitrile which is used in 
vehicles prior to 1991. In California, this equates to 15,000,000 
vehicles that are equipped with this type of fuel lines.

 Independent tests have shown that MTBE attacks Nitrile parts in the 
fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel tank, fuel  injectors, fuel pressure 
regulator, and fuel rails. While CARB denies these reports, their own 
field  investigators report that many of the problems they are seeing 
are directly related to the fuel leaks.

 A spokesman for the American Chemical Society and Rubber Manufacturers 
Association reported that  MTBE increases the chances of fuel leaks in 
vehicles built prior to 1990. SAE, Dupont, 3M, and Zeon  Chemicals have 
all confirmed that MTBE does breakdown Nitrile rubber parts. How much 
Nitrile is in a complete fuel system? It is difficult to tell because 
manufacturers will not release this information.

 Reports show that aftermarket rubber parts may still contain Nitrile. 

Summary

 The tests conducted at our college, K &amp; N Filters, and the independent 
repair shop were performed, at the request of KGO-TV in an attempt to 
validate consumer complaints. The complaints registered by  consumers 
were verified by the 6% decrease in mpg, the 5% decrease in horsepower, 
and the increase of 1.5% more CO, during a 2500 rpm smog test.

 It is evident the CARB has become very defensive and somewhat hostile 
about the new gasoline. This is  probably because they want to avoid 
another &quot;Diesel Fiasco&quot; which occurred in 1993-94.
