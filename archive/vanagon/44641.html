Subject: Oil cooler for 81 Westy

I ordered an oil cooler from JCW today which along with sandwich adapter and
hoses etc cost $100. Following the advice of the list I stayed away from the
tube type in favor of the plate type or whatever the term is for the better
idea. I selected the size that was described as being for mid to full size
cars as opposed to the truck and van size. Notwithstanding the size of the
vanagon, it seemed to me that of greater relevance was the little bitty motor
and oil capacity that pushes this thing around. The smallest version had 1/2
the capacity and the larger 1/3 more. The dimensions are 1 1/2&quot;x 5 3/4&quot;x 11&quot;.
Someone please howl if I'm guessing wrong on this.

Where do you place these? For safety and access to cool air it makes sense to
place it within the engine compartment above the tin. On the other hand, we
spend a lot of time trying to keep warm air outside of the engine compartment
so that seems to argue for keeping it somewhere below the tin. I can see that
would limit effectiveness over hot asphalt at idle. What's the right answer?

Thanks,

Weston
