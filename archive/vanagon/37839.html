Some of list conversations with other members indicate that driving it to 
seattle would be worth your while--way over blue book prices and with your 
maintenance complete, a bargaining tool for even more.

I believe one quote was $10,400 for an 87 syncro GL with 95kmi

|&gt; I think I'm interested in selling my 86 Westy syncro. Not camping
|&gt; anymore - what is a realistic price to ask?  I bought it new and
|&gt; have all the repair records. Just replaced the heads, muffler and a
|&gt; a wheel bearing.  Small rust in seams, noisy sink console and small
|&gt; dent in nose from a flying 2x4, bra covers it. It has air, stereo
|&gt; and all the other standards.  Sherwin

|Just one data point on an '86 Syncro Westie in NY (They are scarce here).
|
|I saw one for sale some time ago. The lady was asking $7800.
|
|Data: '86 Syncro Westie Weekender (Poptop and electrical fridge but
|without the stove and sink). Some 60 000 miles. Rusted muffler.
|Couldn't see much other rust. Recent tranny repair (diff lock). Clean
|camping interior (Nearly unused! Why do these people buy westies?)
|Two tone brown exterior. Similar interior colors.
|
|I wanted a full camper interior (like my '82) and didn't like the
|brown color, so I passed. Was bought by another westy owner who
|upgraded 2WD -&gt; 4WD. I don't know actual selling price.
|
|Tip: If you want to sell locally put for sale signs in the windows.
|VW bus addicts tend to fixate intensively on brick-shaped moving
|objects. I would guess that this kind of exposure is more effective
|than placing microscopic ads in the local &quot;shopping guides&quot;.
|Stimulates impulse buying ;-)
