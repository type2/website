Subject: *** IMPORTANT *** Credit Card Fraud

I recieved this form someone in work

 Your name, social security number, current address, previous                  
  addresses, mother's maiden name, birth date and other personal                
  information are now available to anyone with a credit card through a          
  new Lexis database called P-Trak. As I am sure you are aware, this            
  information could be used to commit credit card fraud or otherwise            
  allow someone else to use your identity.                                      
                                                                                
  You can have your name and information removed from this list by              
  making a telephone request. Call (800)543-6862, select option 4 and           
  then option 9 (&quot;P-trak&quot;) and tell the representative answering that you       
  wish to remove your name from the P-trax database. You may also               
  send a fax to (513) 865-1930, or physical mail to LEXIS-NEXIS attn:           
                                                                                
  P-trax / P.O. Box 933 / Dayton, Ohio 45401-0933. Sending physical mail        
  to confirm your name has been removed is always a good idea.                  
                                                                                
  As word of the existence of this database has spread on the net,              
  Lexis-Nexis has been inundated with calls, and has set up a special set       
  of operators to handle the volume. In addition, Andrew Bleh (rhymes           
  with &quot;Play&quot;) is a manager responsible for this product, and is the person     
  to whom complaints about the service could be directed. He can be             
  reached at the above 800 number. Ask for extension 3385. According            
  to Lexis, the manager responsible is Bill Fister at extension 1364.
 
        They are no longer accepting calls but you can fax toll-free to 
        1-800-732-7672 or send email direct to p-trak_at_lexis-nexis-com.
        
        Sorry for the no VW content, but I thought this was important to share.
