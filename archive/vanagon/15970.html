 I believe my Haynes book, 4400 rpm limit on the bus, after that, HD singles
 &gt; or duals.

 That can't be right for the type IV motor. Max. horsepower on a _stock_ 1700 
 is at 4800 rpm.  Same for the fuel injected 1800 used in '75. I think the
 two liter type IV has max hp at 4200, but I'll have to check. Rev limiters
 on all are set for 5400 rpm. Try 'em, they work. Berg sells the rev limiting
 rotors, by the way, with several different limits available. They are about
 $30.00.


 My '74 1800 pulls strong to about 55 mph in third, but I usually climb hills
 at 45-50 mph in third gear. '74 and '75 have different gearbox ratios than
 all other years so any comparisons may not mean much. 

 
 I've read a lot of Gene Berg's stuff and have a great deal of respect for the
 work he has down, especially as regards engine cooling. If Geno thinks double
 springs are a good idea for high revs on the type I, I'd probably go with it.
 Doesn't he say you need a counterweighted crankshaft too? &lt;for high revving
 engines, that is&gt;


 Best regards, 

 Dave
