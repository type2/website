Subject: Propane fill-up
Date: Sun, 28 May 95 21:32:07 EDT

Today; we went to fill up the BBQ and Westy propane tanks at Superior
propane in Ottawa. The BBQ tank was no problem; but the fellow could not
get the nozzle to fit the Westy tank (this will be our first fill-up). The
problem was not the nozzle itself which was the right diameter and thread but
that the &quot;protector plate&quot; below the tank prevented the right &quot;angle of
attack&quot;. These are big nozzles used to fill up taxis. I have two questions.
a) has anyone else had this problem and b) does anyone in Ottawa know of
a place other than Superior that fills tanks? 
Thanks in advance.

BTW has anyone ever used their BBQ with the Westy tank - in other words is
there an adaptor that would allow the two to be connected?

Thanks again- David C.
