Subject: Help,Remote isolation PSI Sending Unit,VDO Oil Pressure Gauge

All gauges(volt,oil temp, oil PSI) in, but need to isolate PSI sending
unit. Its to large to fit between the push rod tubes on the engine. I
bought one of VDO's Remote Hose ADP.Kits part #150 752 made for the VW
vanagon (Right!).Basically its a rubber brake line hose (1/4 or 6.33mm made
in USA). Fine, but you need a special tool to put it on! One end of the
line (male), threads into the engine where the stock sending unit goes. The
problem is, the only tool that will work is a 19mm or 9/16 socket.(can't
get to with a box or openend wrench) The problem with using a deep socket
is the rubberline prevents it's use. I looked for a 19mm or 9/16 deep
socket with a hex end so I could drill out the end (where a 1/2 or1/4 drive
inserts) and pass the rubber line through it and tighten up the nut/line
with an open end wrench. These type of sockets or made for spark plugs but
can't find one that 9/16 or 19mm.Any one know of a tool that would work? I
have seen the post about using copper line with pipe thread adaptors to do
the same job without using the remote adaptor hose kit from VDO. But would
you not run into the same problem of tightening the fitting/tubing
attached? Suggestions please.
