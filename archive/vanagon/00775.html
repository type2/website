&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; On my '78 bus there's a fan over the motor, in the engine compartment that
&gt;&gt; is used for the heater.  THis is controlled by a little box on it, that
&gt;&gt; has 5 or 6 leads, and a little plastic harness plugs onto it with all the
&gt;&gt; wires on the harness.  Well, I think it's broken (actually pretty darn
&gt;&gt; sure), but the local VW dealer wants over $60 Canadian for the part, and
&gt;&gt; no one else in the city has it.  Help, does anyone have a spare one they'd
&gt;&gt; sell?
&gt;&gt; There's a few numbers on it (part numbers?) one of them is &quot;211963141A&quot;, 
&gt;&gt; and there are 5 connections, labled:  J,B,A,M,31.  And another number:
&gt;&gt; &quot;R601.108&quot;.
&gt;&gt; I don't really need a heater, but if I could get the part cheap enough I
&gt;&gt; would like to get it. 
&gt;&gt; 			Thanks,  DAN.

&gt;This is so typical of cars in general these days.  They really have the
&gt;car buying public by the Gonads with parts replacement.  No small wonder
&gt;people end up buying new cars sooner than they should have to.  Fortunately
&gt;there are still wrecking yards where bits and pieces can still be had.
&gt;If no one else wants to, I'll take a trip out to my local Pick-n-Pull
&gt;and see if one can be found.  I suppose your wrecking yards are still
&gt;under several feet of snow. ;)

Thanks Steve, got one for free from a friend, but that you very much for
the offer!    DAN
 
PS: We haven't had snow for a while now, today it's 20 C, and sunny, I'm
not sure what that is in Fahrenheit, but I'm wearing shorts.
