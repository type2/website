it's bad enough that the 71's and 73's quietly let slip their hold on the
lead, to be taken over by the 85's and 87's ... but now, suddenly and without
warning, Hordes of Oil-Burning Savages from the Realm of Otto-dom have
descended upon us with their tortoise-like pace and their oh-so-much-more-
fuel-efficient-than-thou attitudes!! :) and they all seem to be 1982 models!!

what's happening, people??

&lt;oh, mama, can this really be the end?
to be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?&gt; :)
