Subject:      Re: 30 fan fuse or circuit breaker

 usually it's a good idea to disconnect the battery before doing
  just about everything. i'd like to hear what shop it was
  i'm in maryland also, aside from the wiring harness how was the
  quality of the body work. another thing i have noticed is that
  many times body shops don't go through the trouble of disconnecting
  the ECU before doing welding, this could potentially cause damage
 later
