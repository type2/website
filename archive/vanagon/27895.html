Subject: RE: Midas or not


Any reason not to use Midas for a new muffler on an '87 Syncro? I'd consider 

doing it myself, but I have no garage and it's a bit nippy right now. And
every time I've messed with exhausts, the dang bolts break off. Plus, if I
get Midas, it's the last one I'll have to pay for. They want $250 for the
complete job.


Midas mufflers are excellent, and last a LONG time.

But the pipes they use to attache everything to, are trash, and rust
out very quickly. And --surprise, surprise-- the pipes aren't covered
by the lifetime warranty! One year, I believe, which is about how long
they last.

I had a Saab that I took to Midas shops in three different states.
Workmanship at all three places, was lousy-- burring left on sawed-off
pipes, clamps where they should have welded (lowest part of the car,
didn't take long to knock it off), leaking joints.

YMMV. I hope.

Now I take my cars to Midas for the free checkout, and then to another
shop for the work.
