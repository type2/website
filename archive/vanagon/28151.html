Speaking of VW's and T&amp;A...

Tina New, the perpetual bikini contest winner and Silicone Wonder Child,
had a bit part on Married With Childred last night.  She got to slap
Bud.  (Hey, I never forget a pair of.... shoes... like that!)

So, if history does repeat itself, she should be appearing on 
Melrose (gag, spit, choke, barf) Place (hack, gag) anytime soon.
