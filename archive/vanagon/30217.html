Subject: RE: Reinforced Snow Tires


&gt;but it wasn't until the spring when I
&gt;got four new michelin MXL reinforced's, that I realized how much better
&gt;the reinforced tires are -- major improvement.

Tom,

What do you mean by this?  I am facing my first winter with my new (used) '90
Camper and have been reading with interest winter driving and tire tips that
have been on the list.

I currently have some pretty badly worn tires all the way around and am saving
my pennies to buy some good winter M+S tires.  Should I be looking for
reinforced side walls too?  If so, why?

Do you think all four, or can I get by with just two?  Everyone's opinion seems
to differ on the subject.  Some people say the Vanagons are really great in the
snow just the way they are.  Other opinions say that they are &quot;Nose heavy&quot; and
that snow tires on the front and chains on the back are necessary.  Its hard to
guess the right way here.

I have to admit that I want to take the bus skiing so I'm tempted to go all out.
But I know I could use the $ for lift tickets if I could get by with some all
season solution.  Plus, I live in an apartment so I really don't have a place to
store the tires during the summer.
