Subject: 1980 Vanagon automatic

I am a new-comer to this Vanagon Web page. Have acquired an immaculate
1980 Vanagon with a noisy engine that requires disecting and it appears
that listed information will be very usefull.

&gt;From some of the info. you have listed, you reference a Bosch Gasoline &amp;
Injection products catalogue. Where can I get a copy - earlier edition
would do.

Look forward to hearing further from you
