Subject: Re: abbreviations



&gt;thanks gerry- maybe we need a FAQ (i know- hypocrite, hypocrite!!) for all
&gt;of these more obscure acronyms.

I can only second this idea. Here is my contribution, shamelessly stolen=20

&gt;
&gt;There has been some renewed interest in internet/usenet abbreviations and I=
=20
&gt;notice another list has been added to the info/comm directory. The two=
 lists,=20
&gt;namely, internet-acronyms.txt and usenet-acronyms.txt pretty much overlap.=
 In=20
&gt;the interest of clarity I have combined the list in my original posting=
 with=20
&gt;the list in the usenet-acronyms.txt posted by Daniel J. Hofferth. Perhaps=
 this=20
&gt;list should replace both of the previously mentioned files. Also, the file=
=20
&gt;should be called internet (or usenet) &quot;abbreviations&quot;, not internet (or=20
usenet)=20
&gt;&quot;acronyms&quot;. Acronyms can be spoken as a word (e.g. NASA) whereas=
 abbreviations=20
&gt;are just the letters (e.g. BTW). Some on the list *are* acronyms of course=
=20
&gt;(e.g. MUD, SNAFU) but most are not. This seems picky but someone pointed=
 this=20
&gt;out to me the day after I posted internet-acronyms.txt.

&gt;For those newcomers to the internet who are confused by terms such as IMHO,
&gt;BTW and RTFM, the following is a list of commonly used abbreviations. If=
 you=20
&gt;read the digest long enough you will probably come across all of these.=
 Please=20
&gt;note some of the abbreviations are for sayings in less than polite language=

&gt;I didn't make them up, I'm just explaining them.
