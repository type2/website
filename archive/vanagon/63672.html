Subject: RE: gears for syncro 16--tall tires

Instead of looking for ways to spend lots of money on experiments aimed at 
lowering the value of your vans,  why not try a simple approach?  If you want 
a 31.5&quot; tire, go to a 15 inch wheel,(think Mercedes or Eurovan).  Then you can 
use a 235/75-15XL or a 31-10.50/15 tire for your 31&quot;.  Spacer can be made to 
increase clearance between the tire and the control arms.  As for the gear 
ratio, tire diameter does effect torque, however the distance traveled per 
revolution is determined by the circumference. This is the proper way to 
determine gear ratio needed.  It may also be feasible to replace the 4th gear 
instead of both ring and pinions.  This would be a relatively low cost way to 
change the final drive ratio.  As for using stiffer springs and shocks, this 
are only beneficial in competition type situations.  When on uneven terrain, 
whatever flex the suspension does not provide has to be taken up by the 
chassis.  Jack up one wheel and note how the doors no longer fit properly.  
Want that to happen as you drive through the woods?  I can see taller springs 
for increased ground clearance, but be careful changing the spring rate. 
Anyway, that my 2 cents for the day.

Keep on dreaming'

Is that all their is to it?

Now all we have to determine is how narrow a 31.5&quot; tall tire would have to
be to fit in the wheelwells with the 16&quot;/sawzall/plastic-wheelwell setup
without bumping into other suspension components, such as springs, etc.

Thomas, are you telling me you don't know this off the top of your head?

If so, then its on to the microfiche, to study what parts to order to change
ring and pinion to 6.14.

&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;
&gt;straight ratio 6.13/4.86 x 25&quot; = 31.5&quot;  yeeehaw! that ratio is for
&gt;TD-16&quot; which is worst case, poor power + big wheels, wonder if it can
&gt;break 55mph?   cheers, tim
