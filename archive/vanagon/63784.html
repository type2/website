Hi all:   Has anyone had a problem with power locks as follows? If I
unlock the drivers door with a key, the lock opens then quickly relocks.
If I get the door open while unlocked the lock will just go up and down 
until I close the door then it locks and stays. If I pull both front
door locks up at the same time, they will stay unlocked (and unlock the
rear doors as well) until one of them gets pushed down then they all
lock and it acts as I first described. The locks worked well until all
at once they started acting this way. I havn't a clue. Thought I'd ask
the list before I started pulling my hair out trying to figure out what
It's doing. Thanks
