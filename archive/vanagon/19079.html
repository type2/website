Subject: Re: I'm going on a trip, what should I check?

&gt;        My wife and I will be going to Maine (and back) in our 71 camper on 
&gt;June 22.  It is 800 miles one way, and I was wondering what I should bring, 
&gt;and what I should check.  The only thing which is bugging me about the bus 
&gt;is the frozen #4 plug.  It has been in there for who knows how long, and I 
&gt;plan to run it until the plug fails.  Does anyone have an idea of how long a 
&gt;plug will last in a 1600?  I've put almost 2k on it since I installed it in 
&gt;late April, and have had few problems.

Hi Chris!

We're bussing from Connecticut to Tennessee starting Thursday in our 71
Westy.  We're bringing along spare CV boots/grease, fuel pump, fuel hose,
generator brushes, manuals, points/condensor, plugs, accelerator and clutch
cables, generator belt, precious automotive fluids and tools, tools, tools
for that remotely possible engine pull somewhere on the Blue Ridge Highway. 

I'd do a routine maintainence before leaving--adjust valves, change oil,
check timing etc.  Checking my maintainance records, I've used the same
plugs for as long as 15,000 miles (Bosch (nonplatinum) W8AC).  I checked the
gap at intervals over the 15,000 miles but it didn't vary significantly.  Is
your plug crossthreaded in there?  I can't offer any advice for quick fixes
as I usually opt for the long, painfully anal repairs that entail removing
and disassembling everything.

I wish you a fun, safe trip with no repairs!
