Subject: Thing? ........hmmmmmm

I recently saw an add in the Sacramento Bee for a VW Thing.  Being in 
need of a project car (too early for boat season) I called to find it is 
of unknown year, running.  Unknown engine type/last rebuild.  Body is 
straight (no rust she says as she seemed to pause for a slight bit) and 
is currently primer grey.  The owner also has a new top, but hasn't 
installed it yet.  As for the interior, it seems to be missing a back 
bench and needs to be redone throughout.  The vehicle is being driven on 
a daily basis.  So whats the price?.......  asking $2300.  Seems kind of 
high, but I have no idea on pricing these things (no pun intended) out.

HELP!....

Any ideas out there?  
Hows the availability of parts for these guys?
