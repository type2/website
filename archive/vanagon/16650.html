Subject: Re:  Non pop top bay Westy questions

&gt; Something I saw today has me wondering, now I know Westy
&gt; did fairly common non pop top versions of bay window Buses,
&gt; certainly till '70 or '71, all the interior pieces and often
&gt; a hammock in front, but when did they stop offering these.
&gt; I saw in a junkyard a genuine Type IV engined, large tailight,
&gt; large bumper, high front turn signaled, Westy.  This was origional
&gt; all ID plates etc and looked to probably be a dual carbed '74, and
&gt; no pop top.  I had never seen one this late before, did they do
&gt; some while they were switching from the front hinged to rear
&gt; hinged roof? are they uncommon or I am just ignorant to them?
&gt; Also did such conversions still receive the reinforcing belly
&gt; pans, etc. as there hardly seems any need for them without that
&gt; big hole in the roof, if they did it would be easy enough to add
&gt; a pop top if desired I guess.
&gt; 
I had a '75 non-pop top westy, that I removed the interior from. It was
the old style interior. Yellow vinyl, in a orange and white bus.
