Subject: Re: linkage problems?

&gt;
&gt;
. If it will not
&gt;shift out of gear (1st) but the clutch releases when pushed in, could this be
&gt;a linkage problem?? Or is it the trany.
&gt;
                YES to both, but might no be too too serious! If the shift 
lever moves properly, and you can see the motion all the way through and 
into the transmission housing working OK then it might be a worn selector 
bar just inside the 'nose cone' of the tranny. The shift rod piece that 
sticks out of the tranny about 3 inches fits into a small rocker arm inside 
the nosecone. This arm rocks to shift from 1 to 2 gear or 3 to 4. It also 
slides back and forwards to select which two gears are available ie.1+2. The 
flanks of the rocker arm wear down and just won't reach far enough to engage 
a gear. If you disconnect the shift linkage from the tranny you MAY be able 
to select another gear, 2nd. by hand. This is a better gear for cruising the 
strip than 1st! still not great.
        If this seems to be the problem see if you can remove the nosecone 
with the tranny/motor still in the van. Support the tranny on a jack, remove 
the front mount and let the motor/ tranny droop SLIGHTLY until nosecone 
removal is possible. If not, then drop the engine/tranny in the usual manner!
        Once you get out this piece, either replace it with NEW, or get it 
WELDED back up (preferably hardfaced, see your local good welding shop) then 
ground smooth. Welding is essential, DO NOT BRAZE!!! it just wears out again 
in a week. A new part is the best option, welding/grinding may cost as much, 
not fit quite right etc. your call.
        How do I know this? I was ripped off by our local VW agency $150.00 
for a tranny &quot;rebuild&quot; years ago. They did the brazing job! Failed in a few 
days. I had made the mistake of taking them my tranny, the didn't get enough 
labour charges I guess. So they screwed me, then offered to redo the job for 
$300.00 more. That was years ago, they went bankrupt, the new agency is much 
the same as the old one.     tim smith
