Subject: Wood interior update =( &lt;help&gt;

Point:
Would someone in LA (general area) know of a specific location for sheets of
5'x5' x .125 White Baltic Birch? I need to possibly drive from Phoenix to LA
and back just to get the wood!

Details/Background:
I have been waiting over a month for information/arrival of the 5' x 5' x
.125 White Baltic Birch which was promised as being &quot;on the way&quot;. I found
out that someone at the wood supplier has been basically lying to me.
Evidentally the fella who told me that it had been ordered used the bosses
name and deceived me.
I talked to &quot;Gary,&quot; the real boss, who was surprised to hear that I was
waiting for the wood as it has not even been ordered yet! He was further
confused when I mentioned that someone called me and had me drive up to the
store only to find that the wood really wasn't in stock. It was 1/4&quot; not 1/8.&quot;
Someone on the unified Vanagon list mentioned that several sources existed
for the stuff (on the shelf) in the LA area. Any help would be greatly
appreciated. I'd kind like to get the bus finished.

Another example of &quot;stuffing the elephant through the hula hoop.&quot;
