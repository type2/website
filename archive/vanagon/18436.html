Subject: WTB: 1971 VW Westphalia, Campmobile, etc.

And yet *another* quest for one of these magnificent creatures!  :-)

Ideally, it will have;
- Documentation of all owners, and services done
- Good to great condition (interior, exterior, underside, etc.)
- No fancy bells and whistles, either. I'm looking for a reliable, *stock*
camper: no suspension, engine, or body mods, please (well, possibly w/ a remote
oil cooler/filter system, but nothing more than &quot;reliability-oriented&quot; work).
- Low miles on a rebulit (hell, even the stock) engine
- All-encompassing care

I know, I know... everyone *AND* their grandmothers are in the market for one
like this, but I'm just being completely honest and totally optimistic! It's
quite tough to just locate one, regardless if it's a gem or not, up in these
parts (New England), so I am willing to travel (w/in a reasonable distance) to
give yours a good &quot;going over&quot;. I've been hunting for a few months w/ no
potential success (aside from one in Rhode Island [Dani was her name] *sniff
sniff* that eluded my grasp due to another buyer w/ a better offer than my own,
JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND!)

Any help/leads would be MORE than greatly appreciated!!! Thank you!

With his heart and mind in the right place,
Scott

E-mail's preferable, as you won't be dropping as many dimes, I hope.

ps- If you're concerend, this is not my virgin outing as I was the proud owner
of a '73 SB for five years in the late '80's.
pps- I'm aware of LiMBO, but have yet to get an answer from their end on the
phone... ???
