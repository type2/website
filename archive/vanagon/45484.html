Subject: Leaving Here

	Hi all - this is a farewell message from the sole Delaware 
listmember. I finally found an engine for my 85 camper (after 14 months in 
the shop), was rebuilt, installed, and runs like a champ - 12 days after 
being back on the road a DE chicken farmer in a pickup blew a stopsign and 
whacked me in the passenger side but good - repair estimate $1600 or for 
parts replacement $3000 - all body work - engine still runs great. I love my 
van but - damn, this evil luck has got to run out soon. 
	On a related note, I'm finishing up my education position with the DE 
National Estuarine Research Reserve/DE State Parks so I'll no longer have an 
email account after this weekend. I just wanted to thank you all for the 
help, information, laughs, suggestions, and untold KNOWLEDGE I have gained 
from the List. Hopefully, I'll be able to get on here occaisionally on 
another account.
	I don't have any work lined up so if anyone has the need to employ an 
environmental educator with a thorough knowledge of Mid-Atlantic wetlands and 
cultural history, lemme know!
	If you're thinking of passing through the area, give me a ring - 
perhaps I can help with arrangements/things to do, etc.
	I'll also be doing some travelling (Minn.,N/S Carolina,etc.) so keep 
your eyes out for a Bronze 85 Westy w/ DE plates - 

Keep looking out for each other and enjoy the ride -
