&lt;&lt;  My sliding door seems fine...but on the highway...it just pops open
 at the rear of the door!   The margins line up well and sliding and closing
 action seem good...but it still pops open.   Im thinking that body sway  or
a
 bump that lifts the sliding door a bit might contribute to the problem
 but?????&gt;&gt;

My 87 does this too.Try adjusting the rear striker post inward a scoot.

  &lt;&lt;The a/c hasnt worked in a 3 years....and was diagnosed as needing a
 new receiver drier.   I was told by the dealer(i hate dealers)  that a
safety
 button popped out on the rec/drier.....indicating the it needed to be
 replaced...?  does this make sense to anybody?    whats this button?&gt;&gt;

The dealer is full of it. The dryer needs replacement because it was exposed
to ai\r ,too long and collected moisture.The most likely leak is the
compressor head plate o rings, esp. the high side...too much pressure blows
them out.

 &lt;&lt; The other thing thats a bummer is that the fresh air fan dosnt
 work.    Defrosting is going to be an issue. ( I live in 
 new england)  Ive been told to check the ballast resistor.....but dont know
 where it is....  anyone out there delt with this component? &gt;&gt;

Resistor is in fan housing, most likely the blower motor has failed if all
wiring is ok(my 84 lunched at 2000mi.) anyhow you have an all day evnet in
store to get the housing out/split, to replace either..Good luck
