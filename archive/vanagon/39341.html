Subject: 	troubleshooting rear locking differential on syncro

I need to know how to adjust, troubleshoot, and maintain a locking rear
differential in my 1986 Westy Syncro.  The Bentley only breezes through it.
 I'm wondering if anyone knows of any manuals or literature about it? 
 Thanks
for the info in advance.

124,385 miles--still going strong (knock on ze vood)
