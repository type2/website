Another mystery almost solved....

&gt; From:   IN%&quot;dushinrg_at_pr.cyanamid_dot_com&quot;  &quot;Russell G. Dushin&quot;  1-DEC-1994
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Aliphatic hydrocarbon, petrolium oil, Dipropylene glycol monomethyl
&gt; ether
&gt; 
&gt; No need for the chem text, this is basic stuff.  Aliphatic hydrocarbons

Basic for you maybe... just so much gobbledegook to me.. 

&gt; could mean lotsa stuff, but here they probably mean a mixture of things
&gt; like pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, octanes, nonanes, decanes, etc,
&gt; etc....basically all solvents.  Petro oil-ahh, lube.  Anything from
&gt; vasoline to 5 wt and back to wheel bearing grease.  Probably a
&gt; crude mix taken straight from the hull of a ship.  Dipropylene glycol
&gt; monomethyl ether.....CH3OCH2CH2CH2OCH2CH2CH2OH, and isomers thereof.

Ah,ha... lotsa C's and H's and O's... CH, CH, CHOO CHOO... Howzat?

I think I finally understand Russell... you did way too many chemicals... 

Well anyway.. thanks for your in-debth anaylsis of fine rust inhibitors and
hair tonic.. I think we can all rest easier knowing this.

(Quick... call the boys down at the state hospital... yeah, yeah, get the
one with the funny hair...)

Cheers!
