Subject: Help - Worth it or not?

 A co-worker referred me to a friend of his that owns a VW shop.  He has a 
'79 automatic bus (aside from the power issues, auto would be ideal for the 
traffic I have to deal with).  He said it was given to him by customer who 
wanted a to trade it for a  classic bug in perfect condition as partial 
payment.  Anyway, Mr. VW said that the interior is &quot;ok&quot; and the outside has 
had all/most rust removed, but is still just primer'ed.  He said that he 
completely rebuilt the engine for the previous owner 20,000 miles ago 
(supposedly a $2500 job).  I asked if he has done anything to the 
transmission and he said &quot;well, there's not much you can do to a trans until 
you see a problem and I've seen no leaks&quot;.  He has let it sit for the last 6 
months with out starting it.  I heard through my co-worker that he was 
hoping to get $2000 for it, but I was thinking of offering $1500 if I like 
it.    I've never owned a bus (never even been in one, much less driven 
one), but did have a '72 bug.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!!!
