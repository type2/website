&gt;
&gt;These come from the latest issue of Import Service, May '96:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Bucking engine, irratic idle and performance:
&gt;
&gt;Several Porches have been seen with torn intake air boots, torn in 
&gt;the area between the air flow meter and the throttle body. This can 
&gt;happen very easily with Vanagons as the engine mounts allow a lot of 
&gt;flex and the air cleaner is firmly fastened to the body.  As the 
&gt;engine rocks, the cracks open up and admit 'false' air which can cause all 
&gt;sorts of nasties.  Check the intake boot very carefully for a split 
&gt;or deep crack.
&gt;
&gt; Yeah  It was torn on the engine that I currently have out of my Vanagon.
Had to order a new one. I think it was 63 bucks.
