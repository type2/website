&gt; 
&gt; Hi, 
&gt; I'm having some problems with my girlfriend's '92 Golf (Digifant II
&gt; Fuel injection), that seem to be almost the same as my Dad is having
&gt; with his '90 Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem:  The car was running fine, we had been on the freeway for ~45
&gt; minutes, then suddenly it started to stumble (as if the fuel were being
&gt; cut off), we turned around and made it home - it seemed to run better
&gt; the faster we went (3500 rpm+), but would still stumble every few
&gt; seconds.  The car is barely driveable at lower rpm.  With the car
&gt; stopped, and out of gear, if I hold my foot on the gas at a fixed
&gt; point, the rpms will vary chaotically from idle to 2500.
&gt; 
&gt; It had done the exact same thing 2 weeks ago, just as we arrived at
&gt; Lake Tahoe (~6000 feet elevation), so I changed the fuel filter (didn't
&gt; seem too dirty), and the problem gradually went away after about 5
&gt; miles of driving.  I thought it was solved, until now.
&gt; 
&gt; My dad's problem:  My parents just finished driving from Pennsylvania
&gt; to Washington State, and they had some trouble going through Wyoming at
&gt; 4000 foot elevation.  They went through the same drill as I did:
&gt; problem happened, change fuel filter, problem goes away, several
&gt; hundred miles down the road (still in Wyoming - it's pretty big), the
&gt; problem shows up again.  Fortunately, they found someone who knew about
&gt; VWs, and he asked my Dad if they had &quot;a resistor&quot;.  My dad said he
&gt; didn't think so, so they explained what it is:
&gt; 
&gt; VW part number 025 906 302 A - costs $95 (in Wyoming).
&gt; This is a wiring harness with a male connector on one end, and female
&gt; on the other that attaches to the air flow sensor (in-line with the
&gt; existing circuit).  The mechanic said that almost all the Vanagons in
&gt; the area had this (due to high altitude?).  My Dad drove the bus until
&gt; the problem showed up, pulled over, slapped this in, and it went away,
&gt; so he's convinced it works.  Does anyone out there have this
&gt; &quot;resistor&quot;, or have any clues?

I don't have it yet, but I can tell you that it is NOT covered under
warrantee :(  (Bad P.R. IMO).  Altitude has nothing to do with the
cause of this problem.  VW explains in their Tech. Bulletin 92-01
that the cause is that &quot;some air-flow meters experience a vibration
resonance of the metering potentiometer wiper during extended constant
driving.  This resonance causes the air-flow meter to supply an inter-
mittent signal to the Digifant ECU.  The ECU will then default to a
&quot;no-load&quot; condition and reduce the injection time.&quot;

It doesn't say how the harness (part No. 025 906 302) fixes this problem,
but apparently it does in most vanagons.

I don't know if this applies to the Golf either.
