A neighbor of mine who installs commercial kitchen counters etc. surprised
me when he told me that copper will never scratch stainless steel. He showed
me a &quot;tool&quot; made from a short length of copper tubing (1/2 or 3/4&quot;dia) that
was flattened on one end. The flattened end was filed smooth and rounded to
resemble the shape of a really dull cold chisel. The edges of the flat end
were filed so that the end could be used to finess the steel surface. The
tool is used to hold or push steel sheets down into corners prior to
seamless welding or slightly polish the surface of the stainless. The length
(6&quot;, 12&quot;, 14&quot;)of the tube is adjusted to suit your taste/hand size.  

I dont mean to infer that this will work on anything other than stainless
steel and caution everyone to test on something non critical.
