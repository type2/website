Subject: my last week, bad news, good news

Hey everyone, thanks for all your good wishes, everything went well on the
way home, i carried 3 people and all this stuff, made it all the way on one
tank.  I also just got back today, and as usual it was a great drive, my 85
is quite a reliable vehicle.. Thats it for the good news, the bad news is
that when i got home and looked under the van i noticed little coolant drops
on my cooling fins... great... leaking head gaskets... actually its just the
right one.  im just gonna wait it out for awhile, im carring a 50/50
water/sierra mix in my van to keep it topped off. 

I also drove that 1970 westfalia that i found for a friend of mine, the van
fills with fumes, the rear hatch seal is bad as is the engine hatch seal,
but im sure the seal around the engine is great, wherever it is (its not
around the engine).  The gas pedal sticks and makes for an adventurous ride.
it needs work, but its still great for 300 bux, hey it runs and has little
rust.. 

hope you all had a great thanksgiving.
