Regarding Joel's post about roof racks:

My wife and I are anxiously waiting for our rack to arrive. I promise to
post a full report upon receipt of the thing. BTW: a local contact called
two weeks ago and offered an original Westy rack that had no wood left and
needed full resto. Price? $400.00 &quot;Good Guy Discount&quot; included. (No
thanks!). I also talked to someone that said that one Cali Big Boy is a
upset that the new racks are &quot;upsetting the market on used racks.&quot; This just
breaks my heart all to pieces! :P Look for &quot;discounts&quot; coming soon to a swap
meet near you.

&gt;these things. welded construction, zinc-plated, u-channel for the wood slats
&gt;(which are riveted). they ain't cheap. :(   SOTO Seal of Approval.
