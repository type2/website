Subject: Inuvik variant... someday

Hi Volkers:

All this talk about Inuvik bus trips got me thinking (takes a lot, I can
assure you 8^)).

I did some geological field work on the Porcupine River in Alaska a few
years back that I intended to include in my PhD at USC.  Wound up too
expensive for the amount of data I got.

Anyway, the idea I had goes like this:  Take a small boat (canoe would
work, but power is really nice because upriver winds can be *awesome*:  We
had a 16' Zodiac) and lots of food and camping gear.  Drive up the Dempster
Hwy to where it crosses the Eagle River (tributary to the Porcupine) plunk
in (get dropped off, so you don't have to leave the bus!) and enjoy the
200+miles down the Porcupine to the Yukon River.  Power comes in really
handy again to motor the 80 miles up the Yukon to Circle, AK, where you get
picked up by whomever is driving the bus.  Otherwise, you could fly from
Fort Yukon to Fairbanks for about $75/person, plus gear (this is where the
Zodiac came in handy, non-collapsible boats wouldn't fit on the plane!).  I
chartered a bush pilot the two times I went, and just flew to the Canadian
border.  It's awesome country, especially in the summer (you'd know about
the mosquitos, too, from your Inuvik trips).

I couldn't possibly go, myself, for the next few years, but someday....
