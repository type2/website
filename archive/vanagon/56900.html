Subject: Re: Long range fuel tank for vanagon?

Joel added:

&gt; - Oettinger in germany sells a 100 liter tank. but won't sell it to 
folks
&gt;   in the u.s.&gt;    if your 86 is a non-syncro, get the syncro 18-gallon tank and install it
&gt;    over the transmission (in that &quot;empty&quot; space). gravity feed to the &quot;main&quot;
&gt;    tank..............
&gt;    that would give you 34 gallons of fuel. :)

Joel, your message arrived as I hit the 'send' button in response to 
Jon's input.  I'm in Germany, so the Oettinger export problem is no 
problem.  However, 2 tanks and 34 gals does appeal just a little bit 
(like lots) more.  Nice to know I'm not totally off the ball with 
this &amp; I'll keep you posted with progress...

Thanks,

Rich.
