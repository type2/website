Subject: 1963 bus stuff

Well, the restoration is moving right along, and I've noticed a strange
(to me, anyway.) thing on my bus-it has a 36 hp engine. Now, I really 
didn't think much of it when I bought the bus-and my local VW 
enthusiasts didn't either, I suppose, but in the piles of stuff I got
from Joel (THANKS!!! It's really neat stuff!!) my engine must have come
out of a 1960? [The number is 5137231 for the curious.] Now, is this
a common practice for the earlier VW's? I am the second owner of this
bus, and I know that (read:good reason to believe) that the bus is 
all original and has never been tampered with, and it's condition
reflects that. 
Next up : the headliner question. There is a rather nice (well, it was
probably still nice in 1973, when the bus was parked.) `mouse fuzz'
headliner in it. I have had conflicting reports about pretty much 
everything there is on this poor bus, but Oval's (a pretty nice VW
shop up here near Seattle. Will give info. if anyone asks.) anyway,
I've been told alternately that this isn't/is original equipment,
so I'd like a scoop on that. And also where to get some if it is 
stock. Also, I'd like a 3/4 center seat. (ha ha.)
