Subject: Re: Water-cooled Mexican bus info, anyone?

 I'll begin by saying that i don't know much about later busses. However,
I've heard that golf engines are an easy swap into Diesel Vanagons. therfore,
you wouldn't think it would be that much more to drop a passat engine in. Or
heck why not a VR6. 
	Anyone out there know for sure if you can swap golf engines
into a diesel Vanagon?
