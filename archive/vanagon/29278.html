Subject:  87 syncro found - help

syncronauts:
a friend of mine (pretty good friend who donated 2 days of his time to
help me replace clutch/pilot bearing when neither of us had done it
before) has located an 87 syncro w/blown rod/hole in the case (his
words).  neither of us is familiar w/the 4wd setup, so what should he
look for/ask about?  is is very clean and well maintained, with a brand
new clutch.  we're also wondering about how much he should be willing
to pay for it in this condition, and how much he might have to spend to
get it going (unfortunately he has no garage and it's pretty cold here). 
please respond directly if you can/care to, as i'm on digest mode.  thank
you.
