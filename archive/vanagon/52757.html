How about the cabins in Lakeside village, on Huntingdon lake. I used to know
the guy  who ran the resort, Steve Sherry, I will call him if Huntingdon Lake
is OK. This is at 75000 ft above Shaver LAke behind Fresno. There is a ski
resort next to the Lodge &amp; I think the road is snowploughed in the winter.
