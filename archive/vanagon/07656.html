well ... i made it around chicago one winter in my 71 bus with 'normal' tires
on it.  i do NOT recommend it, but it can be done. you just have to be very
very very careful about the other cars (who are NOT being very careful!) and
pay close attention to the condition of the roads and parking lots. :)

might be a good idea to get some extra rims from a junkyard and put a set of
snow tires on the back. ;)  but the weight distribution of the bus helps a
lot in snow ... until you have to panic-stop.

oh yeah. chicago is FLAT. so if your environs are bumpy and/or hilly, these
words may not be worth the paper they're printed on. ;)
