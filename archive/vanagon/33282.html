Subject: Re: How do you e-mail Tom Fornam? (Forhan)

There is no way to email Tom Forhan. I've been trying for months. Every 
once in a while we get mail through, but it's pretty ugly.

&gt; &gt; that lets him send mail to me, but I can't send it back?
&gt; 
&gt; If you find out, let me know. :) (I've been trying for a couple of weeks,
