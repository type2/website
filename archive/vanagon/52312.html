Subject: towing with a waterboxer 1.9
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 15:29:09 -0500

Any advice/opinions on the possibility of towing a bug on a trailer with my
'83.5 wasserboxer 1.9 vanagon (recently replaced head gaskets)? The trip
will be about 650 miles through some pretty hilly terrain, from western PA
to Cincinnati, Ohio.

thanks,

tony
