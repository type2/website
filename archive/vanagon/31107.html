Bill,

Is it so that the '71 T2 heatexchangers originally
came with the same operating-levers as a Bug, the ones
that pivot on a welded-on shaft, on the sides of the
heatexchangers that are closest to the center
of the car?

If so, i understand that you think the heatexchangers
you have know look strange, i think you have post
'71-'72 ones for the 1600 bus engine, which was still
used outside of the US after that date.
The heater-cable-tubes were relocated to serve both
the 1600 and the T4 engines. The levers of the 1600
heatexchangers had to be changed accordingly, and were
replaced by a small lever on the opposite side of where
they were located before. The levers are approx. 2&quot; x 10mm
and have a small hole to connect the heatercable hardware.

Some Danish manufacturers produce heaterboxes that have
both this late T2 lever and the &quot;Bug&quot; lever and shaft.

Is this the answer???

Cheers,

Brian.
