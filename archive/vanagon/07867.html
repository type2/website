&gt;        Wouldn't a later Beetle locking engine cover latch do
&gt;this job? The single cab I'm hopeing to buy has shot locking

&gt;use Beetle parts as replacements...

it worked on a 71. can't say about anything later. but i THINK the only
thing that was changed was the hinges (long about 1975 or so).
