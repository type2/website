Subject:      FS: 87 Westy

I have a non-running 87 westy for sale.  I'm not exactly sure what is wrong
but all popular opinions think that it is a &quot;broken piston&quot;.  The body has
rust and damage but the interior is in excellent condition.  Camping
amenities worked last time I used them, new propane tank is needed though.
 Canvas is in great shape etc.  The van has 170k miles and has had lots of
love as long as I've had it.  My wife and I have had many fantastic journeys
in it.

If anyone is interested in buying it please feel free to call me at (617)
659-4735 (Norwell, MA).  The van is probably a great buy for a mechanically
inclined individual or someone looking for a parts van.  I am now starting
the hunt for an 89 or newer Syncro Westy in mint condition to replace her
with, wish me luck.

Peace,
Rob
