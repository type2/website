Subject: Dust

	Volks,
	A word of warning. I'm moving out of the house I lived in
for the last 10 years. 10 years storage in my garage has left a 
film of wretched dust on everything- I'm having to wear latex gloves as 
I pack and clean it out. Just *handling* things results in a terrrible, 
bitter, taste on my tongue. Probably a mix of regular old dust, old paint 
dust from sanding and wire-brushing, rust-dust ditto, polishing compound 
flung from the buffer, brake dust (shudder) and goodness knows what all.

	Conclusion: Don't generate dust in your storage environment.
I'd go further and say put everything in a zip-loc and pack those
into uniform size boxes (easier to stack) labeled as to contents.
Copier/computer-paper boxes with lids rather than flaps appear more
dust-proof and will be prefered by me from now on.

	Next house/garage I have, I'm also going to put in dust traps 
on the vents, and paint the surfaces around the vents with glossy
paint that can be cleaned.

	Its spooky to touch stuff and have that affect your taste a
few minutes later. obviously its absorbing through my skin.

	Bill
