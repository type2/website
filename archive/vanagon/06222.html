Well, tomorrow it's off to Santa Clara for two weeks for a DEC class, so I'll
have to read up on when and where you all decide to have the West Coast
Gettogether when I get back.  Actually, I'll have to take an additional week
off of work just to catch up on all the list email that my machine will have
hoarded for me while I was away!  I hope I don't bust a disk or something!

Anyway, &quot;see&quot; ya all later.
