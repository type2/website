Norman unashamedly replies (regarding the EuroVan):
&gt;welll, that's good, you just keep thinkjing that, and the five or siz of us
&gt;this list will just enjoy our little secret...

RIGHT ON!!!! I've driven T4s here and in Europe. In Germany T4s are
all over the place....in all varieties. I remember hearing how
&quot;breadloaves&quot; were not REAL VW vans in the late 60s...when the
&quot;bricks&quot; came out....Gaaawwwwddd!!!...they, too were not like
real Type 2s...

So in a sense, the T4-not-a-real-VW-van crap is nothing new! I agree
with Norman....I too have owned more VWs (over the past 25 years)
than I care to remember...my EV has been trouble free, it handles
well...it isn't tail happy like SOME VW vans  (only kidding guys)..
and you can spit on the roofs of other minivans as YOU pass them!!!
