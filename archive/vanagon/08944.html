&gt; 
&gt; Greetings!
&gt; 
&gt; I have this interesting challenge --
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '71 bus with the brake fluid reservoir behind the front 
&gt; seat. It has been leaking at the seal between the bottle and
&gt; the tube. The seal, which looks like a cross between a bushing
&gt; and an O-ring, is toast (well, more like goop). I haven't
&gt; found a replacement through the usual channels (WCM, &amp;c). I
&gt; was thinking about wrapping the base of the bottle with string
&gt; or duck tape or something, then putting the clamp back on.
&gt; Anyone been through this before?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

I have two '71 busses. The best replacement is a new one, which I
have never been able to get. Next best is to go to a wrecking yard
and find a good one there. The guys at the wrecking yard won't charge 
you for it since they will think that its just junk.
