Subject: GEX update

     I now have 5000k on the rebuilt motor from GEX (1600SP) and #4 is a 
     low 105 PSI.  Motor is HARD to start, cuts out while running, runs 
     rough, blah, blah.  So, I called GEX on friday and explained that this 
     head was cracked around #4 valve guide when I got it but on the advice 
     of GEX at that time and my own impatience at getting the bus ('66 
     standard/camper) on the road so I could put my Moto Guzzi down for 
     extensive repair, I put it together and crossed my fingers.  Stupid!!  
     Before installing I photographed the cracked case and sent pics to GEX 
     with a cover letter.  
     
     Ok so here we are 5000k later and the motor comes out again (I'm 
     getting good at this!).  I'll pull the head tonight and inspect and 
     send back to GEX regardless, due to the crack.  I'll also be looking 
     at rings, etc.  My hope is that I can get a decent head this time and 
     that I won't have to mess with htis again for a long time.  While I'm 
     waiting I need to replace seals in the tranny and rebuild the 
     starter/solenoid.  Stay tuned for the story on how GEX handles the 
     problem.
