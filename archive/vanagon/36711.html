Subject: re: '82 Diesel Smoke

Anybody got quick n' easy way to test for a bad injector
on an '82 Oil Burner?  On a cold start Jake (The Oil
Burner) lets out a large cloud of blue smoke and runs
rough.  After running a few minutes it clears up and
warm he runs fine.  I suspect a faulty injector,
however, I don't have the special VW tool that Bentley
recommends for testing.

Try loosening one fuel line at a time at the injector - if you can 
loosen one of them with no difference in the idle, then that injector 
is bad.
Note: You will only need to loosen enough to release the fuel ressure 
- don't loosen too much!
