Subject: re:Austin Vee Dub bad motor

To tell the truth I have not had any thing done by Austin Vee Dub, but I
have see the new motors out in the lobby/waiting room, and they look
fine to me, of course this assesment comes without looking at anything
but the outside of the case, so assume what you will.  Personally I have
not heard anything bad about them from anyone, except that their used
part prices are a tad high.  Probably due to their being no other VW
wrecking yard in the Austin area. They build racing engines for their
racing team, but they use a Sirocco, I'm sure due to the class the car
is in.  Not drag racing, but oval track racing.  Everytime I have gone
there though every bay is full, and there are a large number of cars in
the lot waiting for work.  Porsche's, Audis, VW's, BMW's and the like
both vintage, and new.  I think he just got a bad engine.  Then again
this could be regular, like I said I have not heard anything negative
about the work they do.

FWIW,
