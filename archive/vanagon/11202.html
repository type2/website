Subject: First Syncro Screw-up: Oil seal

Ho folks... my new toy just blew a gasket, the dreaded O-ring on the oil 
cooler. It was -20C this AM, apparently -25C overnight. Dumped the oil in 
the drive, but the problem is that the oil light was non-operational and I 
drove for about 15 minutes! The dealer is paying for the tow, and the seal + 
labour since I've only had the thing for 2 weeks, and fixing the oil light. 
So.... those of you with late model vanagons in cold areas, next time you 
change the oil filter, change the ring to a new style one, might add 10 
minutes to the oil change, &lt;$10.00 parts!   down and out,  tim s.
