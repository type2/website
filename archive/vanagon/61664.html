Subject: Hey...I'm Back!



Just a quick note as I'm getting life back together at home after the German 
trip...

Went to VW again, got the VIP treatment...agin...our tour guide owns a 72 
double cab...and isinto VW vans...he may be joining the list (finally 
someone from VW AG on the list...)

I'll have details later...but here's one piece...got a VW Saver's 
book...full of stamps from 1944 while I was at the museum...neate piece of 
VW history!


Talk to you later!

Ric
