&gt;&gt; Gerry, 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My wife is business editor at Newday/New York Newsday here in NY. She is
&gt;&gt; preparing a package of articles on the internet and is pestering me to come
&gt;&gt; up with the name of someone who toils in the background running a listserve.
&gt;&gt; They want to interview the person, ask what it is like, and feature the
&gt;&gt; person in a pacakge of articles on the interent. 
&gt;
&gt;Ooooo Gerry, watch out! he might be setting you up to be on Oprah! ;)
&gt;
&gt;Oops!  Maybe you want to be on Oprah? Geraldo?  Oh my God! Jenny?  ;p

Yeah, but just look out for Connie Chung ... no telling what kind of
