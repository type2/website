Subject:      cup holders! getchur red hot cupholders rycheer!

On Thurs, 14 Nov 1996 Tom Forhan (for whom &quot;pop-top&quot; has an ENTIRELY
different meaning!) said these words (or words to this effect):

&gt;Hey! Stop laughing! This is serious!

&lt;sniffle, choke, Guffaaaaw, Chortle!&gt; :)

&gt;My buddy's Carat came with all the original cupholders broken or
&gt;removed, and I'd like to get four for the Syncro Westie as well.
&gt;I saw the thread in the archives about OEM cupholders
&gt;being seen at K-Mart or Wal-Mart. Well, around here, no luck.
&gt;(1) Anybody seen any lately?

see below.

&gt;(2) Where?

see even belower.

&gt;(3) Are they really identical to the VW unit, or just similar.

just similar. possibly better, in one case.

here's the old info from my &quot;what have i done to my bus&quot; file:

drink holders: the best i have found are from Herringtons ...
1-800-622-5221 order number B832 = white/vertical, B833 =black/vertical.
they have one that fits horizontal surfaces, too, but i couldn't make
much use of it. now the gotcha: they are $9.95 EACH!  yeah, well, i
tried all the wal-mart and k-mart ones, but they just wouldn't hold a
big enough drink cup ... like they hand out at the Mickey D's and such.
so, after wasting money for several years, i broke down and bought the
good stuff. these holders expand to hold almost anything.  i put them in
the back for the second and third seat people. in the front, for the
driver and passenger, i used some Rubber Maid K-mart types that have a
drink holder molded in with a ? holder ... sort of a two-compartment job,
with a rubber flap to fix the thing into the window glass. i permanently
fixed mine to the plastic heater cover (in front of the gearshift) with
some more stove bolts (short ones) ... one drink-holder-thing on each
side of the gearshift (leaving room for the gearshift to move around).
not much of a reach down to get/put a drink, and it doesn't interfere
with my right leg when driving.

&gt;(4) Anybody actually buy one and know who the manufacturer is;
&gt;maybe I could contact them to find someone retailing them?

ok. back into the StoreRoom of my house. :) out with the examples of the
yet-uninstalled cup holders (gee. i've only got NINE in my bus. i need at
least TEN more to beat that dufus GM minivan (it has 17 cupholders. 17.
that's SEVENTEEN! for a 7-passenger van. go figure).

the expensive one has on it's outer cover &quot;Expandable&quot; and on the back
&quot;made in Hong Kong&quot;. on the inside is &quot;ITC Marine&quot;. the difference with
with this one is that it has &quot;jaws&quot; to grip the cup/drink and those jaws
can widen/expand about an inch to accomodate containers of about 3.5&quot;
(90mm) diameter. it has steel spring clips (to keep the jaws upright) and
six pre-drilled holes in the back for mounting. availble in vertical or
horizontal mounting. costly, but nice.

at Wal-mart, in the FISHING area (of course. why, it's not save to drive
an automobile while drinking!!), is the $2.97 (your price may vary) one.
quote:
&quot;Flip-Down Drink Holder
* High-Tech Plastic Construction
* Ideal for Boats, RVs, Vans and Other Vehicles
  Stock NO. 62128    Made in America
    Another Quality Product from
      WJB Industries * Clear Lake, Iowa 50428 * USA&quot;
it is approximately the same (mounting) size as the others (roughly 4&quot;
(10 cm) square), and has the six pre-drilled mounting holes, but uses
plastic spring clips to hold the cup-holding-ring. in fact, i wouldn't
call it a &quot;cup-holding-ring&quot;, because i don't think a coffee cup would fit.
the enclosed-circle holder is about 2.8&quot; (75mm) in diameter and will hold
only a soda/beer can or small bottle.

the next candidate was also bought at Wal-mart, but has on the cover
&quot;L S Brown Company&quot; on the cover. when opened, it's identical to the WJB
one above.

i recommend checking out the wal-mart ones, but i think you'll find that
the more expensive one is that much better. just my opinion. ;)
