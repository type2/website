Subject: Re: Dormobile talk

i am now that much more knowledgeable about the Dormobile operation. I
think what I like the most are the Westfalia interiors, but am preferential
to the Dormobile elevating roof, and the fact that the actual roof opening
is much wider. I imagine it would cost a few bucks to send over all of that
stuff! How much is a 1000 quidin terms of American$. Is a quid worth the
same as a pound or what? BTW what would an Ambulance Spotlight/mirror go
for in the UK?I am looking for one like the one that was on the bus on the
cover of the November issue of Volksworld

&gt;
&gt;     &gt;i guess you are you lucky dude. do you ever come across any Dormobile
&gt;     &gt;stuff, a way over there across the pond?
&gt;
&gt;     I had a friend who just sold an early ('60) Split Dormobile for 1000
&gt;     quid. I've seen Dormobile advertizement fliers in with magazines at
&gt;     swap meets. And did you know, that Dormobile fitted their elevating
&gt;     roof conversions to the Devon camper conversions. My mate has a '67
&gt;     Devon with a Dormobile top on it. For this reason you think you see
&gt;     quite a lot of Dormobiles, but most turn out to be Devons. Dormobile
&gt;     also converted Fords Transits, Bedfords, and Dodge Commers.
