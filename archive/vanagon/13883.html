&gt; I am down to the last couple of things for my toolbox.  I decided to 
&gt; buy 3/4&quot; drive sockets and breaker bar for the big stuff.  I don't 
&gt; plan on being anywhere near a Sears store with my bus much of time so 
&gt; this is my piece of mind.  Sears does not sell 6 point sockets for 
&gt; these big sizes.  They do sell 12 point.  I just got off the phone 
&gt; with Snap-On customer direct order line and this is what I heard.

Doesn't Sears sell 6pt impact sockets in the large sizes?  I coulda sworn
I saw them there.  Big, black, manly looking things.   Those Snap-On
prices are outrageous, of course.

Oh, I just got back from Solar Electric, to buy aluminum frames for the
solar panels I bought a coupla months ago.  At Martha's request, I took
a closer look at the Golf cart batteries they had:

Brand:		Trojan
Weight:		61 lbs.
Volts:		6
Amp Hours:	220
Price:		$59
Color:		Maroon
Cycles:		750+  (I guess this is the number of times they can be
			charged and drained before they lose a certain
			percentage of their capacity... ?)

Their glossy flier claims that their batteries last longer than the other
major brands of golf cart batteries (Exide GC-4, US2200, Exide 2200).
