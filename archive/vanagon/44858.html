Subject: oil filters 

The engine, 2.0L is ready to be installed this weekend finally! I wonder if
I can use a larger oil filter then whats called for and if it would add any
to the oil capacity/cooling.Is there a filter of choice among list members?
I've always used Wix with engines that I've cared about.
