I'm new to the list, and I suspect strongly this has been discussed here
before, but... have an '88 Vanagon with its first cancer spot - right where
the rubber seal around one of the side rear windows meets the body. What's
the thing to do here to stop its progress? I'd always thought of painting
flowers on the rust spots as they develop, as a kind of &quot;ten years from now&quot;
project, but alas, the bus has different plans for my life now. 

Thanks in advance,

MB
