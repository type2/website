I have a VW related question for you all.  :)  The garage at my new 
place is perfect except for the lack of electricity.  I bought a big 
extension cord to run out there from the house.  So far all I plan to 
run off the thing are lamps.  All of the power tools I have right now 
are cordless.  So, before I go burn the place to the ground:  Can 
somebody tell me how many 100 watt bulbs I can plug into this cord?  
It says &quot;Use this medium capacity outdoor cord with garden or power 
tools and appliances that require 10 amps or less.&quot;  It also says 16 
AWG on there and down by the little UL sign it says 10A 1250W 16/3 
SJTW-A.  It is 100ft in length.  I recently consolidated my household 
with my SO so I have about as many lamps as I could want for plugging 
in out there.  Last night we pushed and turned the bus sideways in 
there so I have more room at the rear for getting the motor in and 
out.  All I need is to order a few more parts and get myself a little
work bench built.  Thanks for any help with the electricity thing.  

Jim
