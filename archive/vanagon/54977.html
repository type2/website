Subject: '85 heater switch

My front fan control switch in my newly purchased 85 westy is jammed in
the third speed position and the fan does not work. If I jiggled the
switch the fan would come once in a while. The heat and defrost is fairly
ineefective without the fan  specially in this frosty part of NH.
Anyadvice would be appreciated.

Mike

Heading for the west coast end of this week!
