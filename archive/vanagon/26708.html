Howdy,

	Put a new sunroof cover on the bus yesterday.  A lot easier than
it was the first 2 times...

	I'm too tired to go into all the details right now, but if someone
wants the procedure, I'd be happy to detail it.

	The only bummer was one of the nylon riders for the head bow
broke, which lets the front bow come off the rail.  I'm not even gonna
try and find a new part, gonna buy a chunk of plastic and fab a new one...
	
Thom
