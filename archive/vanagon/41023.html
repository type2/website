Subject: mystery single-cab splittie revealed!


Well, I haven't seen that single cab since I last invaded its space a few
days ago, but today I finally discovered the owner. We had a nice talk,
I told him about this list, he and a friend admired the V6anagon, and my
day was complete.  :^)

He's Jeff O'Neil,who works at GI as I do... send him some Email at
joneil_at_gi_dot_com, and invite him to join the list! I already made my pitch,
and he sounded interested. And his friend, Ken Bloch, is actively searching
out the VW clubs in San Diego. Write him too, at kbloch_at_gi_dot_com -- these
guys are definitely wannalisters!

Jeff's ride is a '61 single that he's restoring. He says that dual-port
engine in it has a burned valve and a newer swingaxle tranny-- synchro
in all four forward and the reverse, and has pretty good freeway-cruising
gears. I don't know if he meant the gears came that way from the factory
(as I believe the later swingaxle trannies did), or if they were added
later a la Transform. He found the car at a friend's place in central CA.
It was backed up against a dirt embankment, which had then fallen and
engulfed the rear end of the car, and was left that way for two years
until Jeff rescued it. Jeff's now had it for about 10 years.

Drop them a line and say Hi... I'll bet they'd get a kick out of it.
