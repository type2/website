Pardon my jumping in here, but a serious note.

If you are in Moose country, avoid at all costs
running into one.  They are much bigger and heavier
than a deer and all that weight is a whole lot
higher off the ground, on pretty spindly legs.
A half ton of meat centered 5-6 feet off the
pavement is *not* something you want to plow
into.

This is no joke.
