Subject: re: [vanagon]   PS rack rebuild: HELP

Had my 84 GL rebuilt in 1989 and it's still working.  My local guy knew of 
an outfit in Philadelphia that did them.  First he removed mine shipped to 
Philly, they did the rebuild and that was it.  Total cost was in the 
$600-$800 range.  I'll get the paperwork on it and see if I can get the name 
of the folks in Philly.
