Subject: 72 Bus steering question

    Hi.
    
    I recently purchased the third '72 Bus in my life (don't know why 
    I always end up getting a '72)
    
    I love it except for one problem, the steering on it is way looser 
    than I'd like.  It's actually kinda dangerous this way. I know 
    they're not the most nimble things in the world but sometimes I 
    need to make a quick turn.
    
    Can it be tightened?
    Can it be tightened by me?
    
    If anyone can provide me with some help on this, I'd be very 
    grateful. 
    
    Thanks in advance
