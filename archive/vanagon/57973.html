On Thu, 3 Apr 1997 12:57:38 -0600 you said:
&gt; I'm upgrading my front seats to the newer armrest style and I've
&gt;noticed that when they are in the door doesn't close because of the
&gt;door's arm rest. On the vans that these seats were intended for, did VW
&gt;just leave off the door's arm rest, or was there a narrower/different
&gt;one that I'll have to track down?

nope. they just left the damned arm rest off the door. :( which really
kinda ticks me off ... cause it was &quot;just right&quot; for my elbow. and the
fold-down armrest isn't. not only that, but you have to fold UP the
armrest to get out!! (or suffer the breakage of the armrest ... yup. if
you put ANY weight on the armest getting out, it tends to crack the
little metal attachment point at the swivel/rear. $130 for a new one! :(

&gt; Warning, don't eat the Twinkies if you accidentally spill oil on them
&gt;unless of course, it's synthetic oil which has a very similar chemical
&gt;make-up to most Hostess snack cakes.

oh, sure. NOW you tell me!!

&gt; If you respond to this post, it should be about seats or oil filler
&gt;doors and maybe even Twinkies, but absolutely NO SPAM! Twinkies don't go
&gt;with SPAM! Yuck!  :)

?? no Spam with Twinkies?? how about Twinkies and sardines?? or Moonpies
and Aroh-see-co-colas??? :)
