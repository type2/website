&gt;   What exactly is a deep cycle battery?

It's a battery that is made for use with moderate loads over long
periods of time (as opposed to very high loads for short periods of time
like a standard automotive battery).  They have thicker plates than
regular batteries, which help them withstand being drained.  Even so, to
keep from killing a deep cycle battery, you should not drain it more
than 75% of its capacity, and recharge it as soon as possible.
&gt; 
&gt;   And, while we're on the subject, what is the recommended cranking 
&gt; amperage for a Vanagon with no extras (tv, etc.)?

I assume you mean amp hours.  Cranking amps is only useful (well, sort
of) when you are talking about starting the vanagon.  Just get the battery
with the highest capacity you can afford.  It will last longer.
