Well, I have run out of time, so I ended up swallowing my pride and 
calling a tow truck to take the van to a place for work.  My original 
plan was to goto TNT foreign Car Parts in Seattle because my dad knew the 
owner.  However, the AAA tow truck guy convinced me to stay in town and 
go to Scotties, a local &quot;Custom 'Bug' Specialist&quot;.  I got there and tried 
to talk to scottie, but he just didn't seem to listen to me, and I was 
getting bad Karma vibes, so now the van is on its way to Ivan up in 
Seattle.  I'm still not sure what it might be, and I'm even looking into 
plane tickets for the trip home.  I've found storage for the bus for the 
summer, but it would still be nice to drive it home.

Anyway, Ya'll keep your fingers crossed for me that it will turn out to 
just be timing or something nice like that.  I should find out tonight.

nerve wracking, I tell ya.

P.S.  You were right, who ever asked about the hydraulic lifters - it's a 
'77, not a '78.... nerves...
