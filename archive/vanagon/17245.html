Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff

     In reply to your concern over antennae hanging all over your bus, I know
of a co. that may be of some help. Dakota Digital out
of Sioux Falls, SD makes a really nifty under-dash antenna that is reportedly
much superior to ext. antennae, and way tidier to install. Dakota is known
mostly for their high-tech instrument
panels, mostly for hot rods, but they offer a huge supply of other
electronics that are, again, reportedly of top knotch quality. I am planning
to use some of their products in a hot rod project of my own, but VW owners
can benefit from therir exprtise as well.
I may even update my 71 Westy if their stuff turns out to be as good as I've
heard. Caution- this stuff is a little bit pricey, but you get what you pay
for!
