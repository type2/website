&gt; Hi to all VW enthusiasts,
&gt; 
&gt; I've hear lots of bad and a little good about the Eurovan.  

Than you're listening to the wrong folks.  Darned good vehicle.  Excellent.

&gt; But... I am looking for something between an RV and a Conversion Van so that
&gt; I can travel in some comfort and not have to stay at motels and eat at
&gt; restaurants all the time.  About the only vehicle that I know about that
&gt; fills this requirement is the VW EuroVan camper.  I was talking to a dealer
&gt; yesterday who mentioned the marriage of Winnebago and VW in the latest
&gt; camper incarnation.  Does anyone know anything about these puppies.  Like:
&gt; how long have they been made?  are they any good?  cost?  availability of
&gt; used ones?  should I buy new if I can afford it??  If they used to be lousy,
&gt; are they better now?  etc., etc.?

the Eurovan (or T4 generation of the VW van) has been made for 4 years.  
International success.  Winnebago has only had the camper conversions 
for a couple years now.

&gt; 
&gt; I am especially concerned about their reliability, as this has been a huge
&gt; question about the Eurovans.

Well mine is extremely reliable.

&gt; I really need some help here, so any and all advice on the specific question
&gt; of the VW/Winnebago vehicle or potential solutions to the general question
&gt; of what is a good vehicle to buy for &quot;camping&quot; would be greatly appreciated.
