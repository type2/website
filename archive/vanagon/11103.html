So Bill Abbott mused:

	Someone posted that they'd been on digest mode for a day and
missed everyone- I can definately relate! Wish I didn't have to choose
between getting my job done and staying on top of this list. People
on this list are wonderful and I'm proud to know you all!


And I say:  This is a decision you all have to make?  Jeez, better get
a terminal at home or start looking for a new job!  :)
