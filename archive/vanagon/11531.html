Subject: Job interveiw

&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever went to a job interview drving their breadloaf?
&gt;
I did.  Guess what kind of job I tried to get with my '74 beast?
Yup.  A *car* salesman.  :-)  Needless to say, they just looked
at me funny and said,   &quot;Sure, we'll CALL you.&quot;.  I suppose I
should have tried at a VW dealership and not at a big 3...
