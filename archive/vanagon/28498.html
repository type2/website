Subject:       Re: Help: Crew Cabs are worthless

&gt; I'd like to have some input from y'all as to what you think these might be 
&gt; worth, based on bus prices in your area, or crew cabs if you know of any.  I 
&gt; can't help but feel that almost any driving vehicle is worth $1000.
&gt; 
&gt; If I get some responses, I'd like to use them as evidence that Opie really 
&gt; does have some worth (it's bad for his self-esteem).

Insane.  They shaft ya everywhere.  

A friend of mine got broadsided in his '67 Westfalia a month or so 
ago (at low speed).  First of all the cop didn't cite the girl(!!!) 
(because he was turning onto private property(!)  The insurance 
company of the girl that hit him wouldn't pay a penny, saying the 
vehicle was too old, and that she was not given a citation.

Concerning Opie, I would walk in there, tell them you are going to 
have the dent fixed, and send them the bill or a letter for your 
lawyer.

There is a _perfect_ double-cab in the next city down that is at 
least worth $4000, so Opie's worth something!
