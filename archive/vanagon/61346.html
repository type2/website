Subject: Re: water in my exhaust..

&gt; Can tell you stories about leaking heats on an aircooled ... dripping oil 
&gt; onto
&gt; the heat exchangers ... got big smoke behind the van ... caused following 
&gt; drivers to
&gt; flash lights, thinking the van is burning ...

I almost set my Scirocco on fire once putting oil in it (at a gas station
no less - what a disaster that would have been.....)  Anyone want to
know how you can destroy your car putting oil in it?

&gt; Or do you get air bubbles into the cooling system? Watch the high pressure 
&gt; tank
&gt; when the engine is heated up.

Another way to check is to hold an emmisions tester sensor wand over the 
radiator opening while the car is running.  The tester will tell you if 
there are exhaust gasses in the coolant.
