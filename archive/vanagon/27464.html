&gt;      wastegate springs, and still maintain outstanding reliability. These
&gt;      puppies run hot, however. The turbo is watercooled (many auto turbos
&gt;      are just out in the air), and the intercooler sucks up so much air the
&gt; 
&gt;      Tom F.
&gt; 
FWIW, I once considered a turbo Audi transplant into my Quantum Syncro,
and at the time, I was under the impression that most of the early
Audi turbo units from the 5000 series were in fact air cooled.  A
VW mechanic friend who owned one heavily modified though for higher
boost, ran it 150,000 with no problems, his opinion was that the key to
turbo life was oil and more often overlooked AIR filter changes
regularly, like every 25k.  He put over 200,000 on the origional turbo
I believe with never a rebuild, reseal or anything.  On the engine
as well BTW.
