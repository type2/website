Subject: EV Stalling?

(Please... no &quot;I told you so's&quot;)

My brand-new (300 km) EV Winnebago has stalled a few times when slowing to a stop.  The engine was 
not hot, and not stone-cold.  I have the 5-speed manual.  Does anyone have any ideas, other than zooming 
back to the dealer for some of that non-pareil warranty service?  Is there a computer or sensor problem 
brewing?  Am I just a worrywart?

Second question - at idle, the engine sounds a bit diesel-like, or clattery, on and off.  The tach is steady.  
Any comments?

Thanks a lot.
