Subject: 96 Transporter brake servo

My 96 model 2.4 diesel is now just over 12 months old.  In the last three 
months the brake servo has failed as of today, twice.  The first time it 
happened was mid March and the Van had approx 20.000 kms. it now has 
almost 28.000 kms.  It was taken care of under Warranty the first 
time and I expect the same to be the case this time.  What I'm writing 
here now for is, has anyone heard of this happening to other 
Transporters(Eurovans)?  I've had the save thing happen to my 81 Passat 
diesel at the end of last year.  I ended up getting a second hand one 
from the wreckers ($600 inc. tax. was out of my reach for a new one).  
Anyway while at the wreckers having a chat about why I was getting an 
Audi servo for my VW they mentioned that servos wheren't a high volume 
sales item.  Also that servos were normally very reliable.  So when I 
have two new ones fail I have to wonder if there is a design problem with 
my van.  
Any ideas?
Reece
