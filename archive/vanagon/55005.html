Subject: RE: diesel heater/cooling problems (again) 

I would check for the following:

 - low coolant level
 - air in coolant lines
 - bad thermostat

&gt;Greetings, I'posting to the type 2 list as well as the vanagon one in 
&gt;order to tap the minds of ALL the mechanical geniuses out there.  Sorrry 
&gt;for wasting any bandwith on non-aircooled problems.
&gt;Last week I had a problem in which my van was overheating while the 
&gt;interior heater was not working. I assumed I had an ice blockage due to a 
&gt;weak antifreeze/water blend. The van was defrosted in the garage and was 
&gt;running alright afterwards.
&gt;The past few days the van warms up with the temp gauge reading 1/4 - 1/2, 
&gt;however the heater blows only cold air.  After driving about 5-10 min it 
&gt;starts getting warmer, only to cool down shortly. 
&gt;I never had a problem with the heater previously, in fact, after only a 
&gt;few minutes of warming up, it usually blows nice and hot. anybody know 
&gt;what the problem could be?
&gt;
&gt;TIA
