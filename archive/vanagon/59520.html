Subject: '87 has noisy lifter

The 2.1l in my 87 syncro has a noisy lifter. When the vehicle sits for a few
days (I drive it about every 3 days or so) the lifter ticks for a couple of
minutes and then quiets down. Today the lifter ticked loudly until the oil
got up to operating temperature (~180F), then it quieted down like always.
I'm using Mobil 1 synthetic15W50 oil (and have been for over a year now).

What should/can I do about this?
