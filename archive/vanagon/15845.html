So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, i know: don't look a gift horse in the mouth. but this bothers me,
&gt; if it was going down, then i'd know something was wrong and i'd had some
&gt; ideas. but this! i don't think i'm driving that much slower. i don't think
&gt; i'm driving any less in town. the ONLY thing i can connect to this is that i
&gt; started using those Bosch triple-electrode plugs just about the time the mpg
&gt; started going up a little. ??? coincidence?? maybe the plugs just suit my
&gt; driving style better? maybe the old plugs were that much wrong??
&gt; maybe they've done something to the gasoline around here? maybe my bus is
&gt; really a Democrat?? ;)
&gt; 
&gt; arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!! old folks hate change!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i'm getting up to 21-22 on the highway now. and 17-18 in town.
&gt; 

Umm, you're worried about a .2 gallon per mile change?  I would think this
average difference could be attributed to just the kind of gas you use.
You must fill your tank very carefully Joel.
