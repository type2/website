Subject: Off topic - 1 Polo and 2 Audi A3s

     Folks-
     
     Meant to include the following in my &quot;The Daily Rambling&quot; trip report.
     
     Returning to New Mexico yesterday, chanced upon a caravan of Arizona 
     &quot;Manufacturer&quot; plated vehicles at a gas station just 4 miles south of 
     Blanding Utah.  Now some of you who travel the southwest deserts know 
     what this means; vehicles intended for the market are frequently 
     tested (sometimes in &quot;stealth&quot; trim) in the vast desert areas of the 
     Southwest.
     
     Now I'm not sure about the Audi A3s, but I know the Polo is not on the 
     market in the US.  FWIW, the Polo is comparable in size to the 
     smallest Geo, so I imagine it could be sold here.  This one had a 
     European sized indent on the rear hatch for the license plate which 
     would likely be changed if it turns up here someday.
     
     The A3s looked pretty cool - I've heard of these, but never seen one, 
     lending credence to my thought that they are not currently on the US 
     market, but I'm ready to be corrected.  It's comparable in size to a 
     Golf III, but appears to have a wider stance (optical illusion?).
     
     Some of the drivers were obviously of &quot;Teutonic&quot; origin; some not.  
     Talked with the guy driving the Polo who confirmed that they weren't 
     testing it for the US (then why have it here, I thought?)  I mentioned 
     the &quot;List&quot; and conveyed some of the comments y'all have made about 
     wishing for a TDI Eurovan (he said he has one at home in Germany).  I 
     gave him my best &quot;Gute Fahrt!&quot; and they took off (got some photos, 
     though).  Also travelling with was a Passat Wagon with a VR6 motor 
     (nothing new, right?)
