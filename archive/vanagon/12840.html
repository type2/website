Subject: Re: New cargo doors...

&gt;Markus,
&gt;I visited my local boneyard in Potsdam NY... 
&gt;and the doors were for the pre-'62?  Anyway, they had the hinge near the 
&gt;top of the door.
&gt;He was asking 100 bucks a door.  They were still in factory primer.
&gt;If anyone is interested, let me know and I'll dig up his number.
&gt;
Please e me the address &amp; number, Thanks
