Autobody Junkies:

I have a paint question:  Anyone used PPG Delstar?  I've been using
Deltron, and was helping a friend of mine with a Chevy Blazer, and he
decided to go with Delstar, and it looks pretty good, and he has only had
to go thru half the work I did - its a single stage paint, but it
still looks really good.  Its also less than half the price of Deltron!
I coulda saved about $300 on paint!  Oye!

Any feedback on results, experience, etc with this are appreciated.  I'm
going to use it to do my window frames, cause I don't want the high film
buildup you get with the Deltron.

Thom
