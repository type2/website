Subject: Re: Bus Semaphores



&gt; The book I have, &quot;VW Transporter 1949-1967&quot; says they stopped using
&gt; them on the Euro busses in '62, which would mean that Euro busses
&gt; never had nipples... nipple lights.

Thom,

	My '62 RHD bus has the large oval rear lights and 'nipple' or 
	bullet indicatiors as well, i understand that my bus is very 
	early 1962 but i thought in this country they stopped using 
	semiphores in 1960-61.
