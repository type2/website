and here's WHAT you are hiding in (from?):
  

  70 Bus  12  
  71 Bus  31 !!!!! 
  72 Bus  20  
  73 Bus  31 !!!!! 
  74 Bus   9  
  75 Bus   3  



  WOW! The '73s have caught up to the '71s !!!
  
  
  And Sami, things are not looking good for you in the '74 vs. '75 category.
  Maybe it's time you got a pair of Solexes...
