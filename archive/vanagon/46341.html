Wouter,

I have to take strong exception to this.  The emmisions laws in the States
are not 'SH*T'.  They exist for a very good reason.  Yesterday, looking
across the valley where I live, I could not see the mountains 10 miles away
through the haze.  A large amount of that haze is automobile pollution.

Emmisions controls are good and necessary.
