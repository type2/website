Subject:  65 Unearthling



I keep reading things slightly differently than written.   I think this is my
subconcious mind playing tricks on me.

well, may I respectfully suggest Unearthling as a name for the new 65?
what do you think, Mike?   People say those old Volkswagens are WIERD!


good luck with the bus,
clara
