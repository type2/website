Subject:      Anyone Turbo'd Their Non-Turbo 1.6L Diesel Vanagon?

Turbo-Diesel Volks,
Sorry for the bandwidth, but Diesels are Vanagons too! (Did I say that
backwards?) Looking for anyone who has added on a turbocharger from a
1.6 TD to the non-turbo 1.6l diesel in our Diesel Vanagons? Anyone
-know- anyone who has done it? I am contemplating this and have
questions unanswered.
