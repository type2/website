John -

Try calling Scott Foss in San Rafael, California.  I don't know the
number, but think it is in information.  If you can't find it, let
me know.  He does this particular conversion - vanagon diesels
to the turbo charged variet

I've spoken with him on the phone, and he seems quite knowledgeables
about diesel engines as well as this particular operation.

Good luck..
