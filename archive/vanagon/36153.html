Subject: Re: Syncro Mudflaps Trivia

The Westies I've seen have a (fairly) big mudflap just behind the drivers side
front wheel well. This is to protect the propane tanks which is
just behind. The one big mudflap easily falls off (at least mine seem
to). Maybe the PO added the two front mudflaps on your Westy, but
didn't bother with the back. 

I've added small mudflaps to all 4 wheel wells, but they are not
nearly sufficient. Harry Yates has some info on how he made better
ones on his web page. Ideally the wheel wells should be a little
wider, so the tire is completely *inside* of it. Even with my narrow
tires (195/75R14) and mudflaps, the sides of the bus get sprayed. Is there
some kind of after market modification kit to widen the wheel wells?

/Martin (and '82 Westy, which got all the mud washed off today and
a shiny coat of wax, while the neighbours Lumina was jelously watching.)

PS What do you use to wax your pop top? I have been using regular car wax.
