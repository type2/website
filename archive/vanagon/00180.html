Subject: 16&quot; gearworks version of Vanagon

Does anybody have ANY information on the so-called 16&quot; gearwork  version of
the Vanagon. This is a special edition of the Syncro with 16&quot; wheels and
special gears to match. All the parts fiches refer to 16&quot; parts and 14&quot;
parts. We all have 14&quot; parts/wheels.

I think I want to convert to the 16&quot; version so I can put on bigger tires and
change the gearing but I don't know what the effects would be. I have a
german language picture of the 16&quot; model and it looks like they have VERY
skinny tires. Perhaps the big wheels don't really fit and you are forced to
use skinny tires to achieve clearance with the body of the vehicle. I am ever
in pursuit of parts for better off-road capabiity of my '90 Westy Syncro.

If someone on this list can speak German perhaps I should type in some of the
gobbilty gook on the 16&quot; model so we can see what it says about how it
differs from the 14&quot; vehicle.
