Subject: Re: Brake booster troubleshooting


I forgot to mention in my last post to be careful with the check valve
that is directly attched to the top plate. Whoops, I just remembered that
it is not directly attched to the top plate in the non-vanagon diesel.
Anyway, this is a caution directed to the old smokies, if you crack or
break the connection between the metal top plate and the check valve...its
not replaceable..you have to get a hold of another complete pump. Or jury
rig an inline check valve from a golf/rabbit/jetta diesel and somehow
connect the line to the little circular flange on the top plate.

Excuse the rambling

Alistair
