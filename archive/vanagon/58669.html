&lt;&lt; Any suggestions on where to get one of these for my '91 Westie? Price
 range?
 Thanks,
 Cris. &gt;&gt;

I came across a junkyard that was parting out a Carat, it had the grey velour
rear facing jumpseats, and they said 100 a piece w/ all hardware.

anyone interested?

I'll try to find the number.
