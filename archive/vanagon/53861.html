Subject: More Heater Blower Problems

Last week our highest speed on the heater fan (front) motor quit 
working and now none of the speeds work.  I looked in the Bentley manual 
and could only find reference to Diesel and air cooled heater fans.  My 
manual is 1980 through 1985 Vanagons.  My camper is an '85 built in '84. 
What should I be looking for?  Is this too a resistor problem as in 
HEATER BLOWER RESISTOR REPLACEMENT&quot; previously on this list page?  If 
anyone has the same manual can they point me to the correct page number. 
Thanks,
Wendy
