&gt; I have three engines (two in the bus, one in the living room) built on cases  
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I don't know about the rest of you but you can have those fancy 
Porsche sixes and turbo Subaru motors.  I want this guy's setup.  
Maybe you could hook them up so if one dies you could just run on one 
to get home.  Please forward all diagrams so I can get started.  :):)
