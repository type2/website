Subject: Re:  Ignorant glow plug question

The cold start cable on you diesel Westy is actually a timing=20
advance cable.  When the vehicle is turned off, you should not be=20
able to pull the knob out, at least on mine you can't.  It is used to=20
keep a cold engine running smoothly when the air temperature=20
is cold outside, until the engine warms up a little. =20

Where I live, the outside temp is about 10=B0 F right now, so the=20
starting procedure on my '83 diesel westy is as follows:  turn on=20
key and wait till glow plug indicator goes out, start engine, pull=20
out timing advance knob till the engine idles smoothly, then=20
push the knob back in.  It actually advances the timing to allow=20
the van to run better.  I have also used this at higher elevations=20
like 6,000'+ to help with initial cold starts.

You don't have to sit at an idle until you can push the knob back=20
in.  I usually take off down the road and after a minute or two of=20
driving I then push it back in all the way.  The mechanics at=20
Volkswagen explained to me that the timing advance does=20
nothing when the engine rpm is greater than 2500, so driving=20
with it out is no big deal.  I don't know about that.   I like to push=20
it back in and forget about it.  I'm just happy I haven't had to try=20
the block heater yet.
