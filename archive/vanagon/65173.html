Subject:      Poptop gasket

I noticed some discussion about the replacement pop-top gasket available from
the Bus Depot. (These are the one with aluminum internal clamps rather than
the factory steel (i.e. rust prone) ones.)

It is true that the replacement seal is not as tall as the factory one. I've
only put the front on on so far, but have noticed that because the seal is
not as tall as the factory one, it does not fit snug against the roof of the
van. There is probably a 1/16&quot; air gap at some places.

While I was initially concerned about this, I've noticed no adverse effect.
It is not noticiable unless you get within a few inches of the seal.  I do
really like the idea of having a seal that will nut rust and put ugly orange
stripes down the side of the van though!
