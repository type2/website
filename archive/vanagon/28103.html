&gt;My &quot;new&quot; '87 Westy syncro came with chewed up tires which I need to replace

Mark,
If you plan to do much on these logging roads and want good dirt grip I'd use
the
BF Goodrich Radial All-Terrain tires size 27LT8.5-14 (27&quot; diameter, LT=Light
Truck, 8.5&quot; width, 14&quot; rim diameter) should fit your wheels at least if
they're alloy.  I've been told that these are too wide for the narrower steel
wheels - you migh want to ask a reoupable tire shop about this.  I've got
these tires on my Syncro and they've been great.  I was initially concerned
that these would have too much road noise, but I really haven't noticed much
if any more than the passenger car tires.

Good Luck,
Jim Davis
