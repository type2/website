Well, 
	I put in a new starter to day.  Took about 30 minutes, all told.  I
think my old one was the orioginal, or close to it - it has screw-on
terminals!  I'm wondering if I should NOT take it back as a core, but
$15 bucks is a tank of gas...

	The bus still doesn't start, even after all that.  I think the battery
is DOA and the charger I have seems to be about as effective as tits on a
canoe.

Until next time...

Thom
