Subject: Back from the dead

I just spent the last three weeks in Vanagon and computer Limbo.  First my 
Syncro started acting up with a nasty valve knock that took me several days to take care 
of.  I thought I would be ready for the camping trip sponsored by Tom, but that didn't 
happen.  Also, I had to watch house for my parents while they went on a two week sailing 
trip. (I had to monitor and medicate a diabetic dog twice a day so camping was out.)  I 
spent the time rebuilding my Thing which once again is road worthy and getting my Volvo 
and boat in tip-top shape...the camper suffered from neglect, but I'm going to remedy 
that now.	
	About this same time my computer in Maryland (I was in PA and computerless) 
crashed and by the time I had it up and running with a new motherboard (still under 
warranty) I had 1700 messages on my mail server which refused to give them to me. So I 
had to delete everything.  I still can't connect with my server, so I don't know if this 
will post.
	My goal now is to try to regain control of my summer and enjoy my remaining 
seven weeks of vacation.
		
	What's been happening since I died?
