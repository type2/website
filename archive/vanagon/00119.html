Was that option available?  The Bozobus is a double-double-door Panel, but
I don't think I've ever seen that option on a bus with windows.  The body
twist might be pretty rough on windows, but then again, they'd be in the
doors, wouldn't they?  I tried to install some windowed-doors in the
forward positions on Mr. Bozo to improve visibility, but the doors that I'd
rescued from a '66 Westy had upper hinges of a different height from the
'61.  Still have those doors...

The Bozobus does have sheet metal welded on (factory) to the bottom, so
that you can't see any of the frame members between the jack points.  I
think this was to stiffen the body since it has a big hole on both sides.
