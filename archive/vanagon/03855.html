Subject: EuroVan Winnebago Test Drive

&gt;   we have a GL with the automatic, and a miniature daschound named oscar 
&gt;   meyer. the dog may not have much to do with the van, but he is important 
&gt;   to us.

We have a 106-lb. Yellow Lab named Pongo, he is important to us :-)

&gt;   i would think that the term &quot;adequate power&quot; would be fitting ONLY for
&gt;   those of us that know what the previous &quot;normal&quot; amount of power for a VW
&gt;   van is.  
&gt;   i find myself with the throttle wide open when getting onto the freeway,
&gt;   and a few other times, and that's more often than i am realy comfortable
&gt;   with. 
&gt;   but i must say that at those times, there is actualy a fair amount of
&gt;   power. enough to be considered &quot;adequate&quot;, but far from the 396 gas 
&gt;   guzzler V8 i am used to.

The engine of the MV especially good torque at low rpm.  However, this probably
makes it a bad candidate for automatic transmission, unless it's a tigthly
coupled one.  I have the 5-speed EV GL, and am very impressed at its
acceleration and climbing power.  Let's see: 396 means 6.5 liters.. the
EV has the 5-cyl 2.5 liter engine -- imagine what it would be like if you
had two of those in tandem :-)

&gt;
&gt;   and speaking of gas guzzling, 10mpg in the city, and 15mpg at 65mph on 
&gt;   the highway is not close enough for me to what was posted on the window 
&gt;   sticker when we bought it.

Really?  this is for the EV?  We are getting 23+ mpg highway (average
speed of 70 mph) and 19+ city.   This, and the power you are talking about
when pulling onto highways suggests there's something wrong with the 
engine or adjustments.  Have it checked before warranty expires!!!

&gt;   &gt; &gt; EV Winnebago is not for us. We'll hold for a EuroVan MV Weekender. There is
That's what we decided also...
