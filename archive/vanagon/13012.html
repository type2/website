&gt;and that means getting the Westy out of storage! First thing though is to
&gt;crawl underneath and find out exactly where the clutch fluid is leaking. I

well, i just had to replace my slave cylinder, so i can shed a little light
here. at the FLAPS, it was $40 us. it was an ATE brand (which is one of the
vw OEM folks), and the original (once removed) was a FAG (which i thought
only made wheel bearings!).

when i first noticed the 'spots' on the pavement, and crawled part-way under
the bus, i thought it was my differential that was leaking ... especially
since the 'spots' were kinda reddish and thick. well, it turned out to be
the slave cylinder, mounted over the differntial, and the brake fluid was
dissolving that cosmoline waxy stuff that was still on the transmission. :(

so ... thoughts for replacing the slave cylinder:
- do NOT fill the new slave cylinder with brake fluid. it squirts ALL over
    you when you have to fit it into position (i.e., compress it).
- remove the REAR bolt first!!! (otherwise, it is a real bitch to get to
    while you are trying to hold the cylinder).
- when putting the new one in, insert the REAR bolt first! up through the
    bracket. use some paper towels or something to hold it up there while
    you put the cylinder on.
- get SOMETHING to collect/stop the fluid from coming out of the tube as
    you move it to one side. the reservoir up front is STILL higher and the
    fluid WILL leak out. i didn't have anything 'mechanic' so i used a
    zip-lock bag and some wire to keep it on. didn't work toooo well, but it
    did help. a little. a rubber plug would have been lots better.
- don't forget to bleed the clutch when you are finished. you'll need more
    brake fluid.

what was leaking? the internal seals on the cylinder were just worn out ...
83,000 miles ... and the fluid was leaking down the shaft and out the rubber
bellows on the end.

the clutch is really hard and tight now ... just like a new clutch. :)
