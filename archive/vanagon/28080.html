Subject: car stereo installation

I put a Blaupunkt Cancun car stereo and 2 4&quot; blaupunkt speakers in the
vanagon yesterday, and it sounds marvelous.  Soon i shall add 2 6x9's in the
walls about the rear deck and a small amp for them.. I reccomend the Cancun,
it fit perfectly and installation was a breeze.
