Subject: Re: external cooler/filter : ...



To All:

The oil contained in an external cooler and filter is considered 'trapped'
oil if it does not drain back into the sump (which it should not).  Replacing
the filter deals with any dirty oil trapped there but it will be necessary to
remove a hose or two and flush the external cooler if you wish to perform a
complete oil change.  This is rarely done except in extreme cases, such as
suspected oil contamination.  The interior of your engine will always contain
a remarkable quantity of trapped oil that can not be removed without flushing
the system.

If the geometry of your external oil cooler allows its contents to drain back
into the crankcase you should probably reverse the hoses.
