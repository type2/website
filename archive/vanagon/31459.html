Subject: RE: raceware vanagon head studs

Patrick,

The phone number for Raceware is 313-946-4477
Their fax number is 313-946-9913.

I've bought a set of head studs from them for a VW
Turbo Diesel and a VW 16V engine.  I haven't installed
them yet so I can't give you any report if they work or not.
I mostly bought them because you can reuse them.
