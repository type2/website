&gt;I was really dumbfounded that when cars come to america they suddenly
&gt;increase their fuel consumption by 20% .
&gt;
imperial gallons to litres; multiply by 4.54
american gallons to litres; multiply by 3.78

BTW, gas prices here (Saskatchewan) are:
94 octane: $1.97 US/US gal ($0.719 Can/L)
91 octane: $1.77 US/US gal  ($0.649 Can/L)
86 octane: $1.72 US/USgal   ($0.629 Can/L)

Our gas prices have increased by $0.08 per litre since January.
