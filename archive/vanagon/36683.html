Subject: Optima Battery fits in Vanagon!

VanagoNUTS,

Yes, I've seen it with my own eyes.  It was in the 1990 Vanagon Carat
belonging to SWATO &amp; LIMBO member from Phoenix, Jim Harvey.  The standard
Optima battery fits in the normal battery position in a Vanagon.  You just
lay it on its side and the battery posts face toward the front of the van.
No need for any work on connectors or cables, the posts are already in the
correct orientation with the positive post nearest the center of the van and
the ground post on the passenger side.  The clamp that usuall holds the
battery down, acts now to hold the battery back under the lip at the back of
the battery box.  Next time I need a battery, I'm definitely getting one of
these.
