Description fits the Winnie version, has a poptop, has single louvered 
window on drivers side, rather confined feeling sitting in rear, IMHO.  Had 
a good look at one at dealer last Dec. The 'full blown' EV Westys have a 
poptop that is almost invisible, roof line hardly altered.  Painted to match 
body. Impossible to tell from a distance until you see the 
seam/weatherstripping crack along the sides.

&gt;Now show me a Westafalia Camper that seats seven.  Get the one you need....

Mine will seat six!, just get a middle seat from 7 seater and bolt in rails etc.
