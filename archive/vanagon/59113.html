Subject: Gas mileage

I asked this a few months ago and didn't get any responses.  I figured it was
because I had just subscribed to the list and it had already been gone over a
million times.  What type of gas mileage should I be getting from an 81
Westy?  I get about twelve.  Is this average?  I know water-cooled's get
close to 20.  Would a tune up help.  I've changed the plugs and ignition
wires, but are there things that could be done to improve mileage.  I am
going to take it to my mechanic for a tune up, but I don't want to if all he
is going to do is change plugs and oil.
