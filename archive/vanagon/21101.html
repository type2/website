Subject: Re: Bus Trannys

Someone said:
&gt; Also, what causes the trans to jump out of fourth gear when it gets worn.
&gt; What parts need to be replaced to fix this. It would be nice to have it
&gt; right instead of using the bungee method, although the bungee method is
&gt; probably much cheaper.

Your right about that. Mine does not jump out of any gears, but it is
getting kinda sloppy (tried the linkage fixes, get better, but
not good.)

When they rebuild the tranny, can the device that prevents downshifting
into first be removed? What is stopping it?
