Subject:       Mild funk

So is anyone else sitting here in a mild funk because they can't go 
on Da Trip?

FWIW, here's what I would bring to help out:

a 12 gallon stainless steel boiling keg with a 170,000 BTU propane 
burner for the chowder/gumbo pot

More maple syrup too! (I make it muh self)

Many bottles of a totally excellent mead (honey based wine, also made 
muh self) for initiating pagan celebrations and general silliness

My wife, who is one of those disgusting musically talented people that 
can play nearly anything.  She'd probably bring her hammered dulcimer and a 
penny whistle.  I'll just listen.

Maybe our kids so they can run around and generally keep us from 
taking ourselves too seriously.  

Good Luck to all,  have a wonderful and safe time.
