Subject: Re: Kingston Bugfest date?

Finally an answer:

The number listed for the Kingston Bugfest never answers morning, day or
night or weekends :-(
Instead, I called the Lake Ontario Park where the meet is to take place.
They have it booked for this weekend on Sunday, JULY 6.

LiMBO readers please take note: the meet is NOT on Sunday JULY 13.
