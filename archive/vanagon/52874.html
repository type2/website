No, definitely not. It was a German Westy, no Reflectors on
the sides. The US military is located in the South at
Frankfurt to Karlsruhe locations, not in the Eifel where
MYK = Kreis Mayen is located.

Most of the US owned cars have US plates mounted, this is
less expensive (I guess) and they don't have to go trough
the biannual cars approval.
