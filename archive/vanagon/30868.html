Subject: Re: Variable temp solder iron.

I've thought about doing this as well, as my 25W for CBs just doen't cut it
for taking care of my auto needs, although I have been using it.  Only one
thing you forgot to mention: What iron are you using with your rheostat?
Did you get a new one or are you just using your 40?

I'm trying to think of a project I saw once that allowed you to see how
much juice you were giving your appliance but I have no idea where it is,
nor the time to figure it out for myself (it had a nice digital display...)


Just curious...

&gt;I have lusted after the Weller variable temp irons for a while now
&gt;but couldn't justify the cost for my limited tinkering and repair.  I
&gt;have 2 irons, a 25W one I use for circuit boards and a 40W one that
&gt;works nice for automotive wire.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is the 40W model just plain gets too hot and scorches my
&gt;flux and degrades the tinning solder.  So, using some cross-platform
&gt;technology from bee-keeping, i now have a variable temp iron.
&gt;
&gt;In bee-keeping, we use a 'hot knife' for removing the wax cappings
&gt;from the frames of honey.  Same problem as the soldering irons-- the
&gt;hot knife gets too hot sorching the wax and honey, even tho it has a
&gt;crude on/off regulating thermostat.  I built a 110V rheostat that
&gt;allows me to regulate temps or speeds on a variety of devices.
&gt;Essentially, it is a rotary lamp dimmer wired to a 110V receptacle
&gt;and placed on a line cord.  Plug the device into the outlet, set the
&gt;dimmer to whatever output you need and the rest is Duck Soup.
&gt;
&gt;Here's what you need:
&gt;-metal 2-gang junction box.  ~$2
&gt;-600W dimmer.  $8
&gt;-110V outlet.  $0.69
&gt;-dual cover plate that has and opening for the 110v outlet and a wall
&gt;switch. $1.
&gt;-3M rubber feet. $2
&gt;-old 3 wire extension cord.
&gt;-metal line cord clamp for junction boxes.
&gt;-a few wire nuts.
&gt;
&gt;Wire the dimmer to control the 110v outlet.   cut off the female end
&gt;of the old extension cord and wire this to the dimmer. mount all
&gt;this in the junction box.   as the old saying goes, if you need more
&gt;detail than this you shouldn't be trying it.  add the cover plate to
&gt;the box and put rubber feet on the bottom of it.  now all i do is
&gt;plug in this rheostat box to an outlet, plug my solder iron or hot
&gt;knife into the controlled 110v receptacle, and crank to the best temp.
&gt;
&gt;This allows me to have my iron on for extended periods without it
&gt;turning to a black crust, yet have enough heat to really do a nice
&gt;job.
