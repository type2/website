I can't remember ever WANTING to see that many &quot;Me too!&quot; messages on a list...

...urrggg...       Me too!     $10

Of course, in addition to being a VW fanatic, I'm also a Macintosh fanatic
- so why not get a cheap used Mac, run Macjordomo, set it in a corner and
not ever worry about the hardware?  That would cost around $500, total.
I've had a Quadra 610 running as an FTP server (with 400 users leaning on
it) for close to four years and it hasn't so much as hiccoughed.

I'll apologize in advance for bringing religion into this ;-)

Thanks Gerry, for all the work you've done.
