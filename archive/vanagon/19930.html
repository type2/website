&gt; Anyone see the shows this past weekend?  Lots of sweet loafs,
&gt; but a lot of splits with missing rear bumpers.  Why is this?
&gt; 2nd set Sunday night was heaven.P?({
As mine is one of those rear-bumperless buses, I would say that it is
just one less thing to take off when pulling the engine. Actually, I
didn't even get one with the bus, so i would probably put one on if I
got one. But then again, I do have to replace that transmission mount
sometime...
