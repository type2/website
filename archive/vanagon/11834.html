WOW! I have to ask: were you the owner when the previous rebuild was
carried out about 30k ago? If I understand you correctly, the engine you
have was rebuilt at 50k and in less than half that mileage you are
looking at a valve and/or ring job (oh what the heck just get new heads).
WhenI see figures like rebuild at 50k and major engine malfunction at
under 100k, my mind starts to wander....for example: the first owner of
our 82 forgot to put oil in at at 50 k. The result? New engine. The second
owners ran the second engine ragged up to 160 k. The result? New engine
(actually a rebuild from GEX). So either you have been stuck with a real
lemon of an engine or.....what kind of driving do you do? DC

&gt; Greetings fellow travellers!
&gt;  Well my latest tale of woe for my money pit [85 vanagon gl with
&gt; 80,000 hard city miles] happened yesterday with my wife driving.
&gt; I'd appreciate any guesses about cause and cost for repait
&gt; you'd like to make.
&gt;  After just a few moments enoromous billowing clouds of oily
&gt; blue ish smoke pours out the tailpipe.There's no doubt about the oil in
&gt; it-wiping a rag around the tailpipe gave plenty on the rag.
&gt; In the cars I've tinkered with, worn rings were common but
&gt; i've never seen something happen like this-boom then lots of
&gt; oil pouring in the combustion chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your opinion !
