The consensus on the list seems to be to avoid tees for measuring oil
temperature. VDO has a dual sender for the idiot light and oil pressure.
For conventional VW engines the best location for oil temperature is
probably the dipstick. This arrangement won't work for the Vanagon and
later bus engines because of the length of the dipstick tube. I have had
good luck with a sump plate sender which requires drilling of the sump
plate (a Porsche plate would be better but tough to locate) but gives an
accurate reading of the oil temp....
