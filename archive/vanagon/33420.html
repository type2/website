&gt; Can someone familiar with this problem post a picture of the
&gt; offending component on the web? I thought we were talking
&gt; about hoses coming loose.  Mine are all clamped down. Now I
&gt; think we're talking about the brass fitting itself coming
&gt; out.

&gt; Thanks! Joe

Sorry, can't help with the picture for the web, but you're
right Joe, it *is* the brass fitting itself.  All the clamps
in the world won't help if the brass fitting slips out of
the carb body itself.  My solution is to tap the brass
fitting in with Lock-Tite on it.  I'm sure someone here can
give a long explanation of the difference between the
expansion/contraction rates of copper/aluminum, what appears
to be the primary cause for the fitting being loose in the
first place.
