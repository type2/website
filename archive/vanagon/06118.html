Subject: '74 brake backing plates NEEDED

Greetings- 
	My '74 Westfalia recently failed PA safety inspection because the 
rear brake backing plates are &quot;rusted through&quot;.  They definitely need to be 
replaced.  My problem is that *nobody* stocks these things.  I've called 
probably a dozen shops from the back of Hot VWs, I tried the dealer, etc. 
Apparently they were a seldom-fail item, and no one makes new ones 
anymore.  Given that most buses on the East Coast here probably are 
suffering from the same problem, I hesitate to waste any time in a junkyard. 
	Does anyone out there have a pair of these floating around gathering 
dust in a garage?  According to the dealer, anything from a '71 to '79 should 
work. 

Thanks, 
--Dale
