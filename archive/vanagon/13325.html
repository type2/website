They stopped selling leaded gas here about 3 years ago.  If you've 
rebuilt your engine since it was new the chances are you have heads made 
for unleaded fuel.  If not, your engine will still last along time on 
unleaded.  My Chevelle still has the original engine, and runs fine.  The 
lubrication that the guy was talking about is the valve guides.  So, as I 
see, the worst you do by running unleaded is wear the guides faster.
