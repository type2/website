     &gt;Be aware.....
     &gt;
     &gt;
     &gt;
     &gt;There is a big scam going on where a person calls and says &gt;that they
     are doing a computer survey from a company.  The &gt;company name that
     they give is usually a big well-known &gt;software company, and they
     usually say that they are doing &gt;the survey because they want to give
     out free software. They &gt;want to know what would be a good time for
     someone to
     &gt;come from their company and install the software on your
     &gt;PC at your home.  They also ask questions about income, etc. &gt;&gt;
     &gt;During their questioning, they find out what time you're &gt;usually
     home, what kind of computer equipment you have and &gt;all sorts of other
     valuable information.  At a company where a &gt;friend of mine works, a
     co-worker of his received one of &gt;these calls, and he was robbed the
     very next day (of course, &gt;when he was not home).
     &gt;&gt;
     &gt;I received a similar call yesterday afternoon. Fortunately, I &gt;knew
     about this ahead of time, and we didn't provide them with &gt;any
     information.
     &gt;&gt;
     &gt;I want to make you all aware of the situation and the &gt;potential
     danger involved in giving out any information like &gt;this over the
     phone.  The people sound very genuine, and &gt;very few people are going
     to question receiving free &gt;software.  I would advise you, however, to
     tell the people &gt;that if they have your phone number, they should have
     your &gt;address (we think they're getting it off the internet), and
     &gt;they can mail you any free software they might be offering. &gt;You may
     even want to tell them you don't have a home &gt;computer. Whatever
     you're comfortable with.  Please don't &gt;give out any information that
     you may regret later. Pass &gt;this information along to friends and
     family members, as &gt;well.  The fewer people they are able to scam, the
     better.
