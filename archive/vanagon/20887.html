&gt;Subject: Vehicle Names

Over the past 30 years of Vee-Dubbing, some of them have had names:

1. '61 Bug  -  Jinx  (because it was - there's a story behind that)
2. '62 Bug  -  Honey (because it ran as smooth as honey - bought it new, sold
it, bought it back, still have it.)
3. '67 Deluxe Bus 21 Window  -  Blaze (because of the color [orange/bronze
metal flake] it was painted below the waistline - bought it new, still have
it after 307,000 documented miles, undergoing third restoration, hope to
finish it before the century's out :)  )
4. '63 Bug  -  Grey Ghost (because it was grey.)
5. '73 Karmann Ghia Coupe - Harvey (Dunno how I came up with that one, but it
fit I guess.  Bought it new, sold it two years later in Hawaii while in the
Army.)
6. '69 Camper  - Ole Reliable (because it was.  If the other Bus was down, it
was always there. I miss that Bus - Not a Westy, it was an USA Conversion
done in Idaho.)
7. '73 Panel - White Elephant (because of the color.  I bought it with a hole
in the top of the case for $250.  Became a rolling storage shed for over ten
years.  Built a new engine to install, never did.  Just recently sold it for
a grand.)
8. '80 Vanagon - Wanagon (I dunno, it just fits :)  Lost the Clutch
Hydraulics friday, gotta fix it on monday, glad I've got the parts in stock.
Gonna replace both master &amp; slave cylinders, flush the system, etc.

I've had a lot of others, but no names for 'em.
