Subject: Best wishes, Gerry


This is a thank you to Gerry for putting this list into action and thereby
creating the only mailing list that I have stayed with for more than...
(ponder...  ponder) More than 2 years...  wow!
With the help of many dedicated type 2 owners this list has become a
wonderful thing, thank you Gerry and all other people who have contributed.
I'd be more than willing to up a donation to whomever will take on the admin
responsibilities.

Hoping that you're not leaving us, Gerry, but simply passing the work on.
