anachronistic old Harris said:
&gt;Does it matter how fast you drive on the way to the bank to get the
&gt;withdrawal (oh, and a withdrawal of extraordinary magnitude, I'm sure)
&gt;needed to keep the 1990 running?

the answer is: Yes.

you see, it involves Supply-Side Economics, Ripple-Factor Monetary
Distribution, and Fraudulent Check Bouncing.  By driving faster to
more than one bank, you can actually withdraw enough money to keep
a Water-Cooled VW Bus running.  And running it must remain, in order
to stay one step ahead of the High Sheriff and his Process Servers!

Actually, it is the function of all Vanagon owners to keep Volkswagen
in business in this country ... so all you older bus owners can have
some place to drive by and point at when the wife/kids/dog are in the
bus. :)

air-cooled buses are just a bunch of Hot Air!!     :)

&lt;putting on my asbestos suit RIGHT now!! &gt;

backatcha, boys!
&lt;ain't life grand ... when you can be bored to death and have a tiny little
email message perk you up?&gt; :)
