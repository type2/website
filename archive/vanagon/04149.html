The problem with the BBQ gague is that if you read the instructions it says
it is not accurate until after, like, 5 mins of continuous significant drain
on the system. So, you have to run out and look at it only after cooking a
big meal. Running the fridge isn't sufficient. Then, the markings are not
very clear so I have had this gague for two years and I still can't make a
use out of it. The gague I speak of is the one with a big dial face and three
calibrations depending on whether it is hot, medium or cold outside. The
model is like GasGlow or something like that. I do not recomend you guys try
this.
