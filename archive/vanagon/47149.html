&gt;Does anyone need an extra wheel cover?  I have I think one of the &quot;faux&quot; 
&gt;spoke covers for shipping cost.

Paul, not to be piggish, but can you tell me what it looks like?  I have an
83 Vanagaon w/ three faux covers that all have a silver spoke design with
black lug nuts and black VW symbol. If it looks like this, send it on!  I'll
cover costs and fix you lunch...
