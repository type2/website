Subject: Fog Light

I have uncovered why my fog light diode wouln't light up. 
Thanks for all the help in trying to fix it.
I had to bring in a eltrician friend of mine to do it. 
The two wire wires which I had assumed to be hot and ground are both
ground, thus grounding the relay and closing the connection. So at this
point I can either bring power to the bulb directly or permently ground
the relay and have the switch close the connection for power to the
relay.

Thanks again for all the help

John
