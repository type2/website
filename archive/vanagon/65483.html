When our Syncro Westfalia gets really grungy, we drive it into the
Ottawa River, all the way in, to up over the roof (having remembered to
leave the windows open, of course). When we think its clean enough
(about 1 and a half hours ususally does it), we drive it back out into
the sun and wait for it to dry off. :-)
