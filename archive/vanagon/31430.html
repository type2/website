That would be a diode, not a resistor.  All a resistor does is soak up
some energy and convert it to heat.  A diode allows current to flow in
one direction, but not the other.  I would expect that the diode would
go between the regulator and the second battery, rather than having a
connection between the two batteries, since you want the secondary to
charge, and provide power to things not connected to the primary.
