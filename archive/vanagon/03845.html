&gt; Only six postings came in: 1 of those was for a 73, 1 was from Joel who no
&gt; longer has an air-cooled vanagon but was kind enough to send in his
&gt; summary anyway; 

This has to be a joke.  Joel was &quot;kind enough&quot; to send you data? Ha-Ha
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!

Just try and STOP him from sending data  ;) ;) ;)
