Subject: F. Red Rock - Last

O.K everyone left out Jacks's homebrew - this was good stuff!

Also, next time EVERYONE has to bring firewood.  You can never
have enough.  Continuous 8 foot flames are wimpy ;)

Classic one-liner goes to Al: &quot;Burn the f**ker!&quot;

For next trip how about somewhere near the CA/AZ/NV boarder?
Say Lake Mojave?  Havasu?  Powell????
