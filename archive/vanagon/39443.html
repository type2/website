Subject: Oil temp

Is there such a thing as an engine running TOO cool?

In light of what (sorry I can't remember who quoted this) Gene Berg says
about fixing the problem, not the symptom, it struck me that it might be
possible to overcorrect.  If an engine is well-tuned and running fine,
would it make sense to add an oil-cooler as a precaution?  Or could you
bring the temp so low as to put the motor in a constant state of &quot;warming
up&quot; and never reach proper range.

...now let's see, once I get my fridge working again I can mount the oil
cooler inside it, run hose through the sink drain hole, back to the oil
pan...

I suppose it could get silly.

p.s. I'm only a little envious of the '74 and later campers with a solid
top bunk.  A 230 pound &quot;friend&quot; of mine thought he could sleep in
the cot on my '73.  He couldn't.  Good thing there were 3 people playing
cards at the table to break his fall.
