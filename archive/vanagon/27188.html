&gt; overhaul the spring plates.  And of course, the bus must be supported well

&gt; care of those junkyard spindles.

I don't know why you would need to rasie the front end to keep things 
level.  But I did anyway when I put in the new tranny.  Because... when 
you pull the tranny, you need to remove the wheels, and when you remove 
the wheels, you need to open the brake system.  So I wound up replacing 
most of the brake system.  Oh, and the races and bearings.  Reminds me... 
I gotta recheck the bearing play.
