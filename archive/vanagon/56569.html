Subject: '80-'84 Westy small dash outlet plug

I have found a male plug that fits into the tiny European style outlet that
is on the '80-'84 Westy's. 
You can wire whatever accessory you want into this plug. 

It is the same plug as the BMW heated motorcycle jackets use.

Call your local BMW motorcycle dealer and say you want part#
61138060106

they are around $9 apiece.
