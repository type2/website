john....

what you do is this....

the switch should have another contact on it...ground it. then turn the 
switch on, and watch them light up. this other contact is for the gorund 
for the light..:)

(hooked up lots and lots of lighted switches, ll over the place, in all 
sorts of things..:)


later...david
