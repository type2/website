I read in a recent ca.driving thread that you can pace a police car from
behind for as fast and as long as s/he is in FRONT of you;  apparently
they can only ticket you from behind.

Judging by our recent thread on the Type II speed demons, some of us
might want to teach the kids/pets how to spot those cars/planes.
