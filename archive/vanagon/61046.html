Subject: nylon window slides

VW no longer stocks replacement nylon window slides.  All they stock is a
complete window glass with the aluminum bar attached with nylon slides as
part of the aluminum bar.  This requires replacement of the entire window.

Does anyone know of a source for the nylon slides which just slide in where
the old ones fell out (88 vanigon camper)?
