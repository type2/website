Hi Everyone,

Today I walked outside to get into my van and noticed a small leak from the
engine.  After closer inspection I have a leaking head.  It is a '91 Westy
with 37,000 miles.  I would think the heads should last longer than that. 
My '86 Westy had 230,000 miles on it before I replaced the head gaskets. 
Should I call VWoA.  If so who do you talk to?  Any ideas would be greatly
appreciated.

&gt; Hello Volks,
&gt; 	Snowing here in northern Michigan today. Started this morning, was
raining
&gt; last nite. The well head is now covered up, this morning about 4&quot; were
&gt; showing and it's still coming down.
&gt; 	Had to go driving this morning, around town stuff, drop off the wife at
&gt; work, pick up a daughter at a friends and do that last minute shopping.
For
&gt; around town stuff I usually use the $100 honda (that's what it's for).
Went
&gt; out in the honda this morning, it did not take long to realize I should
&gt; have taken the bus! Went home and changed cars, the '86 syncro is made
for
&gt; snow. Did the rest of the running around, The syncro works great! It had
&gt; been awhile since I had to drive in the snow, ice and slush, comfortable
&gt; and smooth. I have had it slide on ice in past years but in this type of
&gt; weather the bus can't be beat. 
&gt; 	Going from the honda to the VW the differences were noticeable. 
&gt; 	I just had to tell someone.
&gt; 	Thanks for listening. 
&gt; 	Merry Christmas to all and to all a good VW kind of day.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Rob
