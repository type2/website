&gt;     Despite my relentless efforts at restoring
&gt;     the heat xfr coefficient thru mechanical
&gt;     and chemical means, its time to replace
&gt;     &quot;ye 'ole coolant cooler&quot;. Not sure of 
&gt;     interchangeability, but if its close we
&gt;     can make it fit!  E-mail direct if you're
&gt;     a source or know of one in NE.
&gt;     Dealer/parts said $400 new....

Warren,
I have new German ones for $249.95.
