Hell, In the non catalytic, carburated engines, all you have to do is 
shut off the ignition while still moving and in gear...
This will fill up your exhaust with plenty of air/fuel...

When it ignites it'l shoot a nice flame cone outta the pipe...

However on some of our busses It might just blow the rusty old pipes
right off of the manifolds.
