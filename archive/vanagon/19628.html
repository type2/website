Subject: AC Question

Has anyone had any experience with top mounted AC units on a Westy?  ie 
the type used on motorhomes and conversion vans?  I spotted a 70's type 
bus/westy a few days ago that looked like it had such an animal mounted 
on top of the skylight vent.  Would/could this type of unit function well 
on a westy?  What about the added weight on the fiberglass as well as the 
angle when the top is up?  Ideas/Suggestions appreciated, its hot down 
here in the summer, and an ac unit for camping would be great!
