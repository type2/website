Subject: 2001 great on poptop

FWIW, I think I've discovered the solution to protecting Tugboat's fiberglass
top.  I've struggled with all sorts of waxes, but the 2001 silicone based
liquid produced a paint-job like slick finish, bringing out the deep maroon
color and removing the whitish wax residue.  All the black moldings, mirrors,
bumpers, dashboard, etc. look great, but it remains to be seen what rain and
dirt will do.  Anyone else tried it?
