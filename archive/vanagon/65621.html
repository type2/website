Steve,

Your correct.  That's why I had to pull the high beam switch two times.

&gt;
&gt; For those of you who try this trick, I believe it only works on when the
&gt; brights are applied.   If when you turn off your headlights they are in
&gt; the low beam position and your turn on the lights with the ignition off
&gt; and pull the &quot;flasher&quot; switch and hold, the window switch will work.
&gt; However, if the headlights were in the bright position or if you have
&gt; &quot;flashed&quot; your lights once, then the flasher will be in the low beam
&gt; position and the window trick will not work until the flasher is in the
&gt; high beam position.
&gt;
&gt;  Does this description make any sense to anyone but me????
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, as I found out, it won't work at all with hand crank
&gt; windows!!!
