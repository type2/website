&gt; And through it.  :)  I use the stuff all the time, it's a great

Me too!  I had no wipers on my Capri for almost 3 years and never had a
problem driving in the rain.  Above 30 mph the water just blows off of the
window.  Below 30 you can still see pretty well - better than old blades
smearing up your windshield anyway...
