Subject: Free Vanagon seat in Seattle, WA


I just got a couple of new seats for my 82 vanagon Westy,
the drivers seat was totally thrashed, but the passenger
seat isnt as bad and seems to still have some life in it.

If your springs are coming through the seat into the small
of your back, and youre nearby, the seats are yours.

u-haul.  If anyone wants the thrashed seat, let me know
right away or its going to the dumpster  (I promised myself
I wouldnt cry...)
