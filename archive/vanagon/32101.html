Subject: Re: valve adjustment + what else

&gt;ok, after much talk i bought gaskets and am going to do my first valve
&gt;adjustment this weekend (please don't ask how many miles its been
&gt;since the last). i've read about it, looks totaly doable and then
&gt;some, two questions before sunday rolls around...
&gt;
&gt;1) as far as glue for the gaskets, i've heard use silicone based glue
&gt;or whell bearing grease.  anyone have an opinion.
&gt;
&gt;2) besides looking around a lot, anything else i can do while i've got
&gt;the covers off?  check the torque on the heads??  (as if i have a clue
&gt;as to what that means at this moment).
&gt;
&gt;take care all,
&gt;           brandy


You might want to get a headlamp...you can pick them up at wallmart or
whatever for around $5. This comes in handy when you need to see and you
need both hands...

Also, as it's your first valve job, make sure to check each gap when you
adjust it with the .07 blade to make sure it's not too big... I just did my
valve job as well and it came out pretty okay...not too painful at all..
