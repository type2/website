&gt;Does anyone know of any visible distinctions between the 1981 &amp; 1982
&gt;Vanagons?

I'm gonna venture to say that the '82's  were:

- the first year that the slider door didn't have that little plastic tab
thingie by the handle to keep you from catching your clothes on the handle...

-the &quot;L&quot; was superceded by the &quot;GL&quot; as the top model.
