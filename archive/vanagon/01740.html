&gt;After reading all of the last postings on hubcaps I've come to the
&gt;conclusion that these VW vans, busses, campers or whatever you want to
&gt;call them are all prone to lossing one hupcap !  What's the deal ?
&gt;Must be some kind of hubcap conspiercy concocted by &quot;Hubcap Annie&quot; so's
&gt;they can sells us some hubcaps  -  yea that's it !

it's the little Hubcap Gnomes from the Schwartzwald. they use them for hats.
to keep the bird droppings out of their ears. the reason they only take one
hubcap is that they are very style-conscious and don't want to wear exactly
what the others are wearing. appearances, don't you know. :)
