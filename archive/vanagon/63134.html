Subject:      Re: using vanagon bench seat in a Westy

&gt;I'd like to add more seating to my 85 Westy using the vanagon
&gt;bench seat recently put up for sale.  I've got a single seat that
&gt;slides in on the floor rails which are full width.  Since I'm not
&gt;located near enough to the vanagon bench seat to try it myself does
&gt;anyone know if it will fit with the Westy stove, etc?

The 2 seater middle bench (from a 7 passenger model) fits perfectly.  We
install and remove our 2 seat bench whenever we need the extra seats and
belts.  It is easy and doesn't take long at all.  The rails under the rail
covers are bolted down so you don't need to bolt anything.  I guess you
could bolt it to prevent side to side movement but this will only occur
when the sliding door is open.  When closed the seat is snug between the
fridge and the door.

This past weekend we used the extra seat since we were 5 in number for our
weekend camping adventure.  At destination we removed the middle bench and
put it just outside the door under the awning.  It was very handy having
this bench along.  On our way home we had to access the fridge several
times.  No problem, we just opened the sliding door and slid the seat 1/4
of the way out.

Works great for us.  I highly recommend this for anyone who needs the seats.
