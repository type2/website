Subject: Dave K. on Re: greasing rear wheel bearings

&gt; Martin,
&gt;
&gt; If I was going to all the trouble to dis-assemble the rear hubs, I would
&gt; REPLACE the bearings. It's a big job. I need to double check this, but
&gt; I think that the lubrication interval was dropped on later breadloaves.
&gt; That is to say, there is no recommended re-lubrication mileage. Mine
&gt; have 190,000 miles on them and have never been opened. The design was
&gt; unchanged after 1971 &lt;there was a smaller outside bearing in there until
&gt; 1970, shared with the splitties&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; If your bus is making noises or vibration due to those bearings, new parts
&gt; are appropriate.

  I've been going by my Volkswagen Official Service Manual 1968-1976 models
  In section 9 pg8 under &quot;every 30,000mi.&quot; 
  1) Front wheel bearings (1968 through 1972 vehicles) clean and repack.
  2) Rear wheel bearings (1968 through 1972 vehicles) clean and repack.

  I've got 230,000 miles and I've always had someone repack them every 30k
  I don't hear any noise...I don't want to wait till I do...but you think
  repacking them is unnecessary? Now you have me wondering...I'll have to
  investigate this further...I sure don't WANT to do them if I don't have to.

   Martin
