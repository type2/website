Subject: List Management Handoff

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, I'm sure everyone reaslizes by now that the list is crashed and no one
can subscribe and all the archives are hosed.  Of course, the reason is
that I'm no longer in charge here.  Uncle Joel has wrested power from my
feeble (comparatively) grasp and is now shaping the list in accordance
with his own whims!    &lt;this is a joke ...

Now, I'm telling the truth here.  (This is true...It actually is happening)
I'm leaving for a 3 week vacation.  In my absence, Joel Walker
(jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu) will be managing the list for me. As a matter of fact,
he is doing so yesterday through friday. I guess he's doing a pretty good
just because no one seems to be complaining to me that Uncle Joel is picking
on them.  Please address any list problems to Joel, and he'll help you out.
He's a highly trained expert in this field having braved the hardships of
IBM 3270 life for a long time.  I don't know what else to say.  I guess
things will run normally.  I'll try to dial in a couple of times while I'm
gone, but no promises. Let me know if there are any really big problems.

Good Luck!
Gerry
