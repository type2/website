&gt; Let me weigh in here and also concur with our &quot;ferret-miester's&quot; opinion.

Me too.  Only I own a GL.  I looked for a weekender MV when I bought the
GL, and called VW's 800 number to locate a 5-speed new on the lot (this was
fall of 94).  Only weekenders they showed on their computer were two
automatics in Hawaii at the time!  So I bought the GL.  Looked at the
Winnie Bagoo, but figured for the 14K I saved on the GL, I could afford a
hitch and a trailer.  Haven't added either yet,  but it will be nice not to
have to camp in the VW for trips like  backcountry 4-wheeling, for which
the spousal unit's  Montero comes in handy.
