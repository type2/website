&gt;&gt; I have to differ with you on the Type IV engine.  On my '74 the fan was smack
&gt;&gt; dab in the middle attached to the crank shaft.  But then again, I'm not sure
&gt;&gt; of the air routing/porting in the fan housing.  That would be the only other
&gt;&gt; obstruction flowing difference between cyl. #1 and #3.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Am I wrong about this?
&gt;
&gt;Not exactly.  The fan is centered, yes, but the cylinders are staggered.
&gt;Think about the crankshaft - the number 3 cylinder connects furthest
&gt;towards the front of the motor, and is therefore a few inches farther 
&gt;away from the fan than number one.  Also, the oil cooler &quot;uses&quot; some of
&gt;the cooling air for the number 3 and 4 cylinders, so I would guess they
&gt;run hotter than the right bank.  I wonder if they designed the fan
&gt;housing to route a little more air to the left bank to compensate for
&gt;that... hmmm... I'll have to check into that, but I bet Dave Kautz
&gt;already knows.  :)

Thats why they came up with the &quot;doghouse&quot; shroud in '71, to compensate for 
this.  They also started using a fan that was 5mm wider.  I just put one
of these setups on my beastie.  Have to wait 'til its hot to see if it works,
though!
