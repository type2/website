    Ray:  VW also takes home a trophy in the discomfort category.  In
    particular, the nod goes to the old, air-cooled Volkswagen Micro-
    bus.  Not only have I ridden camels that made my butt less sore, 
    but you could never get enough heat in the winter.  And because 
    the passenger compartment was so big, your body heat would never
    make a difference.  In the Microbus, you'd need a family of 
    panting St. Bernards to keep the temperature above freezing.

well, i live about 400 yards from the Good News
Garage and had been wondering if i might want
to try using them.  not that i am unhappy with
Auto-Bon imports (Whitey is terrific), but just
wondering.  you settled it.  thanks.
