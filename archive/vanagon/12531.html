&gt; My question is: What are the engine RPM compared to MPH, ie, 75 mph = ? RPM 
&gt; etc. ( I have a clock not a tach). I want to figure fuel, etc. during my 
&gt; trip as well as get the best RPM for cruising speed without undue engine 
&gt; wear. (the engine has about 94,200 miles on it.)
&gt; 
 
Hi Matt.  I usuallly cruise no faster than a relaxing 100 km/hr (62 
mph), and enjoy the scenery.  At that speed, engine rpm is around 
3400 rpm.  Up hills, I push her no harder than 3800-4000 rpm in third 
or sometimes in second gear!... this equates to around 75-80 km/hr in 
third gear, and around 60 km/hr in second (if I remember correctly).  
I average between 23 and 24 mpg (imperial measurments) no matter what 
terrain I travel over.  Fuel mileage is amazingly quite steady.

Cruising at 75 mph would put your engine rpm at or close to 4000 rpm. 
This is quite a bit of strain, IMHO, and wouldn't recommend 
continuous cruising at that speed.

Hope this helps.

Harry.
