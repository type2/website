Subject: Meet me in Puyallup at the fair....

{For those of you who remember the song, `Meet me in Seattle at the fair/
If you wanna meet me, meet me there....'} 
Who's gonna be there, and what'll you be driving? I'll be driving my 
semi-roadworthy (cross your fingers!) `66 westywidget (bubble top. The
Oddest Camper-Looking Thing In Washington. It looks like a giant ice-cream
cone from the rear.) Hope it makes it! I'll be the short, fat swarthy
Italian guy in the obnoxious purple shirt! C'mon, there's 17(?) of us 
here in WA, Let's all get together, drink too much beer, and piss
off our SO's so we get to sleep in our busses! :)
