Subject: RE: Catalytic Heater

&gt;There is a question as to how to rig the venting, but I am thinking of
&gt;venting through the battery compartment, as this has a vent leading under
the
&gt;front passenger seat to the outside of the vehicle. Venting is by means of
a
&gt;flexible 1.5&quot; hose that may be cut to any length or even vented down
through
&gt;the floor.

Am definitely interested. Want to hear some further details as to the
venting issues (was about to have an Olympian installed).

Also, I have some general questions about cold weather camping. We are very
interested in being able to take our Westy on ski excursions where temps as
low as 0-f may be encountered. Do we need to gut our rig and insulate to
stay comfortable - even with a catalytic heater? If so, what is the best
insulation? There's this stuff that I've seen at the hardware stores that
is essentially aluminum foil coated bubble wrap. It seems like this would
be easy to install just about everywhere (other than for the dismantling
tasks). Anybody think this is the wrong way to go?

And Derek, what was involved in getting a second propane tank installed?

Paul
