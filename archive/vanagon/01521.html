Subject: New Body Panels

Does anyone have any experience doing body work on their VW's?

I am contemplating replacing the rear apron and driver side rocker panel on
my 73 westphalia.  The rest of the body is in good shape and I'd rather
replace panels than try to repair rotted panels.

I know that I can order the necessary replacement body panels so I'm
looking for advice on how well these panels are likely to fit and how to
attach them to the vehicle - arc/gas/mig welding, brazing, pop rivets (my
favorite), duct tape.....
