Randy,

I would just be careful about running the compressor(accidentally) without it
being charged.  Most rely on the refrigerant for lubrication.  I learned this
the hard way on my scirroco.  Some cars run the compressor when the defroster
is switched on but I don't think the vanagons do.

&gt;I was thinking the same thing, I prefer not to use the air unless it's
blistering out there. I was thinking about getting it filled and checked,
but was scared to know how many of the kids I'd have to sell (just kidding
of course! ;) ). From the sounds of it, if there is anything major wrong,
I'd be better off painting the top white ( currently beige metallic ),
getting some limo tint for the rear and side windows, and maybe even remove
the air to put in a moon-roof. Any thoughts on the subject ?&lt;
