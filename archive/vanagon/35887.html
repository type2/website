&gt; hi gregg, 
&gt; 	I have an '81 Westy, ie. air cooled, not much to bleed. It's funny 
&gt; the box my thermostat came in also told me to bleed my cooling system 
&gt; and fill the radiator with the engine running. These thermostat must 
&gt; be used on water cooled engines too. 
&gt; 	Thanks for the information, I'll look at my Bentley.

Hey Johnny,

May maybe he meant your own bodys cooling system.  Have you been
properly bled yet?  ;)
