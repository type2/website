Subject: Re: macklow's accel problem



&gt;
&gt;i did find one slightly related bulletin, and it made me think about my
&gt;rotor and distributor cap: i have to replace them about every 25,000 miles
&gt;or so, cause they get rather burned on the contacts inside. any chance
&gt;your dist. cap and rotor might be needing replacement?
&gt;


	When I got my new engine in the van, it had one of
	those black suppression covers on the dist. cap.
	The engine developed a miss, cyl #3, an it turned
	out to be due to some dirt lodged on that cover
	causing a short. Removing the cover revealed a
	burn mark on the cap by #3 post. Keeping the cover
	off resolved the problem (got a new cap soon).
	The miss was intermittant at first, but grew steadly
	worse, finally being constant.
