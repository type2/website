&gt;1989 TRISTAR, rare, 1 owner, 35,000 mi, collectible, EPA sticker for USA,
&gt;only 19 built in N. America, fact. mags, pw, pdl, ps, GL'd, exc. cond.
&gt;$39,500  Call (604) 756-0571 Nanaimo, B.C.

don't forget: you'll have to pay duty on it to cross the border, and last
time i heard, it was 25 percent!! it shouldn't be more than about $25,000US.

&gt;Photo: Real big double cab P/U, with &quot;4WD&quot; in big letters ahead of the
&gt;front door.  My guess is this is a synchro double cab version of the
&gt;Volkswagen LT, the mutant vehicle that looks like a vanagon but is about
&gt;1/3 larger in every dimension.  From what I can see in the photo, it
&gt;looks very clean (sano!), very mean.

nope. it's a vanagon, all right. the tri-star is a special edition double-
cab pickup truck with FOUR doors!!! &lt;a normal double-cab has only three
doors). plus they added all that other luxury junk at the factory. it's a
neat car, and they didn't import very many of them, so in a sense, it's
rather rare. i'd LOVE to have one ... especially since it's a Syncro. :)

but i be broke. :(
