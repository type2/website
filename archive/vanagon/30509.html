&gt;J. One of my older buses had the same problem of the rusted up heat
&gt;exchangers and cables. Aquick fix until the spring is to get underneath
&gt;with some &quot;chickwire&quot; and wire the heat exchangers in the open position.
&gt;Also check for rust holes in the heat exchangers themselves  and patch
&gt;them up with some duck tape. I did this one winter and managed to produce
&gt;some decent heat.
&gt;
&gt;                        Good Luck

I did this to my '71 recently with good results...but I did notice a smell
of exhaust. Remember that exhaust fumes make you smell bad, get angry
easily, loose brain cells, and in extreme cases, die.

Especially bad for young children...so my bus is parked again 'til I get
back to it (or pull the wires off and live without heat). Got time off for
Christmas that will be spent looking for leaks.

Good luck! Joe
