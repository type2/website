Subject: Re: Getting Bob Home

Y'all remember that Tim Robbins movie &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; in which groupies ended
up chanting &quot;BOB!, BOB!, BOB!, BOB!, BOB!, BOB!&quot;, holding candles and with
that faraway look in their eyes. (sounds like a rolling stones song)

If I've offended anyone on the list then I could promise to go to
confession, &quot;Forgive me 'Bob' for I have sinned...&quot;

&quot;Mebbee&quot; it's best we let ol' Bob flounder until the Friday Funnies...

&gt;       (to be chanted by the hordes of VW enthusiasts) &quot;Oh Bob Hoover, our
&gt;humble guru, we beseech thee; for our Type II's have gone astray; give us
&gt;this day the knowedge to heal them and make them well, and with them become
