Whenever I hear stories like this, it reminds me of a 66 Bug I had once. Ran
like a top, at least at idle, for as long as you wanted. But if I drove it at
all, it would die after about 2-3 minutes as if it were out of gas. But after
some cranking, it would start up again easily.

Finally traced the problem to a partially clogged fuel line! It would flow
enough fuel to idle, and to fill the carb bowl when starting, but not enough to
run the engine at full power, as this would drain the carb bowl, and the
engine would die!

Check this out! It may save you a lot of unnecessary 'repairs'.
