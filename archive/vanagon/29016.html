Subject: Re: UniRoyal Laredo C rated 195x75 ?

Hello Al.  Don't buy these tires for your Syncro unless it can handle 
the weight.  The Syncro is *heavy*... MIchelin xch4's won't even hold 
it up.  You should look for a D load rating.  Make sure that the tire 
can withstand the Syncro's appetite for air pressure... 43 psi front, 
and 53 psi rear.  Most tires can't take this pressure.  A D load 
rating tire should be able to withstand over 1700 lbs each at max 
psi.

I've put my Syncro on the truck scales at over 5250 lbs ... loaded 
for a 2 week vacation with the 2 of us in it.

If you don't want to go with the stock Conti's or Michelin 
&quot;reinforced&quot; tires, go with an LT truck tire that has the above load 
/weight, and psi ratings.  This is important for not only safety, but 
good handling.

The Yokohama Y370 LT195-75R14 is just an excellent tire for this van. 
 I'm on my second set now, and they are excellent in wet weather, off 
road, ice, etc.  They aren't noisy, and they ride &amp; wear well.  These 
tires are D rated, 1755 lbs (approx) weight rating, and can go up to 
65 psi for heavier applications.  I don't get a kick back from Yoko, 
although I should, eh??!!  

Any other thoughts, let me know,
Harry.

&gt; My local costco has this tire 2ply sidewall, 4ply tread, C rated, max pressure
&gt; 50PSI at ~60$ each.  
&gt; 
&gt; The questions for net.vw.wisdom are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  ennybody running these shoes?  How do you like em and on what bus are they?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  What would the rolling diameter difference be between 205/70 MXL$$$ and 
&gt;     195x75.  
&gt; 
&gt; The intended use is a mostly on road syncro westie.
&gt; 
&gt; Derek?, Harry?, Syncrohead? whats the poop?
&gt; 
&gt; It is my understanding that the 205/70 MXL reinforced is NLA, BTW.
