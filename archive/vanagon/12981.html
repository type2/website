Subject: Re: The shower thing :}

Bardley et al:  I went back to West Marine to look at the 12v blender,
because when I first saw it, I neglected to check the price.  This
time I did:  it was over $100.    :(((((((((((((((((((  I guess
the lucky ones who shower are just going to have to make their
margaritas manually...
