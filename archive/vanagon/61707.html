Subject: Re: Question: ...releasing clutch and *CLUNK-INK noise occurs

I had a grinding noise while the clutch was disengaged, it turn out that the
Throw out bearing (TOB) was gone.  I had it in for a clutch replacement when
they found that the TOB was completely worn out.  The TOB was replaced along
with the other clutch parts and the grinding noise is gone now
