&gt;Like all good EV owners I spent last friday nite under it changing the oil
&gt;and filter. I saw something that I had seen before on Vanagons:
&gt;
&gt;There is an oil cooler on EV's just like the ones on Vanagons. It is held
&gt;onto its mounting by a large, flat nut. When changing the filter on vanagons
&gt;it's easy to see/feel if this nut is tight. If its not it will loosen and in
&gt;time prevent the filter/cooler from seating. Then it will be a mysterious
&gt;oil leak. Until this nut is tightened no amount of torque on the filter will
&gt;seal it or the oil cooler seal.
&gt;
&gt;On the EV's next filter change check this nut! Its hard to see but is very
&gt;important.

Don, can you explain a bit more the oil cooler?   As you know, the EV filter
is not in the most accessible location and I have to change it by feel alone.
Is the flat nut only exposed once the oil filter has been removed?

The oil filter on my Quantum's I-5 mounts directly to the block and is the
easist filter change I've ever done.  The EV is definitely the hardest to
access.
