&gt;I have an 82 fuel injected gas Vanagon.  Started getting hard to

&gt;Knowledgeable friend says I need new air flow sensor.  YIKES! 
&gt;Big $$$!  Any other ideas?  Thanks.

If it's similar to a '78 I've worked on, you might check the cold start
injector, the temp sensor, and the wiring to these.  Though cheaper than
the AFM, NONE of the FI stuff is exactly what I'd call cheap, IMHO. :)
