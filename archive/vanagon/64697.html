Subject:      Does anyone here go to MU?

I was curious to know if anyone on the list is at the University of =
Missouri at Columbia right now?  There are a lot of Vanagons here, but I =
haven't seen any list stickers. If there is someone here I am the one =
with the Yakima Racks sticker in the windshield and one rack, not the =
other Silver 87 Vanagon GL Wolfsburg with three racks on the roof. :)
