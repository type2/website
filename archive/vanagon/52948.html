Subject: Leak Down Test, define ?


What is meant by a &quot;leak down test&quot; ?

I'm having a problem with power (loss) in my 82' Vanagon. The tech
suggested a do a leak down test to determine why I have &quot;massive&quot; power
loss on the #3 &amp; #4 cylinders. I had the car in the shop for an unrelated
sensor adjustment 

I am going to do a compression check (dry &amp; wet) ASAP, is this what is
meant by a &quot;leak down test&quot; ?

Thanks, Chris
