Subject: Found some VW's
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 1995 14:19:10 -0800 (PST)


This morning felloe list-member Cecil and I ventured to a secret spot
where he knew some VW's were stored.

On the way, we saw lots and lots of bugs, sometimes in pods of 5 or more,
grazing in the fields.  But we moved on.

What we did find was a '55 camper bus, with semaphores.  It was in
good Oster Kondition.  It had quite a bit of surface rust where the owner
had sanded all the paint off with the intent of doin' some body work, and...
It had the wrong front bumper on it, but the proper one was in the back.
It also had the correct engine lid, but the wrong engine.  Not too much
serious cancer in general - the rockers were bumpy but solid.  Same with
the nose.  The bus is a camper with the big Hitler Hatch - who made these
conversions, anyway?  It also has some funky aftermarket lights in it 
(we all know that story, right?)

The second tempting treat was a '62 ghia coupe.  Very straight, solid body,
including the nose, complete with radiator cap and nostril filters.  The
inside was in very good condition, save for an arachnid plantation. (yes suh!)

He wants $3k for the pair, but we're gonna try to talk him down.  I want
the bus, Cecil wants the ghia.  He won't sell one without the other.
