Subject:      setting vw radio codes

somebody asked for the instructions on the vw radios that came in some
of the vanagons, and i figured someone else might want to see this. i don't
know if it applies to ALL of the vw radios ... this is a Heidelberg 5,
it has &quot;VW Design&quot; on the cassette door, and a big on/off/volume switch.

ok, out to the bus, rummage around in the glove box: no book. :(
keep rummaging ... finally, under the driver's seat, the Radio Booklet!

Theft Prevention System.
The radio is equipped with an electronic locking system that is activated
by entering a code number, to make the radio useless if tampered with.
If the radio is disconnected from its power supply, it cannot be operated
until the correct code number is entered.

At the Factory, the radio is programmed with the code number 1111.

To protect your radio against theft, it is necessary that you replace the
factory code number with your personal code number. Once selected, it is
important that you record your personal code number in the Radio-Card at the
end of this manual and keep it in a safe place away from the vehicle.

Preparing the Radio for Operation.
Every time the radio is disconnected from the vehicle power supply, the
battery is disconnected, or even if the radio fuse blows, the radio must
be re-coded to make it operational.

* Turn radio on (1) - &quot;SAFe&quot; is displayed on the frequency display.
* Press AM/FM BAND SELECTOR (13) and then SCAN BUTTON (20) and hold them
      down together until &quot;1000&quot; appears in the frequency display.
* After the &quot;1000&quot; display goes out, enter the factory code or secret
      personal code using the first four station buttons (5). Use button 1
      to set the first digit of the four digit code, button 2 to set the
      second, etc. Press each button the number of times needed to enter
      that digit.
* Finally, press AM/FM BAND SELECTOR (13) and then SCAN BUTTON (20) and hold
      then down together until a frequency appears in the display. The radio
      is ready for operation.

Cancelling Radio Code.
* Switch on radio that was prepared for operation (1).
* Press AM/FM BAND SELECTOR (13) and then SCAN BUTTON (20) and hold them down
     together until &quot;SAFe&quot; appears in the frequency display. After that,
     &quot;1000&quot; will be displayed.
* After the &quot;1000&quot; display goes out, use the station buttons (5) to enter the
     factory code or your personal code, if that has already been entered.
     Use buttons 1 through 4 to enter the first through fourth digits by
     pressing each button the number of times necessary to encode the
     respective digit.
* Finally, press the AM/FM BAND SELECTOR (13) and then SCAN BUTTON (20) and
     hold them down together until the word &quot;Code&quot; is displayed.

The radio code has been cancelled.

Entering Personal Code Number.
* Cancel radio code as described.
* Press AM/FM BAND SELECTOR (13) and then SCAN BUTTON (20) and hold them down
     together until &quot;Code&quot; appears in the radio frequency display. After that,
     &quot;1000&quot; will appear.
* After the &quot;1000&quot; code goes out, enter your personal code number using the
     station buttons (5). By pressing the first station button , enter a
     1 or no number can selected. Using the next three buttons, any desired
     between 0 and 9 can be entered by pressing the button that number of
     times. In this way, your three or four digit secret number can be
     programmed.
* Finally, press the AM/FM BAND SELECTOR (13) and then the SCAN BUTTON (20)
     and hold them down together until the word &quot;SAFe&quot; appears in the
     frequency display. The radio is now coded with your personal number.

You should write down your personal code number in the Radio-Card at the end
of this manual to be sure that a false code is not accidentally entered when
preparing the radio for operation. Keep it in a safe place away from the
vehicle!

False Code Numbers.
If a false code is entered while &quot;Preparing radio for operation&quot;, the word
&quot;SAFe&quot; will blink for several seconds after pressing the AM/FM BAND SELECTOR
(13) and the SCAN BUTTON (20).
Then, the entire procedure will have to be repeated. After the third attempt
with a false code number, &quot;SAFe&quot; remains in the frequency display and the
radio can no longer be operated. In this case, you will need to go to a VW
dealer for help.
-----------------------------------------------
on the Short Operating Instruction page, where the diagram of the (??) numbers
is matched to a picture of the radio, this note is found:
(1) ON/OFF Switch ....NOTE: The radio is equipped with a theft prevention code.
    Should there be no sound after the radio is switched on and &quot;SAFe&quot; is
    displayed, a special code must be entered. See Page 7.

(13) AM/FM BAND SELECTOR is the leftmost top button, in the little row of
     buttons under the cassette hole, to the left of the &lt;&lt; button.
(20) RADIO SCAN BUTTON is teh rightmost top button, in the little row of
     buttons under the cassette hole, to the right of the &gt;&gt; button.

sorry to be late. totally forgot about it. :)
