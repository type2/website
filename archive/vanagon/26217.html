Part 1

How do I put this? I have a 77 Camper (great green). On a snowy day about 
two week ago here in Boulder I was getting gas at a Texaco station. I was 
approached by a female college student who had recently bought a 74 Camper 
(classic orange, with a slight bulge in the poptop toward the back of the 
passenger side. As it was cold and she and her friend were on their way 
back to school in Santa Barbara and had some mountain passes to go over, 
she asked if the heating system of my bus worked well. I said: &quot;Heat? 
This is a bus. What do you mean, 'heat'?&quot; We talked about it for a while 
and I suggested as they were leaving for the coast right then that they 
purchase a small camping heater for the road. I also mentioned this list 
and was going to e-mail them the address. I got the address but it was 
incomplete and has bounced back. If anyone sees this bus in the Santa 
Barbara area you might stick a note with the vanagon list address under the 
wiper blade. I'm sure they'll be suprised :)

Part 2

Anyone know of a good, inexpensive heating alternative for the 70s 
campers? Apparently there's some sort of compact heater that plugs into 
the cigarette lighter. I suppose one needs to install the lighter first. 
But has anyone had experience with this type of heater?

Part 3

Windshield wiper blades. I presently have some generic blades that I 
bought at K-Mart. They don't seen to quite do the job in areas. Is it worth 
tracking down the Bosch version?
