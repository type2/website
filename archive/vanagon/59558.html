&gt;&gt;Hi Gang,
&gt;&gt;I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3
&gt;&gt;years
&gt;&gt;now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like to
&gt;&gt;stop.
&gt;&gt;I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier was 
&gt;&gt;interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of network
&gt;&gt;resources and $$.
&gt;
&gt;I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt;purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt;cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a T1.
&gt;
&gt;If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt;host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
