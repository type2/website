&gt; was $85 a pop, finally found them at Big 10 in Doraville, GA for $69.

The standard price here in Durham, NC was $76 each but I was able to get
them for $70.  I used the $67 price for the XZX from Vantastics as my data
of persuasion.  I have no idea how they will wear long term, but they sure
do give a great ride now.
