Subject:       more TRUEly shocking stories

newly acquired (used) '67 Pontiac LeMans - 15 year old boy checking
out said car with his dad, bonding time ya know.  Slight miss at idle
so doing the 'power balance' thing by pulling off one spark plug wire
at a time to see which cylinder isn't pulling its share. Lean over
on fender with tender bits firmly pressed against sheet metal, gasp
wire and pull.  Resultant shock felt from entry point of finger tips
to exit point on tender bits.  Son shrieks, spas's out and father is
laughing so hard tears are coming down his cheeks.  Overall a very
memorable experience.
