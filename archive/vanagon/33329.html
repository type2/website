&gt; &gt;I'm sure I speak for all when I say I'd like to see some shots of your
&gt; &gt;V6nagon.  Maybe some engine shots as well along with how you have your
&gt; &gt;radiator hooked up.   I know you have mentioned your Vanagon in the past
&gt; &gt;but it just really didn't home til I read you post about the wiring
&gt; &gt;diagrams as to just how neat of a conversion this would be to see.  Slater!

&gt; I just started a Web Page, but it doesn't have a real URL address yet,
&gt; nor any photos. I'm a HTML neophyte, and haven't quite figured out
&gt; how to link to the photos.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, did you know that http://www.lookup_dot_com will give you a FREE web

&gt; Why do I get the feeling they will eventually start charging, once they

I'd be interested, periferally, as well.  When I had my 80 Westy with all
the mechanical problems, I cogitated about putting something else under the
hood.  Got the Kennedy catalogs, read them several times...main problem is
it was a wind-cooled van, so all the cooling lines and radiator would have
to have been added - a bit more than I was willing to do at the time.

There's a guy near where I live that has one of those VW shops that never
seems to be neat, with partially complete vehicles pouring out of every
square inch of space he's got, that has a V6anagon of sorts.  Told me it
had a Capri V6 in it that a former mechanic of his did the welding for the
mounts and exhaust system.  From the outside it looked okay, but on the
inside... what a mess!  Rather than construct a decent engine cover for the
thing, he simply put one of those big plastic bins upside down over the
engine!  He said it was very noisy and smelly.  I'm not surprised!  If I
remember correctly, the Kennedy catalog listed the Capri engine as one of
the tallest to have to fit, too.

I talked to the owner of German Auto in Norwalk, CA a few years back about
a customer of his that had put a 16V Jetta 138hp engine in a water-pumper
Westy without cutting anything.  I never saw the van, but I wonder if one
could simply use the engine supports and oil pan/suction pipe from a diesel
Vanagon to put one of these in neatly, maybe even convert a diesel to gas
this way.  Sounds like it might be a nice way to get more power without
losing interior space.  How high is the engine cover in the V6anagon?  A
taller cover might not be a problem in a bus, but in a Westy it could be a
disaster, unless the entire fold-down bed could be arranged to flatten at
the same height and there was still enough headroom otherwise.  I thought
about looking for a waterpumper westy with a bad engine to replace the 80,
but was too tired of the thing at the time to feel very enthusiastic.
Anybody do/see something like this done to a Westy?

P.S. As a followup to my &quot;enthusiasm&quot; comment above, and to avoid bringing
the wrath of all you good people down on me 8'), I have thought about
getting hold of another westy vanagon for camping, rather than building a
removable bed and cabinets for the EV, but can't presently afford one.
Maybe someday, perhaps a Syncro with a V6? or a 16V jetta?
