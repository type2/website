Subject: RE: water pump for 76 Westy

&gt;1) The water pump is getting juice but is dead. :-(
&gt;Anyone know where I can get a replacement?
&gt;Is it a hassle to install? (I'm a very MINOR mechanic).

If it's the same pump as was in my '78, you can find a replacement at any
RV shop. You'll need to remove the pump and take it with you for comparison
sake because the shop will know nothing about Westys, but more than likely
they'll have an identical model.

As for the difficulty factor, for me the biggest issue was that the pump
was located in this tiny cabinet space that made the simple task of
unhooking the hose clamps and wiring almost impossible. If you have a
clever 10 year old at hand, have them do the job while you supervise.
