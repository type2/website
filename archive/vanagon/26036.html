Subject:  Grendel, Bob, etc. 

Bob:

You mentioned that you don't want to use up your owed favours unless you 
have to.  I'm gonna go public with this, and hope I don't embarrass you.

Whatever I can supply that you need, however much, whenever, however 
often, you can have.  I can't supply large sums of cash, or working 
buses that are really in good condition, but...

Why?  You've helped me, and others, more than once.  I asked a vague 
question, and you gave me a detailed answer on the possibilities.  You 
don't hesitate to pass on the knowledge you need.  Your &quot;Zen and the Art 
of Grendel Maintenance&quot; serial is the first thing I read every morning, 
and one of the few things that I read every word of.

I don't know what I can supply from my position of ignorance some 3000 
miles away.  Moral support, sure.  Positive vibes, yeah.  Placating 
presents for you and your long-suffering hosts?  Name it -- if I can get 
it, you can have it.
