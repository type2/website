&quot;I can lock and unlock both doors from the inside or outside. 
I can operate the latches from inside or outside. 

HOWEVER, if I LOCK the door and *then* PULL on the outside release trigger, 
I can no longer unlock it from outside! Specificly, I can't get the lock 
cylinder to rotate in the unlock direction, and rotating in the lock 
direction has no effect.

 It can still be unlocked and unlatched from inside, luckily.&quot;

a spring in the door mechanism is broken.  That pulls back the piece out of
the way that you move with the door trigger.   When you  pull the lock
mechanism, examine its workings carefully.  ACtivate it as if you were
locking it form inside/outside/opening etc- to get a feel of the workings,
and see how the different moving pieces interact

hope it helps

look for the spring
