Subject:  dallas camping info wanted

i'm going to be in dallas, tx may 14-16 for a work-related class.  i'm
wondering if anyone on the list could recommend a nearby relatively
quiet and safe place i could use as home base to park and sleep. 
personal driveway offers gladly accepted, i'd be glad to whip up a tasty
vegetarian dinner or two in exchange.  

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
