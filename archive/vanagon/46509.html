&gt;Well, it's not up to any of us (save Gerry) but I have a feeling 
&gt;that the people who are cheering because they think their 
&gt;incoming mail is going to be reduced will be quite disappointed.  
&gt;I've only been on the list for 10 months or so but I figure that 
&gt;each list will get about 80-90% of the volume that this one does.  
&gt;Of course this means that people who don't want the split will 
&gt;get 160-180% of the current volume ;-(

Hmmm...  So what we really need is for each of the new remailers to
have two subscription lists--the AC remailer would have a list of
subscribers only to the AC list, and a list of subscribers to both
lists.  Similarly, the WC remailer would have a list of subscribers
only to the WC list, and a list of subscribers to both.  Then, when
messages come in that are cross-posted to both lists, they are only
sent to the joint subscribers once, via some protocal agreed on by the
two remailers.

That could work.  The total necessary bandwidth of the two remailers
would be the same or less than that required by the current list, and
hopefully the workload would be split somewhat evenly between the two
remailers via above-mentioned protocol.  People who want both sets of
messages would only get them once, and people who choose to listen to
only one side of the story would be able to choose to do that.

What about it, Ken and Gerry, can it be done?
