&gt; point in ruining it with the salt on the roads). Guess what? The fluid is
&gt; down exactly at the point just below the clutch fluid tube. Normally I would
&gt; say &quot;ok there is definitely a leak somewhere&quot;. BUT, I can't find a leak
&gt; anywhere and since the van hasn't moved in all this time, you would think
&gt; a puddle would be reasonably easy to see. What gives? Are my eyes failing
&gt; me? Has the fluid vapourized?  Has it been transported to a distant
&gt; planet? 
&gt; 
&gt; TIA - DC

My clutch master cylinder was leaking and the fluid was being absorbed
by the fiber floorboard.  It would drip from the master cylinder onto
the steering shaft boot and then run off onto the floorboard which is
very absorbent.  It took several inspections before I figured it out.
