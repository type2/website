I'm confident someone will object but, what-the-heck!!! -;)

I'm re-posting two messages (this is the second of two) that, after viewing 'thousands' 
over the last year, are my .picks for &quot;Most-Memorable&quot; and/or &quot;Most-Satisfying&quot;. Let 
me know your picks.

After an impromptu review by a probably-biased committee (of one, more than likely) 
the author of a selected cited message will be granted choice of beating with a wet 
noodle or three sips from a luke-warm Big-Gulp! :)
