Subject: '85 Won't start --update


I just had the same problem with my van again. It would turn over just
fine, but wouldn't catch.

I checked it out looking for anythign obvious...nothing. I checked to see
if there was any spark, and there was.

Now where should I go? I would do somethign if I knew a good place to
start...fuel pump maybe? Suggestions???

I'd appreciate any replies. I want to take advatage of break and go
camping and skiing if possible, not watching my van sit...

Thanks
