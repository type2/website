Subject: Re- Drivin' in Mean Wind 

Drafting a semi or bus does work under head/side wind conditions, as I found
out with my dad's Type 3 a few years back.  I'd never seen the needle go down
so slowly.

My dad didn't think it was such a hot idea; I think he was a little nervous
about the proximity of the trailer's back and my ability to react in time.

Anyway, here's something that I haven't seen in this thread yet...
Aside from stone chips peppering the face of your fine vehicle, has anyone
noticed any rise in engine temp from the reduction of air being rammed down
the vents.  I imagine this would have some detrimental effect down the line
somewhere, especially if you were air-cooled.

Norman &quot;oh damn, I'm off the back again!...&quot;
