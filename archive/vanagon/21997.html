Subject: Eurovan Westfalia Sighting

I saw  white Eurovan Westfalia this evening. I had seen this before,
went to a local dealer to inquire about it, and was told there were
no Westfalias imported since the Vanagon. Anyway this one had the
pop top, two rear facing bucket seats behind the driver and passenger
seats, a swing out table, and a three passenger rear seat. It pulled
into a parking lot, so of course Ihad to follow it in and check it out.
Glad I saw it again, cause that dealer had me convinced I had seen
an Unidentified Driving Object.
