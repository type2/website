Don't even think about it, Mark.

The Turbo Deisel and the Deisel engines look similar on the outside, but are
a lot different on the inside; you can't &quot;unbolt&quot; the turbo, and &quot;bolt it on&quot;
to the non-turbo and expect enduring service or good performance.

different heads, valves, seats, and gasket
lower initial compression ratio on turbo
different pistons
piston oil squirters on the connection rods
different fuel pump has &quot;boost valve&quot; to push extra fuel during boost; $$$$
for this!

Check the archives for Bob Bellanca's info on buying an &quot;industrial
application&quot; new TDi engine instead. $3,500 comes to mind. A much wiser
investment than investing your time trying to make one from scratch and still
only having about 70 hp.

best o' luck,
