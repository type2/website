&gt;I have a friend - a non-list member - who recently bought an '89 Vanagon 
&gt;that was equipped with alloy wheels.  As I recall from my Vanagon shopping 
&gt;days ('91 Westy) the alloy wheels, though gorgeous, had some pretty 
&gt;daunting care requirement/recommendations, such as weekly washing, 
&gt;avoiding certain detergents, etc, that were apparently related to 
&gt;corrosion problems.

Yeah, the corrosion &amp; maintenance problems are really, really bad.  Tell him
he should get rid of those alloys right away!  By the way, I, uh, uh, uh,
could be persuaded to take them off his hands (not that I'd want the
headaches of course) for a maybe uh, uh, $20. each or $50. if I was &quot;forced&quot;
to take the whole set.
