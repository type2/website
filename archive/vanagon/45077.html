Subject: Sincerest Apologies (was Re: '64 Deluxe Engine #?)

Me, being a bonehead, and confused the vanagon list with the vintagvw list
(doh!) wrote:

&gt;The VIN for the last 64 seems to be too low. I wrote to VW, and got the
following info on my '&gt;64 bug:

&gt;My VW was built on 18 November 1963
&gt;chassis # 5 932 883
&gt;engine # 8 165 219 (1200 40 bhp)

I was coffee challenged this morning, and I didn't notice what mailing list
I was reading. I've turned the vanagon list to digest mode to ensure this
won't happen again. My sincerest apologies to the list, and thank you for
being understanding and patient.
