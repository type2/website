Subject: Gotta Camper (Finally)

Welcome me to the ranks of camper owners.  I just purchased a 1985 Wolfsburg 
Camper. The body is in excellent condition, but I thinks the heads are toast.
The vehicle has only 96k. I going to pull the motor out of my 1984 sunroof 
van and put it in the camper. So I may have some spare parts for sale.

Also tomorrow I am going to look at an 1988 Vanagon with 45K miles. The man
said 
he ran something over with it. Don't know how bad it is but he told me he
only paid $150 for it and will take $300. I don't know why I even have to
look at it,
for that price who cares? I just hope it runs, I'd like to put the 2.1 in the 
camper instead. I'll let everyone know how it works out.
