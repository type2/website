Subject: EV screen update

info for those who asked about the EV screens:
the screens themselves appear to be well made, however I'd say the
Winnebago quality assurance needs a little work:

item: the top snaps are supposed to line up precisely with the holes
already in the frame - just remove the existing screws and screw in the
snaps. But no, the center snap is off by 1-2 inches requiring me to drill
another hole for it. This one goes into metal.

item: 2nd snap up from the bottom right doesn't exist. Is it a misprint in
the instructions or did they simply forget it? I'll see how well it works
without it - and maybe pick up a new snap down at the marina.

item: the measurements given for the base snaps are off. No big deal, as
once I have the rest of them in its better to just line up the bottom and
add the snaps to fit anyway.

item: the right side has a elastic band which wraps around the base of the
cup holder. They've thoughtfully provided a 1/4 inch spacer in the kit to
go between the wall and the cup holder so that this strap can get a better
grip. Unfortunately they forgot to include longer screws - the existing
screws barely grip the plastic with the spacer in there. I had to run to
the hardware store and find replacements 1/4 inch longer. No big deal, but
one more minor annoyance.

Now, the possibility exists that they sent me the screen for the 97 instead
of the 95, although they did ask me which one I wanted and I told them.
But still, the missing snap was mentioned in the instructions so I'm
inclined to think that they simply screwed up.

In any case, I only had to drill one new hole at the top, and I already had
the plastic drilled when I thought of this. Plus I didn't want to go
through the &quot;send it back, order another one, wait 4 more weeks&quot; hassle.
It's workable, just a minor pain.

Anyway, it's all together now, the door shuts with the screen in place,and
the whole thing looks very good.

The rear screen looks a lot easier to install - simply have to drill holes
for all 4 snaps!
