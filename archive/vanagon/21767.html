&gt;Could someone explain to me the difference between a wanabus and an unknown,
&gt;sniveling lurker?  Having owned 3 Vanagons in the past, I do wish to acquire
&gt;another one.  I guess you could say I want a Van again (groan...)

well ... :)
Wanabus - someone (like you) who does NOT currently have a micro/bus/vanagon/
          eurovan, but wants to get one in the future ... sometime. hopefully.

Unknown Sniveling Lurker - someone (not like you) who has yet to fess up as
          to what year/model/whatever bus they have or that they are a
          Wanabus. ;)
