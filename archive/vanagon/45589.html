Subject: Nuts!...Axle Nuts!


Ok...so far it is Ras Bulli Split --2, breaker-bar(s) --1!

As posted yesterday, I managed to get the passenger side rear axle nut
loose, and broke the breaker-bar on the other side... I took the bar
back to the FLAPS and they replaced it wit a 1/2&quot; drive bar
[apparently they no longer carry 3/4&quot; drive sockets and ratchets].  Of
course, I should have known better than to use the 1/2&quot; on the axle
nut, but I heated it again this morning [actually twice] and had
another round...I now have a second broken bar..:-(  They are just
going to love I at the FLAPS on Tuesday....

As for the nut, I actually thing that it has fused with the brake
drum.  The nut looks as though it was beat off/on the last time and
the break drum has bee struck with a hammer....it is actually burred
down over the nut [either that or some genius thought they would put a
spot weld on the nut/drum along one edge of the nut....

Does anyone out there have a 46mm axle nut for  a '67 kombi/westy?  I
am beginning to think that I will have to cut this one off...

Also, is there any chance that all this torking on the axle nut will
damage the shaft/reduction box/ or trannie?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
