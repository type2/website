&gt; What is the name of that stuff you &quot;slosh&quot; a gas tank with?

A couple of good brands advertise in Hemmings Motor News, I would
try one of those, make sure you first clean with acid to VW specs
like listed in the older Bentley manuals.  Also important to let
dry correctly less you glue down a gas float (which you may not
have, I haven't followed the year) also make sure the product
resists alcohol and other additives.
