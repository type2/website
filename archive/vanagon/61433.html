Yes it's a fan.

The reason it sounds like it's controlled by a thermostat is that it is
controlled by a thermostat.  If you look behind your fridge through the
access hole under the sliding window on that side, you will see a little
switch screwed into one of the fins with two wires going to it.  That
switch is a thermo switch, and turns on the fan when the fins get to a
certain temperature.  

The fan is always connected to 12v and therefore will come on when the fins
reach a certain temperature, whether or not the fridge is on (like on a hot
day with the windows rolled up).  

The fan blows air up over the fins at the back of the fridge to help heat
transfer, which in turn helps the fridge cool more efficiently.

Don't mess with it.  It's there for a reason.  Be thankful yours works :-)
.  The fan should be independent of the battery/water check switch.  It
probably is and it's just a coincidence yours came on at that second.  The
other folks who were with you obviously have problems with their fridge fan
if they don't hear it.  All the Vanagon Westy fridges have one.

&gt; I started using my fridge for the first time this weekend and became
somewhat
&gt; confused.  I plugged it in the night before we left, it was very cold.
&gt;  Switched to 12V for trip worked great again I then switched to propane
when
&gt; I arrived, no problems.  My question is about the switch located behind
my
&gt; drivers seat.  After listening to my radio I pulled the switch up to 
check
&gt; how much battery power was left, it was at this point that I heard what
&gt; sounded like a fan, behind the fridge start.  Is this fan important, if
that
&gt; is what I am hearing?  I was with two other Westy owners one had an 82
diesel
&gt; and the other had an 84 they told me that their fridges don't make any
noise.
&gt;  My fan or noise goes on for a little then it shuts off as if it is
&gt; controlled by a thermostat.  Will it hurt to run it without the switch,
to
&gt; the LED lights, in the on position.  I thought that maybe the fan is
blowing
&gt; across the condenser, if these things have one, and that maybe the fan
makes
&gt; the fridge more efficient but that it isn't necessary.  Any explanations
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.  I would really hate to hurt my fridge. 
Thanks
&gt; in advance.
