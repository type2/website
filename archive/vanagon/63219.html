&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt;     I have found a vanagon which I am interested in buying, but I first want
&gt; to make sure that the fix-ups I'll have to do to it aren't going to cost me an
&gt; arm and a leg.

     I just installed a rear bed from a 1986 to a 1986. This can be a bolt
     in thing, depending on how prefect you want it. Everything lines up
     but the 2 pins that support the rear of the seat back. The existing
     pins along with the welded in plates have to be moved foreward about
     5 inches. I removed the plates from the doner van so if I remove the
     bed I can install the old seat. Moving the plates with pins can be
     bolt in, rather than welding, but welding is much stronger. What
     we found strange was that both were 1986 models and the plates
     still weren't in the other. GO Figure....

&gt;     I am interested in installing a Weekender-style pull out bed.  Is this
&gt; possible (the van is a 84) ?  Are the fittings the same for the normal seat
&gt; and the puul-out seat ?  Has anyone done this ?
&gt;
&gt;     The rear bumper is missing, and I was quoted &gt; $800 for a new one.  Will I
&gt; have trouble finding a good bumper at the junk yard, and how involved is it to
&gt; replace this ?
&gt;
&gt;     Thanks in advance for any advice !
&gt;
