&gt;         I just spotted an advertisement in the swedish magazine Classic
&gt; Motor Magasin. The add describes it as a &quot;reservkraftmotor (industrial
&gt; motor) with only 100 hours usage. Sounds a bit to good to be true. Anyway,
&gt; the phone number is Sweden (in Ronneby) 70-8136891 and ask for Ingvar.

Whats interesting, is I saw 25hp dist caps last weekend for sale, for $10
each, which is a bargain.  I picked one up and looked inside, and it only
had 2 of the 4 spark plug contacts for the rotor!  I asked the guy what
the deal was, and he said it was for some sort of industrial motor.  Anyone
ever heard of these?
