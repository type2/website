Subject:      Vanagon Gone!

The list,

Last night I swapped a 7 year Love affair
with my Vanagon, for a payed up attorney's
bill. I'm sick. I couldn't watch it drive away.
The buyer promised to take care of it. Dam the
bitch that force this. I think life will
eventually take care of her. Hopefully my
other Vanagon can take it's place. I never
new a person could cause so much trouble.
Everything that I owed money on, the courts didn't
want to talk about, but the Vanagon was payed
for, becuase I wanted to insure it's security.
If I would have owed money on it, I would still
have it. I'm not sure if anything could have been
done but maybe someone can learn from this.

AND GET THIS...NOW THE BITCH DROPPED THE CHARGES.
