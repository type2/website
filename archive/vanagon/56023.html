Subject: Re: Clarification on non-GL Campers 

There are 3 'models' at play here..


1) Weekender option, fold down rear seat, tilt back on centre seats, maybe
curtains. nothing else for camping

2) Multivan:  poptop, lower fold out bed+cabinets in rear/roof, and two rear
facing jumpseats, with a small 12V cooler under one of them, and a wall table

3)Westy:  any and all Westies have a full kitchen.  The Bentley manual is
clear enough on this to show the difference between basic and GL versions.
Both had water tanks/sinks etc.


I am guessing that the large fridge in lieu of one jump seat was a Multivan
option.  The Multivans up here are badged with 'Multivan' on rear hatch.
Weekender was an option (not a production model) prior to '88, and no
'weekender' badge was on hatch, likely 'GL' only.  In '88 the rear bed/seat
was fitted to all GL models.  Why all the concern anyhoo? Tim
