&gt; If we decide to stay at Red Rock, what about (Al, Dave, are you listening)
&gt; everying mailing in their money ahead of time to the list member who
&gt; expects to arrive there first, and the letting them prepay all our
&gt; spaces.  Do you think Ranger Rick or whatever his name is would
&gt; allow the buddy system of we flashed good, cold, hard $$$ at him?   :)

I think we will be able to get enough sites if several of us arrive early
Friday.  Scott Harvey and I will be arriving before noon on Friday.
What we need to determine is:

Is anyone else going to arrive before, say, 3pm on Friday??
-----------------------------------------------------------

If a few are, I think we will be okay, as the latecomers can double up
with the early arrivals, who will each snag a site.  PLEASE let either
Martha or I know if you are planning on arriving early, so we can try
to decide whether to keep the trip at Red Rock.

Thanks,
