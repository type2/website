Subject: New way to bleed wasserboxer?


&gt;While checking for exhaust gases in my coolant, I got lots of air in the
&gt;system.  I have not enjoyed following the bleeding procedure in Bentley,
&gt; kind of like doing taxes.  Since I was by myself, I tried a different
&gt;approach this time.  Elevated the front of the van like before.  Ran the
&gt;engine and revved it up several times to make sure bubbles got circulated.  
&gt;Then I opened the bleeder screw on the radiator while the engine continued to
&gt;idle.  I found some small gauge nylon tubing(used for a oil presssure gauge

Regarding the bleeder screw, I was wondering if one couldn't mount some
kind of pressure valve in place of the screw that would work somewhat
like a one of those over-heating valves on a water heater.  To test
them, you lift up on the trigger and if it hisses, its working.  I
think something like that with a flexible hose routed down near the
lower part of the car would be nice for bleeding the system. 

Oh well, just thinking out loud....  :)
