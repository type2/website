    &gt;Also, any clever fixes for floor holes (not really huge) that
    &gt;won't require replacing the floor?
    
    Try laying up some fiberglass over them.  Its worked for me
    wonderfully before.

I've used lots of fiberglass, though not on
my current bus (which I am doing right in
every way).  My prior bug and squarebacks (n=3)
have been very nearly all fiberglass in some
regards.  I probably overdid it with the last
squareback -- when I gave up on glass and
consulted a welder, his ministrations cured
my by then significant shimmy...

       other than rust and who cannot imagine
       why salt is to be preferred over chains
