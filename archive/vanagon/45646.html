Subject: Re: 64 Headligh switch

I had my fuse box out and a friend put it back in before road trip from
Idaho to Portland in my '64.  At dusk, with a load of hitch-hikers, I turned
on the headlights.  The motor died.  Lights off, motor back on.  Turned out
that the little metal clamp that holds the fuse box was touching the fuse
for the headlights - on the battery side.  So no fuse protection - just
shorted out the battery.  Took me a while to find the problem, but there's
only so many wires in a old bus.
