Subject: FS - '91 Vanagon Carat

Hi everyone,
I was filling up (in 14 degree temp) at a Sunoco station when I noticed a 
very cherry 91 Vanagon Carat.  I thought some of you may be interested.
These guys go to car auctions and occasionally pickup some nice vans.

here goes:

For Sale in Pittsford NY (outside of Rochester)

ask for Paul or Wally 

1991 VW Vanagon Carat
Color is maroon with small pinstripe
Interior is light gray
78K miles, Automatic
Extra Clean
They are asking $11,000
----------
I checked it out further and it has these options
Near new Kleber tires
Air conditioning
Power Mirrors
Power Door locks
Power Windows
and Cruise Control
There is also a nice VW factory cassette deck
Two rear facing seats
a fold out table
and the rear bench seat
It's sitting on the lot and its been cold in western NY but it 
started it in 14 degreeeeeee temp and it kicked in right away
----------
Oh yeah there was a hand saw on the floor, it might be an extra option 
 to jam the gas pedal or someting ;-)
----------
Good luck hope this helps someone.

Joel
