     Here is a compilation of the data I have collected, some
     of it posted earlier.

     First, here's how the factory endowed water cooled Vanagons look:

     Engine         HP:SAE_at_RPM    Torque:FTLB_at_RPM     Notes

     2.1l           90_at_4800           117_at_3200        Slow
     1.9l           82_at_4800           105_at_2600        Slower
     Diesel         48_at_4200            97_at_2000        Slowest


     Here are some practical(?) options among 5cyl VW/Audi Engines:

     Engine         HP:SAE_at_RPM   Torque_at_RPM  Notes

     Audi Diesel       67_at_4800      86_at_3000   2.0l, '79-'81
     Audi TurboD       84_at_4500     127_at_2800   2.0l, '82-'83
     Quantum          110_at_5500     122_at_3000   2.2l,8.5:1,&quot;KX&quot;,year unk
     Quantum Syncro   115_at_5500     126_at_3000   2.2l,8.5:1,&quot;JT&quot;,year unk
     Audi Gas         130_at_5600     140_at_4000   2.3l,CFI,'89-91,10:1,&quot;NF&quot;
     Audi TurboG      157_at_5500     166_at_3000   2.2l,mid '88,&quot;MC&quot;,7.8:1
     Audi TurboG      166_at_5500     177_at_3000   2.2l,late '88-90,&quot;MC&quot;,8.5:1
     Audi TurboG      217_at_5700     228_at_1950   2.2l,20V,'91,&quot;3B&quot;,Hoo-boy!

     There are several early-mid '80s Audi 5 cyl engines that I do not
     have, but I think this is a good representative sampling. As a
     caution, much of this data was compiled from my collection of Bentleys
     and by other people on the net, and there may be errors.

     So those are the facts. Here are some humble opinions:

     The turbodiesel makes the most sense for those that want a diesel,
     look at that 127ftlbs of torque!

     The &quot;NF&quot; Audi engine looks the best of the normally aspirated gas
     engines. It can be rechipped to gain other 10% or so for about $500.
     Also, note the relatively high rpm for maximum torque. For me,
     4000rpm in top gear is something over 70mph-just about the speed I'd
     like to maintain when I climb hills/mountains on the Interstate. On
     the other hand, it is only a 20% increase over the stock 2.1l. How
     much would this help?

     Of the gas turbos, I'll take any of them! All can be easily modified
     to performance like the 3B version by changing chips and
     wastegate springs, and still maintain outstanding reliability. These
     puppies run hot, however. The turbo is watercooled (many auto turbos
     are just out in the air), and the intercooler sucks up so much air the
     radiators (there are two) are pushed over to one side of the grill.
     There are also separate cooling ducts bringing air to critical
     elements, like the alternator. However, I predict no problems with
     enough heat in the bus during the winter.

     Your comments, please.
