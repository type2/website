Subject: Another: Considering a 59 single cab purchase

&gt;I am considering purchasing a 59 single cab that is in reasonably good shape
&gt;and has a running origional engine and good tranny. 


I am still in the consideraton stage at this point.  I talked to the fellow
last night and he said that he is sending a video of the truck for my
inspection. He did mention that the gas tank is rusted out and needed
replaced or repaired, so I was wondering what model years I could swap with,
The idiot manual didnt help much.

Thanks for all previous help!!!
