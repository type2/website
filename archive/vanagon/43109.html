IT RAINED.

There isn't much else.  Quite a few buses though not many nice splits
as a rule a bunch of bays, cool for me a bay lover.  One or two nice
split campers, a '8? 2wd double cab.  Lots of bugs, very few &lt;10 ghias
maybe 3 verts, 4-5 Things, a 412.  Swap meet pretty poor a lot of junk
IMHO.
Went looking for a tent primarily.  For unknown reason bought a mint
BA-4 gas heater for $75 after looking all round the swap area for a
tent.
Only one was for earlier buses, orange and white striped, looked pretty
beat and idiot was asking $450, yeah right.  Got round to looking at the
buses and a guy was just taking down the proper drive-away for a late
70's he had sitting by his Vanagon.  Complete, clean, beautiful, he had
just sold it for $275 to a guy that had asked him about it and as it
really
didn't fit the Vanagon he was tired of it. AAARHAAGH.  I could have
killed something.  Right about that time it began to really put down the
rain so I took off.  MOFOCO, WCM, somebody selling Neuspeed for H20
freaks, a bunch of big vendors were there.  Otherwise it was standard
try to sift through the trash.  Only T4 parts I saw were a set of 1700
pistons, cam, crank, and D-jetronic distributor from a 914.  My luck 
I was looking for the one without the injection points.  Still picked up
the heater, 2 German engine mounts at $5 each and a front spare mount
for $5 so not a total loss.  I could have killed the guy for the tent
though.
Just my luck I guess.  Also had to pass on an NOS VW rear hitch for
early
bays for $30, in the box just didn't think it would fit the late bay
easily, and
as I compared it to a guys '71 he became interested so I let him have
it.
Quite a few buses for sale,  2 deluxe splits, one real ragged, one OK.
A '91 Syncro for $7500 with 118k, I picked up the guys card but lost it.
Some weird buses present a real neat EV with 18&quot; alloys and a bunch of
ProjectZwo body and suspension mods.  A EV camper that was not by
Winnebago, Canadian in manufactur I think.  A canadian '80s panel van
and the afore mentioned vanagon truck.  A spiltty firetruck in OK shape
needed some work. A lot of FWD cars now days, place littered with show
and go Corrado's of course DC is in general, a lot of GTI's and even a
Fox
wagon, had a stereo worth more than the fox easily. VW had a TDI stting
there running, checked it out, figue they'll sell 1 or 2 in the US for
the price, 
pretty neat though but hell Ford has had the DI truck for like 2 years
haven't
they? Took my picture in a Concept Crap mock up close as I'll ever get
to one
of them if indeed we ever see them.  And got a free Driver's Wanted
T-shirt for
signing up for a VW Visa card, probably will be a neat momento of
another
failed VW add campaign.

An OK event I gues but IT REALLY RAINED.
