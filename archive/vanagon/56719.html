Well, they are available but you won't be laughing when you hear the
prices! Gene Berg' shop will sell you a stroker forged crank for your
wasserboxer; around $1600 if I recall correctly. They also say they can
get some Mahle oversized p&amp;c sets, though there is no price in the
catalog. Look up the number in the archived vendors lists, ask to speak
to Tim,  he knows the vanagon stuff. They also offer an electronic fuel
injection setup that you can optimize with a laptop while you drive
around in real conditions!

Similar things are available from suppliers in Germany, there should be
a thread on Anhendorf (sp?) in the archives about eighteen months ago.
I have one of their catalogs, seems like it was about $6K for 
a cranks and P&amp;C kit, something like 2.5 liters. 

This is why there are so many Subaru threads...but the fact is that
parts *are* available to increase the displacement of the wasserboxer
engines.
