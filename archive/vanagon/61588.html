Subject: RE: short in headlight wiring ... somewhere

I finally got around to fixing this and I want to thank the folks who
responded.  In particular, Dennis Haynes, who called it perfectly ...

&gt;The ground wire for the headlights has lost it's connection.  Probably burned
&gt;at the connection by the fuse box.  Check the two round ground connectors.
&gt;Both Headlights are grounded at the same terminal.  It is the one that is
&gt;obviously overheated.

In my case, one of the ground connectors was quite rusty so I managed to clean
it and all the connectors attached to it.  I guess its time to get serious
about that windshield leak-proofing job.

This list is wonderful.
