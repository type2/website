Subject: RE: Lack of clutch Action

Since the weather today was reasonable( high of 40 with no wind) i 
decided to change both cyl. I had bought both Sat at a Import parts 
house for $140 with tax.

The only real glitch was taking off the hose from the master cyl. 
Instead of the hose coming of the fitting the whole fitting came out. As 
a result I wasnt able to block the hose with a handy bolt, etc and the 
whole resevoir drained. Once both cyl were changed the bleeding process 
took longer than the cyl replacement due to the amount of fluid lost 
from the resevoir.

All is well now and I'm no longer shiftless.

Thanks for the comments. Total repair time (less bleeding was about 2.5 
hours. Big hands in small places.
