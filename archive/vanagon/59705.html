Subject: RE:consumer reports


Sure, Consumer Reports is not biased....however not being biased also means 
one is dispassionate....and there's the problem. The car's that usually get 
the high ratings by CR are those car's which are very 
&quot;appliance-like&quot;...hardly the type of cars with which one becomes 
&quot;passionate&quot; about.

I'll take a car that I can be passionate about, a car that has &quot;personality&quot; 
over an appliance any day!!! I suspect that's why the rest of us are on this 
list....because we're passionate. Have you ever seen a list or newsgroup for 
Toyota Corollas?????

Give me my '56 beetle, my EuroVan, or hell, my former, sometimes running 78 
MG Midget over ANY automobile CR endorses anyday!!
