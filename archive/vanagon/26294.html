  Just a reminder for those folks on the east coast-
This weekend, the faithful will be gathering at William B. Umstead State
Park, in Raleigh.
I will be there Saturday afternoon, staying on overnight in this lovely,
crisp fall weather.
No rain on tap, so feel free to join us. It will be a lovely thing, Ido
believe!
See you there!
Richard
