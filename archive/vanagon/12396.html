Subject: RE: 911 motor in a VW transporter

I have already bored both lists with how great and relatively easy this
is.  Mine is an 81 Vanagon with a 77 2.7liter engine.  The only 
specialized part I used was the flywheel.  Everything else you need is 
either Porsche (e.g. oil tank), or homebrew (e.g. engine tin).  If you
have specific questions, let me know, and help me guess whether the
answers will be of interest to the 'philes and/or Vanagon lists at
large.
