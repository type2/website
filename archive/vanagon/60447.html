&gt; Anyone know how to adjust the windshield washer so they don't fill up the roof carrier
&gt; instead of hit the windshield?

The windshield washer jet is actually a ball and can be rotated. Get a
small pin or needle; inset it into the jet hole about 3/16&quot;; rotate ball
to relocate the washer spray direction.

I use a drawing pin and keep it permanently in the carpet pile above the
left foot rest (dead pedal).
