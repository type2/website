Subject: Bought an '88 (cheap)

Well, I hooked up a gas can to to fuel pump, cranked the motor over and
it STARTED!!. This weekend it goes in my new camper which I hope to take to
Williamsburg in a couple of weeks. It should give me plenty of time to get
the bugs out. Does anyone know any pitfalls of putting a 2.1 in an earlier van.

Thanks.
