Subject: Re: Vintage wiper blade source (east)


steve:

don't think there are too many sources on the east coast for rubber steve.
they all seem to be either in the west coast. You might try Gordi Davis _at_
4Ever4 in Marlow, NH, or United German Impotants ( i think they are in
Penn.)

Another place you might try is Das Bulli Haus in Conn. It is run by Clay
and Mary Smith. Mary is on this discussion group and can be reached at:

MCLADM2_at_UConnVM.UConn.Edu

BTW, Rocky Mountain Motorworks has a 1-800 number you could probably get
those wiper blades shipped to you for a nominal fee.
