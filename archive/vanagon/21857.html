Subject: NE Philly and other new pics on web!

G'day,

Cetin Seren sent me 4 pix taken at the not so recent N.E. Philly gathering
of vanagon-listmembers. Check' em out at the URL given below (go ahead,
don't be shy! It's on company time anyway... :)  )

I also added some captions to old Busses by the Arch pictures. And there
are new pix taken on the early leg of GNATT. If you have more GNATT
pictures to submit, you're welcome to send 'em this way.

And there are also 2 photos of my '75 bus, one showing how I carefully
massaged additional gauges into the dash for that bitchin' sano look ;-)
(don't do it!) and one displaying those solar panels I've been talking
about. 

Have an enjoyable Monday!
