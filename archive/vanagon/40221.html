Subject: rusty front axle

hi-

I was driving home the other night when I hit a rather small pothole,
nothing to be concerned about, when I heard a terrible noise and the front
end of my 78 started to pull. I got out and looked underneath and realized
that the support on the drivers side of the front axle beam was totally
rusted out and had broke. :-( I was wondering what year(s) front beam will
fit my bus. I am going to start combing the junkyards on payday. Any info
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
