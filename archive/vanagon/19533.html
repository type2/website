Subject: RE: Broken Vanagon slider han...


Joe Kyle sez:

Now, considering that I'm reading up on sillicon bronze casting right now, this  
is a somewhat interesting idea to me.  Since I'd be using sand casting rather 
than a lost wax process, I am a bit worried about the splines coming out 
cleanly.

I must admit that I am a bit intrigued by the idea of &quot;vanadium steel false 
teeth&quot; ---  which would probably come in handy when eating a steak cooked by my 
mother...

|When we encounter a poorly designed part, and the only replacement is
|ridiculously expensive and probably no stronger than the original, we should
|organize a small group to obtain one good part, make a mold to produce a wax
|casting, the use the lost-wax process to produce a hundred or so out of
|vanadium steel by investment casting, passing the cast-but-unfinished part
|along to other van owners for whatever it takes to cover out of pocket
|expenses.
|
|Making this idea work is no more difficult than producing knoves in wholesale
|lots (and also works for false teeth).
