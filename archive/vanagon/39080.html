Hey all,
Sorry to prolong this non-VW thread, but this is one of my favorites:

I caught you knocking at my cellar door.
I love you baby.  &quot;Can I have some more?&quot;
Oh, the damage done.

I hit the city and I lost my band.
I watched the needle take another man.
Gone, gone.  The damage done.

I sing this song because I love the man.
I know that some of you don't understand.
Milk blood to keep from running out.

I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone.
But every junkie's like a setting sun.

				--Neil Young
