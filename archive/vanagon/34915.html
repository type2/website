I have owned a 1984 since new, and it now has over 200k mi on the orig 
untouched engine and i used non vw/autobahn antifreeze in it for 12 years.
The trick is to change it often(2 years max) and maintain your vehicle.My
vanagon routinely makes 5000 mi trips every winter and without a drop of
oil or  h2o  used.ED
