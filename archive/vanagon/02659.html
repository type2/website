&gt; &gt;Speaking of removing my bus steering wheel and putting it in the oven
&gt; &gt;at 300 degrees for thirty minutes, umm,
&gt; 
&gt; why? why, uncle Carl? why are you doing this? huh? huh? huh? huh, carl?
&gt; why are you doing this? huh? :)

Well, given that the bus is already painted like a brick wall, has a
fireplace (heh) painted on the back, and has smiley-face hubcaps, aren't
you just a little horrified at what I might have in mind for the plastic 
interior parts %-) ???  

Anyway, I'll be poking around under the bus this weekend to see if I the
steering/alignment are in order, then I go after the wheel, start up the
ol' food processor, heat up the oven...

see y'all,
