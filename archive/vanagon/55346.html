Subject: Ebberschlaber heater don't work...

 I have never had this heater working and I would really like for it to
work. I am tired of bundleing up to drive anywhere. I can't tell if it has
spark or if there is any juice going to the coil. I don't know anything
about these things but if there was juice going to the coil wouldn't the
fuel pump for the heater be working too?  any help would be appreciated.
