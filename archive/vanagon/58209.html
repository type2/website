Subject: Info on Vanagon 5 Speeds 

Hi All,

I talked with Weddle Engineering yesterday on the subject of Vanagon 5
speeds.  According to their information, only 50 Vanagons sold in the US
market had the 5-speed option.  On the Diesels, there were a few thousand,
but most were 4 speeds.  The Syncros are considered 4 speeds &amp; granny low,
not a true 5-speed.  Most of the 5 speed(gas) Vanagons were sold in Europe
and South Africa.  The 5 speed gear ratios work well with the Audi 5
cylinder powered Vanagons sold in South Africa.  Weddle Engineering
imports these 5 speeds, usually used, and rebuilds them to customers'
specifications as needed, around $2000 I believe with a 4-speed core.
