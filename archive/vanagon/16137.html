Subject: Re: ASBESTOS in VWs

The only parts in my VW van that I know denfinitely contain asbestos are 
the exhaust gaskets and the brake friction materials.  BUT no one can tell 
if a material contains asbestos just by looking at it; the fibers are very 
small.  You should be able to have a material tested for asbestos using polarized light microscopy and 
a certified analyst for about $20.00.  Check the yellow pages under 
analytical labortories and asbestos.

Asbestos was banned for use in most materials in the late 1970s; however, 
it is still used in some parts (ie some brakes) today, and is widely used 
in other countries.

It is safer to wet a suspected asbestos-containing material when 
disturbing it to help supress dust.  NEVER use compressed air to blow off 
brake parts.
