Subject: Re: Tires

&gt; I am assuming that your Yohohamas are Y370 LT 195 75/R14.  
&gt; On summer pavement I used 43 psi front and 53 psi rear. Harry Yates of
&gt; Langley, BC, Canada loves these tires and I bought mine based on his
&gt; reports. He informed me that he uses 45 psi front and 53 psi rear. Both
&gt; of you are using a 10 psi difference. I think I'll try the same.

I also bought mine based on Harry's reports (and others) and have 
found about 10psi difference works best. At the moment I just have 2 
on the rear until I wear out/destroy the Conti on the front. (I've 
had 2 flats in 6 months, both on the Conti)
