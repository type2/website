Subject: gopher access to archives back up

The list archives have not been propogating to the gopher since October
14th because the sysadmin made some changes which didn't get reflected in
all the scripts that run the gopher stuff. 

Please accespt my apologies.
The gopher should be updated daily and the search index should be rebuilt 
daily.   If someone sees this not happening, I'd really like to be 
notified as soon as possible.

Thanks.
