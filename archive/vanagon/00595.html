Subject: Temp guages and switches.

On the subject of engine temperature, I discovered this weekend while 
breaking my right side rear view mirror and finding out if the electric 
radiator cooling fan even works and trying to figure out how to stop a 
rattle in my A/C fan that turning the A/C fan on also turns on the 
radiator cooling fan.  As such, I realized that I don't have to do any 
rewiring .. if I want the radiator fan on, I can just turn the A/C fan 
on.  Even if my A/C weren't disconnected, I could just NOT turn the A/C 
on at the same time.  I'm to the point that I trust my temperature guage. 
It's seemed very stable (much more so than my gas guage &lt;roll eyes&gt;&lt;grin.).

By the way, the best price I could find for a replacement mirror (glass only)
was $20.  Anyone else bought one for a better price? (go ahead...break my 
heart).
