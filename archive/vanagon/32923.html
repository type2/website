&gt;Cold weather brings home the problem of the voltage drop in the long wiring
&gt;runs common to a Volkswagen bus.  If you want reliable starts and brighter
&gt;headlights you need to know more about heavier gauge main buss wiring and the
&gt;use of relays.  You are the mechanic-in-charge of your vehicle.  Sometimes
&gt;that calls for you to be an electrician as well.

For the past twelve months, my 90 Westy has experienced starting problems.  I
would turn the key and nothing happens - just like a dead battery, except all
the dash lights would go on so I know it is not a dead battery.  There is no
click when I turn the key - just silence.

Usually it catches the second time and the odd times, on the third try.  VW
have looked at it while it was in for servicing a couple of times but they said
that they could not find anything.  

Is it because of what you say above?  Does this mean that I do as you suggest,
I just have to live with it?  Will it get worse as time goes by and reach a
point where it will not start at all?  This can't be, can it?
