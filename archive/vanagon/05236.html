Subject: Hoping to buy a hauler, single or double cab.

	Hi,
	I just got added to this list.
	I've decided that I need a hauler for all the yard work and 
similar stuff I'm doing. And being a serious VW fan, I'm going to
try and make it one of my favorite brand.
	So I'm saving my pennies, and asking my friends to keep their
eyes open for VW Bus/Transporter/Vanagon Pickup Trucks, single or double cab. 
They're not all that common, but they do exist, and that's what I'm hoping 
to find. I'm checking out the Vintage VW Owner's Assoc. and the two 
Transporter clubs too. 
	Second option, of course, is a Rabbit Pickup, which is
probably more practical, but maybe a little less romantic. I dig busses,
and I've always wanted a crew cab- sweet dreams!  

	So if you see any year VW Bus Pickup for sale in the Northern 
California area, would you let me know? And if you know someone who just 
sold, or bought one, could you put me in contact with them, or find out 
for me what the sale price was and general condition of the vehicle? 

	Finally, as if I'm not already asking a lot, if you see a 
Rabbit Pickup for sale, or know of a recent sale, I'd be interested in
the price. The SF Chron has a 1980 turbo diesel for $2250. Right now I'm
just trying to find out what the market is.

	What I'm hoping to find is the proverbial single owner, original
factory paint, low milage, 1971 or later double cab with an asking price in
the $3K to $6K range. Since wanting doesn't cost anything, an after-1976
model with FI &amp; catalytic converter would be even nicer, and a waterpumper
Vanagon double cab would be best of all. Obviously a lot of this is
negotiable. But I know myself well enough to have not even looked
at a 67 double cab with no engine and &quot;90% of the body pannels&quot; that I
recently found in the newspaper.

	If nothing turns up before January, then I'll start looking at 
Rabbit pickups...

	I'd be happy to do the same favor for anyone else, and of course,
provide the story so far to anyone who's interested.

	One question I have that this group might be able to answer is 
which model year Canadian spec Vanagon pickups can be legally imported
into this country? I remember a dealer in Idaho who was bringing low-milage
&quot;used&quot; ones over the border- they used to advertize in DB&amp;HVW but they
aren't in the current issue...

	Counting the vw-porsche 914, this will be my 6th VW, and could be my
4th aircooled, so I do know what I'm getting into- I guess I just
don't have an water/air mixing problem... :-)
