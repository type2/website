Steve, I'm no expert (but getting smarter about this every day,
unfortunately) but  I've been told this condition does not turn your engine
into a hand grenade waiting to go off. It will, however, limit the
long-term life (mileage) of the engine.

The defect is covered under VWs 5 yr/50,000 mile powertrain warranty. That
means they'll fix it for free. I'd recommend you contact your dealer before
reaching 50k miles and have them check it out. I'm thinking this problem is
probably more widespread than suspected.

Jeff
