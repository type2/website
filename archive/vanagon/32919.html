So Cindy B. Boland says:
&gt; Thinking about biying a '91 Vanagon GL sight unseen from a 
&gt; private owner in Alabama (thanks to the e-mail from Joel Walker 
&gt; at U of A).
&gt; 
&gt; Being very novice about all of this what should I be asking the 
&gt; owner
&gt; 

Sounds like a pretty good price but....  The trouble with talking
to the owner over the phone is that s/he can tell you anything 
they want.  So by the time you get there or have the van delivered,
it's not all what they described it to be.  I think an easier solution
would be to persuade 'kind-hearted' Joel into taking a gander at
the vehicle and see what he thinks.  Of course, the draw-back to
that is he may decide to buy it himself! ;)
