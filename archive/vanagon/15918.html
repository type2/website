&gt;I think this discussion has convinced me I need a tach.  I have been
&gt;thinking that instead of paying $70 for that nice VDO tach that everyone
&gt;has, I would
&gt;try to find one in a junkyard.  Maybe one from a Porsche 914, but those
&gt;are awfully big.  Has anyone installed a tach from another car into their Van?

i got a tach out of a scirocco and hand-fitted it into the 80 vanagon i had
... i don't recommend it for the faint-of-heart: it was a pain. but it had
the correct fuel gauge (and an extraneous water-temp gauge) and i finally
got it to work. be really careful of the needle ... i wound up with two tachs
because of the ease of the needle in bending. :(  but at $20 each, it wasn't
so bad $-wise. lots of fitting, though.

you vanagon types know that the later vanagons have a tach as standard,
right? it might be possible to fit it to an earlier vanagon, and hand-wire
it to the coil and power/ground (instead of needing that printed-circuit
foil in the instrument pod).
