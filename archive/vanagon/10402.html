Subject:  Synchro bucking and heaving

 hi folks. I've posted my story on the resistor solder joint computer
 fix for a bucking and heaving Synchro to my GEnie PSRT RoundTable
 as #1008 HACK84.PDF. Its in Adobe Acrobat format. WeIf you don't already
 have one, we have readers available for the cost of downloading.
 
 Separately, where can I buy a clean late model Synchro&gt;? Preferably
 difflock, Southwest, and private?
