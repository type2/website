Ok...I decided not to chase co-eds this afternoon. Taught my Computer
Law class, did all the department-chair-shit I could handle....Its
72 degrees, breezy, low humidity....SUNNY! Snuck out the door...
got in the bug...drove home.

Time to get ready for the weekend and load the EuroVan for its 
maiden camping voyage....

I think I feels a song commin' on




What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' goy (in honor of this bein Yom Kipper)
Now I'm lost in a daydream
Packin the EuroVan for Busses by the Bouy....


Hey, whatdaya want for nuthin?  ...... Rubber bisket?

Now I ask you who can ID the above quote?



Well time to log off, and play with the EV!

Ric
