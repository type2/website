Subject: Re: [WTB] Rocker Panels, 72'...

Try MPS on Laperriere Ave., 728-3778

&gt;  I am tackling the body of my 72' these next few weeks, and I'm
&gt; wondering if anyone has or knows where I can get rocker panels (inner
&gt; and outer, both sides). Whitney seems like a rip-off (maybe just CAN$
&gt; exchange rate?!), and I don't trust off-shore (maybe someone can
&gt; convince me otherwise!). Its true, this is a shot in the dark, but I
&gt; really want to get rid of all that crusty metal and make my Bus look
&gt; shiney new.
