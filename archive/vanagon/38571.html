Subject: sagging rear suspension

Dear list,
  someone suggested recently a couple of coil spring adjusters as a cheap
fix for the &quot;sagging rear end&quot; syndrome. Is that a good way to go or are
there drawbacks ? I'm asking 'cause J.C. Witless has them on sale for a few
bucks a pair...I understand one needs 2 per coilspring ???
