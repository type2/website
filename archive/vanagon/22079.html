While I wasn't there vfor the net talsk with arlo... I was passing through
West Virginia in late June this year and arlo was performing at a folk
festival. The newspapers said ( we coudn't stay for the show) that he was
going to perform the full Alice's Restuaunt, in it's entirety  to be
recordede for release of a forthcoming anniversary edition. If ya'll kneww
about this, then I just got my two finger excersize for the day. Peace.
