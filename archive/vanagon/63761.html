Subject: NEW: Plexi Headlight Covers, Vanagon/Eurovan
Date: Tue, 12 Aug 1997 19:32:28 -0400

One of my suppliers just sent me a couple samples of these, and wants me to
start selling them.  They are plexiglass headlight covers, available for a
Eurovan or '86-up Vanagon, in your choice of  smoked (dark tinted) or
clear.  They clip on or off in about two seconds, no drilling or adapting
required.  The supplier sent me a smoked Vanagon one and a clear Eurovan
one, so if anyone would like these particular ones they're available right
away (otherwise allow a few weeks for delivery, as for now I'll probably
order them as needed).  Price is $39.95 per pair.  I tried the smoked
Vanagon ones on my '89.  While I doubt the safety/legality of using the
smoked ones at night anyway, they sure looked good in the daylight (and, I
think, would look really sharp in conjunction with a bra).  Also, they'd
probably protect those expensive square Vanagon headlights from stone chips
and cracks.   If anyone's interested, please p-mail me.

Thanks,
