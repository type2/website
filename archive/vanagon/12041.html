&gt;I bought my 85 Vanagon about a year and a half ago.  The AC has never
&gt;worked and I am interested in getting it up and running again.  Any
&gt;suggestions as to the least stupid strategy to attain this goal?  I
&gt;merely want some guidelines to assist me when the dealer begins to take
&gt;full advantage of my ignorance  ;-).  Many thanks.

well ... it's almost a certainty that you'll need a new dryer. if the system
has been opened to the air at all, the dryer is probably wasted. they ain't
cheap. but you probably can find one at other-than-the-dealer.

the next thing would be the compressor, i guess. it might have to be rebuilt
or replaced, depending on the condition of the seals and the bearings. it
might be worth taking the car to an a/c specialist and getting a &quot;thorough
inspection&quot; before you let the dealer see it. i.e., get some independent's
ideas about what exactly has gone wrong. problem is, they'll likely charge
you half-an-arm for the inspection. all the a/c-related labor and parts and
chemicals has gone through the roof down here. since &quot;spring&quot; is right round
the corner, maybe look in the paper for some &quot;intro special&quot;??

p.s. while you are at it, be sure to clean off the little evaporator/
condensor (radiator-looking thing up front) ... they get dirty and lose
efficiency. a water hose and a soft brush can make a lot of difference on
how well the system works.  good luck.
