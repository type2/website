On my way to this AM, I stopped by the arches for some grub and
there's this gut there with an early bus.  He must have been a helicopter
pilot previously because there were no doors on this thing!

Anyway, I go to talk to him, and it turns out that he restores Porsches!
He found it quite interesting that I was driving a prosche and restoring
a Bus!

So he's telling me how he has a bunch of Porsche parts for sale, and I'm
telling him how I have a bunch of bus parts for sale.  Namely - doors!

Just one of life's little happenings.

Thom
