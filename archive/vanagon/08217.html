I bled my 84 vanagon lifters a couple of times so far. After bleeding when
the engine was first started the lifter noise seemed worse than before
bleeding. I immediately disassembled everything to bleed all lifters all over
once again and then realized what happened.

When each lifter was being reinstalled the engine had to be turned to make
the initial adjustments. When the engine was turned, some already installed 
lifters got compressed. The compression caused some oil to be pressed out of 
some lifters. So when you completed the installation of all lifters actually
some if not all lifters got worse. Oil got pumped back in only after when the
engine was restarted and idle for some time. The noise went away when finally 
all lifters got enough oil and became firm enough.

If the car is parked for a long time some lifters may lose oil. Upon
starting the lifter noise will again worry you. Bleed again? A good question
for Joel.
