&gt; '95?) ever going to make it into the archive?  I *have* heard from Vanagon

Actually, what Don sent me was from January 1995. And, although the 
article is long, it's not really about the practicalities of fixing car 
computers, but rather a lot about philosophy and theory.  Here's the 
pertinent part of the article.

                         Servicing Intermittents
   My 1987 Synchro 4WD van started showing an intermittent and a 
total loss of power. Naturally, I did not suspect for an instant that 
all those 138,000 off road desert miles I put on it had anything to do 
with the problem.
  Cleaning up the airbox, checking connectors, and swapping the fuel filter
did not help.  Hauling it off on a 350 mile trip to my nearest factory
authorized service center cost me an outrageous bill. 
  For zero improvement
  In all fairness, it _is_ hard to fix an intermittent when it doesn't show
up on demand.  But as soon as I started treating this as an electronic
service problem, rather than an auto problem, the cause became obvious. 
  I next sent out for a shop manual, something I should have done years ago. 
The _Robert Bentley_ manuals are really outstanding. 
  Meanwhile, I decided I had to try and catch this intermittent in 
action.  While driving down the road.
  So, I hooked up an oscilloscope.  My first guess was the Hall Sensor, 
so I monitored the green wire from the sensor by using a temporary test 
pin I have shown in figure three.  The sensor output was continuous, even 
during a dropout.

Figure 3 -- A QUILTING PIN makes a safe test point along stranded wires.

               |___________/
                  
  Finally, a stroke of blind luck.  I hit the computer with my fist and the
engine died!  Something I should have thought about long before.  Something
which that mechanic _certainly_ should have tried. 
  Cleaning the connector didn't help, so I resoldered the computer.  The 
culprit was this bad solder joint on a steel lead power resistor.  Aging 
and corrosion caused the failure.  
  In hindsight, the tachometer would drop to _zero_ during failure, with 
the engine obviously still stumbling over.  Because the tach connects 
directly to the coil primary, the problem almost _had_ to be the engine 
computer or wiring.
  Interestingly, there is this newer wiring harness/filter that's 
supposed to eliminate the very same _symptom_ that is apparently caused 
by the steel lead on that big computer resistor not being solder 
wettable.  I suspect they never found the real problem at all.
  And still haven't got a clue.
  All of which did get me thinking about servicing intermittent problems 
in general.  So, figure four gives you a set of my rules that should get 
you started.  The key points are to _always _ have documentation on hand; 
to be _certain_ to get the problem to actually show up; to 
divide-and-conquer by finding out where the problem is _not_; to attack 
probably causes first; and to think logically, paying attention to _all_ 
of the symptoms.

  Figure 4.
    1.  Make certain the problem is real.
    2.  Have _all_ service manuals on hand.  Read them!
    3.  Make the problem show up.  Collect data _during_ the fault.
    4.  Divide and conquer.  Find out where the problem is _not_.
    5.  Assign probable causes. Look, smell, touch and listen.
    6.  Associate mechanical problems with connectors;  time ones with
        solder joints; temperature ones with memory chips.
    7.  Cause the patient no harm.  _Never_ hot plug!
    8.  Isolate temperature problems with fans, cold, or hot boxes.
    9   Pay attention to _all_symptoms. Be willing to change tactics.
    10. Hit it with your fist or otherwise apply _controlled_ shock.
    11. Attack the disease, not the symptom.  Things &quot;burn out&quot; for a 
        reason.  Find and fix that underlying reason.
    12. Reduce the system to the simplest possible.
    13. If all else fails, try to make the problem _worse_.
    14. When possible, compare against an identical working unit.
    15. Back off and give it a rest;  let your subconscious do the work.
    
  Yeah, there are fairly low cost data loggers out there.  But nobody has 
yet come up with a universal intermittent &quot;flight recorder&quot; that a car 
mechanic, a cardiologist, or an air conditioning repairman would fight 
over.  There's a bunch of opportunities here.
  Many thanks to real-world auto expert Bob McKnight for his superb help 
on this matter
