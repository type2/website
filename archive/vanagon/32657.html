&gt;Last night, was travelling home and saw an early model bus (sorry, I'm not
&gt;yet fluent with all of the model years) with the following bumper sticker:
&gt;I BRAKE FOR POSSUMS

these people are fanatical ultra-leftwing tree-hugging, swamp-drinking
misfits of society. encamped far beyong the fringes of everyday life, they
disparage all things commonly held in regard by the rest of humanity ... and
one of those such things is the Flattening of Possums, Whenever Possible.
now, as any civilized person with a kindergarten-level education knows, the
only &quot;good&quot; possum is a FLAT one. and how, ye may well ask, do we flatten
the little beasties?? well, the most economical way is to run over them
repeatedly with trucks and cars.  i mean, all those people in the trucks and
cars were going somewhere anyway, right? and since the possum was between
here and there, might as well run over it, right? :)

remember, in the immortal words of that late great eco-bio-politician,
Finus T. Fogbound: &quot;No possum is flat enough until you can read a book
through it!&quot;.

&gt;As I continued on my merry way, I began to ponder how Unca Joel would feel
&gt;about braking for possum, since speeding up would increase the likelihood of
&gt;a clean kill (assuming, of course, that the VW bus is the weapon of choice
&gt;for hunting such a succulent delicacy).  It would seem to me to be an ideal
&gt;weapon.  Think of it...Two tons of steel, coupled with an adequate tread
&gt;pattern, would further tenderize and flatten the flesh to allow its use in
&gt;possum rouladen, minute possum steaks, etc., etc.  The possibilities are
&gt;endless!

actually, accelerating does NOT increase the likelihood of a clean kill ...
maintaining a steady even speed does. acceleration has a tendency to &quot;pull&quot;
the vehicle to one side or the other. so remember the old mnemonic taught
you in Marine Corps Splatter School:   BRASS!
   B - Breathe. take a deep breath, then let it out slowly.
   R - Relax. steady your nerves. grip the wheel firmly, but not too tight.
   A - Aim. remember to lead the little bugger if he's moving.
   S - Steady. maintain a steady even speed. this will fool the possum into
          thinking that you are not moving.
   S - Splatter.
