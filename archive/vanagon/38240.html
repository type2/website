Subject: bad gopher archives  (bad! Bad!) 

The gopher archive searches will be unstable for a while. I'm
experimenting with some other search tools.  wais takes up a lot of space.
It's fast, but I've got over a 100Meg of indexes which doesn't make me
happy.

It should only be another week or so and I'll try to keep some kind of
search tool available.

Thanks for your patience in this.
