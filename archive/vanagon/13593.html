Subject:       Re: Ignition Wires...

Hi David.

&gt; I happened to measure the ignition wires/rotor/coil resistance of my 84
&gt; vanagon a month a go. I did get all resistance within the spec the Bentley
&gt; manual says. The van is 10+ years old.
&gt; 
Wow.  I wish I could say the same.  All my readings were so 
consistent at 3500 for the plug wires, and 1000 for the coil wire.  
Almost half of specs.  Oh well.  Maybe it's the type of driving I do 
with the van?  I drive 99% highway, hardly ever in town, and this is 
putting the ignition system under higher load... ????

Hmm.

Harry.
