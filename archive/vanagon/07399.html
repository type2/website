&gt;Thanks a lot Joel, I've believed in the existance of the man
&gt;for some 40 odd years, now you publish this scientific paper
&gt;that confirms the jolly old man is dead! I'm depressed! I'm
&gt;embarrassed....I've been had!

not so, banana-breath!! just as distant stars, long dead before the dawn of
mankind, light up the night sky, so too doth the light of Santa Claus,
Rotund Reminder of the Good in Man, brighten our seasons. :)

just cause something is 'dead' doesn't mean it ain't useful, necessary, etc.
why, just look at all the possums and armadillos on the side of the road!!!
where would thanksgiving and christmas dinner be without them?? :)
