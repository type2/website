&gt;
&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Know anyone (Karmann Konnection?) with a barndoor floor mat?
&gt;Doesn't have to be NOS, just in one piece.  We want to try to repro them.
&gt;
&gt; Also, can you give me Karmann Connection's phone number again?
&gt;I wanna call (they're the ones wil salt and pepper vinyl, right?) which
&gt;should be interesting - it will be about 3:00AM here when I do...
&gt;
&gt;Thom
Phone England code then 1702 551766, ask to speak to julian...tell him to
blame Dave for all this!
Send me your snail mail adress and I'll get some Bad Camberg Barndoor line up
pics to you? 
And I will investigate the web page if I ever get time! Any chance of some
pics of your pride and joy one day? dave.
