There was some discussion earlier as to whether or not
Red Rock SP was still the destination/camp site for the 
March 25th - 26th weekend Type II/Flannel/Crisco Fest II.
I would like to see more discussion of this as we are now
in March and we need to bottom out on this issue.  So,
where's it gonna be?
