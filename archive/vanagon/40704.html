&gt;I had this problem too.  In fact, this is the first place she went when
&gt;she finally decided to leave the litterbox.  Right down under the brake
&gt;pedal.  Fortunately, I was on the freeway at the time and didn't need
&gt;the brake.  I never found a good solution to this problem - I just was
&gt;careful to shoo her away when she was heading for that area.

        That's why I bought the leash in Arizona. I had a harness and a
6ft. leash, kept it on Tosca at all times, and kept the leash tied to the
Ebrake. Whenever he decided to be a brake pedal warmer, I just tugged him
out with the leash. I also had lots of stuff in the back, the leash kept
him out of it.

Peace,
