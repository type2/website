Subject: Mexican Watercooleds = Wasserboxers?

All this talk about Brazilian busses has got me wondering about the 
busses currently manufactured in Mexico. I know that they are a hybrid 
of styles - 70's era bus body with water-cooled rear engine and front 
mounted radiator.

What I don't know is if that engine is the same &quot;Wasserboxer&quot; engine 
found in our late model Vanagons or (in typical VW fashion) some 
completely different design altogether?

If it is the same engine, given the current state of the Peso and NAFTA 
(which probably removed any import duties that may have been in place), 
I would imagine that there are significant bargains to be had by 
shopping for big ticket parts - like engines - south of the border.

Has anyone looked into this recently?

Too bad VW never introduced the Syncro down there. It'd have been the 
perfect vehicle for the backcountry (where you see Suburbans &amp; Dodge Ram 
4x4s all over the place), and may therefore have sold in quantities 
large enough to produce a significant used &amp; aftermarket supply of 
parts.

Oh well.
