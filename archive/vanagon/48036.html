Subject: AC problem over for this year

    I give up. I just put the rad. in after cleaning out the
    cooling system, (That means the condenser was out), only to
    find that the condenser has to come back out because of a leak.
    The Ozone has got to have a hole above my house that's huge. 
    The AC in my system was bad. It still needs a AC thermostat,
    and now a condenser. I just can't spend any more time on it
    this season.  Anyone got some good ideas as to a good supplier
    of AC parts? I need them for april of 1997!
