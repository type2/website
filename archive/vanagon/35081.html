Marlin,

A couple of things catch my attention: 

1. If the engine's missing, you might have a shot tranny. There's a 
reason it didn't make it back in the bus.

2. &quot;Mostly surface rust&quot; means there's more. Is it rusted underneath?&quot; 
are there some holes? Since I'm no body worker, rust gets terminal once 
it goes deep enough. My '71 has rust underneath and a few holes near the 
wheel wells. I wouldn't buy a bus with this much rust ever again...unless 
I learn some really good welding tricks (I may take a class one of these 
days) *and* run across the really rare bus that I want to raise from the 
dead. THAT won't be a '69.

I can't say if you've found a good deal or not. If you are sure you can 
repair the rust and you have the will to stay the course, go for it. You 
might also have to rewire, replace tranny, repair/replace CV Joints, etc. 
Just as long as you know what you're jumping into.

Just some food for thought. Joe

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I just joined the list here and am about to take a plunge.  I hope posting
&gt; a message like this is kosher.
&gt; 
&gt; I am about to buy what I believe to be a '69 CamperMobile.  It seems to be
&gt; in decent shape.  The rust is primarily surface and even then very minimal.
&gt; No dents, no massives scrapes or stuff.  It has no fridge or faucet but
&gt; the other stuff seems to be there.  Has five good tires.  It is $250.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, yea, small, minor point - it has no engine!
&gt; 
&gt; I do not need this for transport right now although it is conceivable that
&gt; I might at one point or another.
&gt; 
&gt; My dream has always been to take a VW Bus (I used to own many Bugs) and
&gt; completely refurb it.  I would want to do all the work myself even if it
&gt; took awhile - or at least a major portion of it.  I have never done
&gt; ANYTHING like this before.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions for all you who are in the awareness:
&gt; 
&gt; A)  Is it a good 'deal'?
&gt; B)  Is it possible or am I setting myself up for failure?
&gt; C) Anything in particular that I should look for which would rule this
&gt; PARTICULAR bus out as far as a candidate.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.  Your answers whether public or private would be most helpful and
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; -Marlin
