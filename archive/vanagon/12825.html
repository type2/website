Subject: Lifespan, the next level??

While we have yet to see the full breakdown of data regarding Waterboxer 
lifespan, from those reports posted directly to the list so far, I'm 
finding the range of experiences - from rebuilds needed at less than 
50k, to no work whatsoever past 150k - quite fascinating.

When our initial survey is complete, the next task seems to be to try to 
isolate some of the factors that contribute to longevity or lack 
thereof.

Some factors that may be of relevance:

Manufacture date (can we get this specifically for the engine?)
Break in procedure (granted, many of us are 2nd hand owners)
Geographic location (temperate climate = longer lived?)
Oil brand (We've been over this, but not in concert with lifespan data) 
Oil filter brand
Oil change frequency
Oil filter change frequency
Operating oil level (topped off, or run down a quart before refill?)
Operating oil temp. (if known)
Operating oil pressure (if known)
# of incidents of low oil pressure
Coolant brand
Coolant change frequency
Operating coolant temp.
# of incidents of overheating
Air filter change frequency
Tune-up frequency
Mileage type (highway, city, mix)
Driving style (lugger, green zone, winder?)
Heavy use (towing, hauling)
Recall work (head gaskset replace, head retorque, etc)

I'm sure there's more, but I have to get some work done now.

Do we want to go to the next level and get all this data, or is it 
likely to be inconclusive and a waste of time?

Oh, and to add my bus to the current dataset (sorry, don't have Tim S.'s 
address):

'87, 56k miles, no internal engine work, no coolant leaks, appx. 1 quart 
of oil used every 3k miles (oops, compression data is at home, will send 
later).
