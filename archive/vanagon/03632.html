&gt; What's all the ballyhoo about?  The centerfold trick was funny, harmless, 
&gt; and did the trick.  It can hardly be accurately described as an act which 
&gt; &quot;terrorized&quot; the woman.

Well, the centerfold probably keeps the woman from parking in your parking
space, but not for the &quot;right&quot; reason.  The right reason could be &quot;because
it's our _private_ parking space, which an outsider has no business 
parking in.&quot;

Instead, she probably thinks there's a stalker after her, or a rapist/
degenerate lives near where she parked the car.  Naturally, she's not
going to go back there.  Hell, the wierdo might be hiding in the back
seat next time.

Leaving a note explaining her rude parking behavior would probably have
achieved the same result a bit more tactfully.  Hell, she drove a VW.
She deserved a _little_ bit more respect, right?
