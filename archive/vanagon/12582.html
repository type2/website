So Derek Drew says:
&gt; 
&gt; OK, here are some more VW Vans in Cyberspace from Europe. Let's hope that
&gt; the conversations in these posts are a little more weighty than some guy
&gt; wanting to borrow a VW van to move furniture.=20
&gt; 
&gt; Luckly, the first one is in english, and will probably amuse our list
&gt; members from the UK/British Isles.
&gt; 
&gt; The others are in German so it beats me as to what they are saying.=20

Wouldn't it be great if we could get some kind of automatic translater
so that we could pass messages back and forth between the groups.
