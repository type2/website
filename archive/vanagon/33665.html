Subject: Idiot factor at the SOTO meet (1994)

Yesterday I told tale of woe about a mid-desert idiot experience...
On the same trip I smell gas as we are parked at the SOTO show inside the
Deer Creek Winery. Fender to fender with megabuck buses built by people with
names like &quot;Charlie&quot; and &quot;Bif&quot;, along with nearly zero milage original
Dormobiles etc., the '57 Single decides to rust through the gas tank. It was
like having your uncontolable dog take a doo-doo in the PetSmart! Thinking
that the drip was due to the &quot;bad&quot; old style reserve bib connection, Mr.
Ellis &lt;genius at large&gt; decides that the thing to do is change the bib to a
std. spare bib. With no gas gauge, we didn't think we could make it to LA as
it was. 
Waiting until the whole entire caravan of a zillion nice buses left for
LA/Irvine, I proceeded to change the bib with a full tank of gas right there
laying in the grass with impatient folks waiting for me like a retarded kid
brother. I didn't think I had a choice and didn't think the drip was due to
the yet undetected rusting. Phew! Total gas bath, especially the upper
torso. &lt;Have you ever had gas running into your arm pit and worse without
having anyway to wash?&gt; Taking a gas bath and then riding in a stuffy
cram-packed single cab without hint one of ventilation on a hot afternoon
with my wife who was ballistic by now, with hormones changing like a piano
student's metronome, was tons-o-fun!  I felt bad for the wife. I was jonzing
bad for a cigarette (but dared not to). The same friend that did the 120
mile drill that was described in yesterdays tale stuck around to make sure
that we didn't forever become a part of Deer Creek Winery. It was a bummer
becauset we all missed the caravan which was always one of the highlights of
the weekend. I was real popular by the time we made it to the Irvine Holiday
Inn parking garage where I was able to take a major bird bath. Gee, I wonder
why I never see that friend around anymore? ;) &lt; actually , I do&gt;

Moral: Carry a spare everything, shim your belts properly, marry a very
patient woman, check the condition of your tank before you drive to Egypt
and back.
