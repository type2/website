Subject: desperately need right coolant flange

Well, I had my camper all packed and ready for a cross-country trip and
noticed that one of the small coolant hoses was pretty rotten-looking, so I
decided to replace it.  To make a long story short, when I tried to remove
the hose it broke the nipple off the plastic coolant flange on the right
head, putting my camper totally, completely out of comission until I find a
replacement.  Naturally I do this late on a Friday eveving when most
dealers are closed till Monday.

I live in St. Louis, MO and am willing to travel far and pay handsomely if
anyone has one of these, new or used.  My understanding is that VW has
replaced the plastic flange with a metal one.  One FLVWD had a late-open
parts dept and said it would take a week to get one in, making my
spring-break trip an impossibility.  Any help would be much appreciated.
