&gt;
&gt; Notice to non-waterboxer owners.  You can delete this
&gt; one, it's sorta long and doesn't apply to you.
&gt;
&gt; If you have the same Bentley
&gt; manual that I have, the diagram on pg 97.59 does show
&gt; two separate switches for the '84.  Mine, however, is
&gt; wired as shown on pg 97.66, which is supposed to be for
&gt; a '85.

Yes, after many hours poring over these diagrams in my library (ahem,
upstairs bath), I came to the same conclusion. The wiring in my '84
Vanagon is the same as that on the '85's diagram.

What it seems my DPO did was to change radiators, but install a two
prong thermo-switch, hook up the power lead, and the red/black lead
(for the slow speed circuit), then just shrug and leave the red/blue
lead (for the high speed circuit) just dangling. So the fan probably
came on, but at a slow speed, and just couldn't keep things cool
enough. The 16amp fuse at terminal #7 was also pretty corroded, so
that might have affected things as well.

So I need to get the correct three prong switch. Thanks for your help!
