Subject: Re: extra jack?


Uh, well I can't help you there, BUT since you addressed the Jack issue, 
I'd like to find a replacement Jack for my '70.  I would suppose that a 
Jack that raises a Vanagon could also raise a bus, so for those about to 
Jack, please offer advice!!

BTW the stock one is frozen solid with caked grease and crud.
