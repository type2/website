First off I want to praise Richard for that fine poem.  I can't 
believe how well it mirrors my current situation.  I don't think I 
have any poetry lurking but I can relate a story.  My SO has been 
thinking about buying a bug or a bus.  She doesn't own a car right 
now.  I have been trying to talk her into buying me a plane ticket to 
California or somewhere else similarly rust free so I can drive one 
back for her.  She thought that was pretty insane until I started 
forwarding messages to her about people doing that.  Also, a nice 
green bug has shown up on the block recently and a nice Civic has 
vanished.  She said, &quot;Surely they didn't get rid of a nice car like 
that for a bug.&quot;  I said do you want names of people I know who have 
done this?  Maybe she isn't right for a VW yet.  I am sure the 
condition of my bus has helped to convince her that they might not be 
reliable.  However, I doubt that many other '71 four bangers would run
like my bus on 3/4 of an engine.  (Did I mention I bought a 
compression tester)  :(  Maybe this could be a Friday thing.  
Maybe some nice stories about legendary reliability.  Of course, put 
&quot;Story&quot; in the subject so the curiosity challenged can delete them.
