Subject: Air Flow Meters and ECU's FS

Listees,

  I'm posting this again because the original post got caught in the list being down 
and was posted by accident as RE:

  
  I have recently gotten my hands on a few 86 and newer Air Boxes.  I got them at a
reasonable price and I too plan to pass them on to people in need for a reasonable
price:)

  AIR BOXES!

  These are NEW Bosch units, they came to me in a VW Factory Crate.  They're NOT
individually Boxed, these were from the assembly line probably at some point.  The
fact that they're in &quot;bulk&quot; so to speak leaves the fact that thru time they've been
subjected to a Small amount of moisture.  There is a small amount of crust or?  I'm
not sure what to call it.  BUT they're sealed on the end that attaches to your air
filter housing with the Factory seal.  I took all that I had and did the Pin by Pin
test with a Voltmeter.  I found Zero Bad ones. I ran a couple of them on one of my Co
Workers Vanagon and found no problems with them either.

  I'm selling these for $100.00 Plus S&amp;H.  Anyone interested in one or...  should
e-mail me and I can give more details if needed.

  ECU's

  I have Re-Built ECU's for sale too!  I'm selling these for $300.00 plus a Core fee
of $225.00.  I need the cores to keep this supply Alive! I don't want your core fee I
want your burnt up ECU.  If you don't neccessarily have a bad ECU, but want a spare we
can work out some kind of arrangement.  I open to many ideas as some of you who have
done business with me know:)

  Master Cylinders &amp; Vac Boosters!

  I have a few NEW Factory Vaccumm Booster AND Master cylinder units for sale.  I'm
selling these for $100.00 for the pair.  $100.00 is the price of a New Master, I
figure that sooner or later the Boosters will start to fail and these will be worth
something.

  A Booster WITHOUT being subjected to Brake Fluid has a very long Shelf life.  I
wanted to offer these savings to the list knowing that most Listmemebers are Bargin
people and would be able to see the savings in these items.

  I hope that this info is good news for someone in need.  I try to find these types 
of deals, then pass them on.  I know that I treat people the same way I'd want to be 
treated.  As with the parts I sell, If I wouldn't use it on my own Car/Vanagon I WON'T 
sell it to another person.  Since I work in a repair shop and install the parts I sell 
EVERYDAY, I know what fits and works and I ship back the Garbage.
