Subject: Alright, a couple of more questions.

I know I said my last message was my last one before rebuild but I thought
of some more.  When I get the engine out my '77 2.0L FI, what else should I
replace besides the engine work.
I will probably replace the:
1. Clutch-  the one in there seems fine but what the heck. What is usually
replaced in this operation?
2.  Heater cables-  They broke last winter.  Is this much of a chore?
3.  Fuel lines-  these are all real stiff and britte.  What size is needed?

Is there anything else I'm forgetting?

Thanks,
Brett

PS  I recently took a &quot;plant trip&quot; to KODAK in Rochester, NY.  We toured
there tribology (the study of wear, friction, and lubricants) lab.  Our
tour guides were &quot;experts&quot; on the subject and I had to ask if they
preferred natural motor oil or the synthetic stuff.  Both said they
would only use natural oil.  One went so far as to say he met the inventor
of (I think he said MOBIL 1) and that this guy even uses only natural oil
in his car.  I though I would relay this information to you since this
list often debates the virtues of each.
	I personally do not have an opinion on the subject.  I just use
natural oil because I'm a cheapskate.
