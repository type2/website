Ian Corner said/asked:

&gt;1) van in gear:     when turning the ignition key the van lurches forward as
&gt;                    you would expect.
&gt;2) van not in gear: when turning the ignition key the starter motor sounds
&gt;                    as if it is not engaging. Looking at the crankshaft
&gt;                    when turning the key reveals that it is not spinning.
&amp;
&gt;Any ideas as to how to continue?

Just a thought:

Maybe this is an electrical problem, not in gear: no ground, in gear: ground
and the starter gets (more) juice. On my '73 I would check the groundstrap
from transmission case to body. You could also check with a jumper cable
directly between battery negative and the starter motor housing.
