Subject: to fuel inject or not to fuel inject
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 1995 12:14:42 EST

Hey all,
	Like I've said, I'm hoping to buy a '77-'79 bus sooner or later
	and I know a lot of folks have converted their fuel injected
	engines to carburetted engines.  I, however, happen to like fuel
	injection.  What does removing the fuel injection and adding a
	stock Solex carb do to performance and fuel economy?  I would
	imagine it would impact both negatively.  Would I be likely to
	find a bus with fuel injection or have most of them been
	converted?  If I should find one that's perfect in every way
	except that it has a carburetor where fuel injection should be,
	should I buy it?  My bug had been converted and the DPO had made
	it so that it never ran like it was supposed to.  I don't want a
	repeat of that.  Last question, and I guess this is kind of
	silly, but there's not really any way of putting fuel injection
	back on is there?  I guess that the PO would have to keep all
	the old parts.  If the parts aren't there, I imagine it would be
	way too expensive to do.  Thoughts?

	Sean
