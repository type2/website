&gt; what has always fascinated me about buses is that they seem to span so many
&gt; age groups. it is almost a personality-attraction, rather than an age-group-
&gt; attraction (like, say, bmw's are today ... at least the 3-series bimmers).
&gt; it must be something about like fascination follows function.  you have to
&gt; admit: the vw bus is not the prettiest, or the most powerful, or the
&gt; 'snazziest' or really any kind of -est.  rather homely, as a matter of fact.
&gt; 
&gt; so why do so many people of such varying ages and occupations like them?
&gt; beats me. i'm just glad they made them. :)

I think for much of our generation VWs were our first car.  Then we found 
out that we could maintain them ourselves or could find someone who knew
how and learned from them.  I've seen alot of VWs out there where the father
would take car of it and the son or daughter would just drive it till they
wrecked it.  I think if the first car you owned was not a VW, then it is
not likely that you'll ever own one.  And if that same person bought one
they would soon get rid of it.  It's just a first-love afair that never 
dies.
