&gt; I have Delux 21 windows Micro bus walk thur with ragtop. The nose and doors 
&gt; are badly smashed so I would like to know is it possible to use kombi bus 
&gt; doors and nose to replace the microbus? I noticed that the dashboard of 
&gt; microbus has more features than the other bus. What year will it fit 
&gt; to replace the nose and the door for the '65 microbus? Anyone out there 
&gt; sells the nose also doors for the microbus. 

Get the nose from Das Bulli (http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/dasbulli.html) and
any door with the same handle arrangement ('64-66?)will work - you just have 
to drill holes for trim if it doesn't already have it...
