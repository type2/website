&gt; I saw one of these on the way home from BBTA.  It was in Sullivan, MO 
&gt; (also behind an import auto repair shop) and looked to be a '62 or '63.  
&gt; It was cut from jack port to jack port ... *very* short.  Would be OK for 
&gt; a parade vehicle I guess.  Sad to think that it could have been a nice 
&gt; non-sunroof deluxe :(

this must a 'common' thing to do 'cause there's a beautiful (in
a blasphemous sorta way) red and white (well, 'egg-shell') shortened
split right here in po-dunk Bemidji.  Don't know the year but it has
the glass headlight covers.  excellent bodywork and paint.  would've 
made a heck-uv-a nice 'real' van.
