&gt; &gt;Ooohh!  Thanks Joel!  I can't wait to go to the farm and try this out!
&gt; &gt;I'm gonna stick a hose in my ear and listen to the engine.  (My in-laws
&gt; &gt;think I'm a basket case anyway...)  Maybe now I can figure out where
&gt; &gt;that strange sound is coming from.

Long ago in ancient times I bought a mechanics stethoscope.  It's got a 
metal probe-like-thingy greatly resembling a long ice pick and a pair of
acoustic earphones.  You can do much better than the tube idea with a
24&quot; long screwdriver which you plant against the case and press against
your ear (the OTHER end).  You'll be astounded at the sounds.  Works well
for diagnosing those 2cyl boxers too.

Don't know if the mechsteths are available at other than $nap-on prices now.
