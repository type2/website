I have a 84 1.9L wasserboxer for sale.  This is the left-overs from a 
recent engine conversion project.  I guess you could say that I now have a 
Vanbaru.  Or would that be a Vanaru?  Anyways...I just finished installing 
a 87 Subaru OHV engine into Ye Olde Camper.  SO now I have the following to 
get rid of:

-84 1.9L wasserboxer.  Needs some new head studs.  They are all rust and 
one of them broke.   They are 14.99 at the dealer and you should replace 
all 16.  This means new head gaskets as well.  They run about $40/ea 
locally at FLAPS.  The engine was rebuilt about 25k ago (about 2 years). 
 It ran good until the studs broke.  It leaks a little oil from one of the 
pushrod tubes so it would be advisable to replace that at the same time as 
doing the studs.

- 1.8L exhaust system, complete.  Cat is only about 1yr old.  Has some 
surface rust but is not rusting out.

- Alternator

- Subaru A/C compressor.  It is adapatable to the VW installation.  Since 
the converse is true, I decided just to stay with the original compressor 
and not have to have the system discharged.

- Complete digijet system including brain and wiring harness.

- Coil

- random hoses, etc.

I would like to sell this pile outright to get it out of my garage. 
 However, I would also consider parting it out.  Make me an interesting 
offer and we'll see what we can work out.  I live in the Houston area.  If 
you are interested in the whole pile, shipping would probrably be 
cost-prohibitive but ok for parts.

You can get a hold of me here (pmeyers_at_hic_dot_net) or at 
pmeyers_at_netgate_dot_compaq_dot_com.  I only check hic_dot_net address once a week.

Additionally, if you have any questions about the conversion, I am willing 
to answer most of them.

Phil
