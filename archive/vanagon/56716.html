Subject: V-6 Conversion Mecca

Hi All,

I had the luck to meet up with a nearby VW enthusiast who has done quite a
few Bubble Window Bus V-6 Chevy/Buick conversions.  He also has an early
80's Vanagon with a V-6 Buick.  After an extensive tour and conversation,
it became apparent that he did not have anything bad to say about the
conversions.  On the Bubble Windows, he made a sideways basketballhoop-
looking thing to enclose the radiator to look like a spare tire.  Upon
reflection after 10 or so conversions he says the easiest way to go is a
H2o-equiped Vanagon. He no longer works on VWs as his eyesight is failing.
He does have a nice 79 with a V-6 and a 76 from North Carolina that fell
on it's side.  The 76's damage is not bad, but it wonders on the road.  It
would make a great donor Bus for a clean Bubble Window body.  He wants a
grand for it and the Chevy V-6 has about 23k on it.  I dunno on a price on
the 79 and I think he said it is an automatic.  He's about 35 miles south
of KC.  Lemme know if anyone would like further info.  His wife drives the
Vanagon V-6 conversion.
