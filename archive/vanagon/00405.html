Subject: Re: '83 rear shocks replacement

concerning replacing shocks,
  i'd like to add a few things that might go wrong

   1. bolts too tight, wont loosen:
       try the usual stuff, liguid wrench let it sit overnight
       heat sometimes helps but be careful. if its still no go then 
       go to a garage!

   2. sometimes they are stuck to the bolt, I dont know a good way to get them
      off but this is how i do it, just pry them off with brute force
      this will probably tear the rubber abd leave a metal sleeve stuck to
      the bolt. find the sleeve's weld or seam and separate it with
      a cold chistle then slide off.

   dont replace shocks on the side of the road!

   Bill
