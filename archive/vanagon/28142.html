&gt; I have to agree with Dan on this and I can't back him up strongly 
&gt; enough. I try my best not to deal with those companies which think that 
&gt; the male VW enthusiast is so gullible that he would think that their 
&gt; product is better because a semi-clothed woman is sitting on or near it.  
&gt; Another thought I think we should consider is how female fans of VWs feel 
&gt; when they are confronted with these images whenever they want to read one 
&gt; of the VW magazines or check out a car show.  We are all in this 
&gt; together, let's respect everyone.

I agree.  While I like women too (some of my best friends are women, but
I wouln't want my sister to marry one...)

While the ads may be fun for some to look at, I think it reflects a general
lack of thought on the vendor's part, and I would have to wonder if the
same shallow thought went into their products...
