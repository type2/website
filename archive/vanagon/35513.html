Subject: the wrong pushrods?

In rebuilding an '80 vanagon engine I replaced a chipped pushrod and
discovered, on getting the new one (with bulbous ends), that the old ones
(with more tapered ends) were for solid lifters.  I have hydraulic lifters.
My parts supplier says I do NOT have to replace the old ones if they are the
same length and the correct (new) one, which they are.  I see that
hydraulic-type pushrods cost about three times as much.  Can I really just
use the old ones?
