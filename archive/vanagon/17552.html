&gt; The Bently has for the AE motor: 50 HP _at_ 4000 (DIN) and 60 HP _at_ 4400 (SAE).  
&gt; Who is DIN?

Chris,
DIN is a german abbreviation for: Deutsche Industrie Norm, which means 
something like german industrial standard. These standards regulate 
pretty much everything over there, like paper sizes (DIN A4, for example) 
or all the metric bolts and screw dimensions. I think you can compare it 
with the National Bureau of Standards here. It also describes the 
standard procedures for measuring temperature/pressure etc for all 
sorts of applications.
