Subject: Drivability Problems

Hi to all the Vanagon readers,
	I've been reading some of the problems being discussed here and offered a
few solutions for some that I was aware of. I spent 12 years working at a
VW dealer only to move on to a new career about 5 years ago. I own a 1982
Vanagon diesel and love it. Don't like working on it any more though. Just
got done replacing the valves, the timing belt broke, I consider myself
lucky. The reason I am writing today is to tell you all about a VW service
communique that I was able to get from a friend still at the dealership. It
deals with drivability problems with water cooled Vanagons. Intermitent
missing, cutting out, stalling, etc.. I know that allot of the fixes are
quite expensive, and may not even work as well as some of the ones
mentioned on this list. I left the dealership before this document came out
so I cannot personally vouch for the repairs. I really don't like making
suggestions from information provided by other people without trying it out
for myself. I figure there may be some of you out there that would try some
of the items since there are so many reoccurring problems. (i.e. replace
ECU and air flow sensor and problem comes back) I was told that this
information is not to be let out to everybody in its original form. So I
have condensed the information from 12 pages to 5. Four pages are in Word
format and the fifth page is a test sheet in Excel format. I do not want to
flood people with unwanted or unnecessary mail, and I do not know what is
in the digests. I will happily send the information to anyone who wants it.
If enough people request it I will post the five pages. 
	Another quick note. While ordering the parts for my diesel from a supplier
that I used to deal with. I asked him if his company does any retail
business. He said yes so I asked if they stock the water cooled Vanagon
exhaust parts, they do. I've bought exhaust for my diesel from them and was
pleased with both quality and price. The company is New Brighton Imports
1-800-621-5125 ask or Bobby.
