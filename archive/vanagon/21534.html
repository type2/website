Subject: Re: BUSSES FOR SALE!!! (Eurovan Edition)

I sent this list to Avo, who was actually looking for an MV, but thought the
rest of you Eurovan seekers might want to see it too.

Haven't found any MV's but I did find four '93 Eurovans in the Saturday 22
July 1995 Minneapolis Star Tribune.  All phone numbers are area code 612.

Maplewood Toyota 482-1322:  Loaded, like new $15,995

Two at Burnsville Volkswagen 894-3500: one blue, one Sahara Met, bal of new
warranty, no prices listed.  I think the blue one is about $16,000, I think
it is the one I test drove.

One Private Seller, 781-8449:  GL, 5 spd, AC, ABS, CC, silver blue, Exc!
(sic) 31,000.  $16,300.

Burnsville Volkswagen also has four or five of the Winnie campers in the
$25,000 to $28,000 range.
