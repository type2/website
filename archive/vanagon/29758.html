  Intake manifold pre-heat tube was clogged 
with built up carbon so I decided I would clean it out.  Had an old
handbrake cable, cut it to length and put it in the hand drill.  Ran
it in turning same way as the cable twist but was not doing much.
Boy genius thinks to himself, &quot;if I turn the opposite direction, the
cable end will unwind &amp; help knock crap loose&quot;.  I proceeded to get
the cable stuck in the tube and it took me about another 45 minutes
to get it back out.  Decided to soak it overnight in engine cleaner
but didn't help (might try Liquid Plumber later).  Ended putting a
good one on it from my stash. 

Does anyone have a good trick to cleaning out those pesky clogged heat
risers?
