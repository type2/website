Subject: Re: O2 sensors, setting air mixture


Does anyone have this article? Joel? 
I put a file called ExhaustAnalyzer on the gopher archive and in the file 
archive with some information I got somewhere....

hey!
sorry it took so long, but i found out where the article is.  i lied, it's
not in EC, but in VWtrends (a debateably &quot;good&quot; source of info).  It's in
the september 1993 issue, on page 70.  If you can get your hands on it, 
itd
be best if you summarized yourself.  If you can't let meknow and i can try
reading it and doing a summary to you. (now that i've found it, it 
shouldn't
take as long :-)
again, i'm sorry i took so long, but there ya are.
DREW
ps the title of the article is &quot;mixin' it up: adjusting the fuel mixture 
on
your injected water pumper&quot;
