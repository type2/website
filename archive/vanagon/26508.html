Subject: FS '91 Westy (Phoenix, AZ)

Spotted at the dealer that I &quot;stole&quot; my '83 Westy from.


'91 VW Westfalia Camper
82,250 miles 
$19,900 asking price.
Guessing at the codes on the window I'd bet that they gave $8,800 trade in
on it.
&gt;From past experience I would float a stupidly low figure at them and stick
to it and then really watch the interest rate shoved at you in &quot;the room.&quot;

Burgandy with Silver grey interior 
Captian's chairs, both tables, rear screen, front curtains, all in great shape.
Skylight in poptop (Martha!), Power mirrors, Stock German Named AM/FM (Not
Blau-punk, Alloy Wheels, Bra, A/C, **Autotrans** =(, Excellent looking tires

No apparent water or oil leakage. Sales guy insisted on showing me how clean
the engine was. (Yeah, duh, it should be after a detail job!). I was told
that &quot;these are a rare vehicle.&quot; I asked what the bottom line was for a
serious buyer. &quot;Oh that is up to the salesman to determine with the
customer.&quot; (Salesmanager)&quot;I wouldn't want to step on a salesman's deal.&quot;
Yeah, and you certianly wouldn't want to encourage a sale either huh!?
(Salesmanager)&quot;The internet is too hard! Computers are too difficult. You
just type one colon or one back slash wrong and you have to start all over
again!&quot;
(VanBondo) &quot;Yeah, if sales of vehicles was my livelihood and there was a
technology that somewhat automatically prequalifies my target market
according to interest group, I would certainly avoid it also!&quot; &quot;Those darn
backslashes cause total greif in my life! ;)&quot; &quot;That darned old DOS was a
really hard **'programming language' to learn! *Cancel Abort Retry*    *GPF*
&quot;Have you looked at a computer anytime post 1977?&quot;

**Don't flame me I was teasing the sales guys!
