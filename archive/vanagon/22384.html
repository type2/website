Subject: Dead Reflections (f)

&gt;From the Aircldvw list David Potts  dpotts_at_vsd.clc.gmeds_dot_com mused:

&gt;No disrespect intended, however I wonder if the announcement of the Grateful
&gt;Dead's lead singer will send a rush of new (used) buses to the for sale
&gt;world.
&gt;
&gt;Or perhaps they will be even more sought after for nostaglia reasons.....


Rusty VanBondo thought:
Good point Dave,

Not to be morbid myself, I wondered what the funeral procession would look
like! Outside of reality and responsibilities I would LOVE to be there, not
to be a Deadhead hanger on, (hardly) but to check out the buses! =). 
I *almost* went to only one show. I stopped following the Dead, musically,
way back around &quot;Mars Hotel.&quot; A couple of years ago I wanted to check out
the Dead because I had never been to a Dead show and hadn't had the chance
to check them out live. Jerry's health had been somewhat shakey even at that
time. I couldn't get anyone to go to the show with me.  Everyone laughed and
basically suggested that I get a life or spend time more realistically and
volunteer time with the young republicans etc. (not). So I decided to go
solo and have fun regardless of the circumstances. Got tickets, got film and
the appropriate refreshments (within reason as a then employee of a military
aircraft manufacturer). I knew I was in trouble when traffic backed up
zillions of miles from the venue. I spent three hours in traffic, solo, in
Arizona's heat at idle in my '57 single cab with out refreshments
appropriate to operation of a motor vehicle and no tunes in the single.
Like, brutal dude! We were shuffled by every parking lot and equidistant to
the opposite side of the venue where I finally parked in an apartment
parking lot at the risk of being towed. We're talking no airflow over the
cylinders as well as in the cab of the single cab! I was SO FRUSTRATED by
the time I was able to park the bus, as well as mildly claustraphobic, that
I sold the ticket to the first freak that walked by. At that point I didn't
even want to go into the show. I had a fairly fun time in the parking lot
photographing the buses and talking to various people. I inadvertantly
scared a couple of vaugely undercover narcs. They kinda freaked when I
photographed a bus near theirs. They didn't look the part at all and told me
that they had been &quot;on the road since New Hampshire&quot; even though they didn't
know what year their buus was and said it sounded like the engine was going
but couldn't tell me if it was a rod knock, exhaust leak or a &quot;sticking mud
valve&quot; (made up test item). they had very little luggage and were just
sitting in the parking lot slumped down without any lights on, no groceries,
signs of celebration/interest. They said &quot;the old ladies&quot; got the tix that
night. Yeah, right-on crewcut man!
I realized that night that I was years beyond my &quot;party daze&quot; so I mebbe had
a couple of brewskies and the usual Marboro Lights in a box and made
donations for some UFO veggie/noodle concoction. Photographed alot of young
kids and modern buses, no killer bonified Dead buses to speak of. Cherry
VanBondo thought that I was weird as hell for calling her up and letting her
know that I sold the ticket and would be home safe and sober in time to
check out the late show. The wildest thing that I dropped that night was the
car keys. Oh gee, party on bif! ;)
