Subject: Re: Hot Water Glitch?

My hot water design isn't intended for super cold climates. Here in 
California, freeze ups wouldn't be a problem. I camp in cold areas, but 
usually I'm in the van with the heat on. 

Maybe the heat exchanger could be located higher than the tank so it 
would drain itself when the pump was off (with some special valving)
