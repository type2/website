  OFFICE MEMO          RE&gt;Appropriateness NON-VW              Date:3/15/96

Humble comment on-
&gt;I cannot purchase the vehicle
I love and desire because some dork-in-a-tie decided that my vehicle of
choice is too dirty/unsafe for me to own.
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
I think that beyond the restrictions of government there exists a higher set
of rules. The Earth is not at our disposal. Within a closed system no action
is ever done without consequence. Minimal impact on the system as we pass
through it is more important than getting upset at a government regulation
that, however poorly executed, is merely trying to enforce what you should
already be doing.
