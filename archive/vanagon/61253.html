Subject: Westy roof rack question

Does anyone have any words to the wise regarding the idea of putting 
gutter-mount roof racks (Yakima) on the pop-up top of a Westy, using bolt 
on adaptors? I'm looking at a max load of maybe 100 lbs., and usually 
much less. My usual load will be windsurfing masts, and I'd rather be 
able to open the top with them still attached. Comments, anyone?
