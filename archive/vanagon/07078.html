Hi Ric.

&gt;For you EVers who are contemplating putting fog lights on your 
EV,
&gt;I have the part number for the fog light switch...the one 
which
&gt;will fit next to your rear defrost switch, etc. Its:
&gt;
&gt;			535 941 535 01C

Do your US-spec Transporters (I'm NOT going to call them 
Eurovans. Yeccch.) have the three-way switch for the rear 
foglight?  If so, don't use them to power the fronts too, as 
the circuitry in the factory-supplied unit does not have a 
three-way (front AND rear) facility.  Power is not passed 
through the second detent on the switch, only the full-on 
setting.  I confirmed this with my local VW garage after 
spending a couple of days decoding their official service 
manual.  There is another version of the switch which does work 
correctly but, over here anyway, it is not a standard item.

My front spot lights, happily mounted on the bullbar, work 
through a second fog light switch right beside the main switch 
and only come on during full beams.  This drove the garage 
people *completely* bananas and had to be finished by myself 
...  :(

A-ha!  Even though it's 2am, I've just gone down to my Tranny 
to check the switches (the things I do for you people) and 
guess what!  *Both* my foglight and front spot switches are ... 
535 941 535!  So I'm right!  If you are powering through this 
switch, use the terminals '+' and '83a' as positive and 
negative respectively.  That will make the switch work as 
OFF-ON-ON instead of the foglight's OFF-OFF-ON.

Enjoy.  If I'm not making sense it's because I'm tired.  These 
late nights are *killing* me.  Clearer explanations may be 
available in the morning.

Shponfirkle,  (Tazmanian Bushrat word - can mean anything!)
