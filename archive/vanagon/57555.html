I was told (last June) by VWoA that the &quot;good will&quot; program ended last May
(1996), not this May (1997).  BTW, VW will fight you to the end, and the
end for me was the final word of the regional VW rep.  So, start
diplomatically sweet talking the rep, not the customer service person on
the 800 #, and get all your ducks in a row before seeing them.  One final
thing... hope that a PO didn't do something like have an engine overheat
that the VW rep knew about!!!  Of course, which came first the overheated
engine that fried the head gaskets (as they claim), or the head gaskets
that then overheated the engine.  I think we, as owners, know the answer
that question.  Oh, and hope that you don't live in a state that has an &quot;As
is...&quot; policy on buying used cars (aka - your screwed!).

&gt;They won't admit it but in 1985 or so the Federal trade Commission
&gt;mandated that VW fix the heads    thru the BBB autoline  you could get the
&gt;heads done if lucky V W paid 100%  or at least pro rated the repair based
&gt;on mileage but they did'nt advertise the program   you had to find out
&gt;about it on your own and then you had to have all your repairs done by a
&gt;dealer so that the records would be in VW kaputer
&gt;I used the program twice as my heads go every 35,000 miles BUT the program
&gt;ended in May of this year

It's only March.  Are you saying the program's on for two more months?
