As Bill pointed out this is essentially the same layout as an EV
MV (Multi Van);  two front bucket seats, two rear facing &quot;theater&quot;
style seats, a bunch of leg room, then finally the three person rear
folding bench seat.  Yes, the folding table is a nice touch.

What's nice about this arrangement, Tom, is that with the middle
theater seats folded up, you can pull the rear bench flat and sleep
two on it.  Now, it ain't gonna be no king size bed, but hey, your
friend's gonna be hard pressed to sleep comfortably in his Volvo...

Some of the other things I recall about the Carat is that it had 
pretty much power everything, A/C and, yes, my friend's
Carat also had a 4 speed stick (funny, I would have thought they'd
have put a 5 speed in there).  Oh yeah, they also come with a 
monochromatic paint scheme.

Nice bus...if you can find a '90 or '91 in good shape/reasonable
price I'd go for it.

Good luck,

Norman
