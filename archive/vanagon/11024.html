&gt;On Tue, 31 Jan 95 12:18:39 CST you said:
&gt;&gt;I was referred to you for other Type II fans.  Would like to hear what you
&gt;&gt;are about.
&gt;
&gt;well ... here's the standard Seduction Message i send out to all the folks
&gt;that i notice posting something about buses:
&gt;
&gt;i just wondered if you knew about the bus list. there are about 240
&gt;of us on the list, microbuses, buses, vanagons, and even some eurovans.
&gt;admittedly, it is biased toward the buses and vanagons (cause there
&gt;are many more of them than anything else), but occasionally the split-
&gt;windows get in their licks, too. :)  to subscribe, mail to
&gt;listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu   with one line of text:
&gt;subscribe vanagon John Jones
&gt;and to post/ask/answer, mail to    vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
&gt;
&gt;it is a bit of a talkative list, about 30-40 messages each day, and
&gt;sometimes (especially fridays), it gets a bit silly. but all in all,
&gt;we do try to help each other with problems and info.
&gt;
&gt;if you have access to ftp or gopher software, you can access the info
&gt;files and archives that way as well:
&gt;   ftp site
&gt;      lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:/pub/vanagon
&gt;   gopher site
&gt;      halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

&gt;mostly it's a sort of jabber-fest, with folks talking about this or that,
&gt;asking questions, telling about some bus they saw, some trip they took, etc.
&gt;almost a large family. ;)

Well count me in.  I am one of those splitties.  I own a 58 Deluxe hardtop I 
bought about a year ago from the original owner for $75!  It is totally 
complete except for the crank for the crank start (have the pulley nut and 
apron).  The body and frame are pretty rusty because this is Minnesota, but 
everything is there, including the bumpers with trim.  I also own a 63 Westy 
SO35(6?).  It is the one with the pull-out middle seat and front flip seat.  
Again, fortunately, it is complete minus just a couple little things.

The 63 I have taken down to just the body and it ready for media blasting 
and paint and then the trick of reassembly.  The 58 is much more a long term 
project because of all the rust.  But it only has 49,500 original miles so 
it is definitely one I want to do.

I also own a 55 Deluxe sunroof and a 64 Deluxe sunroof, but both are in much 
worse shape.  I also just sold a 62 Kombi standard.

I am originally from San Francisco, California so I used to have my fill of 
busses.  But now that I live in Southern Minnesota, it is almost a no-bus 
part of the country.
