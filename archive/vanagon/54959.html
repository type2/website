Subject: FS: 87 Syncro in Missouri

Hi All,

I have a good lead on a grey 87 Syncro in MO.  It has about 170k and has
been well maintained.  Currently it has some mainshaft brg and driveshaft
problems, but it is still drivable.  4k was the asking price until the
drivetrain problems surfaced.  Body &amp; interior and very good.  Head
gaskets at 138k, new muffler, slave cylinder and rf CV.  No alloys.
email me for further info.
