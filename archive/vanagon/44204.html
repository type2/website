Thanks to everyone who replied with their 2 plus cents worth. It helped me
put things into perspective, somewhat. Just tofill you in on what happened:

I decided to offer $4500 and he came back with $4700. I said I'd let  him
know the next day. After careful consideration, I decided I had to hold off
for a while and I told the owner to not rule me out but I needed some time.
Then the day after that I came up with a source of funds and after more
careful consideration (with the help of advice from the list and a few other
very nice people, John Winkley from Vintage II and the &quot;Bus guy&quot; from ASK in
Houston), I decided to go with it. Unfortunately at that point the owner
decided $4700 was a &quot;blue light special/24 hour only&quot; offer and wouldn't let
it go for a penny less than $5000. 

At that point I just felt the &quot;karma&quot; in the deal just wasn't right and I
suddenly didn't feel bad about letting it go. The problem now is that I
don't have a camper. If any one knows of any nice late '60 or early '70
campers in or around Texas that are for sale, please contact me. I would
like to pay less than $4000 and really need it by the end of July.

Thanks again, Martin
