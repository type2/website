 Subject: FS: VW bra/mask for  VW Vanagon

  For sale: Black, Bra/Mask for VW Vanagon one piece $100
  It has Vanagon embrodered on the top section.  Protects and keeps bugs
  out of the radiator with a nice sheer built in screen.
  I had this on my '91 Vanagon, not sure what years it will fit, I imagine
  that it should fit any Vanagon with square lights.  Used for less than
  one summer.
  I will pay the shipping on this if you are interested.
