I understand the problems.  I don't belive there is a real far north 
alternative destination for those on the east coast of the continent, but 
I could be wrong (as usual!).  I don't know of any roads to take you even 
as far north as the southern part of Hudson's Bay through Ontario or 
Quebec.  (Eastern canadians: correct me?)  How about Newfoundland?  
Always wanted to go there, supposed to be very pretty, and it's even 
cold!  Someday, I'll get there.

Another east coast destination suggestion: Eastern Quebec out to the end 
of Hwy 138 on the north side of the St. Lawrence River, perhaps with a 
trip to Ile D'Anticosti?  Or to the Gaspe Penninsula?  Or to Cape Breton, 
NS?  I think PEI would be pretty zooey in the summer.  Other ideas?

As per suggestion 2: two weeks is a bit short for a coast to coast and 
back run, IMHO.  Especially at the slower speeds I (and other bus 
drivers, I hear :-)  ) usually drive.  And ESPECIALLY considering that 
the really interesting stuff is off the interstates and travel is much 
slower on average on the secondary roads.
