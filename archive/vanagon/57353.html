Subject: pinnacles food


Volks - we really need 75% of you to still sign up for what food
you plan to bring to Pinnacles.  I don't want to get too obsessive/
compulsive, but with that many of you still not responding, I want
to make sure we don't end up with 14 dessert dishes.  Please let
me know  ASAP.  It's usually easiest to bring the same type of
dish for both nights or the breakfast.

Looking forward to hearing from most of you!
