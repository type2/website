&gt; A couple of years ago, I had a similar problem with the driver's side door
&gt; on my '79 Bus.  I really had to turn the key hard to get it to pop up the
&gt; lock button.  Sometimes I would have to turn it clockwise and then
&gt; counter-clockwise until it popped up.  The problem got worse and worse.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, I carefully popped the inside door paneling snap things out of
&gt; their holes, one by one, and removed the window crank, inside door handle
&gt; hardware, etc.  I really couldn't get to the guts of the lock mechanism
&gt; easily, so, out of frustration, I just plugged the little red hose into the
&gt; WD-40 nozzle and sprayed all up inside there, under the door lock pop-up button
&gt; 
&gt; It worked!  The lock popped up and down like the day it rolled off the
&gt; showroom floor.  I then inserted the red hose into each keyhole on the Bus
&gt; and sprayed, following that with a good dose of powdered graphite lock
&gt; lubricant.  No lock problems since.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheese

You've got to understand that the '71 lock is different from the later
years. Our discussion about the broken or missing return spring for the
lock lever still stands. While we do feel that lubrication is important,
it won't help a broken spring.
