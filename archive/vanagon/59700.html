Subject: manuals


Pardon my use of bandwidth.
Kedar (Imckewa_at_lmc.ericsson.se?), I've been trying to respond to your 
request for manuals, but the mail I send to your address keeps bouncing 
back.  I wanted to give you instructions for sending me a SASE for your 
copies.  Send me an email if still interested.
If anyone else has requested manuals and has not heard from me, email me 
again.  
Again, I can copy my Dometic fridge, Dometic service centers, Westy stove 
and SCS radio manuals if anyone wants them, I'll have you send me a SASE.
Gerald, thanks for running a great list.
I would gladly contribute to keep it going.
Charles
