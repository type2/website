&gt; How hard was replacing the pressure relief spring and where do you
&gt; access it?

Well, it's not hard on the '87.  You just remove the cover using a
big washer on a vice grip and the rest of the junk all falls out.
Now I hope I put it back in right because it just kinda plunked out,
so I have no idea which way the piston goes.  Also, I didn't see a
ball of any kind.  Is there supposed to be one?

Anyway, I put it in like this:

I sealed up the leak in the oil sender tube with teflon tape, but
only on part of it so it would still ground.

The problem now is that I'm still getting what sounds like lifter
noise, which scares me.  I should also mention that I did use the
engine flush stuff like Brad Snyder.  I'm hoping I didn't lodge
some piece of crud somewhere.  I still have 10W30 in the case and am
wondering if 20W50 will make the noise go away.  I'm gonna poke
around the archives before I continue, but if anyone has any advice,
please p-mail me since I'm in digest mode.
