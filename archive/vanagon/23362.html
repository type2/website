Subject: Stafford's updated directions/Wailaki


Here's what I've deciphered from Jack Stafford's message on my
tape machine.  I had already posted directions to the Wailaki
campground a week or two ago, and they are the same - Jack's are
more detailed.

NOTE:  he warns to bring bug spray/insect repellent.  He also
says they have &quot;elevated&quot; fire rings, so that we won't have to
bend over to burn our magnesium  :)

Take 101 to Garberville, then go in the direction of Briceland
and Shelter Cove.  You want to go to the King's Range National
Conservation Area, and from 101, will be going west approximately
22 miles.

Go left on Chemise Mt. Road, then go 2 miles.  He says it's very
&quot;dark&quot; back in here, and that you may have to be on some non-paved
area, and stay in second gear.  

Pass Nadelos campground.  Wailaki is on the right.

Jack says there are hardly any signs, so watch carefully.  He says
it's a nice newish facility.  I believe there are pit toilets, but
not showers (you may remember I'm bringing my new one to try out),
and no electricity.  

I'm not sure about water availability, so best to truck it in, filling
up in say Garberville.  On that note, I recommend putting gas in
the tank there as well.

BRING FIREWOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bring also:
water
bug spray
food
more firewood
folding chairs
beer/whatever

We're planning to go from my house here in Moraga Friday morning, 
leaving at 10 a.m.  Bradley has some CBs to loan, I believe,
and at least Jeff Schneiter is meeting us here.  Anyone else welcome
to join, too, of course.

See you there!
