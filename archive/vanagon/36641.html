Subject: Re: More Mexican Busses

&gt;
&gt;What is it about the new VW's that cannot be imported in to the US?
&gt;Not the emmissions. It's appearently the safety requirements are not
&gt;being met.  I'm wondering if one could call a dealership, or VW Mex. and
&gt;have a long block, including the FI &quot;brain&quot; shipped here to the US?
&gt;The remainder could be fabricated/procured for a minimum of
&gt;$$$(relative).  What do ya'll think?

        Why not buy a bus in Mex., drive it home, and put all the parts on
an old US breadloaf. Then you have a legal VIN. The question is: How close
is the Mex. H2O chassis to the older US breadloaf? If VWMex added/changed
the engine mounts, you get the picture...

Peace,
