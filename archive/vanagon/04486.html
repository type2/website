&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Definately!  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Well, remember that the Vanagon is 5-6 inches wider inside than the older 
&gt; bus, it also has a rear deck height about 6&quot; lower. It would be a major 
&gt; kludge, since you'd have to narrow the cabinets/bed, and cut off the rear 
&gt; section of the bed base, loosing your hinge mechanism. I don't know about 
&gt; lengthwise mods, but you will need a full (vanagon size) side behind the 
&gt; driver. I've gone the other way, '72 westy into '85 vanagon, lots of spare 
&gt; room, and the '72 westy guts are more modular units.

Yeah, I suppose it would be quite a bit of work.  I was mainly thinking
about the sink/stove/fridge unit - that would be an easy bolt in.

&gt;         The comment about the heads is right I believe, but why not use the 
&gt; whole damned thing, as long as the flywheel and engine mounts work out. 1000 
&gt; mile rebuild would be just broken in, and probably less work adapting 2000 
&gt; motor intact than making a hybrid.

The main reason is that it would look like the stock motor, and could be
smogged easily, even here in Calif.  Fuel injection would be nice, but
it would be totally illegal.  And I don't know if the Vanagon exhaust
would fit on the '74.  It would sure run clean with the catalytic (sp?)
converter!  The smog control morons should allow this, dammit!!!  But no...
having the newer, cleaner burning engine in a '74 would be classified as
&quot;modified emissions equipment&quot; and would probably get a person fined.
*sheesh*
