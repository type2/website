Subject: Cushy question

        Im about to wash all the curtains and the cover for theback mattress
and am wondering if there are any precautions I should take. I havent yet
been able to get the cover for the back cushion off yet since its on there
so tight, and the foam 'grips' the material. Im fearful of busting the
zipper, so I guess I just have to take it slow and easy.
        Its amazing how you can actually hear the engine when that cushion
out of the back. Its creates quite the sound insulator.

        The van all sparkling clean inside now.....except I do still have to
attempt to pull the fridge and sink unit out to clean behind it. Im more
curious to see whats behind there than anything.
