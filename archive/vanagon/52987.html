Actually, PIAA style lights have that blue tint as well, however I don't
know if there are any for the EV or Vanagon.  I'm working on an early H4
set for my Type IIs and adapting them for the PIAA bulb.

&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Over the weekend I was driving along and saw a new mercades coming up
&gt; behind me with very well focused headlights that had a blue hue to
&gt; them.  They were really bright.  
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen them or know about them?  Could I get them or something
&gt; like 'em for my 86GL?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I saw 6 Vanagons around Philly and South Jersey this weekend, one
&gt; of which I rode along side of on RT 295 for about a mile and couldn't
&gt; even get a smile out of the woman driving it, maybe she thought I wanted
&gt; more than to just say Hi.
