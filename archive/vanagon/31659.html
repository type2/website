This is probably going to be one of my last posts until the end
of January 96...but we are off to France, etc., tomorrow afternoon,
and we are looking forward to the 1996 International Vanagon Meeting
in Brussels on 1/1/96! Report to follow later...

Last time we went over (1/94) we got a VIP tour to VW in Wolfsburg...
this time the same person who arranged with VW has done the same
with Porsche and Ferrari....  8)

Tomorrow night, we will be driving a European T4 with a 2.0l
engine...it will be interesting, considering we are taking our
EV-T4 to the airport tomorrow!

Any who, I look forward to getting back on the list...and am not
looking forward to &quot;list-withdrawal&quot; for the next month! If anyone
has a &quot;free&quot; company phone...we can be reached in Grenoble at
33 76 88 81 68.


Have fun, save the nasty posts about me until I get back!  :-)

Happy New Year!

Ric
