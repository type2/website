Subject: Gas heater mechanic.

I just got a new muffler put on the car and while i was waiting i 
read a 'Shop Profile' article in the Motor Service magazine.  It mentioned 
in passing the owner was VWOA factory trained in gas heater repair and 
has experience with air-cooled VWs.

the Specs.:
Bob Anderson, Owner.
GT Shop, Inc.
Watertown, MA

also mentioned his interests include computers, antique electronics, 
and chemistry.  bet he has email ability from somewhere!
