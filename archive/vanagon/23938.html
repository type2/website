Your servo may not be to blame.  I had to replace the vacuum line from the 
engine to the servo in my '73 because of cracks under the braided cloth 
covering.  Just used the cheap stuff (not the special internally ribbed stuff 
and it worked fine).  Since you had brake boost before taking it apart it 
is likely that the servo is OK.  The master cylinder is gone though since 
once it leaks from the shaft end it fills the servo with brake fluid that 
absorbs water from the engine and then corrodes the living snot out of the 
exposed aluminum of the shaft and sleeve on the master cylinder.  I suggest 
getting some vacuum hose and getting under the van to take off the vacuum 
line at the servo (watch out for puking brake fluid!) and then apply vacuum 
via the new hose directly to the servo (old master cylinder still in place). 
If you can't suck air through it then it was the vacuum line and the servo 
is probably OK once you pour all of the brake fluid out and rinse it out 
with some rubbing alcohol (washes out the brake fluid and evaporates 
instantly in engine vacuum and doesn't eat rubber parts)  Don't use gas or 
petroleum solvents on the servo since it will swell and kill the rubber parts 
inside).

Good luck
