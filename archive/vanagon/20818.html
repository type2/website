&gt;&gt;Isn't it also true that the '69's have rear defogger wires?  That was
&gt;&gt;always a Q&amp;D way to differentiate w/o measuring cables, etc.

&gt;Mine does.  Not that there is continuity or anything through the wires.

&gt;;-)

&gt;I checked the wipers as suggested by BusBoys.  Yup, they had the locknut,
&gt;but...they were silver like the 68s, not black.

&gt;I think all these posts show that VW had a continuous product improvement
&gt;program, transitioning one model year into the next over a period of
&gt;time, rather than by discrete jumps (except for the major style changes).
&gt;It seems like the safest way to tell the year is the VIN.

Mine has the rear de-fogger and it even seems to work.  The windshield 
wiper nuts are silver and non locking variety.
