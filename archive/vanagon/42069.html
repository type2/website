&gt; I have the opportunity to purchase an '86 Vanagon Synchro.I finally crawled
&gt; out of my beer after missing out on a MINT diesel westy 'bout a month
&gt; ago.It has a
&gt; factory reman. engine w/ 10k and 120k on the chassis.A few minor dents and
&gt; no rust for $3500. The current owner has owned it for 3 yrs. w/ no
&gt; problems.Also,
&gt; he's quite sure it has locking diffs.It's hard for me to figure out the
&gt; value of this. I enlist the opinion of you synchro people out there.PLEASE
&gt; !! Does it seem worth it? Any replies or info would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks in advance.  RINALDO

	If you don't buy it I will.  I could use an inexpensive parts car.  From what 
I've seen and heard:  it seems to be a great deal.
