This is what Caron calls herself because she carries a pack with everything she 
could ever possibly need when she goes anywhere.  When we first met I thought this 
was a little humorous but after a couple times where I asked questions like:

&quot;You wouldn't have dental floss in there would you?&quot;
&quot;Got any hand cream?&quot;
&quot;Boy am I thirsty!&quot;
&quot;Man would I kill for a 50lb sledge hammer right about now...&quot;

I think that turtles are one of my favorite species.
