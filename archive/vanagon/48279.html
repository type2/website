This explains those signs I've seen at the truck stop diesel islands
in recent years: &quot;50 gal minimum&quot; and &quot;no autos&quot;. In the early 1980's
I had a Rabbit Diesel, bought by mistake. Honest, I didn't realize it
was a diesel until I was signing the papers. Being from Europe, where
all trucks run on diesel, and if a gas station has two pumps, one is
diesel, I learned the hard way how different it is in California
and surrounding states. When I lost faith in the Rabbit after it popped
a headgasket, I was happy to get a gasoline-drinking 85 Golf, which I
still drive. It is practically maintenance free. (Unlike my wife's
87 Westy, which is the reason I read this list).
