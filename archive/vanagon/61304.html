I doubt that a drill or heat will work.  I had this problem with an engine
out of the van and I was completely unable to remove the broken bolt with
normal tools.  I even broke off the (not so)easy-out inside the broken bolt.
 I took the whole engine to a machine shop that specializes in removing
broken bolts/taps/easy-outs and they used a laser to remove the remains of
the bolt and easy-out and installed a stainless steel &quot;insert&quot; with new
threads the same size as the original.

My advice is to call around and find a shop with this kind of tool and
experience and pay them to do it.  I wish I could get back all the
frustrating hours I spent on this myself.  Removing/installing the whole
engine might be easier for you than doing the same on a head if you're
talking about a Vanagon waterboxer engine.

Good luck,
