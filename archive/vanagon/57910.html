Subject: Re: A/C freon R-134A upgrade...

Before the Ozone flame war erupts, let me just say that freon is only harmful
if released into the atmosphere.  Since a leaky system will not cool a bus &amp;
the price of freon is outrageous, even those who do not eat sleep &amp; breath
environmental concienciousness have an interest in keeping freon out of the
atmosphere.  
 Just a preemptive strike on the waste of bandwidth sure to take place.
Sorry,  I'm still flinching from the emmisions thread on the type two list.
