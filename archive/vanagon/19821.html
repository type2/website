&gt;My '87 Vanagon has blown 5, yes 5 different coolant hoses since last Labor

were they all the same hoses?? or each time a different one? it might be
related to a radiator that's getting more and more clogged over time. or
just age on the hoses.

&gt;need to be replaced. Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and replace
&gt;the rest (might have to get a 2nd mortgage on the house)? Are you guys

my 88 hasn't done this ... yet. :(  any other 87's or older losing hoses?
