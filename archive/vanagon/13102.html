I redid my westy with (not flannel but) upholstery grade velour.  Initially
I used 3M brand &quot;77&quot; spray adhesive, which looked great for awhile, but
then began to droop.  I patched things with their stronger grade, which
is called I think &quot;90&quot; and is made for bonding formica to counter tops.
It works so well, I'm worried that it may be a problem when removal/
redo time comes along.  One advantage, however, is that it has a 
&quot;width-controllable&quot; spray nozzle, making it nice to use inside in small
places.  You'll need a solvent for mistakes or overspray, and I think 
3M makes one, but I found that cleaning fluid (energine) worked fine.
