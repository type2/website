Subject: Re: preventing theft

Well, mine is fairly simple.

Don't (ever?:) get around to wiring up the starter relay for the bus, 
(long, old wire=high resistance, therefor usually no start...:), instead 
have wire i just plop on hte hot terminal, and she cranks right over...:)

Only about 1 in 10 times does the key work anymore...:)

(of course, they'd prolly juust grab my Blau's laying in hte floor and 
run..:(

....david (who's typoing against the lag again...)
