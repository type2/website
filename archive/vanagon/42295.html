In a message dated 96-05-16 19:35:29 EDT, you write:

&gt;What's this about a ring gear? What does it take to make it run backwards?

Ken,

By Detroit standards, the Corvair engine is 'properly oriented' in that
standing in front of the car the flywheel is rotating in a clockwise
direction.  Unfortunately, the engine happens to be BEHIND the flywheel.  If
you were standing behind a Corvair looking at the crankshaft pulley, it would
rotate in an anti-clockwise direction.

The VW engine rotates clockwise when viewed from the rear.  The mainshaft of
the transmission rotates in a clockwise direction.  This rotation is imparted
to the gear clusters on the mainshaft but the rotation is reversed by the
gearing on the pinion shaft, which engages the ring-gear to turn the axles
and cause the vehicle to move forward, etc.

If you simply bolt a Corvair engine to a VW transmission you'll end up with
four speeds in reverse and one forward gear!

But it isn't that difficult to fix.  If you dismantle the transmission and
reverse the ring gear, the Corvair will work normally, although you'll have
to change your starter.  Or you can obtain a special cam for the Corvair
engine which will allow it to 'run backwards.  Or you can replace the entire
VW powertrain with a Corvair powertrain and gain the benefit of the stronger
gearing.
