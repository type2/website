&gt;         Hello...I'm a 15 year old who is interested in VWs.  What I am
&gt; planning on doing is buying a car in bad shape and then fix it up.  Of
&gt; course, I'd like to get it done before I turn 16 because that is when I
&gt; will recieve my full license (write now I have my Restricted License).
&gt; I've been doing a LOT of research into VW busses and bugs, but I prefer
&gt; the bus.  I do have one problem....I am assuming from what I have read
&gt; that there are different kinds of VW busses.  Which would you suggest to
&gt; be the best for me?  I heard that there was one (I believe it was called the camper) that came with a refrigerator, but I'm not sure.  So, if
&gt; anyone could fill me in on the different kinds that I might be
&gt; interested in, PLEASE DO...8)
&gt; 
&gt;         One last question, how much money should I expect to plunk into
&gt; this car?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks In Advance...

What I would do is go out to some BUG FESTS where you can see many
restored busses of all vintages. Talk to the owners and find what's
right for you. Everyone is proud of their projects and always helpful to
anyone interested. Unfortunately it's a little late in the season for
such FESTS; probably you'll have to wait 'til spring. Check out the
Limbo web page for event dates for late model vans.

I did the same thing when I was your age only my project was a 1950
Vauxhall Velox 6 cylinder with suicide front doors.
