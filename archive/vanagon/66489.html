Subject:      Looking for a Vanagon Diesel

I am looking for a 82/83 Vanagon Diesel within a 300 mile radius of New
York City.
I want to build up 1 van out of the one I have got and another one I am
looking for. I need the suspension, gearbox, fuel tank and a few other
parts so the condition of the van is not important to me. I have just
completed a Alaska to Argentina trip in my '83 diesel van (not turbo)
and it requires some attention. I want to rebuild my van but at the
price of new parts I think it will be better to try and find an old car
with a bad motor to take parts from. (I put a new motor in mine before I
went travelling).

Do you know of a network of Vanagon users that I could post this to?
