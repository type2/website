&gt;Can anyone recommend a good replacement speaker for the front and back
&gt;factory installed Blaupunkt stereo speakers? I recently installed a new
&gt;Clarion tape deck, but the sound is very tinny, I think because of the
&gt;speakers. Also, the front speakers need to be flush mounted because of
&gt;the window crank being so close, so that limits your options.

I know nothing about speakers, but I am contemplating adding a
non-directional sub to improve the bass response. Do you think something
like that would solve *your* problem?
