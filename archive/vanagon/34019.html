Subject: Type VI (Aircooled) Tin Removal
Date: Mon, 29 Jan 96 13:16:00 PST


Greetings all,

I have decided to really complicate my life and challenge myself 
mechanically.  I am in the process of dropping my engine to fix/replace a 
fouled cylinder (Bad ring suspected).  I have done all the mechanical and 
electrical disconnection and am about to drop the muffler/heater boxes and 
engine.  Here is my question: I have not removed the rear tin in the engine 
compartment.  During my first attempt it seems as though the edges of the 
tin that contact the engine block have been sealed to it with some sort of 
black RTV or something.  Is this a concoction on the PO mechanic or a normal 
thing?  Can I just peel these off after removing the screws that hold the 
tin on?  Do people seal the tin to the engine (that seems weird)?

Trying my best not to mess anything else up.

Bill
