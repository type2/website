 &gt; 
&gt; I just called BBB at 1-800-955-5100. It brought me to a local BBB in Oakland
&gt; California. This call resulted in much more positive outcome regarding the
&gt; vanagon gasket problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Talked to a lady. Apparently the vanagon problem is well known subject that
&gt; the lady immediately understands what I was going to ask. She is going to
&gt; send me a mediation/arbitration forms, together with informations regarding
&gt; the FTC's settlement with VWoA and instructions, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; But I do need to provide an estimate of how much it will cost me to repair
&gt; the leaking head gasket problem. This is hard for me because the engine has
&gt; to be torn apart to determine what needs to be done and the cost of the repair.
&gt; If I go to a VW dealer I am wondering if they will examine the engine fairly.
&gt; Or if they will just say labor + cost of gasket, even if the heads are warpped
&gt; or cracked or need work anyhow. If I go to an independent VW shop I am wondering
&gt; if their estimate will be right. They might under estimate the cost by lowering
&gt; the price in order to win a business from me.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you folks think? How do I get an estimate that will give me best
&gt; protection? Dealer? Or else where? How? I think dealer will tear the engine
&gt; in order to estimate. But then they could say anything against me.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas/experience? Please help. Thanks.
