Subject: RE: Rebuild

Brett, I'm copying your note to the vanagon list because, though I'm 
anxious to help however I can, I'm still pretty much of a novice. I'm 
hoping other list members will correct any mis-statements or bad 
judgement on my part. (I don't believe Brett subscribes, so please copy 
your replies to him.)

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I'm the guy with the '77 westy that may need a rebuild.  A compression test
&gt; initially showed the compression of the 3 and 4th cylinders to be 0 and 50,
&gt; respectively.  After, a valve adjustment the compression jumped to 50 and 110.
&gt; This was in August and the points and plugs and rotor and distributor cap were
&gt; all recently replaced.  Does this give any more of an indication of a needed 
&gt; engine rebuild, especially around the #3 cylinder.  

Well, at the very least, it's probably indicative of a problem with your #3 
exhaust valve. I don't remember your other (#1 &amp; #2) cylinder readings, 
but I believe they were around 110, right? You might get lucky and only 
need head work, though it's sometimes a foolish economy to stop there.

&gt; Finally, how much should I
&gt; expect to pay for 4 cylinders, pistons and rings 

If you have to buy cylinders, etc., it will depend on the size of your 
pistons (or the size you're installing). JC Whipme (actually Whitney) 
sells 85.5 mm sets for $84.95 and 90.5 sets for $149.95. If your engine's 
stock, I'll bet (but don't count on this) that you use the latter. You 
may use even bigger. I'm not sure.

&gt; and any head performed at a
&gt; machine shop.  A rough price estimate will be appreciated.

Somewhere between $40 and $250. Rough enough? Really, I don't know. 
Different shops charge different rates. My local VW guy quoted me $125 to 
do mine. When they were done he tried to charge me $190. We settled on 
about $140. I didn't want to slap him in the face, but he *did* quote me 
a price up front. Turned out they did something wrong and I had to pull 
my motor and return one of the heads for repair. He fixed it fast and 
with a smile; no hassles. I believe you can buy *new* heads for around 
$150 each, though new heads may give you no better service than good 
condition heads with new or good valves.

&gt; Thanks, Brett
&gt; Thats &quot;head work&quot; a few sentences back.
&gt; 

I'm glad you clarified that. I'll save the wisecracks for other list 
members. Hope they'll be restrained enough not to get the boot. 8) Joe
