Subject: Re: Sway bar links breaking.


Sorry, I'm a bit slow on the draw here.  Just now getting caught up with
my e-mail.

Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who has problems with his (anti-)sway
bar linkages.  The bolt on my right hand one snapped about a year ago.  Rather
than spend the $70 some that VW wanted to replace it, I did the following:
I drilled and tapped the shaft where the threaded extension had snapped off,
and put in a good strong bolt.  Graphically:

             \  ~  /                        |   |
              |   |                         |   |
              |   |                         |   |
              |   |                         \   \
              \   \                          \   \
               \   \                          |z=z|
                |   |                         |z=z|  &lt;-- Drilled and tapped
                +---+                         +z=z+
                 z=z   &lt;-- snapped here        z=z   
   Threaded--&gt;   z=z                           z=z
 protrusion     Nz=zN  &lt;-- Nut                Bz=zB  &lt;-- Bolt head


About a month later, the other side snapped too, so I did the same thing
to it too.  So far things have held together.  It sure feels a lot better
on those tight off ramps on I70.
