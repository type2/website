Subject: Re: oil filter wrench


For an oil filter wrench try the following:

You can buy a thing that looks like a rather shallow cup. The inside is
cast (aluminum) to fit the outside of the filter and the bottom has a hex
to fit a wrench. Take a new filter to your FLAPS and tell them what you
want. It works well although you do have to push it on and hold while
getting it started.

 ||            || &lt;- Filter fits in the opening
 ||____________||
       |_| &lt;-Hex 19mm or so.
