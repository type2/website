&gt; 
&gt; Have you thought of a catalytic type heater??
&gt; 
    I've used a portable Coleman catalytic heater in my 
bus in a pinch, that burns white gas, but no flame. They can 
give off a lot of heat but you need to be careful where you 
put it so as not to melt the upholstry. I also wouldn't want 
to be in an accident when it gets thrown around inside the 
vehicle.
