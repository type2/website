Subject: 1980 Camper models question??

Hi all you Westy owners,
I'm working on a model by model description for 1980 Vanagons that were sold
in the USA market.  The brochure describes the basic P22 Camper model with an
icebox and seating for 5 and the more deluxe P27 Camper that had a
refrigerator and stove.  It also describes L models and non L models.

I'm wondering if all the P27s were L models and the P22s the non-Ls?

Does anyone have a 1980 Vanagon L Camper without the refer &amp; stove?

Does anyone have a 1980 Vanagon Camper with the refer &amp; stove?

Searching for the light,
