Bob -
Don't know that one, but Red Line Oil is online at:
http://www.redlineoil_dot_com/


They sell direct, provide distributor info, very helpful.

After probing the depths of the archives for about an hour, I give up...
Does anyone know approximatly when the Red Line gear oil discussion took
place? Or... if you have first hand knowledge and/or know about it's
properties, I'd be mighty greatfull. After rebuilding the Westy tranny
and
adding a locking differential, I'm interested in giving it something
good
to drink... Thanks,
