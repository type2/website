Today I finally got the new rims painted!  And used the last of my white
paint :( 

Now I'm gonna let them dry for a week and them get new tires!  I'm gonna
go out tonite and try to find a Hemmings so I can find Coker's
address/number and order some Porta Walls!

BTW - can these be put on after the tires are put on?  Like break the bead
and slip the in?
