If you don't mind a really boring drive, I noticed a yellow 60ish Karman
Ghia convertible on a used car lot. The paint looks new, but I haven't asked
about the price they want for it. Of course, this would means you'd have to
drive to Saskatoon. You should be able to find a few in Calgary. I did see
some in Lethbridge when I was there a few months ago - check out Letbridge
Auto Haus (the VW dealership) as they always have some aircooled VW's on
their lot.
