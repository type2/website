Subject: leaky AC compressor

My AC compressor (Sanden 508) leaks between the main body of the
compressor and the end plate next to the pulley.  Does anyone know if this
where refrigerant finally works its way out after getting by the shaft
seal?  I know this sounds like a stupid question since the obvious place
for the shaft seal to leak is next to the shaft but this is where the
bubbles are.  The VW parts film shows a set of gaskets for the valve body
and end plate on the other (i.e. the hose end) of the compressor but there
are no gaskets (except for the shaft seal kit) for the pulley end of the
compressor even though there is a thin end plate on that end.    If anyone
has had any experience with a leaky shaft seal and has seen bubbles behind
this end plate, let me know.

By the way, this compressor (Sanden 508 with rear exit hoses for R-12, cat
# 04508-VRA) is listed in the Vintage Air (San Antonio, Texas
1-800-862-6658) catalog for $199 (new).

If anyone has any information about this leak, let me know.  I need to
decide if I can fix this with a shaft seal kit or if more involved repair
is needed.
Thanks,
