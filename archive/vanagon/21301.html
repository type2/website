Subject:       vacuum hose source

don't forget fleet/farm supply stores have LOTS of vacuum hose for 
milking systems.  it's usually clear but very thick wall to stand up 
to close to 30&quot; vacuum.  substantially cheaper than auto sources.

please don't use heater hose.  i shudder to think i'm meeting people 
on the road with soft, collapsable heater hose supplying vacuum to 
their brake systems.  as i've said before, &quot;don't f*ck around with 
brakes.&quot;  end of sermon.
