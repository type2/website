So Bob R. Kenyon says:
&gt; &gt;Smog is a non-issue for that old of a bus Bill.  Even if it was, a newer
&gt; &gt;engine would be acceptable.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems to me when I got my '59 registered, they are requiring smog checks
&gt; for foreign cars back to '64. But I don't know what they check.

Doh!  I think that I was thinking that Bill's pick-up was pre-60's.  Of
course I could've looked at the subject line [duh].....

Thanks Bob,

Steven
