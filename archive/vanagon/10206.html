&gt; OK so if the fluid isn't leaking out the front master and the car hasn't
&gt; moved since the last top-up, the only other way it could leak out is through
&gt; the
&gt; force of gravity. So my next job is to find the &quot;lowest point&quot; in the van
&gt; and that's where the fluid will be. Not.

Did you look underneath the van and the chassis?  When our clutch master 
cylinder leaked it was so bad that it left a puddle small puddle on the
ground plus all over on the carpet.  There was some fluid in the spare tire
carrier also.
