Jeez Joel,
this wasn't modelled on my family, was it?  Names will be withheld to
protect the guilty, but I can think of several family members who fit
the bill (that is, A, B, *and* C).
Pretty funny, actually...it brightened up what looks like the start
of a pretty sh*tty week.  And it's only Monday morning.
Joachim
