&gt; Is this normal for this kind of fridge? It took me the whole night to
&gt; cool up the fridge and one soda pop spoiled the fridge's purpose. Are
&gt; these fridges made to be opened ONLY once a day... when the van is
&gt; at a stop? How do you guys use this fridge? Is it better then to buy
&gt; one of those Igloo coolers that plug into the lighter socket?

Sorry, but the fridges just aren't that strong, especially in hot weather.
There are some things you can do though.  Derek Drew wrote up an article
some time ago about improvments that can be made, such as installing a
small fan inside the fridge to circulate the air, and outside the fridge
to circulate air, and adding a thermometer so you can see what is going
on inside.  You should be able to find it in the archives by searching for
&quot;fridge&quot;.

Those &quot;Igloo coolers that plug into the lighter socket&quot; are junk compared
to your fridge.  Don't waste your money.  They will only cool to 40 degrees
below the outside temp (105 - 40 = 65 degrees).
