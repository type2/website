My '85 is doing that now, and I went through this adventure a couple of
times in my '77. With the '77, the problem was the starter solenoid, but
only the dealer would sell the solenoid seperately. The jobber starter
came complete, and was not that much more money, so I ended up repacing
the whole starter.  I know this is probably not what you wanted to hear,
but if there's another solution I'm open to it.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a friend with an '86 Water-Cooled Vanagon who is complaining of a
&gt; &quot;mushy&quot; ignition. When engaged, it does not good contact right way, as if
&gt; the whole unit was way worn.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else had a similar problem or know of an inexpensive cure? Thanks
&gt; in advance!
