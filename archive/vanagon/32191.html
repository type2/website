&gt; Hi Gang:

&gt; Well, after 2000 km in my new EV Winnebago, I
&gt; am pained to tell the list that the heating
&gt; and defrosting is horrible.  We went skiing
&gt; yesterday (-20 C a.m., -14 C p.m.) and spent
&gt; the three hours of driving, scraper in hand,
&gt; just like the old beetles we had.
&gt;
&gt; So this is a warning to anyone who might be
&gt; contemplating an EV Winnebago - if you live
&gt; in an area where the mercury dips, don't do it!
&gt; This thing is DANGEROUS!

A possible solution, based on my own experiences in rainy weather last year
here in &quot;sunny&quot; SoCA with my EV GL (which, admittedly has rear air and
heat).  I find that in cold rainy or snowy weather, the only way to keep
the windows defrosted is to turn the dash control to the defrost positions
(invoking the air conditioner) and turning the air temp up.  Using the
heater draws too much damp air from outside, which doesn't help to dry out
the air inside that's wet from all the wet people and coats in the car.
The AC (with the temp turned up) dries the air as well as heats it.

Of course, the Winnie Bagoo is bigger than the GL and has no rear heat/AC,
I guess.
