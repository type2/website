Subject:      &lt;syncro&gt; 16'' fender extensions

Hi Tom, hi volks,
just read the discussion about the fitting of the PUR extensions. Don't know
if WINKLER sells original VW or just copies. The original VW parts can be
fitted to a syncro 14'' as Phill Lander told me. Phill is on a holiday throgh
Europe, but I hope to meet him next week-end and I ll try to ask him about
details.

I'll also forward pics showing a regular 16'' with the rear spare wheel rack
(which is neccessary for the 16'' wheels dont fit into the drawer below the
radiator) , a close up shot on 16'', two other stock 16'' Crew Cab, and
Phill's modified 14''

Till later Tom N.
