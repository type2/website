Subject: Buss GBC-type fuses

I found the WWW homepage of the Bussmann Division of Cooper Industries 
about their GBC fuses which were recommendet by Bob Hoover on this list a 
couple of days ago. 

http://www.buss-components_dot_com/cpd/autop2.htm

Contains some nice pictures about all their different types of automotive 
fuses.....
I'll definitely will replace mine with their GBC type ones.
