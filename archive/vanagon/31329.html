I've done it on a '63 bug.  Same job different scale.  My only 
recommendation is to put a paint mark on the ends of the torsion bars before 
you remove them.  That way, you will have a reference point if you lose 
track of how many splines you've turned the thing.  It is actually a 
pretty quick and easy job.  Mr Bently should have all the specs and 
proceedure.  Oh, two other notes of caution.  Don't chip the 
coating on the bar--any corrosion will cause it to fail, and don't mix the 
left and right sides.
