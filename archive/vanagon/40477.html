Subject: re: Bentley Manuals-Cheap Source/LiMBO

&gt;  I talked to a distribution house today (whose name I do not know)
&gt;  about a Jeep manual. Good prices. Turns out they also carry the
&gt;  Bentley manuals.
&gt;
&gt;  Price quoted for the 68-79 Bus manual was $35.00. Second-day
&gt;  ground shipping was an additional $4.

Ken,

If I'm not mistaken, LiMBO has a deal on Bentley manuals for the 68-79 Bus
quoted at $29.

Is there a LiMBO member out there who can verify?
