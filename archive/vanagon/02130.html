&gt; 
&gt; Hello VWers,
&gt;         My wife (Gabriella) and I are planning a long trip around America
&gt; as soon as I get this little thesis...thing... out of the way. If the
&gt; Bricks Across America (BOA) flies, then we would love to join up. I'm an
&gt; entomologist who has been stuck in a lab for 5 years, so I'm looking
&gt; forward to collecting insects en route. Gabriella works for Peet's coffee
&gt; and has her own truffel business on the side. Coffee, chocolate, insects,
&gt; and buses. Heaven.
&gt; 

Sure, I'm sure well see a few &quot;Bugs&quot; on the way. ;)

Sorry, could resist!
