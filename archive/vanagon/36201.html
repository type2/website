&gt;To All:

&gt;Here's the info on the cheapie harness replacement from Lars Herrnsdorf in
&gt;Gottenborg Sweden,  posted to the list last 11/17.  His English is a little
&gt;&quot;quaint&quot; but I believe it adds to the good homebrew flavor of his fix.  Good
&gt;luck!


Unsolicited endorsement, from a sample size of one vanagon:  This does work, 
cleared my probs immediately, so far for 14months now. My only rec. is that 
when installing simply pull back the rubber boot exposing the 4 wires that 
go to the connector. Find #s 2 and 4 and simply nick them for a 1/2&quot; or so 
to expose the bare copper.  Pry the wire out of the insulation by pushing a 
nail/knife under.  Then solder the capacitor right across the bared loops of 
copper.  No 15cm leads, no fighting with connector lugs etc. Use some 
electrical tape over the solder sites then tuck, everything neatly back 
inside the rubber boot.  The capacitor I used was a 25Volt 22microfarad 
tantalum type.  I read of mention of the stuttering problems not being 
completely solved with 10ufd size, quoted from a LIMBO article (via email) 
maybe?
