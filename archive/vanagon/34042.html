Subject: Re: electrical question

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;	I have a question.  I was out looking at a '78 bus today and I
&gt;	think I really like it but there was something weird going on
&gt;	with the hazard flashers and turn signals.  OK, none of the
&gt;	bulbs are burnt out, but when the key is in the on position, the
&gt;	turn signals don't work.  The indicator light on the dash comes
&gt;	on and stays on without blinking and none of the outside turn
&gt;	signal lights light up.  Same with the hazard flasher.  However,
&gt;	when the key is off, the hazard flashers work fine.  What could
&gt;	be causing this?  Is something wired wrong or is a relay
&gt;	defective or maybe a short circuit somewhere?  Please help as
&gt;	this bus only needs minimal work + paint and it would be pretty
&gt;	nice.
&gt;
&gt;	Sean

&gt;       Your problem is easy....at the base of the fuse box is a flasher
        relay box...this is bad...unplug and replace.
