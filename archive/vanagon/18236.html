Subject: Re:Rusty VanBondo Cartoon!! 8)

I talked to Tom Broulette last night and he said that he published the
cartoon that I send him in January in the upcoming NEATO newsletter. Watch
your mail boxes. Now you can see what &quot;I&quot; look like in print. Actually,
Rusty Van Bondo was/is the combination of all of the people that we all have
met or heard of within the VW world. Rusty likes to be on the edge of
rudeness and poke fun at the various aspects of the VW world. Jim Ellis is
actually a conservative, professional guy (;P)who wants to help everyone to
enjoy their VWs.
