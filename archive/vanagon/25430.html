&gt;I have a sinle port 1600 engine that came out of a 70 westy, i'd like to
&gt;convert it to d dual port as a spare for my 71 westy, is there anything I
&gt;need to do besides change the heads and manifold?  Everything else is the
&gt;same, right? TIA


Carb is different too (34 PICT vs. old 30 PICT)-- a smog carb, with
real finicky idle. I don't know if your 30PICT carb will bolt to the
'71 Dual-port manifold. If it does, the carb throat won't line up
perfectly with the manifold tube-- different diameters, at least.
This can affect high-speed running. I've seen adapter plates for this,
but they don't help the throat mismatch much.

Also, I believe the '71 busses came with doghouse oil cooler-- not a
&quot;mandatory&quot; mod, but it's nice to have.
