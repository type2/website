Subject: (fwd) - FS: 1989 Vanagon Syncro

|&gt; Anyone interested in a pristine vanagon syncro. It has the weekender
|&gt; package (a bed in the back and a vanity cabinet along the side). It is
|&gt; silver and grey with PW, PS, PL, Cruise Control, and a lot of camping
|&gt; extras. Although it has 86k miles it has had a lot of preventative
|&gt; maintenance done recently (brakes, exhaust, battery, etc). It is really in
|&gt; great shape. Anyone in New England or near Boston looking for a Westie
|&gt; should take a look at this. Asking $10,500.

This has been advertised a while now, don't sound to terribly
bad if entire exhaust replaced, talk to him not me, I merely forwarded.
