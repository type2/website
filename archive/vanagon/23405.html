Subject: Re: VW's new Web pages

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just tried it, but the graphic on the front page, which seems to be a
&gt;&gt;clickable image only takes me to itself. Huh? nice picture, but don't have
&gt;&gt;time to hang out there all day.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Same problem here. But try clicking on the *word* &quot;roadmap.&quot; Then, when it
&gt;says &quot;no data found&quot;, just click the RELOAD button.

Thanks! That worked.

Joe
