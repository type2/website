Subject: Re: Upgraded Brakes Bus/Vanagon?

Oh not that I should need to mention, but this of course is only possibly 
aplicable to pre 85 vans.  I also mention that somebody was offering 
cross drilled front rotors to further supplement Vanagon brakes think 
it was MSDS after installation of the Porsche into Syncro.  I would 
prefer gas slotted rotors myself as the puny 13mm rotors don't leave 
much to begin with.
