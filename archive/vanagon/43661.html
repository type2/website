Subject: Re: ! Magnesium grinding

&gt;flash you wouldn't believe, bright blueish white, I turned around
&gt;and saw my shadow on the opposite wall, i ran up into the kitchen
&gt;and the only thing i could grab was a pan of spinach, i ran down
&gt;again and trew it onto the bench, the magnesium allready stopped
&gt;burning, but the spinach put out the phone and some other things
&gt;that had cought fire.

Note to myself:  strap pan of spinach next to my fire extinguisher---just in
case.

&gt;And another thing, after all the things you might have read here on
&gt;the list you might be interested in burning an engine case, someone
&gt;might have told you allready but be carefull, porosities in the
&gt;casting can cause explosions that spread pieces of burning magnesium.
&gt;
&gt;I read that several cars burned out at the Bug Ins at Orange County
&gt;Raceway (if i have the name right) because of people burning cases.

Yeah, that's why we don't burn cases in the Northeast.  There aren't enough
aircooleds to go around here as it is, let alone us burning them down.
Those west coasters are so rich in aircooleds they got VWs to burn! ;-)

Stat: On my way to New Jersey last Saturday from Connecticut for the whole
trip I saw only one aircooled and it was a 74-77 bus.  It was just your
average daily driver looking westy, well beaten and battle scarred.  On the
return trip, zero buses spotted, but a couple bugs.

While at a flea market down there I spoke to an older couple selling
machinist tools (I'm still searching for a nice, used dial indicator).  It
turns out they had a '56 and '60 bug long ago and they were very happy to
reminisce about it.  After talking bugs for awhile I think a spark had been
rekindled and I wouldn't be surprised if they went out and bought another
bug after our conversation!  Many people seem interested/curious about my
bus and I usually get into such discussions in parking lots, but on the
whole I'd say the most interest comes from 5-16 year olds who've seen
pictures/movies with buses in them and are interested in giving it a
look-over.  A former co-worker's 3 year old had a truck book with a 68-72
pop top westy.  You didn't have to tell him what that fiberglass top does
(aside from banging around in the wind when you don't have the rubber seal!).
