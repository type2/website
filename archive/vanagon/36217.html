&gt; under the seats to the rear of the bus, and I discovered something!
&gt; To add insanity to confustion, stamped in the wall that divides the 
&gt; front bench from the rest of the bus, was the number: 299416.
&gt; Is this the manufacturing number?  
&gt; Remember the weirdness I am experiencing with this thing.  The 
&gt; title says '57, but the little id plate screwed into the engine 
&gt; compartment seems to indicate a '58 (Id number 325192)
&gt; So, is the ID number on the tag supposed to match the number on the 
&gt; bulk-head wall?

Mike,

VW apparently used shells from the end of one model year for
production early in the next model year.

I went to the DMV in 1984 to register a '70 bug that I had purchased
that had Missouri plates on it. The standard procedure here in
California is to verify the VIN before granting a California title.
The officer doing the verifying noticed that the metal ID plate at
the lower left corner of the windshield was loose. So he pulled out
the back seat and checked the number there.  Guess what?  The number
under the back seat was a '69 serial number, completely different
from the '70 id plate. 

What happened next was that I was arrested, taken to the detective's
office (yeah, they read me my rights and everything), and we
proceeded to call the Missouri DMV. The Missouri DMV was a joke. Not
only did they not have any record of the windshield VIN or the
back-seat VIN, they did not even have a record of the Missouri
license plate.  But since the detective could not find any record of
any of the numbers listed as being stolen, they decided that I wasn't
a thief and let me go. To get the car registered, I had to spend half
a day at a Highway Patrol office. The automotive detective of the CHP
said that he had seen this happen before, and that VW apparently used
shells from the end of one model year for production early in the
next model year on a regular basis. BTW, the VIN on the plate by the
spare tire was the same as the one at the windshield.

When I finally got the title cleared, it was registered as a 1984
VW bug with a 1969 VIN. Go figure.

Bottom line, if you don't want to have a registration problem,
check all the places where VW put a VIN before you go to the DMV.
