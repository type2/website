Subject: Re: 78 Westy questions

ou are correct on the batteries.An FI Westy that has set for 2 yrs. can 
have several problems.The injectors for one.Check all the hose's(and 
there are many) for cracks.Do a compression check just for fun.You want 
to try and eliminate the the possible problems first such as the motor.
