&gt;If you import the car to here,

(Germany),

&gt;you need to have a certificate of the KBA
&gt;(something like DOT) that the car has never been registered as stolen and a 

&gt;certification from VW Kundendienst that according to the VIN the car 
fulfils
&gt;the local regulations. Than it has to be examined by the TUV (see 
VANAGON_dot_com
&gt;dictionary) and off you go.

There is a specialist at TUV Manheim, collecting all US vehicle data sheets
which is need for final easy German licensing. Maybe he owns the US spec
Vanagon sheets.
