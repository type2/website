Subject: Re: Advice Needed: Poptop Seal - 82D Westflailia



&gt;I am going to do it!  The old, crusty, rotted seal is going to be 
&gt;replaced.  But with what - and from whom?
&gt;
&gt;I've seen many sugestions for poptop seals.  What do you prefer?  
&gt;I once read of a seal made with aluminum (rustproof) clips.  Does 
&gt;nayone have any info?  Are the aftermarkets as good as the OEM?  
&gt;What are my choices?
&gt;
My friend and I just installed a new canvas we got from Marc 
McCullough (poptops_at_leonardo_dot_net) on his '71 Westy.  We were VERY 
impressed with the quality and price of the canvas.  As I recall, 
his literature also indicated that he sells rust-proof seals at 
what seem to be very good prices.  While I haven't seen the seals, 
I would expect them to be as nice as his canvas since pop-tops are 
his only business.
