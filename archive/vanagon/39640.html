&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;MattyJ and Suz have made it to Vancouver!

I am glad to hear it!  They were here a bit ago and sent us a book from
bend, oregon.  If anyone sees them tell them that my wife (Lucille) and I
say hi!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Their trip so far?  They were much impressed with Thom Fitzpatrick's '56
&gt;bus, and had confidence Thom could revive the '54 that Steve Johnson likes
&gt;to make fun of.  They had good things to say about Steve as well.  Marlon
&gt;in Stockton got good reviews for his choice in beverages, and for his sheer
&gt;stamina.  I'm sure I'm missing a ton of people out here, but apparently my
&gt;stamina is no match for Marlon's, as I'm kinda slow today.

Hehehehe, well, we *DID* got through almost 2 liters of Vodka AND I went to
the dentist the next morning at 8:00 AND went to work AND installed an
electrical outlet in their bus.  I guess I surprised meself!

&gt;
&gt;They lost their clutch cable near Olympia, WA, and needed to have it
&gt;adjusted again in Vancouver.  Time is a bit tight for me these days, so I
&gt;recommended they go to my trusted (believe it!) VW mechanic (Alfred Lal at
&gt;Vancouver West Motors) and he did them up right.  It's been raining
&gt;monsoon-style here for a few days, and will for probably nearly a week
&gt;more, so I'm not sure how much longer they can hold out in our rainforest
&gt;here.

I hope they got the seal on their hatch fixed as it leaked all over Suz
last time they camped.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So that's about it.  They're happy, healthy, and loving every minute of
&gt;their trip.  They're driving a medium blue/white 1970 westy proudly
&gt;displaying a vanagon list sticker.  If you see them around, give them a
&gt;honk, and pull over for a chat!
&gt;

Bullwinkle I think they call it.  Tobin, did they have any Bullwinkle soda
left?  Ah, a mightier drink I have not experienced.  I have pictures I need
to get a scanner and get them on my web page.  WIll let the list know when
they are up.

BTW, Lazarus (the '69 Westy of mine) is in the body shop getting a new pain
job since I do not have the facilities for it.  I *DID* manage to drop the
engine on the parts bus.  All by myself.  First time I have done that!  NOW
I have to rebuild it.

Anyhoo, next list member they hit has to tell the tale.  Hopefully, if all
goes well Lucille and I will be doing the same thing Matt &amp; Suz are doin'
in about a year!
