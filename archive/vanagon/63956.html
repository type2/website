Subject: oil temp sender install
Date: Mon, 18 Aug 97 08:53:35 EDT

First off, thanks to ron at bus depot for going out of his way to get =
me some 
parts i wanted for the maiden voyage of my 80 westy.

second, uh-oh, i think i messed up.  i removed the oil pump cover as dire=
cted in 
the directions for the oil temp sender (411/914-4 engines).  drilled a =
9/16&quot; hole
according to those same directions.  went to install the cover back in =
place 
and find that i cant't get the two mounting bolts lined up because the =
sender 
interferes with metal inside engine block.  maybe my drilled travelled =
alittle 
when drilling but the result is irreversible so i need a new oil pump =
cover.  
hopefully i can find one at a junkyard.  anybody know of another source?

so, on my next try can i pick a spot on the cover with more clearance? =
 it 
seems you only have to worry about the dipstick contacting the sensor?
also i noticed when i removed the cover there is a slot that wraps part =
way 
around the oil pump cover cavity about 3 inches long by 3/8&quot; high.  the =
edges of 
this slot were kind of chewed up.  there was no metal bits laying around =
in 
there so i don't think it is recent damage?  what is the purpose of this =
slot?  
just an path?


wiring the temp gauge was quite easy by the way.    looks like i'll be =
taking the 
windstar to cape cod  (business, not camping).

any advice will be appreciated.

thanks
