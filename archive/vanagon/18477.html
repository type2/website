&gt;71-79 or some such).  Unfortunately, the sleeve in the lower end of
&gt;the shock will not fit over the stud on the bus.  The
&gt;currently-installed shocks don't have a sleeve on the lower end, just
&gt;the rubber bushing. 

Well, this is the way my '69 is.  I just ended up prying out the sleeve,
a royal pain in the butt.  Use lots of grease to get the rubber bushing
onto the arm.  

Seems like several of us have *orphan* buses, or something like that,
that the shock manufacturers no longer support.  Good luck.
