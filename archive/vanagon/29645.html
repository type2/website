Subject: Help! Head Question.

I have a 2.0 Lt Type 4 engine that I am doing a top end rebuild on.  This 
is the first time I have ever attempted anything like this... The heads I 
pulled off of my engine do not say VW on them anywhere,  the only marking 
on them is a large &quot;AMC.&quot;  I hear that this means that these are Spanish 
heads.  Are these worth rebuilding? Are they &quot;good&quot; cores?  Are Spanish 
heads an inferior to VW made heads?  Is it worth paying a couple of 
hundred more for VW heads?

	Thank You.
