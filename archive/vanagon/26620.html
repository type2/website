&gt;Hi Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;I guess I should give a small introduction to myself.  I have owned an 1987
&gt;Camper for 7 years.  It has seen the inside of a dealership only twice.
&gt;Both reasons were because ECM died and left me stranded and in shock that
&gt;such an incredibly engineered item could go down - twice - within a year!
&gt;Otherwise, I have done all the maintenance myself and tried not to get
&gt;dealers involved.
&gt;
&gt;I normally put about 60000 km a year on the van.  I do a lot of travelling
&gt;all around NA to support my addiction to white water kayaking and other
&gt;summer winter activities.  I live in the Toronto region of Ontario
&gt;(Newmarket to be specific) and am interested in dealing with other Camper
&gt;owners in the area to see where they get their parts and service info.
&gt;
&gt;I hope to be able to get info and share whatever I can about my van.

I count 540,000 km. Tell me it's true (I own an '87, too)!

I met a Toronto guy who had put 750,000 km on a Rabbit Diesel. Had 250,000
on his new Jetta, four yrs old at the time.
