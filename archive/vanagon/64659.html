Subject:      sighting of van

i am at loyola college right now and in the jenkins hall/humanities
building parking lot, there is a silver vanagon GL with weekender
package(rear facing second row, rear seat folds down to bed, table
in between 2nd and 3rd rows).  has a desmnd's sticker on rear bumper.

i was wondering how i would convert a vanagon into one with weekender
package?

thanks,
sudhir desai
