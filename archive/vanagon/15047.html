Saturday, 4/8/95 Phoenix Bug-o-Rama
One show that is happening is the Phoenix Bug-o-Rama to be held at Firebird
International Raceway, Phoenix, Arizona. General directions are: Take the
I-10 freeway to the Maricopa Road exit and drive West 1/4 mile or until you
see hoards of VWs. The exit is located slightly south of Phoenix. 
&gt;From California SD-LA:
If coming from California procede east through Phoenix and head toward
Tucson. Maricopa Road is aproximately four-five miles south of the I-60
(360)/Superstition Freeway junction. 
&gt;From Tucson:
Coming from Tucson the same exit is roughly two exits north of the Riggs
Road exit. Good advice if part swapping/car selling is to arrive early,
(06:00-06:30) and get in line. Admission is $14.00 per person (!) plus $3.00
per vehicle parking.
&gt;From Flagstaff/Colorado/Northern NM:
Take I-17 south from Flagstaff to Phoenix. Procede through Phoenix following
signs to  I-10 to Tucson. See directions from California at this point.

When in doubt, see latest Hot VWs or VWt&amp;a Magazines for more details.

See you all there. Look for either a '57 single cab or a 83 White Vanagon
Campmobile. Stop and say hello.
