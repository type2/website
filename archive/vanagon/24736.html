Subject: '62 Wiring


Hi,


   Well i have had my '62 camper for over a year now and this weekend with a bit 
of luck i should have it back at home in it's new spray job. Now all i have left to
do is fit the engine, build an interior, put the new glass and rubber in, and         completely re-wire it from skratch (the previous owner removed all the interior       and wiring for some reason and never put it back). I know you must get asked this 
all the time but does anybody have a wiring diagram for a '62 6 volt bus. If anybody
 has i would be very grateful as this seems to me an impossible job.

p.s.
Anybody got any tips also on re-wiring.

Cheers,

        Ben Ryan
