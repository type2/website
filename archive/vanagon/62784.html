We just have ours attached with safety belts.  Where are you installing the seats?

A long, long time ago when faced with the same situation with my '81 I 
attached the anchors using the bolts that hold the middle seat to the 
body.  I seem to recall that I made a small &quot;X&quot; slit in the carpet above 
where the bolts were and then threaded an appropriate (longer) bolt 
through the anchor, through the carpet, and into the welded nut on the 
chassis.
