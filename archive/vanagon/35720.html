Subject: Timing '72 with no vacuum

Listees:

        I am progressing on my '72 camper, but the distributor is a
mechanical advance only Bosch (don't know what number).  What does anyone
suggest the timing should be set at?  All the books say 5 degree ATDC - but
this assumes there is a vacuum module attached.  I have it running at about
0 at idle, but am dissatisfied with the &quot;load&quot; response if the RPM are not
high.  Also, does anyone have any specs what the overall mechanical advance
range should be?  It looks like this one is running about 20 degrees advance
when I rev it up.  BTW, thought I had an alternator problem (light stays on)
, but found out last night that the PO had wired the high beam indicator to
that!  Oh, the tangled webs we weave when first we practice to hack up wiring.
        Any ideas or suggestions are appreciated.  
        Oh, I thought I read something on the subject on the net suggesting
that vacuum units were for wimpy DE-troit iron, but it would be nice, I think.

Thanks in advance,
Chris Vaughn
