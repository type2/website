&gt; Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to

&gt; been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
&gt; often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
&gt; &quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

As others have already said, you're largly ignored.  I've only been pulled
over once four years I've had mine, and that was because the brake lights
weren't working.  After stepping on the pedal so that I could look, he just
told me to get them fixed and let me go.  The only other response I've had
from cops is that one drove in front of me and laughed when he saw my bus. 
I don't really think it's funny looking... much.
