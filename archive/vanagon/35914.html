No, not yet. :-(

I'm still waiting for that magic (bus) where everything converges: model, 
condition, miles, color, and last but not least price and spare cash. 
While I keep tabs on the Seattle VW area dealers, if anyone sees a nice 
Eurovan at an off brand (non-VW) dealer, I'd appreciate a direct email 
message. Given the EV's relative scarcity, I am willing to expand my 
search area. While the Western US is my primary interest, I have 
relatives in OH, WI, NY (city), MA, CA (Riverside County).

Thanks,
