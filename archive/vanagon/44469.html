&gt; 
&gt;         Has any one here in California had any problems,
&gt;         with the newly formulated gas in yer busses???
&gt; 
&gt;         Besides less gas milage!
&gt; 

     YES!!!!!

   Many of our customers, (VOLKS CAFE) have been having troble with the 
new clean fuel!  I personally had it clog up one of my injectors in my 
water-cooled VW (scirocco) and it stayed clogged for about 2 days then 
cleared itself back up.

   I recieved a phone call from a person traveling from Colorado and he 
was worried he had an engine problem, his mileage had gone from about 
20-22 to 14-16 since he had entered California.

  I know that the gas people are trying to ake less Smog and have the 
fuel burn cleaner but what we've found in our customer cars is that it 
is making the engines runn hotter.  Many valve seats have dropped 
recently due to temperatures being very high in that engine.

  The only thing that is consistent is that the fuel had changed just 
prior to these problems happening!

  On the Web page that I keep we have set up a page tp talk about what 
people think about the Clean Fuel and other problems that they might be 
having with it too!  Feel free to comment about it and we will be 
keeping everyone that is concerned up to date on this matter.
