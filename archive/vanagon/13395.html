&gt;Kombi - A bus with a camper interior, featuring bed, storage space, etc.

Nope!  There are a lot of Kombis outfitted as campers, but being a camper 
doesn't make it a kombi!

A kombi had not interior, save for optional seats, which were put in to 
qualify it as a passenger vehicle and get around import restrictions
on commercial vehicles at the time...
