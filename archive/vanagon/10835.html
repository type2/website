I thought I'd update Joel's listing with info as I knew it. Some groups 
have new addresses, some are gone, some have merged, and I've added two 
new ones to the list.

Bulli-Kartei
c/o Jochen Brauer
Brandholzweg 1
58456 Witten
GERMANY
FAX: 02302/75039
Tel: 02302/75907

Primarily for the older ones, pre-'68, but a smattering of new ones show 
up from time to time. They produce a magazine 2 or 3 times a year and 
several smaller bulletins to keep members up to date. Aside from the 
occassional English word or phrase, though, all is in Deutsch.
NEATO &amp; Bulli-Kartei have a membership exchange program wherby you can 
join B-K through NEATO and save the hassle of sending an international 
money order.

Split Screen Van Club
c/o David Eccles
&quot;Brambly House&quot;
93 Dunton Road
Broughton Astley, Leics. LE9 6NA
U.K.

The SSVC is perhaps the oldest Vintage VW Bus (Van) club, older then even 
SOTO in US, and far more together. Bi-monthly magazine with lots of tech 
help and stories. Big on camping, as most Splitties in UK were converted 
into campers (heavy regulations on imported commercial vehicles created 
local camper conversion companies like Dormobile, Devon, Canterbury-Pitt, 
etc.) NEATO and SSVC will likely have membership exchange program in 
future, but for now you must contact them directly.

NEATO, Bulli-Kartei, and the SSVC are producing a calendar for 1996. 
Copies will be available in July '95.

More info on all, contact: Tom Brouillette c/o NEATO:(505) 268-2220

OR Tom c/o rmart_at_unm_dot_edu

Thanks!
