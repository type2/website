Subject: Re: VW campers in Costa Rica

I'm unsubscribing, but I'll be back.
Quite unexpectedly the job is sending me off to Costa Rica for a fortnight.
Looks like a panic job, but I'm hoping to be able to get a day in San Jose
to check out the VW camper rental outfit for sale. For the short
description in the last issue of Hot VWs it looked intriguing . If I find
out anything I'll post a summary when I get back.
