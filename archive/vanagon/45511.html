 Has anybody ever drilled out the orifice in the burner valves of a Westy
 stove ? I've been thinking about trying to increase the output of the 2
 burners.  I firgure that I can go up 1 or 2 sizes and dramatically increase
 the usefulness of the stove. Any thoughts or suggestions are always
welcomed.

The stove jets are sized the way they are for a reason.  Besides safety,
increasing the gas flow will upset the air mix characteristics which will
cause a yellow flame, soot, and lots of  Carbon monoxide.
