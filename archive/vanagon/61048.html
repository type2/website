&gt; I looked in the bentley for the resistance of the coolant

Shoot!  I wanted the resitance of the coolant temperature sender -- for the
dash. NOT the computer.

&gt; For the temp gauge refer to page 90.21 of the bentley. 
&gt; for the needle to be in position &quot;I&quot; the sender resistance equals about
&gt; 430 ohms. This is the cold region. For the needle to be in the &quot;II&quot;
&gt; position sender resistance equals 30 ohms. This is the hot region.

The temperature sender I have has 700 ohms cold and 150 ohms at about 200
degrees.  This is why I desparately need to know what the resistance in the
termperature sender for the diesel is!

&gt; For the gas gauge an input resistance of 210 ohms equals empty. 35 ohms

Are you assuming that the Bentley numbers are ohms?  They
aren't.  Where did you get those numbers?  The Bentley that I have shows 55
full and 560 empty (90.5) for the gas gauge, but this is not resistance in
ohms as the resistance in ohms is actually 50 ohms full and 150 empty from the
level sender directly.

&gt; &gt;Ok, you're the only one with a diesel who has responded.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You are saying that the resistance between the wire and ground cold of 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;temperature sender for the dash is 22 ohms? Or do you have them 
&gt; &gt;backwards?  If
&gt; &gt;you do and it's really 2000 ohms for the resistance of the sender, 
&gt; &gt;then this
&gt; &gt;is very good news.  The resistance on the gas sender is about 700 ohms 
&gt; &gt;cold.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I have an instrument cluster problem that has plagued me since I 
&gt; &gt;put 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the gas
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;engine in my diesel vanagon a year ago.  To get closer to solving 
&gt; &gt;it I 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;come up with two things I don't know.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1. Would someone with a diesel vanagon tell me what the room temp 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;resistance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   of their temperature sensor is. 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;2. Would some elctronic type out there tell me what red red black 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;white means
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   on a resistor. (It measures about 20 Ohms).
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks
