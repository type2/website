Subject: estimating :^)

Hey Folks, 
I always knew I was bad at estimating: distance, time, etc.
Today, i found out how bad my estimating skills REALLY are.
All along, after installing a new clutch cable, I thought the freeplay
in the pedal was fine(.5-1&quot;).
Well, after having really bad shifting lately, I decided to get out a ruler
and see what the freeplay actually is.  It turns out the freeplay was 2&quot;.
NO WONDER I COULDN'T SHIFT!
I adjusted the freeplay to specs, and it now shifts like new.

Thanks for all the suggestions about the problem.
Paul
