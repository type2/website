&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I never opened the VW anti-freeze but have heard from you all that its
&gt;&gt;blue.  Is it really noticeably blue?  This stuff looks very very green.
&gt;&gt;Did I get ripped off?  Could I be mistaken?  Thanks for any help.  Please
&gt;&gt;cc: me or e-mail direct.

I just bought a jug from my local VW dealer. Yes, it is very blue (before
mixing with water). After mixing it is still very blue. Are you sure you got
the right one from your dealer or your mechanics indeed ripped you off? Mine
has big &quot;Autobahn antifreeze &amp; summer coolant&quot; words on the bottle.
