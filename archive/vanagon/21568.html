 A couple more data points on the chassis reinforcment thread:

 Neither of the Westies I've had, a '72 and a '74, is fitted with the 
 previously mentioned reinforcment plates. Both have pop-tops. My '64 camper
 also had the stock undercarriage, but it was a domestically built hardtop 
 camper based on a Kombi.
