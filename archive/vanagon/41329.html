&gt; &gt;I used to have to use a four-foot cheater to get mine off. Not just dry,
&gt; &gt;but almost 30 years old. They came off with the most awful creeeeaaaaakkk

&gt; Boy did you guys miss a sight!  Sunday, we removed the front wheels from the
&gt; '79 by means of me standing on one side of a 2' X-wrench, holding the other,
&gt; and bouncing a bit.  Fortunately, there was a list member behind me to catch
&gt; me as I went ass over teakettle, and four more to laugh.  I HATE MECHANICS
&gt; WHO ARE SO DAMN PROUD OF THEIR 600 FT/LB PNEUMATIC WRENCHES!!!!

Yeah, and you guys should have seen that lug wrench when he was done!
It was (and I say was!) one of those 4-post cross types but Steve
actually managed to bend the thing getting those nuts off.  Wow :) .

I think I was one of the laughing four :) .
