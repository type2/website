&gt; And so, I'm lookin' for other ideas.  Anybody painted their bus anything but
&gt; stock color?  Any interesting design suggestions?  (This bus is far from stock
&gt; with no chance of returning to stock so I'm not worried about keeping it
&gt; the original color.

Being from Tucson, you might appreciate this: My Bus is red with
the white top, right?  I had a thought once of painting white
grout lines on the sides to make it look like brick, and writing
&quot;BEAR DOWN&quot; in big black block letters on the roof, but I thought
better of it.
