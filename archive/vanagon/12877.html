Subject: RE: Replacement seats

Geoff,

Why not try to find a pair of Captain's chairs from a late model Westie...  
Seems to me that that would be the easiest solution.... they're made for a 
Vanagon and they swivel, recline, have armrests etc.....

      Jon

Any body got any adivice on replacing the front seats in 82 camper. I would like
something a little more luxurious. I read and article about a guy who had used 
front seats from a Passat. Any body got any experince in this area.
Looking forward to hearing from anyone.
