Subject: High Idle

Hello fellow listies
     I just wanted to thank the list as a whole.  You have saved me money
yet again.  I have had a problem with the idle on my '86, it idled at about
2000 rpm.  It started doing this out of the blue.  My van has always had a
high idle usually about 1100 to 1200 rpm.  It kinda bothered me but was not
enough of a problem to warrant troubleshooting.  After reading the archives
and several of the testing procedures wiritten by brilliant individuals (you
know who you are!!) I found several causes each of which reduced the rpm
back to the factory spec of 880 +-50 rpm.  I now have an idle speed of 900
rpm and it is rock steady.  With the lists help I found the following problems.

1.  Dirty connections on the idle stabilizer control unit.
2.  Dirt and crap inside the idle stabilizer valve.
3.  Incorrectly adjusted limiting screw on the throttle valve.
4.  Throttle valve switch not closing at idle.
5.  Dirty connection of O2 sensor.

     When the high idle first started, I thought I was going to have to
replace the O2 sensor.  With the lists help and a little elbow grease I have
curred the problem.  Thank you all again.
