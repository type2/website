Subject: What Van was that?

OK,

I'm heading down the Geelong Road after leaving work the Friday before
Christmas - I'm musing (read wishing) about getting a new board and have just
about decided it gonna be a sort of thruster/mini malibu cross about 6'10&quot;
(what do you think? seems I could get the best of both worlds) which is much
more suited to my age, knees and back than my current 5'11&quot; when I pass this VW
camper van..... It was the strangest beast I'd ever seen.....

It was LHD and had European or English plates (no country or State on them
though). From the back it looked most like my 76 bus (similar tail-lights etc).
 From the front it looked a caravelle (or transporter or whatever).  In fact it
looked like the 'newer' (post 80) front end grafted onto on 'older' (73-79)
back end.  It had a chrome badge saying 'T21' (italic script) on the grille
below the windscreen.  It had a HUGE box top at LEAST half as high as a normal
bus again.  The box top had a 'Westphalia' sticker/logo on the rear right hand
side.  On top of this it had a HUGE floored luggage rack (or was it a sun deck
8-) ???). It was watercooled (had what looked like a radiator grille anyway)
and it didn't sound or smoke like a diesel.......

What was this vehicle?
