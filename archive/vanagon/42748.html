Subject: Busses by the Arch

I was wondering how many other listmembers will be at Busses by the Arch
this weekend?  I know Sami will be there, and I plan on attending at least
for Saturday.  I'll of course be driving the blue '73 Safare with the
snazzy list sticker in the rear window.  Would be nice to meet up with
other listmembers there...
