Subject: A neat idea for vanagon protection
Date: Sun, 15 Jan 1995 03:02:10 -0700 (MST)

Sometime ago, I inquired about antitheft devices for the vanagon (diesels).
Amazingly, I saw this in the newsgroup alt.revenge.  It seems that this same
idea could be used on the diesel vanagons on the fuel pump, I think.  
(I edited the header a bit to shorten it here)
