Subject:      Need Advice Re: '91 Westie FS

Saw this ad (with picture) today and became instantly enthusiastic about
it. Here's what the ad says: &quot; '91 Westfalia camper, 74k miles, 4 spd, =
air,
stereo cassette, full camper, $18,995&quot;. It's a dealer selling it. Spoke =
to
dealer on the phone and was told that the vehicle is &quot;very clean&quot; and =
that
all the camping stuff works well.

I'm as green as they come - I've never owned a Volkswagen, let alone a
Westie or any other VW bus, but for a number of reasons I'm determined =
that
a Westie will be my next vehicle. Would some of the more experienced
readers out there tell me what I should look for when I go check the bus
out in the morning (Friday, 9a)? Also, how does the price look? Fair? Too
much? How much would *you* offer, if you were in my shoes?

I know this is a tall order, and I do have some general ideas of my own,
but anything that you can tell me would be appreciated. Is 74k miles a =
lot
for this model year? Any engine breakdowns on the immediate horizon with
that mileage? Sure looks pretty in the picture (silver w/ gray interior),
and I've been holding out, trying to find a '91 since it seems to be the
consensus here that it was the best year for Westies.
