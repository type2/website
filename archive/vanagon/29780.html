Yowser!!!  Who's been giving you a quote of $240?  My BusStop
catalog has '72 mechanical fuel pumps for $25.  I've seen in
manuals that you're supposed to remove the engine to change
it but have heard (here on the list, I think) that you
can just barely get it out with the engine in the car.

Good luck!!!!
