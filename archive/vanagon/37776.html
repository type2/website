&gt; Recently, a fellow purporting to be a mechanic happened across the
&gt; archive and took me to task over the 'Jugs'  article saying many of the
&gt; same things I heard from that other fellow twenty years ago.  (This fellow
&gt; referred to my continual emphasis on attention to detail as 'anal
&gt; retentive' which shows he knows even less about psychology in
&gt; general and the theories of Sigmund Freud in particular, than he
&gt; does about auto mechanics.)
&gt;

&gt; 
That's right, if anything, Bob would be anal obsessive-compulsive :) .
Anal retentive refers to people who are messy and generally disordered
according to Freud (contrary to public opinion -- ever notice that lots
of things are contrary to public opinion?).  

Sean, 
who paid attention in his Abnormal Psychology class last semester.

P.S.  By the way, that was another great article/story/sermonette, Bob.
Keep them coming.
