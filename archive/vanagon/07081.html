If I recall correctly, while both old (84) and new (85+) sliding door
mechinisms have a latch at the rear of the door, the latch pin
for lack of a better term on the old design is parallel to the side
of the van while the newer design has the pin at a 45 degree angle to
the side of the van.  The old design required all of the doors motion to
be at right angles to the side of the van before the door would latch.
This took a harder &quot;slam&quot;. The new design allows the door to latch while
the movement of the door still has a component that is parallel to
the side of the van.  The onlt _bad_ thing about having a slider that
closes so easily, is when my american van owning friends close the
slider on my vanagon, they just about tear it off the hinges  :-)
