&gt;scratch.  Unless...... VW could have changed the metalurgy in the new heads
&gt;to make them less prone to corrosion. 

Newest heads have gold coloured cadmium coatings, just like all the
underside bolts did when they were new. Another winner by VW I'd say. ;&gt;
 I still say JBWeld is your cheapest coating and pit filler, and at 100K kms
and counting it seems to have been a permanent fix for my two vans.  tim
