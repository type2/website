&gt;As I look at it there are 6 screws [removed]. The cover is loose but cannot
&gt;be lifted because it catches on the plastic heater duct directing louvres
&gt;sort of things.

what i did was to get a small fine-tooth saw and saw out the middle bottom
front part, below the louvres. carefully saw out, that is. otherwise you
have to remove the kick-panel of the rear seat just to get the stupid cover
off. the cover stays on very nicely without that little part.

but i would suggest removing the middle seat first ... it makes it a whole
lot easier to get at the thing. :)
