Subject: Re: Copy of: Front speaker replacement

Check the wires right at the hinges. Lots of times the wire breaks inside
the insulation, looks OK but don't connect.
&gt;
&gt;I guess I'm just lucky - or are '88s different? My speakers came out 
&gt;fine, although the driver's side wiring is somehow dead...
