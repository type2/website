Hi list Volks,
For those who were wondering what the german stuff at

The remarks in [] should help to understand when very specific european 
details are mentioned

Thanks for your patience !

Based on the Transporter
Off-Roader from VW
============
According to the imaginations of VW chairman Ferdinand Piêch there will be a 
VW off-roader available in 2001 at latest.
Plans to build up the new project upon the platform of the new generation IV 
Golf have been abondoned. To compete with established Off-Road vehicles like 
the Mitsubishi Pajero [dont know the other international names] or Ford 
Explorer VW decided to use the Transporter as basis. [Most likely a future one 
- because the current T4 will be eleven years old in 2001] Besides the future 
&quot;Drei-Liter-Auto&quot; [extremely fuel economic and low emission small size vehicle 
with a consumption of 3l/100km ( =80mls/gallon approx.)] the 4x4 will be the 
2nd aluminium vehicle within the VW group [after the A8]. As AUDI plans to 
launch only a 4WD sport-utility station-wagon based on the A6 TDI avant 
quattro, instaed of a real off-road vehicle, it might be the part of Porsche 
to develop a spotive derivate which will be on the market at the same time as 
the VW.
