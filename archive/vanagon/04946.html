Subject:      syncro video

ok, i watch the History of the VW Bus tape last night, and yes, it does
have about 10 seconds of a syncro bus out in the desert. one shot of it
leaping over a sand dune, and another shot of it tearing down a 'road'
with the front wheels obviously churning away in the foot deep sand.

the whole seqment on the bus lasts about 7 minutes or so. even got the
eurovan on it. not a whole lot on the bread-loaf. :(

but! for those of you who haven't run across it, it's from
Wild About Wheels        (508) 264-9926
P.O.Box 2003             make check payable to Global Television Network, LTD.
Acton, MA 01720-6003

$12.95 per episode (1992 catalog)

here are the episodes (IMHO) which pertain to vw's and buses:
&lt;each tape has 4 segments on it, i'm listing only the vw-related seqment&gt;

Order #  Episode
WAW038    38     - The Volkswagen Microbus, the First Mini-Van. An exclusive
                   story about the first mini home-on-wheels.

WAW032    32     - Proving Grounds: Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien.  We visit VW's
                   test track: with 80 miles of roads, it's a town in itself.

WAW035    35     - The People's Car: A History of VW. The history of the
                   Beetle, one of the best-loved cars of all time.

and, of course, there are other episodes that might appeal to other interests
so you need to get a catalog brochure.
