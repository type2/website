Subject:  Ottawa recommendation 

I take my 76 van  to Wally Becker's on Wellington St. They seem OK.
I chose them by calling autp part suppliers and asking for  reccomendations.
A few mentioned Wally Becker's as being good.. 
A few said don't go to Angelo's on Baseline Rd.
Most said they couldn't give out these sort reccomendations.
Note they could be commenting on speed of payment, not quality of service.
Wally's seems both honest, and competent, however they haven't done any major
work for me yet, just some exhaust work, routine maintainance, new fuel
injectors... You know the small $1200.00 type jobs;-)

&gt;Message-ID: &lt;199607011418.KAA14610_at_smtp1.sympatico_dot_ca&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone recommend a reliable garage or dealer/service place in Ottawa, Ont.  
&gt;Any 
&gt;guesses on what replacement of an idle air stabilizer valve should cost (the 
&gt;idle is 
&gt;low and unstable on our '90 Westfalia (71,000km) and that what I've been told 
&gt;the 
&gt;cure is (I'm a bit skeptical).  E-mail if possible, please - I just subscribed 
&gt;to the 
newsgroup.  Thanks.  Neil Mitchell.
