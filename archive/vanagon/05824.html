	Thom,
	Was I you, (and the best evidence suggests that I am not) I would
go for the highly recommended short block. Unless you're really strapped
for cash, I'd go with new pistons and cylinders too. You haven't mentioned
what happened to the case of your beloved '67, but I note you're looking
for a new case, so I'd also recomend you have a shop check-over your heads.

	They're probably fine, but this is the time to make them perfect,
not just good. Wear shouldn't be a problem, although I'd check for it, but
flatness is open to question, since they went through a fire.

	OTOH, if you really enjoy building engines, the money's a wash and
just think of all the fun you'll have!!

	If the 40hp was still running when you extracted it, I might be
interested in it and its accessories. I'd use it as an instructional aid
for the Odessey of the Mind team I coach. The can't use gasoline engines,
but these kids don't know much about the practical, physical, world. A
40Hp VW engine would be a good place to start. Shoot- if I got a tranny
case I could bolt-on a starter and RUN the thing.

	Peace,
	Bill
