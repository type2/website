Subject: VWAG in WIRED Special Edition

Just a passing observence. 

In an article of sorts relating to life in the future, WIRED suggests that
VWAG will, in the year 2088, be in the business of producing a product which
allows a couple (individual?) to choose the gender of their yet unconceived
child. Called &quot;KinderChoose&quot; is to be produced by the dozen. Rusty wonders
if they are cheaper by the dozen... ;)  If they will forgo the &quot;Concept One&quot;
for the &quot;Conceive One.&quot; I'd like to see the prototype. SCENARIOS: WIRED
Special Edition, page 91.
