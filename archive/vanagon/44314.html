Subject: Great Loop/Camping site north of San Francisco

Ron,

There is this park.... indeed there is an entire loop that I recommend
highly.  Alas, It is a fair drive north from SF (about 6hrs), so it is not
exactly what you are looking for but I mention it in case you are
thinking &quot;wine country&quot;. Last two times I went west I did
this same loop
and enjoyed it immensely both times.  I hope some of the more local people
can flesh this out/correct my bad memory (hint, hint)


Start at a town called Ferndale (great Victorian architecture), about 6hrs
N. of SF on 101. Exit town heading for the coast (west).  The road is a
bit hard to find but you will know you are on the right one if your van
assumes a position fitted for bleeding a Vanagon.  The towns it heads for
on the coast are Capetown (which does not really exist) and Petrolia.
This is an extrememly steep and windy road both going up and going down,
but the eagles soaring in the pass are worth it, as is the overlook to the
ranch on the way down and the first sight of the ocean.  BE CAREFUL! on
the way down.  I overheated my brakes and came near to losing them
entirely.  Stop for a &quot;beauty break&quot; half way down or at the first whiff
of brakes and you will be fine.

After you hit the coast head south ~25 mi to the next town, Honeydew, and
cut back inland.  The pass is not quite as steep as the way in, but still
exciting and leads you down into the Humboldt Redwood State Park from the
back.  If you time it right (start from Ferndale at ~10:00AM), you will
get to the first campsites at ~4-5:00 PM.  Pull in there.  It is, as I
remember, $14/night, solar showers and free (redwood) firewood. We loaded
the van and had redwood fires for the next week :-)  The next day you can
take the road through some of the finest forest scenery in the world, and
then back on 101.

I don't believe they take reservations, but it is far enough &quot;back of
beyond&quot; that we had no trouble getting a site in late May on a Friday
evening.
