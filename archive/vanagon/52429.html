 Did anyone hear about an incident in Idaho where a one year was 
 killed by the air bag in the passenger seat of a new Jetta?
 
 A very tragic story, made even more maddening because airbags were 
 legislated into place with seemingly little research into their 
 overall effect on safety. And no doubt, auto makers like VW will pay 
 the price in bad press and law suits, not unlike Audi did ten years 
 ago. Just one more sad example where politicians mess with things and 
 everyone else pays.... &gt;&gt;

Let's not blame the politicians or the auto makers completely.  We must first
ask why a small child was sitting in the front seat to begin with?  Even
withiut air bags, children should not sit up front.  Many states even have
laws restricting children to the back seat.  A one year old should be in a
safety seat mounted in the center of the rear seat.  This is the safest place
to be.  In this location, accident would have to extremeley bad for child to
get hurt.  Think about it.
