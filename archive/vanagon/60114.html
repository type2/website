&lt;&lt; My newly-purchased '91 Carat has a digital dash clock, which is fine,
 but which is set to the wrong time, which is less fine.  Unfortunately,
 the two little buttons on either side of it do nothing.  Asked the VW
 dealer to check it out while doing other things, and he said it'd just
 have to be replaced - for $251.  I don't think so.  Anyone have a
 cheaper source for new/used ones?  I know I could replace it with a
 stick-on clock for $1.00, but the Carat's still got that new feel (to
 me, anyway) and I'd like to keep it stock for a while.  (It's
 back-lighted, too, which I like.) &gt;&gt;

Have you inserted a ball-point pen tip into the holes to set the clock?
try it.
when I got my '87 there was a K-mart stick-on clock right over the digital
clock, because when the Lazy PO tried to set the clock, he pushed the button
down to hard, and it lodged back behind the plastic, thus the clock would run
on constantly.
Too lazy to take the speedo cluster out and fix it, he stuck the clock right
over it. 
Anyway, I fixed it, took me all of 3 minutes, and now the clock works fine. 

p.s. - I think the dig. clock is the same as in the Cabriolet/Golf / etc,
etc....
