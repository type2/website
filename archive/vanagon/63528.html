well, judging from what i've read here i was fairly lucky, but i picked up
my '85 westy for just under $5K.  everything works wonderfully, the
exception being the a/c.  11,000 on a factory motor.  i love vws, but think
they've become seriously overpriced.  i looked at a '77 not long ago and the
guy kept saying &quot;if i took it out west, i could get double for it&quot;.
anyway...
