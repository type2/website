&gt;&gt; about 20 years ago, the hot set-up for curing all engine ails was

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Spearco made (and maybe still does, i'm out of the loop) a water 
&gt;&gt; injection kit that would inject a mist into the carb throat on 
&gt;&gt; demand, usually triggered by vacuum.  the water injection quantity 
&gt;&gt; and 'turn on' point were adjustable.  the claims by proponents of 
&gt;&gt; this were
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. higher mpg
&gt;&gt; 2. carbon removal
&gt;&gt; 3. cooler running, smoother running
&gt;&gt; 4. reduced detonation
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; maybe this would help you air-cooleds, it seems like a perfect 
&gt;&gt; application.  yes, its dated technology but so are some VW engines.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; does anyone have experience with these set-ups?  are they still being 
&gt;&gt; marketed in speed shops??  i never did buy one of these setup but i 
&gt;&gt; think i kept the literature, i could post it if interested.
&gt;&gt; 

I have 'heard' that water injection is ill-advised for the air-cooled
volkswagen because of the aluminum heads and the possibility of corrosion
within the engine.
