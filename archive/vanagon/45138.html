Give it a rest dude. If you don't like the ride, get off.

We now return you to our regularly scheduled VW programming......

Prodigy Said-
Glad people have noticed my suggestions for improving subject headings,
regarless of whether they have smart mail readers or use their eyes.  Here
are the useless subject nominees for last 150 messages.   Were I the
gestapo in charge of the list, I'd returned them!

First Prize- &quot;Well, Oh ya&quot; -Plenty of replies, useless unless you read
body....(seems to relate to horizonatal engines??????)
2nd: &quot;Approximate Value&quot;  - not enough details
3rd: &quot;Front mat?&quot; please say if for sale, or wanted, yr, in Subject!
4th &quot;Westphalia&quot;  (excused, a newbie)

Others:
&quot;Vellego&quot;  (why not a &quot;Trip&quot; keyword in there?- relates to trip to show?
   Why assume we Easterners know what you're talking about?  It's like us
 saying just &quot;Manassas&quot;.....
&quot;Fuel Pump Removal&quot;- no clue of year until LAST line
&quot;1966 Van For Sale&quot;- No state mentioned
&quot;FS- 1950 bug&quot; - No state or details
&quot;Oil leaks&quot; Year?
PLEASE PLEASE - most postings relate to: (1) for sale= FS in subj , add yr,
mention PARTS if not whole bus., and STATE where found in!
(2) HELP-mention this if wanting advice onfixing something!(yr, what needs
fixing?)
(3) HELP FIND- looking for a part, manual?, bus?, value of something?
(4) TRIP (Like Vellego-( is it a report, a trip getting ready for, a show?)
     Please clarify in subject!
(5) REPORT- somone is narrating their repair, fixup experiences, or
sightings of ususual busses- shorten to REP ?
(6) (F)- already used= funny stuff- mostly on Fri I hear?
(7) REPLY (RE)- put in front of subj. you are replying to!

In the interests of efficiency and unmuddied clarity.......MB in NJ
