I have had mixed experiences with Parts Place as well.  They have trouble
sending precisely what you ask for and it sometimes takes a while, but the
savings are fantastic.  When my bus was broken into in new york, a quick
call to parts place for a new window and installation tips cost be about $25
including the price of the call.  My local mechanic who is REALLY good at
getting inexpensive parts couldn't find me a window for less than $100
installed.  I have also ordered a front bumper and Monza extractor exhaust
from them.  Again prices are dirt cheap ($39 for the bumper and a drop over
$110 for the exhaust) but while I had the bumper in 3 days since I paid by
credit card, the exhaust was shipped COD and I spent literally a week
sitting around the house waiting for Mr. Postman.  So, Yes, order from them
but DO NOT have anything shipped COD!  You waste time and money.

good luck,
nick
