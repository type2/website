The pan you describe is drained by two hoses that go down the side panels
part way.  I couldn't get to them from in the van, but from outside you can

(the black plastic grills).  Inside there you should see a black rubber
hose.  Mine had some piece on the end that plugged up with who knows what,
probably some growth of sorts.  I just removed the piece.  Never leaked
since.
