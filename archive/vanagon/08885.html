Guy at the computer place told me of two VW's for sale:

'56 oval bug.  Shell, needs front fenders, back fenders have been
modified, no deck lid, no glass, 1300cc motor.  Basically its a shell.
$300/offer

'62 double cab pickup, s'posed to be in good shape, 1641cc motor. $1500

I have not seen either of these cars, and I don't really have any
connection to them, although the double cab sounds tempting.

Also, in the &quot;rebuildables&quot; section in the Sac Bee auto section, there is
a '59 double door panel for sale, &quot;project car&quot; $500/offer.  That sounds
interesting, but I don't think I could get away with another dead bus
festering in the yard :(
