Subject: Relabeled Non-VWs

&gt; Does anyone here know about an Isuszu Trooper relabeled as a Volkswagen?
&gt;
&gt; I passed one of these today on I495 (DC Beltway) and suspect it was
&gt; someone with a weird sense of humor.  Looked like the various logos off
&gt; of a vanagon.  Had a VW vinyl cover for the spare tire as well.

I passed an older Buick back in the winter with a VW bus (chrome) logo
wired to the grill. (The Arkansas version of the above story) All I
could think was that a) this yahoo has an old broke-down bus parked in 
the woods somewhere. b) some poor slob is now missing his chrome
emblem. 

BTW, I think it was Clinton's brother driving ;) Joe
