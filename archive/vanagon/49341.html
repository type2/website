&gt;New GM vehicles come with a (claimed) 100k/5yr coolant they call 'Dex-Cool';
&gt;I've just discovered Prestone &quot;Extended Life - 5/100&quot; coolant that notes on
&gt;the bottle that it is Dex-Cool compatable, &amp; silicate and phosphate free.

one thing for everyone to be wary of:  READ THE LABELS CAREFULLY!
those &quot;extended wear&quot; coolants are being advertised as long life, but if you
read the wording carefully, you might find it isn't so. example: texaco has
one that is guaranteed for 150,000 miles. only trouble is, it's for the
big 18-wheelers. guess what? 150,000 miles is about six to eight MONTHS for
them!!!!!  that's 150,000 miles of nearly continous running!! not running
for 30 minutes and sitting for eight hours (i.e., short, stop and go driving).
so be careful. read the labels.

i'm not saying that they are lying, but would you really buy a used car from
those folks??? ;)
