I'm a newbie around here, but I can agree with this.

&gt; I suppose a list prevents alot of SPAM and unwanted junk mail....

Ever hear of a *moderated* news group? It works very much like this but
is a NG.

The one problem I can see is that everyone here had to ask to come in.
You can't even read the list much less respond if you don't pass muster.
But since a ng is so public, the moderator will be swamped with spam
that he'll have to wade through. We won't have the headaches getting
through the mail -- *he* will!
