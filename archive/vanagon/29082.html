Subject: Re: Bolts

&gt;Does anyone have ANY success stories involving an &quot;easy-out&quot; that's actually
&gt;WORKED? Or are these gadgets the mechanical equivalent of Slick-50?

Yes, but... There are a few things you have to keep in mind:
1: You have to attack the problem, not the symptom. The problem is that
   the threads are rusted, welded, etc together. The symptom is that
   the head broke off. You must first to everything you can to free
   the threads.
2. Physician, do no harm. Don't make the problem worse! There are many
   tricks: Left handed drill bits, easy-outs, torches, etc. Each must
   be used so that a larger problem is not created.
3. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Use thread dope
   whenever you put something back together. Some bolts (e.g. manifold
   &amp; water pump) should be removed when the car is new and replaced
   after a liberal coat of dope.
