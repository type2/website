Subject: RE:Roadtrip ends w/ BANG! Clatter..clatter....(+ 2 questions)

The &quot;old geezer&quot; had a wood stove in his bus?  Could this be the answer to
all of my heating problems?  Of course it is probably pretty hard to stoke
it up at 60 mph unless you mount it on the passenger seat.

Now for my questions:

1.  The identification number on my engine indicates that it is an engine
designed for a '76-'79 bus (2L FI).  Is there any way to tell if this is the
exact original engine that came in my '77 Westy?

2.  There is a mystery wire that screws into the head right next to the #3
cylinder FI connection to the head.  It replaces on of the screws that 
regularly holds the cooling tin in place?  It has a single wire coming out of 
it.  What is it?  It appears that there should be one on the other side also
but it is missing.  I may be able to clarify my description of this wire 
somewhat if no one knows what the heck I'm talking about.
