Subject: Rolling Stones again

Remember the story about VW sponsoring the Rolling Stones' tour? Well I just 
read a letter from VAG's head of PR in Autocar magazine in reply to the 
ridicule they printed. He points out that the Rolling Stones owned a '63 VW 
(doesn't say if it was a bus but I doubt they'd have crammed a drum kit in a 
beetle) in which they undertook their first ever tour, and that Keef has 
owned 'five or six' (he probably has trouble counting that high) VW buses 
over the years. Well, well.
