&gt;    So how did it go?   Do you notice a different sound on startup?

It went well. The &quot;diesel like&quot; engine sound at startup is completely gone.
The engine sounds the same now at all times. Runs smooth, accelerates well.
They did a competent job--no residual problems. Wish it were always that
way.
