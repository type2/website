&gt; &gt; Hello all-
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Recently my '86 Westy has developed a problem with the clutch. After I
have been
&gt; &gt; driving in stop-and-go traffic for awhile, the clutch begins to
&quot;chatter&quot; when I
&gt; &gt; try to start from a stop.  The only way I can prevent this from
happening is to
&gt; &gt; rev the motor up to about 3000 rpm while I let the clutch out. Any
ideas on what
&gt; &gt; is causing this, and what needs to be done to fix it?

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt; My 86 GL does the same thing when hot, I've just been living with it but
&gt; would love to hear some ideas about this.
