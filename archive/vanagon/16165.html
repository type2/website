Subject: [WTB] Rocker Panels, 72'...
Date: Sat, 22 Apr 95 19:28:28 EDT

  I am tackling the body of my 72' these next few weeks, and I'm
 wondering if anyone has or knows where I can get rocker panels (inner
 and outer, both sides). Whitney seems like a rip-off (maybe just CAN$
 exchange rate?!), and I don't trust off-shore (maybe someone can
 convince me otherwise!). Its true, this is a shot in the dark, but I
 really want to get rid of all that crusty metal and make my Bus look
 shiney new.
