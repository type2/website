I too thought my starter problem was the ignition switch, when it was
really the starter bushing.

He'll be back, crawling and begging for us to help him.

I'll be he didn't put in that new starter bushing that came with the starter,
the one with the note thats sez if you don't replace the bushing you'll void
the warranty...
