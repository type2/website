Subject: Propane &amp; Bob



Been following the thread Re: propane for a week now.  Don't have
a Westy but do have a 21' Ford powered Weekender.  The main reason
for not using propane for the fridge is that one really doesn't
want an open flame anywhere around when refueling.  It is v. easy
to forget to close the main valve and wait for the gas to burn out
of the lines when you pull into the gas station and fill it up.
Can make for a v. exciting trip!!!

Bob's trip: Okay, we can get him to Dallas, we can get him to 
Buffalo, we may even be able to get him to Venus... But can
we get him from Seattle to Vista?  I would love to give him
a tour of Eastern Oregon, but it _is_ a little out of his way...
