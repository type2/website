Subject: Re: FS:  '89 Westy at 200% profit!!!

Yes folks, looks like another great Ron Salmon deal for us grateful list
folks.  I'd just like to remind you all that 2 or 3 weeks ago we were
notified about a similar (then bargain) Westy FS, then warned off it once
the details became known!!  Remember that now?  It was the salvage titled
Florida saltwater flood rightoff, flooded above the floor, hence above
engine and trans.  If the current seller, Mr Salmon, has anything he'd care
to add to this let's hear it.  Maybe it's not the same vehicle? (hah!).
Watch it folks, on top of a very inflated price (check Edmonds) it's a very
suspect vehicle.  Those of you who think I'm trampling on the sacred toes of
'a regular business deal' can just PO on this one!  Let the flames begin!!!
Tim, (highly steamed again)
