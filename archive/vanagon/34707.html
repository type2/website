&gt; &gt; I was looking for an MV Weekender when I bought my GL.  VW's 800 number was
&gt; &gt; great at locating all the new EVs in the US.  Took them about a week to do
&gt; &gt; it.  Turned out that there were only 2 MV weekenders left, in Hawaii, and
&gt; &gt; they were both automatics, so I bought the GL.
&gt;
&gt; No MV non-weekenders?

Not when I was looking.  Only one they found within the LA basin was my GL.
Others were available in surrounding areas, but all were automatics.

&gt; The camper is based on an extended length EV/T4, could that help explain
&gt; it?  Extra reinforcements on the bottom to allow the roof to be cut open?

I guess, but 6K above a standard-length van???


&gt; Thought it was protectionist tariffs and laws...

I suppose it is, but then I've managed to avoid driving one for 27 years...
