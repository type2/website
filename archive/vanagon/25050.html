So snuggles_at_vnet.ibm_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; b) the gas milage was awful. when i left raleigh for the coast, i had between
&gt; 3/4 and a full tank...when i got back to raleigh...after about 120-150 miles--
&gt; i didn't keep a record like i shoulda...i was on empty just about. and i went
&gt; 60mph almost the whole way. the milage to greensboro was better, i filled up
&gt; the tank and only used a 3/4 of it on the trip...with alot of in town driving.
&gt; so what would cause me to be getting bad gas mileage. could it be the problem
&gt; in a) above? there are no leaks in the fuel lines. i really hope this can be
&gt; corrected.......or a 6 hour trip will cost me like $48 in gas!!! i'm estimated
&gt; that on the highway i had like 15mpg from raleigh to greensboro. i won't
&gt; know for sure until i fill up the tank again and keep an accurate record.

Hint: Don't trust the gas gauge.  They are notoriously inaccurate.  Record
your odometer miles at the next fill-up and at the next fill-up.  Do the 
math to get the average MPG and then and only then will you know if you 
got good/ okay/bad mileage.
