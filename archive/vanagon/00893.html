&gt; &gt; I accidently dissconnected the vacuum hose from my EGR valve on my 76 van.
&gt; &gt; I looked, but I couldn't find where the other end goes!  Somewher near the
&gt; &gt; intake air manifold/distributor, I think.  Regardless, my EGR has been
&gt; &gt; disconnected from the exhaust for years, it's just that I am losing vacuum.
&gt; &gt; I can even hear the air his when I run the engine.

Well, I couldn't locate it worth a darn.  Proabably has something to do with my
loud Manza muffler.  Anyway, I found what felt like a vacuum hose fitting right
under and forward of the #3 cylinder branch from the air intake distributor.
It's this protruding thing next to this other protruding thing with a screw in
it.  (I clearly don't what the hell anything is!)  But it still hisses.
Can anyone help?

Thanks again-
