Subject: Re: me again: 4x4 diesel campers



&gt;
&gt;well ... i had never thought of it, but why not? surely the fire departments
&gt;in germany have to have diesel buses, and surely they need 4x4, too.

snip, snip
&gt;
&gt;now, as to getting one over here ... i think you'd have to create it yourself.
&gt;but the syncro 4x4 has basically the same transmission as the 2-wheel drive
&gt;vanagon (well, it matches up to the same engine, anyway. that helps). the
&gt;boy, can you imagine the torque and grunt that thing would have! :) i'm
&gt;with Ralph Nader and my government trying to protect me from myself, i doubt
&gt;that there are any sort of these over here. but then again, you'd think with
&gt;as many nuts in the world as there are, at least ONE would have made it over
&gt;here. :)

gee joel, i don't think that the stock 81-83 diesel could push a synchro
very well - turbocharged? maybe a bit better (48 -&gt; 73 hp, + increase in
torque). Here in victoria, there are 2 porsche engined synchros, one
camper, one passenger. They sound wonderful, i mean the noise they make
when they scream away. The westy has 15&quot; wheels + big tires, an australian
type bush bar and windshield protector plus a hideous big square air-
conditioner unit up on the luggage rack. The owner travelled in australia
with it (the local folklore has it that it caught fire there, he shipped 
it back to canada for repair!). The trans is stock - consequently under-
geared (one reason for the large wheels).
The passenger model has lower-than-stock profile tires, metallic gold
and very pretty and it really goes. I bet both of them could make
extra money in the winter as snowploughs.
Maybe in germany the diesel synchros were equipped with a larger engine,
god only knows why vw put such a pokey one in the N.A. models.
