Subject: Front Floor Mats--WhereToBuy?
Date: Wed, 11 Jan 95 9:48:53 PST

So DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; My front mats in my Vanagon, the two mats that go on either side under the
&gt; driver and front passenger's seats, are worn. I remember that I bought them
&gt; at the dealer. Does anybody have a line on the best place to go to buy new
&gt; ones? Mine have nice little VW logos on them.
&gt; 

Well I still see mats at the dealer and occasionally look them over.

Umm... along this vein, I'd like to know if anyone out there knows
if there's a good product out there to cover the front walk-thru
area and the stick-shift area with some kind of material that will
protect the carpet.  I'd like to get something down before it gets
too worn.

Thanks,

Steven
