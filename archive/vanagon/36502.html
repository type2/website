Subject: RE: high energy ignitions

I talked with Ed Ted or Jed something at Compufire about the 
 suitability of using there product with a  fuel injected bus. His 
 thought s were along the same lines as mine- the FI brain needs a 0 
 voltage condition (brought about by the points closing) to properly 
 and reliably work and any electronic point replacement never drops the 
 volts all the way. He also mentioned that there was a problem with the 
 &quot;idle stabilizer circuit&quot; and electronic points, and the bus would 
 have a strange or erratic idle.  I was wondering if VW changed 
 something with the FI when they went to the Hall effect sensor? Or 
 perhaps they run some kind of parallel circuit that gives a 0 voltage 
 condition.  I am thinking about digging my old Jacobs ignition system 
 out of the cupboard and hooking it up and maintaining the points for 
 reliability sakes and avoiding the point replacement scheme.
