&gt;  Ok Weston, it's interesting to learn about the oil leak, but it would 
&gt;be even more interesting to learn about the &quot;wonders&quot; it worked.  While 
&gt;the experience is still fresh in your mind, how about describing the 
&gt;differences in temperature you observed in what running conditions.  Also 
&gt;please mention what temperature gauge(s) you have and the physical 
&gt;characteristics of the radiator.
&gt;
&gt;
Be happy to. Recall that this is an 81 Westy with an auto and just rebuilt
top end.

My usual conditions are about 210* or so when just tooling around in the 35
to 45mph range. I have a 25 mile course around the Atlanta highways that I
run this thing on when I'm checking temps. At the end of a hot day and at 55
to 60 mph I can expect the oil temps to quickly average 230 to 240* and then
250* if I coast after reaching those temps. Standing after coming off the
highway is hopeless; it won't budge off 250*. I've got VDO oil pressure and
temp gauges with the temp sensor located in the sump at the lower corner of
the motor. supposedly that's a cool spot. I've been using single wt 40 oil
recently. At temps of roughly 230*, the pressure drops below 10 and sets off
the idiot light. Thats a constant at idle; no problem at temps under that.
Generally at highway speeds the pressure is about 30.

The cooler was a 48 plate model from JCW with dimensions of 11x5 3/4x1 1/2.
It fit in the left corner behind the taillightand cocked at an angle. Air
flow probably was around it more than through it. Twin hoses ran through
holes cut in the tin to a sanwich adapter at the oil filter. I tried this
last friday evening over my usual course. My impression around town was that
it did a much better job of holding the temps in the 190 to 200 range. Once
on the highway, I was able to do 60 or better and hold it to the 210 to 220
area. What seemed to be really different was the ability to push it harder
and see the temp climb only to fall again once I lightened up a bit. My
feeling all along has been that heat seems to have a cumulative buildup that
just overwhelms the cooling ability. I was happy as a clam with the cooler
add-on until I exited and had to idle for a protracted period. Once again the
temps climbed up into the 240 range after that high speed run. I resolved not
to sit in traffic anymore.

Now, today I spent an hour on the phone with Fred at Dee
Engineering(Bugpack?) and we crafted a replacement. Among other things, Fred
has apparently stuffed some corvair motors into buses for 100+mph fun.
Essentially we are going to use the same cooler in a larger version, 72
plate, and remote the filter into the the engine compartment. That somehow
addresses his concern that the sandwich adapter tends to drape the oil lines
over the heater box. Interestingly, they spec smaller brass bayonet fittings
than JCW provided in their install kit which I think was the root of the leak
probem. When initially ordering from JCW, I talked at length to their &quot;tech&quot;
department about the discrepancy in the indicated sizes and the respnse
basically was that they wouldn't sell the kit if it weren't correct. Now I've
got to go back to Nopi locally and try to translate the order to them; Dee
doesn't deal with people, only dealers.

Hope this fills in the gaps. Comments are welcome.

BTW, why in the world can't people in Oregon pump their own gas?
