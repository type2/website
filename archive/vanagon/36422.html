Subject: EV Sgl &amp; Dbl cabs

&gt;My only major complaint about the EV is that VWUS screwed up in its
&gt;marketing effort, or lack thereof for the EV. There are TONS of T4s in
&gt;Europe....the line there includes single cab, double cab pick up
&gt;trucks, delivery vans, passenger vans, etc...4 cyl, 5 cyl gas...4 &amp; 5
&gt;cylinder diesels (some now with turbos)....from what I saw over there
&gt;they are bullet proof workhorses.

I've seen several sgl &amp; dbl cab EV pickups around here lately, so I 
guess a few are making to Canada... Nice looking truck.

Shawn.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
