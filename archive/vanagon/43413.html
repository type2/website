&gt;        Were the stock rims painted silver to match the silver of
&gt;the full size wheel covers?

Hello Gary
     The rims on my '86 vanagon are black with the silver wheel covers.  I
have seen silver rims on vanagons in the salvage yard.  It may depend on the
body color.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
