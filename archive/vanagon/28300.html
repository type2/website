&gt; OK, I'm with you Cap'n Kirk.  50, but still like to look.  Gotta be careful
&gt; my wife doesn't catch me ogling the live girls, but I notice she still
&gt; likes the looks, and I still enjoy lookin' at her still quite fine
&gt; physique.

Hey Bob. Good answer. Mine doesn't seem to mind when I look at her 
either. She even points good ones out to me!
