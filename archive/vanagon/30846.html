Subject: Sad story, from long ago....

Hello All,

Up here in the northeast it's rare finding fellow busers.  Usually, I get
people tellin' me about their family owning one just like mine.  A fellow-
colleage relayed this story to me:

	The family bus ('66 or '67) needed brake werk done.  They dropped 
it off to a local garage here in cambridge (back in the 70's) to get the 
job done.  When the dad came to pick it up it was nowhere on the lot. 
Inquiring as to where the vehicle was, the mechanic said &quot;You mean that old
green van?&quot;  I thought that was supposed to be crushed!

Ouch.
