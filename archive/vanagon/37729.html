Hey all,
'78 bus with A/C.

I was tooling down the road today using the fan on my A/C (but not using
the A/C itself) and all of a sudden I hear this weird noise.  I turn it
off, turn it back on and it stops for a while but then starts again.
The motor, however, still sounds normal.  The strange noise changes with
the speed of the fan.  It sounds like the fan blades are striking
something somewhat soft as they turn.  I'm wondering if a piece of
insulation or foam has come loose and is smacking the fan blades.  I'd
like to get inside there and see what the deal is.  Is there an easy
way?  My A/C is manufactured by Cool VW Products, Inc.  

Thanks for any help,
Sean
