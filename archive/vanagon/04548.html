&gt; Check the antenna cable/antenna connection, or perhaps try replacing the 
&gt; antenna and cable.  This definitely sounds like a poor antenna connection 
&gt; to me.  Also, some radios (typically older ones) have an antenna trimmer 
&gt; adjustment that tunes the radio to the antenna.  Look for a slotted screw 
&gt; type adjustment - probably labelled ANT.  Adjust while listening to a 
&gt; weak station.  Otherwise it's probably new radio time.

Wes: Thanks for the reply: I checked the connection on the antenna b y
removing and cleaning it. Its
the standard Vanagon vertical antenna coming from the drivers side. The
connection itself (both ends) is solid and the antenna itself is clean.
The trimmer (pot) has also been adjusted for maximum gain. Since the noise
exists even when the engine is not running, I have ruled out (perhaps
incorrectly) engine/electrical intereference - it is not the typical
whining sound one hears in these situations.
I had hoped someone might say oh yes this is your xyz and will cost zyx to
replace. My key concern is to fix it rather than replace the radio (I like
the Alpine setup and assume its expensive to replace). BTW does the fact
that the radio is not hooked up to the ignition have anything to do with the
problem - it seems the VWs don't have an accessory position for  the key
so the radio can be run even with the ign. off.

Thanks - DC
