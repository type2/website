&gt; This new engine is now burning oil at the rate of at least 1 quart per 1000
&gt; miles.  In the last 400 miles it burned 3/4 quart.  Nick Fernandez at Golden
&gt; Gate VW maintains that this is &quot;normal&quot;.  I don't agree with Nick.

I don't either.  I don't know how many miles your engine has on it, but
I've heard it's normal for engines to use some ouil &quot;until the rings
seat&quot;.  I just installed a rebuilt engine in my bus, and although I
don't have any data for the first 300 miles (cause I changed the oil
then) I haven't had to add a drop since.  It just passed the 4100 mile
mark, and is running on Castrol 10W30 dino oil.  What kind of oil are
you using?  Did you follow a break-in procedure?  How is engine
compression?  Is there noticable blowby?  Are there large amounts of air 
exiting the dipstick tube or breather box?
