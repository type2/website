Subject: Vanagon list archives at Automatrix split as well...


Following Gerry Skerbitz's and Ken Hooper's lead, I split the hypermail
archive of v_at_l into two archives, one for each mailing list.  They are at

	http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/type2/
	http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/

The advantages to the split as I see it are:

	1. The independent archives should grow somewhat slower and
	therefore need to be rolled over less frequently (lower maintenance
	overhead for me).

	2. The archives will mirror the content of the two lists instead of
	mixing them together.  (I realize this isn't necessarily a point
	in favor of the split for some folks.)  I believe this will result
	in less confusion down the road.

	3. The indexes for the two separate lists should typically be
	smaller, so people who have had trouble downloading large HTML
	indexes should have fewer problems.

If you have any questions please direct them to me (skip_at_calendar_dot_com).  I
no longer read the bus lists - having sold my Vanagon over a year ago - so I
won't see things you post to them.

I enjoy being able to offer the Van web site and the mailing list archive,
and hope others find them useful.  I plan to continue doing so for the
forseeable future, though I hope people understand it is definitely a
sideline activity.  Maybe someday I'll get some free time again.  I don't
have the space, time or money to work on my TR-250 at the moment, let alone
the gall to add to another car to the mix...
