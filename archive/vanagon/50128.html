&lt;&lt; Howdy All,
         I've got a coolant leak that only occurs when I use the
 heater/defroster. The general area of the leak is front passenger side. I
 crawled underneath with a flashlight but couldn't find the leak source. I
 assume the leak originates at the heater core or its hose connections. So
 what is the best way to get up in there? Do you need to remove the dash?
         Any info is appreciated (my Bentley is en route)
  &gt;&gt;


You have two choices.  Remove the dash and dissasemble the heater housing or
remove only the glove box and cut the side of the heater housing.  this will
allow you to change the core.  You will have to glue the sid eof the hosing
back in place if you choose the easy route.  I had a heater core repalced a
number of years ago by the dealer,(goodwill warranty).  They used the quick
and dierty route.
