Subject: 86 Syncro Gift--Thanks Dan &amp; Barb &amp; the list!!!

Hi All,

&lt;brag mode off&gt;
This is a *thank you* to the Vanagon list and Dan &amp; Barb Beatty, but I
don't want to make it seem like a bragfest...

I would like to humbly thank Barb &amp; Dan most graciously for passing over
their gift of an 86 Syncro needing attention into my possession.  In turn,
I have found a home for my spare 2.1 motor and now have a Champagne Silver 
Syncro like I was originally looking for.  {see below for original post}
Plus Dan &amp; Barb only live a few miles from me and I got to meet them!
Small world indeed.  The gift Syncro used to live about 4 blocks away from
my house.  I did not figure it would ever be available, let alone a gift!

I plan on rebuilding the gift Syncro to the point where I can then sell my 
Blue 86 Syncro.  How long this will take, I dunno.  Thanks again Barb &amp; Dan 
and a *Big* thanks to the Vanagon list!!  8-)  8-)  8-)

&gt;Subject: 86 Syncro
&gt;
&gt;This weekend we received a &quot;gift&quot; of a 86 syncro. Reportedly the engine
is
&gt;&quot;blown&quot;. We looked at it and the body has several small to moderate
dents,
&gt;a small amout of seam rust and the center bench is missing. Other than
&gt;that all seems to work.
