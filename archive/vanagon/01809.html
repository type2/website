Subject: Bug's eye view


There seems to be an unusually high percentage of Python fans among Vanagon
owners. Perhaps we should add this to the database...

I think that it would be most appropriate for the Vanagon add to run with a
Norwegian Blue Parrot. i.e., &quot;If you hadn't nailed it to the hood...&quot;  or
Whump! &quot;Norwegian Blues stun easily....&quot;

BTW: Funny you should mention it, Joel, but I am going on vacation... I want
to see how many cans of Spam will fit in a Westie &lt;g&gt;
