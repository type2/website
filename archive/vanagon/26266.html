&gt;Chrysler the FIRST with double sliding doors...yep, just like OJ
&gt;is innocent...
&gt;
&gt;I recall in a VW Transporter brochure I have hanging around here
&gt;somewhere that in 1971 (the date of this brochure), one could
&gt;order a Type 2 with sliding doors on BOTH sides...
&gt;
&gt;And if one wants to go back to &quot;hinged door technology&quot;, we
