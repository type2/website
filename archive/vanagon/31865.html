Subject: '87 Vanagon Mystery: Hard to start
Date: Wed, 3 Jan 1996 16:15:33 -0800

Hi Kids,

It's been a real long time since I've contributed to the list.  Work has 
reduced me to one of those &quot;snivelling lurkers&quot; that Joel affectionately 
refers to every week.

Anyway my neighbor stops by yesterday and he's got a gen-u-ine boni-fied 
Vanagon mystery on his hands. Here's the deal:

1.  We're dealing with a plain jane '87 Vanagon (ok, it's blue if you want 
to know).
2.  The van won't start most (but not all) of the time.  It turns over 
fine, and really WANTS to catch, but it won't.
3.  The problem occurs when the motor is cold or hot.
4.  Usually he'll crank it for a few minutes, give up, and come back in 15 
minutes to try again, only for the van to fire up instantly!

We did a collective head-scratching yesterday, but couldn't figure it out. 
 Plus, I don't have any manuals for wasserboxers. Does this beast have CIS 
fuel injection?

Anyone wanna take a stab at it?

TIA,
Erik
