Subject:      unknown buses - i'm after you again! :)

&lt;don't worry about the '103' stuff ... it's an old kludge in the program. :)&gt;

so ... now that you all know that i don't know what kind/model/etc bus you
have, i'd appreciate it if any of you would care to tell me ... so i can
include it in the stats. if you don't have a bus, but want to get one in the
future, that qualifies you to change status from Unknown to Wanabus. :)  but
you gotta let me know. if you'd rather me keep my big nose out of your
business, and you'd rather just sit and lurk, that's ok, too. i'm just a
compulsive data collector/pimp, trying to do his job. :)
