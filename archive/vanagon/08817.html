Subject: Re:  Trouble after rebuild

Thanks for all the responses to my plight.

Today I gained a new appreciation for you folks who live in northern climes.  
I waited until midday for some of the snow to melt, went out and pushed the 
bus so the bare spot was toward the rear, laid down my ground cloths, and 
went to work.  All the time I was out there, ice was falling out of the trees 
onto me and the temp was about 40.

Yep, the valves were real tight.  I did the right side, and then had to come 
in and warm my fingers by the fire before finishing the left.  The power was 
out today so I had no heat otherwise.

I removed a shim from the generator pulley to tighten up the loose belt, and 
then fired it up.  The idle seems better now, but the bad noise is still there.
At very low speeds, it sounds like grinding or scraping.  At higher rpms, it 
goes from a thunk-thunk noise to a growl.  I hear it at all speeds except the 
very fastest.  It is most pronounced when the engine is accelerating.  The 
green light is out at all speeds, although I do not have a pressure gauge.

I'm going to head out tomorrow and try to make it the 35 miles home.  I'll then
take it over to the machine shop and let them listen to it.  But I sense 
another teardown coming :-(

Has anyone else experienced these noises on their 1600?  Any idea what the
bad news is?
