Subject: RE: Vanagon paintjob

&gt;Does anybody know who makes VW's later model clearcoat/basecot paints and
&gt;where to buy these paints aftermarket?

&gt;Somehow I remember someone speculating that these are actually BASF paints.

VWs in AUS (at least 1968 through to 1980) were painted with Dulon type 'E'
acrylic laquer.  Dulon is the Automative Branch of Dulux.
