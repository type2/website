Subject: Brakes, one-piece hub/drum


Dear fellow list-members:

I ventured into the world of the 1970 Transporter brakes this weekend, 
and have a few questions to put to all.  

Drums:  	The standard diameter for front, per Bentley, is 250mm, with a 
service limit of 251.5mm.  Well, mine are pushing the service limit and 
have some minor grooving.  The questions:

1)	Is it possible to obtain new drums (front, in particular)?
2)	Is it possible to have my drums &quot;relined?&quot;

Thanks!
