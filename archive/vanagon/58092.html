Subject: LOW POWER 84GL

I have AN 84 GL (automatic).  For about a year I have struggled with a low
power/poor milage
problem.  Compression checks out on all cyl.  Power is good unti the engine
warms up.   After reaching operating temperature it is a dog and I get about
16 miles to the gallen on the hwy.  I might think this is normal except for
the fact that I have an 83 that is identical except for the xmision (4spd
manual).  It seems to have plenty of power and averges from 22-24 miles per
gal.  I have swapped out every component in the fuel and ignition system
including fuel rails.  The only thing I haven't changed is the wiring harness
itself.  This includes different computer, ignition module, injectors,
flapper box and fuel regulator. I have also changed the temperature sensor #1
that is next to the temperature sender near water pump.

I also get the mysterious and famous occasional miss/ cut-out that occures
infrequently and is corrected by shutting the engine off and starting up
again.  I haven't purchased the reccomened harness that is suppose to fix
this but I don't think this is unrelated to the fuel consumption and power
problem.

Any ideas would be appreciated?
