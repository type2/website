Rachel,

I'm in South Dartmouth...not to far away from New Beige...

Buy the best tools you can. If necessary, buy them one at a time.
Start off with wrenches (open end, socket set, etc.), screwdrivers
etc. I'd strongly recommend Craftsman tools from Sears. If they
break..they give you new ones. Don't buy cheap tools...you will
find they break easily, the sockets round off, and generally
make doing the work more frustrating than not.

If I were you I would borrow certain tools that you don't need
that often, like compression testers, meters, etc. I could
let you borrow them once in a while. 

As far as any school in the area that does classes, unless you
are looking to take the &quot;generic&quot; mechanic training stuff,
at NBVHS, there is nothing around that I know of.

What you should do is take the idiot book and start off with
something simple, say changing the oil. Then move up to 
changing the plugs...etc...etc. Let each new experience
build upon the previous. The idiot book is really
good this way.

If you have any questions, etc. , e-mail me.

Ric
