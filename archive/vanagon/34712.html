&gt;The carbon canister *looks* like a pretty unimportant appendage in the

&gt;
&gt;Perhaps this should change. What have others done about it? Should the
&gt;canister be replaced, or just its contents?
&gt;

Believe it or not, many manufacturers list this as a 30,000 mi service item
 It is not refillable.  I would leave it be unless it leaks.
