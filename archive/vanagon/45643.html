Subject: Re: HELP! '64 ignition shot?

I remember this from when I had a '63, '65 and my friends '67.  I put fuse
blocks in before the light switch, and the windsheild wipers, with 30A
fuses.  The only time they blew was when we, heh, shorted the wires while
working on the wiring.  Just what the fuse was installed for.
