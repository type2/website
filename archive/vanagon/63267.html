Tony -

Yes, I did this a couple of months ago on my 84 Westy and have about 3100
on the engine so far.  I used the existing Digijet instead of carrying
over the Digifant with no apparent problems surfacing.  I don't expect
any as I have had several overseas customers with 86's and 87's using
Digijet/2.1 (factory apparently) purchasing ECU's and other stuff they've
needed for their vans.

I recently privately posted a 3 part procedure on how to do it to
someone, but not to the list en mass, based on my experiences.  If you'd
like a copy, p-mail me and I will be happy to forward it to you.

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I'll be getting the '85 Westy from Lon Herman today to begin resto. I
&gt;have
&gt;a line on a 2.1L and was curious if it would work with the '85's auto
&gt;tranny. Any other differences I should be aware of? I know the 2.1L
&gt;uses
&gt;the Digifant FI (way to familiar with that set-up!) and I believe the
&gt;'85
&gt;used a Digijet like on my old '83.5. I'm assuming I would just carry
&gt;all
&gt;the Digifant stuff over to the '85? Any other details. Didn't Jim at
&gt;Sherwood recently do all this? Guess I should have been reading all
&gt;the
&gt;posts :-)
&gt;
&gt;I know everyone has been talking of the Subaru/Kennedy conversions of
&gt;late,
&gt;but I don't think I can afford that. Unless it could all be done for
&gt;around
&gt;a grand.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to eveyone who has inquired about the '86 currently for sale,
&gt;guess
&gt;I need to post a price.

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;   I am interested in installing a Weekender-style pull out bed.
&gt;Is
&gt;this
&gt;&gt;  possible (the van is a 84) ?  Are the fittings the same for the
&gt;normal
&gt;seat
&gt;&gt;  and the puul-out seat ?  Has anyone done this ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;      The rear bumper is missing, and I was quoted &gt; $800 for a new
&gt;one.
&gt;Will
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;  have trouble finding a good bumper at the junk yard, and how
&gt;involved is
&gt;it
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;  replace this ? &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; yes, you can put a weekender interior into a pre 85 van (BTDT, and
&gt;BTW
&gt;I've
&gt;&gt; got 2 weekender interiors for sale.. anyone interested?)
&gt;&gt; and as far as the 800 for a back bumper..... YEAH, RIGHT!!!
&gt;whoever
&gt;told
&gt;&gt; you that was really yankin your chain....
&gt;&gt; You can get NEW ones for about 100......
