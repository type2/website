Subject: Alloy Wheels - again!

Not to rehash all the previous discussion - I would like to ask for input on
a particular wheel-tire combo for a final decision on my part.

I am about to upgrade from standard steel wheels to Alloys on my &quot;new&quot; '91
Westy (non-syncro :()

Option 1:

Factory Alloys from the dealer
Tires required: 205/70 HR14s:
--either
Michelin MXV4 radials : H 95 rated (130 miles/hr _at_ 1521 lbs/wheel; Max psi 44)
300 wear rated (60,000 mi/2)
--or
Pirelle P4000 : H 93 rated (130 miles/hr _at_ 1433 lbs/wheel; Max psi 44)
50,000 mi warrenty
 
Option 2:

Borbet Leichtmetallrader Alloys (Mercedes wheels) from the TireRack
--They say this wheel is an exact crossover for the '91 VW Vanagon
--but they are 15&quot; wheels: 15 X 7
--these alloys look exactly like the VW wheel, escept there are 8 rather than 5
&quot;cut outs&quot;

Tires required: 205/65 HR15s
Michelin Energy MXV4 radials : H 94 rated (130 miles/hr _at_ 1477 lbs/wheel; 
Max psi 44) 340 wear rated (68,000 mi/2)

QUESTIONS:

Are they correct in saying that the Borbet wheels are &quot;correct&quot; for the VW
Vanagon/Westy? As they are 15&quot; wheels, they do require a larger tire.

205/70 R14 tires measure 25.3 inches
vs.
205/65 R15 tires measure 25.5 inches

If the Borbet wheels are appropriate, and will cause no problems - would you
go this route?

New factory Alloys are $425 list/$300 if you're lucky
Borbet Alloys are $125/115 each from the TireRack - and look almost like the
VW Wheels.

I would like to save money - but not at the cost of safety or mechanical 
problems.

Thankx-
	Kenyon
