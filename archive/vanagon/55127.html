Subject: (Fwd) Delivery failure

&gt; I was just wondering what grade of oil everyone puts in their VW's.  I 
&gt; have a 1980 Camper, and was wondering which grade(OR Brand) is the best.  
&gt; I've checked out the chart in the back of my VW manual, and it shows the 
&gt; best grades for different weather conditions.  Though I wanted to get the 
&gt; advice of other Vanagon owner's.

I've used 20w50 year round in all my VWs over the years, usually 
Castrol, Pennzoil, Valvoline (in that order, but whatever's on sale). 
I also buy VW filters by the case at the dealer and get them for $6-7 
CDN each. Fram costs around $5 here, so I'd rather have the peace of 
mind for the extra buck. Unless it gets below -15C you can leave 
20w50 in all year. 
I now run 15w50 Mobil synthetic in my '88 Westy, mainly to help 
hydraulic lifter noise (which it has), and also since it has to work 
pretty hard and I'd like it to last as long as possible. Since I 
change oil in my Jetta every 6-8 weeks (5000km) I figure I'm safe 
with regular oil.
If you don't mind the extra cost, synthetic is a great choice year 
round also - much easier cranking when cold, even with 15w50.
If you *have* to go below 20w50, try 15w40, or use synthetic. I've 
had trouble in several VWs with 10w30 not holding oil pressure well, 
even with the VW filter.
