Subject: Does the POP mean anything? (steering box revisited)

I believe Martin Sage had this problem once, regarding a &quot;popping&quot; sound
when he turned his steering wheel.  Mine seems to be coming from the
steering box, and only when I turn it a bit to the right from dead center.
It seems as though the gears don't want the wheels to turn or something.
As far as driving the bus, the steering is fine--problem only happens when
she's parked.

Any comments or suggestions?  Please e-mail me directly at johnny89_at_io_dot_com
as I am no longer subscribed to this list (temporarily).

Regards,

Johnny
