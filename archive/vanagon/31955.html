Subject: Click &amp; Clack

Here's a funny story...

I was driving up to Hoch Motors in Santa Rosa, California.  They specialize
in reselling Vanagons, and I wanted to see what they had on their lot.

On the way up to Santa Rosa, Click &amp; Clack came on, and I got the feeling
that they would talk about VW busses.  I thought to myself that I would pay
special attention to whatever they had to say on the subject.

Well, about a half-hour later a woman came on and said that she drove a
Vanagon Westie.  They said wonderful things about it, including that it made
anyone look cool to be driving one.

So I got my van :-)
