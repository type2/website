Subject: re- colors, and such...

&gt;will AAA give me a discount if I paint my type II in some PPG fluorescent,
&gt;day-glo color (assuming the paint exists)?

They exist, but they fade quickly.  I tried the orange over the Rustoleum
&quot;Allis Chalmers Safety Orange&quot; that went on the nose and body bulge of The
Bozobus.

There is a steel recycling company based in Houston that has the tops of
their tractor units painted fluorescent orange, but I suspect that they
must repaint these frequently.
