Subject: Re: Frozen manual trans

There is no dip stick for manual trans. There is a check hole near the top of
the trans housing on the passenger side. You have to unscrew the screw, then
put your finger into the hole. If you can feel oil, then there is enough. If
not, top it up (thru the same hole) with gear oil (80W90 or better yet use
synthetic 75W90 oil).
Regarding the hard ti shift in cold problem, I recommand you to try the
synthetic gear oil. It works for me.

Good luck.
