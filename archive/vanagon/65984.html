Subject:      VWAG vehicle Info address??

Hey Vanagon Buddies! Would one of you guys have the address where you
can write to VWAG to find out whatever manufacturing info they might
have? Im really curious to find out if my Carat was built on my
birthday(day not year!), it's made in October so it might!  1 out of
30 chance! hah! I do know the registration was Oct 16th, right on my
bday! But, i dont have to worry about that for a year!

I done this with my 71 kombi i had and found out which numbers are
which in the VIN, the color wasn't registered though! That bus was
Chianti Red I know that much.

if anyone has the address, i'd appreciate it!
