I have also hadd a time when the back of the door would bind when
opening, but I could not diagnose the problem. Until I tried
to fix some other stuff and I discovered that I was missing some
of the bolts that hold it on! They get loose (all that banging open
and closed) and fall out. You cant really tell because the door
is so heavy that it just sits out of kilter. Look for missing
bolts (dashboard mounting screws are the same) by trying to 
lift the rear of the door. 

I have tightened mine, even tried loctite, but they still 
come loose every couple of years and need to be tightened.

Also try wheel bearing grease in the upper, middle, and lower
track. It will collect dust in the lower track, but
workslonger than WD-40. Mabye just WD-40 in the lower track.
