Subject: Re:  Techron Saved My Tush (Was:Bus Bummed By Bad Gas)

I've used it on my '86, but the results were not so dramatic.  It SEEMED
to run better, but that's just because it cost me $.

I've had much the same experience lately - (See posting, New Digifant Bogon)
intermittant missing, bucking etc.

Chalked it up to something electrical, rather than fuel.  After poking 
around the FI system for about a week, it went away.  (I HATE that ...)
I'm now wondering if it was fuel.  I didn't add anything like techron,
but I ran two tankfuls of 93 octane name-brand gas thru it.  
(The octane won't help - but the additive package in the premium stuff
is rumoured to be better)

The question is, what is happening to the system that would cause the
bucking, then get fixed by the additive?  If it's mucked up injectors,
you would think it would run consistantly lousy.  Or are we seeing the
computer (badly) reacting to gummed up injectors?
 
 &gt;Anybody out there run Techron regularly through their Digifant or Digijet FI?
 &gt;It saved my butt this weekend.
