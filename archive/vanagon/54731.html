Subject: Shifting, No Clutch
From: &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

A little while ago, my clutch slave cylinder failed and due to the 
location and the time (Washington DC at 1 am) I decided to take a 
carefully planned route to a safe haven, cranking over in second and 
actually making it there without having to stop (or shift).  I 
mentioned this to some people I work with and a few mentioned they 
&quot;knew people&quot; (don't they always?) who shifted their manual trannys 
without using the clutch just by cranking over in gear and just jamming 
the lever in for the upshifts.  I putted along in second at about 25-30 
mph, but some sections it would have been nice to have had third gear.  
I realize it is not exactly safe to do this, but it was a personal 
decision based on real world circumstances (14 hour night shift, 1 am 
in South DC, no other way home, etc). 

Question-Does anyone have personal experience or can advise of the 
damage, if any, that may be incurred by shifting without using the 
clutch?  This is the second time in my life I have had to limp home 
without a clutch (first was with an old Mustang).  

And to concur with what an earlier listmember posted, the slave 
cylinder failed 200 miles after the master cylinder failed (luckily in 
my driveway). Probably would have replaced both had I known it happens 
in pairs, the slave was pretty easy to replace. 

Thanks,
