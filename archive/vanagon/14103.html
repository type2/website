Howdy, all!


Well now, I finally got things put back together OK,
and my Bus is running strong again!

I ended up just replacing the main, rod, and cam
bearings, and the pushrods.  Oil pressure is 60psi
cold, and never gets below 20psi at idle when warm.
So far, the oil temp has never got above 180 degrees.
(only 20 miles or so total).  The engine runs great,
and feels strong.

*However*...

It's still making a hell of a racket, the same noise
that prompted me to take it apart in the first place!
I am now speculating that the noise is the pistons
slapping the sides of the cylinders.  I used the 
same pistons/cylinders; I didn't see a lot of wear,
but did see some small scratches along the cylinder
wall, and on the pistons below the rings (I couldn't
feel them with my fingernail), like something was
circulated through the oil at some point.  Anyway,
I'm thinking that maybe during the drive up from 
Phoenix, when the oil temp got almost to 250 degrees
at one point, the piston skirt(s) collapsed (I
didn't check for that before reassembling :-o).
If so, would this cause a whole bunch 'o noise?
How many miles would I expect out of these pistons
if this is what happened? (more than 1042, I hope!)


Grateful for any insite!
