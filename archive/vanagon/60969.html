Subject: Syncro Air Filters &amp;86&gt; Air flow meters FS!

Listees,

  I still have a few of the Syncro Style Air Filters for sale, $20.00 Each!  This is 
normally a $80.00 filter IF you can find it!

  I too have the 86 and up air flow meters still, Not many but they're $175.00 while 
they last!

  Another item I have is the Bosch 3-Wire o2 senser that you solider your plug onto 
for $65.00, Normally in the $119.00 range with the connecto

 Anyone interested in any of these parts let me know:)

  Kyle
