Subject: Diesel Vanagon to Jetta Vanagon

Just seeing some conversation about transplants, and I thought I 
would throw in something interesting I saw.

There is a junkyard/wrecker here in British Columbia that basically 
scoops up all the VW's it can get.  They will take your diesel bus 
and throw in a late model Jetta engine from a wrecked Jetta (usually 
about 20,000-50,000 kms) and I think a trans also for 
about $2,200 Cdn.  They say they can't do it on the gas ones because 
there isn't enough room or something...  Anyways the thing apparently 
rips with the new engine, and is quite reliable.  Might even be less 
than rebuilding the diesel too.

What's $2,200 Cdn worth?  About $1,600 US?
