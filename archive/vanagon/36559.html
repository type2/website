&gt;&gt; 970 242-5267                get Tiger581  $84.99 includes shipping
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I just installed this one...easy.  Uses existing points as trigger
&gt;&gt; and has the capacity to switch from electronic to points if the unit 
&gt;&gt; fails.
&gt;
&gt;Martin,
&gt;
&gt;did you notice any improvement in power or efficiency? --Sami
&gt;
&gt;Considering I've only driven 50mile or so ...the jury is out.
 But I'll let everyone know.

It's now been a few days of driving and I can honestly say the CDI
is not for me.  My '71 bus runs worse with the CDI.  The main problem
is throttle response....slower, less quick low-end pick-up.  And going
down hill I get a slight backfiring I never had before.  Soooo...
I'm taking it off and sending it back.  

Martin
