Subject: AT Transmission Question??

Well I thought my AT was dead in my '87 Vanagon. Turns out it is still alive
but days may be numbered. After leaving me stranded at a stop light and
towing it home, I fired it up a few days later and viola it seems to work.
Changed the fluid just for fun. Drove it down to the end of the road and
back. It works!

Set out on a longer test trip. 3 miles down the road it starts making the
dreaded high pitch whine. I turn around. Before I get home, it leaves me
stranded again at a 4 way stop. I shut it off and push to the side of the
road. Sit there contemplating why I did not bring the cell phone. Just for
grins I fire it up and put it in gear. It works!

Made it home. At the end of the driveway, I stop to pickup the mail, leave
engine running and AT in park. Get back in, put it in D, no movement, no
sound. Shut off the engine, restart and put it in D. It works!

Does this sound like a MAJOR ($$$$) problem or  a minor ($) problem????         

OPTIONS SO FAR:
1. I know where I can get an AT out of an '85 for $500 (drop it in, sell the
van)
2. VW Dealer sells rebuilt ATs for $3600 and then $416 for labor (sorry
kids, no college)
3. ATectomy (transfer 4 speed from 82 to the 87 with lots of reengineering)
4. Keep looking
5. Find someone/someplace to rebuild mine
