&gt; I'm going to install an extra oil cooler on my Type IV 73 Westy.
&gt; I've had people tell me that they would install it &quot;up front&quot; on the front
&gt; beam. But to do this will require a lot of jazz I don't have. I will have to
&gt; buy a roll of copper tubing and braze fittings on it.


With the viscosity of oil, can you imagine how much oil pressure you are going
to lose by running the oil through 15 FEET of tubing!?!?  I think you would
need another oil pump somewhere in between!  You would also be increasing the
oil capacity of your system by a few quarts if you used tubing with a large
enough diameter to prevent too much loss of oil pressure....  You probably
wouldn't even NEED an oil cooler, 15 feet of copper tubing will provide almost
enough cooling in itself!

I don't think it will buy you anything but trouble to mount in the front.
