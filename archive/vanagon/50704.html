Subject: still looking for Westy.......
Date: Mon, 21 Oct 96 13:49:36 EDT

Hey all,
Just to let you folks know that I am still looking for a Westy,
preferably '76 to '83 and even more preferably an '80-'83 Vanagon Westy.
I know, it's not been long since I first announced my looking, but hey.
When you want one, you want one.  Basically I'm looking for something
within easy driving distance of Fredericksburg, VA.  By easy driving
distance I mean that if I can make it up and back in a weekend trip,
that's close enough for me to consider.  I'm a college student and can't
travel during the week.  

BTW, I got back my pix from the Seneca Rocks campout and Bug-Out 37
Manassas.  Very nice!  Now, if only I had a scanner, I'd put some of
these suckers on my web page.  Any scanner offerers? :)

Well, it looks like I'm finally going to get around to removing my
defunct a/c compressor.  I opened up the discharge valve just to see if
any stuff was left (don't worry, I wasn't going to dump Freon into the
environment, I was just pressure checking) and there was NOTHING in
there at all.  Surprise surprise.  So, the compressor will come out in
the interest of better engine compartment sealing but I will leave all
the rest of the a/c stuff in place (I will be selling my '78 when I get
my Westy) so that if a future owner wants a/c, he can install a new
compressor.  Looks like an easy job to remove it.  I will be filling the
gap with the correct piece of engine tin that I got from Jon Anderson
(thanks Jon!).

Sean
