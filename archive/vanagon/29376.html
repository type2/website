&gt; Has anyone had any luck rebuilding/lubricating an intermittently stuck Idle
&gt; Control Valve Stablizer Unit?  I'm talking about the cylindrical doohickey that
On the Corrado as most other Digifant injected VW's this is a
particularly troublesome part, for those who don't know, usual
symptom is engine will idle high, like 1500-2000 rpm, if you go rap on
the valve, it slows back down.  My best solution thus far, disconect
one of the hoses, spray in GUMOUT carb cleaner, spray in WD40 liberally.
Problem should dissapear.  Did on Mom's Passat and has 10000 miles
since.  Did it on the G60 about 2000 miles ago, still OK.  Note these
are covered under emission wartranty 5/50 but 7/70? in CA? so go
to dealer if you can prove it is acting up if still under the mileage
and bitch.
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  What's the consensus on flaming particular VW dealers who give BAD
&gt; advice/service? 
&gt; 
Oh yeah, please do, in fact once I took a survey to rate such.  Still
have a copy somewhere, San Fran results were poor for most.
