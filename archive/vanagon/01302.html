Subject:      Rubber-eating Porcupines! (film at eleven)

is that for real? i thought that was just a myth ... put out by the tire
companies. do the little sticky beasties really eat tires and rubber hoses?

we don't have porcupines down here (at least i don't think so ... i've never
seen one on the side of the highway ... and most EVERYTHING winds up on the
side of the road down here!).  we have chipmunks and squirrels that eat your
electrical wiring, though. even on buildings. we had a squirrel that tried
to eat through  the wiring in a pump house (when i worked for the water-works
back home). he shorted out a 300-hp electric well pump. i think it was about
200 amps on that breaker.  not an awful lot left of the squirrel ... in fact,
it took us a while to figure out what had happened.

hmmmm. from porcupines to fried squirrel. are you sure it's not friday yet?
