&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In my on-going attempt to try to get a Northeast and or East Coast
&gt; gathering this summer, here's another suggestion (as I haven't
&gt; heard anything further on B&amp;Js):
&gt; 
&gt; Saturday &amp; Sunday - July 15/16
&gt; 
&gt; CVA's 11th annual meet, Lime Rock Park, CT.
&gt; 
&gt; Saturday 7/15
&gt; 
&gt; Ruced rate admission to the SCCA Regional Races - including
&gt; FORMULA VEE!!
&gt; 
&gt; Drive the Track during the Lunch Break
&gt; 
&gt; CVA campout co-sponsored by LiMBO
&gt; 
&gt; Sunday 7/16
&gt; All VW Car show and Swap Meet - This year's featured Vehicle - TYPE 2s!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Free Dash Plaques (as opposed to dental plaque) for the first 150 entries
&gt; in the car show
&gt; 
&gt; For more info call John Kelly (203) 250-9119 - event chairperson
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So anyone up for this one? Or should I shut up? ( ok Steve Johnson...
&gt; I just gave you an opening  ;-)   )
