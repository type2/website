&gt;Which reminds me of an early episode in that English series &quot;The
&gt;Avengers.&quot; In a final scene, John Steed and Emma Peel stop their Bentley,
&gt;pop the hood, and there's their warm roastbeef picnic meal. Very
&gt;civilized.
&gt;
&gt;(Can't believe I still remember this! Must have been at least 20 years,
&gt;back in France, where the series was called &quot;chapeau melon et bottes de
&gt;cuir.&quot; Nothing to do with VWs, just that my infatuation with good food,
&gt;cars, and les nanas started very early on) ;-)


I saw &quot;The Love Bug&quot; when it first came out (now that's a LONG time ago!
Remember how the bad guys tried to stop herbie at one point--
scattered nails on the road, but only after slicing his spare tire
into about eight triangular sections, like a steel apple pie??? Now,
THAT was a dedicated saboteur!
