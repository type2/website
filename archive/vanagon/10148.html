Subject: Re:  Parts Needed- Cooling

I recently bought the thermo and bracket from Peek Performance here in DC.
The spring is not a tough item to come by as you can get a throttle return
spring to do the job. Make sure it will return the fins to open if the 
thermo fails. Junk yards are a gold mine for this stuff also.
