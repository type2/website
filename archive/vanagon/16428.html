Subject: Re: Clutch cables

&gt;Hey All..
&gt;
&gt;Just swapped out the 'ol clutch cable ... the only hard part is that
&gt;it happens at both ends of the bus 8)
&gt;
&gt;But this caused a pause of though...why do these things stretch?
&gt;I mean, they are made od steal, right? They don't stretch very
&gt;much for their whole life, and then BANG they grow an inch or two.
&gt;
&gt;Why? Curious minds (or bored) want to know!

They are breaking inside, a strand at a time.  Cables do not measurably
stretch.  I would check your pedal assembly to see if it is freezing up.  I
have to check the bus occasionally to see if the pedal shaft is frozen in
the bushing that it rides in.  With the cable disconnected it should be
completely loose.  The cross-shaft assembly should also be checked someday,
but that requires an engine pull.

Sincerely,
Eugene

Spreken se duetsch?  Nein.

I went to the Porsche museum in Stuttgart once though.
