&gt;
&gt;Driving a type 2 in the winter can be quite uncomfortable. Some days, I even
&gt;had snow freeze on my windshield while I was driving. It seems that by the

Here are the things I have done to my busses:

1 ) insulate the bus.  I used 3/4&quot; carpet padding on all of the walls 
(under the panels) and in the ceiling.

2) Insulate the tube that runs from the back to the front, under the bus.
I used more carpet padding, but sprayed it with undercoating.   I don't
know what year your bus is, though.  This was on an early bus...

3) Make sure that your heater boxes are not full of holes, and that all of
the hoses are secure.  You might be heating the great outdoors, and we don't
want to get into a discussion about global warming.

5) I made a &quot;cab separator&quot; out of canvas with a clear plastic window in
it.  This piece snaps in, and goes from the roof to the panel that goes 
behind the seats (non-walk-thru).  This was a huge improvement, because
I only could keep the warm air in the front, with me, and not send it 
to the back to try to melt the wax off of the surfboard...

And now for a question: why hasn't someone come out with stainless
steel heater boxes for VW's?  Why are we paying an arm and a leg for
these piece 'o shit steel ones that don't last?  And why hasn't 
somebody come up with a better heater box design?  Anyone who has
ridden in a 911 will know what I'm talking about...  Talk about 
toasty potential.  An quick too! (the heat :)

Jus tryin' to help
