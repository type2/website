&gt;I  would  like  to  know  were  will  be  bus  by  the  arch.
&gt;A  year  ago  I  was  looking  aroud  the  arch  but  was'nt  there,
&gt;is  because  I  did  not  send  the   for  more  info.So  plese  may  
&gt;I  have  more  info.   
&gt;                                           Tank  U

The name Busses by the Arch is misleading, because it actually takes place
in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is about 30 minutes West of the Arch, along
highway 70.

I don't know the exact location of the next meeting, since it has been
moved. (Bob H., do you know?) But as soon as I get the flyer, I'll post it
to this list. There's also a P.O.Box address to write to if you would like
to be on the mailing list. I have it at home and will post it tonight.
