Subject: Re: Tires...again...ack!

On this subject in general, I'd like to note as a strong supporter
of mail order tires, The Tire Rack has an EXCELLENT site where one
can view all their products and sizes, does not sort by size only
make and style is my only gripe, but one can see the tread pattern
of the Yokes, BFG, etc for comparison, sizes and load ranges listed.

They are at www.tirerack_dot_com

I have bought nearly all my tires for the last 5 years for a number
of vehicles from them, cept for the Sears Roadhandler AT's I threw on
the '78 last winter.  They incidentally were a good deal on sale for
a C loader 195/75 R14, and I have been quite pleased though other
listmembers have not always been, paid like $61 each on sale though,
hard to beat.

I also have been pleased with the Michelin LTX M/S though others
have not.  Available in a 195/75 R14 C or non C rated so be sure
to get the heavy duty one.
