Subject:      Re: Stalling at Idle when cold

Yo guys,

I'm in the same boat w/ my 86 GL. Stalls when cold. So far I've replaced
the Ignition wires, rotor and cap, O2 sensor (it was due) and checked
the idle stabilzer, air flow meter (temp sensor wouldn't go higher than
2.1K at about 45 degrees F - this could be a problem), temp sensor II,
idle stabilization relay (behind the RR light).

I also tried to advance the timing a degree or two, but I'm putting it
back again - runs rich.

I've had this problem since January when I took it to Chicago and froze
it  at -10 degrees F. Think that could of done something? It started off
as an occasional morning stall after a 50 mile ride the night before.
Now it stalls every time I start it but runs fine after  3-4 city
blocks.

I'am about to test the thottle stuff next.

Any ideas?

TIA

&gt;FWIW -

&gt;Let's try to remember that the Digijet Wasserboxer (83-85) uses an
&gt;Auxilary Air Valve.  The Digifant (86-91) does not.  Idle Stabilization
&gt;at cold or hot temps on these two FI types are handled somewhat
&gt;differently.&gt; Thanks :-)
