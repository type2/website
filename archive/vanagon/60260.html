While there was agreement to meet at Ron Salmon's outpost Sunday at
1PM, but I remember hearing somewhere (Type 2 Chat Group?) that Ron is
not 
going to be there. Ron, can you confirm, yes or no? 

We are going to show the Silver Syncro Westie, mostly because the 
parking is more central and its cheaper to get in with a car-load of
kids. 

If Ron will not be there, we could  meet at my bus at the same time,
1PM.
I'll be wearing my black Type2_dot_com T-shirt. Hope to see you all.

Tom F.
