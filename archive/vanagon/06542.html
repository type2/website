Subject: Re: EV oil change- post mortem


Norman's tale of the oil change on his EV was interesting. As of
yet I haven't changed the oil myself....partially because I'm
getting lazy in my old age. I really don't feel like undoing the
lower engine bay cover, and then wiggling a wrench up into the
engine compartment to get at the filter.

The second reason is my dealer periodically sends out these oil-
change for $15.00 complete with oil and filter cupons. These cupons
arrive when the EV is ready for an oil change. What I usually do
is show up at the dealer with a 6 pack of Mobil1 and tell the
service manager to use my oil instead of theirs.

It works out like this. As Norman mentioned the oil filter from
VW is $11.00 or so, right? I paid $15 for the oil service, which
means I pay $4.00 labor for an oilchange. They have to go thru
the hassle of popping the engine compartment cover, removing the
filter and then getting rid of the drain oil.

BTW, my best oil change so far occured in September when I cashed in
on a free oil change cupon I received from VWUS!!  8-)
