Subject: RE: Window tinting

&gt;From: lmacphe_at_cello.gina_dot_calstate_dot_edu (Larry R. MacPhee)

&gt; &gt;#4 - Also, a while back I asked about tinting Vanagon windows.  Well
&gt; &gt;I've done my research and am having it done this weekend.  I like
&gt; &gt;a survey for which is best way to go.
&gt; &gt;I've seen lots a vans with windows tinted but two ways really (I
&gt; &gt;think) look good:
&gt; &gt;a. a darker tint (75% grey) all windows except driver side and
&gt; &gt;   passenger side.  i.e. everything behind doors.
&gt; &gt;b. a medium tint  (60% grey) all windows.
&gt;
&gt; I have a second question: Is there more than one tinting process?  I've
&gt; seen some really bad looking jobs that appear to be stick-on and full of
&gt; air bubbles.  Personally I'd rather wear shades.

I tinted our vanagon myself several years ago.  I have also did a bus and
several other vehicles without any bubbles.  You have to make sure the windows
are clean.  Using a razer blade will pick up dirt that window cleaners and
towels will leave behind.  The bad jobs are where the bubbles are not squeegied
out.  The water then evaporates and it looks terrible after that.

As for what tint and where you may have to check you local and state laws.
Here in Georgia before 1990 it was anything goes.  You could put on 90-95% and
not get in trouble.  After that all you can only get 60%.  There is an
exception where buses and vans can use 80% but only behind the front seats and
with an inspection sticker.  Good thing because that's what I had done in 88
and did not want to rip it all off.  I got it to pass by tearing off just the
driver and passenger windows.  Did that in a K-Mart shopping and returned to
the state patrol office and got it to pass 15 minutes later.
