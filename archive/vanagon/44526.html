Subject: Stranded in L.A. - 81 won't start

For those who remeber, Last week my vanagons fuel gauge stopped
working so I ran out of gas (didn't know this until I was towed to my
mechanic and he dertimed the problem).  Well, I picked up the van,
filled up w/ gas, set my trip odometer to zero ( that's my new gas
gauge), and drove home about eight miles.   Next day I drove to L.A. 
about 50 miles w/o any problems.  The following morning the van wouldn't
start.  It turns over fine but nothing.  I spoke to the mechanic to see what
he did in the original problem resolution.  He pulled one of the plug wires
to check for spark and checked gas hoses for leaks (they were tight, no
leaks).  Tonight I'll recheck the plug wires but what else can I  do to 
determine/ fix this?  Gas must be fine, I assume fuel pump is also.
Any checks/ideas/tips explained in laymans terms would be much
appreciated.  Thanks.
My girlfriend is  telling me to 'throw that damn thing away' since I've
had to put in clutch, trans, gas gauge out, and now this in the last two months.
And that hurts!
