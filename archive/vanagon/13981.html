Subject: mile marker 1042

On Tuesday of this week, at mile 1042, my freshly rebuilt engine siezed up.  
I was quite bummed.  It seems that the case wasn't align-bored corectly, and 
the main bearings were too tight.  So, I gotta take it all apart again, but 
hey look on the bright side: all the parts are clean!  I am begining to 
wonder about reusing any VW case.  It's interesting, the motor still turns 
over (slowly), but will not start.  I can't turn it over using the generator 
nut, which sort of implies things are tight downstairs.  I guess I'm in the 
same position as Dave Kautz.  I had suspected that things were wrong, but 
the machinist had assembled the case and said It'll be OK.  Muir is always 
right, trust yourself, it's the only way to fly.
