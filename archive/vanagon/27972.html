and no, not the the off-road racing sanctioning body!

My boss came up to me yesterday and sez &quot;I was cleaning the garage and found
something you might want&quot;  Quick visions of a '51 23-window danced in my
head, along with visions of boxes of NOS bus parts (He's an X-VW Junkie)

Turns out its an engine stand, and an _industrial_ one at that.  About
4-5' at the base, _heavy_ guage steel, looks like it was designed for
working on V8's instead of VW's!

So we loaded this gem in the bus today, only problem is now I have to
figger out what to DO with it!  Buy hey, the price was right...
