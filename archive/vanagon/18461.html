Martha and Joel are the experts on this one....there does't seem to be a
consensus but they seem to be found in Westys of the
following kinds: pre 80s, 80-83.5s and diesels. Some have said its just an
auxiliary plug, others seem to think its for a car seat heater and others
for a CB. My guess? A map light plug. DC
