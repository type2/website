&gt; Hi Ralf,
&gt;=20
&gt; The reason for the question was to find the source of the spam. Several
&gt; non-vw lists that I subscribed too were eventually shut down from being
&gt; inundated by such messages, eventually totalling over 50 per day!
&gt;=20
&gt; My interests lied within protecting my favorite list, not to complain.
