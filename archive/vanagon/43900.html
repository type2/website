&gt;I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to fit a Yakima bike carrier on
&gt;top of my 90 Westfalia.  I would like to have the ability to carrier up to
&gt;four bikes at a time or two bikes and a canoe.  I realize that it would be
&gt;a pain to remove all the carrier hardware everytime you wanted to pop the
&gt;top but it may be worth it, if I can carry all this stuff.  I would
&gt;appreciate any suggestions on how folks carry this type of gear.  I have a
&gt;lot of Yakima hardware from the past and would like to utilize it if
&gt;possible.  Is a tailgate carrier a better alternative for bikes?  Or maybe
&gt;the trailer hitch type?
&gt;
&gt;

Go woth the trialer type hitch.  Bikes standing on the roof add an awfull lot
of wind resistance.  Maybe the canoe should go up there. My clas 3 style
hitch is ideal for this application.
