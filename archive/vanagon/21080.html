Yes, I did use some teflon tape, everywhere.  The elect. connection 
(ground) did cross my mind, but when I later pulled out the temp. sensor 
to test, I am convinced the teflon tears and there is metal-to-metal contact.
I did not put new tape on the sensor when I put it back in and there was 
still no response.  The extra ground connection is worth testing, I will 
try it.

For the oil temp. I've got a porsche friend checking his catalogs for a 
sump plate with the fitting.  Or do I have to drill a hole in mine?

I can then eliminate the T and 6-inch nipple.  I don't want to cut the 
tin for the pressure sensor.  I like the idea of a flexible hose.

BTW Sami, I chickened out of mounting the gauges in the dash. :)
I got a panel at FLAPS and put it right above my right knee.
