Joel dreams:
&gt; 
&gt; i still there there ought to be some tiny little generator that would fit in
&gt; the back fender corner and put out enough juice to power a westafilia for a
&gt; whole day on a half-gallon of gas.  somewhere, there's got to be one!
&gt; 

In my past as a college student, I remember reading lots of &quot;subversive&quot;
books about survivalists, living after the nuclear war, defending oneself
against the almost-all-poweful guvmint.  Books with titles like _Mantrapping_,
_How_to_Kill_, and _How_to_Survive_the_Coming_Nuclear_War_.

Anyway, most of the authors had no desire to live in caves without the
comforts of civilization after the bombs dropped.  A solution to the electricity
problem was solved (for those without a handy creek for hydro) by using
a very small diesel motor driving a (relatively) large flywheel, which
in turn would drive the generator.  Supposedly you could order one of
these gems; the engines were of Chinese manufacture, and were simple
enough to run &quot;forever&quot;.  Also, the idea behind the flywheel was to keep
the engine running at the rpm that gave the greatest efficiency.  These
engines reportedly use very little fuel, and can run on all sorts of 
nasty fuel oils.  I think the engines were either one or two cylinders
(maybe another reason for the large flywheel?)

Don't know about noise levels, but I suppose they'd keep them quiet so 
the engine noise wouldn't attract the Paramilitary Forces of the Occupying
Army.

Just a thought from fringes.
