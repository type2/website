Subject: Thanks for the help! 79(80) Convert


I want to publicly thank all of you who took the time (or a 
friend's time) to translate the letter I received from the VW
Museum. The odd thing about this letter is that I never wrote
to the museum requesting information, I sent (and received) a
letter to VW Customer Assistance and also Wilhelm Karmann. 
Perhaps Karmann forwarded it to the Museum. Who knows.

So I now have two letters...

one from VW Customer Assistance, and one from the Museum.



The interesting thing about the production date is that it
is January 7, 1980, three days after the birth of my 
oldest son, and three days before the last bug convert
rolled off the line at Karmann.

Another interesting thing that has come to mind as a result
of this letter is just how much of an impact this &quot;information
highway&quot; has. Imagine receiving a letter from Germany, requesting
a translation via the net, and getting translations from as
far away as Australia!! In the imortal words of Arte Johnson..
&quot;Veeeeeerrry EEEEeeenteresting&quot;!

Anyway, got the Convert registered yesterday, drove it around
for an hour or so to get the new engine loosened up. Took my
2 year old son out for a quick spin in what he calls &quot;New
Bug&quot;! Both dad and son were in 7th heaven!!

Got to run...need to track down a heater so I can be warm
while doing the brake job!
