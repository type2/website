July 19, 1997 - A VW affair on the Independence Square - Bug Blitz 1997 -
Independence, Missouri (just outside Kansas City)
 
 This years Bug Blitz will be held at the historic Independence Square in
Independence, Missouri.  This is a GREAT site and the store owners are going
all out for us.  The new site has restrooms with running water, lots of
antique stores for bored spouses, four restraunts, two ice cream parlors, two
ATM machines for those unexpected swap meet purchases, LOTS of parking, trees
for shade, and much more.  

CAMPING sites with a huge pool less than two miles away.  Several Bed and
Breakfasts' within walking distance.
 
As always spectator admission is FREE and all models of VW's are welcome.
 National magazine coverage by Hot VW's.
