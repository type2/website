&gt;I was wondering if anyone would be interested in running some kind of
&gt;&quot;workshop&quot; during BUSES BY THE ARCH a few weeks from now?

&gt;(502) 583-5835 (machine answers--it may be rather odd)

Que? What, may I ask, is/was/will be BUSES BY THE ARCH?

Being in St. Louis I tend to equate &quot;Arch&quot; with our local stainless-steel 
landmark.
