         Do you have a phone number or address for Python?  A way to get in
 touch with them or get a catalog?

Hi, Eric,   After teasing everyone with that Python stuff I guess I should
figure out how others can get it.  My product line brochure has not a single
address on it, just the little space where they stamp &quot;Distributed By:&quot;  The
shop I get this stuff at is a BapGeon dealer as well but don't know if the
two are related.  I'm going down there today to pick up my weekly grocery
sack full of Vanagon parts so I will ask if they have a 1-800 number for
folks out of town.

If you want to call around locally yourself to auto parts stores, the
company's name is Python Injection Inc.
