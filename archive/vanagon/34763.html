So Anthony Luscre says:
&gt; 
&gt; 86 Vanagon
&gt; When it is very cold I end up with a puddle of coolant under van after driving.
&gt; The puddle is near driver's side of engine toward front of van.
&gt; Leak seems to be worst the colder it gets (-8 here this weekend).
&gt; Any ideas ??
&gt; Thanks Anthony

Yeah, I had this leak.  It's coming from the auxilary heater under the
bench seat.  Check the bleed screw and the hoses with someone else to
help rev. the engine when you look.  Aux. heater coolant valve in the
open position, of course.
