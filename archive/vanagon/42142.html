&gt; &gt; Driving past the Irvine Meadows marquee yesterday, they have posted
&gt; &gt; 'VW  Classic 6/9'.   So this must be the bigger, better version as compared
&gt; &gt; to the VW Jamboree.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; they do not even compare.  free entry for your VW at the classic.  this is
&gt; the best weekend for VW's in So. Cal.  who's going?  i will be there.  my
&gt; crew cab might be there.
&gt; 
&gt;  Take care and God Bless
