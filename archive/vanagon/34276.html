Subject: re [F] Extra large engines

&gt;Last I saw on PBS a show called something like 'B-29: Frozen in time'.

I saw this too last night. These guys reminded me of some of the
enthusiasts on this list who discover some ancient 'craft' out in someones
field and spend the next year bringing it back to life!

The engines are air-cooled, with 18 radial cylinders. They had this beater
of a plane they were using to get back and forth to Greenland in and they
had to keep working on it as well. And they even brought new engines and
installed them.
I'm telling you, the parallels were striking.

Oh, and what's even worse about the ending: they were trying to take off
across a frozen lake. In a couple of weeks after the fire, the plane sank
to the bottom!

they seemed to take it pretty well though. (at least on camera.)
