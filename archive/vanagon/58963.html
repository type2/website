&gt;Hi listees: Have been lurking n the sidelines learning all I can about my 
&gt;86 Westy. Just crawled out from under it and found that the clutch slave 
&gt;cylinder is leaking. Is this a 'do it yourself' repair for a fair handy 
&gt;person? Any info on how to do will be appreciated and the cost of the 
&gt;unit. Or is there a rebuild kit avaiable? 
&gt;
&gt;The people on this list are great and I hope you can help.......

&gt;pep boys has a rebuild kit for 12 bucks. piece of cake repair, just make
sure your slave cylinder has a smooth inner bore and no corrosion.
