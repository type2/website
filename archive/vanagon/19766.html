  I suppose I shall add my $.02 to Jason's report. After a 4 hr. delay
leaving Raleigh, (ALWAYS keep an extra $%&amp;^%$^ clutch cable!!!), we
drove most of the way to a small town in Virginia, about 30 miles out of
DC. We got there about 4 am, and parked in a commuter parking lot. Very
nice and safe, but no bathrooms...
Saturday night after the concert, we drove about 20 miles out and stayed
at a rest stop on I-95. (with bathrooms)
Sunday night, we were all tired, and decided to stay again at the
commuter parking lot, as we knew where it was, and couldn't drive very
far. 
  Saw hundreds of late models and vanagons, and actually saw some
upwardly-mobile-but-still-hippies driving stickered eurovans. I did
count seven or eight 65-67 white Westy's, and a few splits, but no
pickups of any years. Other than that, I have to rebuild and probably
fabricate my accelerator assembly, as it is pretty much in horrible
shape. the pedal already has a door hinge, and the other pieces are
crapping out on me now. And since it never rains, it pours, I must also
replace my transmission mount.
WHEW!
Anyway, I had a great time, and am now awaiting the next East Coast
gathering-Sometime in July?????
