&gt;To add a note of mystery, on the driver's side the cap has a
&gt;little square hole in it (a little less than 1/4&quot; square) and
&gt;there's a, uh, thing sticking out of it, bright metal,
&gt;square in cross-section, with a little groove around it
&gt;and a C-ring in the groove.  It looks something like the 
&gt;back end of a small machine tap.  There was silicone sealant
&gt;smeared over the thing to keep water out.  We bought the 
&gt;van almost new (7000 miles on it), so I assume the dealer
&gt;did this, whatever it is.  (The passenger-side cap has no
&gt;such ornament.)

The &quot;ornament&quot; is one end of the speedometer cable.  Rear wheel drive VWs use
the left front wheel to drive the speedometer.  The Corvair (not to bring it
up again, but too late!) had the same thing.
