Subject: Re: Analog Mouse

Unfortunately, the mice seem to get in thru the *tiniest* spaces and wreak
havoc anyway.  Last year they built a nest inside the departed Otto's gas
heater and caused a fire (careless smoking, probably...).  Then they filled
the new heater with onion rings our son left in the back seat--the Bus
smelled like a greasy spoon for weeks, and I had onion ring bits flying out
of the heater for days.

Solution?  D-Con and mousetraps.  I can't handle mothballs, and that won't
work 100% unless you have 'em everywhere.  I checked the moustraps every
morning and had success (well, success from my viewpoint; mice see it
otherwise...).  The D-Con seemed less attractive than the peanut
butter-filled traps.  Anyway, I had no dead, rotting mousies in the Bus, and
got rid of them, too.
