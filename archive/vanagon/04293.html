Fellow non-conformers...

  My wife just called to *admit* that fixing NuBus was worth the money.
She enjoyed driving to work today. I drove it for the &quot;checkride&quot; 
yesterday, and noticed a power increase. I figure it must be due to
the bad-piston in the old engine. With a 48hp diesel, *any* improvement
is noticeable.

 Now, two questions:

1) Now that the weather is colder (snow any day now...), the heat gets
used. When we enable the heat, we hear a gurgling from under the right
front dash. I see no liquid dripping, but noises always bother me. Any ideas?


2) The right front window keeps falling &quot;off-the-track&quot;. In reality,
the little white square plastic &quot;hoo-de-doo&quot; which connects the window
to the slide is broken. Anybody have an extra one? (Paid for with the
standard Convex Computer Corp paraphanalia (sic) payment plan {right Joel?})
