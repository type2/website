&gt;&gt;The Type IV engine, used in 1972-1983 VW vans, is air-cooled, and a much

&gt;&gt;more powerful and longer-lasting engine than the pre-1972 VW engines.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;You forgot to mention that Type I powerplants will carry you twice as far for
&gt;the same bucks and with less hassle, based on overhaul costs and parts
&gt;availability.

True, Type IV engine rebuilds and parts are too damned expensive.  Probably
because there are not enough Type IV engines out there for mass production
to be feasible and foster competition to lower the prices.  But to me,
R&amp;Ring an engine, especially a Type IV with fuel injection, is a hassle.  I
prefer to have to do it no more often than 150k or more miles.  And, with a
heavy aluminum crankcase, beefier innards, hydraulic lifters ('78-on) and
built in oil filter, it still _IS_ a better engine design.  The added power
helps, especially when heading up steep mountain passes.  I can climb many
of them in fourth gear.

Too bad there are not lots more Type IVs out there.  Some folks are putting
Type IV engines in their Beetles, '68-'71 Baywindows and old Splitties.
Somebody runs an ad in Hot VWs, selling plans for this conversion.  I think
that I remember an article or series run in this mag detailing a conversion
to Type IV engine.  Yeah, here it is, the ad, anyway: &quot;The Type IV Upright
Conversion Manual,&quot; available for $29.95, plus $3.95 s/h, from Next
Generation, PO Box 632, Pomona NY 10970.

I don't know anything about the company or manual other than what's in the
ad.  Sounds like maybe a good alternative to putting a V6 or whatever in
there.  Why doesn't somebody who's considering a conversion to V6, Volvo,
Subaru, or whatever buy this and let us know what you think? 

Cheers,

Cheese
