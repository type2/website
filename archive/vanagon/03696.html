&gt;    The last time I replaced the shocks I went to a VW dealer.  I'm
&gt;    wondering if there are cheaper after-market shocks for my '72
&gt;    kamper?  What make &amp; specs do you recommend?  I drive in the city

i used to get shocks for my 71 and 73 at sears. they didn't last all that
long (i think a couple of years), but then, they didn't cost very much either.
FLAPS should be able to get Monroe or some other brand, but they'll very
likely have to order them ... i doubt that even Midas would have bus shocks
in stock.

bread-loafs are lucky, as regards shocks. cheap and easy to replace. the
vanagons get stuck with Big Prices and the fronts are not a lot of fun to
replace. But ... It Can Be Done! :)
