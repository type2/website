Subject: perception of EV reliability

&gt;I can't believe the reports I'm seeing of these problems with EVs.  It's
&gt;amazing to me that a vehicle that new has all kinds of expensive
&gt;problems.  Transmissions having to be dismantled, fuel injection, all kinds
&gt;of weirdness.  It's just not right!

Now wait a minute. There are only 21 EV owners on this list, and we've only
heard complaining from two of them, and only one with a (potentially)
serious electrical problem (Tim). While that's about 10% of the given
population, this is an awfully small sample from which to make
generalizations.

For the record: I've had more problems with carburetors than with fuel
injection systems on every car I've owned. (Of course that rebuilt
carburetor on my 75 GMC only cost $150! It's hard to find a rebuilt or
rebuilt ECU for some Vanagons these days) While this too is a short list it
shows me that FI is not the problem: GMC pickups, VW Rabbit, Dodge Colt,
Volvo(s), Vanagon and now the EV.

Parts on all imported cars are expensive, even those for the Vanagons. You
can find parts in junkyards for those vehicles, you can't for the EVs
(yet).
Given the price differentials we're seeing lately from people shopping
around, it's clear where some VW dealers are making their extra profit
margins.
