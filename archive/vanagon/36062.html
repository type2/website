Subject: Re: Installing Engine in 78 westie

Clay,

I found that the engine is very heavy and difficult to handle, especially
if the heater boxes and fan housing are still attached (I suggest you
attach those later). By the same token, I would definitely not install the
engine and transmission in one block.
