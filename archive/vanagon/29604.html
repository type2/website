Subject: Re: source for oil cooler foam seal?

&gt;Does anyone have a decent source for the foam pad that wraps around
&gt;the oil cooler?  This is the thin piece of foam that covers the top,
&gt;front, and rear of the cooler, and acts as an air seal so that all the
&gt;air goes through it rather than around it.  RMMW knows what it is, but
&gt;doesn't carry it....

I don't think that either my 87 or my 88 have this part.  Maybe I should get
some too.  Please let me know what you find out.   :-)

No, I'm not serious.  I just wish more people would include the model year of
their particular interest.  Preferably in the message's subject.
