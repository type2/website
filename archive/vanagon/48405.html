Subject: '86 CV Boots 

Hello Listies
     I have noticed that my front inboard CV joint boot is torn.:-(  
I have checked the archieves and could'nt find a reference to a good source.
I bought the outboard boots from VW, and I dont want to pay that much again,
if I can help it.  Also any pointers on changing the boots would be
appriciated.  It seems that my van is lonely, it wants me to work on it
more.  I also need rear hatch struts, the head light switch, and a coolent
expansion tank.  I found a reference for the struts, NAPA is supposed to
have them.  I would appriciate any help.  TIA :-)
