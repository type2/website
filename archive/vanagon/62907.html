Brands of Phosphate-Free Coolant I've run across while on the list
include:

Autobahn - This is the factory stuff.  It's also the most expensive too
($11 to $12 per gal., maybe more).

Sierra - One of the first Phosphate-Free Coolants to hit the aftermarket.

Zerex Extreme - This one's been a little hard to find.

Prestone 4/60 - Discontinued and superseded to a newer label called
Prestone 5/100

In a recent engine swap, I went ahead and used the Prestone 5/100
purchased at Wal-Mart.  About $7 per gal.  Recommended by a long-time
Water Cooled only Ve-dub mechanic I've known for over 20 years and I
usually follow his advice when I get stumped on something or other.

There was one posting recently from a listee claiming to use regular
Prestone for quite a awhile in their Wasser with no apparent ill effects.
 In society, there will always be a few risk-taking non-conformists out
there.  That's what makes life so great, right?  Well, more power to them
too.

&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;Someone a couple of days ago asked what brands of coolant are cool for
&gt;Vanagons (&quot;phosphate-free&quot;).  If anyone answered, I missed it.
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday I went to K-Mart and looked at Prestone (that's all they
&gt;had!).  I remember reading a month or two ago that someone was going
&gt;strong with Prestone.  Prestone was kind enough to list their
&gt;ingredients:  ethelyne glycol, water, and &quot;proprietary&quot; additives. 
&gt;Period.  No &quot;phosphate-free&quot; marker on the jug. . . .  No hint at the
&gt;formulation of their &quot;proprietary&quot; stuff.
&gt;
&gt;I have been running on h2o alone for a month or two, since I burst a
&gt;hose during a creeping commute to the nation's capital.  Replacing the
&gt;coolant will be my first serious task on my new '87 GL.  I have the
&gt;Bentley manual. . . .  
&gt;
&gt;Advice?  Ideas?  Thanks!!!
