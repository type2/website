&gt; &gt; You all know that 11.9 volts is a dead battery; 12.25 is half charged, and
&gt; &gt; 12.6 is fully charged, right? 
&gt; 
&gt;     No, that's not true. A battery in good shape, fully charged would 
&gt; read about 13.5 volts, not 12.6. Any battery that only reads 12.6 after
&gt; a good charging-up is ready for retirement. And anything reading only
&gt; 12 or less is junk. In fact, I wouldn't dream of keeping any battery
&gt; this time of year that read anything less than 13v after a charge.

Harmon,
	I think you will find that as soon as you attach a small load
to that battery, or leave it sit for a few hours, the voltage will drop
down to around 12.7.  I wasn't sure of this myself until I got a decent
digital multimeter.  The 13.5 reading that one gets briefly after charging
a battery is pretty meaningless.  I have had old batteries that read 13.5
after a charge, but dropped to 10.5 (or less) within a few minutes when they
were put under a 5 amp load (da fridge).
