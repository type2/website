Subject: great shuddering VW's

Someone recently wrote in about their new clutch shuddering occasionally and
wondered if it was the mounts.  I recently had the head gasket replaced on
my '84 Westy (ouch!) and since then, it shudders very occasionally coming
out of first gear.  Also, while sitting at idle, the van shakes slightly
with the engine.  I was wondering about the mounts when this other post came
up.  Could it be?  If so, would it have anything to do with the head gasket
replacement?  (Hope this isn't a stupid question!  Please be kind.)  How
expensive is it to replace motor mounts??
