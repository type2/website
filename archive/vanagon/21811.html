Subject: 74 no-poptop westie for sale in sf bay area

It is with much regret that I finally have to sell the old beast, but I'm not 
using it, and someone else might have a lot of fun with it (and I could use 
the cash)  so...


Cheap to good home

1974 non-poptop westfalia.  White with green interior.  it says 13k miles, 
figure 113k.
  
The upside: 
Most of the camping stuff is intact.  The sink works (after replumbing and 
replacing the pump), inside 110v power works.  It has a builtin microwave oven 
, lots of cabinet space, a comfy bed, a recently reupholstered passenger seat 
(plus materials to upholster the driver's seat as well, which I may do one of 
these days) electronic compass, stereo, etc etc.  It drives reasonably well - 
front end is in good shape, I just replaced the power boost on the breaks, so
it stops nicely.  Steering is heavy, but busses are like that.  Tires look
okay.  
Recently had the valves done, plus new rod bearings, engine runs okay, passed 
emissions last year, has all pollution control equipment required.

The downside:
The engine is from a 1973 beetle - eg 1600cc dual port.  It's got the 
california sticker to prove the engine is 
okay for this car.  The engine is just hung on the end of the tranny - no rear
mount or crossmember, and there are great gaping gaps between the engine and 
engine compartment.  Also the tranny is a tad noisey.  Paint is ugly, and 
there's a bit of rust here and there and two (smaller than a dime) rust 
through spots, plus the occasional dent.

The upshot - a pretty good westie at a bargain price... I'm asking $1000 obo.
I'd rather not sell it as a parts car (hence the good home part) as it still has
some sentimental value to me.
