Subject: next CCC's camping trip


The results of the voting are in:  looks like the preferred date
for camping is the June 14th weekend for most of you.  I therefore
nominate that we put this on the calender and also nominate our
recently discovered &quot;find&quot; as the location:  in Sequoia National Forest,
where some of us ended up weekend before last.  

Mark the dates, and stay tuned...

DISCAIMER:  If you find roaring campfires, barroom conversation,
communal meals, occasional music and fermented beverages into the
night offensive, please camp in adjacent sites at your own risk.
Some humor may be enlarged to show detail; user assumes full liabilities;
not liable for damages due to use or misuse; quantities are limited as
supplies last; do not puncture, incinerate or store above 120 deg. F.
call before you dig, your mileage will vary, not available in any store.
