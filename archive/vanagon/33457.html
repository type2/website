Subject: Live chat night

Hi Volks,
   I'm throwing out a line to see if anyone bites.  Is anyone interested in
doing a live chat night?  I'll be glad to set it up if I get enough
interest.  Just a thought. We could talk about anything that comes to mind,
of course I thought we would talk VW's, but hey who knows?  If anyone is
interseted let me know.  You will need a program to do live chat. PC users
will probably need mIRC38  and Mac users can get ircle 2.2.  You may find
them a your internet providers FTP site. Or write me and I can get you some
more info.Looking forward to hearing from you.  Lets all talk live!

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
