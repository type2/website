Subject: red rock/food/etc.


Ok, looks like we are getting a fair sized gathering for this upcoming
weekend's campout at Red Rock, east of Bakersfield, CA.  The
cuisine is German; I'm making sauerbraten meatballs, a potato
dish, pickled red-cabbage.  Steve/Linda Johnson are bringing
applesauce and probably apple-strudel.  Bradley's making home-made
pretzels, plus some other myster concoctions, and Jack is bringing his
inimitable homebrew.  This is all mostly for Saturday nite, since
many people are arriving after dinner on Friday.  I therefore suggest
that Friday dinner be very informal, bring your own, share if you
wanna, etc.  

Btw, I also made some prune brandy.  :)
