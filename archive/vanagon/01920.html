Subject: Wesphalia Syncro Pricing?

I am actively in the market for a Westphalia Syncro (preferably a 90 or
91, but would consider an older one in great shape) and am totally in the
dark as to what's a fair price for one.

While the dealers keep telling me how rare they are, there seems to be one
or two on the market just about any time I look (in Seattle). Perhaps not
suprisingly, they are almost always being sold by dealerships, not private
parties, making me think that the dealers are taking them from people who
are trading them in and jacking the price sky high for potential suckers
like me who MUST have one. The prices I have seen are way, way above blue
book.

What do people think is a good price for one of these rigs? If you've seen
one for sale in your area, how much were they asking? If you've bought one
used in the past year or so, what did you pay for it, and what kind of
condition was it in. And regarless of how you purchased it, if you own
one, at what price would you consider selling (assuming that you did want
to sell)?

Also, the dealerships have mentioned that there was a recall on these for
a head bolt/head gasket problem. Anyone have the real dirt on this, and
were there any other recalls on these?

Thanks!

Paul
