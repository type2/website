Subject:       [F]riday!  Woo-hoo!

At last Friday.  T-minus 1:45 and I'm outta here.  Working over 
spring break is a drag!

Ok, VW stuff.

When the Pioneer is cold something in the front just squeaks like 
crazy when you hit bumps.  It sounds like it is coming from the 
middle of the front (so I discount the shocks doing it).  Do I have a 
cricket colony in my heater tubes? :)

Would those rubber busings be the culprate.  Should I get out the 
Grease and squirt it all over them?

Anyone else with an old bus have this same problem, besides my 
friends '64 whose squeak mysteriously just quit after a while?

Lastly.  I found a SWEET Wood/Metal (old-style) roof rack on a green 
early 60's around here.  I've stopped by and heard the people in the 
house, but no one answered.  As I was getting in my bus to leave I 
saw someone peek through the blinds...  Boy it felt like I was on a 
Mormon mission again!  &lt;grin&gt;

Well, best wishes to all this weekend!
