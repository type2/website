Yes, I have seen 914 badges that said &quot;VW-Porsche--914&quot; all in the same badge.
And the 914 engine is the same as in the late bus, just different exh.,carb/FI
and mount. style ..............except for the 914-6, which was the Porsche flat
6.

Oh, yeah, BTW it's pronounced Porsch-uh........
