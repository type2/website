Subject: Re: engine tin

	Remember to check the rubber seals around the tin. VWs
need that tin in place and the seals preventing hot air from the
bottom of the engine rising into the engine compartment.

	Second cheapest: 
	Clean-up with wirebrush, solvent, etc.
	Take to Sand Blaster.
	Inspect to make sure they got everything.
	Paint with rust converter, etc.

	Sand blasting is a great way to remove old paint and
primer. It doesn't remove grease, and isn't very good on rust, however.

	Maybe the best sequence is 
	Clean up,
	Naval Jelly or other phosphoric acid, wash, rinse, etc.
	Rust converter
	dry
	sand blast
	prime &amp; paint same day.

	I don't know how rust converter works, but the Plasticoat stuff
brushes on white and turns dark blue... seems to work too.

	Remember that any single-step (spray can) primer isn't
waterproof and must be over-coated within a few weeks. Rustoleum
say theirs can be painted over immediately and so I do.

	Cheers!
	Bill
