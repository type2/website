Subject: H2O heads completed!

HOORAY!!

the dirty deed be done.  i've whipped the irrascable and wily 
wasserboxer.  it runs.  and it don't leak no mo'

still have to finalize valve adjustment, get a new radiator cap, and 
figure out a new oil buzzer problem i think is a result of a new, but 
maybe wrong, pressure switch i installed.

y'all don't care about my anguish and bloodied hands so i'll skip 
that story and get to the costs.  but i do have to say i broke not a 
single bolt or fastener.

i elected to replace several items while i was 'in there'  these are:

water pump, Graf brand			$110
exhaust to converter			421
	this was a Dansk aftermarket and i was extremely pleased with the 
quality and fit.  seems better than OEM.
thermostat					20
rebuild alternator				52
metal flange for coolant
instead of plastic				18
oil switch					10
various ss bolts				10
various hose clamps			10 

the costs to do the leaking heads are based soley on expensive gasket 
sets and some JB Weld to fill in the pits (more on this later).  so:

left &amp; right gasket sets			250
JB Weld					 5.95

all parts were obtained thru our local VW dealer.  i must thank the 
service manager, John Wildmo, for stocking and ordering aftermarket 
parts, giving free advice, and not nicking me too bad on prices.

i don't want to have to do this again for a VERY long time.....
