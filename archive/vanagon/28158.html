&gt;&gt; I came across a reference in the archives to a cooling system flange
&gt;problem
&gt;&gt; and want to flag this to (at least) 86 vanagon owners...and probably
&gt;several
&gt;&gt; later years.  On the 86, a cooling hose enters the engine block under the
&gt;&gt; alternator through a plastic flange. (See Bentley p19.14--lower right of
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; diagram with the 20 Nm designation.) This flange easily snaps off if any
of
&gt;&gt; the drive belts break.  VW apparently discovered this problem and has a
&gt;&gt; replacemnt flange 025 121 160D made from steel which apparently solves the
&gt;&gt; problem. 

Yep, Been there. Replaced that.
