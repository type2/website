Subject: '73 Camper in good shape
Date: Thu, 01 Sep 94 17:25:52

Spent alot of time getting this bus ready for this 2.0l pancake I WAS
going to put in but I don't have anytime or patience to deal with
the conversion so I want to get rid of it and get a hold of something
I can just drop the 2.0l engine into.  I'm looking to either trade
for '75-78 bus transporter body or sell my camper body for $500.

Contact me here or call 217 3988662...by the way the camper is in Champaign, IL
