Subject:       Westy-ectomy and rats!

Just for your general amusement:
I performed a complete removal of the Westy interior on my '87.  The 
body shop REALLY didn't want to do it so I'm trading removal time for 
detail bodywork after major body damage is repaired from previously 
mentioned accident...  took 5.5 hours of constant work.

Here's what i found...
Major mouse nest infestation in behind the cabinet area and in the 
fiberglass insulation against the body panel.  I knew I had a problem 
shortly after i bought the van but it was great to get all the old 
mouse poop out.

Westy propane tanks DO have a safety valve that limits the propane
flow to a moderate amount should the regulator or after burst or get
damaged.  With the regulator removed from the tank, i turned on the
gas (just part of curious farting around) and i could here a clank in 
a valve and the gas flow moderated.  Interesting.

The worst part of removing the interior for those contemplating it is 
the rear cabinet, at least if you have air-conditioning.  Gawd that 
was a mess.  The fridge comes out like cake.

The fan for cooling the fridge condensor is really a cheap looking 
affair.  I'm thinking of replacing or augmenting it with a 12v muffin 
fan for more air and quieter operation.  Any comments??

If anyone has questions, ask away while the surgery is still fresh in 
my mind.
