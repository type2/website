The Old Rusty Hill-&quot;Bulli&quot;
 (to the tune of the theme from the Beverly Hillbillies)

Won't you listen to my story 'bout a Bus named &quot;Red&quot;
A '63 model that had long been left for dead

Though she had a lot of windows and a roof that we call &quot;sun&quot;
Her number one problem was an old, familiar one
(Rust that is, Red Rot, Oxi-&quot;D&quot;)

When she rolled up on a trailer, and followed Hufford home
She could feel it in her bones that she was meant to roam

Soon she had a lot of suitors from as far as Canada
The one that was successful was a dude from Florida
(Kevin Murray that is, Bus Restorer, Film Maker)

Try getting *that* tune out of your head now ...
