Subject: Splittie in the Woods!

Whilst driving on my rounds today i spied a splitty sitting far back
in the woods, covered with snow.  It obviously has been parked for a
long time.  Now here's the great part...  there is so much snow on
the roof of this thang that it COULD be one of those with skylight
windows.  the anticipation of finding out is better than... well,
almost as good as certain activities. It has the swing open doors--
maybe all the splits have those, i'm really ignorant of the older
stuff.  the body looks stock and straight but it is a long way off
to see well.  

anyway, i would never have considered snooping around something like
this before my addiction to this list.  the last thing i need is a 30 
year old vehicle without a heater.  but by golly, i'm really begining 
to think splitties are cool!    :)

-dan (with babies to feed and drippy heads to fix am i being 
paternally responsible?)

ps.  it is painted a very light green on the top half and a darker 
green below-- about like a light olive drab, all very faded.  could 
that be an original color?
