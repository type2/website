&gt; Do you mean that the mounts for an 1835 are essentially the same as my 1600?  I've
&gt; been slowly renewing my bus and have until now ignored the engine aside from an
&gt; occasional touch of oil :) and periodic tuneups.

The &quot;1835&quot; engine has the same case as a 1600, just with bigger pistons and
cylinders (and a stroker crankshaft?  Damn, I can't remember!).  In other
words, the mounts would be the same.  In fact, you wouldn't even have to
get a different engine, just buy the parts and install them onto your
present engine.  I have a friend with a bug set up similar to Lee's
description (except it is around 2100cc) and it gives my Mustang a run for
it's money from 0-60.  Veeeeery impressive what you can do with a type I
motor...
