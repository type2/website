&gt; You know, I started typing something about this and then I backed it 
&gt; up.  I don't know what the exact odds are but if you get something 
&gt; like any 30 people together it is pretty hard to not find two people 
&gt; in the group with the same birthday.  Who woulda thunk?  All those 
&gt; math classes and I end up a librarian.  :(

Well I had &quot;that&quot; statistics class not too long ago, and I remember my
instructor saying something like, &quot;In a room with 35 people, the odds that
any two have the same birthday are greater than 50%&quot;.  We tried it in our
class and sure enough, there were two people that had the same birthday.
Made a believer out of me...
