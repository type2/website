Subject: '73 fuel pump removal

I know several of you have said that it's possible to remove the fuel pump on
a '73 without pulling the engine (contrary to St. Muir and Bentley).  While I
believe this to be true, I cant figure out how you'd get to the top bolt on
the pump.  None of my tools will fit up in there.  Mine was replaced with an
electric pump by the previous owner, but he left the mechanical pump on the
engine.  It drips a little oil, so I'd like to take it off someday and put a
cover plate over the hole in place of the non-functioning fuel pump.  If
anyone can tell me what kind of gizmo I need to be able to get the top bolt
off I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks
Sean Stueber
