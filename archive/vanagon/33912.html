Have you ever seen the movie &quot;Bullit&quot; with Steve McQueen?
There is the BEST chase seen ever put on film about half
way through the movie.  It takes place I guess around 66 or
67' in San Fran.  McQueen is driving a Mustang Fastback and
through his chase he passes many splitties and a number
of OLD bugs even including a oval I believe.  Check it out
for the VDubs or just for the fact that it is a great flick!
