&gt;Subject: 	Virus Warning
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;&quot; There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.  You
&gt;receive an email message with the subject line &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot;.  DO NOT read the
&gt;message, DELETE it immediately.  Please read the messages below&quot;&quot;
&gt;
&gt;---  some miscreant is sending e-mail under the title &quot;Good Times&quot;
&gt;nationwide. 
&gt;If you get anything like this, DON'T DOWN LOAD THE FILE!!!!  It has a virus
&gt;that 
&gt;rewrites your hard drive, obliterating anything on it.  Please be careful and
&gt;forward this mail to anyone you care about.
&gt;
&gt;The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of major
&gt;importance to any regular user of the Internet.  Apparently, a new computer
&gt;virus has been engineered by a user of AMERICA ON LINE that is unparalleled
&gt;in its destructive capability.  Other more well-known viruses such as
&gt;&quot;Stones&quot;  &quot;Airwolf&quot; and &quot;Michaelangelo&quot; pale in comparison to the prospects
&gt;this newest creation by a warped mentality.  What makes this virus so
&gt;terrifying, said the FCC, is the
&gt;fact that no program needs to be exchanged for a new computer to be affected
&gt;and spread through the existing email systems of the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;Once a computer is infected, one of several things can happen.  If the
&gt;computer 
&gt;contains a hard drive, that will most likely be destroyed.  If the program is
&gt;not stopped,  the computer's processor will be placed in an nth-complexity
&gt;infinite 
&gt;binary loop which can severely damage the processor if left running that way
&gt;too
&gt;long.  Unfortunately, most novice computer users will not realize what is
&gt;happening until it is far too late.  Luckily, there is one sure means of
&gt;detecting what is now known as the &quot;Good Times&quot; virus.  It always travels to
&gt;new computers the same way, in a text e-mail message with the subject line
&gt;reading &quot;Good Times&quot;. 
&gt;
&gt;Avoiding infection is easy once the file has been received simply by NOT
&gt;READING IT!  The act of loading the file into the mail servers ASCII buffer
&gt;causes the &quot;GoodTimes&quot; mainline program to initialize and execute.  The
&gt;program is highly intelligent it will send copies of itself to everyone whose
&gt;e-mail address is contained in a receive-mail file or a sent-mail file, if it
&gt;can find one.  It will then proceed to trash the computer it is running on.
&gt;
&gt;The bottom line is:  If you receive a file with the subject line &quot;Good Times&quot;
&gt;delete it immediately.  Do not read it.  Rest assured that whoever's name was
&gt;on
&gt;the &quot;From&quot; line was surely struck by the virus.  Warn your friends and local
&gt;system users of this newest threat to the Internet!  It could save them alot
&gt;of time
&gt;and money.
&gt;
&gt;PASS THIS WARNING ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW --- DO IT NOW !!!!!
