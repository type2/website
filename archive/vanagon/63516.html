Hi, anybody know of any websites w/ tent info (colors,etc?)
 I found a &quot;bus side tent&quot; but don't know what years it was from or if it
is even made by Westfalia.

brother used it w/ his VW camper...

Color - Grey w/ 2 to 3&quot; stripes made up of red, green, blue &amp; blackSide
panels (2) - 68 x 102&quot;.  Snaps on top to fit w/ roof panel.  Tie down loops
on bottom.   Roof - 54 x 99 x.  White fringe around edge.  Snaps to connect
to side panels.  Ties to attach to frame.
