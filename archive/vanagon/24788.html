&gt;Caffine! I knew it, un huh, un huh... Double Latte Mocha Fudge perhaps?
&gt;Beside you even knew who &quot;WAR&quot; was (and probably could recognize Neil Young
&gt;in an elevator). Un huh, un huh...

Yes, that old demon caffeine. My stimulant of choice these days. Say, most
illegal drugs originate in South America, so do coffee beans! Curiouser and
curiouser. Am I the only one who noticed the resemblance between Juan
Valdez and Juan Escobar?

Hmmm.....

As far as Neil Young goes, that's Mr. Young to you sir. Rust never sleeps,
suppose he was singing about VWs?
