BTW:  Since I've been a lurker for the last several months (known mostlyo
to Unca Joel and Brutha Gerry) I think I should come clean with the
list and let y'all know where I stand.  I got into VW's through my
step-dad who rebelled against his folks' Buick-oriented lifestyle.  He
went so far as to move from PA to CA to make his point, so I can now
respect him for that [since I have now reached that stage of *maturity*
where I can understand such things -- thanks, dad] .  He bought  a '80
Campmobile and took us cross-country with it.  That damn bus got vapor-lock 
in the Rockies but nonetheless made it to PA and back to CA.  The next
bus was an '83 or so with a fibreglass top, all the camper stuff, and
a CA license plate that said 'VW HAUS' (damn cool!, I'll give the man
credit for that) We took that one cross-country too, and it had that 
same shit go down in the Rockies.. )

So what was the first vehicle I got when I made it to college in
Boston?  Why a '66 VW bus of course!  the rest is history -- 

(PS: I must state that my shit-head step-dad *forced* me to learn
about the inner workings of automobiles on my own or else take
the auto mechanics course in high school (college-bound snobs
like me just didn't *do* stuff like that).  So I opted for self study 
and the man actually did right by me... )

Peace.
