Anyone know what makes the steering wheel scrape? I have the same problem
with my 86. Drives me crazy unless the radio is on! The speedometer make a
clicking noise too, but, have just been enjoying the last 4 weeks without
any mechanical problems that keep me from going down the road. (and drain
the piggy bank!) First time this has happened sense I picked it up in
February. She's running good though, thanks to you people out there in
Vanagon-land, and NO thanks to all the so called mechanics that put their
hands on her. I'm still dealing with some of the things that weren't
completed right, she leaks gas when the tank is full (although very little)
sense they (VW) performed the gas tank recall. I have to make them fix it
yet, but am really in no hurry to deal with those idiots again. Seems like
they break 2 things to fix one. The only work that was done without any
problems was done by myself, Bentley (which came in late to the picture),
all of you people. (Tonya especially, for your help with the O2 sensor, and
the clutch. And Ron for your reasonable prices on the many parts that she
needed to be road worthy again).

Thanks
