Thanks to all who gave me advice.
I'm not buying the '79 on the collective advice of all and some soul
searching.
It's hard.. I mean.. it's right there (5blocks away) and I'm right
here...  (sigh)
I'll keep looking.
Thanks for the great advice..  I bought the Muir book today. (spiral
bound..  :-) )

still searching,
Mike
