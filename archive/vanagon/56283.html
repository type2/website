I didn't see that particular white Vanagon in Virginia, but I did sight
(and talk to the driver) an official German Envoy Vanagon at the
Washington-Dullas Airport earlier this month.  The one I saw was a white,
'91 Vanagon with full length rocker panels along the sides, a head rest for
each seat, had only about 50k and an auto transmission.  Although it was a
production model for the American market, it did have German plates,
obviously, since it was an official vehicle.  Unfortunately, the driver
wasn't that impressed with it, even though he was German,  he said he liked
the American Vans better - more power.  Didn't raise the possibility of a
Subagon or Vanaru.  Besides, I was too busy admiring/envying the '91! and
concerned about missing my flight.

Also at Dullas Airport, there is a Dove Blue '88 at one of the cargo
buildings on the drive in from the rental car area.  Can't tell from the
road if it's a GL , Wolfsburg, or has everything removed for hauling stuff,
but it always gets me ready to be home driving my own Dove Blue '88 GL.

Subject:  very interesting siting

Hey all,
Today traveling down Route 17 in mid-Virginia on my way to a class, I
came upon a white Vanagon.  He was in the right lane and I was in the
left lane, preparing to pass him.  From a distance the only weird thing
I notice is that there is a yellow lamp on the roof, not flashing, just
a steady yellow lamp.  Then I get closer and see the rectangular German
license plate (with German flag on the left part of the plate) and
notice that the Vanagon has large letters &amp; numbers on the door.  I
don't remember exactly what it said, seems something like GDM-19 or
something similar, not sure exactly what the letters were.
Then I notice the trucks in front of it.  Turns out that this Vanagon is
part of a convoy of GERMAN MILITARY VEHICLES (well, a very short convoy)
that for some reason are driving through Virginia.  The military
vehicles were your typical really big trucks with canvas on the back,
trucks painted olive green and camoflauge canvas, each truck had the
rectangular German license plate.  I waved at the Vanagon driver but he
didn't wave back, maybe they don't do that in Germany :-) .
The Vanagon was a water-cooled model, I can only guess that it was
Euro-spec, it had the rectangular headlights.  I don't know what these
guys were doing here, invasion maybe? ;-)
Maybe Helmut has something to do with it ;-)
