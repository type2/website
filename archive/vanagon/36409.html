&gt; Matt,
&gt; 
&gt; There is a parts co. named Latest Rage.  They sell a bus Tow Bar for $40.  They are in Long Beach, CA.  The phone number is (310)220-1140.

I bought my Bentley from them. Great price $23 instead of $30...then 
came the $15 shipping and handling fee. OUCH! Cost them ~ $3.00 to ship 
it. I didn't read the fine print in the ad. Just be aware. 8) Joe
