The volume is probably due to the flow restrictors that the new
muffler had, which I'm going to look into replacing with normal fresh
air connectors RSN.

flow restrictors?   sounds like a great idea!

what year is the bus?    in any case the muffler should NOT vent in the
bumper like that, but under it.   can you adust the tailpipe so it points
down?   The 67 and earliers are supposed to have a pigtail tailpipe, not a
regular ell, so it clears the bumper.   is this a stock type muffler?  sounds
odd
