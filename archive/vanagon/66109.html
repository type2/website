Subject:      Firewood-aided engine removal/replacement

Hello;  While reading the current posts regarding engine installation hints
and tips, I'm reminded of my 70 single cab given to me by a friend (for
free), with a blown engine.  I bought an engine for $125 and installed it by
using a piece of firewood and an 8 foot long 2X6.  It took some
experimentation to find the proper fulcrum point for the firewood, but by
using my wife as a counter weight, I managed to get the engine into position
and get the nuts on the bottom studs and the top bolts through.  This
technique would only work with the removable apron style of type 2's, as I
later tried it on my 73 sweet pickles van and I couldn't make it work.
I ran that single cab for 40 or 50 thousand miles, until I rolled it the
third time, and the doors wouldn't open any more, then sold it to a freind
for $250.  With a little ingenuety(sp?) simple, common articles can be used
to accomplish complicated tasks.   Larry Carter
