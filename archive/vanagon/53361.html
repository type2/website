Russell,
     
     No, I bought a complete engine gasket set, VW sealents, and used
JB-Weld as well.
Early on in the project I read the archives about successes with JB-Weld and
wondered about substituting JB-Weld for VW head gasket sealent.  My head
surfaces looked pretty smooth until cleaning revealed pitting.  I applied
JB-Weld to pitting in both head and crankcase mating surfaces and carefully
fine sanded both.  

Still holding at 1000 miles... 

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

&gt;Scott, 
&gt;
&gt;     Did you really use JB-Weld instead of a head gasket?  If so, did it
&gt;work?  I am going to rebuild an 84 Vanagon engine as a winter project and am
&gt;going through the archives and saw some of your messages.
&gt;
&gt;     Might have some more questions for you later.
&gt;
&gt;     Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
