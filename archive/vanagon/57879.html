&gt;&gt; It should seem too much of an oddity.  Here in Portland, I regularly
&gt;&gt;       see EV Westfalia's on the road.  I even saw one in North Carolina
&gt;&gt;       about 4 months ago.
&gt;&gt;       I'm quite sure they are westy's and not the winnie conversion.  The
&gt;&gt;       westfalia logo on the pop top is usually pretty indicative.
&gt;&gt;       It doesn't seem incoceivable that whoever is buying them in Canada
&gt;and
&gt;&gt;       driving them across the border would sell one once in a while.  Maybe
&gt;
&gt;&gt;       even way down in PA.
&gt;
&gt;It seems highly likely that these are the 1993 (+other years?) Eurovan MV
&gt;Weekender models that came with the pop-top (by Westfalia) but without the
&gt;sink/stove stuff, and had seating for 7.
&gt;

That's exactly what they are. Definitely not full blown campers.
