Subject: gas leak-baywindow

Folks,
There is a large gas leak in my 79 bus.
The problem started out as a bad gas smell which would come and then leave.
It left for 2 days, then returned as a big gas leak.
Gas is leaking from the passenger side, right on to the cv-stub axle.
I just pulled the firewall to get a good look at the gas tank, but nothing
looked obviously wrong.
The rubber filler hose going directly in the tank is worn, and I will replace
it, but it is not wet.  Other parts under the vehicle are wet, though.

This leads me to believe there is a problem on the underside of the tank.
BTW, all the fuel line under the vehicle was replaced recently.

Anyone have the underside of their tank rust out??  Or, have it rust out
and not know it until you pulled the whole tank out??
That silver insulation under the tank is all wet at the moment, just on the
passenger side.  The leak is significant, like 2+ gallons.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated

Paul
