Subject: Signoff

I need to sign off this list for awhile in order to get several job projects
off my desk.  I have found much on this list fascinating...maybe too
fascinating...and have rework job and hobby priorities.  I do want to thank
all (particularly Joel Walker and Tim Smith) who have assisted with my
various van problems and hope I have helped with some of yours.

I plan to resubscribe, although I do need to get another mailbox to keep the
list mail separate from the rest.  In the meantime, anyone is welcome to add
my address to their file and cc: me on any problems relating to mid 80's
watercooled vans.  I will be very happy to share whatever ignorance I may have.
