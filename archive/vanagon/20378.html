Subject: Another find!!


Howdy bus peoples!

Well after several weeks of tracking down the owners I finally came up
with another Westy (anybody want to buy a rusty 65?). It was one of
those I know somebody who knows sombody who has one of them old busses
kinda story. It turns out that the owner past away and left it to his
grandson, he had no idea what year it was but he thought it was a
camper(YES!)and it had been sitting for a long time.
Last night I hooked up with him and went to check it out, here it's in
the basement of this old block store,(i'm thinking damp and rusty at
this point!)
he fights with the door,finally gets it open, only for me to see furniture!??
So we go wading thru all these old tables and stuff and I see the rear
of it, Roof rack(YES)!,plate expired 3/75, but what about these backup
lights??? popped the engine lid, hmm, 12 volt battery... I go around the
front, She's a splitty- 67!!!, pop top, complete interior and very
minimum rust, considering we're talkin' Western PA. here.
Well I asked him what he would take for it and he decided $400. it's a deal!

Sorry about all this bandwidth but I had had to tell somebody, I got
home grinning like some little kid, tell the wife about it... her reply-
&quot;Oh goodie, another one&quot;. Hopefully someday she'll understand...

Still smilin'
R.J.
