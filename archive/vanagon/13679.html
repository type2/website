Subject: Stripped my Side View Mirror Bolt

What are my choices?  Finding a replacement at a junkyard or
buying a new one?

Anyway, I was tightening one of my side view mirrors and I heard
a 'pop' when I noticed that the nut slid up the bolt and stripped
it.  I had soaked the nut and bolt over night w/ WD40 due to
being corroded.  I believe the spring was tight and wouldn't
tighten up so the threads on the bolt gave in.  Any other options?

-Scott.
