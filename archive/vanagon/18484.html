&gt; Fired up the grill and relaxed, taking in the VW ambience. The view from my spot
&gt; was incredible! Directy behind me, a forest green '59 Single cab. Next to it, a
&gt; two-toned blue '86 (?) Crew cab fron Ontario. Further down, a wonderful
&gt; red/white 1960's crew cab. Life was good. Threw several burgers on the grill,
&gt; and sat back with a few cold ones. During the course of the day, met listmembers
&gt; Pete Krough, Chris Chubb, Bill Killian &amp; Wife &amp; baby. Ran into
&gt; many-non-listmember VW friends, also. Went home at about 4:30 pm-wet and tired.

We met Tom there and we also met the owner of the '86 crew cab.  He had 
it parked next to his '87 Brazilian Crew Cab.  That is a 1987 Brazilian 
air cooled bay window double cab pickup - and he was selling it!  Both of 
the crew cabs were tagged from Pennsylvania.  The night before the show I 
saw his two pickups and parked my Eurovan right beside them - a T2, T3 and 
T4 all side by side.  COOL!  Really wish a split window bus had 
wandered by at that moment.  Of course I can't remember his name dagnabbit.

HE told me REALLY interesting things about the coming Porsche-VW V6 in 
the next VW Van.  He works at a dealer in PA.  If this stuff he was 
telling me wasn't BS we may all want one of these next vans.  He also 
told me the reason VW doesn't sell pickups in the US is import 
restrictions.  He claimed that the Japanese do at least 'final assembly' 
- that is they bolt on the bed in the US to get around the restrictions.  
VW will stop selling the pickups in Canada because the NAFTA restrictions 
put the US restrictions on trucks sold in Canada.  If this bit is true it 
REALLY sucks.
