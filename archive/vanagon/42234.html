Subject: '72-'74 carb? anyone with one of these please go look.

Hi all;
	I just recieved a nice looking set of carbs from Thom.  they are 
stock solex but I can't determine the year.  Problem is that they have 
some electrical stuff on em that my stock '72 does not have.  on my '72 
there are two solenoids and a plate that says solex on it, all of which 
have electrical connections.  that part is the same on these so I won't 
have any problem with that bit of wiring.  However, the left hand carb 
has this silver, rectangular,  thingy for lack of a better term mounted 
to the upper left side of the left hand carb (when viewed from the back 
of the bus) it has an electrical connection on it and I don't know what 
to hook it to.
	My other problem is gasketts.  these carbs seem to be in good 
shape and I don't want to rebuild but I will probably need the 
manifold/carb gasket.  I really don't want to pay $22 for the set if I 
only need the two.  Is there any kind of high temp material that works 
well?  
thanks for any Info.
Ed.
