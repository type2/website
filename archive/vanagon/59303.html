Subject: Re: Gas in oil? UPDATE

&gt; I can hear and feel gas running through the fuel lines, apparently going
&gt; into the pistons.  When I disconnect the AFM, the fuel stops running. 
&gt; It will idle fine with the AFM disconnected, but of course will not
&gt; drive that way.  I have pretty much decided that the AFM is bad (has an
&gt; intermittant problem, since it only does it after driving a while 5-10
&gt; minutes) and I need to replace it.  Does anyone have any experience with
&gt; this?  Do you think I'm on the right track?  Thanks!

Chaz,
I don't think the AFM is necessarily bad.  It is true that the fuel pump
should NOT be running with the key &quot;on&quot; and the engine off.  Make sure
the flap in the AFM is closing completely.  Also, pop that cover off the
AFM again.  Look on the right side and you will see a set of contacts
that the AFM flap doohickey opens when the flap is fully closed and
close when the flap opens.  You may simply need to bend the contact so
that they are open when the flap is closed.  Those contacts supply the
fuel pump with 12v when the engine is running but are supposed to cut
power to the pump when the engine stops.  

In addition, even though the fuel pump is running, fuel should not be
injected into the cylinders.  The fuel injectors only fire when the ECU
grounds them.  So, you need to pull your injectors and test for leaks,
I'm betting you have leaky injectors or a leaky cold start valve.  The
maximum leakage specification is in the Bentley manual.
