&gt;I have concluded after closer examination of the oil I drained from the

&gt;aluminum particles.  Aluminum, because none have attached themselves to
&gt;my magnetic drain plug.
&gt;Now, wouldn't that exclude rods or bearings from being suspect?

aluminum???? well ... that definitely ain't rods or bearings. but it could
be the case. :(  you said you put a heavy flow oil pump ... any chance it's
cutting into the case??? that would also make a helluva noise.
