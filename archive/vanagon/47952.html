Schponfirkle ...

&gt;I am curious if there are those out there with Eurovan and how they are
&gt;faring?

111,000 miles ... abused, tormented, run down, run up, neglected, unserviced
(for 10,000 miles now), with rapidly-balding tyres and due for its first
official government safety check at the end of this month.

My 1.9L diesel T4 panel van is goin' great.  Five years old and dented to
hell.  What a great van!  How else could I deliver washing machines and
fridges all over the place?

:)  Happy, happy, joy, joy.
