Subject: re: Vanagon rotors in Canada

&gt;&gt;JC Whitney has Vgon rotors for $49.98 (early) or $52.98 (late)
&gt;&gt;apiece, or around $100/pair plus shipping. Not for Syncro, tho-- was
&gt;&gt;yours a Syncro or a 2WD Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;        It's a 2wd 83 Westie. Is JC Whiyney a US thing or is it
&gt;        Canada to?
&gt;I havent heard of them before, but then again I havent had a need for
&gt;auto stuff before : )

Didn't catch the location of the original list member, but in BC, 
BowWow parts usually stocks them with decent prices. They're in 
Surrey, Victoria 604-381-4331 &amp; Kelowna.
