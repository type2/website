Chris Bridge asks about quality engine rebuild kits.  Yesterday, in my
quest for the ultimate source for reliable power, I compared prices for
(comparable) items from both Bugpack and Gene Berg. I found no
*significant* difference; for some parts, Berg was actually cheaper. Take
for example the &quot;Race Rods&quot; from Bugpack, which are described as good
copies of Carillo rods. Bugpack sells a set for $585. Berg sells them too,
reworked and balanced, for $522.50 (cash price).

This is just an impression I got from a casual glance. For all I know,
there could be additional charges for the rod bolts; I'm not sure. Usual
disclaimer applies: I'm not affiliated with any....(blablabla).
