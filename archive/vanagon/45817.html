&gt; Hey!  My friend loves her 412!!  :)
&gt; -Ron SalmonI owned a couple of 411s and 2 412s a few years ago.. I loved them, cause 
nobody else would! ;-)  Personally, I feel the 411/412 series was an 
incredibly under-rated Vee Wee.  Standard gas heaters, better ride than a 
bug, and pretty quick when mated to a 4-speed.  (I was lucky to get a couple 
of those.)  Most of the time you got the automatic, which was a real dog.   
Sorry 'bout the non-bus content...but hey...the 411...type 4 motor=bus motor!
