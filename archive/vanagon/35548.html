Okay here she goes.

Just sit right back and you'll here a tale.
A tale of a fate-ful trip......

Well, not exactly.  Thom and I arranged to meet in the morning
of Sat. the seventeenth, Ninteen-hundred and Ninty-six.  The night
before I stopped on my way home from work to pick up a 12V battery,
some oil and some gas treatment.  I looked for wiper blades, but
that was a joke at Manny, Moe &amp; Jacks.  Got this stuff home and
piled it on the garage floor so it'd be in one place ready to go.

I tried calling Thom to pin-point the actual time we were going,
but he was on his computer for most of the night as far as I could
tell.  So I went to bed thinking I'd probably wake up early enough
to be ready for his arrival.

Next morning I got up about 6AM and took care of some minor chores
(empty the dishwasher and fill with dirty ones) and watched last 
nights video taped X-Files.  Just after the shows concluded, Thom
showed up as I was bring out the 5 gal. gas can.  We loaded up the
stuff I'd bought and I said my good-byes to my wife as she was 
still snoozing and we took off.

We stopped for some cash in anticipation of buying some spare gates
for the pickup.  Got some eats at MacGrubs and headed down Highway
Fifty to Highway Ninty-Nine.  We cruised along in Thom's beautiful
'56 and Thom related how the cops were patrolling Ninty-Nine quite
a bit lately and how he'd seen many cars pulled over that week.
He also pointed out where his work 'Alldata' was located on the
way.

We got to our exit got some gas and tootled on down the country 
road and got to our destination.  Benji was their getting the last 
of his stuff loaded in a hugh semi trailer as he was in the process 
of moving.

I saw that the pickup hadn't moved since I last saw it and new
that we were going to be installing the engine.  Benj had previously
kept saying that he'd have it in by then.  Yeah right.  So we
got the truck backed up and half-way into his mostly empty 
garage and Thom took immediate command of the situation.  This
was really cool, because I would have taken alot more time in
getting in gear to get things started.  He had the engine on
a floor jack and up in the engine bay in no time.  Mating the
engine to the tranny was a little bit tricky.  But with a second
pair of eyes (Benji's) The job got done in short order.  

As Thom made himself at home under the truck,  I was mostly trying
to find the right bolt, nut or screw which usually meant fetching
it out of one of the parts cars sitting outside.  And they weren't
always readily available.

Thom got the 17mm bolts on the the four studs and the engine and
tranny were one.

The next step was getting the accelerator cable up and through
the dog-house fan housing.  Thom futzed with it a bit and was
unable to get it though the opening.  I tried reaching around,
but couldn't find the hole passed the prodruding metal where 
the oil-cooler resides.  Benji saw that we didn't have the little
metal tube that guides the accelorator cable through the housing
and pushed it through.  That made it easier at Thom's end and 
the cable was through.  I think Benji hunted down a barrel clamp
and the cable was connected to the carburetor linkage.  

I went and got the battery while Thom started on the cables.
When I got back he had the positive cable set on the starter but
the ground cable was gone.  I went and pulled another off one
of the sacrifice vehicles.  I cleaned up both end of the cable
with a cable cleaner from Benji and put the large coupling on
the battery.  Then I had to hunt down another bolt to secure
the other end.

Thom messed with the fuel line and after some confusion about
which tube it connected, it was hooked up and done.

Then came the clutch cable adjustment.  Thom asked me to push the 
pedal.  I did that and it went all the way to the floor.
So Thom started turning the wing-nut on the cable but after many
turns, the pedal was not much better.   I know he was doing 
alot of inspecting at that end, but I couldn't see what exactly
he was looking at.  I offered to do some turning myself as I
know that job is kind of a pain and awkward.  But to my dismay,
I *could not* get my hand in a position to turn the wing nut
even with a screw driver.  This really concerns me as I have
to be able to do this so I can adjust it myself.  I could not
figure out how Thom could fit is bigger hand in there.  Well,
he got under there and tried turning it some more but the wing
nut wouldn't budge.  As it turned out the threads were rough
and needed to be re-threaded.  So Benji supplied a cutting tool
and Thom did the job carefully and did what looked like a 
super job.  The threads were clean and shiny and with some
WD-40 the wing-nut went on much better.  But....  the cable
was a bit too long.  He ended up putting some shims on the cable
housing (bowden tube) adjusted the tranny arm a bit and we got
the pedal adjusted.

After looking around for an elusive self-tapping screw (hard
to believe, eh?) we got the voltage regulator connected up.

Okay, so next was the starter to battery connection.  Thom 
scrooched over and connected the battery cable and then had
me turn the key.  Nothing.  He did the old screwdriver across
the starter studs thing and it turned over.  But it wouldn't
start.  There was some confusion and discussion with Benji
about what wires go where which got straightened out.
Thom tried again to start the motor, but someone mentioned gas 
and he said he thought he could smell it in the tank, but 
Benj said we'd better add some more.  

So I grabbed the 5 gallon can from the '56 and poured in about
a gallon of the essence.  Thom tried again and after a few
turns it kicked over and 'viola!'  That beautiful VW sound we
all love to hear.  I pushed the trottle a few times and let it
run a bit.  Ahhhhh sweet music.  While it was running, Thom
monkeyed with the muffler a bit which made the sound legit., 
but took it off for later mounting.  

At that point, we had to get some brake fluid as Benji had none 
and so we headed to a local market and got some lunch and almost
forgot to get the brake fluid!  DOH!!!  

I bought 3 small bottles of brake fluid and we headed on back
munching on our lunch and talking on the way.  

When we got back, we started on the brakes.  They just needed
bleeding.  Thom rolled under again and I filled the reservoir
with brake fluid.  Thom had me pumping the pedal to build up
pressure.  It took a while but it slowly got there.  He bled
the first cylinder and that got the pressure up some more.
He had trouble with the second cylinder as the nipple would
not move much but he got it to let out some fluid.  So I 
pressed real hard on the pedal.  After doing that one for a
bit, he couldn't get the nipple down tight all the way and it 
leaked a little.  I knew that was okay and could replace
the cylinder later.  If that cylinder was having trouble re-
leasing the nipple, then that meant I needed to have a look 
at the front brake drums anyway.  We got the other two wheels 
done with no hinderence other than I had to add more fluid as 
we went.

I don't know why, but I was really klutzy getting the damn
fluid to go in the reservoir.  Thom almost got it in the
face!  I stopped just in time and told him to get his head
out of there.  

Back to the starter/switch.  There was a button on the dash
that I suspected was to by-pass the started switch, but Thom 
thought it might be to by-pass the horn button.  So Thom 
rolled under and tested a few wires at the starter after a
few tries, the ignition switch turned over the motor.  Hooray!!

Well, finally it came time to give it a short test drive.  So
I climbed into the driver seat and turned it over.  I put it 
in second as Thom suggested and killed it.  Doh!!  Started 
again and gave it some more gas and eased it into second.  
It rolled along and I popped it out of gear and checked the
brake action.  I still took a few panic-pumps, but I felt it'd
be okay.  I tried it in first, but each time it would stall.
Reverse worked okay but kept popping out.  I turned around
a brought it back.  Then Thom tried it himself and found the
same problems.  We thought it was the tranny, but Benji was
adament that it was not the tranny and probably the linkage. 
Benji took it for a drive and we stood their hearing it popping
out of various gears as he drove the circuitous route.  When
he came back, he was complaining about the linkage and Thom
and he tore into the shifter with me thinking about getting
the beast home and hoping my wife wasn't angry or worried 
about how late I was.

I gave her a couple of calls to re-assure her, but one time
she must have been on the computer and the other the recorder
was on so I figured she must be out running an errand.

Well after Thom and Benji fiddled around and decided that a
plastic coupling was the culprit, they put the linkage back
together in the best way they could and chaulked it up to
another fun job I'd have in store for me.  

I don't know what they did, but it sure did shift alot better
after their work.  It engaged first like it should and reverse
didn't pop, so I was happy.  

Well, that was about it except we wanted it to look legitimate
on the highway, so we grabbed the front lights and put them on.
Monkeyed around with the front signal lenses.  Benji through in
a pair of Euro rear lenses, but they didn't fit right.  Thom
'McGuyvered' them on and now it looked suitable for the road. 

Oh, one more thing.  Gas.  Well, as it turned out, the 5 gal
gas can I'd left aside was used by some other guy that had 
been there to do some car work of his own.  Apparently Benji
had pointed in the direction of his own gas cans and told
this kid that he could use that.  He mistakenly used mine
instead.  Needless to say, I was none too pleased about my
4 gallons of premium being used up and taken like that.  Well
the kid was gone and there was nothing I could do but use what
Benji had.  I poured it in and Thom and I were ready to depart.

I got the paper work from Benji and gave him the $1300 cashiers
check.  I declined to buy the extra set of gates as they were
not in good enough shape to warrant $300.  So Thom and I left
except Thom had to McGuyver the driver side door so that it
would stay closed.  This consisted of a small portion of a 
hose wedged in on top of the latch so it would be pushed down
on the catch and not release.

We headed out and I was not exactly pleased with the acceleration
once in third gear, but it slowly crept up and finally into
forth.  I couldn't really hear the engine well because of wind
noise.  So I had to use the red marks on the speedo.  I figured
the slow acceloration was due to crummy gas and that the timing
and dwell weren't exactly right.  That's okay, I could get it 
home.

So on we went with my top speed about 49 - 50 mph with occasional
slow downs which I attributed to bad gas.  As we moved along many
cars passed.  I didn't look at them as I knew they probably hated
me for going so slow.  Too bad.  After many miles we finally got
to the gas station where I put about 8.5 gallons of premium in
the tank.  When I got back in the darn driver door popped open
after I shut the passenger door.  Thom came over and re-did the
McGuyver job and off we went.  The acceleration change was obvious.
I was able to get up to 55mph and could have done 60mph but wanted
to be conservative on the engine.  We barreled along nicely and
everything was groovy until we came up on this bozo doing no more
than thirty in a cadillac pulling an old trailer.  What a yutz!
I had to slow way down and what for quite a bit of traffic to 
go buy.  Thom finally waved me to pull out.  I saw a semi coming
but Thom pulled out before me so I went for it.  We got by the
caddy-bozo and pulled back over.  I'm sure we slowed the semi
down in the process.  I hope he wasn't too mad at us.  

Not far after passing aforementioned bozo I wanted to get off at 
Grantline road to take the back way.  As I was pulling off the
driver door came loose and I had to juggle the gear shift, steering
wheel and hold the door at the same time.  Yikes!  Just like James
Bond I was able to manuver the truck to a safe stop (although the
spot I stopped was a little tight for letting cars go by.  

Well there I was with my McGuyver gasket gone and now we had to 
figure a way to keep the door closed.  We tried the short rope
that was used to secure it before only we wanted it to look in-
conspicuous.  So we first tried tying the rope to the inside 
door opener and the steering column.  This didn't work as the
rope would slip up the handle.  Next we took off the door up
holstery and tried the rope around the frame and to the column.
This didn't work because we couldn't cinch the rope tight enough.
Finally Thom went back and got a strap used to hold grocerys 
and stuff in place for vans and stationwagons.  He cliped one
end to the driver side door frame and the other to the passenger
window opening in the top of the door and made it real snug.
This worked great other than it kind of obstructed me reach
to the gear shifter, but it was okay.  

So on we went.  Down Grantline and up Bradshaw and to my
house.  All-in-all I thinkg it went pretty well thanks to Thoms
innovative and hard work.  Thanks again Thom!!  I'm sure I
will be able to return the favor in the future.  

As Thom mentioned, it was my birthday and so I had to get ready
real quick as Linda and I had a reservation for dinner in Placer-
ville that evening.  We had a lovely dinner and uh... well that's
none of your business!!  ;)
