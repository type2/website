Subject: &quot;Tundra Toaster&quot; heater II 

More data for those who care, this is the ONLY NON-VENTED propane heater 
available, yes, non-vented.  The claim is 97% efficiency keeps water vapour 
to 'zero'  (since I always thought it was a main product of propane burning 
I don't really believe it, chemists?) To heat a van/tent the rep. said to 
run a 4&quot; flexi pipe in through the window, and keep the heat setting low.  
He gave me the name of a company using them indoors to dry drywall/plaster 
so... it must be very low on water vapour output. Must check!  COx ???  
Current draw is 5.7amps/12V 6-7hrs on the battery. Flame-detect and overheat 
and airflow sensors which will cut off propane if probs. occur, including 
low battery/loss of airflow.  Seems safe enough. The cooking attachment is 
$60, oil pan heater $52.  Boils large pan of water in 12 minutes.  Temp 
range is 100-700 fahrenheit! not C, my typo.
A possible loaf install would be to remove the spare tire well and put in an 
access door, then reach down to turn it on? Maybe blast doors like on those 
missle silos?
