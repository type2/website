Subject: Volks-Motorsports &amp; Syncro air filter


Wow!  Kyle must have escorted my package of parts up here personally.  I 
called him Friday afternoon to order some bumper end caps and the 
super-special Syncro air filter, and a box was on my doorstep when I went 
home on Monday.  Kyle, you should have stuck around until I got there!  
But I'm sure your're a busy man.  

I can't ever figure out the post office.  That was the best service I've 
gotten from them in a while.  Most of my mail comes from the east coast.  
Once, a box of cupcakes sent via their 2 lbs, $2.98, 2-3 days method took 
NINE DAYS to get here.  I cursed the post office, and ate them in one 
sitting.  

The Syncro air filter is a work of art.  I'm so glad I bought two of 
them, because the spare is going to sit on my coffee table looking cool 
for weeks.  Or until Alina gets back from her field work.

Thanks for the great service, Kyle, and give me a shout next time you're 
in Fairbanks...
