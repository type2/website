So snuggles_at_vnet.ibm_dot_com says:
&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; while down at my folks house way out in the country, i found  a junk yard with
&gt; a bunch of vw bugs and a couple of buses. the bugs look to be in reasonable
&gt; shape...what i want to know is will the heater boxes of a early 70's bug fit a
&gt; '74 transporter? the guy is gonna crush these bugs sometime in late january if
&gt; i don't get back to him soon. i didn't crawl under them cuz i didn't have my
&gt; work clothes on but they look to be in decent shape with little rust. let me
&gt; know....i may be able to get tie rods, cv joints, heater boxes, and other
&gt; parts. the guy said he basically just wants to get rid of them cuz they are
&gt; taking up space.
&gt; 
Unless your '74 has a Type I engine, I can't see any way that heater box 
will fit your Type IV engine.  A completely different exhaust manifold
is  the main difference.  On the Type I, the manifold attaches to the 
front and rear of the head.  The manifold attaches to the bottom on the 
Type IV engine.  

Really sad to read about places crushing perfectly good restorables. :(
