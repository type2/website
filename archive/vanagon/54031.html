Subject: Mud flap

I just bought a 89 Westy a couple of months ago.  I have
it stored for the winter while I do some minor work on it.

I noticed that there is a mud flap on the drivers side front
wheel, but there is none on the passengers side.  There isn't
even any bracket!  Is this normal?  My theory is that because
the valves are on the drivers side, the mud flap prevents stones
and mud from flying up and hitting the valve covers.

Any ideas?
