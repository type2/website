Subject: Jerome Jamboree this weekend (AZ,USA)

Don't forget about the Arizona Bus Club's Annual Jerome Jamboree that will
be held this weekend. Caravan starting on Saturday at 07:00 from I-17 and
the Greenway Rd. interchange. Meet at the HOME DEPOT parking lot. If you
choose not to caravan with the gang you can always meet in the town of
Jerome, AZ and ask the locals where the old mining camp tourist trap place
is. That be the spot. It should be alot of fun. Chili contest and prize
raffle including a splittie bus to be raffled off! Overnight camping is
encouraged but a day visit either Saturday or early Sunday would work also.
*Sorry Martha, no magnesium fires will be allowed this year. The U.S. Forest
Service and local fire department kinda frowns on range fires.* Dress for
sun, fun, and prepare for anything. =)

Call Jon Stanton for details (602) 877-8662
