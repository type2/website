Subject:      CCC update for this weekend

This weekend's trip has been changed.  We're now going to Edison Lake in
the Sierra National Forest.  (We learned that the previous choice was
infested with blackflies.)
This new campground features beautiful alpine lakes, hiking, fishing, and
cool night air. There are also pit toilets and running water.=20

The campground is located approximately 80 miles east of Fresno off of
State Highway 168.

The cost is $12 / night. The culinary theme is 'food from your own ethnic
heritage'.

Directions from Fresno / Clovis=20

   =95 Take State Highway 168 East. 168 is a 2 and 4 lane highway of
     slight to moderate grade with a few switchbacks. The road goes
     from Fresno to the 7000 ft. level at Huntington Lake.=20

   =95 Continue Past Shaver Lake (approx. 60 miles from Fresno)=20

   =95 Continue for approximately 25 miles to Huntington Lake

   =95 Check for a posting from CCC at the Eastwood Ranger Station,
     at Kaiser Pass Road on East Side of Rt. 168, 200 yds. past
     the entrance to Rancheria Campground. The ranger station is
     at the extreme East end of Huntington Lake by a small
     hydro-electric plant.=20

     If you're the first to arrive, you should check in at the
     ranger office. The ranger will call up to Edison / Florence
     lakes and let us know which campsites are open. The first
     camper should post the camp location outside the station for
     following CCCers.=20

     Our first choice is &quot;Vermillion Campground&quot; at Edison Lake.
     It has running water, pit toilets, and multiple glacial lakes
     a short hike away. This campsite is not usually filled. If
     the ranger finds this full, our second choice should be
     &quot;Jackass Meadow Campground&quot; at Florence Lake. This campsite
     has pit toilets but no water, and is rarely filled on
     weekends. Our third choice is anything else.=20

   =95 Take Kaiser Pass Road (over 10,000 ft pass) to the lakes.
     Edison (2nd choice Florence) lakes are approx. 20 miles
     past the Rt. 168 turnoff. The road is one lane in many
     areas and goes along a shear cliff with no guardrail.
     Because you may have to stop and backup for other
     traffic, the road to Edison lake may take up to 2 hours
     to travel.=20

Looking forward to seeing you there!
