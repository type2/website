&gt;         Yeow! Sounds like crapolah to me... Mine is a screw in as well,
&gt; minus the adapters, and was around $20, as I said. I would agree that the
&gt; rubber plug one is junk, sight unseen. The design just plain *sounds*
&gt; crappy.

I've been lurking on this thread for awhile now and just have to take 
exception to this last little bit.  I have one of these that works just 
dandy on my Rabbit.  So long as there's plenty of clearance around the 
spark plug hole they work fine.  It's when you have to try and drop it 
down the hole made by the tin or come up with some kind of adapter that 
they don't work worth a damn.
