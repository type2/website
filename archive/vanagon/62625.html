Subject: RE: BRAKES FOR E VANS

I replaced pads a while back. Austin Vee Dub could find only the OEM type for 
about $80 as I remember. Try Ron at the Bus Depot (on the list).

I think rotors are replaced/remachined much more than is really needed - good 
source of income for shops. If the surfaces aren't too uneven careful brake-in 
 makes the pads conform well in a short time. But do wear them in before you 
have to depend on a quick stop.

  Has any E VAN owners replaced the front brakes yet? Are there any
aftermarket sources for pads and rotors? I'm down to the nubs on mine and the
dealers price of over $350 is way out there.    Thanks  SPENCER
