By control module do you mean the igniter or the computer module? I
have been told that the igniter either  works or it doesn't (they run
under 80 at a VW shop). The computer module(so I am told) rarely
fails. I had a similar problem in that after high speed driving the
engine would just die and take a few minutes to restart. They traced
the problem to two things: a faulty idle stabilizer and a collapsed
hose running from the aux. air regulator to the bellows. The latter so
I am told will prevent the engine from getting the proper air mixture
leading to stalling. If you feel handy and confident, check first that
all intake related hoses including vacuum hoses and the intake bellows
are sufficiently flexible and sealed. This is vital. Then try running
the engine bypassing the idle stabilizer (by attaching the two ends
together). Check that all your electrical connections are solid and
are making a good connection-scrape away any veneer for a good metal
to metal contact. Finally check your distributor cap and rotor for
soundness - ie minute cracks, blackened connections. etc. Before you
do anything buy a manual - Bentley's is the best but expensive and
good luck. DC
