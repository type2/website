&gt;  You need a voltage doubler circuit (not cheap) or a DC to DC converter(not

&gt; each- 6 and 12.  I don't think you'll like either of these.  can you get 
&gt; deep cycle 6 volt batteries?

Absolutely.  They are called Golf-cart batteries, and I'm gonna get me
some reeeeel soon now.  Anyone wanna buy a 12V deep-cycle marine battery?  =)
