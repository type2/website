Subject: Nosehoseheater. partly humorous.

Hi all VWtourists

Went out for the second time in my transporter fitted with a bunk. No
heating, kichen and all that stuff. Day was warm (22=B0 celsius that is,)=

though nights were chilly (2-7=B0. (Zero is frost)) So I crept into my
sleeping bag and was warm and cosy until I noted that my nose was cold.
Simply breathing cooled it down to about 12=B0C and I could not go to
sleep with a nose feeling like the inside of a freezer. =


I considered a rebuild of the VW implying a connection from the
watersystem to a small heater to attach to the nose. Water was still
warm. But I did not have the tools, and besides it was dark night. =


Then I took a sock and wound it around my nose. (I have a fairly big
nose). It worked in the sense, that it made it warmer, but it prevented
me from breathing, - or more correct - it took away the pleasure of it,
should I say. (I decided in the future to reduce the time I wear the
same socks to no more than three weeks...)
Then I let the engine on idle, and put my nose into the exhaust pipe. It
got stuck there, and the engine stopped because the exhaust system was
blocked. I also remembered that if you die from this, your face will
look like a cherry, so I gave it up.
Fourth try worked. I put my nose close to the sleepingbag, so the heat
of the exhaust (of the nostrils) coul=7Fd be recycled. Now the air was no=
t
so fresh, but after a while my nose got nice and warm, and it stayed
that way all night. =


This piece of advice is to be used for free by anyone suffering from
cold noses in watercooled VWvanagons.

Have fun!
