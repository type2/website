Hey all,
Today while browsing in an antiques store here in Fredericksburg VA, I
came across a Matchbox VW Bus from 1970.  It's made in England and t
so it has right hand drive.  But guess what!  It's a Dormobile, with an
orange roof that really tilts! :)  Pretty neat.  It's a dark blue
camper.

They also had a red Type III Fastback with opening doors :)

Sean
