Subject: Re: 87 Vanagon- Antifreeze smell

&gt; 
&gt; Every time I use the rear auxiliary heater (under the rear bench seat) in my 
&gt; van, I smell antifreeze!  I recently removed the rear seat to gain access 
&gt; the heater core and let the van idle for an hour or so and couldn't see any 
&gt; leaks or indication of leaks...   The antifreeze level has slightly dropped 
&gt; over the last couple of months (approx 0.25 inch in the overflow tank).
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  Have any ideas?
&gt; 
Mine leaked when I got it, although it was fairly easy to see the 
coolant once removing the box over the heater (mine's a Westy, not 
sure what passenger vans have). First the valve was replaced, but it 
still leaked. Removal of the plastic front &quot;grill&quot; (held on by clips) 
revealed a white crusty deposit on the fins of the core. A small leak 
may evaporate in the air flow before it starts to drip, which would 
still produce the smell.

Luckily the dealer paid for the parts - the core was around $150 Cdn 
I think.
