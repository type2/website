Subject: rust in air intake louvres '71

I'm going to do some rust-busting soon on my '71 bus. Inspecting the
vehicle, I found rust spots on the *inside* of the air intake louvres. Now,
before applying anti-rust stuff, you have to wash the area and wire-brush
the rust away. How can I do that in this location? Can I safely hose down
the inside of these louvres? Where will all the rust flakes and general crap
and water go? Won't it all get sucked into somewhere it shouldn't be?

If anyone has dealt with rust in this esoteric location, I'd appreciate any
advice.

Thanks.
