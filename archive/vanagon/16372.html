Subject: Re: towing

i have heard that towing it with a tow bar is fairly cheap and minimal
hassle. however if the tires are old and the wheels are locked it might be
easier putting it on a triple axle trailer. the old busses like to
blowaround quite a bit because they don't have steering locks. if you are
going to tow the van with the back wheels raised and the front on the
ground i would suggest tying the steering wheel so that the double cab
doesn't wander so much
