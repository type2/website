Hi Volks,
  Just a reminder, #Volkswagen will be open this Friday on US Undernet
around 8pm est. It'll say on as long as people want to talk.  Hope to see
you there.  We had a great time last month!

Some asked me why I chose the Undernet?  Well, I like the fact that it
automatically hooks you up the first available server.  There is reduced
lag time. I've noticed on the Efnet that some servers have huge lag times.
If I want to change servers with Efnet, to find one with reduced lag time,
I have to get into my start up prefferences and change it by hand.  There
may seem to be alot of different servers with Efnet, but I noticed most are
only available to authorized users.  Anyway, why I like US Undernet.  Hope
to talk to you this Friday. Take care.
