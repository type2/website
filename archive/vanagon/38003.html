Subject: Gas gauge readings


The gas gauge on the '80 V6anagon has always given strange readings.
When I fill it up until the gas station pump clicks off, and then
top it a few times to make doubly sure, the gauge still never rises higher
than 3/4 full. OTOH, I have run it out of gas twice now, showing me that
when it's on Empty, that reading really IS accurate  :-\  .

Had this problem on a Datsun once, and the problem turned out to be
dirty/corroded contacts on the wire where it attached to the tab on
the tank float sensor. It was fairly easy to get to in the Datsun,
but I haven't even figured out where the tank is on an '80 Vanagon,
much less the electrical attachment for the float sensor.

Can anyone give me a clue on:

1.) Where's the d*mned tank,
2.) How do I get to the electrical connector on the float sensor,
3.) Has anyone has this problem on a Vanagon, who might be able to
    suggest a possible cause (sticky float? Gauge problem? etc.)?
