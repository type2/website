i would buy it.  if you can't fix it it sounds like it has enough parts 
to make it worth while.

&gt; Found another bus to contemplate this weekend...
&gt; 
&gt; Its a '61 double door kombi kamper (can you say that 5 times fast?)
&gt; 
&gt; Bad:  Wheel wells cut out, wrong taillights, nose bashed in.  Misc &amp; sundry
&gt;       dents.  Front floors have some rust, can't see cargo floor (see 
&gt;       under heading &quot;good&quot;)
&gt; 
&gt; Good: Its a double door, only 1 piece of glass is missing, not too rusty,
&gt;       comes chock full of parts. (bumpers, engineparts, etc)  Really
&gt;       full.  To the gills!
&gt; 
&gt; He was asking $400, would prolly take $200
&gt; 
&gt; Whaddaya think?
