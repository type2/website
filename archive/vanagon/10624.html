Subject:      Extended Use Report  1983 Vanagon Camper 36,000 miles

Extended-Use Report: Volkswagen Vanagon Camper at 36,000 miles
Road &amp; Track, April 1985

The Turtle, we have discovered, has it made. For 36,000 miles we have
had a turtle-like green Volkswagen Vanagon camper in our long-term
fleet and it has demonstrated that when you can take it with you, you
take it everywhere.

That 36,000 miles has been accumulated in only 16 months, testimony to
the popularity of the Vanagon cmaper. Our staff has used the Volkswagen
to camp in the mountains of the Sierra Nevadas, to camp by the
temporary race track of Eloy, Arizona, and even once in the parking lot
of a Volkswagen dealer where it was towed after the engine blew up.
But that's geting ahead of our story.

Volkswagen's van has always been a charmer, with barn-like room, a
suspension suitable for off-road exploring and economy like, well, like
a Volkswagen. Tempering those qualities used to be deafening noise,
tractor-like speed and handling that often made a person glad there was
no more speed. A long history of improvements has resulted in the
current Vanagon that has an acceptably powerful and quiet liquid-cooled
engine pushing a well behaved and still charming warehouse of a car.

Those of you who keep your R&amp;Ts (you're supposed to, you know) can find
all the details of the Wasserboxer in the June 1983 issue. But our long-
term Volkswagen is no ordinary Vanagon. Ours has the Westfalia camper
conversion with its tilt-up top, sleeping accomodations for four, stove,
refrigerator, pressurized water supply and kitchen sink, plus closets,
drawers, bins and nooks.

As a camper, the Vanagon has come through our long-term evaluation with
nothing but gold stars. The Westfalia conversion is thorough, well done
and reflects a lot of careful development so that the campers inside the
camper have nothing but a good time. Our pleasures with the camping
equipment was described in the July 1984 R&amp;T.

Our average fuel consumption has been 20.6 mpg, with the best mileage
about 23 mpg and the worst running 17.5. Considering the enormous
volume, the substantial weight and the generally pleasant driving
characteristics, the fuel economy is more than acceptable.

Driving the Vanagon, however, is not like driving a car. For one thing,
the heating and ventilation system is beyond comprehension. Even with
the owner's manual no one was able to figure out how best to use the
four levers and two fan controls. The steering is heavy, the cornering
speeds are low, the shifting linkage is imprecise and the acceleration,
while superior to any previous Volkswagen van, is still below par. This
isn't all that bad in something like the Vanagon, because it changes
your state of mind. This is a vehicle in which the getting there is less
enjoyable than having gotten there. In the Vanagon you sit back, relax,
enjoy the scenery and ... oh,yes ... you wonder about the temperature
gauge.

This has been the Achilles' heel of our camper. Four months after it
went into use (and with 16,400 miles on the odometer), the Vanagon
developed a coolant leak. Then another four months later the temperature
gauge and its warning light began to challenge our nerve. The
temperature gauge needle would, on occasion, jump to the hot end of the
scale. It would just as quickly return to its usual resting place in
the normal zone, and there would be no more trouble. It showed no signs
of distress, didn't need coolant, and rarely acted up. Then on a trip
to Eloy, Arizona, the gauge pegged itself for most of the trip, all the
while with the red warning light glowing brightly. The driver had
checked the coolant level and noted that the engine didn't act hot or
feel hot. Although the gauge was acting spotty, he continued the trip
without problem but on return sent the Vanagon to the dealer to have
the gauge checked.

The gauge, sender and wiring were checked, all worked perfectly and the
dealer sent us on our way. The van worked fine for a week. Then the
gauge began acting up again.

During the next several months this scenario was repeated several times.
People would notice the gauge, check the engine compartment, then drive
on and take the Volkswagen to the dealer when they returned. At the
local dealer the service people tried everything they could think of.

After one of these episodes the dealer suspected a leaking head gasket
so the mechanics retorqued the cylinder head bolts and said the problem
was now solved. The next weekend the light and gauge again played their
games, the coolant was checked and the driver thought nothing of it
until the first heater went cold, then the engine lost power and almost
immediately a banging began from back in the engine compartment. It was
1:00 a.m. on a cold night and the car was 75 miles from home.

That's when one editor camped in the parking lot of a Volkswagen dealer
until he could be rescued the next morning. The post-mortem inspection
at La Torre Volkswagen in Reseda revealed that the water pump had sprung
a leak, the coolant was lost and the engine was damaged beyond repair.
A new short block was installed, under warranty, and the Vanagon was
returned to us with a note from the service manager that the temperature
gauge was working perfectly.

And it continued to work perfectly until the next trip when the gauge
and light returned to their antics. Another trip to the dealer and
another gauge has been ordered.

At 36,000 miles the gauge and light still aren't reliable. This isn't
something we've experienced with other Vanagons, and we can't call it
a problem of design. It's just a gremlin that has become as frustrating
to our local dealer as it is to us.

Otherwise the Vanagon has been a durable, troublefree machine. Regular
maintenance has cost $145, a reasonable figure for the service
performed. Repairs have added another $130 to our bill. Certainly if
many of the small problems and the one large problem had not been
covered by the warranty, this figure would have been much, much higher.
The repair work for the overheated engine totaled $1504, all of it
under warranty. Now that all Volkswagens are covered by a 2-year,
unlimited-mileage warranty, this could be of enormous value for the
driver who plies on the miles.

The overall condition of the Volkswagen is excellent considering the
mileage. The camping equipment looks as good as new, the upholstery is
not showing any wear. The most noticeable interior wear is to the paint
on the front doors. When the shoulder harnesses are released, they
recoil so fast that the fasteners hit the door and chip the paint.

For our final trip to the shop we went through the van with a fine-
tooth comb and found that one speaker on the radio was out of
commission, a door switch for the inside light was broken, the left
front vent window latch was loose and the sliding door latch
occasionally sticks. Not a bad tally for 36,000 miles, much of those
over back roads into remote campsites.

Our total cost per mile worked out to 26.5 cents. That's one of the
higher figures we've noted during our years of extended-use reports,
and, as always, it reflects a sizable amount of depreciation, as
determined by the Kelley Blue Book. As imperfect as this method is for
determining value of a used vehicle, our means are consistent.

That figure may be misleading when compared with other cars, because
the camper is more than a car. And do you know any houses that get
20 mpg?

While our Vanagon has had one continuing problem, it has also served
us in ways nothing else can match. And besides, if you have to be
stranded, this is probably the best vehicle in the world for the job.
