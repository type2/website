Subject: Re: breather hose:-)|:-( 

Although the &quot;fiche&quot; says (Order in units of 5 [5 being 5 meters long]), the
price in the parts price list for any and all hoses beginning with the &quot;N&quot;
prefix are sold and priced per meter.  Grungy - how much were you charged for
this one (1) meter?  Just curious.
