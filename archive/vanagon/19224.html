This is odd, you should be able to hold 75mph on the highway, 60+mph on long 
grades and generally drive without obstructing traffic, 4th gear almost 
always. There is NO comparison between a '71 and '77 engine, the '77 puts 
out almost 20% more power, 72 vs 58HP, (iff'n I remember OK). Got any 
compression in that engine? Valves OK? Top speed in my '71 Westy was ~60mph 
when new, was ~80 in 2.0l '78 Westy when old.

I used 20W50 in summer in aircooleds, 10W30 some winters 5W20 others. I 
wouldn't use 40W, makes for more starting effort than necessary.   tim s.
