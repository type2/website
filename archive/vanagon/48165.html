Subject: List stickers
Date: Fri, 09 Aug 1996 22:30:12 GMT

I really screwed up. I meant to get a list sticker from Richard before
he went on his trip, put it off and said I would get one after he came
back. Well, the list has split and I still haven't gotten one. Now I
have to beg. :-(

Does anyone on the list have a list sticker they could be persuated to
part with so that my Vanagon (&quot;The Dub&quot;) can wear it.
Please. Pretty please.

Feel free to e-mail.
