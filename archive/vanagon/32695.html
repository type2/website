Subject: Need Advice on Window Changes on Rumba


hey now,

i have access to 2 side windows from the donor '71 westy that my interior 
comes from. the kinda that you can roll out and that have screens on them.
i'd like to hear some discussion on whether i should put them on my '74 
transporter. hell, will they even fit? advantages and disadvantages? will 
i be able to get a tight seal? your help would be greatly appreciated!
