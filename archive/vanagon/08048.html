Subject: 'Tis the Season, a trip report


Christmas tree prospecting in the Chiricahua mountains, SE Arizona.

A few weeks ago, Janice, my SO, and I decided that *this* year we would
drive up in the mountains to cut our own Christmas tree.  Once this plan
was made known, Janice's sister, Debbie, and our friend Mike asked if they
might join the expedition and get trees of their own.  After some thought
and planning we decided that Dec, 11, this past Sunday, was the best day to
go for all concerned.  I sent off to the Douglas Ranger District for permits.

Well, I wanted to take &quot;Prospector&quot;, my 1972 bus/camper/off-road vehicle
because it has a Safari Custom Camper high-top (lots of room inside) and
big tires for driving the dirt roads.  The problem was, at the time, I only
had a driver's seat and the rest of the vehicle was empty! (I'm in the
middle of re-doing the interior)  Also, I've never had the heat hooked up
on this vehicle and since I was planning on going up to around eight to nine
thousand feet in mid December I decided I'd better do something about that
too.  (Janice gets cold easily and both our beagle and Debbie's dachshund
are short haired dogs so they are cold wimps too.)

Well, about two weeks ago I took the bus to a local shop and they installed
a turn-around seat from a later model bus on the passenger's side (the wall
behind that seat had been removed by a previous owner).  This is/will be nice
for camping, etc.  Then, just last week a friend with a '73 bus mentioned that
he had a middle (two person) seat that he took out of his bus when it was new
that he didn't want and would I like to buy it for cheap?  Well, now I was all
set, seat-wise.

Unfortunately, Prospector was a Westfalia in a previous life so only
two of the little mounting slots for the middle seat are present on the
floor (need 6).  I solved this by welding (MIG) some 3/8&quot; nuts to the floor
in the appropriate places.  Now, when I want the seat in the bus, I just
thread some studs into these captive nuts and install the seat with the
holders and another nut on top.  Works great and when the seat is out,
nothing sticks up from the floor.

At the same time I was installing this seat (and seatbelts) I bought a
large scrap of carpeting for $5 at a yard sale, cut it to size and covered
the floor with it.  At the sliding door threshold I just contact cemented
the edge of the carpet to the floor so it wouldn't stick up.  In the back,
over the engine compartment, I put some 1.5&quot; rubber foam pads under the
carpet to quiet the engine noise.  (works quite well)

For heat, I bought some of the 2&quot; metal heater flex-hose and connected
the heat exchangers directly to the ends of the heat ducts. (I don't yet have
the heat-valve boxes, there is more junk-yard scrounging in my future!)  This
means the heat is on all the time, OK for mid winter.

Sunday morning came and we loaded up dogs, blankets, food, people,
hot-chocolate, tool kit, spare parts, saws, x-mas tree permits, etc.
and drove off toward the the mountains.  (I have a trunk-size storage cabinet
over the front cab as a result of the high-top.)  Our destination was the top
of the Chiricahua mountains, about 150 miles from Tucson.  I kept the
speed at about 60 mph and found that I was getting about 20-21 mpg
which is about normal for this vehicle.  The heater was really pumping
out the heat and we had to use the fresh air vents to keep the interior
from getting too warm.  I noticed that the air from the heater had a
slight oily smell to it but I have come to expect that from air-cooled
engines.

At the base of the mountains the road turned to dirt with quite a bit
of washboard and rocks.  Prospector climbed from 4000 to 8500 feet like
a champ although the interior noise level certainly increased substantially.
I really like the louvered, screened side windows on this bus but I think
the make more rattling noise on rough roads than normal side windows would.
There are a lot of other rattles and I hope I will be able to stop some of
these as the interior takes shape.

At the top we didn't find any snow or mud as I had expected we might, just
nice dry dirt roads and a beautiful sun-shiney day!  We walked the dogs and
then ate lunch before tromping off through the forest looking for trees the
right size and shape for Christmas trees.  It didn't take us long to round
up three trees, Janice and I got a 7-foot tree, Debbie found a nice 5-foot
tree for her apartment, and Mike got a 9-footer because he has an old adobe
home with high ceilings.  With a little inginuity, we were able to get all
three trees in the bus, behind the middle seat and set off for home with a
very full vehicle!  (The views from the road along the mountain top, both
to the east and west, are quite breath-taking!)

Of course we had to stop off in Wilcox (along I-10) at Stout's Cider Mill
to get some of their home-made apple pie and/or apple crisp (heated up with
ice cream on top, and coffee!) and then back to Tucson.  That evening we
decorated the tree at my house while listening to Christmas music and eating
pizza.  Definitely a good day!

Cheers,

 -Dyer

P.S.  I took a few photographs and will scan 'em in for my WWW page when I
      get the film developed.
