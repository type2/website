Subject: Help! Need a Saint Louis Mechanic 

Hi,
        I *desperately* need some help finding a mechanic for a friend of
mine near Saint Louis.  I loaned out our '82 vanagon and it has developed
an oil leak and is having trouble finding first gear.  I am not from that
area, and I have no access to any yellow pages for the Saint Louis area.
Could anyone from that area please, please, please send me a quick note
with names and numbers of trusted mechanics?!?  I promise to drop your name
in hopes that you will might get a break on your next job with them : ^ )
Any responses welcomed, the more for any particular garage the better!
TIA,
Dave.
