Subject: Stretch splittie


The months volksworld has a short article on some Californian guy who
has stretched a splittie to almost double length. Not including the cab
doors and rear corner glass, the bus now has seven windows along each
side. The whole thing looks amazingly long and very wierd. 

The plan is to black out the windows, put in chrome window frames and 
use it as a limo! (With a bar:) ).

The article says the project should hopefully be finished in time
for the VW classic at Irvine Meadows (whatever/wherever that is),
so you American folks should be seeing it around.

cheers
