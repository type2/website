Subject: Re: oil changes

Thanks to everyone who responded for my request for help on 
oil change tips for my '86 Vanagon. The good people on the 
list set me straight on which kind of oil and filter to use. 

Basically DO NOT use FRAM oil filters, sounds like they don't 
work for the Vanagon, creating blockages, have a potential 
to burst and have been known to screw up your oil pressure. 
Like to stay clear of such nasty things, not very pleasant 
I'm sure. 

Also the list recommends not using 10W-40. On the archive I 
read that it's not recommend for most cars, let alone the 
delicate constitution of a Vanagon. 

So I'm using a Purolator oil filer and Castrol 20W-50 oil.
Synthetic oils are not an option at this time. My Vanagon has
133K miles on it and I believe that it's always had dino juice
so I'm not going to change now.

Thanks again,
John Sharpe
