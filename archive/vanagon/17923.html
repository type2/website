Subject: Cooler?


Not too long ago, some folks were discussing the old &quot;water-powered&quot; car coolers 
available for Vws (and other cars).

Just saw an ad in Hemming's for the &quot;ClassicAire Car Cooler&quot;----

&quot;ClassicAire Car Cooler, Moden version of the Evaporative Cooler, Works in Dry 
Climate.  $219.95 + $10 S&amp;H from J&amp;M Engineering, Inc., P.O. Box 739, Camas WA 
98607  FAX (3060) 834-5227&quot;

This is on page 3692 in the May '95 issue of Hemmings Motor News.
