Subject: My EV/MV might be for sale...

Ok..Ok...I know this might be heresy...but I just took a look at a new
car (brand/model to remain secret for now...), and I'm considering
getting rid of the EV. Ok..ok..I might be a bit more level headed about
this in a day or so...but..strike while the iron's hot...

Here's the info

93 EV/MV
ABS, 5 speed
42k well maintained miles
5 k miles on new tires
new Die Hard battery
Bra, and other accessories
NEVER abused...

$16.5k


Any interest?

Ric
