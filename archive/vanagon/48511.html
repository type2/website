Subject: Re: Free Camping book still available ?

The free camping book mentioned on the water-cooled list is, I think,
still available at Camping World.  I think it's by Don Wright.  As
an alternative, there's a book called something like Save-A-Buck
Camping, which is as I recall spaces costing up to $5.

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.  Thanks!  /m
