&gt; &gt;Can I put my spare 1600 (70) engine into my 59 (If I make all the necessary

&gt; &gt;measured anything or actually thought about it a lot, but I saw a post were
&gt; &gt;someone said that this engine would more or less fit back to 55.

&gt; Should work fine.  My '59 has a dual port 1600 in it (previous owner
&gt; partially butchered back &quot;firewall&quot; to get it in).
&gt; 
&gt; If you're using 12v flywheel you will need to clearance tranny slightly.

I think he said he wanted to keep the bus 6V.  In which case he might 
have a problem with fitting a 6V flywheel on a 12V crank.  I'm not sdure 
what the problem is exactly, just that there is one.  :)
As long as he's putting in a 12V engine, he might as well convert to 
12V.  Just the lights, battery, starter, and fix the tranny.  It's a 
hassle the other way around.
