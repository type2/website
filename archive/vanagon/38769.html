Subject: Need help with Wiper Washer Switch

Hallo, there.

I need to now a couple of things if anyone could be so helpful:


1.  How does one remove the Wiper switch in a '69 Bus?  OR how does one
replace said switch OR how does one remove the squirters from the front. Or
how's this:

What is the complete Removal and replacement procedure for a Wiper Washer
switch and hosing?

And if they ever break (the hoses) can they be repaired or just replace the
whole thing?

2.  Is it possible to get new door handles keyed to match the iginition
without robbing Fort Knox?

Thanks
