Subject: Panamint springs


&gt;A possible option to Red Rocks might be Panamint Springs Resort, located as you
&gt;might expect at Panamint Springs on US190 east of Lone Pine.  I stayed there
&gt;Sunday night.  They have motel, restaurant, hookup, and tent site
&gt;accommodationsalong with a pot bellied pig named Charlotte, a very friendly
&gt;abyssinian cat
&gt;named Taz, reasonable food, HOT SHOWERS, FLUSH TOILETS etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;Eight bucks for tent site, 15 bucks for full hookups in the shade of the
&gt;tamarisk trees.  The location is 2hrs/50mi from Saline Valley and Palm Springs
&gt;for those who would like the naturist view of a desert oasis.  They also have
&gt;a multi-acre area where we could &quot;circle the wagons&quot; so to speak and they do
&gt;take reservations.  The local views are specatacular with the snow capped
&gt;Panamint Range and the sand dunes.  Death Valley proper is 86mi away with its
&gt;date shakes and milling throngs of &quot;snowbirds&quot; and LALA land tourists.
&gt;
This sounds good.  Do you know if we can reserve sites there?  Or will we
have the same problem there?
