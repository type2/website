Subject: Re: FUKENGRUVEN!

&gt;I was at a Volkswagon show this past weekend and they had stickers that read
&gt;&quot;Fukenbroken&quot; with a figure holding a wrench. 
&gt;
I gotta get one of these.  I laughed out load when I read this.  Let me
know if you find a source for these.

I am still laughing as I write this.
