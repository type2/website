Volks,
	This copy of the itinerary contains locations and times that I am
*guaranteed* to be at (unless my bus is run over by a tank) on GNATT.  If
you are considering hooking up with the tour, SAVE THIS MESSAGE and take
it with you.  I have printed out a large quantity of GNATT flyers and will
leave them in obvious places that we are staying with directions.

-David

	anticipate a problem finding a place to stay - I called the Oregon
