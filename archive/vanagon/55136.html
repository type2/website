Subject: re: EV piston EV Piston Slap 


I also had a problem getting my dealer to take a good look at the EV
so that they could decide if it had the piston slap problem.

Here's what I did: I wrote  a letter to the dealer, asking them to do
full diagnostics, and reply to me _in_writing_, that they had
found/had not found the piston slap problem.   This ensured that they
took a _serious_ look at it, as in removing the cylinder head and
checking the inside of the cylinders (in our case they ordered a new
engine block afterwards).

 guess asking them to put it writing nudged them enough to takew the
trouble and look inside...
