Subject:      Re: Yes, wheels... again! (long)

the 5000 turbo wheels are on my syncro even as we speak.  check the
archives for my detailed posting on the conversion.  the wheels are at
the correct track because of the 10 mm spacers and the handling is
nothing if not markedly improved.  the center caps to the wheels fit
as long as you cut a 1/2 &quot; notch in the retaining ring to clear the
split pins on the rear axles.  the pirelli scorpions in a 215/75-15
are great,  especially in the wet.
cheers
