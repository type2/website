Subject: Re: Collapsing Westy Tents

What is a westy tent? What? You don't know what a westy tent is? No, I got
an 83 westy but don't know what you guys are talking about the tent. Did it
come with your westy or did you pay extra to get it?

I got my 83 westy from a buddy who got a job as a VP overseas so had to quit
all his cars and move out. He gave me a large cloth bag and said it's a camping
tent inside. I have never had a chance to open it up and see what it is yet.
Now all the messages on this net wanting a westy tent has gotten me curious.
So what is a westy tent? I am going to go home to find out if I got one too.
Thanks.
