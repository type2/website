That's it exactly.  And mine has a broken something-or-other so that the 
door won't pop into place when trying to close the door.  I've got to do 
a full body check in order to get it to close and latch.  (Translation 
for the American non-hockey-playing unwashed: I've got to bump it pretty 
hard with my body to slam the door sideways into the body of the van hard 
enough to get it to close.)  It also doesn't hold the door away from the 
body properly, so the door ends up rubbing against the side of the van, 
scratching the paint along the cover running over the upper track below 
the rear side windows (hope you can picture that).

I'm not sure how the mechanics of the swivel hinge works, but there 
appear to be a spring (or remains thereof) not attached to anything, and 
some holes in the hinge where the springs could fit (if they weren't 
broke).  Nobody around here seems to know much about fixing this 
problem--even those who want to charge me a lot of money to fix it.  If 
anyone out there has ideas, I'd love to hear 'em.

I've gotta fix it 'cause my bony butt is beginning to dent the side door 
from over-zealous application of the Canadian door-closing method.  :-(
