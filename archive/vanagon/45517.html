&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;I have a noise from my 1986 Vanagon engine compartment.  Upon further
investigation I find that the waterpump bearing has a lot of play and is
getting ready to let go.  Does anyone care to venture a guess at what this
job could cost. I wonder if I can do it myself.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas will be welcomed
