Dear VWers,

I am considering to replace a panel on my 80 vanagon. This panel goes
from the roof to the bumper on the driver side nose of the car. It is
just left of the front left head light.

Any info on how to take the old one off?

Any tips on how to put the new one in?

Are there any books on this stuff?

Appreciated &amp; Regards,
Vahid
