we're painting the Pumpkin this
spring and I may want to co-ordianate w/the paint job.  What have others =
used
on their fiberglass?

Hey Ruthie &amp; All,

I had my bus painted about a year &amp; 1/2 ago, the guy who painted it used =
an automotive paint on the fiberglass top but added a &quot;flexible =
additive.&quot;  I'm not sure what it was, but he said it would keep the =
paint from cracking due to the flexing of the fiberglass.

You may wish to check with an automotive paint supplier about the =
additive.
