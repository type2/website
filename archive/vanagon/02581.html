&gt; Have any of you ever actually cooked on your engine, manifold,
&gt; exhaust, muffler, whatever?  I'd like to hear more about this!
&gt; Also, does anyone actually have this book, &quot;Manifold Destiny,&quot;
&gt; and, if so, would you kindly e-mail me the author and publisher?
&gt; 

No. But I've seen some real BBQ's though, although I think they where
unintentional.  ;)

Yeah....Have some more coffee Steven......
