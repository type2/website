So Ric -I'll-never-give-up-my-EV-unless-my-wife-says-so says:

&gt; I'm confused.....why would VW bring back the Vanagon, considering it has 
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Now there's an understatement!  ;p ;)

&gt; been out of production in Germany since late 1989...considering the 16valve 
 
 Mine is stamped 1990 &amp; the Westfalia gear is February 1991.

&gt; I wish people would get it thru their heads that the T4 is a great design 
&gt; that it is VWUS Marketing Department's act of Coppulating Vertically that it 
&gt; was not the sales success here in the US that it is in the rest of VWs world 
&gt; market.

If VW were really smart, they'd produce both.  I thinkg they both have
advantages and disadvantages.  I like the width of the vanagon and the
general layout, but I can see how others would like the EV instead.  
Some people have to be crazy.   ;)   

&gt; Oh well..I guess I'm cranky...
&gt; Ric

Uh-huh....  So what else is new?   :)  :)  :) ;p  :) :) :)

Ta-ta!
