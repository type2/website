&gt;Has anyone noticed more and more of these semi/dump-truck trailers
&gt;that swivel up so that one could drive a bull-dozer or other vechile
&gt;onto the trailer, then tip it back level.
&gt;These trailors have no bumpers, are right at windshield level and
&gt;the wheels are a good 8 feet under there.
&gt;I am positive that there are specifications about how low a semi's
&gt;bumper must come.  So how do these guys get around the rules?

it's time once again for Unca Joel's Sermonettes. :)

Survival Rule #1:
    Beware Of Things Bigger Than You Are.

if you sail small boats, you have to watch out for the big boats. no matter
what the &quot;rules&quot; say about &quot;right of way&quot; and so forth. a big boat cannot
stop quickly, even if it saw you and wanted to. and you have to watch out
for whales ... especially the big ones.

if you fly small airplanes, you have to beware of the big airplanes. the
wake of a big airplane, even down on the runway or taxi-way, can be very
dangerous. it is NOT a good idea to fly small aircraft into large controlled
airports where airliner-sized airplanes land and take off.

if you drive a car, you have to be wary of trucks. the government has set
different safety standards for them, but allows them to use the same roads.
they also cannot stop quickly, even when they want to. their tires can
explode (especially when they use cheap recaps) ... and if you are next to
one when it does, you can be seriously hurt. so don't linger beside a truck:
get the hell on around it.

if you are worrying about the bumper heights on a truck, you are too close!!!
drop back until you can see his mirrors (and he can see you!).

and watch the hell out for trains. yes, i know. but sooner or later, you'll
have to cross some railroad tracks. trains are MUCH bigger than trucks, and
can't stop nearly as quick!

if you ride bicycles or motorcycles, then you have to beware of automobiles
AND trucks ... cause they completely ignore you!

in other words, if you are a little dog, you stay the hell away from big dogs.
it's that simple. in practical terms, it means giving extra room and time to
things (and people!) who are bigger than your car (or you).  :)  if you've
ever worked on a farm, you know NOT to get into small spaces with large
animals ... they can hurt you badly, even when they do not &quot;mean&quot; to. (ever
have a 1500 black angus bull stand on your foot???)

as to why the government has different standards ... the reason should be
obvious to anyone over the age of 30:   $$$$.   yup. same old thing: money
makes the world go round. it also makes the rules change. it's the Golden
Rule: He Who Has The Money Makes The Rules.

and since the trucking industry serves a LOT of the country and causes a LOT
of money to change hands (wink, wink, nudge, nudge; oh, hello, congressman!),
they tend to get &quot;special&quot; treatment. same thing with airlines and trains and
oil companies and so forth.

now, back to trucks, MOST of the truck drivers are a lot better drivers than
you or i (personal opinion being stated, based upon years of observation and
semi-experience with trucks) ... for a couple of very good reasons: (1) they
have to take a lot more training to get a license to drive those things, and
most of the trainees actually pay attention in the classes. which is a lot
more than can be said of the 16-year olds in Driver's Ed classes. (2) they
get a lot more practice (driving) than you or i.

i'm not &quot;defending&quot; trucks, cause there are many &quot;bad&quot; drivers out there ...
as many trucks as there are on the road and as many hours as they have to
drive, it's inevitable that you'll have bad drivers and bad situtations and
accidents. especially when you put 80,000-pound trucks and 4,000-pound cars
on the same highways at the same speeds.  i'm just expressing my opinions ...
i'd lots rather drive at night, with the trucks, than in the daytime with
the same number of four-wheelers. MOST of the trucks at least try to be
courteous and careful ... almost NONE of the cars are even thinking about
what they are doing. in my opinion. :)
