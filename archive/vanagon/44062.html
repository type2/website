&gt;  I'd also like to hear what's supposed to be bad about typical RV solid
&gt;state isolator blocks.  I happen to have one in stock that I thought I'd
&gt;install with my inverter and land line automatic charger.  I'd like to 
&gt;avoid making a bad judgement call.

They have an inherent voltage drop across their internal diodes that prevents
the battery from becomming completely charged.
