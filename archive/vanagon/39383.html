Subject: [68-91] limited slip diff

For those who wish a bit more traction when off-roading or in slippery stuff.

Weddle Eng. sells LockRite auto-locking rear diffs for buses, 1968-1991 for 
IRS bus or vanagons.  2 models, #1310/1311, for 2 or 4 spider gears (4 is 
stronger than two) price was $311/$345 (or jobbers prices $264/$293).  I 
think the install costs about the same again.  For those with decomposing 
trannys this would be a nice timely upgrade. Weddles # 310-598-2731, Long 
Beach, CA.
