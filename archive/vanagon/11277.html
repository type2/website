Subject:       He's Baaa-aaack!  /f

With a mighty flick of his finger-tips Super Digester sheds his 
cloak of restraint and enters the real-time mode once again!

Hi folks, I'm back-on-ack (whatever ack means).  Here's my 
rationalization for those who are in similar situations:

the disk space alone that was being used up in saving complete 
digests instead of just the pertinent article wasn't worth the time 
savings in digest mode.... cough, cough, ahem.

Don't worry.  I'm more disciplined now and feeling just fine (Step 
10?)
