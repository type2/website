Subject: &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; NC Volkswagen Commemorative Plate Petition&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
From: nenauss_at_aol_dot_com (NENauss)
Date: 29 Sep 1995 02:43:50 -0400

The legislature of North Carolina requires at least 300 signatures in
order to approve the manufacture of a new style of commemorative vehicle
liscence plate.  We are currently in the process of collecting those
signatures and need your help.  We need VW owners, registered in the state
of NC, to help us with this petition.  The VW commemorative plate, once
approved, will cost $20 per year in addition to the $25 required by the
state of NC to register a vehicle.
If you are interested, please send via E-Mail: Your name, address, phone
number to NENAUSS_at_AOL.COM   If you have any questions, my daytime phone
number is (919)-828-0901.

Thanks,   Nelson Nauss
