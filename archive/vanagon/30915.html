Subject: Re: dashboard alters

I'm altering my dashboard -- so far I have used a crowbar and a variable
temperature soldering iron. Lately I have switched to a pitchfork and find I
can get superior traction. Now that it's altered I realize that like all VW
work, I should have asked for divine intervention before I lifted my first
tool.

Cheers -- Rob the job
