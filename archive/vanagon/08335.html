Subject: What's wrong with my brakes?

	You might have seen some of my previous messages, I've been 
having trouble with my brakes for a while. I can't figure out why they're 
dragging. They work fine after the bus (an early 60's) has sat for a few 
hours, but after 10-20 min of driving, they start dragging. It gets worse 
and worse until you can't even drive anymore. This seems to 
be associated with actual driving and not usage of the brakes, because it 
happens fastest after driving on the freeway for a while, without 
braking. It seems as if something might be heating up, expanding, and 
casing the shoes to rub. The problem is mainly in the rear wheels. I've 
bled the brakes and replaced the master cylinder as well as the two rear 
wheel cylinders, with no luck. Also the return springs appear normal and 
functional. If I adjust the shoes away from the drums, they simply move 
out further until they are again dragging. The pistons in the wheel 
cylinders seem to just be forced out of the cylinder and do not go back 
in until the bus sits for a couple hours. The old master cylinder I 
replaced was pretty shot, so it is concieveable that some rust or crud 
could have been forced into the lines, but I don't see how it could cause 
the brakes to bind up over time and then release. There appeared to be no 
air in the lines after I bled them, but concievably air in the lines 
could somehow be heating up over time and expanding in the lines, but 
this seems improbable as well. If you have any ideas, please drop me a line.

Thanks for the help,

--Jonny
