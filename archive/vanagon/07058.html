Temperatures here have dipped to the minus 10 C mark for the first time
and I have been pleasantly surprised by the ability of the 82 to start
and run flawlessly. Three comments: the previous owners lived in
California and so for the better part of the Westfalia's existence (12
years) I doubt that it ever saw temperatures as cold as now, and for some
reason I doubted that it would do well in cold weather - so far so good;
secondly, thus far the heat coming from the vents is warm and even hot
after the engine has been run for awhile so for me the issue is NOT the
poor quality of the heat coming from the heat system but its distribution
and filling the huge space - too me this is where the heating system is
inadequate; after all engine temps reach 340-400 and that heat could easily
be used to heat a room if properly directed; third,the traKnsmission has
filled with 90w80 and leaks at start up but not after.... hmmm DC
