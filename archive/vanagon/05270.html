I used to be concerned about having a front end wreck in a bus, with only a 
foot or so of metal as protection. That was until I went to buy some parts 
off a 79 bus that had hit a Landrover head-on. (In case you've never seen 
one, a Landrover a sort of Jeep with a chassis built out of the leftover 
parts of the Forth Bridge). It came round a bend on a narrow country road on 
the wrong side of the road and hit the bus with a combined speed of about 
60mph. The Landrover had its engine block break in two and bent the front 
axle into a V-shape (quite an achievement as these axles look like they're 
recycled from old steam locomotives). The bus, although completely wrecked 
with a twisted shell and no driver's door, was driven back a mile or so to 
the guy's house. He was completely unharmed apart from a few bruises. Ralf 
Nader? Sit on this!
