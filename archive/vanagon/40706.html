Subject: Whoa there, Buck! - - Corvair thread

When I was in college at the Colorado School of Mines, my fraternity used to
hold &quot;rush&quot; parties up in the hills west of Denver at the mountain cabin
(mountain mansion, rather) of a rich alumnus.  When I was a Junior, a good
friend and I were assigned clean up and lock up duties and so were the last
to leave - well after midnight.  We got in his Corvair Spyder and were
heading down US285 toward Denver, when a large 4 point buck ran out on the
road in front of us and collided with the Corvair.  We went off the road and
ended up almost in the adjacent creek.  Results:

1)  End of buck - dirty shame - he was a big one

2)  End of Corvair - front end totally trashed and partially rolled. - - but
we were able to get it out of the creek with aid of a guy with a jeep and a
winch - and drive it home 

3)  Misc bruises, etc. for us

4)  Had to shovel out the passenger area of the Corvair before he sold it to
a guy with one that had been rear-ended.

It was a great car and I was sorry to see it go down the road.
