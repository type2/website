&gt;Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to
&gt;drive it around yet, I am curious as to what the attitude of cops have
&gt;been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
&gt;often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
&gt;&quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

when i had my 71 and 73 buses, i got stopped ONCE in ten years ... cause the
wind was blowing me all over the road, and they thought i was drunk. and i
used to drive pretty fast (way too fast for the poor little engine, he
realized much too late). it was really funny, cause if i was in a group of
cars, the cops never looked at any of us ... it was like they figured if a
vw bus could keep up, they CAN'T be going fast!

when i got the vanagon, things changed! it didn't 'look' like a bus, and so
the cops treated it like a dodge or ford van ... or maybe it bounced radar
better (flatter front end) or the radar guns got better or something. anyway,
i'd get stopped and looked at a lot more. only got one actual ticket though,
when they walked up to the window, i always had the interior lights on and
my driver's license out, and both hands on the top of the steering wheel.
that kinda surprised them. :)  the only ticket i got (in 14 years) was a
young clown who was getting his quota, and didn't even know what kind of
car it was ... he ASKED me if it was a Volvo!!! &lt;i wonder if i coulda gotten
out of it, if i'd said 'yes'!!!&gt;. but i figured, what the hell ... there had
been so many times i SHOULD have gotten a ticket, so ... i just paid it.

my theory is that it's the low sleek RED or YELLOW or BLACK cars that attract
the eyes of the cops, just as the attract the eyes of the consumer ... and
most of them LOOK fast, just sitting still anyway. when i had a little Honda
CRX (blue, of course), they ALWAYS looked at it and hit it with the radar.
maybe the cops know what sort of cars the kids have, and go after them. down
here, they like to pick on the 18-wheelers, too ... cause the radar picks
them up a looonnnng way away. and most drivers will just pay up, rather than
come back to try to get out of it in court.
