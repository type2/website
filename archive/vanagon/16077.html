&gt; Dug up the ol' chemical reaction that goes on in a battery.
&gt; 
&gt; Take a deep breath:
&gt; 
&gt; remember, the battery is made up of alternating lead and lead oxide plates,
&gt; with sulfuric acid as an electrolyte.
&gt; 
&gt; the electrolyte contains hydrogen ions (H+) and sulphate ions (SO4--).
&gt; During discharge, H+ ions react with the lead(IV) oxide to give
&gt; lead(II)oxide and water;
&gt; 
&gt; 	PbO2 + 2H+ + 2e-  -&gt; PbO + H2O
&gt; 
&gt; the reaction takes electrons from the plate, causing a positive charge.
&gt; There is a further reaction to yield soft lead sulphate;
&gt; 
&gt; 	PbO + SO4-- + 2H+  -&gt; PbSO4 + H2O + 2e-
&gt; 
&gt; electrons are released to the electrode, producing a negative charge.
&gt; 
&gt; You can see how the production of H2O accounts for the lower specific
&gt; gravity in a discharged battery.
&gt; 
&gt; During charging the reactions are reversed;
&gt; 
&gt; 	PbSO4 + 2e-  -&gt;  Pb + SO4--
&gt; 	PbSO4 + 2H2O  -&gt; PbO2 + 4H+ + SO4-- + 2e-
&gt; 
&gt; Now the specific gravity of the electrolyte (sulfuric acid) increases.
&gt; 
&gt; I still can't see where EDTA would fit in.
&gt; I don't see any divalent cations...
&gt; 
&gt; Alistair
&gt; 
&gt; 
 
It's only effective when the battery is in a discharged state, if that's 
any help (still haven't located those papers, but I will)...
