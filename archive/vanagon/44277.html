1) Squeaky distributor. My engine squeaks. It usually does it the first
five minutes or so of driving. It is more noticable at idle. I thought it
could be the generator, but I disconnected the generator pulley and the
squeaking persisted. I put my head in the engine when it was running, and
it seemed to be coming from the distributor. How should I fix this?

assuming that you have a mechanical advance distributor, drop a few drops of
clean oil on the fiber in the middle of the shaft.  you have to pull off the
cap and rotor to do this

also, make sure you have greased the shaft where the points hit the lobes.  


3) Carburetor pre-heat hose. The PO connected an air hose from a hole on
the upper right of the fan shroud to a hole under the air intake of the air
cleaner (stock oil air cleaner). I didn't think anything of it until I saw
a picture in the RMMW catalog of a carburetor pre-heat hose running from a
hole in the rear engine tin to the air cleaner. Which way is correct? Would
introducing heated air into the carburetor from underneath the rear engine
tin help my cold engine idling problems?

the pre heat hose should run from the air cleaner through a hole in the rear
tin to euther the hot air blown over the cylinders, or to a connector to the
muffler.    if you live in a climate prone to 34 degrees and raining (all
from western washington say yo)    this will help you prevent carb icing and
cold idling.
