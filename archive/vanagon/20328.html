&gt; On my '81 air-cooled westy, I have a stock VW air-conditiong unit,

&gt; form and drip down over top of whatever I have stored there
&gt; right behind the rear passenger seat.  Does anyone else have this
&gt; problem and if so, anyway to minimize it?

There should be a drain pan to catch all that...perhaps it is cracked
(mine was, on a '90 no less!)
