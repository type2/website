Subject: Re: Where's the Fill Plug????

Hi Gang,  I have an '82 Diesel Westy which I love dearly.  Engine's 
rebuilt, runs great.  Only problem is a little seeping of transmission 
lube out of the main driveshaft bearings.  Enough has seeped over time 
that I'd like to check the level.  I've read too many posts of people 
who have driven these dry, and ended up with lots of $$$ needing to 
spend.  Yesterday I crawled under the Westy with my trusy 17 MM hex 
plug wrench which I've used to inspect other VW transmissions in the 
past.  I looked all over that transmission and can't find a plug OR a 
drainhole?  Did VW make these a sealed unit?  I see fittings that look 
like the might have been intended for fill/drain plugs, but they're 
solid with no fittings in them.  Where do you put the lube???  Thanks in 
advance for the help.
