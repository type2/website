Subject: changing coolant

Last weekend I changed the coolant of my vanagon the first time after at 
least eight years (BTW, I had never problems with my head gaskets so 
far). As always, I had problems to bleed it properly. But I managed to do 
it after several attempts.

Two things should be noteworthy:

- I have the feeling that it runs smoother and more silent,
- it definetely runs cooler now.

T.S.
83' vanagon
