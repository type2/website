Subject: Muffler for 83.5

Anybody ever buy a complete exhaust system from Bus Boys in Redding CA?  

As far as I can tell my waterboxer only needs a new muffler, tail pipe,
connector elbow (pipe between catalytic converter and where pipes off
cylender heads come together), and associated gaskets.  

California Import parts from Canada (I belive can get me the individual
pieces for a total of about $200.  I am not sure which company they are made
by but the guy from Bus Boys Says that those parts are going to be made out
of really poor qualtiy material and will fall aprt very quickly.  He sells a
complete system for $346 that he has specially designed assures me is made
out of superb material and has some special muffler that will help to
increase my power.

I don't mind spending the extra money if it really is better and is not going
to mess with my engine by having incorrect pressure for the exhaust coming
out of the cylinders or somthing else wierd like that.

Need some advice, Mike D (Noise Polluter)
