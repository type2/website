Subject: LP-less Westy Advice?
Date: Wed, 27 Sep 1995 10:30:34 -0400 (EDT)
From: Jay.Goldberg_at_ska_dot_com (Jay Goldberg)

Hi Volks

My new '77 Westy came with no LP tank.  I think that it'd be cool to
cook (I mean at least coffee); I have this great stove.  Is there
any way to hook up a little campstove LP tank to my stove for some
cooking?

	Thanks in advance for any advice!
