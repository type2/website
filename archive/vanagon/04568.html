&gt; There is a very obvious (can be seen and felt with the hand) uneven wear 
&gt; all over the road-surface of the tires. There are surface areas where the 
&gt; tread depth is much less than in a segment immediately preceeding or 
&gt; following in the same linear path.  Adjacent treads show a similar 
&gt; pattern but not in any consistent arrangement. There are small cracks 
&gt; where the sidewalls join the tread.

maybe you had them underinflated?

&gt; 
&gt; When I rotated the tires, the ones from the back (now on the front) 
&gt; really made a difference in driving and handling. I had the tires replace 
&gt; like they were on the trip.
&gt; 
&gt; It's Sunday morning and I'll take the EV back to the dealer this evening 
&gt; so they can get an early start on it (I hope) on Monday.  Will keep all 
&gt; interested informed.
&gt; 
&gt; Any and all comments are welcome!
&gt; 

i'm interested, for sure. we only have about 12k on our EV.
