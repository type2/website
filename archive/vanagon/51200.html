Subject:      ya say ya can't see at night? blind as a bat?? ..

well, step right up, friends and neighbors! hurry, hurry, hurry! :)
one thin dime, one tenth of a dollah! she walks, she talks, she crawls
on her belly like a reptile! ...

woops! wrong speech. :)  anyway, i replaced my old headlights tonight with
some Hella Vision Plus halogen lights. BIG improvement. H4 halogen bulb
(you can replace the bulb without having to replace the glass lense).
$37.50 each from Imparts in St. Louis.

low beam is better, more light farther out, and to the sides. there is a
definite &quot;cut-off&quot; of light above the level of the headlights themselves,
that is, above four feet off the ground, there is noticeably less light.
so as to NOT blind the on-coming traffic.

on high beam, however, it's a different story. :) i almost (almost, i said!)
don't need to turn on my space-shuttle landing lights. :)  high beams are
a BIG improvement over my old lights.

i'll let you know how i feel about them in a few more weeks, but my initial
impression is that they ARE worth the money. by the by, they are only for
the 7&quot; round headlights of the 1968-1985 buses (don't know if they'll fit
the 1952-1967 buses, but i know they won't fit the 86-91 vanagons' square
lights).

one slight possible drawback: the front of the glass is FLAT. and this
kinda makes the bus look cross-eyed, when viewed from the front. go figure.
so now it's Gus-Gus the Cross-Town Cross-Eyed Bus. :)
