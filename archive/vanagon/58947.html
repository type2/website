Please don't do this. If you have a problem with a mailing list, contact the
administrator and not the hundreds of people who are here to discuss VWs.

Well perhaps I am not sure who the &quot;administrator&quot; is.  And perhaps that is
what the &quot;Subject&quot; field is for on E-mails.  I do not read all of the 100
posts I get every day, I first check sucjects that interest me and I delete
all the ones that don't.  Try it.
