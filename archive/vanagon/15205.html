SStones...

I can offer you a spot down near our beach to camp out on.._dot_use
our facilities in the house...or you could probably camp out
at Horseneck Beach State Reservation...right on the ocean.

On May 7, LiMBO is having one of their gatherings called the Rites
of Spring, at Duxbury Beach from 10 am to 4 pm. Duxbury is near
Plymouth, MA.  If you want more info on Rites of Spring call
Scott _at_ (508) 746-9573.
