Subject: more hp when outside temp drops?

Hi all,
just a quick question to the air cooled owners. I have a '77 westy bought it
in early Aug, when Georgia was 100f every day and night. It has finanly
cooled off here and it seems to me that I am getting better hp, could this
be and have you noticed it on yours?
My other theory is that now that I not so concerned about overheating I am
driving it a bit more aggresively ( a very relative term in a a/c bus).
Peace,       &quot;Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand and say's 
Scoob         Don't you see, got to make some how, on the dreams you still
believe,
              Don't give it up, you got an empty cup,
              Only love will fill, only love will fill&quot;
              Jerry Garcia
