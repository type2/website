    Bleed the brakes, don't wait around to do it. Brakes
    are important...

&gt; &gt; My '78 (Murray) is braking rather irregularly these days. After long
&gt; &gt; highway sections (infrequent braking) the brake pedal sinks rather
&gt; &gt; close to the floor without producing much stopping power. The problem
&gt; &gt; is resolved after a pump or two when brake pressure is returned. I
&gt; &gt; thought at first that I had some air in the brake lines, so I bled them
&gt; &gt; without any favourable results (no significant air bubbles produced).
&gt; &gt; Next Bentley says that these conditions could be caused by the rear
&gt; &gt; shoes being out of adjustment. After adjustment everything worked great
&gt; &gt; for a few weeks. Now the problem is gradually returning. The lack of
&gt; &gt; pressure on first stomp of the brake pedal is very noticeable when
&gt; &gt; driving on rough roads i.e., gravel logging roads. On the rough surface
&gt; &gt; (very dusty too) the pedal will often bottom out without significant
&gt; &gt; braking effect. A couple pumps on the pedal produces the desired effect
&gt; &gt; (slowing down!).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any ideas? Do I need to adjust the rear shoes again?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any advice!
&gt; 
&gt; Well, this will be a typically fast 'net reply...NOT!!  Interesting 
&gt; question, freaky problem, so I thought I'd try to get this thread rolling.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, have you been losing brake fluid?  Any wetness anywhwere in the 
&gt; braking system that might indicate a leak in the system?  Wheel 
&gt; cylinders, master cylinders, couplings in the lines?  Check the whole 
&gt; length of the lines, too, since you may have chucked a rock or something 
&gt; up on the logging roads and damaged something.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be freaking if my pedal would drop to the floor every now and then!
&gt; 
&gt; Any other info you could add to your description?  Any other ideas out there?
