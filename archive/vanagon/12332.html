Subject: RE: Broken Speedo

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Only thing unique is that the speedo went too -- usually just the odo dies.
&gt;&gt;My experience -- and other posts -- indicate that only VDO speedo repair
&gt;&gt;places can get the parts, so it doesn't matter how easy or hard it is.

I saw lots of VW wabbit, jedda, golf, bug and old vans in you pick kind
of junkyards. There may be a chance these cars share some exactly same gears
inside their odometers. In you pick junkyards if you take a odometer
in bad shape (just the look, all gears are in good shape), it will probably
cost you less than $10.
