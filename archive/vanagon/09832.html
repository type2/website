Subject: I'm Still here in San Jose (was CA flooding

Well as I mentiomed before, I roadtripped to San Jose
for this Cisco class.  Still here ond boy sdoes it rain
up here.

Mr. Swartze - do you have a white falia?  I passed one
around 14:00 on hwy 101 and it looked like it was
someone that had hust been camping (it was loaded up
with stuff).  Also I passed approx 10 VW vans on the way
up 101 and gave the thumbs up to each one as we passed.
NOT ONE PERSON RESPONDED OR EITHER DIDN&quot;T NOTICE MY
FALIA HEADING THE OTHER PASSED THEM.  These people shouldn't
be allowed to have VW VANS.

-SCOTT.
81 'falia
