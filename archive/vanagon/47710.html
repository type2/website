Subject: Possible solution and thanks

	Well I must thank you all very very much for all your help and
great suggestions as to what the problem is with the ol Mystery Machine. It
sure earned its name on this little episode.
	After a sleepless night I promptly called the shop as soon as it
was open. Henry had been there early working on it and he thinks that the
catalytic converter may be the root of the problem. If the converter is all
clogged or bunked up (for lack of a better term) then it'll send a false
reading back to the o2 sensor, hence the problem.
	Anyhow, he'll call back when the verdicts in, and I'll be sure to
post this little dosey ASAP.

thanks again, youve all earned 10 karma points. Redemable wherever, and
whenever.
