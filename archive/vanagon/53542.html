Subject: J.B. Weld - non Vanagon.

That JB Weld is some tough stuff.  I noted where list members used it in
repairing pitted heads.  I had a problem with a JD diesel tractor - the
splines in the coupling for the front  PTO was stripped out.  It couples the
PTO to an oil pump for hydrolics.  I took off the coupling and cleaned it out
real good with solvent. Then I mixed some JBW. and applied about 1/16&quot; coat
on the inside of the coupling and left harden.  I applied another batch - a
little thicker this time and left harden.  Next day I filled new splines with
a triangular file in the JBW.  Reattached the coupling - and it works great.
 Got the JBW at Wal M___.
