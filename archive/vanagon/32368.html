&gt;How about running a long hose, the length of the van,  from the mouth of the
&gt;carb up to a bracket positioned to the area right near the driver's head.
&gt;When the tachometer nears 3500RPM the driver could simply blow real hard
&gt;into the tube (ala breathometer) and increase the psi to the desired volume

this is Dangerous!!!  just imagine if the driver has been drinking! you'd
be putting overpressured and alcohol-saturated air into the intake system,
in effect creating an alcohol-fueled dragracer that would leap out of control
and race down the strip ... er, highway at heretofore unheardof speeds (well,
for a vw bus, anyway). and don't forget that when you get drunks to blow hard
for any length of time, they tend to get lightheaded and pass out from lack
of oxygen!

so you've just designed an Unguided Street Missle ...  :)

&gt;passanger(s) to become more than just ballast on long trips. The options are

oh, geez! multiple drunks pressurizing the carb with alcohol fumes! and just
what, pray tell, are you gonna do if one of the &quot;pressure-passengers&quot; happens
to be a bit toooooo deep into his cups, and some half-digested pizza goes
down the carb!???

do internal combustion engines run on tomato sauce???

:)

what we have here, is the late-90's equivalent of telephone-booth-stuffing!!
just imagine the competition between social groups! wow.
