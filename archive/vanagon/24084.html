Yo,

	Well, just got back from Bug O Rama.  I left a little early 'cause
I had to pick the SO up at SMO.  Too bad, too, cause I still had money left!

	I bought:

a bubble taillight to replace the ailing one ($60 - a decent deal) 
A long window latch ($10 - decent) 
A steering column lock ($45 - OK/soso deal)
A set of H5 lights for the 911 ($100 - good deal)
A set of headlights for the bus, $20 - seemed like a good deal
3 engine governors, $12 for the set.  Don't know how they work, though.
Barndoor jesus handle, good popout window frame, $17
Notchback Trim piece for engine lid - $5
2 Bus ventilation covers $2
set of seat belts (2) $20A

There was some stuff that i couldn't believe the prices they were charging!

Ie: set of bubble tailights, good condition, $300
reflector and bulb holder for center brake light, $75
sunroof latch handle, (crusty) $65

Now get this one:

A bus ventilation cover with some old-looking grateful dead stickers:
Hang on to your hat, $800!!  No, thats not a mis-print!

I'm beginning to recognize some of the people selling stuff now, and using 
that to my advantage: the guy I bought the bubble taillight wanted $80 in
june, and wouldn't come down, allegedly had osmeone else who was gonna 
buy it, just had ot go get the cash.  Well, today, I sez &quot;Looks like you're
still stuck with that light.  Didn't sell it eh?  I've give you $50&quot; so we
settled on $60.  Another lady wanted $5 EACH for used knobs for wiper and
light switches! (same betty as the sunroof handle, BTW)  I got a set of
3 knobs and 2 handle backingpieces for $5!

The one I wanna work next time is the guy with the ambulance fan: he wants
$230 for it.

Oh, and I got a radio block off plate for $20  Nice shape, though! Sheesh
thats still kinda expensive for a part that was designed to be thrown away!
