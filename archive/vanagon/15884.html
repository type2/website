Subject: Re: mpg, was Retro-f. F.I.

Hey chill, Jim. I was driving while blind drunk, smoking a big &quot;fattie&quot;, and 
wearing nothing but a pair of glasses with the eyeballs hanging out on springs 
while I wrote that. And god-damn, did it feel good.

And Mad Dog is way better than Night Train anyway.

I like this list because we are all weird, bizarre, and anal in our own special 
way. Net-kids, please back me up on this.

Actually, good point Jim. Now back to our regularly scheduled anality...

&gt; &gt;OK OK, I can't stand it. I promised myself that I would lurk for awhile but
&gt; Jeez. Would somebody pleeze get a life! If this list was in action 25-30
&gt; years ago the typical VW bus owner wouldn't care what week it was much less
&gt; being so anal that you'd worry about .2 mpg! Drive the bus and stop
&gt; worrying. You are going to get ulcers wondering about inane things like
&gt; this. I have never flamed anyone in my life but some one pushed a button I
&gt; guess. Go camping. Go fishing, disconnect the odometer. Go get a bottle of
&gt; &quot;Night Train&quot;, ask your kid for a joint and whip out the old Sam Kinison
&gt; video and chill. If you're joking then I grabbed it hook line and sinker.
&gt; Whew, I needed that. (Anybody have a Spice rack?)

&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't engine friction generally decrease (until the tail-end of the 
&gt; engine's 
&gt; &gt;life anyway) as time goes on? The mileage on our Jetta has gone up 1-2 mph 
&gt; &gt;gradually in the nearly 4 years that we've owned it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This has been discussed thoroughly last fall. Here's my experience:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1980 Vanagon with Pop top, 2.0l F.I., Man. Trans., no extras
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -&gt; 15-17 mpg on short trips
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -&gt; up to 22 or 23 mpg on long highway runs (60-65 mph)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; well, see, i'm getting a little worried about my bus. the mpg has been 
&gt; &gt; going
&gt; &gt;&gt; UP for the last 16,000 miles. to such an extent that the AVERAGE for 
&gt; &gt; 86,000
&gt; &gt;&gt; miles has risen 0.2 mpg. now, to me, that's a lot (for the long term 
&gt; &gt; average)
&gt; &gt;&gt; ... and it worries me. for years, it plodded along at 19.4 average. now 
&gt; &gt; it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; creeped up to 19.6 and gives every indication of going to 19.7 this 
&gt; &gt; summer.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; yeah, i know: don't look a gift horse in the mouth. but this bothers me,
&gt; &gt;&gt; if it was going down, then i'd know something was wrong and i'd had some
&gt; &gt;&gt; ideas. but this! i don't think i'm driving that much slower. i don't think
&gt; &gt;&gt; i'm driving any less in town. the ONLY thing i can connect to this is that 
&gt; &gt; i
&gt; &gt;&gt; started using those Bosch triple-electrode plugs just about the time the 
&gt; &gt; mpg
&gt; &gt;&gt; started going up a little. ??? coincidence?? maybe the plugs just suit my
&gt; &gt;&gt; driving style better? maybe the old plugs were that much wrong??
&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe they've done something to the gasoline around here? maybe my bus is
&gt; &gt;&gt; really a Democrat?? ;)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!! old folks hate change!! :)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; anyway, i'm getting up to 21-22 on the highway now. and 17-18 in town.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; subject to change without notice.
