Here's an update:

The knocking sound came back.  It wouldn't stay away.  It was found on the 
porch the very next day.

So today I replaced one of the joints which I think was bad.  So far I 
haven't heard it ( is there a slow echo in here ;-) ).

Got an update myself...the wheel bearings are also shot.  These are 'spensive bearings, friends...

You might want to pull and check those too, mebbe that will put these knocks of ours to bed permanently, eh?
