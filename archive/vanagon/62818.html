Hi folks,

        I'm looking for assistance with my &quot;new&quot; Westfalia.  I can do basic
maintance but would like to do more.  I also need a general orientation to
the engine and other systems.  Volunteer or paid, All depends on what you
want and what we will get into.  
        The catch is that I am legaly blind so hands on instruction is much
better then manuals.
