Subject: Re: Stuck Parking Brake

Jim,

You hit the nail right on the head.  Although Vancouver is not known for
being rainy (he said sarcastically), ...   You have described the conditions
under which this happened and the exact reaction of the parking brake. It
rained last night and again this morning the brake was stuck on, although
not to the same degree as last time.   I will try your remedy and see what
happens.  I will let you know the outcome.

Funnily enough my last vehicle was an 87 Acura.  The parking brake seized on
several occasions but the problem evolved much differently.  My wife thinks
I yank on the handle too hard.

Thanks again.

&gt;First, I'll start by telling you about your weather.  It was raining when you
&gt;parked the van and you drove through several puddles on that last drive.  
&gt;
&gt;When this happens, rust can quickly build up on the inside of the drum and
&gt;bond the shoe to the drum.  I'm not certain if this affects other vehicles,
&gt;but it's happend to my 87 Syncro a couple of times.  This can happen
&gt;overnight, and a mild case can happen (where you feel the resistance and
&gt;then, THUNK, it unsticks) just during a day at work.  It certainly hasn't
&gt;happened to any other vehicle I've driven.  In order to prevent it, I ride
&gt;the brake just a bit before I park, hoping to heat up the drum enough to
&gt;eliminate as much water as possible before parking.  I can't say for sure
&gt;that this works, but I haven't had this happen since I've started doing this.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,

&gt;&gt; My first problem with my Westy (91).  I went to leave the driveway today
&gt;and couldn't move a bit.  I determined one of the right rear wheel was
&gt;locked.  I jacked it up, pulled the wheel off and wacked the wheel with a
&gt;hammer a few times.  It's good as new for now but I am afraid it will
happen &gt;again.
&gt;  Can anyone suggest any preventative maintainance for this affliction?
