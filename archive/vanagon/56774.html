Subject: Cruise Control on '90 Westy Not working

Last week I purchased a '90 Westfalia. After taking care of a couple of
problems ( clock and glove box light disconnected, after market stereo
not hooked up nicely), I notice that my cruise control won't set. It
definitely worked before I started messing with all the electrical
stuff. I also removed the seat belt/door buzzer. I assume I disconnted
maybe a relay that controls the cruise control or something. 

Since I don't yet have my service manual, can somebody please tell me
which relay (if any) is the cruise control? Which fuse is the cruise on?
Any other trouble shooting hints would greatly be appreciated. 

Thanks,

Jeff
