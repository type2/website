Subject:      New Alloys! FS AC Condensers too!

Listees,

  I have a source for New A/C condensers for the price of $120.00!
There are only a few of these but I remember some people looking for
these units a month or so ago.  If you need one let me know!

  Alloys!

  I have 25 sets of EuroSpec alloys that were designed for Vanagons.
They use the OE lugs and are 15&quot; ONLY.  6.5 BY 15 is the spec on these
wheels.

  I'm selling them for $160.00 each Plus S&amp;H.  The desingn is called
&quot;Rhein&quot;, they're a 5 spoke type wheel and are a quality product.

  If interested contact me via e-mail or by phone 1:00-5:00PST.

  Kyle
