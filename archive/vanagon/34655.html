Subject:      Re: EV Resister

Last summer I had the same problem as Trace is having now, except it
was not caught until the pressure built up so high in the A/C/ system
that the system blew when my totally frazzled wife and the 2 young boys
were at a Dunkin Donuts in Attleboro.

The problem was a failure of the ballast resister for the high-speed
radiator fan. I just got off the phone with the Head Mechanic at the
local VW dealer. He said that there are three ballast resisters located
behind the driver's headlight. One for the hi-speed fan, one for the
low-speed fan, and another. Trace, one of the first two (probably the
hi-speed) is bad.

The bill for fixing our blown A/C was over $600., but since we were just past
the 2 year warranty, this mechanic persuaded the factory rep to cover 3/4
of the cost. My GE extended warranty picked up the rest.

Good luck Trace!
