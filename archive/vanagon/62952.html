Subject: Re: Which Subaru engine?

&gt;For what it is worth, I also thing the legacy engine would make a better
&gt;choice.  Correct me if I am wrong but did the 6 cylinder come only in the
&gt;SVX?  If so you will have to consider the avaliability and cost of the
&gt;engine and replacement parts.  Not to mention, the strain on the drive 
&gt;train, you will also need a brake system upgrade to stop the
&gt;shoe box when you are doing 100+ with 7 people, while pulling the trailer
&gt;and the A/C blasting. Also subaru no longer produces the SUX?
&gt;
Forget to mention fuel consumption?  Single digit MPG results are not funy.
 Better throw in a new, larger tank in that list of modifications.
