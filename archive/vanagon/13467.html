Subject:       Ignition Wires...

Good morning all.  I'm getting the van ready to commence camping next 
week, and now that she's all cleaned up, detailed to the max, 
polished, waxed, and most gear in place, I decided to check over 
the ignition leads after detailing the engine.

I'm not sure what this means, so I am hoping that someone on the list 
can give me a hand here.

I measured the resistance of the coil to distrib. wire at 1000 ohms.  
Bentley says 2000 -+800.  The spark plug leads measured at 3500 ohms, 
and Bentley says 6000 -+1000.  These measurements are from end to end 
which includes the resistors.

Since the resistance I am getting is approx half of what it should 
be, is this good, bad or OK?  Is it time to get new wires?  The van 
has 112500 km (70000 miles) on it, and is 5 years old.  My 
multi-meter isn't the best in the world, but I'm sure it couldn't be 
that far out (I properly calibrated it, etc).

BTW, the stock wires are made by BREMI of Germany.  I thought they 
would have been Bosch wires, but not so on my van.

Thanks for any advice.

Harry.
