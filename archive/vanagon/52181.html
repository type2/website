Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

hmm...about the ideas of accually using ENGINE compression to inflat the 
tire, 
 know this subject has been broached before, but, then they were accually 
talking about building compressors out of engines, so..


anyhow, the little gadgets like the one guy has &lt;and Muir describes&gt; uses 
OUTSIDE AIR to fill tire. unlike say,m a compression tester, and a tire 
valve fitting. The later would introduce into your tire the SAME mizture 
of fuel you use to dirve your car...think about this one for a momnt, 
gas, air, heat....poof...bye bye tire...anyhow...

just my 3 cents again...

&gt; So what ever happened to St Muirs super, screw into the spark plug pump
&gt; anybody know?  I think he detailed it as some sort of impulse thing
&gt; seperated from the actual cylinder charge but why not use one engine
&gt; cylinder itself instead, not a bad idea as disabling gas to one
&gt; cylinder a joke with FI.  One VW cylinder pumping is more than anyone
&gt; would ever need along with a good piece of hose, in fact maybe worth
&gt; a roll your own try using the remains of a $15 compression tester 
&gt; combined to a quick disconnect and then a piece of air hose.  Thoughts
&gt; anyone?  This is academic for a diesel owner unfortunately.
