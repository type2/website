Subject: Re: VR6 in a Vanagon?

Saw a bus ('70s ?) with a Chevy V6 (2.6 or 2.8...maybe out of 
Citation or something) at Maple Grove.  They built a special 
enclosure that stuck out of the rear of the bus.  No additional 
height though.

&gt; Some guys near Cologne did this swap. I found an article in 'VW Scene'.
&gt; Not very technical, but there is a picture showing the engine inside
&gt; the engine compartment. It extends about 20 cm above the bay lid. But
&gt; the mechanic had to built an own adapterplate to fit the engine and
&gt; bellhousing. Not an easy choice of an engine swap.
