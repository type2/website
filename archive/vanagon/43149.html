Subject: '83 Westie questions

        Greetings once again. Just a couple quick questions about by '83.
When I was camping on the weekend I actually got to make use of all the
curtains finally, as well as the large back bug screen. However, I was left
with two small rectangualr bug screens that I did not know where to attach
to. There definetly wasnt anywhere that really looked like it could use
them, but obviously they do go somewhere.....but where?

        Also, when steering, and I make a big turn, theres kind of a metal
against metal sound coming from the steering wheel. Its not a grating
annoying hideous sound, but theres obviously something going on in there.
Any suggestions?

         Also, I called the dealer in regards to purchasing the black
rubber strip that runs on the bottom of the pop top as mine is beginning to
peel off and he told me that there are none around at all. Has anyone else
replaced this, and if so where did you get it from and how was it to
replace?

        And lastly (finally eh?) I need floor mats for both the driver and
passenger side but VW wants $125 for them, and they only have them in
blue...which will not do (poet, but didnt know it). Have any of you
wonderful people found other mats that fit properly or will I have to
resort to buying some generic ones and cutting them to fit?
