Subject: Awning/Screenhouse - Revisited

Hi Folks ....
Some of you may remember I was asking for participants to help me
in a, scavenger hunt to find an awning/screenhouse to fit my Eurovan.

Well this is a follow-up.

With some leads from some of you, I was able to be enough of a bother to my
local RV dealer that he had his people FIND one that would most-nearly fit
and then fabricated brackets to mount the unit in the space between the pop-up
and the sliding door. It looks great.

We just got back from a weekend (testing the unit of course). Now I know I
was right-on with the idea and still wonder why no manufacturer picked up
on this.

For those of you with Eurovan pop-up campers ... come-on in the benefits
are great!

What I got was an awning that telescopes to give a 6ft X 10ft cover,
mainly over the sliding door. The unit has self-contained legs. It's
now convenient to stop nearly anywhere, anytime and be able to rest
in the shade.

Additionally, I got an ADD-A-ROOM kit that comes in five segments:
     Wheel skirt
     Draft/bug deflector/skirt
     Front &amp; Rear screen/privacy panels
     Main/Entrance screen/panel

The room fits together (snaps, zippers &amp; support bars) to create a fully
enclosed room. After placing a tarp on the ground, I had a decent-sized
tent covering the opening to the van.

As an experiment, I ran the van's A/C for a few minutes ... the entire area
was noticably cooled even thought the van was parked in a sunny spot. The
flexibility with the room/tent is that there are individual panels that
can be left down or rolled up to allow air flow through the screens.

If you cant't tell ... I like it!!!!
