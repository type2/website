Early bus spotting on this side of the water. 

This morning the mail arrived and along with he usual assortment of bills &amp;
fliers came the latest issue of our local club newsletter. On the front is a
beautiful reprint of Keetman'9s &quot;6A Week at the VW Factory&quot;9 with a line up of
early splits: mirrors cocked into a weird shipping and no front turn
indicators.
	 Anyway, flipping through the pages I came to a photo taken at a recent meet
down in Germany. You know that feeling that your looking at something that
just ain'9t right, yet you can'9t quite put your finger on it. Well the picture
shows a beautify '963 Samba with a one piece front windshield. Weird &amp;
wonderful. The text says the guy owning this, imported it from Brazil. Any
ideas about this? Was it a one off to test things to come, or what?
	Across the page is a photo of a local member who picked up a 1954 Samba bus
in very very rough shape, no transmission and no motor. Better pictures of it
were shown in recent issue of Volks World. 
	A last photo shows a another weird concoction. This is a Karman built moble
home. Looks like a late model type 2 rear ended right up to the back of the
drivers seat by a small trailer.
