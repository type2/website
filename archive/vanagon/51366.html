Subject: Start &amp; Go (or no quick escape!)

Thanks to everyone-trip in our &quot;new&quot; '85 Westy a big success.  Also cudos 
to my VW mechanic who is really a race boat mechanic!
Now to another problem:  Cold start, hard to get to idle on its own until 
about 30 seconds.  No matter what you do, you can't put it into gear and 
leave.  Ususlly you have to stall at least twice and restart, no trouble 
starting.  I notice this will also happen on a hot start like after going 
in for that quick cup of morning coffee on the road.  Could this be a 
fuel pump problem?  Seems like if you let it set for more than about 5 
minutes you have the problem-like when you are gassing up.  Any ideas?
