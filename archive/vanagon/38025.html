In a message dated 96-03-19 04:00:27 EST, you write:

&gt;Could these pipes be extra heat air intakes?  I
&gt;wouldn't think they would be because they are open at the rear of the
&gt;van, near the exhaust pipe.  What else could they be?  Does anyone else
&gt;have anything like this on their bus?  I don't get it.
&gt;
&gt;any ideas &amp; suggestions are appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Sean
these extra ports are to reroute unused heat in the summer so that the
starter didn't cook needlessly.  Also, on the automatics, it helped not to
have the (air-cooled) torque converter trying to cool itself with already hot
air.
