Subject: [T2] Ponderous motor thoughts...


&gt;I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
&gt;fit in my '79 Bust.  If it would fit, is it a bolt up, plug in the Bus FI
&gt;stuff and go job or something worse.  The guy says 'Runs well, $250.'  Is
&gt;this a good idea or should I invest $250 in the motor I currently have.  I

(a) You could rebuild yours well for $250.

(b) I'd bet you an additional $50 that they guy is lying, because,

(c) There is a magazine for Porschephiles. I forget what it's called,
&quot;Elegance&quot; or &quot;Bumptiousness&quot; or &quot;Excellence&quot; or something like that. Look
for it near the other car mags but over toward the yachting. You know how
they are.

Like the the other magazines devoted solely to the pursuit of vanity (read:
women's magazines) the nameless Porsche mag is filled with countless ads
and virtually no articles. So there you can check prices for carburetors
and rebuilds and heater boxes ($600--they're stainless) and other things.
Why would he sell a good Porsche engine for $250 when the case alone is
worth far more than that?

Don't mean to discourage you, maybe his baby needs shoes, maybe he's into
nose candy, maybe it's true. I'd probably go look. But beware the
ancillaries. ;)
