You can get platinum plugs at K-Mart for $8/4. I put in K-
Mart's(Bosch) number 4116 which corresponds to the W7 series.
I did find that the information at the store was
contradictory. The listing for the later Vanagons didn't show
and plugs. However, when I cross referenced with the Porsche
I found that there was a platinum plug.

I then checked with the dealer, who of course, didn't have a
listing but did know that it was the W7 series.

I checked with NAPA and they had them,too, at the same price.

I took my original plugs out and they were eroded to 0.047&quot;
from a setting of 0.028&quot; but seemed to run OK. This is at 40K
miles.

I had platinum in my Taurus and at 60K they looked like new!

Since the Van turns almost twice the rev/mile, I imagine the
platinum will go close to 50K without any worry and probably
much farther.
