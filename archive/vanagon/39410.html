Jim,

there is a FREE trip or route planner on the web...its
MAPQUEST.COM

You enter the starting city and the ending city (has to be in the US tho)
and it calculates mileage and gives you directions as well.

If you plug in your street address, city, county, state it will draw a map 
and show you where your house is located.
