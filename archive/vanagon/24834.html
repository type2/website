Subject: RE: Idle problems



&gt;    After replacing the transmission in my '71 camper, resetting the
&gt;points and the timing, I have found I have a problem with the idle.
&gt;The idle is set at around 850 rpm and normally runs fine apart from
&gt;when comeing to a fairly rapid stop at lights and such, when it cuts
&gt;out. Does anyone have any suggestions? I can't quite figure this one
&gt;out. Thanks in advance.

Mine did that, among other things. I found a hole in the little one-way
valve in the vacuum line that runs fron the intake naifold, all the way
forward to the poer brake servo. Replaced the valve (aftermarket--
VW doesn't make  them any more, but you might find NOS if you try),
and still have a few problems. Tomorrow I will replace the hoses that go
to the line-- several people tell me that these are common trouble spots
in '71s.

I've also heard, that ordinary heater hose works-- I don't have to use
the hugely expensive ribbed vacuum hose, so the story goes. I will get
the 1/2&quot; heater hose, and give it a try. It IS pretty stout looking.

My $0.02. Good luck!

P.S. to check if this is your problem, pull off the garden-hose looking
thing attached to your intake manifold. It should have a little can-shaped
thing pretty close to the manifold-- the one-way valve. Clean off the
end of the hose you pulled off the manifold, and suck on it gently.
(Careful-- I found brake fluid in mine, which is poisonous). You should
feel a pretty good vacuum seal, like you're sucking on the top of a
half-full Coke bottle.

Another check: get a short length of half-inch new hose, put a thick bolt
or something in one end to plug it (Use a clamp), and put it on the
manifold tap you just pulled the garden hose off of. Then try to drive
the car, and see if the idle is more consistent. But be careful-- the
brakes will be VERY stiff-- you'll have to push the pedal HARD to stop.
Those front disc brakes are wonderful-- but real bears without power.
You may have to readjust the idle to try this for real, if someone had
adjusted it while you had a vacuum leak.
