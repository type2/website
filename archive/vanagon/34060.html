68' F, here in Phoenix; I don't know about where you are . . .  8)

&gt;        ...the first thing I hear:  &quot;A body was found inside of a
&gt;Volkswagen van... Oakland county officials have not said yet whether &gt;they
suspect that Dr. Jack Kervorkian was involved...&quot;

Yes I saw it as well. . .it was a white Westy, probably early to mid '70s
