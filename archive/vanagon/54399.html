Subject: Re:Vanagon Things and Sainthood

&gt; &gt;Ron makes the money, not someone
&gt; &gt;else, if you think this is good so be it. None of us are saints, but $68
&gt; &gt;for a Bentley manual does not qualify him as one either.
&gt; 
&gt; Just to correct a factual error, the price for the Bentley Vanagon manual
&gt; is $62 (plus postage), not $68.  This *is*, in fact, lower than anyone
&gt; else's advertised price.  Not that this qualifies me for sainthood... You are both right! Neither condition qualifies a person for &quot;sainthood&quot;. In fact the 
Bible states that saints are those who believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and 
Savior. Reference 1 COR 1:2 and 1 PET 1:2. Therefore only those who confess Jesus 
Christ as their Lord and Savior and turn from their sin are saints! JOH 3:16. As a 
matter of fact, the Bentley manual is mentioned nowhere in the Bible, (try and find 
it!).
