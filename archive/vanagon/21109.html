Subject: Re: Awning/tent fabric

 
&gt; Can anyone suggest where I might look for tent/awning grade canvas?
&gt; 
&gt; I've checked the local fabric stores but they only carry very light stuff.
&gt; In orange with pink stripes?!?!?!

If you are anywhere near a yachting area, there are all kinds of sail 
lofts and canvas awning places. They always have all kinds of material
for awnings and boat covers.

The yellow pages for Newport (RI) lists over ten sail lofts/custom awning
places geared to the boating crowd.
