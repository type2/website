To All:

A recent exchange of messages on the Vanagon list implies that I've been
driven off the list as a result of intimidation or an over-abundance of
'whiners'.  

In so far as I know, I'm still subscribed to the Vanagon list, although I
shut off the mail before leaving for Baja a couple of months ago -- and
haven't turned it back on :-)

The simple truth is that I don't have much experience with water-cooled
Volkswagens and the Vanagon list has an ample supply of experts.  Indeed,
hardly a week goes by without a new one cropping up :-)

'Whiners' came from some other pen, it isn't a term I'd normally use.  People
who experience obscure mechanical problems often become frustrated and that
frustration sometimes leaks out through the keyboard but that's a normal
thing -- I've heard a lot of frustrated people asking for help.  I can't say
I've heard too many whiners.

I think the real question has to do with the content of the various VW
mailing lists.   I'm not a bitchin' sano OEM resto phreak.  I don't collect
toys.  I don't watch TV.  I'm not a used car salesman (or saleswoman).  And I
don't use underwear you have to read.  Those subjects or some variation,
account for about 90% of recent list traffic.  I don't see anything wrong in
the lists content but neither do I see much of interest.

As to being intimidated, I guess you'll have to work that one out for
yourselves.
