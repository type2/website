Subject: Re: Help - 84 Westy inside sliding door handle screw

&gt;I lost the screw which holds the interior handle for the sliding
&gt;door on. I will just go to the hardware store to buy a new one,
&gt;however I would really like to know the proper dimensions of the
&gt;screw.  Does anyone have a manual which would list that part?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

I lost the same on my '81. Actually purchased one from the dealer for less
than one dollar a couple of years ago. I couldn't believe VW carried a part
for less than a buck.
