(if you hate pointless ramblimgs, skip this one)

	I made some new seat belt hangers today, a couple pieces of 
AL strip, some 18-8 Flat head socket cap screws, and nylon acorn nuts.
Sandblasted them and then sprayed them with silicone spray to seal them.
 
	Use your imagination; they are quite stylish and hopefully people
will use them instead of futilely trying to slam the latch between my
door and door jamb.
 
	Impressed by the wonderful outcome of the project, I decided to see if
I could get my sliding door to actually shut without some kind of divine intervention.
I popped off the inner panel to lube up the release cable, then lubed up the
latch rod thing, which helped somewhat.
 
	The fun part was pulling apart the rear track roller and shimming
the worn parts with a Coke can.  The door works better than it ever has, and
sounds like a real door.  Next week I'm taking it apart again, taking it to
work a putting in good brass bushings, reaming them, and making a new
nylon glide block. 
 
	So Friday went super great, other than my un friendly non local sysadmin
telling me I needed to delete my .forward file I use to deliver information and
news on mtn. bike Trials to the world &quot;as soon as conveinent&quot;. bleh.
(insert some phrase containing many explexitives here) 45 sad people,
including myself.
 
	Tomorrow I'm going to try and find some tubing so as to hook up the
cool air blower, as winter will soon be upon us here in the Great Corn State,
and maybe, just maybe, try to reset my rear suspension.
 
	I feel the urge for a Vandering coming on.....

(end of pointless rambling, thanks)
