Subject: Oil Change Question

Some odd things happened when I did my regular oil service on my '85 
Vanagon today.  When I pulled the oil filter after draining the oil, 
a lot of oil came out with the filter--more than I think is normal.  
It was as if the oil passage close to the filter flange was 'holding' 
oil or something.  When I installed the filter and added 4 quarts of 
synthetic and started the engine it took at least a minute for the 
oil light to go out.  I turned the engine off and on a few times for 
fear that the engine would be starved of lubrication.  I'm used to a bit of a delay after an oil 
change, but this seemed excessive.  The engine is almost new, a 
remanufactured unit from VW of Canada installed around 15,000 miles ago last 
January, and has been flawless.

Once the engine finally developed sufficient oil pressure, now on 
restarting, the oil light goes out immediately.

I checked the oil and found that it was almost a quart low after 
adding the initial four quarts--I usually add the additional 1/2 
quart after starting the engine, checking for leaks and then checking 
oil level.

Is this odd, or am I being hypersensitive.
