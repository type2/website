-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's nine o' clock, I'm in the garage
I started the bus, drove it in
There's a toolkit sittin' next to me
Ready to help me put the heads in.

Spouse says, &quot;Are you working on that thing again?&quot;
I say, &quot;Have to, to make it go!&quot;
I've got this thing beat and the engine's complete
Hopefully, the end of my woes.

La la de da, a la de da da dum ...
I sing a song, I'm Bus Repair Man
A new song every night
And workin' on my bus is a joy to me,
'Specially when she's working all right

Ron of the Depot is a friend of mine:
He gets me my parts for cheap
If your engine croaks or starts to spit black smoke,
Then he's really the man you should see.

He says, &quot;The type2 list really does help me,&quot;
A smile drew itself across his face;
&quot;I'm sure that we all would not be where we are
If not for the folks in this place.&quot;

La la de da, a la de da da dum ...
I sing a song, I'm Bus Repair Man
A new song every night
And workin' on my bus is a joy to me,
'Specially when she's working all right

And Paul is a government scientist
Who posts to the list every night
And he's talking with Davy, who paints his Dub navy,
And has been a 'Dub fan for life

And someone's planning yet another meet,
I search for a bus to call my own,
And we're sharing a thing we call Dubbin', yes -
It's much better than driving alone

La la de da, a la de da da dum ...
I sing a song, I'm Bus Repair Man
A new song every night
And workin' on my bus is a joy to me,
'Specially when she's working all right

I've done a pretty good job this Saturday
As I close up my toolbox and smile;
'Cause I know that it's me that does the upkeep
To forget about life for a while.

And the engine sounds like a pussycat,
The paint looks like it's just been waxed up,
As I close things up tight and turn out the light,
I fall in love again with my Bus.
