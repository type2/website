Hey Now, 
 
My name is Kirk Leach.  I just bought a sweet '77 pop-top Campmobile that
will be residing with me here in Pelham, NY.  It has the complete deluxe
interior with stove, refrigerator, even air-conditioning (which I haven't
used yet other than to check to see that it works). 
 
The PO bought it from the original owner (Florida resident) about a year
ago. PO is a bus fanatic as was the original owner so the bus is in amazing
shape - no rust or bondo.  The engine is a rebuilt Porsche with 50,000
miles on it. 
 
I'm new to all this and, frankly, don't know much about vehicle
maintenance.  I did have a '68 Bus (that was rusting away) about 8 years
ago and I did a few things with it like replacing the brakes.  I am reading
up with all the resources mentioned in the FAQ. 
 
I am missing the stool/cooler that fits between the two front seats so if
anyone has one of those please let me know. 
 
That's all for now.  Looking forward to learning and having fun on this
list.  If there is anyone in the area who has a similar vehicle and wants
to get together please let me know. 
 
Peace, 
Kirk
