i thought the phrase was from the &quot;houses&quot; on Luststrasse, whereupon those
Ladies of the Night ply their ancient trade ... and the phrase was used by
the customers. meaning &quot;Hand over my Genitals!!!&quot;. :)  but i like your
translation as well. made my day. :)

&gt;there are many japanese cars with seats which cause my genitals to itch

i find that certain japanese cars, while being of Fine Quality, do cause
certain small floppy parts of my anatomy to &quot;swap sides&quot; on my ... most
