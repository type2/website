Subject: Best way to remove rust on pan?

I've noticed some tiny amounts of rust building up in the corners where the
cross members meet the pan on my 78 Westy. Any suggestions as to the way to
remove this best? I have thought of a quick sandblast or bead blast, then
some Extend rust treatment, followed by undercoat. How have others treated
this problem? Thanks!!
regards,
C.
