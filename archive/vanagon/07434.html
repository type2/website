&gt; I liked it so much I used the Revell 1:25 Transporter kit to build a

I want this model kit!  Is it still available?  Got a part number?

Also - I made a Corel DRAW approximation of the Fukengruven bumper sticker, and 
would be happy to email it as an attachemnt to anyone who can take attachments.
