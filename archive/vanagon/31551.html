Steve, you misunderstood the intent of my poorly written comment! I meant 
to ask if someone with more experience than ME would validate MY 
comments. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I've been a little confused on 
this. Obviously!

Bob Hoover replied to me privately; I'll forward his reply off list FYI.
You are obviously correct in your understanding of how the air vanes
operate.  Though I was trying to be helpful, I was obviously still a
little confused. 

Sorry for my poorly worded request. It wasn't intended to be a comment on 
YOUR experience, but rather MINE.

&gt; I wasn't implying that the flaps close when the temp gets colder.  I 
&gt; meant that they adjust to the cold temperature.  Sometimes, that means
&gt; they are going to close a little so that the air will 'warm' to optimum
&gt; operating temperature.
&gt; 
&gt; Ugh!!!
