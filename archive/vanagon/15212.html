Subject: restraint in postings

Joshua says:
&gt;Once you advocate restraint, or enforce it, it can no longer be called
&gt;&quot;open dialogue&quot;. It becomes &quot;moderated discussion&quot; either if the authors
&gt;moderate it, or someone else does.

I have to disagree here.  Restraint is entirely appropriate.  Dialogue
without restraint would degenerate into a brawl.  I didn't see the
offending post, but there are plenty of places on and off the net to
be offensive.
