Subject: change of seasons,  tighten those clamps

ooofta!  the temperature here in the northeast dropped into the upper 
thirties last night....I went out to check the coolant level before starting
as usual and lo-and-behold it had dropped ten millimeters overnight.  No 
real big deal...then when I looked 'neath the westy there was a little 
puddle below those rear heater xtions I replaced in July.  Wouldn't you
know all those hose clamps were considerably looser than in July.  Now
I beleave we have added yet another step to the seasonal protocol for
all wasserboxer owners in the lands of seasonal temp changes.
