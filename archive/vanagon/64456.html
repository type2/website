Subject:      Re: Flopping mirrors - Vanagon

&gt;Take a hose clamp and tighten it around the base...

&gt; After that I drilled a hole all the way through the mounting bracket in
the
&gt; same axis as the original bolt.  Where the hole pops out the top of the
&gt; bracket, countersink a hole into the plastic and then use a stainless
bolt
&gt; and nut to hold the mirror as tight as you want.  No problem since then,


With all this talk about fixing those Vanagon mirrors, I suspect you may
not realize how inexpensive they are to simply replace.  Why mess with hose
clamps and such?  Remove the mirror, and CAREFULLY tighten the nut under
the mount.  One of three things will happen.

a)  The problem goes away.  You just saved twenty bucks.
b)  The problem goes away for a couple of months and then returns.  Order a
brand new German mirror for $19.95 plus postage.
c)  The bolt shears when you try to tighten it.  Be careful changing lanes
until your new mirror arrives.  :-)
