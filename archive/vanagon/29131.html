     I thought the question was:&quot;Which is the outside lane?&quot;, not, which is the 
     fast/slow lane.

&gt;So here's a Friday question:
&gt;Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?
     
i always was told/brainwashed that the lane next fartherest away from the 
median (the center strip of the multi-lane bi-directional highway) was the 
SLOWEST lane. the lane closest to the median was the FASTEST lane.
     
this was supposedly to allow for the best-of-all-possible-worlds where ALL 
exit ramps exited off the slow lanes (away from the median).
     
unfortunately, the american theory of high-speed highways has become very 
muddled in politics and money (&quot;There's never enough money or time to do it 
right the first time, but there's ALWAYS enough money and time to do it 
over!&quot;)
     
the lanes between the slow and fast lanes are medium-speed lanes for people 
who can't make up their minds.  :)
     
now ... you drive like that in Atlanta or Chicago, and you will be run over 
.. reminds me of Saigon traffic: two paved lanes of highway, five streams 
of traffic, seemingly all going in different directions!! and God help you 
in the traffic circles!!!!
