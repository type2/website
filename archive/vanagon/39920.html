Subject: wiring diagrams for '73 super beetle?
Date: Tue, 16 Apr 1996 18:03:50 -0500 (CDT)

   Okay, okay, I know it's not a bus, but it's close. The Haynes manual I've
got has totally crappy wiring diagrams -- there are almost no wire color
definitions. Does anyone know what manual has *good* wire diagrams? Or
better yet, can scan them and email it to me? Please respond directly to me,
as I'm only reading the list on the archives. Thanx.
