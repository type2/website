Subject: Re: Mexican vehicles



&gt;This relates to the discussions about importing vehicles, mostly buses
&gt;from Canada. I saw two brand new Mexican beetles today in Loxley, AL ( 10
&gt;miles east of Mobile.) The &quot;dealer&quot; said he got them approved for CA, so 
&gt;they should be good for everywhere. They had AL plates on both of them. 
&gt;If he can get beetles, how about buses? What's available in Mexico? 

This is the first I've heard of someone getting away with this.  I'd love 
to know how he did it.  As far as what's available in Mexico, they have a 
breadloaf-style bus with a water-cooled Rabbit type motor and a radiator up 
front. Kinda neat. Even more unusual is a bus made in Brazil, I think, that 
had a breadloaf-style big windshield but looked like an old 13-window 
Deluxe Microbus in the rear, complete with corner windows!  I'd love to be 
driving one of those around here!!
Anyway, I would definately check with the local DMV before buying one of 
these, and get a written guarantee that the bugs could be registered and
would pass safety and emissions inspection in AL.  (If they're registered 
as '97's, I don't see how they could meet '97 emissions standards, for 
example.)
