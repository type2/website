Subject: Re:  Westy Manualzzz

Michael Heron suggests:
&gt;Pat, Joe ( and all other Westy manual owners):
&gt;
&gt;why don't we pool our resources, and make copies of our manuals, and trade
&gt;with each other. In my humble (as compared to Joel's) data summarizing
&gt;skills I surmize the following manuals are currently owned by the following
&gt;subscribers
&gt;
&gt;Pat Walsh- 78' Westy manual
&gt;Joe Clark- 68'-72' Westy Manual
&gt;Michael Heron- 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)
&gt;
&gt;i like seeing Westy manuals from all years :):)
&gt;

Okay, making some additions and corrections, this is what I think we each
have so far:

Michael Heron     - 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)
Joe Clark         - 68'-72' Super-duper Westy Parts Manual
Pat Walsh         - 1970 Westy Manual (same manual used in '71?)
Dave Kautz        - 1974 Westy Manual
Sami Dakhlia      - 1975 Westy Manual

About my '70 manual being the one for '71:  Has anybody seen a &quot;real&quot; '71
manual?  I was told the '70 was used for '71.  Anyway, what do we want to
do with all these?  Personally, I wouldn't mind making a copy for anyone
who's interested but I'm only interested myself in the one for my year and
Joe's detailed parts manual.  Someone mentioned scanning, but mine's 17 pages
long and that seems kind of unwieldy:  too much disk space for all of them
on a server, too long to download, etc.  It's my suggestion we just stick to
&quot;old fashioned&quot; copies.  Maybe if we could get a list of who has what manual
for every year from, eg., '67-'79, we could put it in the FAQ?  That way
if people wanted a copy for their particular year they could just email the
appropriate person instead of one person being in charge of (and having to
deal with) all of it.  Just a suggestion.  What does everyone else think?
