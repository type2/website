Subject: Thanks.    (re: profiting on VW's, etc.)

Just wanted to thank the many listmembers who e-mailed me after that 
flame-fest over profiting on VW's.  Before I posted my response to the 
list, I was feeling very negative about the list and the vindictiveness of 
some of its members. Actually I took it very personally. Your kind words 
were well-timed.
Thanks,
Ron
