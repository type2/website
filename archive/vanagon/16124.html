I agree with Tim S on the rust check (and about Peugeots as well). We had
both the Renault  and the Westy sprayed by them for about 110 each. (plus
they give Club Z points). Once the holes are drilled you can diy every
year using the spray can method. The only down side is that the  oil
attracts dust so the Ivory colour of the Van has now become gray.. a
good reason to buy a dark colour I suppose....DC 

There are several key areas in the Wsty that should be sprayed - rocker
panels of course but also the rear engine compartment and high above in
the roof area where the oil can creep down with time.
