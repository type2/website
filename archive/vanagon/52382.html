bedtime. &gt;&gt;

You responded: &lt;&lt; How exactly do you accomplish this wonderful trick? &gt;&gt;

   Here it is:  With the seat in the bed mode, we're sitting on the middle
portion, feet up on the large mattress pad facing rearwards; then reach back to
pull the seat cushion up into place in order to serve as a backrest.  There
should be a click as it locks.  Our weight on the bottom cushion prevents it
from attempting to convert itself from a chaise back into a forward facing seat
as we lean back! &lt;G&gt;
