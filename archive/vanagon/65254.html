Subject:      low oil warning light/buzzer

My 86 Synchro runs well but has a small quirk.  About 10-30 seconds after a
cold start (at temperatures under about 60 F) the oil warning light/buzzer
come on for a block or two.  They then go off and are not heard from again.
 This happens about half the time, with no discernible pattern.
Occasionally while driving the oil light will come on for a few seconds
(without the buzzer) and then go off.   The oil level is full and oil and
filter are changed at 3-4000 miles with Valvoline 10-40.  Is this a
possible problem with an oil pump or just an electical gremlin?  Should I
have an oil pressure test done?  Any help will be appreciated.


p.s.  My Volvo-driving wife just mentioned on the subject of pet names for
vehicles, that if we had four Bugs, instead of just one, she would name
them John, Paul, George, and Ringo.  Has anyone out there done similarly?
