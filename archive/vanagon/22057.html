Subject: Printed Circuit Foil

     
     If you remember I posted about a week ago &quot;Instrument Illumination&quot;. 
     Thank you all for the help now I have another one. I replaced the bad 
     bulbs for the instruments but it still does not work. 
     
     I did find a small tear in the Circuit foil, a friend says that a 
     soldering iron would fix it and I called to get a quotes on a new one 
     ($110.00). Is this price fair??
     
     Can I get it straight from VW? If so who has the number?
     
     Thanks
     
     I have enjoyed the Westy so far
