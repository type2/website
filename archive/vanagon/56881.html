I don't know where you live, but I've lived most of my life in Minnesota --
school years in the coldest part of Northern Minnesota (Embarrass), and I've
never heard of this. I don't remember having a stuck parking brake, and I
always use it.  It's just too risky to leave to the gears.  It's very easy to
knock the shifter into neutral on your way out of the car.  It's much harder
to accidently release the parking brake. 

My kids would appreciate it if you get your parking brake working right so it
doesn't stick, and use it.

Since you felt free to espouse dangerous practices on this list, I'll feel
free to post a reasonable rebuttal back to the list.  Don't take it
personally, it's just the other side of the coin.

P.S. Please trim your quoted replies to the list, or you won't be posting to
the list anymore.
