Joel espewed:
&gt; 
&gt; 1988 GL
&gt; 75,000  miles
&gt; 4.  occassional valve lifter ticking when cold or parked overnight
&gt;     on incline.

I've experienced this while on a level surface occasionally.  Is this
a big concern?


&gt; 5.  air conditioning housing fell down and hit me in the head. :(
&gt;     repaired (self-done). later, vw had a dealer-service recall on
&gt;     this.

I got bonked by my AC only the bonk was to my wallet for $300 for a
resistor pack. :(

&gt; 6.  front brake pads wear out in about 15,000 miles. replaced
&gt;     must about every year. $70 per set from dealer.
&gt;     used one set of non-vw pads and they scarred up the rotors. had to
&gt;     get rotors turned and resurfaced.

Really?  I have 55K on my '91 and have not replaced the pads yet.  You
must do more drag racing in yours than I do.  ;)

&gt; 7.  * melted wiring harness around engine/fuel injectors: air cleaner
&gt;     box had pinched one of the injector wires and shorted the mess to
&gt;     ground (chassis). $1200 to repair (non-dealer). cable-tied the
&gt;     wires out of the way next time! &lt;note: 91 model came from factory
&gt;     with cable-ties on those wires!!&gt;
&gt;     i now have an 88 bus with an 87 brain, idle stabilizer, relays,
&gt;     wiring harnes, etc.

You sure are unlucky Joel....


&gt; 8.  replaced oxygen sensor at 50,000 miles (paranoia)

I'll do mine at 60K per the manual unless it has problems before.

&gt; 9.  replaced distributor cap and rotor every 25,000 miles (burned
&gt;     rather badly. might not 'need' replacing, but i do it anyway)
&gt; 10. * replaced coolant temp sensor twice. seems like every 25,000 miles.
&gt; 11. replaced fuel filter every 25,000 miles (paranoia)
&gt; 12. replaced coolant temp sensor (for dash gauge) once. gauge just
&gt;     quite working.
&gt; 13. replaced coolant expansion tank (not overflow/fill tank), coolant
&gt;     level sensor, cap, and gasket at 40,000 miles.
&gt; 14. replaced transmission fluid, coolant, power steering fluid, and
&gt;     brake fluid every two years. am overdue for the next 'enema'.
&gt; 15. * replaced ALL fuel hoses at about five years (after two leaks in
&gt;     one month).
&gt; 


I do the rest at the required interval except I haven't changed the coolant
or the fuel filter yet.  Fingers crossed.

Steven
