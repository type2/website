Bill, I had a similar problem, though my DPO painted with household latex
paint. I have a compressor and air sander and chose to spend about 6 hours
sanding. I still have a few small spots where I'll have to sand by hand
and I also had to use the sandblaster on a couple of spots (e.g. the vent
plate for the sink).  I think if I were to do this over, I might opt to
rough up the paint some and then put on a coat of durable, rubberized
paint, which I would get from a marine supply store--I still may end up
doing this &quot;one of these days.&quot; I suspect that looks much better. Clara
used that kind of paint on a top 8 or 10 months ago (I think) and last
report was that it still looked good. Don't know if she had other paint
underneath it though. 

Good luck! Joe
