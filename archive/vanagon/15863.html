Subject: Re: The Berg and springs

&gt;I am planning on buying a stock motor with a new case and installing
&gt;009, extractor w/single QP and dual Kadrons.  Now, Berg is telling me
&gt;that dual carbs means dual springs.  He quotes some stats about valve
&gt;train failure and such.  He also warns that most builders do not
&gt;correctly install and shim dual springs, which can cause a whole other
&gt;set of problems.  My question is this:  do I order my engine with
&gt;dual springs or go without?  He doesn't say how often others screw
&gt;this up.  It would seem from his writing that stock single springs
&gt;would give me more trouble than risking having someone screw up
&gt;installing dual springs.  Opinions?  Oh, this would be a stock
&gt;1600DP going into a '71 bus.  Thanks, Jim

IMHO, Dual carbs have little to do with dual valve springs. My 65
Notchback came from the factory with dual Solexes and single valve
springs. The issue that Mr. Berg is worried about is the ability to
over-rev and &quot;float&quot; single springs when you install dual carbs.
&quot;Floating&quot; refers to a condition in which a engine is turning such
high RPM that the spring tension provided by a single spring is unable
to completely close and seat the valves in the head. Keep the revs
reasonable (under 5000 rpm) and you should never experience
&quot;floating&quot;.

I did once float the valves on my 66 Bug with single springs. I had a
2-bbl carb, headers and 009 Dist. It was during the slalom race at one
of the Bug-Outs in Manassas. I was revving at over 6500 rpm when it
happened. The engine more or less acted like it was shut down, then
suddenly came back to life at about 3000 rpm. No damage was done.
