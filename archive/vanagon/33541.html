Subject: Heater Cables

Anybody know of a permanent fix for heater cable problems on a '83 Westfalia. 
The valve is stuck open from kinked cable which is fine in the winter but need
a fix by suymmer and this will be the second one to be replaced.  Do they only
last a couple years or is there a better fix?

None of the shops in my area are very anxous to replace the cable for fear of
it happening again.

                                                                           -
Craig
