&gt;I drive a 1986 Syncro Westfalia, use 91 to 93 octane gasoline, drive 100

&gt;My consumption is 14.5 litres/100km = 19 mi/imp gal = 16 mi/US gal.
&gt;
&gt;According to a report from S.Africa, 14.5 l/100km is normal at 100
&gt;km/hr. Any other Syncro drivers have better/worse results?
I've averaged 18.11 mpg over the last year in my 87 syncro Westy.
