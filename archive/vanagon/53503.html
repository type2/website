&gt; Does anyone have any experience carrying a canoe on a Wesfalia camper?  Is
it
&gt; best to use the foam pads that fit on the sides of the canoe and rest
these
&gt; directly on the fiberglass top, or is it better to use a rack?  Anybody
&gt; recommend a particular rack and how to mount it?  Thanks in advance.

Go with the foam pads.  You don't have to drill holes in your top.  You
don't have to buy a rack that could be stolen.  The foam pads are extremely
inexpensive and it won't matter (much) if you lose them.  

Just be sure to securely tie the front and back of the canoe to the bumpers
of your van. Stop and retighten the rope 20 minutes or so into the trip.  If
you know knots...try using a bowline in the rope.  Loop the rope around the
bumper then back through the bowline and cinch it down tight.  Secure the
cinch with two half hitches.  That's the easiest way to readjust the ropes
without the ropes binding into the knots.

good luck,

Mark
