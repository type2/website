I guess, the quad round headlights of that Vanagon are same as the
quad round headlights of the Golf/Jetta 2, if this is available in
the US. All you need is that grille with four holes and maybe the
frames for the headlights. Similar grille is available on the German
aftermarket but you also may send a mail to VW SA, they are very
friendly but it needs some time to get the answer. The regular
dual round headlight grilles costs DM 100.- at German VAG dealers.

You have quad rectangular headlights, are two of each closed together
or do you have four individual holes in your grille?

On another thread the following web address was given to look at
Vanagons.

http://www.vw.co.za/history/frame.htm

On this page I selected the 1990's link and there at 1991 is a picture
of a vanagon that has quad round headlights.  I have  four rectangular
headlights on my '87 Westy.  Is a conversion to quad round headlights
available?  I have only seen dual round headlights.
