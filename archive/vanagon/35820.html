Subject: ccc's - cancel this weekend


I hate being the one to announce thse things, but it looks like my
recommendation for this weekend is going to be to cancel.  :(

Reasons are as follows:

people dropping out from schedule conflicts
people dropping out from concern over weather
people not having chains
medical conflicts
being over tired
having camped to much recently anyway
people have lost net access temporarily
people are snowed in
people don't like bumpy roads
people don't want to go so far away
no one can agree on where they wanna go
yada, yada

So, whaddya say, volx - shall we shelve this and try for another time?
