If all you're talking about is rounded corners on the hex head which is 
preventing the wrench from gripping the head properly, then drilling this 
out is your LAST resort.  Get a small cold chisel and turn out the bolt 
with that.  Start by gently tapping the chisel point into the top of the 
bolt, next to one of the hex flats.  After you have a nice &quot;bite&quot;, and 
while still tapping gently on the chisel, start sloping the end of the 
chisel such that the force of your blows is transmitted to the head in a 
counterclockwise direction.  This should turn it right out!
