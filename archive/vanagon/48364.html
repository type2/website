Subject: followup, was: leaking vanagon

Greetings,
        After reporting that my Vanagon leaked from under the dash during
rainstorms, I recieved several responses, most of which suggested a failed
windshield seal.
        Based on the recommendations of a few listees, I layed a bead of
clear caulk (my wife and I are painting the house so it didn't even require
a trip to the store) under the windsheild seal all the way around. 
        I am pleased to report that after two prolonged torrential downpours
and one high pressure wash, my van is dry as a bone!
        Thanks to all who responded.

Pat
