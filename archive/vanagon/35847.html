&gt; expensive?!!!  What if my tires are good?  Thanks

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; It seems as if my &quot;radhaus&quot; steering wheel &quot;wobbles&quot; when I drive at slow
&gt; speeds, ie 5-10 mph.  I know I'm not giving much to go on, but if you
&gt; could give your 2 cents I would like to read.

&gt; .-  Lets not forget the biscut in the steering shaft, at the floor level, 
if this is weak or failing one will get exessive play in the wheel!
  Just a thought ,I drove one like this and it was very scary.
