I have a friend that is looking into a '84 Weekender with automatic
transmission and A/C.  It has 143,000 miles on the original engine.
My friend has yet to see it but it is described as being in good
shape body/interior wise.  The guy is asking $3800.

Does that sound like a ball park figure?

What sort of mileage can one expect to get from a wasserboxer engine?


I have a '84 Vanagon with 97,000 miles that I paid $2300 for.  It still
runs real strong and I felt like I paid on the low side for the shape that
it was in.
