Hi Louise,

ARI stands for Traffic Information System, every Radio station has it
and when they send some traffic jam Information, there is a short
signal, may be for one sec., piiiieeep, and your Radio turns louder or
stop playing CD / tape. So you dont miss it.... And this button is for
ON/OFF.

PCI Yes I Know the name, but the function ? I think its an tool that
scan the FM Band for good (powerfull) stations ????
