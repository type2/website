Brother Cheese wrote the following calumny:  

&gt;If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the

For which reason I am compelled to defend our honor by contradicting
him: ;)

&gt;The bus has little loops welded to the front of the frame intended for
&gt;towing use.

Those aren't designed for towing use. They're designed for
holding the vehicle down when it's on a car carrier being delivered to the
dealer.  They're pretty weak.  In truth, I tow with them, too, but if you
do it you ought to be good at it. If you go jerking on those little wire
loops, there's no reason they shouldn't fail. It is very unwise to
underestimate the velocity at which a loose tow hook can travel--they can
punch through sheet metal and easily through windshields. The tow-er
needn't fear for his life but the tow-ee might consider whether it's best
to persuade the generous tow-er to use his bumper.
