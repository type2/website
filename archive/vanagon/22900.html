Subject: westy table

          i found a westy table in very good shape at a local
          unauthorized vw repair shop (luvwrs?).  amazingly it has
          survived in spite of windows being gone from this bus.  the
          shop owner wants to sell but doesn't know how to price.  i
          told about this list and he actually suggested i inquire as
          to it's value with y'all and bring him a reasonable dollar
          amount.  i got him to take it inside out of the elements and
          it awaits.  so, anyone got any ideas as to value?  i'm lost
          but want the darn thing.  thanks   ray  gainesville, fl
          oh yeah, it's the big table that folds up on the driver's
          side about midway back.
