&gt; 
&gt; Bad news folks... well not for any of you.
&gt; 
&gt; On the way to night school last night, In the school driveway,
&gt; I smashed the van...

As one who has been through a swapped engine and now a top-end
overhaul, you  have my sympathy. When you get more relaxed,
I think we  would all be interested in how bad the damage is.

We are here to help if you need anything...
