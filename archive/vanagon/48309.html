There's also a pretty good blues festival that happens just blocks away
over Labor Day weekend.  Music outdoors is hard to beat...

&gt;
&gt;Busses by the Arch is a fantastic, friendly camping event held twice
&gt;a year near St. Louis MO. The next one is over the Labor Day
&gt;Weekend, August 30-Sept 1. Bill Bowman, who organizes BBTA, asked me to
&gt;post some information, details and directions to the campground, so I
&gt;put some stuff up on my home VW page,
&gt;http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm with links to more.
&gt;
&gt;We attended this last year, and it was great, the central US location
&gt;really makes it possible for anyone who is bus crazy to attend. Last
&gt;year's &quot;Greatest Distance&quot; vehicle came from Oregon. While I have
&gt;no interest, I strongly encourage everyone to go for it!  It is
&gt;sponsored by both LIMBO and NEATO, so you can expect to see everything
&gt;from splitties to Eurovans. All VWs are welcome, BTW, even non Buses.
