I think that this would more correctly called RE-tuned.  For an application
in a truck or a van with much more weight to carry arround engines are
typically setup for much more torque than peak power, and peak at a much
lower RPM.  I would bet that the 140HP peak is about 1500 to 2000 RPM lower
than in the cars - which is a GOOD thing for a van.  Also, I bet that its
torque rating is even higher than in the cars.
