Well, since I hate to belabor the obvious, I've kept my peace on 
this one, but then it occurred to me that may some of you don't
_know_ about it:

2 major VW events this weekend:  

Saturday, there's the Bus Farmers(NEATO?) Swap Meet (there's prolly a 
&quot;real&quot; name for it, but I don't know what it is...)

Its in Sacramento, under the W-X freeway, cross of 21st, I believe.
A must-see to believe event!

Sunday, there's Bug O Rama, out at Sacramento Raceway.

Oh, and also Saturday, there's the SOTO &quot;picnic,&quot; hosted by the
Phantom himself, Dave Heard.

Personally, I'm heading to the swap meet first thing, and MAYBE if I
get bored there, tootle on over to the the picnic.
