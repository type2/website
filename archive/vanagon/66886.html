Subject:      more about a little green golf

For those that responded... Yes, it was a syncro.

It was located in up near Lake Tahoe in California and I believe it had
California plates (though I wasn't thinking that it might be registered
somewhere else as it was on the little road up to Sugar Bowl and I didn't
think too many people would be in that area if there were coming down from
say Canada)...

I don't know the owner or where it came from, I felt a little weird about
walking up someone's drive way to gawk at their lovely little car... It
either had a new paint job or was new as the paint was one of those colors
that VW didn't start til recently...

I'll walk up the driveway next time and leave a note on the windshield ;)

My SO wants one now ;)

I want one too...
