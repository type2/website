&gt;'82 VW LT45TD, 4wd camper, 6 cyl Vovlo turbo diesel,
&gt;low miles, many spares, $30,000
&gt;Anybody know about this?  Looks like Vanagons big
&gt;brother, with a raised fiberglass roof, lenthened rear
&gt;end, but what might be standard vanagon nose (hard to
&gt;say comparing teeny picture to the '81)  certainly seems
&gt;to have Vanagon grill, lights, and VW emblem.  $30k

nah. the LT series is a larger, front-engine, rear-wheel drive van built
by VW and M.A.N. of Austra, a large truck company (rivals of Mercedes and
Saab-Scania and Volvo trucks). it LOOKS sorta like a vanagon, but not when
you see them together. the 45 series is a BIG truck. i'd say on the order
of the size of a medium step-side or the UPS truck that delivers around
town. :)

i find that &quot;4wd&quot; a little hard to believe, however. but then, i guess if
want to pay for it... on a 45, the rear axle has dual-wheels on each side.

&gt;conspicuously customized.  Has anyone seen this done to a Vanagon based
&gt;vehicle?  The US manufactured vans tricked out this way aren't that

there was a Dutch company named Klemper or something like that, who used
to do that with the breadloaf buses. they may have continued the practice
with the vanagons. what they appeared to do was take a single cab pickup
and cut the bed off, extend it, and weld a box onto the bed. for a REALLY
big bread truck. one of the british bus books has a picture of one.
looks like a really comfortable camper, but loooooooooooong. :)
