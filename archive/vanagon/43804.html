&gt;I'm planning on replacing the exhaust system on my '78 Westy with a
&gt;one-piece unit that I bought from JC Whitney.  Right now, all I've got
&gt;is the new muffler, which replaces everything rear of the heat exchangers.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the question - Do I need to get some gasket material for where
&gt;the new exhaust bolts on?  If so, can I just pick up some gasket material
&gt;at my FLAPS and cut to fit?  Should I use some Permatex stuff?  I'd like
&gt;to do it this weekend if I can find some info; the bus is really loud,
&gt;and I'll have some time this weekend...
&gt;
Don't know exactly how the exhaust is set up on a Type IV, but if it's
similar to a Type I, there's an asbestos (? or similar) donut that goes
between the muffler and heat exchanger, and an asbestos and metal gasket that
goes between the muffler and head.  I don't think I'd try to make either one
from gasket material.  That's okay for &quot;ordinary&quot; gaskets, but these have
to withstand enormous amounts of heat which is why they're constructed as
they are.  But I'm pretty sure a Foriegn FLAPS, independent VW repair shop
or even the (shudder) dealer should have the parts on hand at a reasonable
price.  Neither the gasket nor the donut needs Permatex.
