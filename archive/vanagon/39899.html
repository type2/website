&gt;&gt;misshifts....to the point where Erik (my 16 yr old) and I were about to
&gt;&gt;throw in the towel as far as standards were concerned...
&gt;&gt;So I figured, what the hell, lets take the EV out.
&gt;&gt;

I had a very similar experience learning to drive.  First time behind
a wheel was a friend's mom's Subaru--and every start saw smoking tires
and flying gravel.  My friend flagged me after just a few attempts.

After I got my permit [ :-) :-) ], my dad taught me to drive his 79
bus.  Never a problem!
