Subject: How to turn over Air Cool Engine
Date: 02 Dec 96 08:43:23 PST

Use a big long multipurpose screwprybendriver placed between
the vanes on the alternator fan.  Works great on my '80.  Place 
object straight down far enough to rest against the hub.  If it 
doesn't work, the belt may not be tight enough.

&gt; How do those with air-cooled Vanagons turn the motor over manually?
