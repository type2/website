&gt;20-25 psi?  ack!  15-20 psi?  AACK!  I hope you are not running with that
&gt;kind of pressure under load on the freeway.  Maybe you are talking about
&gt;warm idle pressure, yeah, that's it.  

WARM --OR RATHER HOT--, YES. IDLE, NO. TALKING ABOUT STEADY STATE EQUILIBRIUM
AFTER AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR AT 60 MPH+. 

&gt;I'm trying to reassure myself here.

NOW I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

&gt;I get nervous if I have less than 35 psi on the freeway, and I feel all
&gt;warm and fuzzy inside if that needle stays above 40.  When it drops to 30
&gt;I stop and have a bite to eat :)  Am I a fanatic about oil pressure?  I
&gt;don't think so, but if I am, hey, someone let me know and I will shut up.

WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?

&gt;In the meantime, my oil-related mods are as follows:  VDO pressure and temp
&gt;gauges,

MY PRESSURE GAUGE IS A CHEAP NO-NAME BRAND AND I DO HAVE
SOME DOUBTS
ABOUT ITS CALIBRATION/ACCURACY. MY POINT, HOWEVER, IS THAT SYNTHETIC
OIL APPEARS TO HAVE A RATHER STABLE VISCOCITY. ON A COLD ENGINE, BOTH
OILS GIVE ABOUT THE SAME READING, BUT ONCE WARMED UP, SYNTEC DOESN'T
DROP AS LOW AS, SAY, 10w-40. tHIS IS NOT A CONTROLLED, SCIENTIFIC
EXPERIMENT, THOUGH.

&gt;Melling high-volume pump, air flaps removed, long gentle warmups.
&gt;The air flaps in the fan housing in the type IV motor, when open, force the
&gt;cooling air to do a 180 in order to get to the oil cooler.  I have harped
&gt;on this before.

INTERESTING. I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO REMOVE MINE, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE
WINTERS _DO_ GET QUITE COLD HERE. DO YOU LIVE IN A NICER CLIMATE?  

&gt;Whatever type of oil you use, please don't let it get too 
&gt;hot or dirty!
HEAT SEEMS UNAVOIDABLE, THAT WHY I USE AN OIL THAT'S LIKELY TO WITHSTAND
IT BETTER. &gt;
