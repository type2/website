Bo did say:

&gt;I resemble that remark.  My other car is a Mercedes 300D (black by the way) 
&gt;and I got a smoking car letter from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation 
&gt;Commission.  Oh, well... I like the smell of diesel smoke in the morning!

What year's your 300D?  Is it M-B's equivalent of VW's direct injection?
It would seem that even recent vintage M-B diesels, properly tuned, emit
less visual and odious signs of being a diesel.  They still clatter like
a diesel, however.

A properly tuned TDI motor should not smoke and is very clean, emissions-
wise.  It's real appeal (to me, anyway) is that it has diesel mileage 
coupled with gas engine performance (i.e. doesn't have a 0-60 of 20 secs.
or whatever it is).

I just got back from HI, and heck, you could probably run a car on coal
and they probably wouldn't care.  I guess they just figure the trade winds
take all the smog off to LA, or somewhere...  ;)
