&gt;Dear Sir,
&gt;I was wondering if you could answer a question I have about my newly
purchased 73 &gt;westphalia. On long trips in my bus I discovered that the floor
gets quite hot between &gt;the ice box and the seat behind the drivers seat. I
was hoping that you might beable to &gt;tell me what is the cause of this heat
and if it is abnormal? Thanks for your time.

Hans,
In a '73 westfalia there is a small heat vent on the floor between the
ice box and the jump seat behind the driver.  Warm air flows from this
vent when the heat lever on the dash directs heat to the floor.

It sounds like your duct is clogged up and not dispersing the heated air.
There's a few things you might try...

Remove the throw rug from the walkthrough aisle. (good)

Always set the heat lever on the dash to the 'defrost' position. (better)

Crawl under the bus and disconnect the warm air duct.  Remove the leaves,
candy wrappers, and whatever else is plugging it up.  Put it securely back
into position. (best)
