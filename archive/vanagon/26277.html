Subject: Weekend Trip

I just got back from another camping trip.  This one was out in 
winchester Va.  The bus performed beautifully, except that one of my rear 
tires came apart.  Changed it and was on my way again.  saw an 
interesting vehicle.  A ford (i think) van with a late (74 and after) pop-top
stuck on it.  Everything was original including the canvas.  I didn't get 
to see the inside, but I assume they had set up a bed of some sort.  I 
was kind of weird to see.  Next weekend I'm off to the bug-on in monrovia 
md.  Should be fun.
