Subject: Towing a bus
Date: Mon, 3 Jul 1995 21:50:47 -0700 (PDT)

Hi,
	Having just bought Jeff Schneiter's bus, I am faced with the problem
of getting a bus with no engine from thr Bay area to San Diego (about
500 miles).  Unless I can send it UPS :)  I think the only option is to
tow it.  The problem is how.

	I found out that I can rent a trailer from U-haul for $50/day.  This
is the kind that the whole bus would sit on (but it has no winch - how
do you get a non-mobile automobile up on it??).  Great, but what do I
tow it with?

	I have a Mustang with more than enough power to pull the bus, but
it only weighs 3000 lbs, and towing a 3,000+ lb van behind it might not
be good for stability.  It might not even be legal.  Then there is the
fact that the Mustang is a unibody, and it might take some doing (and a
lot of money) to get a hitch attached to it that will handle the load
and not twist the body.  Plus, the Mustang is a weekend drag racer, and
putting a 30lb trailer hitch on it is not good for 1/4 mile times.

	So, that leaves the bus.  I know, it only has ~65 horsepower, but it
weighs 4,000 lbs and has a good strong frame to mount a hitch to.  And
I don't care about a hitch being welded to it.  And it would be kinda
cool to see a VW bus towing another VW bus, no?  And I could take the
coastal route to avoid the 4100 ft &quot;Grapevine&quot; hill.  I want to do it.
A class II hitch (3,500 lbs/300 lbs tongue weight) should do fine,
methinks.  Am I insane?  I wouldn't be in a hurry, and I don't care
about going fast.  Am I crazy?  Nuts?  Please tell me I'm not...

-David
