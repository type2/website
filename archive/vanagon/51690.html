Subject: Rear Hatch Struts

HATCH STRUTS:  Just got a pair from Volks Cafe for $50.  I was told that
there are two strengths available and one side should have higher strength
than the other.  Peter recommended buying two heavy weight ones - I did and
I can just about do chin ups on the hatch.  So far so good!  And good
price.

Ask Kyle on the list to mail them to you.
Don.
