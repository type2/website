I was watching Real TV on Fox not too long ago and saw a Vanagon been   
chased by a police car.  It was dark blue and the poor thing had the   
tires blown out by a device the police put on the road to stop him.   
 Though it was cool that the Vanagon's practicality had extended into the   
world of crime. Cool!
