Subject: A possible purchase

All,
I am wanting an opinion from the collective. In todays Austin Chronicle
there is advertised a 1979 VW Camper. Ad description follows:
1979 VW Camper van run good, needs clutch,oil cooler, inspected,
registred. $1000 OBO.

I have yet to see this vehicle, what I am wanting to know is, is this a
fair price for a '79 Camper that requires a new clutch &amp; oil cooler.
Like I said I haven't seen the vehicle, but I need to know what a good
starting point for the best offer would be.  If the $1000 is fair then
fine, but if it is high, where should I start?

What can I &quot;take off&quot; the price for the various &quot;problems&quot; encountered
by Campers of this age.  Are there any special things I need to look for
before I go look?  Was rust in any particular abnormal areas a problem
for this year?

I'm asking because when I go to look, I will look for rust around the
windows, underneath the cargo area, around the wheel wells, around the
doors(all of them). Any where I've forgotten?

Feel free to mail me directly. If there is a demand for the info, I will
post a condensed version of what I learn from you all.

Thanks in advance,

David
