Subject: Re: trip odometer

&gt;this talk of a non-operating odometer reminds me of a warning:
&gt;
&gt;DO NOT reset the trim odometer while the car is moving.
&gt;
&gt;this is true of all vw's, volvo's, bmw's and other cars with vdo speedometers
&gt;.. this is a really quick way to break that little gear inside there. this
&gt;came about from my sister's volvo years ago ... after the service dept.
&gt;replaced the speedo, they told her about this. :)  and it seems to have fit
&gt;all the broken odometers that i've run into.
&gt;
&gt;of course, if your speedometer doesn't have a trip odometer, this does not
&gt;apply. :)

I'm sure that this is what has been done to this VW.  It is actually the
trip odometer that is (proximally, at least) getting stuck - it gets stuck
on 9/10 readings.  Do you think we can fix this if the little white gear
has been broken this way?  Or should we resign ourselves to getting a new
(or used/salvaged) odometer?  We have lots of super glue - what breaks?
