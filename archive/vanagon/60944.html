Subject: Undercoating Removal Tech Aid
Date: 05 Jun 97 08:39:57 PDT

I just finished installing the fuel pump from my spare '80 Westi into 
my daily driver.  The one I pulled out was starting to make whining 
noises, but still worked, so it goes into the spare parts pile.

The vehicle had been undercoated at one time in it's history.  I used 
my usual solvent to clean it prior to storage, rubbing alcohol.  The 
alcohol actually dissolved the undercoating.

Obvoiusly scrape off the big stuff, but alcohol may do a nice final 
cleaning.

BIG WARNING - This stuff IS flammable, so use due caution.

Different solvents work on different substances.

Happy cleaning.
