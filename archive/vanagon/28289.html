Do you have a 27LT8.5-14 tire as your spare?  I find that even a 
205-70R14 doesn't fit very well in the spare tire area.  I could barely 
get one in the '80 Vanagon I had, and Kelley McDaniel could barely get 
the one that I gave him in his '82.

And speaking of Kelley... he's the one driving from Kansas to Washington 
(I think those are the right places) in an '82 Vanagon with an engine 
from a 411.  He stopped by Sunday night and picked up a fuel tank and a 
spare tire.  He had a blow out along the way, so was in need of another 
spare.
