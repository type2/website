Subject:      aux battery ideas

i've been doing a little reading of &quot;Home Power&quot; magazine lately and I'm
wondering about the design of a solar system to recharge the batteries.
any one with experience in this area? My main concern is the interaction
with the dual-battery solenoid and the existing charger - it would be nice
to have the whole system wired together to get electrons from solar and/or
alternator.


another thing i was noting was the use of some sophisticated metering
equipment to monitor actual amp-hours available in a battery and its true
voltage.
one brand is called &quot;E-meter&quot; from a seattle company named &quot;Cruising
Equipment&quot; which I presume reflects  its maritime origins. Anyone familiar
with the use of these? It may be overkill at approx US$200 but it may give
you that accuracy that the LEDs lack!
