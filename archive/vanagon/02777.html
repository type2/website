Subject: Eurobago

Saw one today at the &quot;downtown&quot; VW dealer in Houston, Mahan VW.

White, w/gray interior, and from the left it looked like a partial panel
van (which it is).  Stickers were somewhat confusing.  It has one from VW
and one from Winnebago.  VW's is for a basic Panel Eurovan at $21k+US and
the one from Winnebago is for $9k+US for a total of $31k+US.

Features:
Pop-top (didn't see it extended, but it's as thick as the old Westfalia's,
not thin like the Multi-Eurovan pop-up)
Two burner stove
Fridge
Driver and passenger captain's chairs (swivel)
Two rear seats (much like in the Vanagon Westfalia)
Mount points for a removable two-body center seat
Five speed
12,000 btu propane fueled furnace (two ports between the rear seat and the
left side cabinetry.
I didn't check out the &quot;bedness&quot; of it - the salesman waddled out soon
after I (surprise!) just opened it up on the &quot;lot&quot;.

The cabinet work looked solid enough...

But $31k?  I'd buy a used monster motor home for that much, with far more
comfort and far less gas mileage (16/18 EPA on the sticker). Let's hope,
for VWoA's sake that lots of people see more utility in it than I do...
