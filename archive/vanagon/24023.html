Subject: RE: 55mph/right-ln ethics/was speedo repair

Steve Maher and others were discussing the &quot;innaccurate&quot; speedo from Tom
FFFFFs post:

&quot;But you have to wonder if this guy was as clueless as he sounds, or was he
indulging in a little bit of pompous righteousness, trying to force other to
declare how 'right' he was... (by doing the speed limit vs keeping up with
traffic).&quot;

I had to ride home from California to Phoenix with a fellow and his family
who for ethical reasonings drove 55.000000 MPH &quot;because it was the law.&quot;
Yeah cool but 100's of miles from anywhere, literally on I-5 and I-10, I
woulda figgered he'd do like 58-62? No, 55 was &quot;the law.&quot; Cool for ethics
and sh** but I wanted to get home. So did the millions of people that
screamed by us! No time for potty breaks either!!! eek! He ate sunflower
seeds one by one loudly cracking each seed with his teeth and smacked his
lips in between. I was about to kill him over the ethics thing and call it
self defense. Now I know where those hitch hikers that appear in the middle
of nowhere come from. I was about to jump out of the window! Right lane?
Cool, but keep up with traffic or park it!
BTW:Arizona Revised Statutes specifies that the right lane is for entering
or exiting the thoroughfare, Middle lane is for getting there, and the far
left lane is for passing only. This is observed by exactly no one in
Phoenix. Traffic is like a million MPH 1/2 car length off each others
bumpers. The &quot;Phoenix turn signal&quot; is a local expression for a quick glance
over your shoulder as you punch the throttle. Running yellow lights is a
virtual sport.
