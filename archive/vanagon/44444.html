Subject: i return, and the questions begion once more..



after the 24hr server move turned into a nice weeklong fiasco, i return, 
ad find that all the mail just piled upo, as i hoped..now to read threw 
it all..only 762 messages..i've had over 1000 before...anyway....

i got bored, and dropped the motor in the bus..according to St. John, it 
takes 2 people..it took this one person 47 minutes and 33 seconds. had to 
use crowbar to pry the buss over the enigne though..after romoving the 
carb, manifold, dizzy, and that &quot;thing&quot; ont he enigne..&lt;not to be 
confused with the type 181&gt; anyway....removed the tin, with all the 
screws nicely seized..how fun!, and the fan housing, and the whole 
heaterbox muffler contracption..&lt;i know...remove before hand and the 
einge is easier..anyhow, i didnt have the boards to put jack under and 
still get the wrench up there...

snapped off the top of 2 exhaust studs...twisted rright off..

and, on cylidners 3 and 2, err..the heads, where the cyl. and head meet, 
on that last fin, same place, both sides of eninge&lt;left and roght that 
is..&gt; is a crack.,.or a split..is this suppossed to be there?

and the sticky &lt;maybe&gt;valve..what would i do about it if it was? 

and how to detect a cracked head? &lt;i DONT want to pull this thing apart 
unless i haveto....right now i have my bug to worry about..right lower 
ball joint popped free..:(


anyway..thanks...
