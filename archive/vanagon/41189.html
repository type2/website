Subject: 	Conversion to Dual Carbs.....Maybe

Vanagonauts,

I've considered this move for some time, but still undecided on course of
action.   The present set up is the single 2bbl Weber progressive on 1800
pancake in 74 Westy.   Due to the Weber's cool weather behavior, I'm
considering a conversion to dual carbs.  After searching the archives, I've 
still not come up with definitive answers on a choice for this engine.  If
anyone who is running dual carbs on this type of engine could give me some
guidance, it would be greatly appreciated.

TIA
