Alright sage types!
The dirty deed must be done, and I need the wisdom of those who have bravely
gone there before me. The patient is a 78 Westy who is exhibiting a slight
list to the drivers side. The van is lower at the rear, with it being just
a tad lower on the rear drivers side. I shall be performing surgery within
the next week or so, and would muchly appreciate the home-mechanics-cut to
the chase-surefire easy way of doing this. I've read the manuals and have a
good idea of the procedure. I wanna know if it's as basic as it looks.

Murphy is telling me that those bolts on the spring plate covers are NOT
gonna go in those holes as easy as they come out. He also says that those
spring plates are not gonna compress easily, and line up with the bolt holes.

Regards,
Courtney
