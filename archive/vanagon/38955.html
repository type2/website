&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Do any of you have or know of a decent set of used pistons for sale?  I'm
&gt;looking some for my 85 vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, David

I can get you brand new P/L liners sets. Pistons are matched to the
cylinders.  Must buy both to work properly.  VW sells each P/L separately for
too much money.  I think a Brazilian set wil cost abotu 350 for all four.
 Let me know if you want me to follow up.
Dennis.
