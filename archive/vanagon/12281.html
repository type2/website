Subject: spider chains


Sami et al - I think those are called spiker chains if I remember
correctly, although it's been awhile.  You're right on the price.  I
once saw them in a Chrysler dealership for a mini-van, where they
are the only possibility, since there is so little clearance 
on that car between the tire and the inside wheel-well, and I don't
think regular or even cable chains would fit.  The dealership
name was/is:  Smith-Chrylser Plymouth in Richmond, CA.
