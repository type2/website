&gt;The interior of my 79 smells like gasoline fumes.  It is a daily driver,
&gt;and I noticed it about 3 days ago.

I had the same thing on my '72 Westfalia.  It was a rubber elbow on top of
the fuel tank that had dry rotted and split.  Every time I filled up I lost
gas.  Replaced it, no more problem!
