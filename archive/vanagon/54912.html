I tried the Bosch's and returned them, couldn't get them to fit good. 
Instead, I purchased Pylon Refills from Walmart and they have worked
good enough for me (and it rains quite a bit down here in Louisiana!). 
They slid on easy.  I don't use the rain-x stuff either.  The wipers
don't smear or chatter.
