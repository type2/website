Subject: Stainless Gasket?

Sorry for the ignorant questions, but y'all seem to be the experts.  This
weekend I talked with 2 friends who are mechanics and got conflicting
stories.  Is there a stainless steel plate (gasket?) for vanagon heads that
spans the head and retains the valve seats, to avoid dropped seats tearing
up the engine?  One friend says he has installed this before.  The other,
who is more VW knowledgeable says the only stainless he is aware of is the
spacer at the top of the cylinder, which he says he leaves out for better
compression.  Can you guys steer me on this?

My newly rebuilt 81 Westy is running 400 - 500 degrees f. head temp.  Will
this go down as the engine wears in, or is it a symptom of trouble.  The
oil temp runs 200 - 240 without the aux. oil cooler.  Appreciate any
advice.  David, thanks for the previous reply.
