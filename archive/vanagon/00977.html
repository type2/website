The EuroVan has two levers and three knobs. The main heater control
is directly from the Golf/Jetta //. One lever for heat control, the other
for the appropriate AC or fresh air direction, and the knob for the 
fan control.

Oops...let me change the knob count....5 knobs. There are two other
temp controls. One for the A/C in the rear compartment consisting of
a temp knob and a fan knob. The other for fresh air with temp and fan.
