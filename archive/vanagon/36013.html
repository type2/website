Subject: List stickers are already in P.R.

Hi folks! Two days ago I came from campus and I saw the postman depositing a
letter in my mailbox. Nice surprise, inside were the list stickers that I
proudly now display at the left lower corner of the Westy's windshield. I
think that I'm probably the only one in the island that got the stickers.
Good job Richard! God bless you
Saludos,
