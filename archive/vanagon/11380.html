Subject: Re: Ecu &amp; Idle Stabilizer

&gt;emissions, have replace just about everything else, and recently smoked the
&gt;cat.)  I get the feeling they don't really want to spend the time to &quot;check&quot;
&gt;these parts, since it seems they are more into part &quot;swapping&quot;. 

Their 'diagnostic procedure' IS to swap parts in and out. One part at a 
time!  Logic is not applied to the procedure! If two or more parts are off, 
this doesn't work at all. I had the idle problem with my '85, the dealer had 
it for 27 days total over a 6 month period and didn't fix it, under 
warranty. This was in Toronto, 3 dealers, so I phoned VWoC for their best 
choice. The mechanic had just completed a week long course on fuel 
injection, to no avail. They told me &quot;they all drive like this&quot;, so I sued 
in small claims court after an authorized Bosch centre replaced 3 components 
following 2 days of testing. VWoC settled out of court for the full amount, 
$2,500Cdn. This was after they had replaced the ECU brain twice.  Be 
persistant.   tim s.
