&gt; getting lotsa fuel dilution in the oil.  It was a small unit, only about 2
&gt; x 3 x 3 inches.  A dune buggy shop in San Diego installed it, so I can't

&gt; just like the stock pump.  Maybe someone else has one currently.  My 72 is
&gt; gone, but not forgot.

  I have an electric pump right now.  It works quite well with the 
exception that one of the wires got an intermittant connection and I 
would lose power randomly.  Once I fixed the wire it works fine.  I have 
seen electric pumps that come with a block off plate for the old 
mechanical pump hole.  Shouldn't be too hard to find I saw them in DB&amp;HVW.
