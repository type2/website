&lt;&lt; One month before I bought the van, the owner had the 5-speed transaxle
 replaced, cost him like 4k.  At the time the owner had 3 tires of the
 same brand and one different on the van..all of different tread.  After
 the transaxle rebuild he drove the van around 1k miles before we met in
 Arizona for the sale.  The first thing I did after I bought the van was
 get 4 new tires.  Here's where I have the question.
 On the inside door there is a sticker stating what tires should be used
 and proper inflation:
 
      Tire                  Inflation (front,rear)
     ______               __________________________
   185 R14C                      40/48
   205 R14C                      36/43.5
   205 70R1497R (??)             36/40
 
 So apparently I have 15 inch rims on the van...the guy at the tire store
 suggested I use 205 75R15 (made by crestwood?).  Well, I thought it was
 cool as long as I had 4 tires of the same tread/make so I went with
 them.  Now I wonder how I know if these tires are ok for my van?  The
 max inflation on the tires is 35 psi.... How do I know what the
 front/rear inflation ratio should be?  Do I need new tires?  &gt;&gt;

The max pressure of 35 psi is way too low for the load of a Syncro Westy.  To
low even for a 2wd passenger Vanagon.  What type/style/maker of 15&quot; rims do
you have? If you had normal 14&quot; rims (your 15&quot;ers are definitely NOT
standard) I'd recommend BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain T/A tires in size
27X8.50-14LT tires, wich are light truck (LT) tires with the proper load and
pressure ratings.  Their tread is a mild off-road design.  For your big 15&quot;
rims, perhaps the same tire in a 31&quot; diameter, but these may be too big and
cause clearance problems.

Your 205/75-15 tires are nearly two inches taller than the original 205/70-14
tires.  I'd suggest replacing your tires with tires of the proper load &amp;
pressure ratings.  And definitely get FIVE tires so that the spare will match
the other four.  Use a 5 tire rotation so that the spaer will wear and be the
same diameter as the rest.

A load rating of aroung 1800 lbs and pressure of 45 psi or more.

Good luck,
