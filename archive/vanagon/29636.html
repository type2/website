Subject: &quot;High Whine&quot; or &quot;Name that Tune&quot;

Now that I've got the '71 campmobile running, I've noticed a new noise. 
It's a pronounced high-pitched whine, resembling, but not quite like a
vacuum cleaner noise. 

The whine starts as soon as the engine's warmed up a little and gets
higher in pitch as RPMs increase. I don't think it's related to the tranny
since it occurs parked or moving. It's too loud to be a vacuum leak (I
think). 

It does go away momentarily when I start accelerating from a stop, but
there's only a brief region on the RPM scale where it doesn't occur. 

Idea 1: I'm inclined to think that the noise is from my fan, slightly
rubbing the outer edges of the housing. I'm thinking it all warms up and
the fan slides back just enough to barely rub. (Guess I could reach around
and spread some white grease around the place where I think it's rubbing
just to test this theory. If I'm right, the noise should go away for 5 or
10 miles.)

Idea 2: Also, (*I have to hang my head to admit this*), after the thread
on cooling flaps, I realized that I managed to install mine with the
spring holding the flaps CLOSED. Yikes! Well, instead of pulling the
engine now to fix things, I decided to reach around and pop the spring off
and let the flaps remain open. When I did, the spring jumped off into lala
land (you know, that area of the bus behind the shroud that you can
neither see or touch)...Another possible source of noise: the spring
rubbing metal. 

Idea 3: Since I was short on funds and plan to pull the engine at 300
miles for retorquing the heads, etc., I skipped the clutch disk
replacement and cleaned it up per a friend's instructions...figuring I
could eak out another 300 miles. Could this be the source of this new
sound? 

Any other ideas?

Thanks! Joe
