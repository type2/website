So Dan MacMillan says:
&gt;  I believe VW corrected this 'gas into the oil' fuel pump problem in '73,
&gt; when they added the little drain tube that hangs off the pump. If the 
&gt; rubber breaks, the fuel should drain onto the ground.
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  I wonder why they didn't just put in a reservoir instead?  ;)


  I'm sorry, but this was just too irresistable!
