&gt; I would also have to agree with Al and that's exactly what I thought also.
&gt; But, yesterday, someone posted the results of a demo in their shop class.
&gt; Pouring water on a radiator raised the engine temperature till the water
&gt; was gone from the radiator.  I am unable to correlate the two ... but maybe
&gt; I haven't though about it enough.

here's a likely scenario-

by pouring water on the radiator, the quantity of water held by 
capillary action in the fin space effectively reduces the air flow 
thru the radiator.  the net effect is like putting a blanket in front 
of the radiator.  there is some heat transfer as the water changes 
from liquid to gaseous phase but this is negated by the blocked air 
flow.  try the same experiment but very lightly spray the radiator 
with a *fine* mist, making sure the evaporation rate exceeds the 
accumulation rate and i think you'll see different results.
