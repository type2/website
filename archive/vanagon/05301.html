&gt; It is my understanding that it is a function of your OWN system's
&gt; particular mail (reading) program as to whether you receive your
&gt; vanagon mail showing the list or the original sender as sender.
&gt; I used to receive my vanagon mail at another address, where it
&gt; was always shown via original sender.
&gt; 

On my little system, if the From: field contains only the person's
email address, and not their name, then I get the sender as 
vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu. 

Thus Derek Drew's comments are always from vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu,
and Joel's show up as from &quot;Joel Walker&quot;.
