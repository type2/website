&gt;Busses on &quot;66&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Route 66&quot; by Bobby Troup (sp?))

Sounds good, Bob! And from L.A., we all take Hwy.1 to Vancouver to join
the Inuvik expedition. :-)

&gt;There's Sami in Saint Louie

Oui, oui :-)

And Bab in Missoura on farty-far...

Seriously, it's something I had intended on doing some day.
