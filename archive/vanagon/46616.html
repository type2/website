Apologies to those caught in the cross post.

I have a friend with an '82 Vanagon that has 'dropped' a valve.  The 
estimated cost of repairs has scared him into trying the repair 
himself.  He is thinking of replacing the heads and the P&amp;C's.  He has 
never done anything like this before but is willing to learn and also 
to pay someone for their time and expertise to walk him through this. 
He is located in Columbia, South Carolina.  Please reply to me and I 
will put him in contact with you.  Thanks, Jim
