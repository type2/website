&gt; Shawn,
&gt; 
&gt; I've never seen a Corrado oil filter....however, if the Corrado filter is 
&gt; the same as a Golf filter, then the EV filter is different. The EV filter is 
&gt; much bigger...diameter and length...than the Golf filter.

The Corrado is the same as the Golf (gas), except with the &quot;nut&quot; on 
the end. I did use Bosch filters on my Corrado with no problems, once 
I found a cap style wrech to use. The EV sounds more like a diesel 
filter with a nut on the end. Again, if a diesel filter, or some 
other type would work, it is possible to get a wrench to fit the end 
of the filter. EC just did an article suggesting that the larger 
diesel filter is a good upgrade for gas engines, so if it would fit 
the EV, can't see how it could hurt. And it's about half the price, 
even from the dealer.

from memory, the Golf gas filter is FRAM # PH2870a
the Golf diesel filter is FRAM # PH3508a
Can someone check the EV model # from FRAM?
