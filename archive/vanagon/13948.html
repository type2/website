You can buy a late style plate with the ring (collar) built in.  This
arrangement is an &quot;upgrade&quot; from the three finger variety, and works with
the early style t-o bearing.

T-O bearing and pressure plate incompatibility is not the problem with my
bus.  The parts are compatible, yet I still suffer from exploding t-o
bearings.

&gt; It has been fine for over two years, but with
&gt;hindsight I would change the release bearing.

You can only change the release bearing (to the later Sachs style) if you
change the transaxle.  The later transaxle has three studs around the input
shaft on which the metal guide tube is fastened.  The later style release
bearing is in no way compatible with the early (pre 1971) transaxle, with
the early cross-shaft, or pressure plates with a ring (collar).
