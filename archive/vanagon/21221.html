Subject: Vanagon Oil Pressure gauge

Hey yall-

I was planning on installing a electric oil pressure gauge in 
my 84 westie.  However, there are two oil pressure sensors for 
the idiot light:  one at the water pump and one between the two 
cyls on the drivers side of the engine.   Bentley's shows that 
the one between the cyls is a low pressure gauge while the one 
on the water pump is a high pressure gauge.  Does it matter 
which one I tap into to get an accurate oil pressure.  I 
release that pressure is pressure no matter where you read it 
in the system (I do have a physics degree...) however, I don't 
know if the sensor on the water pump is a BETTER spot for it.  
It is certainly easier to get to..

Any wisdom or experience would help....

Phil
