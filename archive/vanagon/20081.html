Subject: Re: Weber DFEV's and heat

&gt;I had asked about the Weber Progressive DFEV carb and got mostly 
&gt;positive responses.  It seems that some electrical part of the carb 
&gt;hits the fan housing but can be fixed.  One person had theirs running 
&gt;rich but expected to fix that with a jet change.  So, I think I have 
&gt;decided to go this way and save some money and headaches over duals.  
&gt;I have one more question first:  How does one provide heat to this 
&gt;carb to keep it from icing?  I know some setups use your stock 
&gt;oil-bath air cleaner.  Does this one?  It will be replacing the 
&gt;34PICT3 on a 1600DP in a '71 bus.  Thanks, Jim

Well, Jim,

Though I have read Veedubbers treatise on the progressive carb, I still find
the advantages of the dual carb to outweigh the disadvantages.  The
elimination of carb icing is the main one, though I think the performance of
the dual carbs is almost as helpful.  It is true that changing plugs sucks,
but the amount of pull up hills, and overall performance I get with the
duals is worth it to me.  It is also true that with a single progressive you
can use the stock air cleaner, keeping fumes out of your engine and cabin,
which is a silent but notorious problem with duals.

Eug,
