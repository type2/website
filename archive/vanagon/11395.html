Subject: Re: '56 kombi - update

&gt;	Anyway, the nice thing about doing that is that now I actually have
&gt;decent acceleration!  This bus books now!  I was only getting about 
&gt;1/2 - 3/4 throttle before, and now I have it all!

Talk about busses bookin'.  I had a 63 Kombi that I drove to Minnesota when 
I moved from San Jose, CA.  I had a custom tranny built and used a 1600 DP 
motor out of a 72 Beetle.  When I experienced my first Tornado Warning in a 
little town's Pizza Hut in Nebraska I got in my bus and did 75-80 MPH for 
about an hour.  Boy that bus ran.  2400 miles and only a quart of oil.
