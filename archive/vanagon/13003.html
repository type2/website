Subject: Hi, I'm new!

Well, I'm actually over 30, but I'm new to this listserve!
I've just purchased an 82 Westfalia with 159,000 miles on an engine that was
rebuilt at 111,000.  Plan on leaving April 1st for a drive around the US,
going counter clockwise.  When I hit Houston, I'll fly down to Mexico for a
nice visit, and then continue up the east coast and back home to Seattle
accross the top (or perhaps Canada).  Although I don't plan on checking email
while I'm gone, I may drop messages into the listserve via friend's email
accounts as I travel the US.  I have a few repairs to make before I go, (ie,
the cloth that covers the front window for camping doesn't seem to fit right
(perhaps it's User Error) and the sink's pump (an aftermarket) isn't working.
 I also haven't used the stove or fridge yet so who knows what I'm looking at
there.  

OK, so here's a few quesions.
1.  Can you name some other VW Camper related places to visit on the Net?
2.  How do I get the FAQ's mentioned?
3.  Can someone recommend a good RV place to get my kitchen checked out/fixed
in the Seattle Area?

Thanks in advance.  After seeing how well you treated the guy who asked what
BTW means, I knew this was a great place to be.  Then again, I already
guessed vanagon owners were best!
