Subject: disconnecting syncro driveshaft


List members,

Would there be any ill effects from disconnecting the syncro drive sh=

 This may improve gas mileage and eliminate (?) possibility of damage=
 to the=20
viscous clutch during a long drive.

I know that this would defeat the purpose of having the syncro, but I=
 am=20
considering a late spring/early summer cross country drive and would =
like to=20
make the drive more economy (ecological) minded and also reduce chanc=
e of=20
wear and tear to the van.

What are List thoughts on this modification?

later,
