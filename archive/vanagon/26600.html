Subject: Moving to Colorado

Hi, or howdy y'all-

As some of you all know, I'm moving to Buena Vista (Colorado) in two weeks.
And as Joel pointed out to me, we have listmembers there. Also, 
some people on this list may have lived in CO for awhile.

I have not.
Nor have I driven there in the fall (read: snow).

So I'd like thoughts, advice, suggestions, warnings -- you name it -- 
reagarding this move. And on the state. Vehicle inspections? Recommended
ski areas? Restaurants? Routes of travel from Seattle? High altitude bus 
modifications? I dunno... Whatever!

Just thought I'd tap the collective brain before journeying 1,500 miles 
to a town of 2,500....   =)   

Jeff (who's pulling out the tire chains and waxing up the skis!)
