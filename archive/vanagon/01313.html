Subject:      Porcupines in Pantyhose. Barbecued Brake Lines. Inquiring minds
 want to know!

lemme see here now ... we've got porcupines eating tires and brake lines.
we've got Ralf and Jim working on vw's in panties and a braaaaa ... and
we've got the rubber-hose-fan-belt-brake-line-eating Little Foot out in
the woods who makes you drag a log to get down the mountain if you didn't
bring the concertina wire to surround your car.

are you guys SURE it's not Friday?
