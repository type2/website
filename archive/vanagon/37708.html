&gt;Hi folx,
&gt;
&gt;I have two questions today:
&gt;
&gt;First, what is the procedure for replacing a non-windshield window?
&gt;Is it pretty much the same as the windshield procedure?  I.e., the
&gt;cord wrapped inside the window seal, one person inside pulling the
&gt;cord, and one person outside pushing?  I need to replace the sliding
&gt;window in the cargo door of a 78.  On a scale of 1 (v. difficult) to
&gt;10 (v. easy), how would you rate the difficulty of this?  It *sounds*
&gt;easy, but what problems am I likely to run into?
&gt;
&gt;Second, what are the most common causes of a spark plug that
&gt;repeatedly works itself loose?  This is a bus I just bought last
&gt;weekend, and I've discovered this twice now on #3 sparkplug.  I can
&gt;tell it's loose when it starts making a chirping noise like someone
&gt;else was describing on his 81 Vanagon; I go back and check, and sure
&gt;enough, it's loose again.  Tighten it down, and the chirping subsides
&gt;considerably (although not altogether).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Rodney

Rodney,  

Yes, the other fixed windows are removed and installed just as a windshield
is.

and

Black moly grease on the sparkplug threads before installation helps ensure
proper torque (facilitating proper washer crush) and won't allow the plugs to
work back out on their own.  I didn't believe this at first, but after a five
year VW Audi repair apprenticeship, I am a firm believer in proper assembly
lubrication.  One added benefit of using this grease is that you'll never
pull threads out with a plug again!
