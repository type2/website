&gt; I'm going to pick up our Vanagon diesel tomorrow. 
 
Welcome! We need more diesel owners on the list. Once the diesels
outnumbered the synchros on Joel's statistics. Unfortunetely now
they outnumber us 2:1 or so. If VWUS only had imported the (turbo)
diesel synchro...

&gt; Also, for anyone who has an appropriate Bently manual:

The pull the engine ot trans&quot; question was already answered I believe.
As for Bentley, it's nice to have your own. For diesel engine info
there is a cheaper &quot;diesel golf jetta&quot; Bentley (less than half price
compared to the vanagon Bentley). I used this one together with the
Haynes aircooled vanagon manual before I got the real vanagon Bentley.


&gt; Also, I'd like to quiz fellow diesel owners on their personal cold start and
&gt; driving habits.  

In it's younger days my diesel started without problems even in the
coldest Rochester weather. Nowdays I use a block heater when at home.
If away from home, and the engine is really cold I often glow the glow
plugs 2 to 4 times before cranking. I have the fast glows (10s) and
a stong battery. Without this repeated glowing the engine would often
start, but then die after a few seconds.

&gt; ...running on probably 1-1/2 cylinders.  If I gently bring the revs up 
&gt; to around 1100 for a few seconds and the drop back down I'm up to 
&gt; 3 cylinders...

The first thing to check is that all glow plugs are working. This can be done
with an ampere meter. I think the fast glows should draw about 10A each
so nr of ok glowplugs = current /10. I dont have a 50 A meter, so I
usually chech them when I pull my injectors. The glowplugs turn
red hot when on, and it is easy to see them with the injectors removed.

&gt; I haven't decided if the cold start lever
&gt; is making it start faster or not.  I have noticed that it runs better if I
&gt; push it in almost right away.

The cold start lever supposedely advances the timing. If I remember correctly
its only 2 degrees or so. Mine defenetily starts easier with the cold
start lever out. VW tells us to use the cold start regardless whether
the engine is hot or cold. I don't know when to push it in. I usually 
push it in at first sign of the engine warming up, but sometimes forget
to do it at all.

&gt; I'd like to hear how some of the rest of you get your diesels to life in the
&gt; morning.

&gt; I know I should get a block heater, but it rarely gets very cold here.  It's
&gt; going to be a hassle rigging it up, as I park in the street out in front of
&gt; my house, and there's a public sidewalk between.  As an added bonus, when I
&gt; bring home the Vanagon tomorrow I'll need two cords.  

On heating your engine without electricity: Someone mentioned a week ago
or so that JC Withney sells an external coolant heater. I flipped though
the new catalog, but couldn't find it. I can tell you how it works on
a Scania TGB 30/40: 

The heating system consists of an extra electric coolant circulation
pump, and an extra rugged &quot;heater core&quot; like thing. It is hooked
up to the regular engine cooling system. Cold weather starting goes
as follows:

1. Start the MEGA BIG diesel powered blow torch (This is a 300 HP
turbo diesel powering a 6 wheel drive all terrain truck)

2. Start the electric circulation pump.

3. Hang blow torch so it blows directly into the heater core thing.

4. Wait a few minutes until warm coolant has circulated and warmed
up the whole engine.

5. Turn off torch and pump. Start engine.

On older trucks we used to just go around an heat various 
parts of engine, brakes etc directly with the blowtorch to get going 
in the morning. This was military practice though. Civilians may want
to be more careful.

&gt; Anybody have any clue
&gt; as to the current flow on a block heater?

Mine measures 35 Ohms cold. ==&gt; 110^2/35 = 346 Watts
				110/35 = 3.1 Ampere

Current draw when hot may be slightly different. 

Attached below are some cold start tips from Jack Ewald's WWW page:

Sorry about the appearance, the formattiong didn't work.

Happy dieseling,
Martin and my '82 Westy

1¾pain in the winter. ----------------------------------------------------------- This
will Help ! ------------------- Remember Water in your fuel filter will stop you cold. Drain at least every 7500
miles. ( I change every 7500 miles) ------------------------------------------------------
1- We need good clean winterized fuel ( use STP Diesel Fuel Treatment if in doubt) 2- We need a good Battery Not older
than 3-yrs and 685 CCA. 3- We need a good starter that will spin the motor over fast enough. 4- We need enough
compression 395 psi (minimum) all should be close. 5- We need to not have a leaking head gasket. 6- We need the
injection pump to not be leaking fuel &amp; the cold start devise to work. 7- If all of the above check out then : 8- Check the
Glow Plug Relay. Use a test lamp connected to the first Glow Plug to the right side ( or rear on Dasher or Quantum) then
ground the other side of the lead. Turn the Ign, switch on ( not start) and if the test lamp stays on about 8-seconds after
you dash light goes out the Relay is Good. Otherwise Replace! This assumes you have checked the 50amp fusable link
Fuse on the firewall an it is not blown. 9- Next to test the Glow plugs. I'll give you an easy way but it is Hot. Cycle your
Pre. Glow Dash light on through 3 cycles. Then Touch each Glow Plug The HOT ones are good warm or cold replace. You
Might Might start on 3 Good Plugs but 2 Forget it. 10- Thick Oil is also a problem I use 20w-50 till the temp. gets to and
stays around 10 degrees (F) above then I go to 10w-40. Hint: The Diesel likes a little fuel added with the throttle (winter
starting) as you are cranking. Hint 2: If you car is going to start it will fire in the first 20 seconds. If after the above fails then
you may E-Mail me at: vwdiesel_at_jackewald.win_dot_net Jack EwaldReplace! This assumes you have checked the 50amp
fusable link Fuse on the fire€
