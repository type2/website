Subject: Type II &amp; Plastiguage?


I'm picking up a rebuilt crank for the current 1600 project tomorrow. I
presume it will be ground undersize. I've always dealt with shortblocks
before in VWs.

Muir's take on FLAPS and machinists seems to be that they're reliable,
competent, trustworthy people, but.._dot_call me an agnostic by experience. I
know there's not a lot I can do about the mains but check their math, but
it'd go a long way toward &quot;workmanlike&quot; if I could at least plastiguage the
rods be absolutely sure.

But I don't know how the stripe ought to be. Should I just do it like I
would in the Jeep? Would an aircooled run tighter or sloppier? Hey, we're
supposed to adjust the valves so they *clatter*, so I thought I'd better
ask. ;)
