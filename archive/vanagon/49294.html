Subject: Re: Mouse Milk?

&gt;What is Mouse Milk and where do you get it and is it expensive? Is it
&gt;really better than WD-40?


Ooooooo.... I wish it were Friday...  ;-&gt;

Are you using it to lubricate, free rusted things, or protect from rust? Some
products are better than WD-40 for some applications, but all around I like
WD-40. It's what I keep in my van toolbox. I haven't heard of  &quot;Mouse Milk,&quot;
though, so I can't speak for or against it. Liquid Wrench excells at &quot;loosening&quot;
rusted connectors, but it works best if it is allowed to soak for a long time (&lt;
1 hour).

Oh, BTW, I saw a VW Euro today, A HUGE one. Did it say Caravel on the side? I
can't remember. Man, it was the biggest VW I've ever seen. I woulda never known
if it wasn't for the VW emblem on the grill. Even my kids wouldn't believe that
it was a VW until they saw the grill, and they're veteran spotters. Wow. I can't
believe it is powered by that 5 cylinder engine. Or is it?
