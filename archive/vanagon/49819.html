Subject: belly pan query

Can anyone provide enough info for me to remanufacture the panel for a 62
split that covers the area between the chassis under the gearlever and
handbrake floor area.
In the UK all the other belly pans are available but the one most commonly
taken off and lost. I am sure with sufficient info the split screen club
could get them remade.
Thanks in advance

Will Ryan
