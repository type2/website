&gt; 
&gt; Did you mention you replaced the power steering with manual rack &amp; pinion???
&gt;  I've been wondering if that is feasible when my power steering gives up.


No, the air-cooled Vanagons never had power steering.  

&gt; 
&gt; I'm also toying around with the idea of replacing the VW engine with a 2.2L
&gt; Subaru Legacy engine.  I've been in touch with Kennedy Engineered Products
&gt; about it.  However, I don't take the change lightly.  I'll be looking for
&gt; opinions about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, no offense intended.
&gt;

I wasn't offended.  I was just relating my experiences driving crappy
vans and comparing that to driving a real van :-)
