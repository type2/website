Subject: 12v gererator part #  anybody have it?

does anybody have the part # for the porsche 12v gererator that cam on 
the older ones?  this is the one that mounts the voltage regulator on top 
like older 6v units.  hot VW's said something about it in tech talk a few 
years ago, but i can not find it.  anybody remember?
thanks and Gog Bless
