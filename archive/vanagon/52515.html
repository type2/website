Subject: Need interior fabric

 &gt;&gt; My question is, is there a source for fabric for the interior for
 Vanagons?  &lt;&lt;

 Jay:

 The only help I can offer is a line from the most recent LiMBO newsletter
where Stan Wolfarth sez:

 &quot;I was able to get Sewfine to produce Vanagon seat front seat covers recently
so they have a pattern now...&quot;

 I tossed my Sewfine catalog recently because while they featured a wide range
of fabrics, they didn't have a thing for Vanagons.  Seems that now they do. 
Try the 800 number information line, maybe Sewfine has an answer.



 P.S. How's my front bumper coming along?
