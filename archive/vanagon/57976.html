I prefer a plain, old, catsup and whipped cream sandwich...

I am installing several gauges.  Which ones should I be sure to include?
Which ones don't I need.

I built a box thingee that sits on my dash right next to the instrument
cluster and that holds my stereo and up to 5 gauges.  I covered it with the
same foam backed fabric my dash mat is made out of -- ordered it from the
company -- and it looks pretty good.  No I just have to fill it up.  Oh,
and fix the engine...
