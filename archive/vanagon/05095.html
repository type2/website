&gt; So Lex Cowley says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The easiest way to describe this vehicle is to say it is a cross between a
&gt; &gt; Thing and a Myers Manx buggy. The body is completely made from steel, but
&gt; &gt; has no doors, a fold down windscreen, softop, with a bench back seat that
&gt; &gt; folds down and turns into a metal tray to carry bales of hay, etc.. around.
&gt; &gt; The exhaust curves up into the body and comes out of two oval holes above
&gt; &gt; the rear bumper, to give better ground clearence. There is also an
&gt; &gt; attachment that runs off the motor and runs a pulley outside the vehicle
&gt; &gt; that can be used to run a pump, and other farm devices. These vehicles are
&gt; &gt; becoming quite collectible here in Australia and are starting to demand quit
&gt; &gt; a price.
&gt; 
&gt; So why did they stop making them?  From the sound of your description, I'm
&gt; going to have to change my dream car selection to one of these buggys. 
&gt; I wish I could get FTP'd the pictures but I don't have ftp access. :(
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!
