&gt;here are their estimates  of the current values of Syncro 
&gt;Westies (Camper GLs with Syncro option):

&lt;list of crazy prices snipped&gt;

Sweet suffering zot!!!

Where do prices come from???   The retail in Ireland for a 1.9L 

diesel Transporter T4, new and with *no* (and I mean NO) extras 

is currently the equivalent of $20,000.  How in the name of all 

that's good 'n' holy can VW ship 'em across the pond and around 

the continent for that price and have the *gall* to sell 'em 
here, 1000 miles from Germany, for more?!!

I'm just getting warmed up for a reeeeal good flame to VAG.

Steamed-up Bushrat.  :*
