Subject: Probs with starter



I took my '66 to Michigan again (1500 miles round trip) and experienced a bit 
of a hitch with the starter.  A few times on the trip, and all the way home,
I found that when I put the key in the ignition position, nothing happened.

I had to start the car using a screw driver to jump the terminals on the 
starter.

The wierd thing is, everything is working fine again.

I've checked the wiring and it _seems_ fine.

I was wondering, could this be the solenoid?

Thanks,
...Markus
