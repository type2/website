&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Does anyone have ANY success stories involving an &quot;easy-out&quot; that's actually
&gt; &gt;WORKED? Or are these gadgets the mechanical equivalent of Slick-50?
&gt; 
My success with easy outs is but two.  The trick seems to be to drill 
that sucker out as much as possible.  That is, use the biggest easy 
out.  Removing the metal from the center of the bolt/stud takes some 
of the pressure off of the threads.  The more you remove the better.  
Of course, be careful not to drill out the threads themselves.  Also, 
use gobs of liquid wrench or similar.  You knew that.  Jim
