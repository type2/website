Subject: RE: Campers: Request for General Information

&gt;I'm another newbie who's joined the list before buying. In my case, I'm
&gt;looking to buy a bread-loaf camper, probably a 75-78 based on what I've
&gt;learned so far.

&gt;Thanks to J. Walker, I have a file that describes the changes made to each
&gt;model year of bus (that information is what leads me to want a 75-78
&gt;bread-loaf). 

Why stop at '78? I can tell you - having owned a '78 Westfalia - that you
really want a '79, at least as far as the camp gear goes. The big
difference is that the '78 fridge is this hairbrained scheme that opens
from the top like an ice chest, so you have to pull everything out to get
to anything. '79 Westfalias have a more sensible front opening fridge. I do
not know if it's the same Dometic propane/electric model that is found in
later model Westys, but it may be.

Paul
