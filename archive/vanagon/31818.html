Al Knoll tests our knowledge with:

&gt;syncro...GTI motor, quite small, nicely colored with two doors and a
snowbored
&gt;rack on top...said syncro on the back. So ye of great knowledge and broad

Well, Al, you mentioned &quot;tiny&quot; and &quot;quite small&quot; so I'm guessing it's a Mini 
Cooper w/ a GTI motor shoehorned in....   ;-)
