Subject: AZ Bus Club Campout details (again)

Due to several inquiries I am happy to repost the details as I know them.
Unfortunately I dont have the flyer in front of me.

The Arizona Bus Club is having a &quot;camping&quot; get together at the American
Legion Post 109 in/near Tucson, AZ, USA. Near Tucson take the I-10 exit 275
at &quot;Houghton.&quot; Sorry but the flyer doesn't have an address on it so the
phone book is the best bet.  It is supposedly in or near &quot;Corona de Tucson&quot;
whatever that means. Costs are minimal. $1or charitable nonperishable food
donation  to get in and/or $5.00 to camp and/or swap. Caravan leaves Phoenix
at 7 am from a location near the intersection of I-10 and Baseline Road.
Rusty VanBondo beleives the real location is a nearby KMart parking lot. The
caravan will definitely cruise by the intersection thatI mentioned. The
caravan will stop  to cool the fins at the Circle K in Toltec. I figure the
crowd will cruise into Tucson around about 10:30-11 am. Have fun, don't
imbibe and drive and enjoy your bad old selves once you get there! Thanks to
Jerry and Melissa  Jess for the details. According to the Jess' there has
been alot of interest in the event and should be a good showing.
For more information please call:
Jon Stanton (602) 877-8662 events coordinator
or Pat Kelly (602) 263-0684  president, ABC

Tell 'em VanBondo sent you!

It would be appreciated if someone would post this to the Vintagvw list and
the rec.aircooled.whatever. Thanks!
