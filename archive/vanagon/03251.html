&gt;Ummm... that's cause the Eurovan is the only minivan made in Europe.  At
&gt;least the only mainstream one.  Of course it's going to sell well there.
&gt;

What makes it a 'minivan' rather than plain 'van'? There are dozens of 
similar vehicles around in Europe. Fiat, Citroen, Renualt, Ford, and (soon) 
GM all make similar vans. A lot of them outsell the Eurovan because it is 
comparitively expensive. Previously VW sold more vans to the public (as 
campers and microbuses), than to commercial customers who are more concerned 
with purchase and maintainence costs. Most of the Vanagons and air-cooled 
buses you see in Europe are campers. (The case is different in Germany, and 
Barzill too, because VWs are relativley cheap there). With the Eurovan, 
Volkwagen are aiming to take custom from their rivals with a more 
conventional van. Making it front engined and front wheel drive also saved 
them developing a new engine and transmission. But what makes the Eurovan a 
commercial success is the same thing that makes it unappealing to VW 
enthusiasts. Its the same as all those other vans out there. Who would get 
excited about a 20 year old Transit?
