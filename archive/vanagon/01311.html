&gt; Okay, okay.  I'll take a stab at it.  Hmm...  Let's see...
&gt; Alright!  Sung to the tune of Monty Python's 'I'm a lumberjack
&gt; and I'm Okay'
&gt; 
&gt; I love my Volksie and it's okaaaay...
&gt; Drive hills and dales the live long daaay...
&gt; Give it oil and gas and it smiles awaaay...
&gt; I wear panties and a braaa...   &lt;well, maybe not&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I love my Volksie and it's okaaay...
&gt; I don't care what people saaay...
&gt; As I'm passed on the hiighhwaaay...
&gt; I wear panties and a braaa....   &lt;well, if it starts, why not&gt;
&gt; 
  I love my Volksie and it's okaaay...
  People look at me in a funny waaay...
  When I'm working on her night and daaay....
  I wear panties and a braaa....   &lt;It's the VW, right? perhaps not&gt;
