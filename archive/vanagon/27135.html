SSTONES says:

&gt;Hell, In the non catalytic, carburated engines, all you have to do is
&gt;shut off the ignition while still moving and in gear...
&gt;This will fill up your exhaust with plenty of air/fuel...

I had a 74 Monte Carlo(what is it about that year) that had glass pack
muffers on it, and of course, being that I was in the Military, it was
badly out of tune, as all my money went to Beer, and pizza. Well, when
driving on the freeway, it I would let off on the gas pedal, the car
would backfire, LOUDLY. That would always discourage tailgators. Infact,
one time I was passing a Winnebago, and when I got around it I let off
the gas to slow to the speedlimit, and I backfired. When I looked in the
rear view mirror, the RV had pulled off the road to check for a flat.

Cheers,

David
