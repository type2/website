&gt; how and where did you get your information on how to do it? any help
&gt; would be greatly appreciated, thank you

i asked the list about what places could help me with getting the various
kits (clutch, transmission, etc.), and i was told for VW conversions, call
Kennedy Engineered Products in palmdale, California.  i don't have their
tel.no. handy, but you might want to ask on the list.
