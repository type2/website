&gt; &gt; I found a great way to keep those piece-au-shit (like mine) 
&gt; vanagons running &gt; and be able to have hassle -ree trips. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Buy a FORD full-towing truck. The ones that actually put the whole car/van on
&gt; &gt; their bed. Put the van on the truck, and drive the truck wherever your heart
&gt; &gt; desires, unload the VAN and camp galore! Do the same to get back home!
&gt; &gt; This towing-truck is absolutely the ultimate VW owner companion. Don't leave
&gt; &gt; home without it.
Better yet, why not get one of those 100' winnebago land-yachts, and tow
the bus behind it?
Then you can put your mother-in-law, dog, kids, or other folks back
there that can't fit in the &quot;real&quot; camper
:)
