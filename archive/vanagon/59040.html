Subject: NHTSA Recall
From: georgejoann_at_juno_dot_com (George Jannini)
Date: Mon, 28 Apr 1997 11:14:36 EDT


     The NHTSA issued the following recall for the month of February:

   Volkswagen of America, 1997 Volkswagen EuroVan manufactured between
August and Nov. '96 (201 vehicles)    NHTSA recall # 97V016001, VW
campaign # SL.

    The models are unfinished campers produced by VW and finished by
Winnebago industries.  During the installation of the camper equipment,
an improperly adjusted power tool drill bit punctured the fuel tank vapor
cannister.  This can allow fuel vapors to escape and could cause a fire. 
VW dealers, on behalf of Winnebago, will check the fuel vapor container
for the defect and replace the fuel tank if necessary.
