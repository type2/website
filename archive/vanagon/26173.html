Subject: Intro and Thanks

Hello, everyone.  My name is Cliff Hungerford, and I currently live in St.
Louis, MO.
I subscribed to the list over a month ago, and have thoroughly enjoyed the
stories, reports, technical info, and especially the FFFFriday Follies!

I currently own a 1988 Vanagon GL with overhead a/c, fold down rear
seat/bed...the rest is pretty vanilla.  Oh, yeah...it's a manual
transmission, 2.1 liter engine, etc. etc.

I've owned a few VW's over the years, my favorite of which was a '64 bug
(with a '59 engine), affectionately referred to as the &quot;Bruise-Mobile&quot; by my
friends, due to the purplish blotches caused by the unpainted Bondo that
comprised the largest portion of structural integrity in the car.  I
originally bought the car for US $50.00 in Berlin while stationed there in
the Air Force.  After &quot;repairing&quot; all of the rust, putting on new tie rod
ends, etc., etc., the flywheel started getting chewed up, cog by cog, until I
finally had to start parking on hills to be sure of an easy start-up.  When I
finally dropped the engine and took the flywheel (a fun task, to be sure) to
various junkyards/parts places, everybody laughed at me (sounds the same in
German) and told me to get rid of the beast.  I sold it to the on-base
mechanics shop for $150.00.  Not a bad return on my investment!  Since then,
I've owned a couple of K70's (precursor to the Jetta, sold only in Germany,
as far as I know), an '84 Jetta, '86 Quantum, and the '88 Vanagon.

The Vanagon currently has 92,000 miles, and has only needed one new head
gasket, rear brake shoes and a new starter, so I guess I'm pretty lucky.  I
am having a problem finding a slow leak in the cooling system.  Like another
recent posting, I can smell coolant (but only outside the van, not inside)
after driving to or from work, but there is not a real significant loss
(maybe a cup or so every couple of weeks).  Is this even worth chasing down?
 I've been as thorough as I could in finding the leak, but can't tell where
it's coming from.  I'm mainly afraid that if it's a hose, it could be getting
ready to blow one of these days.

I was getting ready to trade the Vanagon in on an American-made van, but
since I've found all of you out there, I think I'll hang on to it for a few
decades, and see how it holds up.  Thanks again for the help, entertainment,
and generosity you all seem to provide.

Cliff
