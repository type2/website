greetings all,

i just spotted in my &quot;european car&quot; magazine last night a
pic of the VR6 Caravelle that's supposed to be slated for
the US/North American market.

it basically looks like a Eurovan with a slightly longer hood,
slightly rounded facia surrounding the grille and dual
sliding rear doors (w/ sliding windows that open).
 
mechanically it's supposed to have a &quot;de-tuned&quot; 140hp
VR6 (this would be the narrow angle, 15 degree, V-6 that's
trying hard to be an I-6).  &quot;normal&quot; VR6 motors in the 
corrado, jetta, golf are in the 172-178 (or so)hp range.

for those awaiting a 6 cyl. motor in the current EV body, this
might do it for you, but having lived w/ my 5 cyl. for a 
couple years, i think i'm gonna pass on this offering...
