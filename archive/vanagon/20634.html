&gt; Well, since it's come up, what causes that hard pulling when you first
&gt; stop? My '67 has only recently started doing that, and as far as i can
&gt; tell, none of the cylinders are leaking. It pulls really hard to the
&gt; right the first 3 or 4 times I stop, then is fine, then starts to pull
&gt; to the left. What might be behind this?

I had this problem too, and I thought it was sticky calipers.  I got
another set of calipers and took my right front caliper off to replace
it.  I was all ready with a piece of plastic and rubber band to block
the line when I pulled it out of the caliper, but lo and behold, when I
disconnected the line, nothing came out!  Turns out the hose was
partially blocked, even though it looked great from the outside, so 
I replaced it.  End of problem.
