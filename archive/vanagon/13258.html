Subject:       Re: Syncro Westie With the Front CV (Black and) Blues

Jon asked:

I'd like to get some input on the front CVs, i.e. How long have your front CVs 
lasted?  How much did it cost in US$ for each CV?  How much was the overall 

I don't know how much they are, but I have the same vehicle with 
112000 km (approx 70000 miles).  I had the CV's checked at my last 
service (4000 km ago), and they are all fine.  Sounds like a 
premature failure :(  Check with your dealer if there is some sort of 
&quot;goodwill&quot; for this failure.

These parts should last over 160000 km (100000 miles).

Harry.
