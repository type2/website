Subject: Re: wanted: mech./shop recommendation (Raleigh, NC)

&gt; Anybody have a person or shop in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill area they'd
&gt; like to recommend to work on replacing head gaskets for an 89' Westy.  I've got
&gt; a couple that I've come up with but would always welcome more.  

I'd like to reccommend Sean, at Transporter Werks...he did a great job 
fixing up different stuff on my '71...he is on West street in 
Raleigh...sorta in the downtown part...his number is 8342800...I 
think...don't shoot me if that is wrong...anyways...good luck
