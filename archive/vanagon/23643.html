&gt; one day at work, back in about 1979, the manager of the Customer Engineers
&gt; comes in, all pissed off at the world. seems that he had seen an ad in the

&gt; &quot;Mercedes-Benz, 4-door, like new, $100.&quot; yeah, right. well, that's what he
&gt; thought, too. so he ignored it.

The really amazing part of this story is that I told this to a woman at a 
garage sale this afternoon.  Sounds like it's time to start reading 
alt.urban.folklore again...
