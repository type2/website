Hello, Patrick, and All--
We're parting out an '85 Vanagon this week. It had 48,ooo miles on it 
when it was rolled a few years ago. Body is twisted, so there's almost no 
perfectly straight body panel, but the interior is great. We're keeping 
the more significant things (motor, transmission, front seats) but middle 
and rear seats are available, as well as assorted interior panels, glass 
(front windshield destroyed in accident). We have front seats from 
another Vanagon, however: from an '84. They are called Recaro style, I 
think, and are unlike any others I've seen (blue cloth with black trim, 
contoured, with arm rests). They came from a Canadian Westy, so perhaps 
they are more familiar to our friends north of the border.

This is the first Vanagon we've ever parted out, but there will be more 
in the future, I am sure. Please contact us with your needs.
