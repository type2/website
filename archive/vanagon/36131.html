Subject: Gas Smell

Hello all

I going to make an offer on a 1986 Vanagon GL. It needs some work but what 
concerns me alittle is the owner says that when the tank is full he can smell 
gas. When the tank gets off of full it goes away.  He said that there was a 
&quot;T&quot; fitting on top of the tank that needs repalcing. I am going through the 
Bently book right now to see what I can see.  Any one have any Ideas on this??

Thanks in advance,
