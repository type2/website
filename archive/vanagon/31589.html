Subject: Tune Up Question: Distributor &amp; Timing

Perhaps someone can help me...

I am about to do my first tune-up _ever_ on my '71 Bus (I'm a city boy,
don't you know).  I've read the procedure outlined by St. Muir, and there
are a few things I'm having trouble understanding...

1) Regarding the Distributor-- I pulled off the cap to look at the points.
Muir says there is a screw to adjust them, yet I couldn't see it at all.
Also, there's not a lot of room in the engine compartment to manuver--any
suggestions?

2) Regarding timing-- Muir says to use a static light. Fine.  But the
timing chart notes: 5 degrees ATDC, strobe timing mark at idle vaccum hose
on.  Ok, here's the problem.  I'm doing the tune-up because she doesn't
idle properly or not at all, actually, so how am I to set the timing
correctly if she doesn't idle and I have no static timing mark?

3) Muir mentions using a &quot;solvent&quot; to clean parts.  Which do you recommend?

I would appreciate any help on this/comments.
