Subject: Re: J.C. Whitney cylinders???

&gt;
&gt;Has anyone bought cylinder/piston sets fron J.C. Whitney? Are they 
&gt;good quality? If they are bad quality where should I order them from?

I bought mine (85.5 mm  Mahle) from Whitney for $79 in 1992.  I didn't prep
them in any way or make any measurements as Bob wisely suggests, though I
did check to see that the rings were installed correctly (they were).  I
have 50-60k on them now and still have great compression. I think they go
for $89 these days--don't know what brand Whitney currently supplies.
