&gt;Problem is, the stuff that came out was milky looking. I assume my gas
&gt;somehow has gotten water in it.  The problems seem have occurred since my
&gt;last fill up and I am now on the bottom quarter of the tank.
&gt;Any comments regarding what I should do to drain the tank and whether or
&gt;not any damage has been done?  Besides changing the filter, is there
&gt;anything else I should do to try to purge the system or clean it out once
&gt;I drain the tank?

Milky? That does not sound like water. As a pilot I routinely draw samples
of gas out of tanks to check for water, and often see it. But it appears,
in a clear container filled primarily with gas, on the bottom as a clear
&quot;bubble&quot;, perhaps containing rust or other contaminants. Of the hundreds
of times I have seen water in gasoline, it has never appeared as &quot;milky&quot;.
Did anyone use a sealant on your tank? An oil/water emulsion might appear
milky...I guess.
