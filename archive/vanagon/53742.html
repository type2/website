Hi all:

     So many people answered my query about Calif. emmisions, Thank
you.  Now I have one more about Idaho.  Does Coer d'lene, Idaho, have
emissions testing?  I know Spokane has very stringent testing, and I was
wondering if Idaho is considered part of the same airshed, and if so, do
they have to test also?

     By way of explanation for these questions:  We are working with a
local legislator who has offered to introduce legislation for Washington
that would release some of the older cars ('68 - '75) from testing, but
he wanted to know what other west-coast and neighboring states are doing
first.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

     Thanks.

Todd Francis
