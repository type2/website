Subject: 75K Service w/ One minor problem

Just want to let everyone know that my 75K service went fine.
My mechanic never called me during the day at work to say
'well I've got some bad news and some good news'.  Now how many
bus/van/euro owners can say that!  The only work that needed to
be done was what I took it in for.  '95's starting out great.
He did have to replace a non-working oxygen sensor (i also was
having it smogged).

So, now I'm set for a mini R/T over the next week.  I'm off to
N. Cal for a training class and next weekend I'm staying up
there and continuing to Napa valley.  Should be around a 1,000
mile trip.  Work was willing to pay for flying but I said 'no way -
I'm driving to San Jose'.  I was hoping to hit the Pfiefer group
along the way but since I can't get out of O.C. (that's right,
the same bankrupt O.C.) until Sunday, it wouldn't work out.
