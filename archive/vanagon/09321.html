Subject: Re: another edition of the dictionary  ...


&gt;&gt;BTW--did anyone call them Westphalias before the Vanagon era,
&gt;&gt;when they emblazoned them up on the front of the fiberglas?
&gt;&gt;I don't remember that term used in period....
&gt;
&gt;as far as i know, the campers were referred to as Campmobile or just Campers.
&gt;i had never heard them referred to as &quot;Westy's&quot; before this list or LiMBO.
&gt;and i've never heard a salesperson refer to them as anything but Campers.
&gt;but they were all made by Westfalia. in europe, i think they were called
&gt;Wohnmobile or Wohnwagen.
&gt;
Our '71 Westy was called just that, on a small decal stuck to the pop top 
near the outside sink vent. I think it had a prancing horse on the crest, 
possibly a joke in honour of its Ferrari like performance. VW referred to 
them as Campmobile in their literature however. I've always used 
'Westphalia', it seemed to be recognized widely for as long back as I can 
remember as the factory VW camper. Is 'Dormobile' an English generic term 
for all conversions done by Dormobile Co (?), or is it unique to VWs only ?
