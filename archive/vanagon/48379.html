Wow Gerry, I thought these cracked because someone with a screw gun tightened
the screws. Jim Davis suggested spilled brake fliud but maybe it was brake
fliud vapor????????? It seems that it is brittle and the little chunks keep
falling at my feet.My 1984 has 220K miles and the screws are fine.I thought
some kind of chemical too.Anyone else out there suffer this malady?
