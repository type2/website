Subject: yellow headlights

I just called the New Jersey Dept. of Motor Vehicles and the person
there said that all headlight lenses must be clear. Yellow lenses are
illegal. Even if you shipped a car here from Europe you must have the
lights changed to meet US specs. Too bad.... the headlights look much
better yellow :-(
