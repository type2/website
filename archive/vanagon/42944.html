 bottom], had four windows on each side (from behind the front
 doors to the end of the bus) between '63 and '67 [Between '55
 and '62, both the 'Special Model' and the 'Samba' had a fifth,
 pexi-glass window in the round of each rear panel.  This fifth
 pair of windows was brought back in a limited run of the '67
 Samba]

actually, all deluxes before the wide rear hatch (until 64) have the corner
windows.   Only the pre 3/55 buses came with plexiglas, after that they has
either laminated or tempered glass, depending on year.     67 did not have
corner windows.


 3) Ras Bulli Split has only three windows on each side as one
 would find in a Standard Kombi.  I have also discovered that
 my brick has the 1 tonne suspension (according to Bentley)
 which was supposedly a trade mark of the De Luxe, the
 Ambulance, the Fire Truck, and optional on a Panel.

if your bus has the 3 windows, maybe the plate was changed?   What do the M
codes say (ha ha hee hee maniacle laughter), they are on the plate behind the
passenger seat.

does it have a white vinyl headliner?   does it have grey panels above the
drivers head?   grey panels on the front doors?   trim on the belt line?

the 64-67 suspension is the heavier duty - not special to deluxe.   it was
also available in 62 i think, as an option.   it is irrelevant to model type.

 I went digging for some
old photos I have of a '65 Westy, I encountered at a campground in
Northern Ontario a few years back.  This fellow's awning was supported
at either end of the Bus, by a pole that appeared to clamp onto the
overriders.  In this manner you were still able to open the front
passenger door.  I do not remember how it attached to the &quot;gutter&quot;
along the edge of the roof ... I think it was a piece of 3/8 piping
with a bevelled notch cut into its entire length
- - - -
my 65 westy does not have its awning anymore (help) .   but it does have an
attachment on the front bumper by the overrider, and 4 on the roof above the
rain gutter.   the roof ones have round holes for a ?3/8' pipe to slide into.
 the bumper one holds the end of a pole.
