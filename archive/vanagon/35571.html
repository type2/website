Subject: Diesel Vanagons, or What I Learned Today.

Don't drink before buying a car.  No.  That's not it.  Oh yes:

I pulled my starter today.  To answer my own question (thanks to you people
who did respond by the way), it can be done without pulling the motor or
transaxle.  The &quot;solenoid looking thingie&quot; that I mentioned in my previous
posts turned out to be the clutch slave cylinder (surprise number one:  a
hydraulic clutch in a bus).

It's actually pretty easy to get the two starter bolts out (19mm), but the
slave cylinder bracket traps one of the starter flanges.  The rest of the
bracket goes to the base of the clutch lever on the side of the transaxle.
This gem doesn't just move out of the way for you, as there is no obvious
way to get the lever off.  There is a bolt at the base of the bracket, but
it's oriented in such a way that there is no way you are getting it out
without dropping the transaxle out first.  Not plan A to say the least.  It
would have been possible to get a socket on an extension in there from the
front, but in true VW fashion, the bolt head lies right up against the case.
Even a thin wall socket won't fit on there.

Here's the solution.  The slave cylinder has a metal fluid line leading away
from it.  It terminates at a bolt on bracket (located about where that weird
little s-shaped tube is on a &quot;regular&quot; bus) and from there you have a
flexible hose leading to the frame.  By removing this bolt and &quot;encouraging&quot;
the bracket to swivel about the clutch lever base, it will move enough for
you to fish the starter out from above (!). I waited until then to
disconnect the electrical wires, as they would have been a joke to reach
before hand.  Of course I disconnected the battery before commencing this
exercise or my lesson would have been in random arc welding without eye
protection.

The terminals came right off by the way.  I had been kindly warned that I
could fubar the back of the solenoid if it required serious tourque.  Yes,
they are potted in plastic and would break easily.  Mine came off perhaps a
little too easy, and the contacts were dirty.  Having gotten this far
however, I was not about to reverse the process without having someone
&quot;freshen&quot; up the unit a little first.

Lesson #2.  What the hell?

While I was under there gazing away for the first time I noticed a tube
pointed at my face that didn't go anywhere.  Normally this is the sign of
Bozo repair and maintainance work, so I tried to figure out where it is
supposed to connect.  Let's see.  It's a ratty looking soot filled tube that
looks like part of the exhaust system, only it's coming from up front.  Now
I know the Germans liked pumping exhaust into confined spaces, but this car
doesn't use heater boxes.  There's a rather large sheet metal tub under the
van blocking a good view (looks like 20ga. sheet metal, definitely not a
skid plate.  There is a hole big enough for Fluffy to climb up in there
however, so their heart was in the right place).  The device looks like a
cross between a heater box and a catalytic converter.  It's about 3 feet
long and has wires and a fuel line.

Gadzooks!  A gas, I mean diesel, heater?  Can it be?  I guess the heater
core wasn't invented until 1984?  Does anyone have any advice about care and
feeding?  The PO told me the heater worked but that the heater fan was
toast.  Real shocker, I know.

Anyway.  A place downtown is overhauling my starter 5 year warranty, $99
bucks using my starter.  We'll see.

While gazing a little more at the wonderous curve balls they threw me on
this one (my  sixth VW) I noticed the rear swing arm.  Does the CV joint
actually pass THROUGH this unit on all vanagons?  What a hoot.  How the hell
am I supposed to inspect CV boots without X-ray vision?
