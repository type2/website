&lt;&lt;  I am looking for an occasional spare seat (in other words removeable).  I
 am hoping to get a rear facing seat(s) that would go back to back with the
 front seats.    I have checked with several other enthusiasts who have told
 me about the factory 5th seat but I feel there are more options. &gt;&gt;

get a rear facing removeable jumpseat out of a '87 up wolfs ed or carat 7
pass, or out of a '90 - '91 multivan.

grey velour.
easier to take out than the 3rd westy swivel seat, and easier to find.
