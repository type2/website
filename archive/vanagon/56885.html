        The father of my voice professor from college has a Rialta.  I
found it quite spacious and not lacking in capabilities.  He said that
it cruises at 70, gets 20 miles to the gallon and handles his family of
5 people with no problem.  He bought it as a retirement travelling home
and spends 6 months a year in the thing.  The pull out shower/head room
is a great use of space.  The galley area has a microwave, 2-burner
stove, and a double bowl sink.  Two people can sleep in the back
table/fold down bed.  The optional front bucket or fold out bed seating
is great for long trips (I imagine), probably better than the passengers
bouncing on the back bench seat of a Westy.  Air-conditioning,
water-heater...all the comfort of home.
        Here is the problem....If you are over 5'10&quot; you will not be
happy in the Rialta.  None of the beds are over 6' long.  I (at 6'3&quot;)
was uncomfortble just standing stooped shouldered in the thing, and
there would be know way for me to get a good night of sleep in it. 
Thank God for the Westy conversion sleeping and headroom space.

        I won't even talk about the $73,000 the guy paid for it.  I'd
rather buy 6 more Syncros...one for each day of the week.
