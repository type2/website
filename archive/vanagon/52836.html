Subject: compression ???

hi all 

yet another question 

i wrote and said i had compression of 120-121-147-165 per cylinder is this
much to be worried about. one person answered just keep driving and another
said something else

my question is the bentley manual said it should not be under 120psi. which
i dont have far to go. the bus doesnt leak antifreeze except a small leak
from the rear passanger heater(i still need to mess with that later).  it
also doent burn oil which to me indicates good rings.  it has 165k on the
motor and is very clean. ive only owned it for 3 months and this is my 1st
water cooled opposing flat four. the bus came form out west and has no rust.
the owner is a college student and has no cash, so had to sell.  i picked up
this gold colored 86 for 1400.00 and had to replace the front spindle and
disc. ive also aquired a spare motor for 100.00 that i pick up next weekend
for parts. im told the motor ran two years ago before the van was totaled.   

this vehicle will be used for hauling vw parts to vw shows in the summer. so
if there is anything that must be done, i will take care of it this winter
but i hate to rebuild a motor that may only need one head reuilt and or
swaped out.
thanks jonce
