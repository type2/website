Subject: Steaming Syncro!

     Not mine, fortunately!

     Commutes in DC are rough these days, most roads plowed (if you are
     lucky) to one lane only, overall I estimate about one third of traffic
     lanes are available. Net result: massive tie-ups.

     I've occasionally seen a blue syncro gl on my route. He happened
     to be in front of me today, and after turning a corner, he/we
     saw a massive jam ahead. He then headed into a residential
     neighborhood, unplowed but with little traffic. I decided to follow.

     He had a pretty good alternative worked out, though he seemed
     to be more and more in a huff to discover that he could not
     shake me, running through some snow windrows that would have
     discouraged a non-syncro ( I presume).

     Anyway, at a stop light I saw steam coming out of his left rear air
     intake grill, at window level. Is this normal, or perhaps a
     sign of the dreaded head gasket disease?
