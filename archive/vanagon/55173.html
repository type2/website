Subject: Fwd: Vanagon Engine Alternatives

The price of the kit is $1500.  That does not include the engine, wiring
harness or fuel injection computer.   Prices they had paid for the latter
ranged from $350 to $1000.  Should be able to do the conversion for less than
the cost of a dealer installed motor ($3000).  I have a catalog coming that
should tell more.

&gt;&gt;I had the opportunity to drive the Subaru conversion about 4 months ago.  I
&gt;visted Kennedy Eng. and they were nice enough to allow me to drive their
&gt;test bed.  I can say they have done a first class job in the conversion.  As
&gt;far as power, this van has lots of guts in will take mountain roads with
&gt;plenty of power!  If we were all honest about it, VW didn't do their
&gt;homework in making the waterboxer engine.  The Sabura engine is a product of
&gt;the late 80's and runs circles around the VW engine.  I love the concept of
&gt;the Vanagon and I say anything that will improve its reliability is worth a
&gt;look at.
