Subject: 

This time tomorrow, we'll be on the road, heading for Inuvik and 
points in-between, in company with another van from the Toronto area.
We've got nearly two months of fun and frolic, so it's Sayonara for 
now, fellow list-members, and time to unsubscribe.

Have a great summer, all, and for those of you heading to Inuvik, 
hope to meet up with you along the way.  Safe journey.
