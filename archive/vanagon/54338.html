Hey Vanatics,

A sincere thanks to everyone on the list for all of the advice and the 
virtual community, it's been fun.  I'll be off for some time until I'm able 
to find a new e-mail server.

The outsourcing and downsizing bandit has struck my company, closing a 
department.  Ah, the fun of corporate life!!!

Anyone who has info to share from one of my previous postings, you can try 
to forward it to:  holmdahl_at_augsburg_dot_edu.  Hopefully I can make that account 
work correctly.

Regards,

Paul
