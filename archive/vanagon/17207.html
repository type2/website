&gt;??? you should have 16 gallons like the rest of us. i get only about 20 mpg
&gt;but i can go for 300-310 miles on the 16 gallons before getting really
&gt;really nervous (usually, i fill up at 250-280 miles).

Ever wonder why VW never redesigned the gas tank after they went to water
cooled? Look and you'll note a large pass through in the top of the
tank. It allows the heater hose access to the front. Heh, it could have
added another gallon or two!
