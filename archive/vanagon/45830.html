Subject: Eurovan Door gasket falling apart _at_#!&amp;*!
Date: Wed, 03 Jul 1996 17:07:22 GMT

My driver's side door gasket on my 93 EV has separated at
the top of the door opening.  From looking at it, it appears
to be two pieces -- an inner and outer piece -- glued
together to make one assembly.  The outer piece is very
stretchy and is glued to the inner piece in a stretched
mode, making it very difficult for me to reglue it, since it
has come unglued across the entire top.  My initial effrts
with  Permatex weatehrstrip glue was unsuccessful, as within
a day, it came undone.  I'm about to try the real thing --
3M Weatherstrip glue -- but thought I'd ask if anyone esle
has had the same problem and has a better idea (other than
removing the entire door gasket!)
