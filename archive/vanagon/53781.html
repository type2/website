&gt; IMHO Pressure, applied gently but persistently is the most productive
&gt; method. In our case it was a 6 year old 1986 Subaru with only 13,000
&gt; kms. They wanted to write the car off; we wanted it repaired. What we
&gt; did was challenge the insurance company to locate such a low millage car
&gt; for sale anywhere in Canada. We were fairly confident that it was an
&gt; impossible task. Nobody sells such a gem. For the repair costs they went
&gt; from $2,400 to $4,500 to $6,500 finally (more than the book value at
&gt; that time). The war took over three months of sparring. It helped that
&gt; the car was my mother's (little old lady) and her son was championing
&gt; her cause (justice for our elderly). I milked this injustice bit for all
&gt; of its political juice. It also helped that car insurance companies were
&gt; going through a rough time in the press. There was more than a hint that
&gt; I would go to the press it they didn't do-the-right-thing.
&gt; 
&gt; The three most important tactics to follow are: pressure, presistance,
&gt; and stand on firm ground.
&gt; 
&gt; Get all the adds you can find for similar year/model/condition and get
&gt; the asking prices. Get as much info you can for real live vans (not
&gt; stats orbook values). If the company is going to give you what you want,
&gt; they must be given some way to save face.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish you very good luck,
