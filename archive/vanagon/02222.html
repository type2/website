Subject: trip logistics


I guess we have to figure out exactly what we want for this trip at some point

If we go with an agenda (which being a free country people can choose to
ignore in part/whole) i think the first item of business is to propose a 
maximum miles per day figure. If we stay at about 400 miles/day, if someone
wants to do a side trip and then catch up they wont end up dead doing it.
Maybe break each day into at least two legs (more if there's more to see)
with a destination in mind for a late dinner time - then sing/dance/sleep
as you fancy.

Thelast time i did this was eight years ago (Ithaca NY to LA via south, up
West coast and across the plains and midwest back home) i remember 12
hours a day driving got very old day after day....

More babbling - if we want to stuck togethr, i think bricks (thx steve) will
need to drink first, followed by loafs and owls. With at least two legs a day
there is a natural drinking time so that would keep us together. (Diesel
bricks cruise all day on a single tank just to wet my whistle  btw)

I would write more logistics stuff but martha will smash my fragile
psyche with more posts about &quot;cutting the knots out of wood so they dont
stare at you ...&quot; (no i dont, i paint closed eyelids on them)

or &quot; keeping you dustbuster in a cosy&quot; (Plaid, matching the remote)

thats anal-retentive obsessive-compulsive with HYPHENS !!

:-D
