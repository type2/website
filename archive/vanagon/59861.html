Subject: Running rich and flooding

     Arggg.  My 84 just started running rich and flooding in a horrible 
way.  I wasn't really worried at first, as it just showed up as bad hot 
starting, but in the last few days it evolved into a lack of power and 
damn near impossible hot starting.

     I won't be able to get under it for a few days so I'm taking time to 
gauge the wisdom of the list.

     Thanks,
