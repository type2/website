Subject: Re: Hookup for vacuum advance

&gt;I have a 34PICT3 carb and 009 distributor. I want to trade out for the 
&gt;vacuum advanced distributor that was intended for the '71/34pict setup. 
&gt;Can someone please inform me regarding the setup for the vacuum lines? 
&gt;There are four vacuum (two with tubes; two without) outlets on the carb and 
&gt;only one on the distributor. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe
&gt;
&gt;I swapped my 009 for a stock dist. on my 71 bus.  On my dist. there are
 two vacuum connects on the round can.  One points towards you as you face
 the engine and the other points toward the fan housing.  The one that 
 points towards you is connected to the carb on the left side next to the 
 large idle screw.  The other line goes to connection on the carb that faces
 you and is about level/even with the middle of the return spring.

 Hope that helps.
 Martin
