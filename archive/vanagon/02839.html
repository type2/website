Subject: Re: Syncro off road?

&gt; I'm wondering if it's worth looking for a Syncro.  Are they

&gt;any good off road, 

Almost as good as any other stock 4x4 on the market...

&gt;or is the 4wd just for poor traction conditions on 
&gt;?pavement?  

No, it is excellent off road in the worst of conditions.

&gt;Are they especially troublesome?  

Ummm....Somewhat.

Are parts a problem?

Ummm...Pretty much.
