Subject: Vanagon Handling Advice?
Date: Thu, 9 Jan 97 17:36:09 PST

Due to our home in the Santa Cruz Mountains and work/shopping in the &quot;flats&quot;
of Silicon Valley, the old vanagon gets a lot of mountain road work.  I would
like to improve handling, especially roll in corners.  My knee-jerk plan is
to add KYB gas shocks and some stabilizer bars.  Also plan on adding wider
Mercedes or Audi wheels with lower profile tires.  I bet you all have some
better ideas, and I'd love to hear them.  I'm not on the list, so email me
directly for best results.  Thanks a bunch.
