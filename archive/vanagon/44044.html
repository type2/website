Subject: Found a Binz Crewcab


While coming back from Buses on the Blue Ridge I took the opportunity 
to follow up on a lead on a Binz crewcab.  A friend found the bus out 
in the middle on nowhere in the NC mountains where it has been parked 
for the past 20 years.  Neighbors gave the name of a relative.  Relative 
said owner lives in Florida now and was generally uncooperative.  I 
need to do more detective work to get the owners name to rescue this 
rare gem.  I believe there were only 900 made worldwide.

I didn't get a chance to look at the vin # because wasps poured out 
when I opened the passenger door.  There was also a wasp nest in the 
engine compartment, so I couldn't look there either.  My guess is it 
is a '57 or '58.  I was brave enough to stick my head in the rear 
suicide door to get a picture of the Binz emblem on the back of the 
wall behind the passenger seat.

Later this summer I will go back for more info.  It is not going 
anywhere because it has no tranny in it and has a post supporting 
the dilapidated roof of the barn resting in the bed.
