&gt;&gt; new guides.  And install stem seals, although the engine will get you to

&gt;  You're not joking about the valve guides. I've got two 2000cc type IVs
&gt;  and both came to me in need of a rebuild because at least half a valve
&gt;  guide had been bounced around the head. The piston crown in each case 
&gt;  looked like a relief map of the Himalaya's and in one engine the bits had 
&gt;  managed to make their way into the ajoining cylinder too. I don't know 
&gt;  why this engine seems partial to doing this, but checking them during a 
&gt;  rebuild may stop an expensive crunch later.

It's the heat.  Also, when the guides are replaced, the head is usually
damaged.  If the guides can be pressed in without heating the head, the head
should be machiined and fitted with oversize guides.  This applies to all air
cooled engines.
