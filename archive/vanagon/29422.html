&gt; Guess I'll need to refer to my '71 loaf, with its questionable 1600
&gt; engine, as &quot;motivationally challenged&quot;?
&gt; Heater doesn't work, either... &quot;climactically challenged&quot;?
&gt; Steering's pretty loose, too... &quot;directionally unimpaired&quot;?
&gt; Some rock dings in the windshield... &quot;panoramically compromised&quot;?&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else?

how about if we refer to those who have a problem with &quot;the PC BS&quot; as 
&quot;compassion compromised&quot;?
