Subject: Part numbers for '71 bus
Date: Thu, 4 Jan 1996 14:08:13 -0600 (CST)

I have a question about getting the correct part numbers for my '71 
bus.  So far I have been buying big things like motors or small things
from someone like RMMW.  They have their own parts numbering system.  
Now I find myself in the market for things like rotors that are two 
year only.  The part number becomes more important when I start 
calling people without fancy catalogs and the like.  So, the long and 
short of it is:  where can I find a parts number listing for my bus?  
Do the dealers really give away the old fiche?  Here in the rust belt 
they just look at me funny when I start asking for parts.  I doubt I 
could get friendly enough with them to get them to fork over their 
fiche.  Thanks, Jim
