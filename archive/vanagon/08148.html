Subject:       Re: i realy like the people in this list

To Ray and All--
First of all, I wish you Best Fortune in your family, Ray.

secondly, there is something unique about this group.  Yes, the noise 
factor gets high at times and I'm as guilty as anyone.  However, I 
also belonged to another list that was vile and back-stabbing.  A 
continual show of knowledge and eliticism.  I left that one, although 
there was good info, because of the aggresive atmosphere.  

Maybe it's that we've all stood the trial by fire in owning and 
loving our vans.  Maybe we're all a bunch of dried up flower 
children.  Maybe the cosmos just came together and we happened.  I 
dunno.  Whatever we are, I appreciate the people and supportive 
atmosphere too.
