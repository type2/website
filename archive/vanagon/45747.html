A boring but not insurmountable problem.  Buy several 4 ft weather ballons 
and a roll of baling wire, second only to duct tape in its universality of 
use. Then visit the local rent-a-centre and get a large tank of helium.  
Getting the picture ;&gt;.  Assemble about 4-6 pyro-erotic devices on a good 
length of baling wire (the reason for ' a good length' will be made apparent 
soon) for each balloon. Wire them on well, about  a foot apart each. Slip 
the end of each wire through the biggest pinwheel you can find and add a 
washer then wind up the wire so the pinwheel spins freely. Attach to the 
balloon well. You're all set, now find a place with a large field of view, 
but difficult access and preferably many exits. Stay away from airports 
kids!!  Check the local weather reports, particularly wind direction and 
speed, the need for this will also be made apparent.  

If you are quick and coordinated you can light all six fuses and release 
your cargo of death before the first roman candle blows by your face, the 
second time we did this we used cigarettes as fuses!! =:O   Just tape the 
fireworks fuse gently onto the cig. Then light the cigs and release the balloon.

Now, why the wind direction and a good length of wire. wellll.. the second 
time we did this the roman candles were a bit loose, and the wind was 
blowing from the park we were in, directly towards a housing development 
(tightly packed rowhouse quads with central parking court ;&gt; )
        The wind alone wasn't the problem, nor was the sloppy wiring, but 
togther...  The first balloon got to treetop height and lit out horizontally 
at 30 knots, and the roman candles began blasting while we raved. The top 
candle shot its first ball out horizontally, a great show maybe 200 feet up, 
pinwheel leaving behind a monstrous shower of sparks looking like a giant 
Portugese Man-'o War. 
        We were thrilled! Our monster roared again and again, but each time 
the top candle tilted a bit more vertically. After about 4 balls the candle 
pointed into the balloon and the next shot was fatal.  By this time the 
ballon had arrived over the housing site, and it abruptly descended like 
some demon, spewing fire and thunder.  We watched in awe as it dropped 
behind the roof of the houses, bright flashes lit up the rooflines, lights 
came one all over the place, we heard a scream. Great coils of fireworks 
smoke rolled up to the roofs from inside the parking area, adding even more 
to colourful ambience of the evening. Truly a 'Son et Lumiere' to remember, 
for us and the occupants.

as I said, pick an isolated launch area with many exits.
