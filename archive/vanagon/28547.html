&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; SET DEVICE=EXXON to screw up your environment.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As long as we depend on oil, we are _guaranteeing_ ourselves oil spills.
&gt;&gt;Which company pulled the latest one, is almost immaterial.
&gt;&gt; (Snip)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, sorry-- that got me going. I'll shut up now...

&gt;
&gt;Whew!  Had me worried - just remembered I'd been pulling up to the EXXON
&gt;pump for the last year cause I like their automated debit card device.
&gt;Seems to me I remember Greenpeace dogging Shell for wanting to dump a used
&gt;oil derrick in the sea.  So, I guess there's no use trying to blame one
&gt;company.
&gt;
&gt;Like the current threads much better, 'cept maybe the 'old fart&quot; crack -
&gt;Good thing Joel's one, too.  !)
