Subject: '79 bus alternator help please!
Date: Sun, 19 Nov 95 20:32:41 CST


OK, my dad hooked up the battery backwards on his '79 Bus and smoked 
the alternator.  I want to replace it for him over thanksgiving break.
Couple of questions:

1) The FLAPS guys have me all confused.  I get questions like &quot;internal
   or external voltage regulator?&quot; and &quot;Bosh or Motorola&quot;.  What do I 
   need to get?

2) Is anything else likely to get blow by a reversed battery (ignition off).

3) What tools will I need to take to Kansas to do the job?

Hope somebody can help at least on number one.

Thanks,

Albrecht
