Hey!  What was the problem with the weather?!?  We've been having exactly 
the same sort of weather here for a month non-stop (got mud for tap water 
to prove it, ever since we've had a series of mud slides in 2 of our 3 
water reservoirs), so it's all the same to me.  Mentioned the reunion to 
Christa this morning after hearing the idea from martha, and she would 
really like to go.  

I think that (for once) the saner part of my head (yes, there is sanity 
in there somewhere... I think) should prevail, so I think a 2,000 mile 
weekend camping trip is kinda out.  Unless we change our minds (or 
totally blow them) of course.    ;-)~

I assume somebody will bring Bob along, so say a big &quot;hi&quot; for me. *:-)~

Should we mail down some prunes?
