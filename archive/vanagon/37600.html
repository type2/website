Subject:       RE: re 'so much love'+dysfunctional emotional attachment...

&gt; &gt;Sounds to me like a typical marriage....but then again, most people don't
&gt; &gt;marry their vehicles, do they?
&gt; 
&gt; Most don't. But, then, those that do, usually wind up joining mailing lists
&gt; for the cars, too.   :^)

Grin.

So Steve, are you expecting any off-spring?  Say a Bug with a 
Chevette Engine?!
