&gt;Hey VW people,
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if anyone out there has ever delt with the parts company 
&gt;known as MOFOCO. I am looking for a rebuild kit for my 1974 Westy and 
&gt;this is the only company I could find that sells a complete kit for an 
&gt;1800CC engine. The kit includes reconditioned crank, Main, Rod and Cam 
&gt;bearings, reconditiond rods, reground cam, reground lifters, flywheel 
&gt;seal, piston and barrell set, geasket set, and push rod tubes. The price 
&gt;on the kit is $409.95. This sound like alot for a little to me. If anyone 
&gt;has any info of other suggestions for me, the help would be greatly 
&gt;appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Hi Woody,

My experience has not been the best, but maybe you get what you pay for.  In
my case I bought a complete front beam from spindle to spindle.  I
specifically asked for '69 or later bug beam.  The beam I received had
mismatched spindles with the drivers side being the older smaller race.  The
axle grease seals were cracked and the ball joints were the non-greasable
style (cheap, good for 20,000miles.)  When I disassembled the beam to give a
closer look, one of the torsion springs leafs was missing and the trailing
arms had a significant amount of blasting sand in them.  I thought I had
paid enough to not have to put up with this level of quality. 

In your case, look for misgapped rings, cheap seals, mismatched piston and
rod weights.  I have heard that a cam cannot be reground on a VW aircooled,
but this is not from my experience.  The word is that the cam and lifters
must wear in together in order to last.

Buyer beware.  Be careful.

Bob
