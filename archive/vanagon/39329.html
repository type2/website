Subject: Parting out '79 Kombi

As I stated in my earlier post, I am flopping engines from a '79 Kombi to a
'73 Westy. This will leave me with most of a '79 Kombi that will be towed
off to the compactor.  Before it goes, I would like a &quot;strip list&quot; from any
of you in need of parts.  The lower body and floors are dead (metasticized
rust cancer), but all the glass (except the windshield {I'm keeping that})
and the rear upper door are good and free for the asking as is any thing
else I don't need.  Ask if you want it and I will do my best to remove it
before the van goes.  The only limit is you must arrange for pick-up/shipping.
