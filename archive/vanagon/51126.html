Only the later ones (S and S4) have the 4 valve heads, and I'm not
sure the S models did.  Essentially the 928 is two 944 blocks shoehorned
together with heads to match origionally back in '78?.  It has little
to nothing in common with the pitiful 924 Audi based mill as far as
I know.

928's are beautiful and somewhat affordable cars now days as they
age, one of the worlds finest GT's, but engine rebuilds are prohibitive.
