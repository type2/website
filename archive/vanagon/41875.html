sorry about that.  I was, to some extent, talking about VWs, though i didn't
mention the actual name.  i suppose i feel that is one of the great things
about Volkswagens.      I get a kick when someone asks my gas milage, and it
is lower than their much newer car.   Old VWs, to me, are not just a toy or
2nd car, but my primary transportation.   (until I get back on my bike this
summer)   In good shape, they are reliable and economical.   And just think
of all the new car production i havent supported.   I hope to keep driving
old vws till im an old lady.    (the forever VW)   I though it was so cool
when i saw a nice shiny black rag top oval in Grants Pass, and was told it
was owned and driven by a little old lady who had had it for years.   Bet it
got better than 30mpg.    Maybe I'm just rationalising my infatuation with
old buses.  

We must save them!
