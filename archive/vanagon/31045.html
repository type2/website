Subject: Re: Coolant disappearing

In a message dated 95-12-16 19:03:12 EST, you write:

&gt;My neighbour has a 1990 Westy (same as mine).  His coolant keeps
&gt;disappearing.
&gt;No leaks on the floor and he could not find any around the engine.  He
&gt;replaced
&gt;the water pump with a new one.  Since then, has lost about a liter more.
&gt;Would
&gt;appreciate any help.

My '88 Vanagon GL (used to be known as &quot;Thirsty&quot;) had a similar problem,
leaking about a half cup of coolant every week or so.  Neither I nor two
dealers, nor an independant mechanic could find the source of the leak.
 However, after having the engine pulled (by the independant that couldn't
find the leak) for a clutch replacement, the leak stopped completely.  My
guess is that there was a hose connection somewhere that, under pressure,
would dribble out a minute amount of coolant, that would later evaporate
before it could accumulate enough to drip.  The mech couldn't find any traces
of this, but he sure didn't replace any head gaskets for free!

So, have your neighbor/friend check all hose connections and tighten (not a
bad idea to do regularly, anyway).

Good luck!
