Subject: Locking and unlocking Little Martha

	Separate problem, separate posting, for '70 Crew Cab. I've
posted this problem before, and though I recieved several suggestions,
none Since my driver's side door inner pannel is still loose, I'm
steeling myself for one more run at the figuring out the door locks.

I can lock and unlock both doors from the inside or outside. 
I can operate the latches from inside or outside. 

HOWEVER, if I LOCK the door and *then* PULL on the outside release trigger, 
I can no longer unlock it from outside! Specificly, I can't get the lock 
cylinder to rotate in the unlock direction, and rotating in the lock 
direction has no effect.

	It can still be unlocked and unlatched from inside, luckily.

	This is not a lubricaton problem as far as I can tell. The
cylinder rotates freely at other times, and the passenger side lock
was cleaned and re-lubricated with no change apparent.

	The locks and door handles I've got are recent Brazilian-made
but the latch release part appears identical to the driver's side handle
that came with the truck.

	I'm going to pull the driver's side lock mechanism and clean
and relubricate it. I'm then going to bend-out the contact point on
the arm that the outside release presses on. That's the only relevant
adjustment I can see. Doing this improved, though did not fix, the
passenger side. If I can't make it work that way, I give up.

	Then I'll start calling body shops and see if there
is someone who claims to know how to do this. When my brother was
fitting felt channels in his Beetle, he couldn't get it right and when
he asked the guy at Bugformance, the Bugformance guy said words to the
effect of &quot;I can't do that either, I take it to such-and-such body
shop and they charge $50 to do it.&quot; In the end, that may be what
I have to do.

	Thanks again
