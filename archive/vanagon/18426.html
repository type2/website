To All:

Not sure if this will ge germain to Westy-specific propane problems...

I use a sausage-shaped 3-gal and the regular 5-gal jug on my '65 when fitted
out for camping.  The tanks are demountable.  I mounted the pressure
reducer/regulator permanently, provided it with a high-pressure hose that
will mate  to either tank.  Low pressure output is plumbed here and there
using 3/8&quot; dia aluminum tubing, the dead-soft stuff (3003).  All fittings
down-stream from the regulator are SAE flare or standard flared plumbing
items.

I use a variety of adaptors to charge little propane cylinders (torch,
lantern, etc) from the big bottle.  Other adaptors allow any bottle to be
used with any of the lanterns, stoves, etc.  The adaptors were acquired over
the years but I assume a propane supplier would be a good place to find them.
 

At least one of the adaptors is unique to Mexico (but quite common there).
 It allows me to 'borrow' a bit of propane from a farm tank.

Propane dictates a strict set of safety rules that are self-enforcing -- your
first mistake is usually your last.

Filling a bottle with propane is a bit of a shock if you've never done it
before, what with the noise, frost and plume of vapor.  To keep from freezing
a finger it might be best to have someone walk you through the procedure.

Propane makes an excellent vehicle fuel.  If it is commonly available in your
area at a resonable cost, you may wish to consider using it.  But it's a bit
of a chore to use such a vehicle for long trips since pound for pound propane
contains less energy than gasoline.  VOA's industrial engine division (usta
be in Chicago) offered a full range of pressure reducers, etc, needed to
operate air-cooled VW engines from gasseous fuels.
