 &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;OK, what does NFA 4295 stand for?   &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; So, was anyone there?   Was it really good, or what?  Was this a Bird
 &gt; Song/Help on the Way/Loose Lucy type show?

4/2/95 was at the Pyramid Arena in Memphis TN.  Interestingly, Not Fade Away
was not played.  The first set was
	Shakedown Street
	The Same Thing
	Althea
	Memphis Blues Again  (of COURSE...)
	Tennessee Jed (and this one HAD to be in here..)
	Promised Land
and the second was 
	Here Comes Sunshine -&gt;
	Eternity -&gt;
	Crazy Fingers -&gt;
	Estimated Prophet -&gt;
	Drums -&gt;
	Space -&gt;
	The Last Time -&gt;
	Wharf Rat -&gt;
	Not Fade Away

Now, the REALLY EXCITING part of the show (at least for deadheads) was that 
the encore was Unbroken Chain, NEVER performed live until the '95 spring tour.
The first playing of Unbroken Chain was 19 March 1995 -- exactly one
year ago today.
