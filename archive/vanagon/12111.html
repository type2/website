Subject: One Speed Wiper Switch in 78 Westy?

My van only has the first wiper speed,  when  I flick  the switch up to the
second speed the wipers just stop wherever they're at. Are the contacts
in  the switch hooped? Anyone  have  this  problem  before? Would
appreciate  any help from  someone who's run into this before.
Regards,
C.
