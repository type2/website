Subject:  another exhaust manifold question

took the thing off last night and brought it to a shop this morning.  it is
stainless, and they can weld it no problem, although they commented on
how the first guy really 'goobered' it :-).  the question i have now is about
the heat shield (i don't know if that's what it's actually called, but its the
thin metal wrapping around the manifold).  to try to weld the manifold, the
first guy cut this wrapping off, and it is now in useless condition.  do i
need to worry about this?  the closest thing which i could fry is the oil
filter, i think (anything else?).  i can have the shop fabricate a shield for
some $, but only on the straight part of the pipe. so - any suggestions? 
does the shield do that much?  thanks in advance.

p.s. - i also noticed the little rubber boot where the shift linkage meets the
trans is completely shot.  what's the name of this piece so i can get a
new one?
