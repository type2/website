Subject: Re: Propane Fridge Blowing Out

I aggree, the fridge shouldn't go out whilst driving.
I had a problem installing my fridge exhaust correctley.
Basically my bus was a twin sliding door, so there was no
fixed side to put the exhaust vent through. I had to rig
up some pipe work to exhaust the fumes. I found that heavy
air tubulance around the exhaust would blow the flame out
quite easily.

Also I ran mine on Butane at first, but that was crap. There
was not enough gas pressure keep the thing working. Propane
is much hotter and has a higher bottle pressure.
