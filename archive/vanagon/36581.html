Subject: No longer a wannabus -- Was: Newbie needs advice

Thanks to all who responded to my posting about the '89 Westie 4-speed with 
222,000 kms.  I decided to pass on this one and a couple of days later, I 
found an immaculate '89 Westie (alas, automatic) with 82,000 kms.  The folks 
at Owasco VW in Whitby Ontario will have it ready for me next Monday. 
 Success after 3 1/2 years of looking for the right Westie.

So whoever handles the weekly stats should change one wannabus to and '89.
