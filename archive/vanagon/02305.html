A while back Frank Condelli went through this all on the Canadian side of 
the border. His muffler was to be $49.95 (yes!) + $15.00(?) for the 
tailpipe. The muffler came with a 1yr. warantty if D-I-Y, or lifetime if 
Canadian Tire Corp. installed it. What year vanagon etc.? I am more than 
willing to send you one just to screw VW corp. I've paid $135.00 for an '85 
H2O muffler from Midas by the way, so don't use the dealer. These are CDN 
dollar prices, so knock off ~30% for US funds. Shall I send 2 mufflers, or 
more?    tim s.
