&gt;        Concerning the A/C and its relationship to fan speed in an E-Van.
        
I don't know about the fan, other than it runs on after I stop sometimes (and
often in this summer weather.)

&gt;       Concerning your gauge, 3/4 bothers me as ours has never been 
&gt;       higher than 1/2 or a little bit above it even when traveling 
&gt;       through the Smokey Mtns.  There is always the possibility that 
&gt;       our gauge is defective and yours is accurate. More input from 
&gt;       others on the list may be needed.  Temps have been high 90's to 
&gt;       low 100's this week (I checked coolant level and strength) but 
&gt;       the needle on the temp gauge has climbed very little.  Generally, 
&gt;       our gauge reads right at or a little above the 1/2 way mark.
        
Same here.  The gauge will sometime creep over the 1/2 mark, but that's the
max.  It's usally just below, even with the A/C cranked in this summer
weather.
