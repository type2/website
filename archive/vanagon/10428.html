Subject: FS (or?): '66 VW Bus

I have a '66 Bus sitting at a friend's farm outside (Davis) Sacromento, CA.
I DROVE it there3-1/2 years ago.  I'm going to go to CA in three weeks and
plan to Junk the car UNLESS someone shows some interest in it.  As I recall
the particulars are:

     Body:  split front window (13 total, all intact), swing-out doors, body
                fair to good, new headliner, removable roof-rack

     Engine:  1600cc dual port with 34-PICT(?), RVEECO external cooler with
                   tapped case and filter, 6-V system w/ dipstick oil temp
                   sensor, Bosch 009 straight mechcanical dist.

     Spare Parts:  1600cc heads(complete) with single port intake manifold,
                           Holley Bug-Spray carb with intake manifold,
                           high-ratio rocker arms,  complete short block w/
                           12-volt flywheel (case needs work), 6-V generator,
                           pair steering knuckle/king-pin/stub axles,  misc.
                           old cylinders, oil coolers ,etc.

The bus used to run.  The only two problems I can remember, excluding the
problems associated with a 6-V system, is that the transaxle leaks (it has for
years, I just kept it filled up), and that the front end needs some work (very
squirrelly as I recall).  I'd like to get some money for my old bus,  my
friend deserves a real nice present for staring at it all these years.  If
anyone is interested in the bus or the spare junk please e-mail me in the next
three weeks (up to 2/10) and maybe we can work something out.
