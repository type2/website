Hi Everyone.  I wrote an email to Yokohama about the Y370 LT tires 
that I rave on about for the VW vans.  In response to many on the 
list that have said that Y370 is no longer made, etc, this email 
which I just received answers this question with little humour! 
:)

Hope this info helps.
Harry.

Thank you for your interest in Yokohama Tires.  We appreciate you taking 
time to write to us.  With regards to your inquiry:

I have received e-mails from the Corvette Owners Club, Club NS-X, the 
DeLorean Owners Club, Land Cruiser Off-Road Club; heck, I got an e-mail 
once from the Austin Mini Cooper Club.  

I never, in my wildest dreams, thought I would hear from a group of 
Vanagon owners.  But, I'm happy you wrote, and pleased to hear of your 
satisfaction with our Y370 tires.  

Well, rest assured.  The Y370s are still being sold and because they are 
being offered in 16 different sizes, I can't see them being discontinued 
any times soon.  

As far as why they are not listed in our web site:  that's a good 
question.  No ones actually ever written to us to ask.  Actually, because 
of Yokohama enthusiast tend to be speed demons who wish they drove for 
our IMSA team (or whatever that series is called now), the focus has been 
on our motorsports activities and performance tires.  But in light of 
your comments, I will suggest to our webmaster that they include the Y370 
G in our next round of updates.  

Thanks for your support of Yokohama Tires.  We appreciate your business, 
and hope our tires provide you with the strength and performance to get 
you where you need to go.  

P.S. I looked at your site.  Very cool.
