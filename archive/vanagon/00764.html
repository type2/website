Subject:  Vehicle does not start, ignition miss

If the engine does not start or in case of ignition related engine miss,
check the ignition coil for bitumen leakage.  Bitumen leakage may be
caused by overheating of the ignition coil which may occur when the
engine runs for a prolonged period of time at idle.

Replace the standard grey labeled ignition coil with green labeled coil
Part No. 211 905 115 D.  The green labeled coil was installed into
production as of 1/89.  VIN: 25HG 06 5838.
