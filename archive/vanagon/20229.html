&gt;&gt;It would have to be here, as none of my VW's are healthy enough to travel 
&gt;&gt;far.  And if I drove the Chrysler Sh_t-Box ('92 Grand Voyager), y'all 
&gt;&gt;would unsubscribe me. ;-)

I must admit that I would not be able to bring my bus either.  I would have
to come in my Chrysler Convertible(91 LeBaron).  If its not far I would come
on my motercycle(74 Yammha TX650) although it is a bit ill right now(oil
leaked into distributer yech).
