Subject: VW Posters

  I tried to order some of the VW posters from Rocky Mountain Motor 
Works; the ones that have all the German all over them.  They are no 
longer stocking those posters and have no more of them.  As a German 
language teacher I thought those would be excellent to have in the 
classroom.
  My obvious question is, does anyone know of another place that I could 
get those posters, or something equivalent?  Anyone on the list have them 
and be willing to part with them (for a reasonable price!)?
  Thanks for your help in advance!!
