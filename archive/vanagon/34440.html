Subject: I'm back!!!! Nice to see you all again!

     Nice to be back! Yippeee!
     
     Well, looks like my e-mail at tele-tv_dot_com is not accepting messages.
     I went to try to fix it, but the root and su passwords have changed.
     I can't complain too much..I haven't been working there for a few 
     weeks. I knew it was a matter of time before they noticed all those 
     messages coming through!!
     
     So, my new address is Thomas.W.Carrington_at_bvs_dot_com.
     
     I should mention that I am a computer systems/network consultant, and 
     my client-provided e-mail addresses change from time to time. No 
     matter what, my CompuServe address will stay active. That address is 
     72172.3371_at_compuserve_dot_com.
     
     Thanks,
     Tom Carrington
