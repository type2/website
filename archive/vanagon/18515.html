Subject: Buses on the Blue Ridge


Okay guys, you have two days to get your buses rolling.  I am leaving
Marietta Friday at 2:00pm to head up to Mt. Pisgah, NC.  Leaving from
here will be me in my 59 single cab, Allen Becker in his 58 Standard,
Tim Humphreys in his 63 crew cab, and Pete Durand in his 70 Westfalia.

Ray Hale will be meeting us here from Gainesville, FL for the trip up.
Jason &amp; Richard are already close in NC so they better have pretty 
good excuses if they don't show up.  What about Skip Correll in TN? 
Joel Walker in AL?  How about the rest of you?

If you are interested in caravaning with us, send me a note at
deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu.  If you want more info about the event 
call Neil Pickett at (704) 665-1650.

Also don't forget the Vintage VW Show at Southern Tech in Marietta
on June 25.
