Subject: Re: Redline:CV-2 High temp. CV grease

&gt; Of coarse they are Hondas not Vanagons, so time will tell, but the last CV
&gt; replaced by the PO only went 45-50K, not completly worn-out but the balls
&gt; were pitted and worn.
&gt; 
This seems a very short time for pitting to occur - I had heard 
Vanagon CVs should last 150-200K kms if well cared for. Having just 
spent Saturday doing one side on my Jetta (again, not a Vanagon, but 
closer, and with Lobro joints), I can report the following:

Both were new ~ 180k km ago, and have had NO maintenance since. Boots 
(Lobro also) were still fine - slight cracks in the outer one. Outer 
CV had minor pits on 2 out of 6 ball races. Inner appeared near new, 
and both were &quot;tight&quot;. I would expect them to go another 180k without 
trouble, which is consistent with the driver side, which were 
replaced at 360k due to cracked washer crunching around in the joint.

Anyway, having just used non-German CV grease for the first time, I'm 
wondering if I may just end up with a reduced life span also? Or 
could something else contribute to a failed CV as above in 40-50k 
miles?
