Subject: Re: Should I trash the Quaker State oil?


&gt; I recently ran up on a deal and picked up a case of  Q.S. 10W30 
&gt; Synthetic Blend for 4X4's.  I think it was 75cents a quart so I 
&gt; grabbed some up thinking, just maybe, it might be all right to use in
&gt; my Vanagon.  After the lengthy discussion 3 or 4 months ago about
&gt; oils, I tried to remember what was said about the different synthetic
&gt; blends, but don't remember the Q.S. ever being mentioned.  I have
&gt; ALWAYS used Castrol in my VW's and am willing to give this oil to my
&gt; brother for his Ranger but since this stuff is usually rather
&gt; expensive, I was hoping I could use this at my next oil change IF it
&gt; wouldn't hurt my engine.
&gt; 
You don't say what weight Castrol you've been using. If it's 10w30, 
you'll probably be fine with the QS. If you've been running 15w40 or 
20w50 Castrol, it is *very* likely you will encounter oil pressure 
problems with the 10w30, especially with a higher mileage engine.

The common view seems to be that the weight/grade of the oil 
(matched to ambient temp) is far more important than Castrol vs 
Quaker vs Pennzoil.

I for one have had problems with any 10w30 oil in several VWs, 
especially if used with a FRAM filter.
