Subject: Re: Oil leak pinpointed?



Paul,

On the Type IV both the oil filter base,and the oil cooler are bolt-ons.  The
oil filter base uses a gasket for sealing, the oil cooler a pair of grommets.
 The cooler is installed on three studs, secured with 10mm nuts.  Torque spec
for the nuts is only FIVE ft/lbs, which means it won't take much to loosen
them(!)

I can't recall if these nuts are accessable with the cooling tin installed
(I've only worked on a couple of Type IV's in vehicles).  You may have to
drop the engine and pull some tin to get at them but the symptoms you
describe make it sound as if it's time for a bit of maintenance.

As a general rule, it's a good idea to use Ny-lok nuts (like aircraft nuts;
the kind with the nylon insert) for any location where the fastener cannot be
inspected/tightened.

I'll make this a general post.  Hopefully someone with more Type IV
experience knows of a way to tighten the oil cooler without pulling the
engine.  

-Bob
