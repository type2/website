In a message dated 97-04-17 09:08:59 EDT, you write:

&gt; While driving a rented Suzuki on Phuket Island, Thailand,  I was passed by
a 
&gt; Eurovan which I later caught up with.  I noticed the tires were larger than

&gt; normal and it set diferently than other Eurovans...  It was a while before
I 
&gt; saw the &quot;Syncro&quot; emblem on the rear.  This was right hand drive etc. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I lost him in traffic, so there was no chance to see if the emblem was a 
&gt; joke or for real...
&gt;  
&gt;  Has anyone heard of a Syncro Eurovan,  or have I been in Thailand too
long???

Yep, VW makes them.  Doesn't sell them in the USA though!!
