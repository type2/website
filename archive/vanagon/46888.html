Subject: Re: fram filters

&gt; I recentley replaced the fuel filter in my 82 diesel with a Fram filter 
&gt; purchased at a FLAPS.  I was cautious about using it as it was much 
&gt; smaller than the one the PO had in it and the drain bolt was painted in 
&gt; with that blindingly bright orange paint.  I've also used the oil filters by 
&gt; Fram as they're only $3.99 locally.  At the very least the orange paint 
&gt; brightens up the drab interior of my engine compartment! ;)  Has anyone on 
&gt; the list had any bad experience using these?  I haven't had any trouble yet, but would like to avoid it!
&gt; Should I open the piggy bank and get Bosch or some other type?
&gt; Thanks

If it's smaller you got the gas filter! FRAMs are the same size as 
the stock filter. Gas is PH2870a and diesel is PH3508 I believe. 
(haven't used FRAM for a few years due to lower oil pressure with 
them). I switched to VW filters - I bought a case of 12 &amp; they cost 
about $1.50 more than FRAM.
