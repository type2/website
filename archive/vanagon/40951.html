Subject: 	Bonehead Newbie has Questions...


2.  Brake fluid reservoir (here's the Bonehead part).  Where is it?
I think that I've found everything else (washer fluid containers, fuel tank
overflow lines, coolant reservoir and expansion tank, extra battery
compartment and connectors, etc.) just not the master cylinder.  I'd really
like to make sure that I am not peilously close to a dry cylinder, and all
help will be appreciated!
