84 Vanagon running rich (15mpg) success story

Unplugged and replugged all sensors including ECU
Replaced o2 sensor with non-Bosch sensor
Cleaned grounds to engine.

Result!   20 mpg!!!!

But I'm sorry to report that the rich odor was masking out an
odor that smells a lot like coolant in the exhaust!  I'm 
conjecturing that the loss of .5 L of d  coolant in the past
1000 miles is due to a leaking gasket in the head.  When do
I have to go into rebuild mode?  ...
