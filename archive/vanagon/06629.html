So James Cook says:
&gt; 
&gt; I use a propane Olympian heater myself, but have seen another fellow in a 
&gt; Westy who carried a large clay flower pot in the van. When he wants heat, 
&gt; he puts it upside down on the burner... thus capturing that heat and it 
&gt; slowly emanates from there... more heat, longer lasting. He said it 
&gt; worked well even in snows.  This is supposedly modeled after the Indian 
&gt; idea of using clay ovens because clay captures and stores heat.

Hey James,

Martha and I have been discussing here plans to use the stove as
a heater off-line.  She's concerned about the by products of the
LP burn and how to evacuate/vent them out of the camper.  I thought
that there were no nasty by-products from burning LP gas and that
the only concern would be the replacement of oxygen.  Can you
or anyone else clarify this?

Thanks,

Steven
