                            Boot Camp

No, we're not at war, but we've definitely got a fight on our
hands when it comes to CV joints. And since you only need to do
your boots every 30,000 miles you're not likely to become
proficient at it.  So here's a little refresher course.  But
before we start, I want to preach a little pre-sermonette at you. 

When you do periodic maintenance on CV joints you must insure the
parts are not thrown out of balance.  Before taking anything
apart, make orientation marks that will allow you to reassemble
the parts in exactly the same relationship as they were
originally installed.  That includes not only the CV joints to
the stub axles and tranny, and the CV joints to the axles, but
even the balls within the CV joints; they should go back into
their same races and the same opening in the cage.  John Muir
failed to make this point in his otherwise excellent discourse on
CV joints and that failure had expensive consequences for lots of
VW owners who reassembled them in a willy-nilly fashion and even
used hose clamps and the like when installing their boots.  The
axles rotate at about a thousand rpm at freeway speed.  The
imbalance created by the screw-type clamps causes premature
failure of the rear wheel and differential bearings.  As with
pounding on the wheel nuts with a hammer &amp; chisel, this is
another instance where the earnest efforts of St. Muir did far
more harm than good.

                          Back to Boots

The boots are those rubber bellows around your axles.  Swing-arm
trannys have two of them, one on each side.  Later model 4-joint
trannys use four of them, one on each end of each axle.  (Both
early and late VW's have independent rear suspension systems. 
The term 'IRS' as applied to late-model trannys was invented by
magazine editors [who seldom get things right anyway].)

On early swing-axle trannys there is no periodic maintenance
requirement for the boots, you simply check them now and then,
replacing them if they become torn (as they all will) or leak
excessively.  On swing-axle trannys the axle runs in a housing;
the boot flexes with the rear suspension but does not rotate,
permitting the use of split-type boots as replacements.  Since
the boots serve only as an oil seal they should be replaced if
they are no longer doing their job.

On late model 4-joint trannys the boots act as grease seals for
the Constant Velocity (CV) joints and rotate with the axles.  In
order to lubricate the CV joints you must remove the boots. 
Because of the unbalanced nature of split-type boots they can not
be used as replacements, you must dismantle the CV joint and
press the axle out of the joint in order to slide the new boot
onto the axle (and the old boot off).
                          Read St. Muir

With the exception noted above, John Muir's 'Idiot' book provides
the best available step-by-step procedure for the removal,
lubrication, and replacement of your CV joints.  If you don't
hold a copy of 'How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive...' go buy one. 
Now.  (I'll wait until you get back.)  But you should also have
the Haynes VW manual (#159) which is superior to all others
thanks to its lavish use of illustrations.  They do an especially
good job describing CV joint maintenance.

                     Proper Parts and Tools

About three weeks ago you should have ordered your boot kits from
J. C. Whitney.  The catalog number is 85 xx 9433-B.  The 'xx'
changes from catalog to catalog (as does the price, which was
$8.69 in June, 1995).  A 'boot kit' consists of a replacement
boot, eight (or four, depending on model year) new bolts, a new
splined washer (needed to provide the proper pre-loading during
reassembly), a new circlip, 90 grams of CV joint lubricant, and a
new boot clamp.  J.C.Whitney's kits are from Meistersatz, the
German company that supplies VW with your original boots. 

If you've never done your boots, order four kits and do all of
your CV's.  It will provide you with a base-line for doing them
in the future.  You'll also need about twice as much lubricant
than is supplied with the kits; pick it up locally.  If some of
your old books are still in good shape, clean them and hold them
as emergency spares.  You will need to carry a spare tube of CV
lube but you can make a nicely balanced emergency boot-clamp
using wire.  (The trick is to make two wrappings, 180 degrees
apart, having the same number of twists so as to maintain proper
balance.  Use stainless steel aircraft-type safety wire if you
can get it, stainless steel MIG wire if you can't, bailing wire
as a last resort.)

Over the years Volkswagen used different numbers of bolts on
their CV joints, and different sizes, too.  The bolts are socket-
head types using EITHER Allen-head sockets or the splined 12-
point '3-squares' pattern (ie, three squares superimposed, each
rotated 30 degrees from the other).  Volkswagen has used both 6mm
and 8mm sizes.  

Since the Allen-head type may be used as replacements for the
splined type, and since the splined type came in two sizes, and
since some prior owner may have serviced one of the CV's but not
the others, one of your first chores will be to determine what
type of bolts are dealing with.  Raise the vehicle, support on
jack-stands, crawl under and scrub the heads of the CV joint
bolts clean using a toothbrush and solvent.  Be prepared to spend
up to one hour on this job.  You must clean the socket of every
bolt and there are 24 of those puppies.  If you fail to get the
sockets clean the bit won't seat properly and you'll strip the
socket, leaving you the lovely task of worrying the bolt loose
using vise-grips.  And don't assume all of the bolts are the
same!  Scrub them all; you may find one of your CV's wearing
bolts different from the others.  

Alas, Allen-head wrenches cannot be used on the 12-point splined
bolts, nor visa-versa; you'll only ruin the bolt if you try.  The
majority of Volkswagen CV joints use the 12-point splined socket
head bolts of the 8mm (socket-head) size.  J. C. Whitney sells a
four-piece set of such bits in 6, 8, 10 and 12mm for about $10
(p/n 14 xx 1662-P).  Unfortunately, the bits are American-made,
their shanks are 5/16&quot; for the two smaller sizes, 1/2&quot; for the
larger (that is, the bits will fit sockets of those sizes).  The
1/2&quot; isn't a problem; you can use it in a 13mm socket, but the
5/16&quot; size -- including the 8mm bit, the one most of us will use,
is something of a poser since it's too large to fit an 8mm
socket, too small for 9mm.  I'm lucky to have a full set of
metric and SAE sockets but if all of your tools are metric you
will have to buy a cheap set of 3/8&quot; drive SAE sockets in order
to use the 8mm bit.  The best solution is to find the bits
already mounted in sockets (they come that way) but I don't know
of a mail-order source.  Indeed, my frequent citing of
J.C.Whitney parts and tools is not from any admiration of their
quality, service or price, but only due to their global
availability.

(One word of caution:  '3-square' pattern socket head bolts used
on Volkswagens are not Torqx-bolts.  Torqx is a 2-triangle
pattern (ie, six points, rather than 12).  The typical hardware
store clerk doesn't know the difference, apparently defeated by
an number greater than five.  3-square pattern socket-head bolts
are found mostly on European vehicles, Torqx on American and
Japanese.  Brazilian vehicles use a pattern that is perfectly
round :-)

As a personal note, I've made most of the Allen-head and splined
tools I use by cutting off the bit and brazing it into a suitable
socket, usually something picked up at a swap meet.  Such bits
are made of hardened steel, they will dull a file and strip the
teeth from a hacksaw.  The proper way to cut them is to use an
abrasive cut-off wheel or a diamond saw.  Cut-off wheels work
best; the harder the material, the faster they cut.

The final tool you must have is an accurate torque wrench, and
this is one of those cases where a clicker is superior to the
torsion beam type.  Working overhead, under the vehicle, it is
very difficult to position yourself so as to read a beam-type
torque wrench without introducing parallax, whereas the clicker
can be upside-down, behind your back and in the dark, if you
wish.

Your Bentley manual fails to include the proper torque values for
the two sizes of bolt used on the CV joints.  Most of us have the
8mm bolt; they should be torqued to 25 ft/lbs, the 6mm to 31
ft/lbs.  (That's right; 25 for the 8mm, 31 for the 6mm.)  Run
them up snug, then torque in a cross-pattern for the 6mm, a star
for the 8mm (If you've got the 6mm bolts there should be only
four of them.) 

                      Hydraulics vs Hammers

The Bentley manual shows uniformed Volkswagen mechanics using the
standard-issue Volkswagen hydraulic press to push the axle out of
the CV joint (and pressing the CV back onto the axle when the job
is done, no doubt marching in lock-step between times).  St. Muir
sez use hydraulics if you got'em but a hammer will work too.  In
this case, I agree with him.  

The Haynes manual shows the mechanic pushing the axle out of the
CV joint with his thumbs.  This is the most likely case for
disassembly since the axle is meant to be a tight sliding fit in
the CV joint, rather than an interference-fit.  If you encounter
a sticky one, inspect the upper-most portion of the splines
(above the groove for the locking ring).  It's most likely that
you will find some minor burrs on these splines.  Stone them away
and try again.  If you must use hammers and drifts, use proper
ones; lead or brass for the hammers, bronze or brass for the
drifts.  On reassembly the internally splined cup-washer must be
compressed, a task most easily accomplished with a hydraulic
press.

Failure to maintain the original spline/tooth orientation often
causes the axles to bind in the CV joint hub during reassembly. 
Take it apart, verify the alignment and try again.

                           Sermonette

The Bentley manual neglects the CV joints, offering neither a
nominal lubrication interval nor torque values.  The Haynes
manual sez to inspect them but to leave them alone unless the
boots are torn or leaking.  That is as invalid as the Bentley
approach; by the time the things are torn or leaking you'll be
faced with the expensive replacement of the CV joint rather than
its messy but necessary lubrication.  (The Haynes method is
correct for the older swing-axle trannys and may well be a
typographical blunder, albeit one of major proportions.)  John
Muir sez keep your CV's greasy and they'll last a long time. 
Despite his many errors and omissions, John Muir's approach is
the most correct of all, at least when it comes to CV's.  

Each of the manuals cited above claims a certain degree of
expertise yet each contains many errors, some minor, some
catastrophic.  (The Chilton manuals are not worthy of mention.) 
Your wisest course is to gather as much information about your
vehicle as you are able, and from as many diverse sources as
possible -- and then to think for yourself.
