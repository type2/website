&gt; Hi! where can I buy one of these cruise control units?
&gt; Thanks :)

I've seen the VDO units or their updated equivalents for sale at
Bosch retail parts suppliers throughout Germany (may not be of much
use to you...) and I believe they can be obtained via VW, as the
factory fit item was also VDO (may be a bit pricey).

Failing that, perhaps try to contact VDO directly at:

VDO Adolf Schindling AG
16252 Frankfurt
Germany
Tel. +49 (0) 69 75860

They may be able to help with supplier details in your area.

Happy festivities,
