Hello EVeryone,

Following up on the Eurovan VR6 note and photo in the May issue of European 
Car, I called the VW 800 number and asked if they had any info on the 
launch date. Unlike previous calls, this time they did give me a more 
specific time. &quot;In the fall, probably September.&quot; Maybe by then my business 
will be doing well enough I could afford one, or if the business is still 
struggling, the VR6 EV will bring the value down of the 5 cyclinder EVs to 
reality. (Probably not. They'll just become more &quot;collectible.&quot;)

BTW, Autotrader now has a website where one can do very specific (or not so 
specific) searches for vehicles, drawing on the 200,000 cars they have 
advertised in their magazines nationwide. Unlike other automotive websites 
(ie. dealernet) a search of the Autotrader site for Eurovans between $1 and 
$20,000 and '92 to '95 came up with nine hits from around the country. For 
a dollar, they will sell you the phone numbers from the listings. Kind of a 
neat way to do a comparitive market analysis, too.

Thats all for now,
Matt Dekker
