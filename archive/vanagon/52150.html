Subject: Re: Diff. Lock 86 Syncro?

&gt; a few days.  He also said that the diff lock is only responsible for the 
&gt; rear wheels so it shouldn't be harmful to drive it on dry pavement for a 
&gt; while.  I understood otherwise - that the vehicle should never be driven on 
&gt; dry pavement with a locked diff.

     trannsmission is bad. DOn NOt Drive in DryPAvement.
