Subject: fitting a radio

I just bought a sony radio/cassette deck for the car (the original vw 
casette had too much tobacco in it to run anymore).  The mounting is 
clearly way different.  Is there a standard kit to buy to install 
something like this, or will I have to manufacture something? It came 
with almost no hardware, and there are no clips to hold it onto the 
dash.  The rubber mount in the back is there, and the plate to cover the 
front, but to support the front, I need some kind of bracket, and I'm not 
sure what to look for.  Has anyone done this?

Thanks,
--
