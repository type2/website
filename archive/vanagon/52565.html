Subject: Area codes by state/province

        Does anyone have a listing of telephone area codes from 
say (201) to (919) showing what state/province each covers?

        When I'm searching national classified ads on-line, it would 
be nice to know how far afield I will have to go to buy the vehicle 
of my dreams.
