The best place to go through the shroud depends on how your linkage is set 
up. The linkage should be set up such that moving it towards the front of 
the bus opens the throttle plate. Once that's set up, find or make a hole 
for the cable to pass through without it bending too much. Then, and this 
is important, install some kind of bushing in the hole so the cable doesn't 
get abraded. I have found that an old carburator jet, drilled out to 1/16&quot; 
or so works great. The brass is naturally lubricating and it's threaded 
making installation simple.
