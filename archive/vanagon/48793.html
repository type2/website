Subject: Trip Report: trouble ahead/trouble behind

hey now,

this weekend i went up to lake lure to pick up amanda and the rest of her
stuff. i didn't expect any troubles because the van had been running
wonderfully as of late and the rebuilt engine was a-purring. trouble has
a way of catching up to you real quick and the year and a half of virtually
no mechanical problems beside a dropped valve seat rushed up and bopped me in
the head.

i pulled outta work at 12am on friday night, intending to do about 3-3 1/2
hours then finding somewhere to crash. about 5 minutes after leaving the
Research Triangle Park i the engine starts sound like the muffler fell off.
at first i thought i had thrown a rod but it didn't sound like that and the
engine was running fine. just sounded mufferless. i pulled into a gas station
and took a look. muffler still there, no leaks in it. that i could tell. turned
off the flash light and saw flame coming outta the third cylinder. oh sh*t.
this must be bad i thought. then i notice a strange bolt lying on the engine
tin.  i didn't think anything of it. i checked the spark plug wire connections,
the spark plugs, etc. all fine. a fella then walked over and mentioned he used
to have a vw. he said my engine didn't sound too good. duh. i then show him
the screw and mentions that it screws in right underneath where the #3 spark
plug hole is..i look, stick it in, tighten it up, start the engine..no exhaust
noise, engine sounds great. i go to thankt he guy but he's left. weird.then it
is back on the highway and i make it across the catawba river and crash at a
rest area near hickory.

before i reach the rest area the van started 'coughing' getting a little
sluggish. i figured it was dirty fuel filters and made a note to change them
and to clean up my gas tank. soon.

up early in the morning...i made it to rutherfordon, nc and filled up. called
amanda at 7:00am and told her i'd be at house in about 20minutes. a few miles
from the gas station i smelled gas. and not just a little gas. ALOT OF GAS!
pulled off fast, grabbed the fire extinguisher, and opened the rear engine
hatch. looked around, a big puddle of it was sitting in the metal pan on the
drivers side underneath the air vent. oh ****. but i remembered the thread
about this a couple of weeks ago...so i reach up there and sure enough i feel
the rubber hose connecting the two metal hoses. as i pull it off, it crumbles
in my hand. oh boy. i musta filled the tank up too much. well, no problem
because i have some extra gas hose. but it's the wrong gauge. i sit down to
think a bit, i tend to get tense in these situations and it's better to clear
my mind first. what i did was i had just enough gas line going from the fuel
pump to the carb so i cut some of that off and used it. i sit for about
20 minutes to let any gas fumes dry up. get to amandas house to find her
a little frantic...it'd been an hour 20 minutes since i had called.

we go out to breakfast, a little country place that serves the kind of
breakfasts you can only get out in the country. hhmmmmm goood. then it's on
to the nearest small town to try and find some gas filters, more gas line,
etc. mishap #3 occured 3 miles later...we are going a good 55mph when the
gas pedal goes limp. amanda and i just look at each other as i pull over to the
side of the road. we take a look...the accelerator cable had broke! about an
inch or two in front of the carb. ah ####. again. hheheehehhe muahahahahaha
well, we walk across the street to where this guy has a little home shop and
borrow some heavy wire and needle nose pliers...the pliers i had had
conviently gone on vacation somewhere....i tried to get something rigged up
for about 1/2 hour but couldn't. it was hot, humid, and sticking your head in
an engine compartment didn't help. amanda got me some water and suggested i let
her take a stab at it. i honestly thought it was hopeless but 5 minutes later
she's got it rigged and i'm looking at her in a new light. i've got a fiancee
that is mechanically inclined and likes doing things like this. oh, while she
was working it, a state trooper pulled up and looked us over while asking if he
could help. all the while he was looking in the van as best he could. i said no
, we are okay. he goes on. amanda and i jump in the van and head to the local
redneck FLAPS. i made a bet they wouldn't have any vw parts. i won! as a matter
of fact, the guy said: &quot;a '74 what? vw..ah, you must be joking!&quot; but he
suggests the local hardware store for some wire fastners and such. well, we
head down there and get the *redneck*cold*stare*treatment*. no he doesn't have
anything to hold to wires together. no needle nose pliers either. i say thanks
and go find what i need anways. then i pay for the pliers and wire clamps.
amanda checks to make sure her handiwork is sitll okay....it's fine so we
decide to head on. but meanwhile, mr. liar is swinging on a porch swing smoking
a ciggerate and we came up with the following song that goes along the rythym
of &quot;IF you are happy then clap your hands:&quot;

&quot;if you are a bastard and know it clap your hands
 *clap* *clap*
 if you are a bastard and know it clap your hands
*clap* *clap*
 sitting on a swing smoking a cigarette
 watching the hippy rats
 *clap* *clap*
 if you are a bastard and know it clap your hands&quot;.

anyways, we hightailed it outta hicksville before the local militia could be
rousted to get us.

the next day, i go to change fuel filters with one i thought would work. i made
one BIG mistake. i have two filters, one between the gas tank and pump, one
between the pump and carb. i forgot to clamp the hose coming from the gas
tank. ie. i undid the clamp on the filter and gas started going everywhere. in
my hair, on the ground, eyes, soaking my clothes. amanda hears me screaming and
rushes to help. i got the hose back on the filter and tightened. by this time
my clothes were soaked and i was starting to burn. it HURT. i stripped and
amanda washed me down with a hose...COLD well water but it felt good. i ran
into the shower. stupid mistake not to clamp that hose. stupid stupid stupid.
i'll never forget now. i hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. a little gas
on your hands don't hurt. but being soaked in it does...i've got the blisters
to prove it.

after getting cleaned up and letting the van sit for a good hour because of all
the spilt gas, we pack up and head out. our little accelerator hookup broke
about the time we got to hickory. we rigged it up again.

no problems on the rest of the 3 hours of the trip. from this weekend's
experience i'm adding the following items to my spare parts carried:

1) extra fuel filters
2) extra fuel line of all gauges needed
3) accelerator and clutch cable
4) spare metal wire

sometimes we learn from our trials and tribulations...i know i have. these
were hassles but i improvised and got back on the road. i'm gonna teach
amanda everything i know, changing oil, timing, valves. it's something we
enjoy doing together. guess that's all that counts.

take care,

jonathan '74 Retrowestie (Rumba)
