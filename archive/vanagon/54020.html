     Water- free for the shipping:   

     I did the Vanagon heads in 1991. Broke all the rule except keeping 
     everything very clean! I took the heads to a belt sander to get 
     the pits out. Used the proper dealer sealer. Reassembled, and installed
     the  standard prestone anti-freeze, with the best Pgh. city water
     I could find. Have not touched it since. It has about 70,000
     miles since the job and has no signs of leaking. Please there
     is much to much talk about anti-freeze and water! I will gladly
     ship anyone all the great Pgh. (5 year) water they want!!!!!!! 
     

       Free  3 Rivers Water- the best to use in your Vanagon!
