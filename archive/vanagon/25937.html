Subject: valves -&gt; rebuild 
Date: Mon, 2 Oct 1995 13:03:35 -0500 (CDT)

Friends,

It looks like I may be due for a top-end overhaul. Yikes!! A couple of
days ago, I mentioned that the valves were *way* out of adjustment after
only 200 miles. Bob Hoover cautiously hypothesized that there may be a
*serious* problem with the &quot;valve train geometry&quot; and that I should
retorque the heads. We're talking about a '75 type 4 engine, 1.8 liter and
fuel-injected. Questions arise...

1) do I really need to drop the engine to retorque the heads? (I've never
dropped an engine before and the thought puts me into a mild state of
panic.)

2) If the engine must be dropped, I might as well bite the bullet and make
somewhat sure this is the last drop for the *next* 50,000 miles. This
engine is a rebuilt with 48,000 miles and it may be wise to replace the
valves at this point anyway. Reworking the heads and install new valves
will be left to a machine shop. But what other jobs would you recommend
for the meantime? Replace clutch, piston and cylinders (or maybe just new
rings?), increase bore (how much?),... 

I'm sure all this has been discussed in the past. Feel free to refer me to
archived contributions.

Thanks!

Sami ('75 Westf.)
