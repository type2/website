&gt;Any Ideas Here????  I am completely frustrated at the prosptect of paying
big
&gt;bucks for exhaust piping but as things stand I don't seem to have much
&gt;choice.   
&gt;

Parts Place lists used exhaust pieces (including Syncros) in their catalog.
 Their number is (810)373-2300.  I've never bought anything from them, so I
can't comment on their quality/service/etc.
