Subject: Re: Re: Need help w/Digest

What does 'digesting' look like so I know when I'm 'digested'?
Also, do you need to unsubscribe from the list?

&gt; &gt;I would like this info also as well as the gopher site.
&gt;
&gt; ok, what is supposed to work is:
&gt; send mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu   with one line of text:
&gt; set vanagon mail digest
&gt;
&gt; and the Gopher site is     halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu, look in Miscellaneous/Vanagon
&gt;
&gt; if the digest thing doesn't work (give it a little while to start 'digesting'
&gt; you), contact Gerry  (or me) and it'll maybe get fixed late at night when the
&gt; workload gets low. :)
