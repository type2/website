Subject: help: 1600 DP intake boot replacement

I am about to undertake, once again, the job I enjoy least on any VW engine.
Worse even than CV joint re-greasing.  A friend's intake manifold boots have
disintegrated *again* and *again* he has asked for my help in replacing them.  

Does anyone have a *good* procedure for removing the center section of the
manifold? *or* 
Has anyone found a way to get those silly split boots to actually seal? 
*or* (if I can talk him into it)(this is the third time and I am tired of it)
Does anyone have a pair of good used SP heads? ;-)
