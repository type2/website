My Bus Changed My Life Tonight
by Jennifer Sarantites

Music by Elton John
Original Lyrics by Bernie Taupin

Available on the album &quot;Love Songs&quot; (MCA, 1996)

When I think of those highway miles,
Long, calm whiles,
Falling asleep in the poptop room &quot;upstairs&quot;,
VW lovers, oh, you really should have been there,
Looking at the heavens perched up high in the perfect chair.

And it's great out here,
There's no city lights anymore.
The comet's so bright lately,
Perfect night for dreaming
Of VWs and stars.

(refrain)
And my bus changed my life tonight,
Way out here.
I almost fell to the big city,
It's better here.
Cities always make me so tired,
Commuting, hypnotized.
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
I'm a Bus lover
And in my Bus I'm going to drive,
Drive away, far away, bye bye.

I've had to spend those many dollars,
Tune up for hours,
Visions of that perfect Bus in my dreams.
I've got the engine dressed up nice and clean
But I've not yet fixed the rust in the seams.
I'm up till four in the morning -
Again!
But I'm doing good,
I've fixed the wiper speed tonight
Just in time, thank god my Bus is still alive.

(refrain)

Yes, I know I've plunged headlong
Into the restoration river,
Clinging to Hoover and Muir,
But I feel I could do this forever.
I'm leaving in the morning,
With my Bus to take me home

(refrain)

My Bus changed my life tonight
My Bus changed my life tonight
My Bus changed my life tonight
My Bus changed my life tonight
My Bus changed my life tonight

So spend your cash
And in your Bus you're not alone

(refrain)
