&gt; Is it best to only let a VW 'specialist' work on your Bus (1982 Vanagon)
&gt; or are things so straightforward that an experienced non-specific mechanic

&gt;  

It depends on what part of the bus you're talking about.  I'd say certain
very &quot;generic&quot; things (e.g., brakes) can be handled by any competent local
mechanic.  For engine work you're probably better off with a specialist.

Personally, I've found the best way to find a good VW mechanic is through
personal recommendations of knowledable friends.  (Unfortunately, the one
VW mechanic I've had consistently good experience with - and found through
recommendations - is over 30 miles away!)

I'd like to say that you can find a competent mechanic through conversation
with him, and by inspection of his shop.  Unfortunately, this isn't always
sufficient.  Several years ago, when I was working away from home, my wife
complained about grinding noise coming from the wheel area when she used
the brakes.  I told her to take the car to &quot;Fritz&quot;, the local &quot;German Car
Repair&quot; specialist.  I'd talked to him before; very Teutonic, _very_
expensive, very slick shop with lots of Mercedes, etc. around.  He reported
that the noise was coming from the speedo cable and it would cost some amount
(big $$$) to fix.  Since it was only the speedo cable making the noise, I
told her to drive the bus to SoCal where I'd meet here for Christmas.

While in SoCal I discovered that the right disk brake pad had worn down to
metal, and the rotor was ruined!  So much for &quot;Fritz.&quot;

Approach other VW drivers you see, and ask them who they use for mechanical
repair, and what their experience has been.  Most VW drivers (especially
bus people!) are happy to give this kind of information.
