Subject:  '83 vw camper van for sale

I'm trying to sell an '83 camper van 
for a friend.  It has ~138k miles, 
new tires, new paint, new master cylinder,
and new rear brakes - all within the
last year.  Asking price is $4,500 U.S.
and it's located in Chula Vista, California.
If you're interested, please e-mail
me direct at fred_at_caliban.ucsd_dot_edu unless
you feel it's appropriate to do 
otherwise.

thanks,
Fred
