&gt; &gt;&gt; hi all ive only been on this list a short while and i am not sure where to

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you've only been on the list a short time, then you got a welcome message
&gt; &gt;which you were supposed to read and keep.  I've half a mind to remove everyone
&gt; &gt;who claims they've only been on t
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; sorry man i lost it before i could print it by holding the trash button
&gt; down to long ive wanted to unsubscribe and then resubscribe just to get
&gt; the message again but didnt want to miss any info being slung around. and
&gt; if your going to be that way than tuff shit i dont need it. thanks for the
&gt; archives list any way and happy new year Later Jonce:)

I can't EVEN believe that I sent that message.
I apologize profusely.  It was clearly a case of too much beer.

It's an honest mistake to not read or get the welcome message and nothing that
I should have been slinging at ANYONE.  I can only hope that I fully intended
a cancel and not a send of that message.

I'm Sorry and I deserved your anger.
