&gt;     Since I can't seem to find a good used set of torsion 
&gt; bars, I've thought about removing the torsion bars and 
&gt; flipping them right to left and reinstalling them so they 
&gt; would twist in the opposite direction and lift the front up 
&gt; a bit. (I'm not sure if this would work?)
&gt; 
Aren't the torsion bars, front and rear already prestressed,
ie. taken plastic in the direction opposite that in which they
are loaded?  If this is the case and your bars have sagged enough
to take a plastic set in the opposite direction, a definite
possibility, reversing them would probably be a very, very
short lived cure as they would rapidly sag even further from
having been origionally prestressed in the direction they are
now loaded in, I think the only solution is a new used set.
Incidently, what is the diameter of the axle beam on a split?
I was thinking although normal bug style adjusters probably
wont fit, Gene Berg sells these neat adjusters that weld onto
the origional beam after you grind or mill a narrow slot, if you
havent seen them, they are just two serrated pieces one that welds
to the beam, the other that meshes with it and carries an origional
VW style spring set nut, certainly if the radius of the bus tube
isn't that much bigger, one could flatten the adjusters a little in
a press then weld them to the larger bus tube, Ive been thinking
about ordering a set and giving them a try on my '71 in order to
get a more adjustable suspension and lift it a little, they
are pretty cheap.

Just my ramblings on the subject,
