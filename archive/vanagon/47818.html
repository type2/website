Subject: trepidations

On July 22nd, I bought a 1985 Westfalia with 96,000 miles in Dallas, TX and
immediately started the 1,600 mile trip home to Wyoming.  The vehicle was
outstanding during the trip (except for the refrigerator) so I was getting
the warm, fuzzy feeling about my decision (I am going to sell my '92 Toyota
Paseo and RELY on the vanagon).

My son then suggested I subscribe to the list.  I have obviously done so.
Unfortunately, what I read on the list is rapidly destroying the &quot;warm,
fuzzy&quot;.  I realize that what I am reading is prejudiced by bad news being
broadcast more often than good news, and the probability that many of the
messages coming from people who enjoy working on their vehicle ( I am
ignorant about mechanics!).  Add to this the fact that Volkswagons are truly
foreign in Wyoming, and I am certainly trepidatious about my decision.

At this point, I am strongly hoping that many of you can give expert advice
to a mechanically inexperienced vanagon driver (I also recently purchased a
1986 Jetta for my daughter to drive!).

Maybe I am plain stupid, but in about two weeks, I plan on driving the
&quot;Westy&quot; to Seattle and back!

My first two know tasks will be to replace the thermostat (Is that a big
job?  I know it wasn't that tough twenty years ago in my Dodge) and fixing
the air conditioning (compressor?, again, major problem?).

Thanks.
