Subject: Re: upgrading 86-up headlights



&gt;&gt; The low beams on my 87 Westfalia are really terrible

Really?  I had been thinking of replacing the headlights on my '85 
with the headlights from the '87 parts bus I just bought, because 
my '85's headlights are so dim.  I had been told that the '86-on 
headlights are significantly brighter.  Is that correct?
