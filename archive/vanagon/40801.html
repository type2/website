Subject: change oil after storage?

Well, I finally pulled my 82 Westy out of storage after a long Wisconsin 
winter and sure enough Monday it's snowing!!  Oh well, it just feels good to 
have her on the road again. I was pleasently surprised to hear very little 
knocking of the lifters when I first fired it up. Anyway, right before I 
stored it I put in fresh oil. I believe I heard someone say one time that 
you should change the oil after storage also even if it was done prior. 
Should I put in fresh oil?  If so why?
