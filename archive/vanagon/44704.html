Subject: Re: Attention KMart Shoppers-generic cup holders

&gt;Where are these cup holders installed on your Vanagon?  I've been
&gt;wanting to get some for my 85 GL but I've never found any that I
&gt;liked or that I thought would fit anywhere easily.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,

Greg,

For the front passengers the cup holders are located between the front
seats but attached to the &quot;pedestal&quot; that the passenger seat sits on.
Another way to look at it is if you where sitting in the front passenger
seat and let your left arm hang down your finger tips would be touching the
cup holders.  The other cup holders are located on each side of the bench
seat in back attached to the interior wall of the van.  Another one is
located on the van wall near one of the rear facing seats.
