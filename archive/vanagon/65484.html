Jon -

The Fuel Pump installed on 75-79 FI Beetles, 75-79 Breadloaves and 80-91
Vanagons are all the same pump, OE VW 251-906-091.  Two different
manufacturers are available - Bosch and Pierburg (I run a Pierburg on
mine).  Don't know where the Bosch is made at this moment (Germany,
Spain, Brazil, who knows?), but the Pierburg is made in Germany.

Pierburg Price is currently $182.58 and the Bosch is $175.00.  Rebuilts
are probably available in the $100 range (exch), give or take $20.

I like the Pierburg because it is incased in rubber and helps deaden the
noise a bit.  Another Pierburg difference is that it uses &quot;ring-type&quot;
terminals instead of push-ons like the Bosch, but it comes with the
terminals and new &quot;weather&quot; boots for this type.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;What are the differences between an 82 air-cooled Vanagon fuel pump
&gt;and an
&gt;87 watercooled Vanagon fuel pump?  Is there any others that are
&gt;interchangable?
