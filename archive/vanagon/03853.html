Subject: Saddest day of my car-owning life :-(

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Its dead. Deceased. Joined the Choir Invisbule...NuBus ('82' Diesel) left me...

The day started so nice. Just spent $$$ fixing the seals and a new
muffler. Gas tank all sealed up...

It was runnig so good, I actually said &quot;She's running TOO well. I am 
always afraid when there is nothing obviously wrong.&quot;
