&lt;&lt; My transmission, Im afraid, is not long for this earth.  It has been 
 whining at me the past week and a half and lately its getting worse.  I 
 can't have a conversation unless Im stopped. If Im alone, i turn the 
 radio up REAL loud and pretend everything's fine! ;)
 I took it to a VW specialist near me and he replaced the oil with some 
 synthetic stuff.  It hasn't helped.  he said to just drive it til it 
 goes,but I don't want to get stranded somewhere.
 My questions are:
 1.  Should I look into having it checked into a little more thoroughly, 
 or is it a lost cause?
 
 2. Are any of the other van transmissions adaptable or do I need another 
 diesel 4 speed?  I read in Bob's trip report that he met with a woman 
 with a 5 speed. Is this a canada only thing?
 
 Im getting pretty frustrated with the problems Im having.  im thinking of 
 selling and buying early 70's bay window. HELP

If you do not plan to buy a new one, do not wait for it to fail.  It is
possible that you only need a pinion bearing.  If you wait to long, you will
ruin the Ring and pinio.  These are not readily avialable for the diesel.  A
gas trans will work buy changing the bell housing but the gears will be to
tall for the diesel.  I can repair the box for you if you wish to send it to
me.  I am on Long Island,NY.
