&gt;&gt; I have discovered that Kelly Blue Book publishes a volume for older vehicles.
&gt;&gt; The current issue is May-August 1966, '76--89 Cars and Trucks.  My credit
&gt;&gt; union has a copy that members can read, but not copy or remove from the
&gt;&gt; premises.

&gt;&gt;       Special
&gt;&gt;       Announcement
&gt;
&gt;NADA also publishes their older car book, I think current one covers much
&gt;the same as this, only the last couple years of Bus are in it, my local
&gt;library keeps a copy try yours.

Another good source is the Old Car Price Guide (ISSN 0194-6404), which is
published quarterly in the US. It contains prices for 130,000 cars from 1901
to 1986. Volkswagen prices start with the 1945 model, and go to 1986
waterpumper prices. The copy I have is now 2 years old, but it came in handy
for estimating a value for my bug for the insurance company.
