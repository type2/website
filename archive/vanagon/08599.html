&gt; On the bug, before the oil cooler was shifted, the # 3 exhaust valve would
&gt; normally run the hottest of the four and so it was agood idea to set it
&gt; in extra thousand open. I have a #3 exhaust valve ('69 KG Cabrio in
&gt; storage) sitting on my desk
&gt; here; it is warped and has a chip out of it. Before it and the others were
&gt; replaced , I could hear a tick tick tick sound which I guess was gas
&gt; escaping past the valve. Anyway, now with the 2 litre and even 1.6 litre in
&gt; the European Vanagon, the oil cooler is not even near the #3 cylinder and
&gt; I have heard different views on whether #.3 still runs hot. Some have said
&gt; it does, others say it runs the same as the others. In addition I have
&gt; heard something about welding or strenghthening no.3 cylinder on bus
&gt; engines, which would suggest it might be prone to overheating. Can anyone
&gt; clarify this? TIA - DC
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; I'm going to take a non-traditional and perhaps controversial position
 on cylinder #3 over-heating. I don't think it has anything to do with
 the location of the oil cooler. #3 seems to run hot on Type IVs, which have
 the oil cooler adjacent to cylinder #4. It runs hot on doghouse cooled 
 uprights where the oil cooler isn't blocking air to any cylinder. I think it
 gets hot because it gets the least cooling air due to it's location. It's the
 furthest from the fan, it's the farthest from the cooling air exit, it's just 
 plain out-of-the-way, and the cooling air doesn't want to go up there on
 it's way from the fan to the exit. Picture an upright fan engine from the 
 left side: There's the exhaust side of the head up by the flywheel, the fan
 is blowing air down between the cylinders, the exit is back at the rear of 
 the engine. The &quot;path of least resistance&quot; definitly doesn't include an 
 excursion up to the exhaust side of cylinder #3. Same thing for the type IV,
 again, cylinder #3 is furthest forward, farthest from the fan. The cooling
 air exit is also at the rear, requiring the longest - and least probable -
 path for the cooling air to take. 

 Anyone else have some experience or thoughts on this?
