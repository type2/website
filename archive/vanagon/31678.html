&gt; Subject: Pop Top seal replacement
&gt; I've priced new seal kits at $600 (dealer) or $150-200 (aftermarket),  but
I
&gt; was wondering how tough they are to install.

I bought a seal kit (pop-top part $70, luggage rack, or stationary part $30)
from an ad in one of the VW/T&amp;A magazines.
I can find the info. for you if you wish, but the ad is usually there.

Installation was quite easy - my father and I did the pop-top part in about
2 hours, and we were taking our time.
We removed the old seal and cleaned the edge of the fiberglass pop-top.  The
new seal is easy to get on by hand, but use a rubber mallet
to ensure its all the way on.  I was suspicious of how well it would hold
without using any glue, but there is no problem - the metal channel inside
the rubber holds it on very well.

&gt; It appears they  thin side section
&gt; is glued to the wider front section at the two  front corners - does it
come
&gt; this way, or is special glue needed?

The glue came with the seal in my case.  Take time to study the enclosed
description/drawing.  They have you cut the round seal on the side so that
the flat seal on the front goes into it, then glue it.  Worked fine for me. 
After 6 months still looks great.
I have not done the luggage rack part yet, but it should be easier - it will
all be one piece.

&gt; If I'm looking at a Westy which needs a seal, is it better to get the 
seller
&gt; to replace it first, or talk him down on price and do it  myself. I'd
rather do
&gt; it myself &amp; know that it's done right, but I'm  not sure if this is a
tough job
&gt; or not. I see so many vans with  failing seals, that I'm beginning to
wonder if
&gt; there's a reason for  the owners not fixing them.

My OPINION is do it yourself.  If, like you, he thought it hard/expensive,
you can get him to lower the price more than it will actually cost you
to do it.  

Before acting on my advice, make sure there is no major difference in the
seals on my breadloaf and the vanagons you are looking at.
I can't imagine that there are, but .....    Anyone?
