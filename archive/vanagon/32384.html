Subject: Crossover Pipe 80 Vanagon

I'm looking to replace my exhaust system before my annual DOT inspection =
2/29/96.  I've found all the parts EXCEPT the illusive crossover pipe.  =
Does anyone know who makes a replacement?  I've found the muffler, =
tailpipe and catalytic converter.  But no crossover pipe.  I haven't =
tried VW yet. What say ye?!
