&gt;The &quot;1835&quot; engine has the same case as a 1600, just with bigger pistons and
&gt;cylinders (and a stroker crankshaft?  Damn, I can't remember!).  In other
&gt;words, the mounts would be the same.  In fact, you wouldn't even have to
&gt;get a different engine, just buy the parts and install them onto your
&gt;present engine.  I have a friend with a bug set up similar to Lee's
&gt;description (except it is around 2100cc) and it gives my Mustang a run for
&gt;it's money from 0-60.  Veeeeery impressive what you can do with a type I
&gt;motor...

A 1835cc is 92mm bore X 69mm stroke.  This is the stock stroke.
BTW- I new here.
