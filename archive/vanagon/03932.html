&gt; &gt; 	Now the only question relates to David's posting.  David:  You
&gt; &gt; talk about hill climbing at 48MPH in 3rd or 4th.  In third the
&gt; &gt; temperature gets very hot, so what do you do?  Stay in 3rd to keep the
&gt; &gt; pressure up, or go the 4th to keep the temp down?
&gt; 
&gt; I slow down to 40 (or even 35) in third to keep a balance (hopefully) of
&gt; pressure and temperature.  That's why I want to get an external cooler
&gt; or do *something* to reduce oil temps - because it is really annoying to
&gt; have the power to climb hills at a reasonable speed but not be able to
&gt; do so because of the oil overheating...

Throw away those damn gauges and just drive your van.  Quit worrying about
what the gauges are tellin' you and enjoy your trip!
