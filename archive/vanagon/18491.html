Hello Cris,

The mirror is removed by a Twist-Pull sort of move, it'll require
quite a bit of force.

You can seperate the stem and mirror by pulling hard but carefully,
it won't do much good to the opening in the mirror, 
when you do this keep in mind that sometimes there is some sort of spacer
behind the ball.

I personally think that using some sort of a heating device would do any good.

Have a nice day :)  Brian.
