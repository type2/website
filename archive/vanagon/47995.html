 Well, since it's friday, I was wondering .. ..
  Dennis said &quot;The Speedo can be reset by resetting the pointer on the 
 shaft.&quot;  So that would leave the speedometer showing about 4 miles per 
 hour while its parked.  Now wouldn't that run up a lot of miles on the 
 odometer that we never drive?  Dennis?
  &gt;&gt;
The pointer actually sits on a pin when at rest.  If you lift the needle over
the pin, you will see that it sits well below the home position.  It can then
be gently pulled off it's mounting and reinstalled in a different posisiton.
 Then place it back onto it's rest pin.  The speedo reading has nothing to do
woth the odometer.  That is directly gear driven off the cable.

Dennis.
