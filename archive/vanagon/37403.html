Subject:       81 Westy fs in UK?

I've got an 81 Westy (lhd) that I'll want to sell before leaving this 
green and pleasant land in early June... :(

I think I've seen a reference to something called the &quot;aircooled 
advertiser&quot; on the list, but the phone number I copied down must have 
been wrong.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

Cheers,

Rick Harper
