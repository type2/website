Subject: Web page update
Date: Fri, 3 Feb 1995 09:33:42 -0800 (PST)

Last night I added some more stuff to my VW page.  There is now a page for
Dave Garth with five pictures of his vented catlytic heater and self-made
hot water system.  There are also 21 new pictures of the pfeiffer trip
although I didn't finish descriptions for all of them, and I still have more
to scan in (10:30 pm is late enough to stay at work on a weeknight!).

Also, these new pictures were developed as jumbo 4x6 pictures, and scanned
in at 90 dpi instead of 72, so they are much larger.  To keep download time
short, I turned down the quality scale on the jpegs a little (from best to
normal) and so even though the images are physically larger, most of them
are about 35k full size.  I am looking at them from home over a 14.4 modem
as I write this, and the wait time is about 20 seconds for each full sized
picture.  Not too bad, methinks.

The images on the web page will look best when viewed on systems with 16 or
24-bit color.  8-bit displays will cause dithering, which makes the pictures
look a little grainy.  I haven't found a good way to avoid this, unfortunately.

As usual, the pictures have thumbnail previews of under 5k, so you can
possibly avoid waiting to download larger image files that you don't want to
see.  Also as usual, the pictures are also available in 24-bit tiff and 8-bit
GIF format via anonymous FTP from bolo.nosc_dot_mil.  Right now, all of the new
pictures are in ftp/picture/vw/pfeiffer/new, cause I forgot to move them,
but eventually they will be in more appropriate places.

There is also a new link to list member Richard Kurtz's home page.  Check
out his beautiful 67 Samba sunroof that is for sale (WHAT!?!?!??).

Enjoy!!!
