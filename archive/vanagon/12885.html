&gt;We have been getting about 16 mpg on our '81 Westy for both town and city
&gt;driving.  This seems a little low to us.  How are your vans doing for
&gt;mileage?

my old 1980 bus AVERAGED 18.5 mpg for 110,000 miles (combined) ... but don't
forget: your camper gear ADDS quite a bit of weight to the bus. so your
city-driving mpg is likely very low ... like around 12-13. and that will
really drag down a nice 20mpg run on the highway.

also check and see how many traffic lights and stop signs you are sitting at
in town ... idling in the driveway or the mall parking lot will REALLY drop
your mpg average, and it will do it quickly.  with my little trip computer,
it's amazing to watch the average drop very fast from just sitting and idling
(which gets ZERO mpg). my point being, that if your route to work has a lot
of stop signs and red lights, that might be contributing a lot to your &quot;low&quot;
mpg.
