&gt; &gt; outfit.  They got it going on 110V and propane, and said everything was okay.
&gt; &gt; You bet, on Thursday I got it going on 110V and things were nice and cold in
&gt; &gt; the morning.  Before we left I got it going on propane.  Took a some doing
&gt; &gt; which was a little disconcerting.  I had been told not to run it on 12V while
&gt; &gt; riding because it still draws a lot of current.  &quot;Turn on the propane and
&gt; &gt; forget about it until you get home&quot; was the advise I got from more than one
&gt; &gt; person.  When I got set up at camp fridge wasn't on.  I wasn't out of propane
&gt; &gt; because I got the stove going.  I then went through the whole procedure of 
&gt; &gt; getting the fridge going again and sure enough it lit and stayed on all nigh
t. 
&gt; &gt; I discovered that the fridge would turn off when I was *driving* because when we
&gt; &gt; got to the trail head of our hike it was off again!  Obviously the pilot light 
&gt; &gt; was being snuffed out.  Again, can anyone identify with this?  Is
&gt; &gt; there a solution?
&gt; 
&gt;     My manual recommends:
&gt; 
&gt;     - 110V to chill down before leaving
&gt; 
&gt;     - 12V whilst in route (The alternater is supposed to balance the
&gt; draw on the coach battery; and, in fact, does on mine. In fact, I can run
&gt; around town on 12V, make parking stops, and not notice any significant
&gt; drop in coach voltage.)
&gt; 
&gt;     - Propane after setup.  Must be within 3^ of level.

I'd agree with this plan also. It works well for me. I usually skip 
the pre-cooling if much of the food is frozen or cold going in. If I'm 
driving 2 hrs or more, the fridge is fine on 12v. Also, my manual 
states the 12v load is 7amps, which is less than running your 
headlights, so it shouldn't be a problem.
