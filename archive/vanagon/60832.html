&lt;&lt; Anyone else going to the show in Minneapolis on June 8th? Type2 listmember
 Nate Dennison and I are hoping to go (provided his '81 Westy doesn't give
 us any trouble like it did the last two times we tried to use it for
 something big) and are always interested in meeting more listmembers. Drop
 me a line if you're going!

I'll be there!  Look for a gold GL Syncro.  I might put it in the show again.
 It's not in the best possible condition (some rust) but it was the only
Syncro in the show last year.

'87 Syncro GL

P.S.
For the info for all.  The show is at Westside VW at County Road 100 and
Cedar Lake Road in Saint Louis Park, MN (west side of Minneapolis).
 Admission is either $2 or $3.  I don't know if it was changed, I missed last
months meeting.  I was in Chicago teaching some Military Pay classes.
