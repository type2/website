Hello Folks,

First of all, many many thanks to Joel, Steve and others who responded to my
inquiry about the idle hunting problems.  I'm very excited cuz the best the 
dealer could tell me was &quot;everything is fine&quot;. 

I bought this car before Christmas and as yet don't have a Bentley manual which
includes the 1987 model year.  So, a question or two please ... 

'87 models come with the Digifant system, Right?  .  Looks as if the coolant temp 
sensor I need to relace is mounted right under the thermostat housing and can be
easily removed from above.  Apparently you remove the retaining clip, slide
out the old/in the new, and you're done.  I suppose some coolant loss is 
inevitable, so I should release any residual cooling system pressure first.  
There must be a rubber seal--should it be replaced too?

Thanks,

Dick Eager
