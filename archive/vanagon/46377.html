&gt; I'm for the split.

So am I, but with reservations...

&gt; Over the last couple of years of Vanagon list activity I've gained a strong
&gt; impression that the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not only less
&gt; mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seen less willing to acquire
&gt; the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their orphaned vehicles
&gt; alive, a failure of spirit -- or Fear of Grease -- that virtually assures
&gt; such machines will end up on the junk heap.

This may be true - but some of us airheads aren't the most adept either! :) I personally enjoy
the range of mechanical ability represented on the list - it makes us newbies fell like we can
go ahead and be stupid and ask stupid questions, which is the only way we're going to learn
from people with more experience. That and breaking down - my favorite way to learn. ;) We
airheads have the advantage that, well, if we try hard enough we can do just about everything
our vehicles need. Waterboxers scare me - and they probably scare a lot of other people from
getting in there and figuring out what's going on...

That doesn't mean that when I'm sitting in my sliding door on the side of the highway waiting
for Millie to cool down I don't dream about floating down the highway in a mint '90 Westy with
the a/c on... ;)
