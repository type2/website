Subject: re:Engine Tin

All,

I am in need of a piece of engine tin for my 79 Westy.  It is the left rear
corner. If anyone has this piece, or knows of a mail order source for it,
I would appreciate it.  I went to Austin VeeDub for it.  He laughed at me
for even asking for it.  The guy said if they are lucky they get 2(yes 2)
of them in a year, and he sells them as fast as he gets them for, get this
$50.00!  I cannot believe that they are this hard to come by.  I realize
that those pieces are the first to get cut for AC and whatnot, but not
all busses had AC so where are these pieces?


Let me know

David

79 Westy
