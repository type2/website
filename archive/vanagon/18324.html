&gt; You want trim?  Don't we all?
&gt; 
&gt; And what is this trim?  Is it crome?

Ahhh yes, we all want trim, but the kind for splitties is harder to find than 
the kind you might find in bars. Oh and yes, it is chrome.

A friend of mine managed to scrounge swap meets and what not for a complete set 
for his '61 23 window, only to have some dork steal every last piece off of his 
bus while it sat in his driveway one night. I think he almost cried. To add 
insult to injury, they stole his glass tailights and bezels as well.

Is nothing sacred?

-Erik ('65 21 window with no engine louver trim or glass tailights from the 
factory! ;b)
