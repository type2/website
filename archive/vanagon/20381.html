Subject: Leaking Heads?


Hi,

We have recently bought an 87 Vanagon and with it the proverbial
leaking head problem. I've seen in the past people having
various degrees of success having VWofA chipping in with 
some of the replacement costs...I also dimly recall someone
mentioning an autoline arbitration phone number.

As a proud owner of an air-cooled beast I was oblivious to all of this
up to now. I'd appreciate any comments/info/success/failure stories
related to this problem. The relevant data on the 87 is:

1987 Syncro Weekender with 103K miles.

Thanks a lot
