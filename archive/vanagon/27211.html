&gt; I have a question. What on earth is the use of the little gadget on the 
&gt; underside, foward of the right side rock guard on the 1800 74 bus.I have 
&gt; just purchased this bus and am trying to figure out what has been done to 
&gt; it. This gadget has cloth tubing( cut or disconnected) going in and out. 
&gt; BTW, it is between the tran and engine. 

Sounds like the fuel pump.

&gt;   Also, what is  easiest way to figure out the location of the various 
&gt; senders. Some listing are of interest but I am unable to find out where they 
&gt; are.    Many thanks     John Jordan   Spfld, IL 

There is an oil pressure sender next to the distributor.  It turns on
the idiot light in the dash when the pressure drops to 5-8 psi.  Or is
it 6-9 psi?  I can never remember.  Any manual covering '74 busses
should be able to tell you.
