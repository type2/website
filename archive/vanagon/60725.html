Subject: need advice re: '87 Westy purchase

Well, here I am looking for some good will on the Vanagon list again! 
After having been discouraged from buying an air-cooled Vanagon Westy (I 
want air conditioning that is safe to run in Arkansas/Texas heat!), I 
just located an '87 Westfalia. 76,000 miles, clean interior, couple of 
minor dings on the body, but looks nice. Someone added a removable 
captain's chair behind the front two seats - interesting touch! The price 
looks good to me - $6300 - but it's an _automatic_. Would anyone care to 
offer any opinions on such a vehicle? Is the transmission reliable? Is it 
safe to cruise at 70 for extended periods? How does the price sound? 
We're talking stove, fridge, power windows, all the bells and whistles.

Any input is really appreciated. It's on a car lot, and they expect to 
move it quickly (of course! ;^)  ) Oh yeah, the price is a &quot;slightly 
haggled&quot; cash price.

Much obliged,
