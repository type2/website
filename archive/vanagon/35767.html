&gt; Vanatics,
&gt; 
&gt; I saw a new camping product recently that looks intriguing.  It's called the
&gt; Car Top Tent, and I read an article about it in &quot;Four Wheel Drive &amp; Sport
&gt; Utility&quot; magazine.  It is basically a folding tent that fastens to roof racks
&gt; on the top of a car (or Vanagon!).  It consists of a pair of platforms that
&gt; are hinged together and a tent in between.  Then traveling (or in storage)
&gt; the platforms are folded together and the tent is collapsed between them.  It
&gt; measures 48&quot; x 60&quot; x estimated 10&quot; thick in this state.  When you want to set
&gt; up for the nite and use the tent, you remove the travel cover and swing the
&gt; top platform up and over with its attached ladder.  The ladder extends down
&gt; to meet the ground and hold up the platform that you've just folded out.  The
&gt; unfolding process automatically sets up the tent and you're ready to climb
&gt; in.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears (from the pictures &amp; descriptions) to be very high quality and
&gt; design, however I haven't seen one in preson yet.  It includes a 2&quot; foam
&gt; mattress that is larger than queen size - I forget the dimensions.  The
&gt; weight is 69 lbs.  It can hold up to 400 lbs - depending on your vehicle &amp;
&gt; roof racks.  The roof rack is NOT included.
&gt; 
&gt; I called the company about it and they quoted me prices over the phone and
&gt; sent me a brochure.  The &quot;regular&quot; price seems pretty steep, but they're
&gt; having a winter sale through February that makes the price almost reasonable.
&gt;  Here's what they quoted me:
&gt; 
&gt; Regular price:  $699.
&gt; Sale price: $399.
&gt; Optional ladder A-frame extension for tall vehicles:  $64.
&gt; Shipping from Phoenixville, PA: $81.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not certain of the A-frame &amp; shipping prices, but they're close.
&gt; I think all VW Type II will need the A-frame option.
&gt; 
&gt; I really like the idea of having the tent-on-top.  Just the ticket for us
&gt; non-Westys!  Right now I'm searching for ways to afford/justify the purchase.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're interested you can call them at (800) CAR TOP1.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else seen or used one of these, I'd be anxious to here more about
&gt; it from someone who has.
&gt; 
&gt; Usual disclaimers, no financial interest...

&gt; .-I have seen this in person,at a trade show in L.A. 6 months ago.  I to 
was impressed with this product. I do'nt personally have a need for this 
item,but looked great for a large family or something.
