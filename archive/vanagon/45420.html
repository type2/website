Subject: Seeking advice as a VW newbie

Hi all. I've been lurking here for a few weeks and have found much of the
information to be very helpful, informative, and intimadating.

I just bought a 1975 bus. My mechanic, having owned VW's in the past gave
his blessing, if for no other reason than the rustless body! The rebuilt
engine has 7,000 or so miles on it, needs a new exhaust, and, since the
breakdown we had on our first weekend, the points, ingnition coil, and
condenser have been replaced (bus baptism as my roommate called it).

My question for you folks is, what now? I am not mechanically inclined
(although from what I've been reading, that may have to change!), but I do
have a guy that I trust (my roommate THINKS he's mechanically inclined, but
I haven't seen any real evidence of this... he's a pretty darn good drummer
though).

Anyway, I know I need to get an operator's manual, an idiot's guide, and
that I love my bus and want to treat it with care. I want to have it
forever! I've been good and read the FAQ's and read the list exchange
quietly. Please reward me with your sage advice.  TIA
