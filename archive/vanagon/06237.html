I agree with the sentiment of the Coast over the Sierras in Winter.

I have lived here on the California Central Coast for 26 years and camped 
in almost every campground. Morro Bay and Montana De Oro are nice, but, IMO 
the most beautiful campground on the California Coast (in the 
Winter) is Pfeifer Big Sur State Park. The weather there in the Winter is 
usually the warmest on the whole coast...a little banana belt micro climate.
Huge redwoods, waterfalls, river, ocean. It has it all.
