Subject:      Fresh air vent motor

Good morning to all,
Since I'm doing everything else I've been putting off for years, I've
decided to tackle the blower for the fresh air vents... I now have just the
high speed for the blower, medium and low don't work. I know there's one or
two resistors that regulate the speed and I assume they're kaput. I also
realize that VW built the entire van around that blower motor... My
question is; any of you folks out there tackled this project sucessfully
and lived to tell about it. Or...should I just be happy with the balls to
the wall, full on, high speed that's left?
