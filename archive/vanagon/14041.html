Subject: Exc. Compression, but...

Compadres;
    My baby DOESN'T need a new engine after all!! Turns out the ignition
wires were just arcing and the cylinders weren't doin' their funky thang!!
After replacing them and doing a valve adjustment, and replacing points and
condenser, the compression reading showed all cylinders at or near 120!!!!
    The problem now is this:::the carbuerator. It is probably filthy. Can I
add additives to help blow out the crap, or does it have to be removed and
cleaned?? How hard is that to do?? Is it expensive to have it done by a
mechanic?? Also, I can't get my brake lights to come on. The taillights work
when I put on the headlights...but no brake lights!! Do I have to replace the
whole socket assembly? Could it be a fuse?? Hurry!!! I have to get it
inspected by Tues.!!!! I can't stand the pressure anymore!!!   ack.
Again, a multitude o' thanks!
Rachel
