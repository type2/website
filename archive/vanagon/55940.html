Subject: Re: Test driving '87 syncro - what to check?

I wrote a short piece on this a while back. Check:
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swbuying.htm

I'd add a careful look at the CV joint boots: at the
inner and outer end of each axel, look for a rubber
sheath. If its torn, cracking etc, its a caution sign.
During the test drive, listen carefully for a clicking 
noise linked to vehicle speed-that would be a CV problem.

I don't know about the Hawaii +cost factor, but 
around here any Syncro starts looking good at 
around $3000.

Good luck,

Tom F.
