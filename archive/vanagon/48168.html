Subject: Cars salespersons who are WWW/email ignorant...

Since it's friday...

Something that has amazed me for the longest time is the volume of vehicle
sales persons who don't have a clue as to the workings of a computer,
knowledge of &quot;the web&quot;, and or capabilities of email groups.

The sales MANAGER of the worlds largest Dodge dealer where I  &quot;stole&quot; my '83
Vanagon Westy responded by telling me that computers are &quot;too hard.&quot; Yup, I
thought that standing in the hot sun or cold winter and smoking cigarettes
and starving is easier, huh?! The sales manager was also the genius who
wholesaled the '83 westy with 23,800 real first box miles to me for $4000.
because it was &quot;One o' them thar Volkswagens an' not a real car like a Dodge.&quot;
I would think that if sales was my life blood that I would get hooked up to
the nines and write the hardware/software/server(service provider) off as a
business expense.
Even if I was restricted to only getting or selling vehicles through one
dealership I still would be trolling for &quot;Wannabes&quot; for the on-hand
inventory that I was trying to sell.
Hmmm... Maybe there is a market out there for setting these schmoes up with
a system...
What thoughts do the list members have on this one?
