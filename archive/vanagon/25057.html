Subject: Classified Listings on the Net


I'm hoping one day to be able to inform the list that I am the proud owner 
of a Westy, but I've had zero luck finding one.  Does anyone have a listing 
of newspapers or classifieds that are on the net?  I'm specifically looking 
for something on the east coast of the US.

Thanks
PEJ
