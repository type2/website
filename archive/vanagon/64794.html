&gt;
&gt;A good shop with excellent VW mechanics who know Westfalias is &quot;Lorne Park
&gt;Car Centre&quot; 905-823-8787 They are located west of Toronto in Mississauga
&gt;near Erin Mills and Lakeshore
&gt;
&gt;A BAD shop (In my opinion) is Hayman Motors _at_ 416 636 6789. If you need an
&gt;obscure part for an old VW Hayman probably have it but you should avoid
&gt;having work done there. Plan on spending at least one hour to pick up one
&gt;part from Hayman. Located in north Toronto near Dufferin &amp; Finch
&gt;
&gt;Salims 416-463-5464 I have not used but have talked to people who are very
&gt;pleased with good work at low prices. I understand you can get a used tranny
&gt;and a rebuilt engine installed in say a 76 Westfalia for around $2000. I
&gt;would appreciate any other comments on Salims from list members.Located in
&gt;SE Toronto near Coxwell &amp; Eastern.
&gt;
&gt;Another good shop (I have heard) is Mantis Racing in Oakville west of
&gt;Toronto. They somtimes have avalible good rebuilt engines etc. In general
&gt;their prices are higher but good commentson their work. Comments from list
&gt;members please.
&gt;
&gt;All prices are Canadian.
&gt;
&gt;By the way I am in digest mode and don't know how to easily reply to a
&gt;single message from digest mode. Is there an easy way?
