Subject: '60 CrewCab Controls

Just picked up a dented, rusty CrewCab, VIN 596007. Will stop the rust
and use it as a truck until I find time to make it smooth. 
A question.
What are the controls for on the front of the front seat? I know the
turning knob is for the heater, but the two pulls are a mystery. One is
broken off. Is one for the reserve tank? The other?
