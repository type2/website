&gt;I skimmed over the CR article, and don't remember if they mentioned
&gt;exactly what makes and models they ran these tests on. Anybody know?

every cab i've seen in NYC (since Checker went out of business) was the
cheapest 4-door Chevy they could buy ... with a V-8 engine.

which i thought was rather odd ... cause i didn't see a single Ford the
whole time i was there. anybody know why? or if it's changed?
