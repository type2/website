EV owners with their highly reliable dependable vans don't need this 
support as much as earlier vans.... ;^)

No VWUS/VWoA has forgotten how to market vans in this country.  We EV 
owners are mostly real fond of our investments.

&gt; I'm looking to replace my '84 GTI with something bigger for 
&gt; towing my sailplane trailer (only 1000 lb, but 26' long!).
&gt; Will a '93 work for this?  Any comments about special things
&gt; to look for in buying a used one?

I bet the EV would be darned good for this.  I'm particularly fond of the 
MV model.  More room in it than anything except a oversized American 
Van.  Plenty of power for towing that much weight.  Extremely stable in 
my experience to handle the size of the trailer -  but that is basically 
a guess.  I've towed a Thing ('73 VW s/uv) with both my EV and my Chevy 
S10 Pickup.  EV is FAR superior for towing Things to S10s with small V6s 
(of course again in my opinion and experience).

EV hitch available through VW dealers (at least the one's I've checked)  
is rated for 3500 pounds.  REceiver type hitch that bolts right up to the 
frame.  Only trick there was the shield for the exhaust that I had to 
'bend' and 'unbend' to get one of the bolts in.  EV ought to have plenty 
of room for 'ground crew' and tools  and whatnot  Plus be nice enough to 
take whaere ever you want to when not cruising with the plane.  Gas 
mileage ought to be as good or better most anything else you'd consider 
for tow duty.  If you find and MV weekender you could even carry cool 
drinks in the special seat....
