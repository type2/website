On Wed, 22 Nov 1995 15:09:15 -0600 you said:
&gt;Lest we forget that fascist white males gave us the VW 60 years ago.

oh, no!!!! :)

and the same technology that destroy Nagasaka and Hiroshima cured cancers
in thousands of people and powered submarines that deterred war for many
years. same same problem of morality that Alfred Nobel had with his invention:
dynamite. which was nothing but nitroglycerin soaked in a buffer ... made it
safe enough for near-idiots to handle. he felt so bad about the military use
of the stuff that he set up the Peace Prize and all that stuff.

like Star Wars, there IS a Dark Side.

The worst part is, you never really know which side you're on ...
