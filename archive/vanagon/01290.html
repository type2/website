Subject: Re: Icebox startup time

&gt; So, I've got this '87 Camper, &quot;weekender&quot; type, with a big black fridge
&gt;bolted in behind the passenger seat.  Following the manual, I plugged 'er
&gt;into AC current, but after 45 minutes, it still wasn't very cool.  
&gt;
&gt;How long do you all find it takes for the box to really cool down?
&gt;
If I use the propane, I can feel the fins cooling after a few minutes.
Frost forms after an hour or so, depending on humidity.  The fridge takes at
least a few hours to cool.  If I use AC, I can't bother to wait to see how
long it takes to be noticeably cooler, but the fridge does not cool down
unless it stands at overnight.  By then, it's quite cool.  We won't even
discuss 12VDC, except to say that I assume that it's better than nothing.
