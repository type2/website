Martha, we were given a cool manual trash compactor. It looks like an
ordinary, stand on the pedal and the lid pops up trash can, but you lift
the lid, pop in the trash, close the lid then lift up a handle thats
intergrated into the lid and push down. A &quot;piston&quot; then pushes the trash down.

I think its Swiss, looks very european, white and red plastic.

Never thought of using in the van before now!
