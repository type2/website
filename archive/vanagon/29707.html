Subject: Re: Bruno #1 - Hidden Treasures and Big Phillips Screws

To remove large, rusty Phillips screws, I just use plenty of Liquid 
Wrench #1, then put the screwdriver to it.  Push it in hard, turn left, 
then hit the back end of the screwdriver with about a 16 oz ball peen 
hammer a few times while maintaining the torque with your other hand.  
(Don't miss!!)  this most always does it.  

You can pick up one of those &quot;hand impact drivers&quot; at most cheap tool 
stores for under $20 (or JCW has them, too).  They work pretty neat, I 
wouldn't be without one.  They come with a giant Phillips head driver.

Good Luck! :&lt;)
