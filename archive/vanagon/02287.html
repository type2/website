&gt;I'm having a terrible time figuring out how to best carry two mountain
&gt;bikes on my Westy.  There must be some great solutions to this problem
&gt;out there. The best one would still allow opening the rear hatch, and
&gt;still be able to go under low bridges.

i think i'm getting these messages out of sequence or something. but anyway.
david, the bike carriers in the german books and catalogs are aluminum
tubing affairs that grip onto the top and bottom of the rear hatch and carry
two bikes. the rear hatch can still be opened, but i don't think you'd want
to do it with the bikes ON the carrier. i think the bikes stick out a little
bit (like maybe 4-6 inches) on each side of the bus.

check with local bike shops. i think it's made over here by Rhode-Gear or
some name like that.
