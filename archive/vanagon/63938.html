I'm wondering why the Bus Boys would try to take your money, surely they
know they couldn't keep it. And I'm sure they know that screwing anyone
on the list could ruin their reputation. Maybe they had already cashed
your check, anticipating fulfilling your order. Or maybe they just needed
some money for the weekend and will return it on Monday!!
