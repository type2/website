Subject: 7 door panel...


Thom:

The term &quot;7-door panel&quot; Bus is actually something I picked up from Mr. VanBondo.
Albeit I probably mis-quoted the afore-mentioned sir.  7-door panel refers to the
double cargo-door panel Busses.  The driver and passenger front doors count as
two, the cargo doors on the right and left side of the Bus count as four more
while the rear acces hatch counts for one more for a total of 7 doors.  It is
really kinda cool to have all of the doors open.  I do think that I made a mistake
in an earlier thread by calling it a walk-thru panel.  I initially thought that
this referred to the fact that you could &quot;walk through&quot; the Bus with all of the
cargo doors open.  Upon logical reflection, I think the walk-thru panels had the
two front seats instead of the bench seat.  I am pretty sure this is right because
when someone talks about a walk-thru Kombi I know they are referring to the two
front seats.  Surely the same logic applies to the panels.... I apologize to the
list for rookie remark... I am learning though!
