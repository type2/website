     Hi All,
     
       Several people responded that it is not a safe idea to tap into a 
     propane tank.   
       I DID NOT INTEND THIS AS A DO IT YOURSELF JOB.  YOU WOULD NOT ONLY 
     NEED TO DRILL INTO THE TANK BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO WELD A BOSS ONTO THE 
     TANK BY A CERTIFIED WELDER IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK AND BE SAFE &amp; 
     LEGAL.  I WROTE THIS MAINLY TO SHOW WHAT ONE COULD DO AND IS PROBABLY 
     WHAT IS USED BY RV MANUFACTURES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  
       Now if you excuse me I will go back into DEEP lurking mode!!!!!!!!!!
     
     See Ya,
     
     Vince.

     Hi All,
     
     If you want to spend a little time and money there is a way to sense 
     the level of propane in the tank.  You can use an inductive proximity 
     sensor.  They are commercially available for around $50 depending on 
     the type needed--there a only about 500 types available from any given 
     manufacture of these devices.  Now for the hard part, you would 
     probably need to tap a hole into your tank since the sensor can not 
     sense through metal very well.  There is small chance that if the 
     liquid is as dense as water and the wall of the tank is thin you might 
     be able to get away with sensing through the wall of the tank.  The 
     other device needed would be a transformer to step the 12V DC from the 
     battery to 24V DC since most of these device run off 24V DC.  
     If any one is still interest let me know and I will research this a 
     bit more.  For me, I prefer looking at the condensation on the 
     tank--the prox. idea seems a bit overboard for the convenience 
     achieved. I would venture a guess this is the system used by the 
     campers that have such gages--no moving parts and about $100 of 
     additional cost if designed into the original equipment
     
     Regards,
     Vince.
