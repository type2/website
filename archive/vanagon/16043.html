&gt;Derek:
&gt;
&gt;I am a 2nd owner of my 83 westy with 60k miles. Am I eligible to ask VWoA
&gt;to pay the cost of repairing the head gasket problem?
&gt;
&gt;The westy is 12 years old now but with 60k miles only. I believe I have
&gt;bills from the previous owner that show the westy had the problem at about
&gt;40k miles. The dealer had attempted several repairs with no success.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.

As I understand it, VW will pay about 85--90% of the cost of repairing your 83. 

It *does not matter* whether you are the original owner or not.

It *does not matter* how old in years your car is.

It *DOES NOT MATTER* whether you already paid to have the repair done. As I
read the FTC program, it is applicable to repairs DONE IN THE PAST. 

I wonder if we hired a lawyer, and totaled up the total bill for headgasket
repair for all the people on this list (and elsewhere, for that matter),
whether that lawyer could collect a big enough sum to justify a class action
suit.

P.S. By the way, I have never had the problem myself, but I have a 87 Syncro
Vanagon motor in the tool shed and I figure I should change the gaskets
myself before putting this motor into service just in case.
