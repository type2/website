Subject: Re: Problem with Tail Lights

Johnny Stutsman said:

&gt; 	This weekend we tryed to take the '81 Westy out but the blinkers
&gt; and tail lights were not working properly.  If I turn on the tail lights
&gt; the tail lights and the blinker lights light up.  If I flip the turn
&gt; signal the tail lights and the blinker lights on both side start to flash.

Check the ground connection(s) of your taillight. Fix/clean the brown 
groundwires, the bulbholder, maybe the bulbs, and your ready to go. 

Hope it helps,

Brian.
