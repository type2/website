&gt;     Can someone tell me where they put the fuel filter in 
&gt;     my 1986 Vanagon Syncro??? I just bought this and I think
&gt;     It's never ben replaced!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     Can I get to the sending unit with out removing the gas tank??
&gt;     the fuel guage wires look like it was remove for some reason
&gt;     and never put back on. Don't answer this it you have to remove
&gt;     the transmission and the tank.

The filter should be inside the frame member beyond the left rear tire.
 Follow the hose from the fuel pump.  The bracket has to be removed to change
it.  VW says it is lifetime???  I change every 30K.  It is an anoying job to
do.  The sender is in the side of the tank, difficult, should be able to
change in place.
