Subject: Re: vanagon oil warning system


	Does this oil warning system have an electronic noisemaker that
sounds different from anything else? My Corrado made a funny electronic
noise when I was autocrossing, and I could never figure out why. (Not
that I've ever read the user's manaual cover to cover...) It only 
made the noise as I went through the start/finish line, at WAY HIGH
rpm, cornering very hard. It wasn't in a situation where I'd take
my eyes off the road, or slow down :-)
