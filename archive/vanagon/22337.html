Subject: PFTE in '71 Bus Tranny.

I am unashamed to say that I did this a few years ago.

When I got the bus I now drive from my Dad, he explained to
me some of his theories about cars. One of them was that tranny
fluid was never supposed to be changed, only topped off.

Well, Im sure that the VW engineers did not have a 20 year horizon
when they were thinking that one up! So, one day I broke down and spent
a day refurbishing the tranny. 

First, I secured a five gallon (!) bucket of 80-90 wt. (My fiance's
Dad works with huge buldozers, which take 40 gallons of 90 wt)
I warmed the tranny by taking a short trip. Then I drained the 
fluid (Always remove the top nut first!), cleaned all of the
sludge, grit, filings, sand, water, etc. from around the hole.
(Sure, NEVER change the fluid, it wont wear out WHILE THE CAR
IS UNDER WARANTEE!) I then Dumped in a half gallon of ATF.
Drove that ONCE around the block (5 mins, max), and drained it
out. It brought a couple teaspoons of crud with it. I then
dumped in a $10 bottle of Slick-50 standard tranny lube, and topped
it off with 80-90. 

After that, the shifting improved dramatically, the tranny
was noticably quieter at speed, and it stayed cooler after 
a long run. (I know about tranny temp because my starter solenoid had
caught the dredded bus disease, and I was always rolling under there
to goose it with a screwdriver.)

About a year later, I got tired of waiting 10 minutes to move in the
winter, and changed the fluid for synthetic. Shifting got even nicer,
especially in the winter (1 minute warm-up time), but I have
developed a very slow leak around the side seals.

YMMV. (Mine got about 2 MPG better)
