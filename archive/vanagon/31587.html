Wow, what a response! Sorry to those who responded, like more than 5 minutes
after the original post. Whew. 

The following manuals have been spoken for:

The Bentley Type II
The Bentley 80-83 Vanagon
The Bentley 80-91 Vanagon

I'll ask the bookstore to keep me apprised (sp?) if he gets anything new in. 

Happy Holidays
