&gt; &gt; It was at this point that I remember
&gt; &gt;someone from the list recommending using WD40 to loosen up glue when removing
&gt; &gt;stickers off windows. So I sprayed some of the glue with the WD40 and sure
&gt; &gt;enough it started to come off. I then soaked a rag with the WD40 and the rest
&gt; &gt;came off. 
&gt; 
&gt; Always remember that the Volksinstitute Fur Physiche reports:
&gt; 
&gt; Duct tape  --- Holds the universe together;
&gt; WD-40  ------- Takes the universe apart.

&gt; We are in the test phase of determining whether drywall screws are an
&gt; adequate substitute for duct tape.
&gt; 

I like to think of drywall screws as a compliment to duct tape.  They are 
just as important on their own way.  I once built an air compressor from 
an a.c. pump, small two stroke engine, a 25mph speed limit sign, 2 by 4 
scraps and a bunch of drywall screws.  The drywall screws worked well for 
holding the thing together and the duct tape plugged the holes in the 
hoses.  In this case the two were definitely not interchangable. It 
actually worked for a while till the whole smoking vibrating thing went 
on an expedition down the driveway.  shoulda secured it with more duct tape.
