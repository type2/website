Subject: pop-Top screen

Hi Gang, the screen that fits in the zippered window on the front of my
pop-top has broken-down in a number of places on my '85 Westy.  Does anyone
know of a repacement other than VolksWagen's?  Not being one to fiddle-fart
around with trying to do it myself I'm hoping that there's  something out
there as a quick fix and cheap ....sorta like the flu covers that Steve
found for us.

TIA, Bruce
