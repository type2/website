&gt;You need to discriminate between noncounterweighted HO engines, like VW,
&gt;and counterweighted HO engines, like Porsche.  For the VW engines, 4000rpm,
&gt;or right around 70 for a lot of our buses, is where my ears are calibrated
&gt;if I'm not watching the tach.
&gt;
&gt;The Porsche engine doesn't give the sense that it is straining until far
&gt;above that, and power continues to build until 5500 or more, or at least
&gt;it feels like it does.
&gt;
&gt;Any listmembers able to comment, before-and-after-wise, on a VW engine that
&gt;got an aftermarket counterweighted crank?

Able?  Well I guess so.  Qualified?  Doubtful.  For the VW valve springs,
I'd also say 4000 RPM.  If you have the counter-weighted crank and stronger
valve springs, then you can move the RPM limit up.  I still try not to
exceed 5000 or 5500 even with a CW crank and dual springs.
