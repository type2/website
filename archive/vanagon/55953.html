&gt;	As we rehash this again, isn't this the VW weekender package (I have
&gt;the above interior and no westy placards attached anywhere). I thought the
&gt;westy weekender had something like the fridge and the poptop but no
&gt;stove/sink/other cabients.

Rehash? I love rehash!! just had some for supper. 

Correct you are, there is no &quot;Westfalia-Werke&quot;placard under the kickpanel of
the backseat of the 7 pass.NON POPTOP weekender package EXEPT on the
Wolfsburg Ed. 7 pass?? (correct me if I'm wrong, Jim  :&lt;). 

And you are right, once again, The &quot;westy Weekender&quot; be it a Wolfsburg model,
or be it a Std westy - has a poptop and large fridge behind the front pass,
without the stove or sink or other cabinets.

Hmmm....I can see a &quot;Bus Plus&quot; comin' around the corner......   :&lt;)
