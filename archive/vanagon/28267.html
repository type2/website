Rusty says:
Up untill recently, Jerry Jess had been selling 14&quot; rings for $40 for 4.
They were NOS from Germany. A quick call to Jerry this AM for you confirms
that they are &quot;long gone&quot;. Jerry said that the 15&quot; rings sqeeze into the
wheel and are not the type that are held on by the hub cap. As a suggestionn
he said to go to a used hubcap place, if one exists near you, and look for
an old set of FORD rings. Jess indicates that next to no one will know the
difference depending on what you find. He had pulled this manuver on an old
Ghia. I have done the same on a '62 Ghia. Unless you need to have exactly
the right stuff this will/may work for you. 
Jerry does confirm that the 15&quot;ers are tough to find and expen$ive. The
price noted in your first post was &quot;about right&quot; for the 15&quot;ers.
Good Luck!
 
call (602)867-7672 ask for Mellissa or Jerry. They are nice folk. Tell them
that &quot;Rusty VanBondo&quot; sent cha!
