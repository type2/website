Subject: Fish Chowder Potluck (Martha and Pfeiffer people)
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 94 15:26:30 PST

Hey Marth et al,

I just talked with Bill Abbot and he mentioned a Fish Chowder
potluck that Martha apparently brought up and I missed this, but
I need to be clued in on what this is and how we're going to
accomplish this.  

Also, I'm wondering if we should move this to another mailing
list so that there rest of the vanagon group doesn't have to
wade through this stuff about the Pfeiffer trip.  I'll start
using the names that Martha posted as the trip people and 
stop using the lenti list unless there are objections?

Cheers!


Steven
