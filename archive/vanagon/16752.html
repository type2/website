So Steve Maher says:
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to differ with you on my favorite vehicle in the whole,
&gt; wide world. But I have heard from more than one source, that the
&gt; VW buses (especially the pre-80 ones) are the most dangerous
&gt; vehicles on the road.

I hate to differ with you, but... in my opinion, they are one of
the safest vehicles IMHO.  Because they are slow and humble, people
avoid getting 'stuck' behind and usually make a wide detour
around them.  I've had people pull out in front of me from side
streets, but have never felt in mortal danger.  Secondly, the
head-on business really depends on the vehicle your involved with.
Sitting high in the van actually can be safer, because of the lower
front end of a car.  The higher profile can also help you antispate
and avoid accident because you have more visibility of the traffic
ahead of you.
