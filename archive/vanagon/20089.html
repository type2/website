	Once two friends and I were driving north on highway 805 just
above the Mexican border.  We had been playing volleyball inside a
bar in Tijuana till they closed (5 am).  We were going around a gradual
left curve, in the left lane at about 65 when the right rear of the
car (a 73 Capri - my first!) dropped down to the ground.  My roomie
who was driving managed to bring the car to a halt in the median, while
the rest of us watched in dismay as the right rear wheel went careening
down the freeway, with the axle still attached and sticking out at a
right angle, defying gravity.  It never had the chance to become a road
hazard, because just as it was almost out of view two guys in a pickup
stopped, got out, threw the whole assembly in the back of their truck, and 
took off.

They saw us, and we saw them, but they were too far away for us to do
anything about it.  :(
