Subject: O2 sensors: 1-wire to replace 3-wire?

&gt;In a message dated 96-07-24 17:47:52 EDT, you write:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;, the bosch for the '87 is around $140...[snip]... price for the '85
&gt;&gt;O2 sensor is about half the price of the '87 sensor.  I assume that
&gt;&gt;there must be some difference.
&gt;
&gt;I think the pre-86 ones did not have the built-in heating element.
&gt;

Sounds right... my 86 has the 3-wire; my 84 has the 1-wire.

With that in mind, here are a few questions for those in the know:
(I checked the archives, but didn't find definitive answers to these)

1. Is it possible/practicable to use a 1-wire to replace the 3-wire?

2. Will the slower warm up time of the sensor w/out the heater be a problem?
    (i.e., do I *really* need the heated sensor for good functionality?)

3. Do both types have the same output voltage?

If I must use a 3-wire on the 86, does anyone know of a source for an
equivalent but, less expensive sensor?  [ the # on the part appears to be 0
258 001 051. ] 

Ignorantly Yours,
