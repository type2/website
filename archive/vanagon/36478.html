&gt;myself.

Erik,

Sorry, I don't have any extra poles.  I'll keep an eye out for you as
I go to swap meets starting this spring.  The ones you are looking for=20
are the heavy ones, right? (Not the ones that are shiny metal.)

BTW, where are you located?  I am near Atlanta, GA.

going to a big swap meet on the 10th in Pomona(here in Cali), I let you =
