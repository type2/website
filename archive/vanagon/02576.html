I have been thinking about doing this mod on my Bus but wasn't sure If the 
results
would be that great.  The *easy* mod would be to just swap the spindles from 
a later Bus and use the existing master cylinder/pedal setup.  The braking 
would be better
with the disc brakes but I think the *feel* wouldn't&quot;t be right since you 
wouldn't be using
the brake booster.  I also think you would have to use a proportioning valve 
to keep
the pressure balanced and not lock up one end of the car.  Probably use an 
adjustable proportioning valve like the racers do.  The discs do sound 
enticing
but I am not sure the results would be worth the expense and effort.  Anyway 
just my
thoughts and $.02.
