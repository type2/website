Subject: change the stats... for now...

Recent addition to my VW Family...this morning in fact

	1973 Westfalia Campmobile

	177K
	less than 5K on upgrade engine (2L solid lifter, with dual 
carbs..)

	spent all it's life in Idaho till it was brought East 'bout 3 
weeks ago... so almost ZERO rust.. frame looks showroom fresh!!

	it has developed carb problems...
	lack of power, low mpg, extreme tear-inducing exhaust fumes...

	the non-mechanical PO did not trust the vehicle for the trip 
back and used the cash to buy an '86 Quantum Wagon for the trip back to 
Idaho...

	
		so now collection includes:

		'64 Deluxe Sedan
		'66 Sedan (parts car)
		'68 Beetle
		'73 Campmobile Automatic
		'85 Vanagon GL ( with blown Head gaskets... again)
		'85 Audi 4000S

		and Dad's '69 KG Coupe ( out of the paint shop this 
week)



	Her Loss... My Gain...
