&gt;Having just returned, I can assure you that a Bus Village at Burning Man

&gt;of every kind and pedigree (including a stretched bus that I didn't get a
&gt;chance to look very closely at).
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Please email me if you're interested in this project and in attending
&gt;&gt;Burningman on Labor Day weekend, 1998.
&gt;
&gt;I'll be back.  Sign me up!

Bob,

I figured that a 'bus' theme would be redundant, but I wanted some 'hook'
for folks to gather around.  I figured that once I got 10 people, I'd form
a mailing list, and then ask folks to throw out village themes for
discussion.  Sound okay to you?
