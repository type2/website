Subject:      pictures of VW engine swap(no relevent VW content)

i was wondering where i could get a free homepage so that i could tell
you all about the engine swap i am going to perform in about 2 weeks.

Mr. Slavoy at D&amp;S Auto Service, INC. in Middle River, Maryland will
hopefully be helping me.
i will be doing the swap even if he declines to help me.

this is what i am planning to do.  put a chevy 2.8l v-6 into my vanagon
for extra oomph when i go off-roading and to get some acceleration on
long hills.

so if anyone could tell me where i can have my own FREE homepage, i would
be grateful.

thanks,
