&gt;
&gt;Do the plastic (that used to look like chrome) strips that are inlayed in
&gt;the window seals on my '85 Vanagon serve any useful purpose?  They have
&gt;discolored and look kind of nasty now and I'd like to just take them out.
&gt;
&gt;Will my windows fall out as a result?  Will they leak?
&gt;

Going for the Cal-look, he, Don? I have no experience with such action,
but I'd be surprised if there are any consequences: it's just a shallow
groove. However, you may find it difficult to replace the strips with new
ones (maybe aftermarket, maybe aluminum instead of plastic), once the old
ones are out.
