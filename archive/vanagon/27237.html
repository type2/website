Subject: My Tailgating Story

hey now,

i was coming home on I-40 near chapel hill, nc about 8pm last night. i was
going 61mph in the right lane. nobody was in the left lane. i had a truck come
up on me....i mean...his headlights were so close to the back of my van   i
couldn't see anything but his grill. i sped up a bit...he kept following me
close...so i dropped from 65mph to 45mph....he hung in there and flipped on his
highbeams. i drop to 35mph. he coulda passed me on the left. but he started
blaring his horn and got even closer. i swear there were only inches to spare.
my friend jill got upset with me and told me to stop getting pissed and to get
the speed up and ignore him. he pulls off at the next exit.....i was about to
go back and get his liscense plate number and all that but jill told me to
keep on driving home. i did what i was told. :P
