Subject: 93 eurovan for sale


&gt;
&gt;   if anyone is interested, there is a 93 Eurovan, automatic, 7-passenger
&gt;   (i forgot to look which model it was: ML, CL, GL) for sale at the local
&gt;   Toyota dealer. it has 58,000 miles (!?) and one big rock chip (about 1/4&quot;)
&gt;   in the windshield ... in the driver's vision. :(
&gt;
If anubody is interested, but lives too far away from Joel, the local
dealer here (Allentown, PA) also has a Eurovan.  The loaded type,
with Automatic and all power stuff, 24,000 miles.  I can also ask
the dealer how much they want for it...
