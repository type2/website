Subject: 1980 Dismantaling Last call


           To all,
        I got a call at work today. The owner of the property
        where the 1980 Vanagon is being kept said &quot;it must go&quot;.
        Anyone want anything left, this is the last call...

        Body panels are free to good home...

        Glass and many other parts are going to the scrap yard

             Anyone interested????

                  Eric
