  I'm sorry, but this is not good advice. Keep in mind that there is a 
  pushrod inside the tube and it has to be removed to get the tube out. This
  requires removal of the valve cover and rocker arm on all of the opposed
  4 cylinder VW engines, be they type I, IV or wasserboxer. The telescoping
  tubes allow a pushrod tube to be changed without removing the cylinder
  HEAD on the type I and wasserboxer. The design of the type IV engine
  allows the stock tubes to be changed without removing the engine or the
  heads. Hope this clears things up.
