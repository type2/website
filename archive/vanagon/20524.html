Subject: Re: My window won't stay fixed (fwd)

&gt;&gt;From Stuart Hutton:
&gt;&gt; The window on the driver's side won't stay fixed.  It is as simple as that.
&gt;&gt; So far, I have taken my door apart 4 times in 3 days to fix the thing, and
&gt;&gt; pretty soon, it comes apart again.  Has anyone else had this particular
&gt;&gt; frustration?  How have you fixed it?  I am considering installing metal
&gt;&gt; plates over a small square nylon guide which exist in these things
&gt;
&gt;Dr. Hutton...
&gt;
&gt; This is real freaky...My Van had blow-by...yours did. My diesel blew
&gt;up..yours did. My timing belt lost teeth, yours did. My window falls
&gt;down, yours does...
&gt;
&gt; This was the *exact* thing I wrote about this a.m.  I put out a plea
&gt;for a replacement nylon piece for my passenger side window. Now *you* 
&gt;need one for the driver's side....(oh, by the way, thats the problem...)
&gt;
&gt; Keep the window rolled up....
&gt;
&gt;Ok vanagon_at_lenti gang, anybody *else* have this problem? 
&gt;
Well, my 71 drivers side window broke the first day that I got it.  The 
little plate broke off the u shaped channel and the window fell all the way 
down into the door.  I welded it.  Thats all it took.  I don't think that 
our problems are related.
