Subject: Re: Backup halogens?


&gt;i installed a clear foglight on top of the bumper and rigged a relay and
&gt;switch on the dash. now, this method will light up the world behind you 
like
&gt;you cannot imagine. :)  like, 500 feet out behind you and way off to the
&gt;sides. you can actually SEE behind you, and can backup at about 20 mph if
&gt;you want to. and anybody behind you KNOWS you're gonna do something!!


Effective on tailgaters too.

But I still like the little-pump-squirting-diesel-into-the-carb trick--
makes the guy think his car will get dirty, which is much more important
to him than the danger he's causing.   ;^)
