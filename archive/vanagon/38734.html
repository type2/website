BINGO!  there are 2 universal joints in the steering linkage.  they 
are non-greasable and quite exposed to road grime.  the Front End 
shop in town here said that this is a common cause of on center 
stickiness and they *should* be able to match up a generic 
one once the old one is removed.

My '87 has 'sticky' steering right on center.    since the van i bought had 
sat a while before i got it i think the joints had corroded.  it does 
seem to be getting better with continual driving, in fact, it is just 
barely noticable to me now.  not enough to dig in and replace them 
for, now.

there is also a PN listing for the joint but i don't know how readily 
available it is from the dealer.
