Subject: Re: VolksWorld Subscription Info...

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; After my posting regarding the T4 syncro, I received a couple of 
&gt;&gt; requests for info on VolksWorld and VW Motoring. So here's the
&gt;&gt; info:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; VolksWorld, available from EWA  - 908 665-7814   $60/yr
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; VW Motoring is aparently available direct from the publisher in the UK...
&gt;
&gt;Are these mainly for water-cooled, or do they deal with air-cooled stuff too?
&gt;
&gt;

Volksworld is strictly air-cooled only and features both custom and classic 
cars and buses. VW Motoring features any VAG vehicles and has a lot of tests 
of new cars including SEATs and AUDIs. It is heading more and more towards 
the water-cooled side of things but still has the occassional feature on a 
*REAL* VW :-)
