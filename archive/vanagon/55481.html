Subject: exterior shower  vanagon, additional interior lighting, console, keys


Four subjects:

1.BLIND WITH NO LIGHTS    Am planning on installing additional interior
lighting, and would be interested to hear others' methods. PLan on going to
the local marine store and purchasing long 12v f lights or sliding door
area. Hard to believe with all that Westfalia engineering, we can't even
have a light when the side door opens at night! Ditto for rear hatch (round
light).


2. CONSOLE    Am planning on removing plastic shroud around dash under
middle section behind stick shift and bolt a tray there for the ubiquitous
coffee cup/console use. See any objections (besides clearance, etc.)?


3. SHOWER    Have a friend who installed an exterior shower hose, by
installing a submersible pump into the water tank. Used same ground as
what's in there now.
Ran tubing through top of tank; sealed with silicone; ran hose horizontally
through top loading storage compartments; up through hanging closet; over
top where a/c lines run, and out back. Installed an electic pump switch at
top of rear closet (using hot lead from something. Not sure what). Used a
low-flow head for pressure. To keep interior dry, used screen with snaps as
a template for a shower screen that snaps into same snaps.

Anybody else able to add pros/cons/ifs/ands/ or buts? ! ;*)  before I
started drilling holes in the bus?


4. WATER TANK    There is a small black plastic key which has the teeth
broken off, and I cannot open the water tank. Would I be damageing anything
if I were to remove the faceplate (hinged and locked) by removing the
screws?


Thanks. in advance.

Louise




(BTW, Thanks for all propane advice. I finally got the stove going, and the
fridge on 110v but not fridge on propane yet. I recently received the old
owner's files, and discovered at least 4 bills from Volkswagon dealers
around the country (lierally) with &quot;fridge unable to light&quot; as symptom.
Seems he spent about $250 or more trying to get various dealers to light
it. They apparently took it out and cleaned jets, et al. Yet, still no
luck.)


Also Thanks for all the info re: OIL SWitch On!. Turns out that one of the
wires had indeed fatigued in the replacement process on Buddy's bus.

We all finally went camping last weekend. About 10 buses. It was freezing!
Buddy ('87) made a batch of fried perch and catfish; homemade peach Cobbler
over the fire the old way wasa madw by Andy - ('82) Double Dutch Deep Apple
Pies by me ('89); homemade slaw by Caroline ('87), baked potatoes on the
fire, homemade fries, homemade fried pickles--(don't laugh till you tired
em!), Margaritas,the tall Gold way; Rupert's Special thick cut ribs;
homemade cornbread, and .well you get the picture.... We had a ball. It was
DANG cold though. Even though Rupert ('78) brought a *trailer* of wood (it
was almost a full half cord!). Really. He pulled a trailer of wood up that
mountain. Andy drove and hour and a half just to eat some of Buddy's fish,
but had to drive back because he was on a &quot;Babywatch.&quot; (Grandpa-style. His
daughter was about to give birth.) It took us about 45 minutes to get him
going after he ran down his second battery by keeping the ice cream cold
for his peach cobbler!

Going again this weekend!
