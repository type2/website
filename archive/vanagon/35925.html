Subject: Say hi to Lief (Change the stats)

Well, I bought Lief last night for $3900.  He didn't have a gas heater (no 
comments from the peanut gallery in San Diego please ;-) ) but other than 
that he is in great shape.

I got the insurance company to tow Fritz to The Bug Shop so that I could get 
my new snow tires off.  But the insurance adjuster said that as long as it 
has 4 tires on it when they come to pick it up to bring it back to the 
salvage yard, they'e happy.

So I switched the back seat and bed (both buses are green) and the glove box 
door (latch was missing on Lief) and one of the curtains.

Also the bug shop is taking the gas heater out of Fritz and putting it into 
Lief.  This means I'll have a bus in mint condition that I can even drive to 
Whistler.

So about the stats... I don't think Fritz was included in the stats since I 
kind of discretely joined the list when I bought him.  But Lief is a 1977 
Westfalia.

I'd been so lucky lately that I bought a few 6/49 tickets (Canada's big 
lottery) for last nights draw.  But no luck.  I guess it had to stop 
somewhere.  Although I did win 2 Blackcomb lift tickets last night when they 
showed me on the 6pm news ($98 value).
