Good.  Vdo makes a sender that has two terminals on it... one for the
gauge and one for the stock idiot light.

&gt; The parts guy there says that we need both oil temp and pressure, but
&gt; I'm not so sure.  I guess I remember {David?} saying something about
&gt; oil pressure first, oil temp second, and head temp last.  Any other
&gt; opinions?  

That wasn't me, but I agree wholeheartedly.

&gt; And what about the installation?  I can see that putting a
&gt; straight pipe adapter in place would be a good idea, but where do you
&gt; obtain this so called adapter? Finally, how about a TEE or even three
&gt; way tee adapter to connect to the oil press guage, idiot light, and
&gt; oil temp guage?

First of all, the dual sender does not require the adapter.  There is enough
room to screw it in without modifying anything.  Tightening it is impossible
unless you have the tin removed, though...

Second, you can't connect the oil temp gauge in the same place as the
oil pressure gauge.  You need to put that one in the sump.  Not the
best place for it, but it's either that or drill into the journals.
