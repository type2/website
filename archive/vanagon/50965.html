Subject: 87 westy clutch pedal squeak

  hi all,
        me and my 87 westy were wondering if anyone out there had
successfully delt with ther squeaky clutch pedal?  i think theres a nylon
bearing sleave thats worn out (122k), but access looks bleak.  i can barely
see what im trying to get at much less get my hands near it..;(
        i had the dash apart last week (to free a seized blower fan),,,now im
thinking i have to do that again to get at the clutch/brake pedal assembly!
;(((   i'll try spraying the area with heavy duty lube, but im gonna need to
fix it right real soon.  any thoughts?

                                    peace
