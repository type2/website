Subject: RE: syncro uneven tire wear? 

Maybe this tire was not put on the bus at the same time as the others?

Is it the same brand name, design and size as the others?

What did the current owner say about this?

Was the wear even across the tread, or mostly on one part of the tread as you look across 
it?

&gt;Hey folks
&gt;	I was looking at a possible syncro purchase and it had one tire that was worn
&gt;a lot more that the rest.  The passenger front tire had a lot less tread
&gt;overall and even more wear on the outside edge.   The rest of the tires have
&gt;very little wear on them (less that 10,000 mi).  The tires don't seem to be the
&gt;right size either, they are 205/something r14.  I checked on the door frame and
&gt;they were not listed there.   Any ideas how serious this is?  Thanks for your
&gt;time, all your help has been great.
