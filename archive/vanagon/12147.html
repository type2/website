Subject: Re: A question of Smell

&gt;
&gt;During spirited cornering, I can smell gas comig through my
&gt;heater vents.  I am quite certain this is somehow bad.  Where
&gt;can a gas smell come from?  Could it somehow be related to my
&gt;wonderous 12 mpg or do I have two quandries to contemplate?
&gt;

Depending on your attachment to the van, it could be bad. On the other hand, 
if you are over-insured, have large repair bills to cover, have your eye on 
a new van........  

Sounds like a really rusty gas tank! Or missing plumbing / pipes. You should 
check it out, it may well explain the 12 mpg. Vapourized gas, boiled off 
from the heat exchangers, reaching the front of your bus is scarey. That 
could be an amazing explosion if it all caught at once. tim s.
