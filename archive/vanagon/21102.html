Subject: Re:Running wires.

I solved the running of wires problem a long time ago.
I ran a shielded, armor plated length of 25 conductor serial cable
from the back to front.

It is great for sensors, as they require almost no power to flow.

When I need to send more than 200mA, I twist some wires together.

(I had some lying around, but it is not expensive, and you do the job
once, and are done with it. I still have 8 conductors free)
