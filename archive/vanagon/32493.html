&gt;Does anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets neet to 
&gt;be 
&gt;changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if necessary) be had?

&gt;I have had a set of the halogen bulbs in my '71 for a couple of years. Lots of 
&gt;light in the right spot a night. I picked them up a a local Pep Boys. They 
&gt;just [plug in to the standard socket.

I saw them at Pep Boys on Monday, $14.95 pr. Kind of steep. I will 
look around some more.
Has anybody used these lights other than backup lights?
I was thinking of putting some in my conering lights on my Trooper and 
maybe the worklight under the hood of my Jeep.  

My Father has been using the same set for the past 12 years. He is 
on the 3rd car. I think he is sold on them.
