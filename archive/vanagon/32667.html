Nice one Lee! Yes I think I can access Corel Draw, but it depends which
version, I had some problems with some filew from Germany. Can I have hard
copy as well. I love this Splitty Nation, now to trawl the Register for an
articlw with the new logo - will we shift the inertia? Still, nw name etc..
See you soon. Dave
