Subject: 78 Timing Marks?
Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 21:29:34 -0700

I have a question concerning the timing marks on my 78 Engine. There are
two different marks, or grooves on the pulley, one on the front of the
pulley (closest to the front of the car), and the rear half of the pulley
also has a mark. Which one should I use to time to? They are about 4 inches
away from each other. Thanks for the info!   Tom
