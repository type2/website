Subject: '89 Westy Camper $8500

The guy wants $8500 for this. He says it's in top shape with camper, etc. 
He's had it for one year and said all he's had to do was change the oil.
He's also got a '64 bus. If anyone decides to call, his name is Flint. 

If I had the wherewithall, I might consider this one, especially since 
Edmund's says it's estimated worth is 10575 Wholesale, 12725 Retail:

VANAGON 1989                  BaseLst   Whlse     Retail

&gt;stove, sink, sleeps four. Call 444-7089. (that's area code 501)
