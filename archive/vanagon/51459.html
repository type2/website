Subject: Re: What is a Westy Weekender?

&gt;| My understanding is the Weekender is a GL with a fold down back seat
&gt;| that makes a queen size bed.  It's not a Westy.

	That would describe my weekender with one exception. There is
this little heat exchanger type thing under the back set and to the
left of the water driven rear heater (left is left facing front). When I
bought the thing a few weeks ago, the PO did not have the original owners
manual but handed me a propane regulator with some hosing and those little
brass fittings and told me it went with the car (though I cannot seem
to find anything that will take the fitting). Does anyone know what this
heat exchanger type thing is? It looks stock (well, installed by someone
other than the PO who seemed to be a take-it-to-the-shop kind of guy).
