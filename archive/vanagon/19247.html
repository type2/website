&gt; Attention to detail.  Thoroughness.  Persistence.  These are
&gt; qualities rarely found in dealership mechanics.  If you find a
&gt; mechanic with those qualities, pay him willingly and cheerfully.  As
&gt; can be read from many of our posts, we get better service
&gt; (sometimes) by checking things out ourselves.  Be a geek.  Buy books
&gt; and read.  Talk geek talk with other gearheads.  Gawd I love this
&gt; list.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a tip for finding some of those irrascable air leaks in the
&gt; intake system, unfortunately, this requires an aircompressor with a
&gt; regulated output:
&gt; 
&gt; -pull off the air flow meter at the rubber boot (just loosen the hose
&gt; clamp)
&gt; -replace airflow meter with a rubber ball to seal the large opening;
&gt; if I remember, tennis or raquetballs work
&gt; -place nozzle of air gun in just about any vacuum line hose, I use a
&gt; piece of small diameter copper tubing on the end of my airgun for
&gt; blowing debris and sticking in orfices (shut-up Steve)
&gt; -regulate air pressure to a few psi or a little higher, one doesn't
&gt; need much
&gt; -mix up a soap-water solution and use a soft paintbrush to slather
&gt; all over the intake system; air leaks will foam like crazy!  listen
&gt; for leaks too.
&gt; -you may have to rotate the crankshaft soemwhat to get the right
&gt; position to seal the combustion chambers
&gt; 
&gt; I've found that the fabric connectors on the maniforld really leak at
&gt; the crimp type hose clamps.  Replace them with screw type.  Also,
&gt; breather tubes seem to leak right at the big boot.
