Subject: Type2 alias addresses broken...


The alias addresses for the type2 list that end in _at_type2_dot_com seem to be
broken. They did work up until today as far as I know. Working on it, use
the real addresses until further notice.

 My old address, bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net, will stop working soon. Please note
                                the new one.
