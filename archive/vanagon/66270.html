&gt;Blake, I own this same unit and other than some initial installation problems
&gt;I've been very happy with its performance.

 we splurged for a solar

Clark, thanks for all the info.   i was off the list for a few wks this
summer, so don't know if you've discussed this already  --- would you be
willing to share some info on your solar panel, where you got it, who/how
installed, costs, etc.?  Also, is there a place to look up the Platinum Cat
and Propex heaters?

TIA,
Gail
