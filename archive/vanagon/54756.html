&gt; A little while ago, my clutch slave cylinder failed and due to the

&gt; actually making it there without having to stop (or shift).  I 
&gt; mentioned this to some people I work with and a few mentioned they 
&gt; &quot;knew people&quot; (don't they always?) who shifted their manual trannys 
&gt; without using the clutch just by cranking over in gear and just jamming 
&gt; the lever in for the upshifts.

    It's easier then you may think. I drove a car home across 3 state
    with no clutch. Start it in 1st gear. When ready to shift, apply
    a constant GENTILE presser to the shifter and let off the gas.
    It will come right out of gear, and jump right into the next gear
    as the RPM's of the motor fall thru the speed of the next gear. The
    only problem is stopping. As you approtch a stop, make sure you
    pull it out of gear before the RPM's drop. If you  don't there is
    no other way to stop other then turning off the motor!

                    Good luck Eric Zeno
