Subject: Re: (FFFFriday): another pome. :)

HEY MAN!
That pome was beautiful!  Glorious seeing you this past week...short hair
and all.  10 days to Johnny Acetone (That's AYCE-TONE...not ASS-I-TONE).
Hooty Hoo!  Make sure Gorge mails that letter to me so that I may know
what his plans for the future are.  I'm bursting with curiosity.  Y'all
torture me unMERCIFUL!  JESUS GOD AND BABY JESUS HELP US!
Sure!
Fantastic!
I'm Sorry...
Thank you.
Love, S.
