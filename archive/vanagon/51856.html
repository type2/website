&lt;&lt;into a smaller town and pretty much wipes out the local mom-and-pop stores
&lt;&lt;that had been there for years ... so much for American Values.

I know it isn't Friday, but I couldn't resist

Yup, they disguise it under the pretense of market forces, economic 
development, community building, and making products more affordable.  After 
Wal-Mart puts the mom-and-pop stores out of business they leave many members 
of the small communities with no other viable employment options, so they're 
forced to go work at Wal-Mart.  Now, here's the really bogus thing - on 
several occassions, Wal-Mart has gone into communities - set up shop - 
maintained operations for a year or two - decided it wasn't profitable - and 
shut up shop, thus, leaving a majority of the population without work and 
without a location to purchase necessities.  So, the people are forced to 
drive 40 miles to the next Wal-Mart.

Crazy

There's a guy (somewhere) spearheading a national campaign to stop 
Wal-Mart's expantion.
