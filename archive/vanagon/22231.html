&gt; FLAPS.  He said what I needed was hydraulic line hose.  This comes in 
&gt; the size I need and is metal reinforced.  $3/ft.  Is this what we are 
&gt; after?  I haven't measured mine but this sure seems cheaper than the 
&gt; nearly $200 somebody said the dealer wanted for this thing.  Anybody 
&gt; else running some different with any success?  I am thinking this is 
&gt; what I will use to replace mine.  Thanks, Jim

I am running hydraulic hose for the vacuum booster on two of my vans.  It 
works great.  It is really designed for pressure, but it seems to hold up 
fine with the miniscule vacuum it faces.  I was originally worried about 
fuel (gasoline) deterioration, but so far so good.  er a that is I have 
tested the hose for fuel deterioration by sticking my finger into the 
hose and trying to did my fingernail into a softened lining.  My finger 
always come out clean and eyeball visual inspection showns not cracking or 
other imperfections.
