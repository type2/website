Subject: re: passing and VW's

I think it's psychological.  If it has VW on it, you gotta pass it!

Here is the scenario, I'm crusing up I-95 around 75-80mph.  I come upon a 
&quot;family sedan&quot; running about 70mph, I pass and continue on my happy way.

All of a sudden, family sedan is doing 85mph, passes me, pulls in front 
of me and promptly brings it back down to 70mph.

&gt;From there on, round and round we go.

Does this sound familiar?
