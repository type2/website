Subject: Best VW Meet Awards (F)

OK, I haven't thrown anything out for a Friday for a while, so....

What are the best/funniest/most bizarre VW meet awards people have 
seem/heard about/fantisized about?  You know, every meet seems to have 
awards for stuff like 

&quot;Longest distance driven&quot;
&quot;Best restoration&quot;
&quot;Most in need of restoration&quot;
&quot;Interior remodelling most likely done under influence of really weird drugs&quot;
&quot;Most impressive display of ground clearance&quot;
&quot;Most times dropping engine during meet&quot;

You get the idea.  Please indicate whether your nomination is a verified 
award, a &quot;heard about&quot; award, or a &quot;fantasy&quot; award.  Winner gets a &quot;Best 
Award&quot; award.

Happy Friday!

Tobin
