Subject: Rebuilding EGR valves?
Date: Fri, 19 Apr 96 9:53:01 PDT

In earlier correspondence on the Vanagon list was an oblique reference to
rebuilding EGR valves.  I believe someone stated that they recall a posting
about someplace (maybe in S. Cal.) that rebuilds EGR valves. I have searched
the archives and could not find the alleged posting.  

Does anyone know if there exists an outfit which rebuilds EGR valves?
