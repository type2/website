&gt; Would anyone care to flesh out this idea?

 I think it's a great idea, but I don't think it's fair to limit it to
 old buses. My perception, based only on what I've learned from this wonderful
 list, is that that the newer buses are just as likely to need a helping
 hand as the old ones. Of course  I'd be useless as a contributor there
 &lt;whatsa water pump???&gt; but there must be some folks who could chip in.
