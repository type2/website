Bob,
Thanks so much for the information.  I'm a little baffled and frustrated, 
though, because the problem is that it appears that the #1 bearing is 
actually MOVING in and out.  If I shim the thing, it tightens up on the 
bearing, because I'm shimming the wrong thing.  How can the bearing be 
loose in there? Is that even possible?

&gt; When you next overhaul the engine, one of your pre-assembly steps whould be
&gt; to verify the end-play to insure your bearing's thrust face is thick enough
&gt; to give you the required clearance.

Help me out here.  What &quot;clearance&quot; are you referring to?

I'm going to CC the list because I want to hear more about this.
Thanks!
