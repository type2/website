Subject: EV propane filling?

Actually I did run into  one other glitch with the EV Camper - the propane
fill valve is angled down pretty far. The local propane source couldnt hook
their nozzle up until I drove up over a curb to provide him additional
clearance!
I know I heard someone else complaining about this before, but that was
awhile ago. Have you come up with a fix or are you just living with it?
