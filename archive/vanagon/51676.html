Subject: rear hatch struts needed
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 96 12:39:33 EST

Hey all,
My '81 Vanagon needs new rear hatch struts.  I know to beware of
Suspander brand.  I though I was gonna score some struts from a local
FLAPS at $20 each (not Suspander) but turns out the warehouse doesn't
have them in stock.  Pep Boys doesn't have them, contrary to what their
advertising may sugges, and Super Trak Auto doesn't have them either.  

So, does anyone know where I can get some good struts for less than $43
each?  I was looking through the parts suppliers list that Joel gave me
and I noticed a company which has the pair for $67.  Are these the good
ones or are they Suspander?

WCM has 'em but they're like $45 each plus shipping.  

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Sean
