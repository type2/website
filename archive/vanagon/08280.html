&gt; My experience is that cars without names feel unloved and take it out on the
&gt; owner in lemon-like behavior.  Mine Vgon is the Toy Box.  Says so right on it.
Oh!  Now I know what I've been doing wrong!  Yep, I work on it ... making sure
that the oil gets changed and then other oils that I'd never think of get
changed and clean it (the rear) and clean it (the rear) and clean it (the
rear).  Gosh!  I never named the thing!  That's why, right after cleaning,
the vanagon will always spray oil out again and make me clean it's rear.
