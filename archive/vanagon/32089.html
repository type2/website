Subject: Alternator Bearings (90 Amp)

The bearings in the alternator of the '87 Syncro seem to be telling that that
they are not much longer for this world.  VW wants $285 (before 15% discount)
for one and FLAPS wants $149 (before 10% discount).  I had just replaced the
brush/regulator in this a month ago.  My question is:  Are bearings available
for the 90 amp alternator.  I'm being told &quot;no&quot; here.  Anybody else had any
luck getting these bearings?
