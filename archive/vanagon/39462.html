Subject: RE: AAA Info Request


Ah, what the hell, let me throw my $.02 worth in....(don't I always??  =
;-)  )

I have been a member of AAA for over 25 years....and although I do not =
agree with their &quot;political stands&quot;, their road and trip service has =
helped me numerous times. They've towed my cars to garages, regardless =
of age of car, or regardless of whose garage it was (dealer, mine, etc) =
with the AAA plus option...

My wife and I were T-boned in New Jersey a couple of years back, she =
suffered back injuries and a concussion. The car was totaled. AAAs trip =
protection benefit not only got us a night in a hotel, but got us on an =
Amtrack Club Car (doctor said wife needed to be in a comfortable seat on =
the way home) from Newark to Prov RI....

For what I pay them each year, I've more than made up for it in maps, =
guide books, reduced price tickets for Disney, movies, etc....
