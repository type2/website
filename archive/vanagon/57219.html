Subject: 84 vanagon running hot
Date: Sat, 15 Mar 97 12:07:44 PST

To whom it may concern,
     I was wondering how to post a question to be answered on your 
mailing list. I 've  got quite the dilema with my 84 vanagon. The motor 
was recently rebuilt and a new radiator installed. It still runs hotter than 
it did for the 65,000 miles of problem free driving I had before its rebuild. 
 I can't get any definate answers regarding my &quot;hot&quot; topic . Can 
anyone help?

Thank You!

Alexander
