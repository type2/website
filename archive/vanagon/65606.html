          I install 12V fans inside my refrigerator and was just going to
          wire it to the vehicle with a switch somewhere so I can turn it

          that I could wire the fans to so that they would go on when the
          fridge is in use? I looked at the wiring diagram and I did not
          see any way to do this. But perhaps someone out there more
          skilled at reading wiring diagrams might see something I missed.

     Todd-

     Speaking from a late-model ('91 Westfalia - Dometic 182B?) standpoint,
     I'd have to say, no.  There doesn't seem to be a common circuit
     through the mode-selector that would allow one to wire the fans to
     only have power when the fridge is on.

     For a high tech approach, it should be possible to add a relay to EACH
     mode's connections, thereby providing a source of switched power for
     the fans.  This would be a fairly involved process, especially for
     anyone not versed in DC power (and probably AC come to think of it -
     you've got 110V to consider, too).

     I installed a flush-mount rocker switch in the Dometic face plate
     (right where the logo was) to control the fan circuits (and a panel
     mount fuse holder and 2A fuse to protect the fans) - 'course now I
     have to remember to switch this off as well.  But at least now the fan
     doesn't run just because the car is parked in the sun.
