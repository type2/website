&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The origin of the term is unclear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I thought it was because the pistons' movements are reminiscent of the
&gt; &gt;fists of two boxers pounding each other. &lt;?&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I saw that idea in a magazine review... sounds contrived and farfetched,
&gt; to say the least. The word comes from the German language, doesn't it?
&gt; Probably bears no resemblence to the English definition...

...well, in this case, the meaning of &quot;boxer&quot; &lt;english&gt; = &quot;boxer&quot; &lt;german&gt;.
Being german, I've always kinda pictured four little MAX SCHMELING's battling
it out in there...
