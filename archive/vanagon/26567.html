&gt;(stop me if I'm being too specific)
&gt;	Anyway, SAE is always advertising a Bosch Automotive

&gt;	Has anyone seen either of these? I've been tempted to
&gt;buy them, but would like to hear from someone that has them,or
&gt;has seen them as to their general usefullness.
&gt;(it also just occurs to me that I should check the libraries around

I found the Bosch Fuel Injection book quite helpful in debugging my FI system.
I now know more about FI than I ever wanted to know plus I got my FI system
working again.  IMHO it is worth its money.
