&gt;        I am thinking about eventually putting H4's on my bus, when I convert
&gt;        Has anyone put these on a VW, especially a bus?

i run Cibie Z-Beams on my bus (yes, i KNOW they are round. i converted. :)
and love them. i've run them on every bus since about 1973 ... much better
lighting than the older sealed beam.  and, like Ric says, a much better
cut-off on the pattern (mine lights up the side of the road really well, but
doesn't shine into the eyes of the oncoming drivers).

now, as to the 911: Bosch makes some direct 90w replacements for the 911.
you can check the porsche mags for these. Hella also makes some (i think).

as to the 100w replacements, ... well, in the 911, the wiring is already
there, but i'm not soooo sure about the buses.  i know a fellow in bham who
works on 911's and he's run those bosch lights for at least 20 years on his
cars. it's not so bad when he's on dim, but it'll burn the hairs on the back
of your neck if he's behind you and flips on his brights! :)

most of the H4 lighting that you get can be very very easily swapped into
the vw lighting. except for the 86-91 vanagons (and likely, the eurovans).
the square headlights of 86-91 are NOT found anywhere (that i looked) other
than the dealer. and they are expen$ive. bulbs aren't so bad, but the glass
is ridiculous.

ramble, ramble, ramble. anyway, i say: go for it. it's better lighting than
the old GE sealed beams. but clean up your wiring, too ... so you'll get the
best results.
