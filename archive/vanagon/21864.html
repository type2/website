Subject: more '89 saga (A/C)

Well, they didn't replace the *entire* A/C system. New switches, new
compressor, new in-line 3A fuse for the compressor clutch.

First day: fuse blows.  I looked throughout the Bentley manual and their is
no mention of this fuse.  Was their a tech bulletin about a fuse on the A/C
clutch? I don't remember seeing one...  Any idea what that clutch should
draw?

There is also an ongoing smell of evaporated/heated ethylene glycol.  I
can't find a leak (external).  Does an internal head-gasket leak produce
this smell?  (I'm still relatively new to water-cooled maintenance).  The
coolant level has stayed steady through one whole day of operation :-)

Sidebar: the area Super K-Mart carries several brands of anti-freeze.  The
lowest priced of them is some forgettable in-house name, but it says boldly
(paraphrase) 'compatible with aluminum parts'.  The contents list only
ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol (with percentages).  I checked the
other brands and they mentioned phosphates and &quot;proprietary&quot; compounds.
Any guesses as to whether this would be a less expensive alternative to the
AutoBahn product?
