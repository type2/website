Subject: unplug '86 idle stabilizer?
Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 13:47:28 -0400

Hi Volks,

I've been following the high and wandering idle thread(s) of late as I have
been suffering the same malady. After trying all the suggestions to no
avail, I finally unplugged the idle stabilizer today and, TADA! The idle is
steady at about 800 rpm, even in park and neutral!

So my question is, is it ok to leave it unplugged? Will it affect anything?
Gas mileage, etc? Considering it's a &gt;$200 part, that would be nice but it
seems all to easy a solution.

Enjoying the oblivion,

tony
