Subject: '76 2.0L FI.....For Sale


It's time to unload my '76 Bus.  I need the space in front of 
the house.  I bought the soldier from a good friend for $500.
That is price I'm selling it for.  I have put over $500 into in
the last 3 months.... new alternator, new muffler, new cat. conv.,
new dome light,  I spent some cash to get it smogged last month,
so the buyer will not have to deal with it.  The compression and
power on the Bus are still good... it's averaging 20mpg.

If anyone is interested e-mail me back at the office:

David
