In a message dated 95-06-20 12:05:14 EDT, you write:

&gt;I just replaced my clutch master cylinder and bled the system about two 
&gt;weeks ago.  If fluid's &quot;spraying&quot; out I think the master must be OK.  I know

&gt;it did take a LOT of pumping though.  First no air, then lots of air, then 
&gt;(finally) clean fluid again.  Had to top up the reservior several times.  
&gt;
&gt;Good luck.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, Kirk mentions replacing seals in these cylinders.  When I did mine, I 
&gt;was told you can't buy these seals anymore - had to buy a new cylinder (or 
&gt;used).  Anyone know if there's still a source for these?  Kirk?
&gt;In case my slave goes next :)

When I had to replace my cylinders, both master and slave, I was also told I
had to buy the complete cylinders, as the seals were unavailable.
