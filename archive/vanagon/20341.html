Subject: VanagonWesty Tires (again)

After a four lane, rush hour blow out yesterday Rusty (humbly for once) asks:

I have a couple of tire questions beyond the scope of the previous threads.
I have checked on the Michellin XC4S 185 R 14, the Goodyear HT and the
Yokahama Y356 choices. No one seems to know about the availablity of the
Michellin XZX 185/70 SR 14&quot;.

*My Question*
I have a chance to pick up a set (4) of Bridgestone 185 SR 14 ST &quot;D&quot; tires.
I understand that the &quot;C&quot; load range is a 6ply tire and the &quot;D&quot; is an 8ply
tire. Do the tire gurus on the list think that the 8ply &quot;D&quot;s will ride like
a truck or in general be undesireable?

I need quick advice on this one. Please resond if you have definite
knowledge or experiences/advice.
