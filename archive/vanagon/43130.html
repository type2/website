Subject: Re: Freezing Propane?


Alright, alright.  I know i'm off the list but one last message 
before the listserv unsubscribe takes effect.

The originator of this post wonder why his fridge went out on 
freezing nights....

Well, the moisture from the burning propane contains alot of water 
vapor-- and the heat output from the fridge flame is not sufficient 
to keep the vent warm so the vapor freezes and snuffs out the flame.  
or just alot of moisture condenses in the vent tubes and drips back 
down onto the flame extinguishing it.  it's happened to me several 
times.  not sure what to do about for a cure....

you *could* have water in your propane tank which can be flushed out 
with a methanol rinse from a propane service company but this is less 
likely your problem.

okay, i'll go now.  bye.
