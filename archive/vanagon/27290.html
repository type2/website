Excerpts from audi: 23-Oct-95 Re: Engine transplant by &quot;Harvey

&gt; Regarding Audi 5 cyl. engines in Vanagons - 
&gt;  
&gt; As a Diesel Vanagon owner, I'm always interested in alternatives - four that
&gt; come to mind are:
&gt; 1)  Replace with same (done that once)
&gt; 2)  Replace with rumored 1.9 or 2 L version 4 cyl Diesel (same tranny
&gt; interface ?)
&gt; 3)  Repalce with new TDI Diesel (same tranny interface?)
I'm sure it would be impossible to find a TDI VW engine.  I'm not even
sure if they have been imported yet to the US.  They were supposed to be
here last Sept. 1st, but I don't think that they materialized.
&gt; 4)  New - Replace with 5 cyl  Audi Diesel or Gas (but will if  fit?)
I used to own an Audi 5000 Diesel, but I threw it away last summer(it
tried to kill me.  I was driving down I-89 about 10 feet from the VT/NH
border when one of the inner tie rod ends decided to unbolt itself from
the steering rack)

I have no idea whether the engine will bolt up to the transmission. 
However, I do know that 2wd Audi 4000's came with 4 cylinders(very
similar to a GTI motor) while 2wd Audi Coupe GT's came with 5 cylinder
motors.  Someone on the Audi Quattro list(quattro_at_coimbra.ans_dot_net) would
know the answer to this question.  
&gt;  
&gt; So - Any of you that hear about these kinds of engine swaps - I'd love
to hear
