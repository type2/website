Subject:      Need Advice Buying a Westy

I'm new to this and know almost nothing about the world of Vanagon
Westys except that after 1985 they are water cooled and some of 'em were
not done in Germany.  Anyway, I would welcome buying tips as my wife and
I prepare to join this club (do I need to be a mechanic, for
instance?).  Also, how come I see so many 1987's for sale?  Something
wrong with that year?

-Gratefully,
