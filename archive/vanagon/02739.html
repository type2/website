Subject: Re: Alloy Wheels

&gt;&gt; I'd like to get a set of alloy wheels for my '87 Syncro. Called the nearest
&gt;&gt; dealership and was quoted a price of nearly $400 a wheel.
&gt;
&gt; Whee, bet they sell a lot of those.
&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt;lots of stuff from William W. deleted&gt;&gt;&gt;


Ford Scorpio/Granada and Audi 200 Turbo wheels fit. I've tried BMW wheels, 
they're just a gnat's off. Porsche alloys don't fit either. I know you don't 
have Granadas over there but there must be an equivalent Ford model (Centaur 
or something??) with 5 stud, 110mm PCD wheels that would be a cheap 
secondhand wheel doner. I don't know about the Volvo wheels but I have seen 
a few Volvos with tasty wheels and some with what looked like aftermarket 
Merc' alloys so there is a good chance they will fit. Mercedes and Audi 
wheels (and probably some of the others) need to have the central hole 
opened up slightly to clear the hub nut. If you don't have access to a lathe 
you can still do this youself since its close to the centre and will have a 
negligable effect on the wheel's balance.
