So Mark McCulley says:
&gt; There's an old bus I've seen several times out on the Olympic Penisula with
&gt; the tag &quot;GOGH VAN&quot;.
&gt; 

While driving home from Santa Clara to Sacramento last weekend (Saturday afternoon)
I passed a '80 or '81 eggnog/primered Vanagon that had a sticker in the window that
said &quot;Eat More Possum&quot;.  Thought it might be one of Joel's remote ken folk.  :)
