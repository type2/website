Subject: W Coast Pre-tour mini-caravan?

For all the Pfeiffer folks from (or who will be passing through) the Bay 
Area on the way to the meet:

How about &quot;caravaning&quot; down to the site from somewhere in the bay Area?  
Probably someplace at the South end of the bay would be a good meeting 
place, so's folks from both East bay and the penninsula can get there 
without going out of the way.

Catch #1: I don't take my camper much over 55, 'cause I don't want to 
make it tired: it has to get us almost to Guatamala, to the Maritimes, 
and back, so I'm going to be fostering a good working relationship.  I 
don't push too hard, camper doesn't blow motor in Chiapas.  So it'll be a 
little slower than some of you might be used to.

Catch #2: I can't organize this (convenient, huh?) on accounta I'll be on 
the road on the way down, and besides, I don't know the area well enough 
to suggest a good meeting place.

I'm thinking a mid-afternoon (1 - 2 pm?) meet for the drive down would be 
good, some of you poor folks still have jobs, so maybe that's too early?

Just thought I'd throw the idea into the ring...

Tobin
