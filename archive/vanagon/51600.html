Subject: re: Fuel pump prices ('80-early '83) Phx,AZ

Rheu032_at_uabdpo.dpo.uab_dot_edu (Charles R. Roberts) wrote about fuel pump
prices. I also have been having &quot;joy&quot; with this part. I have found that the
prices vary widely!!!!

Prices in Phoenix, AZ:
Dealer (Chapman):$278.53 &quot;Would have to order it!&quot;
BAP: $109. rebuilt $190. new. &lt;Bosch&gt; $41. +/- core
Autohaus:$70.00 rebuilt $130 new. &lt;Bosch&gt; $41. +/- core

It pays to shop. I know that several of the most popular VW FLAPS in Phoenix
order from the Autohaus. When they say &quot;Warehouse&quot;, they usually mean
Autohaus. We are talking about a $143.53 difference when comparing new Bosch
to new Bosch! The only difference is a different part of town. &lt; ;-) &gt;

BTW: This past weekend I cheaped out and bought the rebuilt with a 12/12,000
guarantee on it and it buzzes as bad as the old one that got replaced. I
will switch it out again next weekend. If it were going into the &quot;keeper&quot;
Vanagon Westy, I definitely would have gone with the new one.
