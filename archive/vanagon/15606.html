Subject: neat vw brochure at dealer


I was just in at my local VW dealer yesterday, and picked up
a brochure which might interest some of you.  It's called 
&quot;Volkswagen in America: Chronical of a Car Company,&quot; and is put
out in honor of VW's 40th anniversary celebration.  Inside, it 
gives an interesting synopsis of Vw's history for the various
decades, and outside, there's a lovel picture of all different
makes/models/years of different VWs.  The dealer has a poster
of this same picture enlared and hung on the entry door.  Don't
know whether the poster is available to the public, but the
brochure itself functions as a small version of that.
