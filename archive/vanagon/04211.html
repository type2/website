Yep.  About as well as any other gas gauge I've seen.  Full is full, 
half is half, and when it gets to the left and stops moving... I need 
gas. 

&gt; Hey Bradley it's not that I don't believe you, it's that
&gt; my Delux Micro Bus wouldn't look neat in a kind of charcoal
&gt; black color scheme. Coz I figure that if you double the volts
&gt; then you double the current as well - gulp.

Well... I did it about 3 1/5 years ago, and no fires yet.  Hell... even 
the 6V wipers still work (anyone have 12V ones froma '67?). It's a good 
thing it doesn't rain here alot. :)  
The way I see it the gauge measure resistance.  So the voltage doesn't 
make a big difference.

&gt; My solution is to make a 12-6V dc-dc converter to power up
&gt; the fuel gauge system (and the clock). But hey since Bradley
&gt; hasn't had fried gauge for breakfast yet then I'll go with
&gt; his knowledge.

I think it's entirely safe.  I've got over 20,000 mile on it in that 
state, and no problems.

Oh, and if you need a 12V flywheel for a 6V engine... I have one for 
sale.  :)
