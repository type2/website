&gt; There's a guy with a web page who installed a water cooled toyota motor
&gt; into a breadloaf westy. It's painted like a cow, pretty wild. I can't
&gt; remember the url but he goes into some detail of the transplant on his
&gt; page.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; 
There's a link to his homepage on my links page:
