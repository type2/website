Subject:      Limited Slip Differentials (LSD), lineage and all that stuff ...

but wasn't the vw bus the vehicle that allowed the hippies to be?
what other vehicle could possibly have provided such an anti-establishment
attitude? an edsel? not likely. every other van-type vehicle was a product
of 'The Establishment' (Ford, GM, Chrysler), and VW was the only non-hype
advertising company around. without the vw bus, the hippie movement would
have fizzled (imho). :)  even the beetle, from the same company, wasn't
able to allow such 'living': it was very difficult to sleep inside a beetle.

now, as to the drugs: well, wasn't the bus itself a addiction? and driving
was just a trip, getting high, getting by, and getting strange? :) after
all, if you didn't like to drive, you certainly wouldn't be driving a vw bus!
(that's what chevrolet's are for: people who don't like to drive).

and the peace movement? well, hell ... you had to be peaceful if you drove
a vw bus: you had NO crash protection, NO power to pass, NO brakes to speak
of, and you stuck out in traffic like a big sore thumb ... there was no way
you could run from police/rednecks/problems; there was no way you could hide
the thing.

so, you might look at the Volkswagen Microbus/Bus as THE CAUSE of the whole
Peace and Hippie Movement! yeah, that's it! Volkswagen entered into a
conspiracy with all the ex-Nazi's left in the world ... it was their intent
to destroy the U.S.Government from within, by decaying social structure and
values! yeah! it fits! think about it: when did the bus come on the scene?
at the same time as the end of the war, a time of the Fluoridation of our
Precious Bodily Fluids, a time of the Cold War (a carefully planned scam
to prevent the Russians from recognizing what was happening and warn us).
what did the bus represent? a return to slow and steady, peace and love ...
totally contradicting the then-current main-stream of American society:
speed (ever faster cars, trains, airplanes trying to break the sound barrier)
and expansion (Interstate highways, to hurry the cars even faster).

hmmmm. you know ... i'll bet 60 Minutes could make an hour out of something
like that. :)

it is very late. i have been typing more of that bosch stuff in. i need REST!!
good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are. :)
