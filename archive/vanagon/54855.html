Subject: '86 Caravelle idling fixed, for now

Thanks for all input vs my idling problem.

It seems that the problem was -as usual- not so very exotic as my brain
tried to make it. I took apart and sprayed all connectors relating to the
engine, even on a black box in a socket &quot;behind&quot; the right rear light, that
I had to remove.

Then surprise! a nice and stable idle at all engine temperatures.
