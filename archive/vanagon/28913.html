Subject: WTB - Propane Setup for '78 Westy
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 13:17:46 -0500 (EST)
From: Jay.Goldberg_at_ska_dot_com (Jay Goldberg)

Hi all

I'm looking to pick up a propane setup for a '77 Westy.  The PPO had
removed it, and I don't know how to reach him.  Any ideas on where I
can pick one up (new/used/whatever)?  I need the tank, mounting stuff,
and hoses that lead to the stove.

If you have one you're not using, make me an offer!

I'm also interested in a propane RV heater, so same pleas applies.
