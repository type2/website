Subject: Inuvik (Arctic) Trip Monthly posting.

Hey, gang!   I've been getting mail about the trip, and given the 
ever-increasing size of the vanagon list, I thought I'd start posting 
standard info on a monthly basis to let new-comers know about it , and to 
everyone else up to date.

The trip: Vancouver, BC to Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada (and back).
Dates: Leave vancouver July 22, 1996
       Return Vancouver Aug 14, 1996 (or earlier if anticipated disasters 
                                       are avoided.)
Who: Anyone driving a VW bus.

Vancouver return trip distance is estimated to be 8424 km (5235 mi), of 
which 2703 km (1676 mi) is unpaved.  This is some of the most remote 
country in North America, and should be a trip to remember!  Everyone is 
invited.  If you've got kids, bring 'em along!  

I'll be sure to bring Something Along For Bob.

 Mailing list: inuvik_at_chaco_dot_com (sorry I don't have subscription info, 
but the Inuvik folder on my server has been wiped out!  Ron, could you 
post subscription info?)

Note: Some people have indicated they would love to make a trip up this 
way with a bunch of VW people, but are unable to make these dates.  Other 
folks have expressed interest in taking the Alaska marine Highway at 
least in one direction.  If there is enough interest, we may be able to 
arrange parallel, or following, trips.  I think discussion of these 
options should be conducted off the vanagon list (on the inuvik list) to 
save bandwidth on long-suffering Gerry's vanagon list.

Northward ho!
