My favorite is having the kid ask &quot;What do you need that for?&quot; when he
discovers the part I want is not in stock.  

Or, you're standing there with the old part, which has two bolt holes, and
the part they want to sell you has three and obviously won't fit.  But it is
the part listed in the computer for that make/model/year therefore it must be
right because....  (all together now..)  komputers can't make mistrakes.

Or being told, when asking for DOT-5 sillycone brake juice &quot;Nobody uses that
stuff.&quot;

One of the most hilarious exchanges occured in the state of Washington when I
was trying to track down some metric brake lines when I was working on
Grendel.  All of the FLAPS insisted they didn't carry 'metric stuff'.  When I
pointed out that imported Fords &amp; Chevys have metric fittings the guy said
&quot;Oh, you mean AMERICAN metric fittings.&quot;

The complexity of cars has followed a steady upward progression while the
person behind the parts counter remains someone willing to work for a minimum
wage.
