&gt;&gt; Jim, you might see if KEP would give you
&gt;&gt; &gt;the names of some V-6 conversion customers.  If the customers are like me, 
&gt;&gt; &gt;they'll be willing to talk endlessly about their swaps.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; if you do get some customers jim, please pass along their information, i am
&gt;&gt; deeply curious about this..

&gt;Me too!   I have so plans to make a microbus limosine for use in my 
&gt;business, one of the hang-ups is the powerplant.

I have a friend in Salt Lake City who, before his wife left with their '85
Vanagon Westfalia, had a Ford V6 engine installed in place of the
ridiculously under-powered diesel engine.  When the V6 was in perfect tune,
it ran well and had pretty much machismo.  But it got lousy gas mileage,
even on the highway.

I've heard of Ford Pinto, Subaru and Toyota engine swaps in buses and
Vanagons but don't really know how much better off you'd be with any of
those options. You might do better by having a good engine builder increase
the horsepower and cooling of your stock VW engine, through balancing (free
horsepower), modestly hot cam, stroke, slightly bigger jugs, hydraulic
lifters and electronic ignition (or at least one of those points replacement
modules from Pertronix or Compu-Fire).

A reliable Type IV engine can be built which has 150 or more horsepower.
Someone who advertises in Hot VWs sells plans or conversion kits allowing a
Type IV engine to fit a pre-1972 bus.
