Subject: coolant sensor price ramblings

Thanksgiving holiday will find me under, on, and in the '87 doing some
maintenance chores. Weather report is for temps in the single digits
and wind. Naturally, this is also the time i've scheduled for a
coolant sensor and antifreeze replacement.  No heated garage but at
least i know it won't rain and my dog doesn't bite.

I picked up sensor # 025-906-041A with the blue plastic top.  dealer 
had to order it.  i told him to order a bunch because we all know 
that sensor replacement will cure all that ails a wasserboxer.  he 
laughed and ordered one. i'll show him, right?  anyway, 
the unit cost me all of $10 plus some odd cents.  picked up a bunch 
of o-rings at the hardware store for a buck-and-a-half... dealer 
didn't have any on hand.

i'm expecting great things from this sensor replacement.  also will
replace NGK plugs with Bosch triple-electrode, change air filter, put 
in the 5-30 synthetic in prep for the -40 temps arriving in 6 weeks,
and i see that the throttle switch isn't clicking at all off idle. 
currently, my idle is hunting during warm-up.  actually, i like this
cause now it 'fast idles' when i first start it-- seems like an old
friend, that fast idle.  remember trying to get the choke spring,
choke pull-off, and fast idle cam all synchronized on the old iron? 
oops, guess some of you folk still have that stuff.

if i was truly a geek (and not married) i would change each
component one at a time and analytically report the change in
minutia.  as it is i'll be slamming the parts in and try to get 
cleaned up before my scheduled time runs out.  

in contrast, winter preparation for my '86 Camry (259K miles!)
consists of throwing an ice-scraper in the glove box...  :(
