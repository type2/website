Subject: Questions About Buying Diesel Westi

I'm in the market for a used Westi and I am trying to decide if a diesel is worth 
considering.

If anyone has any opinions or comments about owning a diesel Vanagon, I would appreciate it.

Also, I have never owned a diesel powered vehicle.  I am wondering:
    - Are these diesels mechanically reliable?
    - How long will they typically last (miles)?
    - Are they rebuildable?
    - Any potential design problems?
    - What should I look for when considering a used diesel Vanagon?

I am aware of the lack of power, and the higher gas mileage is motivating me.

Thanks in advance.
