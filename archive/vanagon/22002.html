All,

I could not resist telling this story

------------   TEXT ATTACHMENT   --------
SENT 08-02-95 FROM GOLDBERG_DAVID _at_AUSTIN

Last night when I got off work (midnight) I was on my way home, listening
for any odd noises before I got on the main road. While accelerating to shift
into second gear, my foot goes all the way to the floor.  Now I've just had
a rough day, there was this nasty thunder storm, that knocked the power out,
and I was busy trying to get all of the recover procedures for the systems,
and restart procedures for all of the backups that crashed, out of my head,
so it did not dawn on me immediately that the accelerator cable had snapped.

Well when it did, I was p**sed to say the least.  I then ran my options:

1. call my wife, have her pick me up - went out of town today
2. call a cab, get tow bar, and car with trailer hitch - that's the car my wife
   took out of town!
3. call a cab, use the third car to run to the FLAPS and get a new accelerator
   cable - Wife has only key to third car, refer to #1
4. go to Albertsons(24 hour grocery store) and purchase some stuff and jerry-
   rig something to get home - the only viable option, short of staying at
   work overnight, and getting a ride home in the morning, NOT

Well, I don't have a proper tool kit in the car, so I need some pliers, a
flashlight, and some heavy duty strapping tape(who knows maybe it will work)
As I am walking back from Albertsons(1/4 mi) I remember seeing some cable
in the trunk of the car that I thought was emergency brake cable. Well, I
picked up the pace. When I get to the car I am so excited, that just maybe
someone(something?) was looking out for me, and saw fit to put an accelerator
cable in the trunk of my car. I open the trunk, and I can't find the cable,
I fumble around with the miscelaneous tools(none of which are a pair of
pliers) and when I am at about wits end, I put my hand on the very thing
I was looking for. I hold the flashlight up to it, and with nervous
anticipation I pull the pedal out of the way and, and, and....

it's an accelerator cable!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Without hesitation I pull the old one out, and feed it through the tunnel,
It gets hung up in the engine compartment, I go back there and contort my
arm, and fit it between the fan shroud, and the firewall, and manage to
feed the end through the tunnel in the shroud, and attach it to the linkage,
and the rest, as they say, is history.  I would like to personally thank,
whoever posted the instructions on putting in a new accelerator cable, on
what ever list it was posted to. I did not have the post, but I have this
uncanny way of storing seemingly useless information, in the theory that I
will need it sometime in the future.


Cheers,

David
