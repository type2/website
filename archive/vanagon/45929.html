Subject: VW Mechanic near Allentown?

We've got a 1970 VW Bus and we desperately need a recommendation for 
someone to fix a bad oil leak. We're stuck in Allentown at Helmet 
Hoyer's. He says he's too busy to get to us. Meanwhile, our 4th of 
July weekend is ruined. Any suggestions would be gratefully 
appreciated.
