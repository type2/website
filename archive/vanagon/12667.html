    For those interested East Coasters, how about Umstead Park for the
weekend of March 31/April 1st? My college radio station, WKNC, and more
particularly my show, the Hippie Hour, are once again staging our Spring
gathering there. So, I figured I'd appeal to both the Volkswagen and the
Grateful Dead types, since there's a large crossover anyway. Hopefully,
more people can make it. 
  William B. Umstead State Park is located in Raleigh, NC, off highway
70. We will be in the family camping section, which is $9.00 per spot. 
NO POWER HOOK-UPS
Also, do not take the Interstate 40 exit for the park, as the two halves
are not connected.
  Gates close at 8 pm, so perhaps more folks can make it. Any interest?
Richard
