Subject: vanagon brown

Spent time on the weekend prettying up the 81 interior: changed the color
of the vinyl trim on the '85 middle and rear seats from tan to brown, and
put in headrests.  The vinyl coloring stuff that JCWhitney sells as 
Cordovan Brown is close enough to two or three of the 17 different browns
in an early Vanagon interior.  The stuff seems to work pretty well; does
a great job of keeping the vinyl grain.  We'll see how it handles wear and
winter cold.  

As mentioned in someone's recent post, you need a black plastic sleeve for
each leg of a headrest.  OR if you don't need up/down adjustability, you
just need something tubular with .75in. OD and .5in. ID.  I used clear
plastic hose, 9inches per leg.
