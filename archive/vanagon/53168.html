Subject: Re: avon or nokia sno tires

I just put a set of Hakkaapelitta 10's on my 87 synchro, I looked at the
BF Goodrich tires and the Nokia's look to be the ultimate snow tire for
VW Vans. We had our first snow in town in October. I found the steepest
hill I could find and stopped reversed, popped the clutch etc...and the
van didn't lose any traction. BTW I didn't have them studded. They were
expensive, but I'm a very happy customer.
