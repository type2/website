Subject: wheel bearing part #s

Ho folks, 

Anyone done the wheel bearings F/R and made a note of the manufacturer and
part number?  ie.  SKF or FAG most likely.  Mine need doing. I have a
preference for buying bearings from a bearings supply house (plus they give
me a decent discount) rather than paying 3-4 times the cost to have VAG
repackage them and send them to the dealer.  A nice idea would be a bearing
FAQ, listing all the bearings in vanagons and mfg/# data.  Lots of place
don't sell VW bearings, but can cross-list if given a real bearing number.
