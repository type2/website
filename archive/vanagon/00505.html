Subject:      who and where (again?) ...

well, i finally got my main frame connection back yesterday and could get
caught up on my email at work ... where i have more time. :)  a couple of
people have added themselves to our motley crew, and i lost a couple from
my file (their email bounced on me ... well, it has been a year or so).
