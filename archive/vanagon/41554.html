2) I have this mystery plug in that is inbetween the cigarette lighter =
and
the right side vent. Its obviously some sort of add on but I cant even =
tell
what kind of plug it is. It's quite weird. It seems that the plug has =
both
male and female characteristics. Its a 1/4 plug slot with a small nipple
sticking out, yet it also has part of a RCA housing inside. Any clues?


This plug maost likely is a german power plug, originally (i think) for =
some sort of space saving tire/compressor setup.  It is also used on BMW =
motorcycles for accessories like heated vests, etc.  The plugs should be =
availiable at the BMW dealer.=20

hope this helps
