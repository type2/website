&gt; As I was fueling I noticed a White maybe '89 Westy with a full RV AC 
&gt; unit mounted up top.  He was accelerating out of the parking lot.  I 
&gt; noticed a loud throaty exhaust note and that the van was squatting 
&gt; under the accelaration forces like a pooch begging for a bone.  Just 
&gt; wondering if anyone knows this van and what the heck is under the rear 
&gt; deck????
&gt; 

I think I know..it may be the syncro westy owned by a Mr Damgard of 
Victoria. It has a 6 cyl Porsche engine (don't know what displacement). 
Also has brush bars up front and the Australian type windshield protector 
(angled wire mesh deal below window). It also has 15&quot; wheels and that 
awfully ugly square unit up on the luggage rack.
