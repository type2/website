Subject: Re: Fancy Wheel$$$

&gt;I have the same wheels on my Notchback. It cost me $100.00 each to have them
&gt;fully polished.

&gt;&gt;Thus spake Tom (formerly wealthy) Carrington.

&gt;&gt;Lemme see ~$200-$400 for the wheels themselves and $400 for the polishing.

&gt;&gt;That's a fair chunk of change for a shoes for a decrepit 30yr-old notchback.

&gt;&gt;Oh, you wanted TIRES too?

&gt;&gt;Who said used cars are cheap?

   No, not wealthy. Not then or now.  Your prices are about right, though.
   $325 for the set of 5, and $500 for the polish job (had to get the spare done
   too, right?). Add about $150 for the center caps and lugs/studs and you are
   done. Might I add this was in 1985, WAY before wife and kids came along.

   Decrepit?!  OUCH!

   (Preparing to be flamed) And to make it worse, I was just out of school, and
   living at home when I bought the Notch. (Only $750!). But my Dad would only
   let me have one car at his house, sooo, I had to sell my no-rust Texas-raised
   '80 Vanagon.

   I'm sorry! I realize the err in my ways! I repent!
