&gt; &gt;well, i certainly hope Ralphie Boy Nader doesn't find out about how poorly
&gt; &gt;a vanagon (and a winnebago) came out in the California 60-ton Crash Test!
&gt; 
&gt; You know, I was just thinking, what would happen if a covoy of 30 Type 2s
&gt; in a convoy _at_ 30mph happened to nail this particular tank head on, while
&gt; it was traveling merrily along _at_ 30mph?
&gt; 
&gt; Would we have 30 sequential spontaneous bus/van/transporter explosions,
&gt; or one hell of a pileup on the interstate (and a bunch of German troops
&gt; running around with bad headaches)?
&gt; 
&gt; Inquiring (idle) minds want to know!....

I think what you'd have is:

Vana-going, Vana-going......Vana-gone !
