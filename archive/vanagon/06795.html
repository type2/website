Subject: discussion list, TGIF, flat

wow, digest 235 is a winner...

first off, we have &quot;hgoldman_at_umassd_dot_edu&quot; inquiring about EVs... hmmm, where
have we seen that &quot;umassd_dot_edu&quot; address before...?
 
 RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu = hgoldman_at_umassd_dot_edu??!  :-0

Hey, Joel, I think it might be time to add another EV to the tally... ;)
(Harvey, do you have an EV?  inquiring minds want to know.)

So then, Unka Joel goes on to incite:

&gt;This Group Is Flatulent

well, Joel, if that's the case, then it must be because The Gas Is Free
(just make sure poor Will opens all the windows and doesn't light a match!)

My own personal choice for TGIF =  This Group (Gruppe?) Is FRESH!


Have a great weekend you crazies!
Norman
