Subject: Alternate A/C refrigerants?

I've got a '91 Carat that needs A/C work, and I'm thinking that it's
time to bite the bullet and switch the refrigerant from R12 to...
something.  Has anyone tried R134a yet?  Are Eric Zeno's old notes on
this from the archives accurate?  Anyone try Pennzoil's FR12/Frigc?
Other suggestions or comments?

Summer's coming up fast down here in the steamy South...
