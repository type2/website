&gt; Whats interesting, is I saw 25hp dist caps last weekend for sale, for $10

&gt; the deal was, and he said it was for some sort of industrial motor.  Anyone
&gt; ever heard of these?

It might be that 2 of the cylinders were used as a 2 stage pump, and the 
other 2 were the power source, so you would only need 2 power cylinders.
