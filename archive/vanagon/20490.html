Subject: RE:Eurovan drivetrains

&gt;VW put the 5 cyl. in the US versions primarily because of
&gt;the torque characteristics of the engine would suit
&gt;having A/C, P/S, and auto-trannies, etc.. better than
&gt;the 4 cylinder engine.

We always get a wide range of engine options in Europe to meet the 
requirements of each country. Different countries have different tax systems 
and 2 litres is often the maximum above which higher taxes apply. We always 
got the 1600 option in buses and vanagons, and turbo deisels, etc. Germany 
gets even more engine and body style options than the UK.
