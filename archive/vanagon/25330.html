Subject: Re:More Bus Valance Thoughts...

&gt;I thought the valance might be the part of the roof (in the early type II)
&gt;that houses the fresh air intake and hangs over the front windshield(screen).

Rusty replied:
I would agree with that thought also. I thought of that as an alternative. I
don't think VW would make a big deal out of a 2&quot; strip of formica on masonite!
Let's go ahead and throw it out on the list!

Possibilities:

1. Fresh Air overhang on post (mid)'55-67 buses.
2. Decorative strip of masonite in Westies located above windows and below
headliner.
3. The narrow strip of heavy cardboard wrapped in headliner material in
similar position to the description for #2.
4. Two different(respected) parts and repair places mentioned the engine
&quot;apron&quot; as their first suggestion for the valance. They both described the
item as the piece located directly behind the engine decklid that is removed
by loosening four bolts and two pan screws.
