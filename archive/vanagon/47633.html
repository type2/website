Subject: plastic water

I have problem with my water developing a &quot;plastic&quot; falavour after just 
24 hours in the tank.  Here's the guff:

I noted the impeller was off the shaft of the submersible pump.  I had to 
remove some kind of tape from the unit and discoveved that the bottom of 
the pump was simply taped in place and the impeller was easily repaired.

I rinced the tank with baking powder and a good rinse but could only find 
gaffer or duct tape to retape the pump back together.  i think that tap 
is the sourse of my water spoilage.  What to do?  I've asked for 
submersable tape from pool vendors and they look at me as if i had two 
heads.

Suggestions?  I was thinking of gluing the bottom of the pump onto the 
base.

Suggestions would be appreciated.
