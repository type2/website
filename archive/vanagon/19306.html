Subject: 71' for $3500 ?


Hi all.  I just spotted a 71' weekender in town (Duluth Mn.)  It has a 
rebult motor (ten miles ago), new carb, new exhaust, new paint job, no 
rust/bondo (Montana Plates), redone interior, very, very solid.  The asking price is 
$3500 this seems like too much, what do you think?

I bought my 73 westy (77'rebuilt 2.0) for $3400 from the same guy and it had 
about 25 miles on the rebuilt, and a new paint job and custom interior.  
I am considering trading if its a good deal.  We are planning a long trip soon 
(to Indiana then on to Taos, New Mexico and back to Minnesota, about 2000 
Mi) and I think I would feel more comfortable with a stand up motor than the 
pancake, fuel injected 2.0.  Since I don't know that much about the newer 
motors I could be making a mistake, what do ya think?
