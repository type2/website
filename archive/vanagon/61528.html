Subject: Tire Deals in DC Area

I just bought 4 Uniroyal 195x75 14s 6-ply tires for my '87 Synchro from
Price Club, which pervades the DC area.  Total cost for 4 was something
like $225.  Pricey Club's price includes road hazard, free repairs and
free rotating &amp; balancing for the life of the tires.  

Yeah, the 195 isn't a 205, but the height is .11&quot; taller.  So what?  (I
suppose I don't agree w/having to micrometer door gap seals; said
another way, why put jeweled bearings on a wheelbarrow?)

The tires are truck tires, but don't have a particularly aggressive
tread pattern.  Quiet enough on the road &amp; handle at least as well as
the box they're attached to.  Not that I don't like driving the Synchro,
quite the contrary.
