Subject: 914 motor etc

Would someone who is also on the aircooled list please pass this on, thanks.

I have a running, drivable '71 914 for sale, for someone looking for engine,
running gear for their Vanagon. The body has some rust. I want $500 for it.
If interested, please get back to me at derekwh125_at_aol_dot_com

Thanks
