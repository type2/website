[Virus Hoax Deleted]
OK, I'm sick of seeing this thing.  First of all, this &quot;virus&quot; is a
hoax, exactly like penpal greetings and good times.  If you read the
thing, you notice they only changed the file name.

Now, this being a VW list, virus warnings don't belong here anyway.  Do
NOT post virus warnings unless you've contacted the list admin (Gerry
Skerbitz) and checked the authenticity of the warning with him.
