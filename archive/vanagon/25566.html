Subject: DP in &quot;How to hot rod VW engines&quot;
Date: Tue, 26 Sep 1995 23:31:11 -0500 (CDT)

I accidentally deleted somebody's message but believe the question was
whether Bill Fisher's &quot;hot rod&quot; book (1970) has anything on dual ports. It
does. He writes (p. 49):

&quot;1968-70 fastback, squareback, notchback &quot;Variant&quot; engines have dual-port
heads and 1600 cc displacement. All 1971 VW's have these heads.
[...] ultimate configuration for high performance. [...] These heads, P/N
311 101 355D, cost about $45 each at the VW store. Intake-port area on
these heads can be vastly enlarged by the &quot;square-port&quot; technique
developed by Gene Berg. These are &quot;the&quot; heads to use for all-out
high-performance VW engines, [...]&quot;
