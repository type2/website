VV&gt;Has anyone tried modifying a coolant resevoir cap to allow 
VV&gt;pressurization of the cooling system? Maybe a bicycle floor pump and 
VV&gt;presta/schrader valve assembly on a spare cap would work to 
VV&gt;determine if there are any leaks? A low cost leak-down test?
VV&gt;Just a thought.

   I had heard at on time that there was in existance a pressure tester
cap for vanagon systems much like the ones for american cars. Pehaps an
adapter could be made to adapt an american pressure tester to Vws
