Subject: Re: Heater pipe insulation

My pipe onthe 60 delux had asbetos also. Get a respirator at the home depot
and get the asbestos filters (35 bucks) and get that stuff outathere!! It 
will continue to drop fibers and everytime you are under the bus for the 
occasional work party (oil, brakes, trany) you will be inhaling that stuff.
After you get the stuff gone, wash at the car wash real good with the pressure
washer. Good luck
