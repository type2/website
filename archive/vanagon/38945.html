&gt;Can someone tell me what the inside diameter is on the fuel pump to 
&gt;filter hose? I have some 1/4&quot;, but didn't want to take it off unless 
&gt;I had the right size. Also, is the size the same for all the fuel 
&gt;lines to injectors &amp; stuff? If so, can I just buy a few feet of it 
&gt;(and a ton of new clamps) &amp; have at 'er? 
&gt;
&gt;

The hose is actually 8mm or 5/16 inch.  Do not use standard fule hose unless
you are trying to collect fire insurance.  The fuel system operates at 40psi
and standard line is usually godd for 15psi.  make sure hose you buy is rated
for fuel injection service.  I actually go to the dealer and make sure they
give me the late model &quot;good&quot; stuff.  Avoid the early style fuel hose used on
the air cooled vans.  In fact, I upgrade those to the later style hose and I
route the new hose in the plastic sleeves where ever it can touch anything
warm or sharp.
