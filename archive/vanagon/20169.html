Have we any listmembers in that part of the world?

Do any have an easygoing shipping receiving dept. at work that will
send out just about anybox for free without asking questions?

Do you have a catbox that you could dump into a box and send to that 
address?


Anything worse that I wont mention in an open forum?

Sorry, Pimps of any sort piss me off.
