&gt;hooked up to the exhaust pipe.  The filter was so rusted that I just took it
&gt;off when I put this engine in the car.

Right after I installed the '78 motor in the '73 chassis I found that the
EGR filter was rusted through in 4 places.  I replaced it with a new filter
(in fear of not passing smog inspection) and found that the previous owner
had welded shut both ends of the old filter.  It looked like a functioning 
filter from the outside. Emissions test passed with flying colors.


The jerking at a certain throttle position may be a worn air flow box.
It was on my '78 TypeIV motor.  At a comfortable mid-throttle position
the VW would surge and hesitate.  $200 bucks and a new Bosch air flow box
it runs great at any throttle position.
