final memory, but of a squareback; was salvaging
a reel to reel instrumentation recorder that on
the case said 820 pounds.  it was exactly as big
as the space in the squareback.  a few sawed off
broom handles were roller bearings to get it in
the vehicle.  steering was hell as the front wheels
had no useful contact with the pavement.  had to
take a pretty long route to avoid a RR crossing
that i just new would be trouble.  (i can see it
now, car with recorder collapsed on track waiting
for the express.)
