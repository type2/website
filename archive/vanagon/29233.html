&gt; &gt;Grrr!  Don't get me started on portion control!  Damn Jenny Craig fascists!
&gt; 
&gt; what does Jenny Craig have to do with german cars?? does she drive a
&gt; Portion 911?? i think not... more likely a pink Cataract or maybe a
&gt; Wrinkled Continent.   :)

Well, some of those women have their own zip (postal) codes.

Maybe its like the license plates &quot;Illinois Apportioned&quot;  Ouch!  Thats
a big serving!

After that, do you get a Lamburpini?  I guess we could have a real Fiesta
with this thread, now that Joel, Clara and I have set the Tempo.  If we
Probe much further it will be clear as Neon that this thread is destined
to No Va.  Who busses the tables?  Are we putting the dessert cart before
the horseless carriage?

Anyway, wish me luck - tomorrow I start my new job - SysAdmin for a company
that sells auto shop manuals and tech bulletins on CD-ROM!  Hopefully the
extra cash will better afford me to sustain my German metal habit.  I
really wanted to make a joke out of that, but I don't know any German
metal groups.  Darn - my turb at the podium and I draw a blank...
