Subject:  

I have an '82 Westphalia that was a diesel converted to gas engine.  The oil
pump is still the diesel so the pickup tube can reach the oil pan.  The check
valve on the pump releases at around 115 psi which seems to be a helluva lot of
pressure.  My mechanic mentioned that he has seen this on a number of diesels. 
He tested a gas engine oil pump that releases at around 80 psi.  Do the diesels
require a special oil filter to withstand this pressure?  Why did they make
them with such a strong release spring?  Was it a mistake?  I'm specifically
concerned because I live in Wyoming where the weather is cold and the oil is
thick.  Any help would be appreciated.
