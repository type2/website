John asks:
&gt; BTW somebody
&gt; once mentioned a spray moly EP grease for something like
&gt; motorcycle chain lubrication but I haven't been able to find
&gt; the stuff, anybody got any ideas?

Gunk makes a chain lube commonly sold at hardware-ish type type ie
Walmart Kmart Target Ace etc that has &quot;Moly&quot; in it... this is
somewhat of a new formulation because you'll see some cans of Gunk
chain lube with it and some without, as their stock is used up.  I
use it for the linkage periodically and while it doesn't last a long
time, it is easy to apply and eases shifting.
