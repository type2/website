Subject: RE: technical bulletins

Check the Popular Mechanics web page. They offer a set of CD-ROMs with both 
the factory service bulletins and general mechanics info. For a given fee you 
get the unlock code for one model and year, and I'm told they have all the VW 
stuff included. (Other years / models still there for another fee.) 

I remember seeing the same CD-ROM idea available somewhere else - Oh yeah - 
http://www.alldata_dot_com/consumer/TSB/yr.html - the Alldata service bulletin 
CD-ROMS. Check out that website - you enter your year, type (Volkswagon Truck) 
and model and get a listing of all the recalls and service bulletins on the 
CD-ROM - lets you see if it's worthwhile to order. It lists 152 TSBs for the 
'87 Vanagon.

Hey Volksters,

Does anyone know how to get technical bulletins from VW. I noticed that
there are quite a few for my vehicle and I was wondering how I might get
my hands on them to see what VW does about the problems. Thanks.

Dave
