Subject: 75 Westy LP, Wiring Diagram &amp; Owners Manual Queries

From: jds_at_media.mit_dot_edu


   I have a '75 with a burned out auxilliary power system
and no wiring diagram.  Would anyone in the South Bay area
have a diagram and perhaps a owners manual I could copy?

   I believe my regulator is shot as well.  When I open 
the valve on the LP tank gas vents through the center
hole in the regulator.  Holding a match up to it :-)
shows a bit of rust inside.  I recall in reading the archives
that this regulator is no longer made and that another is
availble but not quite right.  Would I buy a new one or 
hit a junk yard and hope for the best?

  Please respond directly to me, or at least CC me.
