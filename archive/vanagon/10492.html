Comment on safety--somewhat gruesome if you don't want to read on.

A friend of mine went airborne over a canal and went head on into the cement
on the other side. Yes in a van. Speed 65mph (he fell asleep).

They had to cut the van off him (very sad).

Two hip pins and six months R&amp;R and he was as good as new. Unfortunately
the bus never rode again.

HOW many cars will allow you to survive a 65mph head-on into cement?

It doesn't seem to make sense but IMHO a bus is engineered.
