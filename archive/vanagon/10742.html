&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can anyone elaborate for me on the relationship between Jack Kerouac
&gt;&gt; and VW busses?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; /martha
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Well, Jack did have a thing for Mexican women.  In fact, so did 
&gt;William S. Boroughs, it almost got him a life sentence once, or 
&gt;something like that.

Burroughs escaped to Northern Africa after killing his &quot;wife&quot; in a drug
induced fracas.  As far as W.S. Burroughs having a thing for Mexican
women...  He might have come closer to having a thing for Mexican men. :-).
BTW he's still alive and living in Lawrence, Kansas, where he is a tenured
professor of English at the University of Kansas.
