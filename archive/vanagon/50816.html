Subject: RE: Wacko Wiring &amp; Snow ?

I have an '83.5 (previously had an '84) and I live in the mountains in Eastern 
PA.  The Vanagon is not too bad in the snow it has very good rear traction but 
your steering is almost not there if it's real slippery.  I use snow tires, 
which help a great deal (they go on this weekend BTW) and chains when it's 
really bad. The van is unstoppable with chains, I pass stuck 4x4's all the 
time.  (I just hate hitting cleared road though, thump whack thump whack.... 
:))  Be careful, sliding sideways in a Vanagon down a hill on ice is quite an 
experience, one not found in a passenger car.

&gt;&gt;Also, Someone posted a comment that Vanagons didn't handle well in
&gt;&gt;snow.  Is that compared to the Bus or a front wheel drive or what?  How
&gt;&gt;does it mishandle (fishtail, not turn, not move, wig out at 35 mph)?
