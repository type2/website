&gt;The '56 has once again developed an electrical gremlin.

&gt;A few weeks ago, it started doing this thing where it would not
&gt;start if it the motor was hot.  It would just turn over weakly.
&gt;If you let it sit, for a while, it was fine, or if you pushed it,
&gt;it would start right up.

Will it start right up, when hot, if you short across the terminals on the
starter?  The Bozobus used to do this.  The relay trick worked at first
(Bug rear-window defogger relay) but it started having problems again.
&gt;
&gt;Now when I turn the key, it just clicks.  If I keep working it, it eventually
&gt;turns over rapidly and fires right up.  I can hear the &quot;ping&quot; of the starter
&gt;gear, but it doesn't turn over at all.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?  I was thinking the ignition switch might be bad...

That's what it was on Mr. Bozo.  Replacement was the cure.
Test it by hot wiring it, leaving the ignition switch out of the circuit.
If it still won't start, we're both wrong.

Are you still using the original (or a used replacement) ignition switch?
