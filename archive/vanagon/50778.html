Subject: Re: neat web stuff (hi-top eurovan)


I just checked

http://tawny.bu_dot_edu/JandJ/GIFs/GERMANY/CD291970.jpg

and Joel is right, it's an Eurovan. I never heard about
'Fanatic' camper models. But, if Janet got her papers
in Bad Homburg, the only Camper manufacturer near by, as
I know, is Baumgartner. Address at

/1/caravan96/d/21/B/99/45

But Baumgartner continues Camper conversions only on
Mercedes vans. The high roof looks like one of the after
market models built by 'Hauschild'. Address of this
factory (Kunststoffverarbeitung) you will find at

BTW: No one interested in receiving the Westy picture? The
whole right side is cutted for a view inside. I'm looking
for a host.
