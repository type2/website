So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just wanted to add that the new title says SALVAGE prominently, so there 
&gt; &gt;is no mistaking what you're getting. Some states don't do this.
&gt; 
&gt; Good point Bob, but I've heard of DMV screwing up and NOT putting it on 
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; there.  There are also problems with some insurance companies not 
&gt; covering salvage vehicles for certain types of policies.  I'm a bit
&gt; fuzzy here 'cause I haven't actually done it...

Boy, that's an understatement.  Gosh, I sure love paying my CA taxes
when I hear about the DMV paying 40 big ones (that's 40 million folks)
for a computer system they can't use.  I'm REALLY gettin' to hate
this state. :[
