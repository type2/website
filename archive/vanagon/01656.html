Subject: What to do about hubcaps

On my '84 Vanagon I have three original hubcaps and one Iacocca special...
Should I try to replace the Chrysler hubcap with an original?  I don't
even like these original hubcaps with their fake lug nuts.  Anything fake
always looks bad to me.  Can I just get rid of the hubcaps altogether?
(If I do get rid of them, is there someone who wants to buy them cheap?)
