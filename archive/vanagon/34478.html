'67 VW bus with Safaris. Running, driving, needs some work. $500.obo
(000)000-0000.
 
BOOM! sold by 8AM. Never saw it, only heard about from a friend who called
and missed by hours. It *may* have been worth it, for someone, just to snag
the Safaris &lt;if German&gt; at the least, and blow it out for $500. obo Whew!
The friend was going off about how it coulda been a 21 window. Yeah, and it
coulda been garaged with no miles on it since Grampa died 29 years ago too.
More likely it was Davey Jones locker used as a crash test vehicle and
slammed to the ground with half complete stolen BB safaris &lt;without title&gt;.

I'm sure Ill soon see an ad for '67 vw bus needs work &lt;no mention of
safaris&gt; $1500-$2500 obo.
