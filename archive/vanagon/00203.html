&gt;I need to replace the exhaust system on my 86 Synchro. It needs
&gt;replacement from the headers out.
&gt;Does anyone have any recommendations for a replacement system? For
&gt;example, should I just buy one at the dealer or will a 914 2.0 exhaust
&gt;fit?

uhhhh... i don't think anything off a 914 will fit the water-boxer engines.
the cylinders are closer together on the bus.  now the air-cooled vanagons
of 1980-1983 might be able to get away with using 914 components.
