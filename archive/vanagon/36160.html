Subject: Sliding door lock 

The lock on the passenger side sliding door of our 86 Syncro doesn't
work with the key. I've tried shooting it with graphite, but that
didn't change the situation.

The three other doors, fuel cap and ignition all are ok, so I know
the key isn't shot. Other than the outside handle being a little 
&quot;jiggly&quot;, there is nothing obviously wrong with the latch mechanism.

Has anyone experienced this problem, and if so, how did you fix it?
