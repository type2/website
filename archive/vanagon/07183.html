I was there last year on business, as well as Brazilia, Brazil.  In Brazilia,
the airport uses brand new busses for everything.  When I de-planed (from
a US Gov't plane; I was working at the airport), the first sight I saw was
6 or so brand new busses sitting all over the place.  Since I was working 
there, I got to talking with one of the airport workers (as best as the 
language barrier would allow!), and he was telling me that there were two
versions of the bus they were using; one was gasoline powered, and one was
propane!  He let me crawl all around, under, and through one.  Sure were
pretty, and all had that new car smell!  I rode around quite a bit in them
as well, and can tell you that they suffer from the same lack of power that
most of us experience in ours!  I took lots and lots of pictures; I don't
have access to a scanner, otherwise I'd share them with everyone.

I didn't get any pictures of penguins, though :-(
