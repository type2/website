Subject: Happy Vanagon Class III Hitched

Hi Listers,

A couple weeks ago an ad was posted on the listserv for a Vanagon class 
III hitch.  I was even studying the Vanagon Archives a few hours before 
the msg appeared! (Feb. 23rd)   Being as I was in the market for one, I 
quickly bought it.  I guess it was lucky day.  8-)

Well, today an albatross-wrapped-in-cardboard looking thing was sitting 
in my drive, thanks to UPS, and it really is an incredible pice of 
engineering and welding work.  It triangulates down from the bumper area 
a ways and mounts in 6 existing holes on the sub-frame, going much inward 
than stock mounts.  The bumper bolts to the hitch assembly about 7 cm 
longer than stock.  The receiver doesn't stick out beyond the bumper.

I imagine it is similiar to the class III hitches used on Vanagons by the 
Canadian and Isreali armies.  It's really heavy duty.  I have an adjustable 
slide in ball mount from my old Ford F-150 that should work well for 
whatever ball mounting heighth I need.  Perhaps this weekend I'll paint it 
and get it installed.  Wait, perhaps I better re-install the tranny first, 
after I get it back together!   

At any rate, I'm quite pleased with the hitch assembly and even happier 
about being part of the Vanagon Listserv!  This is great stuff!!!  8-)
