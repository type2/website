Subject: cooling system flushing
Date: Sun, 17 Aug 1997 16:21:40 -0500

------------
	While flushing the cooling system on my 86 vanagon I ran into a problem
and ask the wisdom of the list for a probable cause.I drained and filled a
total of 5 times warming up after each. Following the procedure in Bentley
page 19.16 it was on the third refill.I had the expansion tank full and my
wife started the engine and keeping it at 2k rpm no coolant flowed out the
radiator bleeder screw.After about 1 minute we shut the engine off,the
expansion tank was still full and both bleeder screws were open.What was
the probable cause of this malfunction?I ended up using a little   air into
 the 7mm hose at the rear expansion tank,this forced the coolant right up
and out the bleeder screw.After this we restarted the engine and all worked
per Bently book.
	We had trouble only on the 3rd refill the other 4  went smooth.I had the
front of the westy on ramps and parked up a hill so my front was elevated
throughout the entire procedure.tia
