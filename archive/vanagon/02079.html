Subject: More trip talk

Hi again,
	Just thought I would let you all know that, after reviewing every
message that has been posted about the trip, there were only 14 people
including Martha and I, that have expressed an interest in participating,
with another 6 having made comments, without saying that they would
participate.  Of the 14, 4 have indicated a preference for April or May,
1 prefers July, and 2 just said &quot;summer&quot;.  All of this assuming 1995, of
course.
	If we are to make this trip a reality (and I think it could *really*
turn into something *great*!) we will need to have more people than this
participating!  I hope that there are more of you that just haven't gotten
around to mailing in yet...  We will need at least 6 to push &quot;Da Boat&quot; 
(Das Boot, auf Deutsch, heh heh) when it breaks down!

I am going to create a mail alias for all of the people who are interested
in participating in this trip, to be used to distribute information.  If
you have expressed an interest in this trip and *don't* want to be on this
list, please let me know and I will remove you from it.

Finally,  Martha and I have agreed to pool our information indefinately, so
if you send private e-mail to either of us, the other will see it too.
This would normally be a breach of e-mail ettiquite, but I think in this case
it probably doesn't matter.  :)  Anyway, if you want something sent to either
of us personally to remain private, please state it in the message and we
will of course comply.

I already have visions of that great camper caravan rolling down the highway,
campfires, food, nat'l parks, and starry skies... *sigh*

That reminds me of a song!  Wait, I think I remember.... ummmm...
&lt;someone take it from here, please!&gt;

-David
