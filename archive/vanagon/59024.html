Hey all,
I've noticed that when driving with the fridge lit on propane, rolling
down the driver's window usually causes the flame to extinguish.  I
think it's setting up some kind of draft or suction.  Any ideas from
anyone?

&gt;      I have driven many thousands of miles contiguously with the 
&gt;      refrigerator in my westy running on propane while driving (three 
&gt;      trans-american trips in the last two years).  
&gt;      
&gt;      I've never had a problem with the flame being extinquished.
