I see the Puget Sound area is second to N. California, if your not busy joel,
I wonder if you could give bus/sq. mi. of some form of density figures
&lt;chuckle&gt; I think that would be even more illuminating :)
And while your at it maybe a breakdown by year, type, etc.  Perhaps with a
graph or map, that would be really helpful ;).
