&gt;Does anyone have one named &quot;Hitler&quot;?  I think it would be great to have a

uhhhhhhhhh. i really don't think that would be a good idea. that's not
exactly a name that people like. i knew a guy in high school who had a
little dachshund he tried to call Hitler, but it went over like a lead
balloon, so he changed it to Weiner, which is about the same. :)

besides, it might make people remember you and your bus for the wrong
reasons. kinda like me naming my bus Custer or Jackson (i have a bit of
native american ancestory ... although the Irish side won out on
appearance). :)

of course, it doesn't matter to me, cause i'm just ignoring all this color
and name and pantyhose size junk you guys are throwing out! so there! :P
