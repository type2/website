Martha the BusGirl inquired:

&gt;For those of you with Eurovans in the US, what kind of fuel
&gt;economy do you get city/highway?  Is yours manual or auto tranny?
&gt;Also, what is the cruise range?  Are you happy with the power?

Well, Michael P.'s response was pretty accurate, except that I don't
get to do near as much interstate as him, so I see the opposite end
of the mileage spectrum :-(   That said, I typically get about 16-17
mpg on a typical tank, consisting of probably 80% city and the rest
highway.  As I recall on a couple of trips down to Santa Barbara a
couple years ago it was getting about 22mpg w/ the cruise set to 65-
70.  I forget which direction it is (south, I think) but there's a definite
headwind/tailwind factor to take into account, as half of the trip got
about 1-1.5 mpg better (or worse) mileage than the other half.

BTW, the EV is the same as Michael's (MV, non-weekender) w/ a
5 speed manual.  Matter of fact, you might have seen it when we
got together a couple years ago at Kelley Park, remember?

Now if we had that TDI motor you've got in your Passat wagon,
well, we wouldn't have to think about buying another vehicle for
quite some time, would we?....  ;-)

Oh, yeah, cruising range for us would be about 375 miles because of
the type of driving we do, but I suppose it could be as much as 500
miles if we didn't lead-foot it everywhere.

Hey, wanna trade?  I'm lusting after your Passat...  :-0

Cheers,
Norman
