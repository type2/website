Subject: Looking for support...[was Inuvik trip]


Hola!

	I just finished reading Tobin's most recent update on the
Inuvik expedition.  &quot;I can't believe I'm missing this one!&quot;, I mutter
to I-self as I look out the window at Ras Bulli Split -- up on four
jackstands with front suspension laying to one side of the
driveway. :-(  For a brief moment I convince myself that we could go
in the Thing...then Liz gives I that &quot;Yoohoo, reality is over here&quot;
look and I go back to staring at the '67 Resto from Hell's first
cousin [not wanting to steal any wind from VanBondo...I saw the
pics...he wins...though I am still convinced that Ras Split is between
25 and 30% body-fill].  This is the second trip I haven't been ready
for... Last autumn, I had a six week contract in Mexico City and was
planning to drive down when the brakes and clutch got another notion
in their collective metallic mind.  Now that brake job has turned into
a complete suspension overhaul....  

Now it is starting to look like the furthest I will get this summer is
Cape Breton [approx 800K] ...don't get I wrong, it is beautiful up
there, but we are going for a wedding...

So I am appealing to all of you for a bit of a boost... maybe those of
us not heading for the Artic Circle should start planning next year's
big caravan...some form of motivation for the continuing resto and a
goal for which Ras Split may actually be ready.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks....Oh, my!

Roy
