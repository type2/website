Subject: Back-up lights

I've noticed that my back-up lights are not going on when I shift my
automatic into Reverse.  If I push the shift lever slightly forward beyond
Reverse, (bordering on putting it into Park), then I guess proper contact is
being made and the lights will go on.

Is there a simple fix for this?  Many thanks.
