Subject: Re: Lean running - any risks?

&gt; &gt;Dreaming of 26 mpg... :-)

Easy.  This is how you do it:

  1. Never exceed 45 mph.
  2. Never drive *up* hills (down is fine though)
  3. Never load the van with more than the driver and 1/2 tank of gas

If you follow these instructions carefully you might even get 27 mpg!

:)

Seriously though, aerodynamics, driving habits &amp; conditions will affect
mileage more than that last little bit of tuning.

On the mechanical side, avoid trying for the best mileage - instead, try
for the best power.  As you get more power (by tuning, lower restriction
exhaust/intake, proper lubrication, ancillary friction reduction &amp;
etc.), you're burning the fuel you are using more efficiently/more
completely.  You'll also then see improved mileage - as a side effect,
as it were.
