&gt;Here's a weird one.  My tranny has been sitting on the floor
&gt;of the garage for 3 months, waiting for the engine to be done.
&gt;I put both back in the beast couple days ago, didn't bother to hook
&gt;up the CV's, and started it up.  Afterwards, noticed a bit
&gt;of trans oil at the front of the tranny, on
&gt;the drivers-side corner where the tranny mount is.
&gt;
&gt;The oil continues to appear, looking a bit foamy; the amount
&gt;seems to be proportional to how long the engine is run.
&gt;Nothing like this has ever happened before!  There is
&gt;a certain amount of suspicious looking old greasy dirt around
&gt;that area but then that's true of the entire rear end so go
&gt;figure.

There is a small vent hole at the top of the front housing.  If tranny was
sitting on floor of unheated garage, it may have water in it from
condensation.  That will cause the oil to foam.  You may also have rust in
it.  The other possibility is that the trans is over-filled.  Check level
with van on a level surface or lift.  Not with it on jack stands on one end.
