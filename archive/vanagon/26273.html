Subject: '65 4SALE IN AUSTIN

Hey now,
        One owner '65 Type II for sale at the junkyard next to Austin
VeeDub. Asking $600. I looked it over yesterday, if I had $600 I'd probably
take it. Doesn't look like it's run for a while, registration expired in
'87. Body's in pretty good shape; either has original engine, or one from
same year model (engine codes match up), somewhat rust-free. I didn't crawl
under for rust inspections as the tall weeds were not my thing, and I don't
have $600, but the engine compartment seemed resaonably rust free, the only
bad spot I could find was in the rear cargo/passenger area, looks like it
leaked in and pooled. Kinda rough, but in Austin it's hard to find splits
at all, let alone decent ones. I have nothing to do with this bus or it's
owner, and you now know as much as I do about it.

Peace,
