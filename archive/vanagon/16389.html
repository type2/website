sounds good, please post the info when you  get it&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As I've mentioned before, for some of us in NY, New England, and from
&gt; the more Eastern Reaches of the Great White North....there is the
&gt; Ben &amp; Jerry's Volkswagen Van Show which is usually held in Vermont
&gt; in Mid-June. I don't have the date yet...but I suppose when the
&gt; next propaganda sheet from LiMBO comes out it should be listed.
&gt; 
&gt; Howaboutit?
