Subject:  Re:Sticky valve 

&gt;next, i wish to ask if there is anyway to stop a valve that seems to be 
&gt;sticking from doing so? or does it mean i gotta do a valve jobby?

You might want to try som &quot;Top Oil&quot;. This is a gas additive that purports
to lubricate the valve train. I remember my father used some once to 
clear up a sticky valve problem.

Its cheap, and worth a try. Get it in the 'magic tincture' section of 
any big auto supply Canadian Tire type store.
