Subject: Re: Oldest Bus in Britain

Peter is not on the net, unfortunately. Are you a member of NEATO? There is a
wealth of help advice and friendship, but I guess you are probably into
allnthat anyway (but any old bus freaks who aren't  - why?). Any help or
anything I or SSVC can offer is willingly there, just e mail me direct is
best.
Love to se a photo and hear how the resto progresses. Meanwhile Charlie
Highgate is bringing his '52 Kombi with hood air vent and opening flyscreen
rear safari and also an AMAZING '52 Pick Up to the Volksworls Show nr London
in March. This show will be MIGHTY!
This pick up has just blown our PR guys mind he says &quot;wow its the cleanest
straightest unrestored Bus I have ever seen..never weldee or painted and
totally original including NOS Tarpaulin cover and frame, NOS spare wooden
slats and two unique NOS spare rear corner  ...and ...spare NOS ribbed
semaphores!
The van is being retsore to former glory by Charlie prios to it going to its
new home in Ireland. I plan catching a drool before it departs! Dave :)
