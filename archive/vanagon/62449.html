 &gt;yup. that's what it says:
 &gt;
 &gt;&quot;1985 Discovery Volkswagen Camper, LT400, imported, self-contained, loaded,
 &gt; new motor, 6-cyl., diesel, 5 spd., 18 mpg, brakes, tires, winch, shower,
 &gt; stove, sleeps 5, many extras, parts, all paper work, parts all avail. in
 &gt; US, $18,700 obo  (818) 735-7963&quot;
 &gt;
 &gt;which is, i think, a Burbank, CA area code. this is the much larger van,
 &gt;built by VW and MAN (of Austria). it looks somewhat like the Vanagon/T3,
 &gt;but is larger. an LT400 (they start at LT250, i think) is a BIG truck. :)
 &gt;
 &gt;might be worth a look-see, if you live in the area. :)
 &gt; &gt;&gt;

For those east coasters who might be interested in a LT series motorhome
also, there's one for sale in Jersey. Cheaper too, I think.  It may actually
be at the Atco NJ (Hotco :&lt;) VW show this coming sunday the 13th.
I'll be there gettin burned to a crisp, as usual.....
