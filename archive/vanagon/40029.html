&gt;Thanks for the info about the foamy green stuff.  I do run the bus on the
&gt;highway, but I also tend to take short trips and I really only noticed it
&gt;when it got cold. Again thanks.

Seems to me that foamy green stuff in the oil would indicate the presence of
anti-freeze. I could understand regular moisture being in the oil, but
anti-freeze?? If it were me, I'd start looking for leaks somewhere.
