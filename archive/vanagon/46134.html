&gt; I agree, it would seem unwise to do all the work, then have it fail 
again. On the other hand the fan in my '85 Jetta has squealed on &amp; 
off for at least 2 years now, or about 70k driven daily, with the fan 
*always* on. Since it takes 7 seconds (ok, maybe 10... ;) to remove 
the fan in a Jetta, I just oil it whenever it bugs me enough. (only 
had to do it about 3-4 times in 2 years...) 

I'm not sure how the fan compares to my '88 Westy though, since I've 
never *seen* the d*mn thing!

The Jetta and Vanagon fans at least look the same. I agree, it's a pain
to get to the Vanagon fan. Mine burned completely, and I was forced
to swap it (Defroster fan is good to have at the redlights in NY state).
Bought the replacement at a local Borsch parts place, not dealer, for $90.
