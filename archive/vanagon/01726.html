Subject: 80 Vanagon with 88 Rabbit motor

Yes, it's true. In my hunt for a bus I've found someone that has put a Rabbit
motor into an old air-cooled Vanagon. I haven't looked at it yet, but on
the phone the owner didn't know where they stuck the radiator - the work
was done
at a local shop by the previous owner. Current owner says it runs great,
although she did have to replace a cracked exhaust manifold recently.
Is this as much of a kludge as it sounds? (I'm still new at this and I'm
beginning to see the engine swaps - something a local mechanic advised me
to
stay away from.

Other ones I'm seeing: 81 ASI with a newer engine, and 87 Westfalia with
motor rebuilt at 87K - because the water seals were starting to leak I've
been told.
