Subject: Re: Finally going to part out the 69

I wil go pull the pull's :-)  tonight. Are you talking about the light 
 with the two switch setup? I have it but one of the thin nuts holding 
 the switch in has been replaced with a BIG nut, if you want it I will 
 throw it in the box.  The heater is complete without the control 
 switch, I havent fired it up but the shafts all spin free and nothing 
 feels, looks, tastes broken

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am finally going to part out my 69 westy, I thought I had a guy that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  was going to buy it whole so I delayed the organ donations. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have-
&gt;&gt;&gt; Complete westy camping interior,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Windows 
&gt;&gt;&gt; most outside trim
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1600 single port (runs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tranny
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stewart Warner gas heater in questionable condition
&gt;&gt;&gt; And much much more-
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; E-mail pronto  I am putting it into the paper today also.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; AND I forgot who wanted the Cabinet latches?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Me me  me!  I need 3  of 'em if you have them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;One more interior item that I may need is the adjustable light above the 
&gt;&gt;'lil table.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What's questionable about the heater?   I may be game to try fixing it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I sure wish you lived across town.  I'd be on my way over right now.
&gt;&gt;Wow.  A whole (running) engine!
