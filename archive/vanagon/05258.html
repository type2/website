Subject: Re: Small on Safety (Was: those cab separators)


	&quot;Small... On Safety&quot; is a thoroughgoing hatchet job. It reduced my
opinion of Mr. Nader from &quot;gadfly&quot; to &quot;jerk&quot;, and he's yet to redeem himself.
My favorite gross untruth in the book is his punative &quot;Crush distance&quot;
for a Transporter and for a 69 or Ford Galaxy Station Wagon. Someone
at Nader's Center For Automotive Safety forgot that there's an *engine*
in the front of the Ford and showed the whole distance from bumper to
pedal's as &quot;Crush distance&quot;. In one of today's Benz or Volvo products, yes.
In a Ford ?!?!?! Get a grip!
	Having owned a Corvair, I can confirm every evil thing he ascribes
to them in Unsafe At Any Speed, but I don't anymore. Like most extremists, I
just don't trust him around facts.

	I *like* Mark's theory about 70's single car bus accidents. But
I have had long term relationships with several busses, including one I
owned, and they were indeed susceptible to side-winds. Alas how many 
people can't pay attention, and demand that I don't either.
