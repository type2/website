Subject: bodega update


Here's the current roster of those planning to attend Bodega Dunes, June 
2-4th.  If there is a question mark on your line, I'd appreciate hearing from 
you.  I still need more sign ups for the potluck items (see below).  Breakfasts 
for Saturday and Sunday are being handled by Jeff Schneiter and All Knoll, the 
willing early-risers.  Jack Stafford has kindly volunteered to bring his 
Coleman oven, which fits atop a stove, in case anyone has the baking urge.  
Lunch is do-your-own, btw.  Do we have a BBQ ceo volunteer?      

The groupings in the first section represent those who's made arrangements to 
share a campsite.  If you're in the second section, you may wish to link up 
with someone to share.  Optimal plan will be to arrive early on Friday, to get 
the best adjacent sites.
