&gt; Can this be done? My Chevy (no flames please) truck needs a new transmission

&gt; do anything too foolish.

Foolish is my middle name! (ha ha)  I pulled an engineless 66 Deluxe Bus
45 miles with my 84 Wasser without any problems, both city and highway
driving.  I wouldn't try to 'lug' an aircooled motor too much, but it can
be done.  I bet you got a good deal on the splittie bus to travel 1000
miles to get it!  8-)  [I'm the seller]
