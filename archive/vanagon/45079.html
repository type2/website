Subject: Further Festival and VWs



hey now,

went to the further festival in raleigh, nc last night...wow, haven't 
seen so many busses in a long, long time. mostly breadloafs...saw one 
splittie, but seeing all them busses makes me want mine back!!!!!!

if anyone is going to any other further festivals, there is a vendor inside
selling some shirts with vw's on them....nicely handrawn prints...i went 
to get one but he had already packed up..the one i want has a picture of 
a splittie with the words &quot;I love you more then words can tell&quot; and 
jerry's dob and dod on it. if someone would pick this shirt up for me i 
would gladly send $$$.
