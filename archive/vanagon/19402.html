&gt;We should discuss this....
&gt;It seems to me that the van/bus owners have much more in common than their
&gt;motors. For us vanagon types it will mean having to make cross-postings to
&gt;both AC &amp; WC in rec.autos.
&gt;A division similar to that used for repair manuals i.e.&quot;VW Vanagon
&gt;1980-1991&quot; would work as well and allow for the AC &amp; WC types to live in
&gt;the same space - thereby preserving continuity of VW lore, expertise, and
&gt;evolution.

my understanding is that it (the division) is primarily for the beetles/ghia
crowd versus the rabbit/jetta/whatever crowd. we buses have more or less
been left out of the consideration (as there are waaaay fewer of us than
of the beetles, ghias, rabbits, golfs, jettas, passats, quantums, corrados,
and whatever else them little things is called).

which is why this list was started (more or less ... i really think Gerry
was just bored! :) ... cause there was too much &quot;beetle&quot; on the VINTAGEVW
list, and not everybody could get to rec.autos.vw (and be swamped by the
water-pumping front-wheel driving dinkies). so here we are.

&gt;What think you all? There is probably enough people on this list to have a
&gt;significant swing vote.

regrettably, i don't get rec.autos.vw with any consistency, so i'm kinda of
the optinion that maybe i shouldn't voice a vote on this. THIS list is more
than enough for me (with a few side-trips to snoop around other vw-related
stuff here and there), but i personally think it would probably be a good
thing. i'm not crazy about the names that were chosen, but then i didn't get
a vote on the weather, either. :)

but the rabbits and golfs and such seem to be young folks of lessened interest
in history and tradition of VW per se. just as the beetle folks don't seem to
care much for buses and 411/412's and porsche 914's and even porsches in
general (cause the porsche folks all seem to be snobs anyway ... well, a large
number of them). so i think it would be better for them (and the beetle people)
that the rabbits/golfs would go off together in their own group. those of us
who DO care about history and traditon will just have to read more and faster.
:)

so think about it. make up your mind, one way or the other. and when the
gizmo comes out, vote. if you can't get rec.autos.vw, then maybe don't vote.

and, no, i'm not sure any of this makes any sense. i have a headache. i just
got back from talking to the insurance people and i am NOT happy. :(
