Well, I was once again reminded that there _is_ a hell, when I went to
DMV this AM to register the '54.

I guess it wasn't that bad - I showed up 15 minutes before they opened, 
but it still took about 1/2 hour to process a simple transaction.
Slower than molasses in January, in Juneau.

Now the '54 is _officially_ mine, but I have to drag it down there
for VIN verification still.
