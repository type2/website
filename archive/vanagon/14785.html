Subject: :) PIRATED JOEL MESSAGES DISCOVERED

The message (reproduced below) which purported to be an emination from the
High King of Vanagonia is a blatent FRAUD!!!

Since when have you seen the esteemable Professor Walker use CAPITAL letters?

Schponfirkle...

&gt;On Saturday, APRIL FOOL'S DAY (also known as ALL FOOL'S DAY),
&gt;             Will Self, that much-maligned Montana munchkin, said:
&gt;&lt;some idiotic garbage about President Clinton and a dispicable conspiracy
&gt;of the Big Three Automakers, in cooperation with the Japanese government
&gt;deleted for sanitary reasons&gt;
&gt;&gt;...       Clinton promised significant tax breaks to any U.S. citizen
&gt;&gt;who trades in any Volkswagen vehicle in exchange for an American-made
&gt;
&gt;this is a misquote: actually, Clinton promised &quot;stiff and fantastic brakes&quot;
&gt;for the exchane. Unfortunately, it was not specified exactly what constituted
&gt;&quot;American-made&quot; automobiles, as NONE of the Ford, GM, or Chrysler products
&gt;are totally made in the U.S.  ALL of their products have significant portions
&gt;built and/or assembled in Mexico (GM and Ford) and Canada (GM and Chrysler).
&gt;Honda Accord has the highest percentage of &quot;American-made&quot; for any car sold
&gt;in the U.S. Market.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;one by midnight tonight.  VAN2--Volkswagens Are Nightmares To Work On--
&gt;&gt;is a Tuscaloosa, Alabama based organization.
&gt;
&gt;remember, folks: by Midnight tonight. or you turn into a pumpkin.
&gt;
&gt;VAN2 is a purely vindictive group of ex-Faculty members from the University
&gt;of Alabama, currently residing at the Taylor Hardin Facility for the
&gt;Criminally Insane, P. O. Box 666, Tookalooka, Amabala, 3540shit. Any and all
&gt;correspondence will be opened and read. No sharp objects are permitted. Any
&gt;sedatives or relaxants would be appreciated.
