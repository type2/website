Subject: Weekenders &amp; Westy Weekenders &amp; Wolfsburg Westy Weekenders.....

Here's my input on Weekenders.

VW made a rear seat option that it called the Weekender Package.  It
consisted of a rear seat that folded down and when combined with the cushion
over the engine made a bed.  Sometimes people call the Vanagons with this
option a Weekender.

VW made Camper models that had complete kitchen units in them along with the
pop-top.  Usually these were called the Vanagon Camper GL.  Other Camper
models were built that only had a pop-top and sometimes an electric
refrigerator, but no kitchen stuff.  These Campers without the kitchen are
often called Weekenders or Westy Weekenders.  Still other Camper models were
built as Wolfsburg Editions that did not have the kitchen stuff.  These could
be called Weekenders, Westy Weekenders, or for the verbose, Wolfsburg Westy
Weekenders.

There was also a special edition Wolfsburg Westy Weekender that was sold
exclusively in Worland, WY.  Since Worland is located in Washakie County,
this edition would be called the Worland Washakie Wyoming Wolfsburg Westy
Weekender, or just WWWWWW for short.  :)

I really was serious up to the last paragraph.
