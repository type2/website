Subject: WTB:Vanagon Crew/Double Cab

I want that gorgeous burgundy TriStar Synchro that resides in Canada!
Short of that, do any of you have some bonafide insight in obtaining 
a Vanagon Crew? 
I have an impeccable Red '90 Carat (RED BUS) I'd offer as a downpayment! :)
Please, if any info., I'g greatly appreciate it.
