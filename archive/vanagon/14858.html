Subject: Re: queries about spilled oil


        &gt;&gt;-How do you get spilled, used oil out of your new, light-colored
&gt;&gt;bus carpet?  That's what'cha get for being mr. enviro- recycling is not
&gt;&gt;always so noble- especially when it lands on your rug, not in the Texaco
&gt;&gt;used oil receptacle.

I have found that spraying WD-40 on carpet, and blotting it up with a clean
paper towels works wonders. Use plenty of WD-40 as you go. Once you have
removed the oil, use warm soapy water and a sponge to remove the WD-40. Try
it- you will be amazed! How do I know? After working as a mechanic for 7
years., one learns how to clean the mistakes!
