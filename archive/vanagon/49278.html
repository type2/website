Subject: CCC's 9/20 trip particulars


Greetings and thanks for all of your responses.  Looks like we'll
have a good turn out.  It seems everyone wants to come to this because
Dave Schwarze and Joel Walker are coming from so far away.  :)

Kathy Myers has spent hours/days on our behalf securing reservations
for us. (thanks Kathy!).  This turned out to be a big bunch of bureaurocratic
red tape and a lot of conflicting time and trouble for her, so we
owe her big time on this one.  Not wanting her to have to take
the financial responsibility of footing the bill, too, I've snt
her a check for $223, to cover the cost of Friday and Sat. nite for
all of us to cover the credit card charge she had to give them to
secure this spot.  Therefore, when all of us arrive, we'll see how
many there are, and divide accordingly, and you can all pay me
back.  :)  Obviously, the more people each of you can coerce into
joining us, the cheaper it will be for all of us.  Nevertheless, if
the 25 or so vehicles which have signed up to come DO come, this
should turn out to be not too expensive.  Just make sure you all
show up!  

Kathy suggests bringing table cloths, since the tables there are
worn.  Looks like some biking will be possible too, so feel to
rack up.  Kathy thinks there should be no problem with passes
being closed.  She feels even if it does snow, that the snow wuld
be removed (rather than left and the pass closed) at this early
time. YOu may want to bring chains/cables/spikers just &quot;in case.&quot;
She says to expect very nice weather, but it may go to extremes, so
I personally plan to bring layers.

Yes, people will be bringing children.  Of all ages.  

Food: how about a Mexican/Spanish/Latino theme?  Kathy suggested
this, cuz she's in the mood for chicken mole, and it sounded good
to me, so I second the nomination.  Rather than try and compulsively
organize this, how about just everyone bring interesting things to
share?  For dinner and breakfast, I mean.  Lunch tends to be on
yer own, or leftovers the racoons didn't get.  HOMEBREW ESPECIALLY
WELCOME, and the amount of people in our &quot;group&quot; into this is
getting staggering.  So also are the rest of us once we drink it.

Suggestions are open to caravaning/carpooling, at least from the
Bay Area (southern CA volks - feel free to make your arrangements
on this).  Some of you have indicated being able to leave at
various times on Thursday and Friday.  Would be fun if we
can get together, especially with CB's.

CB's - by habit, we tend to use channel 2, as in Type 2.  Hardly
anyone has SSB, to answer one question on that.
