Malcolm,

You anticipated my suggestion... that we make the run to arrive in Ushuaia
in time for Christmas, and then hang around a week to celebrate the turning
of the millenium (New Years, 2001) there.  We could even use that week for
a jog down to Antarctica!  That way we can do the trip to celebrate TWO
milleniums. (The popular '2000' and the accurate '2001'!)

According to Tom Forhan (mailto:tforhan_at_pipeline_dot_com), Ushuaia is a
cosmopolitan city.  There is one 4-star hotel there, and I'm sure that with
adequate reservations, we could find a wonderful party (or make one of our
own.)
