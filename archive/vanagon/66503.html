Subject:      Re: Sagging on one side - Westys

Here it is once again, as posted 2 days ago:
This is kind of an unconventional fix, but it sure leveled out my westy.
   I used the upper spring seat as a pattern and cut a round spacer of the
same size, with a hole of the same diameter in the center.  I used a thin
blade jig
saw to cut it out of a 1/2&quot;solid plastic board.  I inserted the spacer
between the upper spring seat and the car frame.  See chapter 42.2 in the
Bentley manual. Don't use a spacer more than a 1/2&quot; thick.
The washers are doing just fine.  The tires seem to be ok too.  The car
handles a bit nicer on right turns,  especially when heavily loaded.

It was fun to hear that Uncle Corbin had the same idea.
To answer Kelly's question:
No, I don't think it does any harm to drive with a slightly leaning van.  I
only discovered this after I built my new garage. At first, I thought my
new garage was leaning.  To my relief, it was just my westy.

&gt; I AM NEW TO THE LIST, BUT MY UNCLE CORBIN, PUT NYLON  SPACERS ABOVE THE
&gt; SPRINGS AND HAVE LASTED 40000K . IT IS STILL LEVEL AND TIRES ARE STILL
&gt; HOLDING UP.

&gt; &gt; &gt;My thinking is that the left springs have sagged a bit because of the
&gt; &gt; extra &gt;weight.
&gt; &gt; &gt;So, what would happen if I got a spring compressor and swapped the
&gt; &gt; &gt;springs left to right? The weaker left springs would go on the right.
&gt; &gt; Would &gt;this have the result of leveling out the Van?
&gt; &gt; &gt;Or is this an exercise in futility?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please excuse my lack of knowledge.  Is there significant harm in
driving
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; bus with a slight sag?  What are the implications?
