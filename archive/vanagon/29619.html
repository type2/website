     Psychic Trucker, asked:

     &gt;Did you all figure out what we could throw in our vanagons while i
     &gt;was away,i may be a prime candidate...


     If you want to just throw it it....

     You can put in a  911 engine with a kit from Martin Schneider for
     about $1800. Then you add a 3.2 or later 911 engine, used from a
     wrecker this would be say $7500. This is a very clean,easy
     installation. If you need to save some money , you can get an older
     911 engine, but they are taller and you have to raise the engine lid,
     not a solution for those of us with Westies who want to use that space
     for sleeping.

     The big problem is heat, i.e. you are putting a aircooled
     engine into a watercooled bus, with heating/defrosting system designed
     for hot water ( and which, incidently, works well). Martin -who lives
     in Southern California- uses some sort of electric heater,  but if you
     want to use your GL during those Vermont winters you gotta problem.
     One unexplored solution is to replace the two heater cores with oil
     coolers, and run the oil lines up front.

     Syncro owners have a second problem: excess power: we hear Martin
     needs to get his Syncro tranmission rebuilt every 18 mos, this is
     confirmed by Ottinger not selling its 180HP $30,000 six cylinder
     engine to Syncro owners because they say it has too much power.

     It will be more work than the Porsche, but way less less cash to go
     with an non-turbo Audi, which offers several advantages.  The engines
     are silky smooth and bulletproof, often going 200K without the heads
     off. They are also unappreciated, available from a wrecker for
     something like $700. They produce about 35% more horsepower and torque
     than stock VW, but this is not excessive and should not damage
     powertrain components. The maximum torque is available at 4000 rpm, at
     18mph/1000 rpm in 4th gear, the vehicle should cruise right up those
     mountain passes at illegal speeds. Of course, it is water cooled, so
     no heater problem.

     The problems are the fit. First, we know that some Vanagons were sold
     outside the US with this or a similar engine. Perhaps bellhousings are
     available, or maybe we need an adapter.  We know the engines are not
     too long. Other problems might be height (we can tilt it a bit, if
     necessary) and depth for Syncros, which  have a system of steel beams
     and plates under the powertrain for offroad protection, this could
     interfer with a stock oilpan. The Transplant Task Force has a couple
     of volunteers interested in design and custom machining of the
     required parts.

     So, though a 911 engine will go in pretty easily, it has problems and
     is very expensive. The Audi engine is cheap, is well suited to the
     application, but we are not certain on the fitting details.  Even the
     cheapest early 911 engine is going to run a coupla grand. The Audi
     savings could used to engineer proper solutions, and there are several
     people interested in seeing this through.

     I've flogged these ideas to a few listmembers whose engines seem to
     be reaching the end of the road. I'm certain the Task Force would be
     glad to provide more advice and real help to whoever is first in line.

     Meanwhile, we are still looking for a test mule...

     For the Transplant Task Force,
