Subject: March CCC's camping


OK, volks - time to decide.  We have the interest to do a campout
on one of the weekends in the last 1/2 of March, but we need collectively
to decide which weekend.

Location needs to be determined as well.  So far, we have a nice,
concrete suggestion to camp mid-way between SF and LA, sort of
near San Luis Obispo or Santa Barbara.

Let me know your thoughts on both, and I'll tally them.  Thanks..
