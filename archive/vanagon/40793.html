Subject: 	Re: 87: follow up on leaking head

In a message dated 96-04-27 12:40:00 EDT, you write:

&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking about replacing a leaking head bolt. Is there anything to 
this
&gt;process other than removing the old bolt and replacing it with a new bolt
&gt;that is sealed with the Bolt Prep stuff, and torquing it to spec? Do I 
have
&gt;to loosen all of the head bolts and retorque in sequence? Anything else I
&gt;should know?
&gt;
&gt;

I usually just repalce the one.  I know that you will never get the 
clamping
force identical to the bolts, but it should work out just fine.
