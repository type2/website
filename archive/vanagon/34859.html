Subject: Re: '85 Fan Resistor

&gt;Where is the ressistor for the fresh air fan up front? I was told it's 
&gt;somewhere behind the glovebox, but I didn't see anything when I looked. 
&gt;
&gt;What should it look like and where should it be. I'm hoping that 
&gt;replacing it will make my front fan work again.

Regarding the fan, also check the actual switch which operates the fan, (on
the H/V/A/C panel) i found the cause of a non-working fan to be a totally
fried switch, i replaced it and everything was fine.
