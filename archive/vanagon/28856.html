Subject: Re: Westy/Vgon performance

Acceleration in the 83 aircooled 2.0 Westy from 35/40mph to 70 on flat
surface is about a week and a half. My gas mileage really, really sucks.
Going uphill is basically white knuckle time with everyone on my bumper. Out
side of that, I love it!!! Kinda like a fat ugly, blind,  chick with no
manners, no brains,  AIDS but with  a nice personality. ;)
