Subject: RE: O2 sensors, setting air mixture

Remember the &quot;good old days&quot; when you could tune a carb by sound/feel?

Guess what, you can actually do it on (at least the 2.1 liter) Vanagon
engine with good results.  I had to get an emission inspection 2 weeks
ago.  Lacking any measutrement, I manipulated the mixture screw (allen 
socket inthe air mass meter) and the idle screw much the same as 
the old carb.
(all this with O2 and idle control disconnected and the engine hot)

e.g. slow idle, lean till it doesn't run well, richen, iterate.

The result: .05 CO - the book calls for .07.
Luck?  Maybe, but I've gotten away with this twice with 2 different
motors with about the same result.
