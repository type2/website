Subject: Holiday Trek, meet bus owners?


When life gets boring, it's time to plan an adventure.  My adventure
will be taking me from Atlanta to Newark, to Boston, to Kansas City,
then drive a bus I am buying back to Atlanta.

I am wondering if there are any list members that might want to get
together and knock back a couple of 'Coca-Colas' and swap stories/
lies about buses.  (and also help me find a few parts to complete
my 1960 Westfalia)  :)

I won't be able to make any stops on the drive from Atlanta to Newark, 
but I will be in Boston from December 17-20 &amp; would like to meet any 
of you in that area.  From there I will fly to Kansas City and meet
with Jon Christensen to purchase the 65 bus.  After checking out the 
bus to assure that it is roadworthy, I will begin my 2 day drive back
to Atlanta.

One stop I want to make is Westphalia, Missouri for a Kodak moment
similar to Rick Babor's in the 1996 NEATO calender (shameless plug...
what, you still haven't joined???).

Anyone that would like to get together (or anyone that needs a ride)
anywhere between Kansas City &amp; Atlanta please let me know.  Also
looking for pointers for junkyards and cheesy roadside attractions
along the way.

Best wishes for a Happy &amp; Adventure Filled Holiday!
