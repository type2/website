Subject: RE: &quot;dry&quot; door locks



&gt;the door locks on my bus feel &quot;dry&quot; when I turn the key in them.  They
&gt;work fine, just don't feel smooth.  What can I squirt in them to lubricate?

WD-40 was designed, formulated, manufactured, made, constructed,
perfected, and maybe blessed by the Lord Himself for this application.
Look for the blue spray can with the yellow label at any auto parts store,
K-mart, Target, Wal-mart, most dime stores (remember dime stores?),
and grocery stores in the Hardware or Auto sections. The can usually
has a short red spray tube taped to the side of the can, ideal for pushing
aside that little cover place that VW locks usually have and spraying the
stuff directly into the lock.

BTW, get the tall can instead of the short can, and a roll of paper towels.
Go around back, open the engine compartment, and spray anything that
should be shiny and clean but isn't. A good wipedown with the paper towels,
and your engine and surrounding sheet metal will look brand new. Even
works on spark plug wires, but don't get it into the connectors on the
distributor or on the plugs.
