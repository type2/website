Subject: Tech tip #2

       Here's technical tip #2:

       At the weekend VW show in E. Ohio we did a brake inspection
       on Vanagon rear brakes. It took us about 3 hours to get both
       rear drums off. The first problem was the lugs were on
       with about 1000 ft./lb's. (we bent my best 4 way wrench)
       Next problem was the brake drum center hole was good and 
       rusted to the axle.

       The fix: grease!

       I found the the VW lugs are very precision fit. Over
       tightening along with rust is the problem. Grease on the 
       threads and using a torch wrench, will prevent further
       problems here.

       As for the centering hole: sand this area and the axle
       with sandpaper to remove rust. Then coat the entire matting
       areas with grease. WARNING: WIPE IT OFF, Yes use a rag and
       wipe the grease off. This area requires rust protection 
       but any considerably amount of grease in this area will be 
       thrown out to the brake. So you must WIPE IT OFF, leaving
       only a very thin film of grease to prevent rust.

       Now... Do you think the next time the corner mechinic
       has to check your brakes, he is going to take the time
       to do these things??? I bet he even has his air
       gun (wrench) turned up full when he puts on the lugs!
