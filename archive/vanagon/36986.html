So Jack Stafford says:
&gt; 
&gt; I was given a bra about 10 years ago.  It fits right, but I found
&gt; that worn for extended periods of time caused some chafing.  Pine
&gt; needles and other debris found their way inside and trapped moisture
&gt; which probably led to cancer under the windshield. No pun indended.

It takes me 30 sec. to remove or install 'The Beasts' bra.  And yes,
I remove/install it all the time.  Anal?  MMmmmaybe, but I have no
nicks or scratches other than one minor dent caused by a semi tossing
a *major* piece of pavement that impacted the front of the van with
a vengeance.  If the bra wasn't there, the damage would have been
much worse.
