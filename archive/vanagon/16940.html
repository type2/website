Subject: Gasket Sealant Question

  OFFICE MEMO          Gasket Sealant Question                Date:5/5/95

I'm ready to put the coolant flanges back on my '85 vanagon after putting the
head back on, but am unsure of what to use for gasket sealant. Bentley 
doesn't mention any sealant for them, it just says to always replace the
gasket.  That seems odd (the sealant part, not the gasket replacement
part)because in other areas it specifies what sealant to use, like the
waterjacket gasket and the head nuts. I can't believe you should put these
things on without sealant, but I also can't find a sealant that specifically
says for aluminum engines. VW wanted to sell me some overpriced tube of stuff
that said it was for sealing engine housings and gearbox housing, and that
sure doesn't seem correct.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Don Kane
