&gt; &gt;From this yankee's understanding of the situation, the only way
&gt; you can become a citizen of the grand and glorious state of
&gt; Alabama is to prove your family tree extends no further than to
&gt; your brothers and sisters.

I thought Alabamians family trees stopped branching and started
looping.
