&gt;Too many folks around here seem to think the older backwards engines are
&gt;better.  I disagree.  Cheaper I will grant them though.  They just envy
&gt;our engine power, heat and A/C.


Not all of us.   &gt;8-p

Steve Maher    smaher_at_gi_dot_com    '80 V6anagon: faster, quieter, &amp; warmer
                                   than a speeding EV; and longblock is $650
                                '71 VW Transporter... great personality
