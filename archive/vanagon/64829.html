Subject:      Re: Brake pads

&gt;
&gt; My original pads died at about 60K, I discovered they were gone on a Sunday
&gt; P.M., I knew the dealerwas closed, I saw an ad for a brake &quot;special&quot; at
&gt; Firestone, so away I went.  Of course they found the wheel cylinders were
&gt; shot (?), so I had to spring for a new set ($70).  As I drove home
&gt; afterwards, I found my leg was bouncing up and down about 3 inches whenever
&gt; I put on the brakes.  I took it back a few days later to have them fix it,
&gt; it was marginally better unless the brakes got hot, then it was horrible.
&gt; When the pads wore out six months later, I found they had turned the rotors
&gt; down to about 8mm! No, they didn't wear down that far, because there was no
&gt; &quot;lip&quot; on the edge.

So, the moral of the story is to stay away from Firestone?  Or don't
trust anybody?

I replaced the rotors, put on semi-metallics, found
&gt; those to be grabby, so I went to the dealer and bought OEM pads.  Oh yeah,
&gt; the rear cylinders that they put on were leaking by this time, so I had to
&gt; replace them as well ($12 from NAPA, lifetime guarantee).  The OEMs wore
&gt; out in 20K miles, three times as fast as the originals, go figure.  I
&gt; recently put on a set of NAPA lifetime pads (organic) and I've been pretty
&gt; happy with them, so far.

Well, with 141k and still lots to go on my pads I shoudn't worry about
it.  But I'm not happy with my stopping distance. No way can I lock up
the wheels!  Was thinking about replacing the pads anyway to see if I
could get better stopping power.  What think?
