Hellow fellow volksowners!

Couple of quick things this fine Friday morning!  

Well, the '57 Deluxe is looking GREAT!  I had my 60's bumpers 
repainted salmon, and then put the chrome on, and now they are on the 
bus!  Wow.  Looks a lot better than it did without bumpers.  

I found a pair of NOS 50's BUMPERS!!!  Is that crazy!  I thought so 
when the guy said $800!!!  (No chome either!)  So I'll stick with my 
fake 60's ones.

I was out checking out the VW site in Deutchland, and requested some 
information on the Golf VR6 4-door, and GTI models.  Well they sent a 
FABULOUS package!  With handsigned letter!  I was very impressed to 
say the least.  The literature is all in German.  They are several fabulous 
foldout photos of the VR6 Syncro!

Anyhow, my question is this, is the Syncro model available over here, 
or even available for import.  It is time to replace the old Audi, 
and the Syncro looks GREAT!

Thanks!
