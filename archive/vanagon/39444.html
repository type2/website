Subject: Carb to FI on for my 77 Westy

Hi volks,

I'm getting ready to remove the Weber progressive from my 77 in favour of
fuel injection. The bus seems to be running a lot better since the temp has
gotten above 60F (for the first time this year), but anything below and it
runs like crap at low RPMs. I've got pretty much all the parts I need (I
think...), and have a couple of questions.

1) 'Return' fuel line from pressure regulator. I'm not sure if the line on
my Westy was removed during the carb conversion (I'm just assuming the worst
- I haven't actually poked my head up there yet). Where abouts on the tank
does the line enter? Is there a special fitting? Anything to look out for here?

2) Sealing intake tubes to cylinder head. I've got fresh gaskets, and
faintly remember someone asking a while back if they should use anything to
seal the gaskets to head. Any advice on what to use? Do I need to use anything?

I've got new seals for the injectors, and plan on using new fi rated fuel
line and new hose clamps.

If anyone has undertaken such a project has any useful tidbits of
information, I'd appreciate them.


Thanks in advance,

Dave.
