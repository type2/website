Subject: Re: Passing on EV (or any other VW)

Just wanted to let Matt Decker know he is not alone on the &quot;gotta pass on
this one&quot; sadness.

My wife and I decided to ditch her useless, but expensive Toy-Yoda,
streamline our lives, and Purchase VW # 11 as her car. We are/were looking
for a circa 1987 Westy in the $5-8,000 range. Found one. A/C, clean, the
works. Excited!

While looking, found a PRISTENE 1976 Transporter. Like new, one owner. $900.
My wife loves it. It remainds me of the 1976 Trans. I restored after a motor
fire, and drove for three wonderful years. Too good to pass up?

We shouldn't do both. We don't need three cars, right?  We will have to pass
on one. Right? One or the other wouldn't be reliable, right? We are trying to
streamline, right?

Confused in Farfax, VA
