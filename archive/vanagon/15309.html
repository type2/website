Subject: Funny yet ironic story...

 The other day the clutch cable went in my `72 TransroverWagen. Upon
assessing the remaining cable parts, I thought it would be a novel
idea to make a new one. I used an old aircraft flap cable which
already had one end done (the front U-shaped attachment). To make the
rear threaded end, I machined a piece of threaded rod so that the
cable would slip thru, and I swaged (sp?) a cable holder on, just
after threaded piece. Everything seemed fine and dandy until I
adjusted the tension up and depressed the pedal. In the end, the
problem was cable-stretch. Every time I would adjust the tension, the
cable would further stretch. The next day, after trying many things, I
broke down and called my parts guy. It turned out that a BRAND NEW
cable was only $10.00! Imagine my surprise. I couldn't even PACKAGE
that cable for 10 bucks! Anyhoo, I guess the moral of the story is to
never overestimate VW parts prices. Sometimes you get pleasant results.

Cheers
