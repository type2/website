Subject: Bentley Manual; Thumbs down

My thanks to all the list members concerning repairs I could not have done
without your help.  My $65.00 Bentley manual leaves a lot to be desired for
the shade tree mechanic.
I wish someone would revise it.  My 68-79 Bentley Bus manual and my
Rabbit/Jetta Diesel book were much more geared toward someone doing their
own repair.  Just some thoughts on the subject.

Bill Lund
