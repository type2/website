&gt;Time to change out my gear oil in the std. transmission.  I want to give it
&gt;a rinse before refilling.  I re/re'd with dino-juice last spring, so the oil
&gt;has only one year on it, but I want to try and get some more crud out.  I
&gt;remember a list posting of re/re using a couple of quarts of ATF in the
&gt;trans then driving for a short while.  This supposedly helped flush out
&gt;crud.  Any wise advice on this or other 'rinses' possible would be
&gt;appreciated. Finally, any comments on adding MolySlip trans additive? I
&gt;trust its molybdenum disulphite to protect the trans (no Slick50 thanks!)
&gt;but what about GL rating probs???   Tim Smith

If I remember right you drive syncro. Right!.  Do not rinse the trans out
with anything but what you intend to use as there is about a quart of fluid
that you cannot drain from the front.  The synchronizer hubs are hard costed
with MOLY anyway so I do not think moly aditives will hurt although I
question the need or benifit.  If you believe in the GL 4 issue, than
anything that changes the friction characteristics must be considered.  I
have a syncro transmission with over 130K using Mobil 1 SHC 75w-90 and the
syncros still work great. Even in winter.
