Subject:      head torque on water-cooled engines: a recall

most of you old folks and gopher-able people may have seen this, but i
thought it might be worth posting to the list again. i was looking for
the head-torque on the water-cooled engines, and noticed the one about
the auxillary heater exhaust pipe that someone was talking about. so
everybody take a minute and look through here if you have a vanagon of
any year. you might find something.

Subject: Service Action QL

Dear Volkswagen Owner:

We are writing to inform you that Volkswagen has introduced a service
action program designed to protect the engine in your VW Vanagon,
Camper or Syncro vehicle from possible early expensive repairs.  In
order for you to take full advantage of this program, we ask that you
make an appointment with your authorized VW dealer for the purpose of
retorqueing the cylinder head nuts of the engine in your car.

Problem Description
It is possible that the cylinder head nuts of some of the affected
vehicles may lose some of their tightening torque.  If this happens,
engine coolant could enter the combustion chamber causing the engine
to overheat.  If not corrected, the engine could be damaged,
necessitating expensive repairs.

Description of Repair
While Volkswagen vehicles normally do not require the inspection or
maintenance of cylinder head nuts, we want to make sure as a precaution
that the cylinder head nuts of your engine are properly torqued.
Therefore, your dealer will check the torque and, if necessary, tighten
the nuts to specifications.  This work will take approximately two hours
and will, of course, be done free of charge to you.

Your Action
Please contact the Service Department of your authorized Volkswagen
dealer for an appointment to have the necessary work performed.

Precaution
Prior to having your vehicle corrected, we suggest that you observe the
temperature gauge while driving.  In the event that the indicator
reaches the &quot;Red Mark&quot;, we ask that you stop your vehicle and contact
your Volkswagen dealer.

Volkswagen hopes you will take advantage of this program as it is part
of our commitment to maintain the reliability of our products and the
value of your investment.

Sincerely,

Folker G. Rieflin
Product Compliance Manager

April, 1989

Subject: Recall Campaign PW

Dear Volkswagen Owner:

This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.  Volkswagen has determined
that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in 1986
through early 1989 Volkswagen Vangaon and Camper vehicles.  Our records
show that your car is one of these vehicles involved.

Defect Description
Volkswagen 1986 and 1987 model Vanagon and Camper vehicles are equipped
with an in-line fuel filter which is located between the fuel tank and
fuel pump.

We have found this fuel filter, which is encased in a plastic container,
could allow fuel to seep at the seam of the casing.  We have also found
that under certain climatic and driving conditions the engine's right
side fuel return hose in ALL affected vehicles could become brittle and
subsequently leak fuel.

Leaking fuel could present a risk of fire in the presence of an ignition
source.

Remedy
The in-line fuel filter was intended to filter production residue from
the fuel tank.  It has therefore served its function in the 1986 and
1987 model vehicles and is no longer needed.  As part of the repair
your dealer will remove the fuel filter, if applicable, and replace it
with a straight hose.  Your dealer will also replace the right side fuel
return hose on your engine and then pressure check the complete fuel
system.  This work will take approximately up to one and one half hours
and will, of course, be free of charge.

Your Action
Please contact the Service Department of your authorized Volkswagen
dealer for an appointment.  The necessary parts will be available at
your dealer by April 28, 1989.

Precaution
Prior to having your vehicle corrected, please be alert to any gasoline
odor.  Should you detect any, please contact your dealer immediately.

Service Problem Help
If your dealer fails or is unable to remedy the defect free of charge
within a reasonable time, you may call or write to:
   Volkswagen United States, Inc.
   Attn: Customer Relations
   888 W. Big Beaver Road
   Troy, MI  48099
   Telephone:  (800) 822-8987

If you still cannot obtain satisfaction, you submit a complaint to:
Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S.
Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C.
20590.  Telephone: (800) 424-9393; (Washington, D.C. area: 426-0123).

We regret any inconvenience this matter may cause; however, we are
confident that you would want to have your vehicle corrected as soon as
possible.

Subject: Recall Campaign PB

Dear Volkswagen Owner:

This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

Volkswagen has determined that a defect which relates to motor vehicle
safety exists in 1986 and some early production 1987 model Volkswagen
Vanagon, Camper and Syncro vehicles.  Our records show that you are the
owner of one of these vehicles.

We have determined that if these vehicles are operated with fuel of a
higher &quot;Reid&quot; pressure, fuel vapors could form during hot weather and
become trapped in the fuel filter located inside the fuel tank
(Volkswagen Vanagon and Camper vehicles only).  If this occurs, the fuel
flow to the engine could be restricted and the vehicle could stall.  We
have also found that the usage of high &quot;Reid&quot; pressure fuel could, under
high engine load adn high ambient temperatures, lead to engine stalling
since the main and idle control units are programmed on the basis of
fuel with lower vapor pressure (Vanagons, Campers, including Syncros).
Both conditions present a safety risk, especially in heavy traffic, and
could result in an accident or cause injury.

We urge you to arrange an appointment with your authorized Volkswagen
dealer as soon as possible.  Your dealer will install a new fuel tank
containing a redesigned fuel filter and replace the control unit with a
modified unit IF APPLICABLE.  We estimate that it will take approximately
3 hours to complete the work.  All work will, of course, be free of
charge.  Parts will be available at your dealer on or about May 11, 1987.

If your dealer fails or is unable to remedy the defect free of charge
within a reasonable time, you may call or write the nearest Customer
Assistance office listed in the enclosure.  If you still cannot obtain
satisfaction, please call or write to:

February 1994

Subject: Recall Campaign SU

Dear Volkswagen Owner:

This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.  Volkswagen has determined
that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in some
1986-1991 model Volkswagen Vanagon and Snycro &lt;sic&gt; vehicles equipped
with factory-installed air conditioning.

Our records show that your vehicle is affected by this voluntary recall
action.

Defect Description
Volkswagen has determined that the operation of vehicles on rough roads
could, over time, cause breakage of the plastic material used to attach
the air conditioning flow ducts to the roof.  If this happens, the
center air flow duct could separate from its attachment and fall down,
which could cause injury to passengers sitting in the center seat of
the vehicle.  It could also distract the driver.

Remedy
Your Volkswagen service technician will secure the air flow ducts by
installing a reinforcement bracket. Brackets are available at Volkswagen
repair facilities.

Your Action
Please contact the Service Department of your authorized Volkswagen
retailer for an appointment to have the necessary work performed as soon
as possible.  The repair will take less than one hour and will, of
course, be free of charge.

Precautions
If you notice that the air flow duct mounted to the ceiling is loose,
please contact your authorized Volkswagen retailer immediately and make
sure than no passenger is seated in the center seat below the air duct
until the repair is performed.

Service Problem Help
If your authorized Volkswagen retailer fails or is unable to rememdy
the defect free of charge within a reasonable time, please call or
write to:
   Volkswagen United States, Inc.
   Attn: Customer Relations 3F02-SU
   3800 Hamlin Road
   Auburn Hills, MI  48326-2855
   Toll-free Telephone:  (800) 822-8987

If you still cannot obtain satisfaction, you may file a complaint with:
Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, US
Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C.
20590.  Telephone: 800-424-9393; (Washington, DC area: 202-366-0123).

We regret any inconvenience this matter may cause; however, as part of
our commitment to ensure your safety and maintain your satisfaction with
our product, we would like to repair your vehicle as soon as possible.

Thank you for driving a Volkswagen.
