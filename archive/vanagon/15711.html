Subject: Retro-fitting F.I.

OK, here goes - I've been considering getting a used (junkyard) FI unit and 
installing it on my '73 Campmobile.  I got rid of the dual solex units years 
ago for Del Orto units and now have tons of power, but am paying for it in 
gas.  As I have a 2.0, I feel that the FI is the only other option (BTW - 
anybody ever use a single progressive Weber setup on a 2.0 - what jet sizes?).

1) Is it risky to get a junkyard FI unit?
2) What are all the parts that I should look for?
3) Any idea what this would cost?
4) Anybody have a source locally they can trust?
5) Could I hope to get 18 mpg?
6) Is this a really dumb idea - trading into a nightmare?

TIA

P.S.  The post about breadloaf owners desiring more heat was so true for 
this - I miss my Eberspacher, and it won't fit with the Dels.
