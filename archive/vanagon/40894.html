Subject: drag coefficient

	Drag coefficient is the value you multiply the ACTUAL frontal
area of the bus by to get the actual drag of the bus. Aha you say-
so a bus might have a lower coefficient of drag than a beetle, but
still have MORE drag, because it's got a larger frontal area? Exactly.

	A drag coefficient of 1 means the object has the same drag,
*per square whatever*, as the proverbial brick wall. 0.35 is a typical
value I've heard quoted, and 0.19 is the lowest I've ever heard of.
Some race cars get up to .4x in search of downforce.

	Bill
