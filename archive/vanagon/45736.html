Subject: CCC's bay area explosives extravaganza!


I FEEL THE NEED TO BLOW UP SOMETHING!  :) - AND July 4th is coming up.  I realize
that many of you may already have plans for the 4th, but I'm wondering about
trying to do something this coming weekend.  Either would be ok, actually, I'm
just guessing that we could do more, better, longer, and in a more desireable
location if we called something on, say, Saturday.  Lemme know what you think.

Anyway, here's sort of what I have in mind.  This past weekend, I happened
to need to drive thru Humboldt County, where (unlike in the bay area), they
offer fireworks for sale!  I seized a box of assorted goodies, all of which
(because of CA law) are made to explode on the ground, rather than in
the air (I assume, so that you have a better chance of blowing your foot
off, etc.  :).  Anyway, I'm willing to donate these to the cause, and our
resident explosive/fire/ballistic/pyromanic Bradley has agreed to help
detonate them, doh.  

I'm now trying to think if there's any location within, say 2.5 hours radius
of the Bay Area, maybe somewhere cool with luck, like on a beach or so, where
we could set these off and not end up needing to call the rest of you for
bail.  Bradley said he thought a long time ago this might have been allowed
on the Carmel Beach - does anyone happen to know, or if not there, then other
places where we could do this?  I don't have visions of being responsible for
a fire in a national forest; around a lake or beach seems like a nice, safe
idea.  I thought maybe we could all meet there and have a potluck picnic,
cleanse our systems of the need to bomb and blow up stuff, and then overnight
camping could be optional for those who wish to stay.  With this current
heatwave here, the cooler place the better, in my opinion, so please no one
suggest Red Rock.  :)

Obviously, the more explosives we have, the more drama, so I'd encourage you
ADD types to start building your bottle rockets, etc. NOW, and bring them along
in great quantity.  

I'm pretty excited about this, and willing to organize whatever is needed.  But,
would like to hear from all of you asap.  Will post this to the separate
camping mail alias, as well, so some of you may receive it twice.  Just bring
twice as many things to blow up, and we'll call it even.  :)

RSVP asap!

 Current lust list: a TDI Passat wagon, DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     on to the outside of your shoes, and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.  Thanks!  /m
