Local recycle center.  Cost me a couple of bucks and one garage for 5 
gallons, and free at another.

&gt; I thought the purpose of flushing the coolant was to clear out the
&gt; scum and introduce *fresh* coolant with the chemical additives at
&gt; their highest. (Sorta like changing oil after 3k miles).

Right.  You shoulda seen the little tiny flakes of aluminum that came out 
of there...

&gt; So, this bears the question... Should the coolant be replaced with
&gt; fresh stuff? Or, filter and recycle back into the engine. (I've
&gt; already bought new coolant so I'm changing it anyway).

Never put it back.  It's not that expensive.
