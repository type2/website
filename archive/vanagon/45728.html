So Bren Smith says:
&gt; &gt;&gt;If you deny the existence of god after this encounter, you'll be 
&gt; &gt;&gt;forever damned to driving a VW 412!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hey!  My friend loves her 412!!  :)
&gt; &gt;-Ron Salmon
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, but my idea of hell is having Martha riding shotgun in your 412 
&gt; with a CB permenantly attached to her hand. oooh, shudder! ;-) (sorry 
&gt; Martha!)

Now that IS scarey..... Good Buddy.... ;)
