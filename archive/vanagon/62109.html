Subject: Air Conditioner &quot;Mothballing&quot;

     Kenneth Winter's somewhat ambiguous use of the term &quot;disconnect&quot; in 
     referring to his A/C prompted me to share something.
     
     Besides the alleged damage to the environment by releasing R-12 
     (Freon) into the air, disconnecting any portion of an A/C system and 
     leaving it that way, will allow moisture (corrosion potential) and 
     other contaminants (dirt clogging) to get into the system.  I 
     understand that it is difficult, costly, and sometimes impossible to 
     reverse these processes once they've started, so for your sake later 
     on or for the sake of that subsequent owner that you want to someday 
     get top dollar out of, don't remove anything and leave the system 
     open!
     
     Believe me, if it weren't for this, I'd have an easier time trying to 
     put together an A/C system for my two-door 411 project car.
     
     All that said, I'm pretty sure that Ken was talking about just 
     removing the drive belt, not disconnecting the compressor.  BTW Ken, 
     is it perhaps just the A/C clutch that needs replacing?
