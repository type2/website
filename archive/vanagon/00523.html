Subject: Fuel additive sinks &amp; FAQ anyone?

My '73 Westfalia is a bottom feeder. Fuel gauge was in the red and I added
one bottle of 'Valve Saver' before filling the tank. Then I drove 2 blocks
and thick white smoke came from the exhaust for a minute w/a total loss of 
power. I checked over the dist. carbs, coil, plugs, oil level - all OK.
Tried starting and idling and more billowing white smoke came out.  :(
I thought I had added brake fluid for a second and then the smoke cleared
and all returned back to normal.  &lt; w h e w &gt;  It *was* 'Valve Saver'.
The 'Valve Saver' must have sunk to the bottom of the tank and got sucked
in the fuel lines. The bus dosen't run very good on 'Valve Saver'.  ;-)

1. Am I wasting my money on 'Valve Saver' fuel additives?

2. Is there a FAQ for this mailing list? 
   (I don't care for the taste of my feet or wasting your bandwidth)

p.s.
Before I replaced the fuel gauge sending unit I learned the total capacity 
of the fuel tank (14 U.S. Gal.) by running it dry about 3 times a year.
