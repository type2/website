Subject: '89 Westy is growling!!  Help.

My '89 Westy has a growl that sounds like it is coming from the water 
pump.  At least I'm sure that it is coming from the left side of the 
engine.  It sounds like a cement mixer with some rocks in it.  What do 
you guys think?

If it is the water pump, new or rebuilt and how much do they cost?  I'm 
going to put it on myself (and learn how to bleed the cooling system).

Regards,
Bo
