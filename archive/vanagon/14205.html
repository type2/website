&gt;Stainless Steel Brakes Corp.  Doughnut Gas Tank, item # A2900 - $70,

Jezuz, who buys these things? I use a cheap red plastic jerry can, 1 gal. 
capacity. lies on its side inside the spare, held still with a short bungee 
cord. total cost maybe $8. Fill it full to keep from sloshing and screw the 
top on tightly.. JCWitless sold a 'spare tire' gas tank, to go in the tire 
well of your car trunk. Don't know the capacity,(or $$) could be 5+ gals. 
Just throw the spare inside/on the roof rack. tim s.
