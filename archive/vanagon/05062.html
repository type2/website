&gt; 	Hello everyone.  I just recently got my hands on a '64  
&gt; MicroBus.  I need an ignition coil and a starter.  I know it still  
&gt; has the stock 6V system, but I'm not sure of the engine size.  As far  
&gt; as I can remember, 1200 is stock.  It is possible, I guess, that it  
&gt; could be a 1600.  I don't know my VW's enough to tell by sight.   
&gt; Anyway..the block is #H0476361.  Can anyone tell me my engines size.   
&gt; I think that the Idiot guide has the codes, but mine's in the mail,  
&gt; don't have it here now.  Any help would really help me speed up the  
&gt; process of getting this thing to run.  Thanks in advance....later..

Well, since nobody appears to have answered yet (at least to the list)
I'll venture to guess that it's a 1500, based on info I received from
Eric Oster last week.  I have a friend with a 66, and his is *definately*
a 1500.  There should be a square tag on the fan housing on the left
side with engine specifications - I believe the 1500 produces 44 hp.
I'll have to look at that one in the junkyard again next weekend to be
sure.
