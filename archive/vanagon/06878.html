Subject:      vw magazines

gerry asked me to post the addresses/cost/and so forth of all the vw
magazines 'out there', but since i'm at &quot;work&quot; (hahahahahahaahha!) right
now, and since i don't really know everything, i thought it would be a
good topic to ask:

who knows of what magazines out there, specifically ones dedicated to vw's
(and buses if you know of one)?  i know there is a british magazines and one
in france as well, that you can receive from some folks in the states (EWA
i think is the one ... but the subscriptions are rather costly).

so:
HOT VWs and Dune Buggies
&lt;will get the info and address tonight&gt;

VW Trends
&lt;ditto on the info and address&gt;

now ... should we consider this Funkengrovin thing a 'magazine'? or is it a
sort of club newsletter?
