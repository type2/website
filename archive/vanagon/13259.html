 As I was riding my bicycle to work this morning (sunshine, at last!)I spotted
 a BRIGHT Red Vanagon Synchro Westy coming the opposite direction. This unit
 appeared to me to be a recent model with the moulded bumpers and all - every
 thing painted this fire engine red. The radiator grill, the lower one, was
 very small however - only about 10 inches high by 20 inches wide. This was
 especially puzzling to me because only a couple weeks ago, I saw a white
 Syncro Westy with german plates under the California ones that had a radiator
 grill that ran the full width between the turn signals and had fog/driving
 lights built into it. Are these different grills aftermarket items? Were there
 more model variations on Synchros because they were built at Steyr Daimler 
 Puch? Both treatments looked more attractive to me than the standard Vanagon
 grill &lt;but then there's no accounting for taste&gt;.
 
 I'd love to have a Synchro but the cost of ownership is beyond my means &lt;sigh&gt;.


 Dave
