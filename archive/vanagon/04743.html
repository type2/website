&gt;I live in a similar neighborhood. Call it the neighborhood of fine

&gt;put small diameter superwide wheels on your shitbox.  The trick is they
&gt;have to be offset totally out of the wheel wells to clear the brakes.
&gt;This treatment really adds a touch of class to any nissan sentra !

i got you ALLLLL beat:  1994 Chevy Suburban, limo tint, neon license plate,
12-inch offset wheels with teenie-tiny tires. brand new, no less. now ...
