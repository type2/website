   Tim,
         This may not be a joke! There are several car co. that
         did not find ABS all that it was worth! Some of the 
         better designed cars found that wheel lock on dry roads
         to be a very small problem!

&gt; C'mon Harry, 92% of us KNOW that you can't lock the brakes anyway, it's a
&gt; vanagon design feature isn't it?  Or is it those cardboard brakes shoes I
&gt; got for $3.99 at Crappy Tire?  :)   tim smith
