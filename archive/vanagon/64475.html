When we bought our 1983 Vanagon, we told the dealer to leave the
shipping wax on the underside of the vehicle.  This is usually stripped
off after the vehicle arrives at the dealer.  We then oil sprayed the
bottom every two years or so.  After 14 years of the salt-laden southern
Ontario roads, I still own a 99% rust free van.  Most of the shipping
wax is still in place, and pliable, except for the wheel wells.
