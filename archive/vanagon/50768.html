 Also, someone mentioned a blown head gasket would cause water hoses to 
 break due to increased pressure. Why? I've notice no decrease in performance

 or watery exhaust, though I have the common Vanagon water leak from the
 cyclinder heads that I've temporarily stopped up with AlumaSeal.
 
 All responses appreciated. Thanks!

It seems that somthing is over pressurizing the system to cause repeated hose
failures.  A swollen expansion tank is another cause of concern.  Something
is wrong.  Also check cooling fan operation and have a leakdown test
performed on the engine.  It is possible to have combustion gases enter the
cooling system without a noticeable los of coolant or performance.
