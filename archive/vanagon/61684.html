Subject: Eurovan Winnibago VR6 at June Jitter Bug Show

Anyone with an interest in the new Eurovan Winnibago/Westy, that is
within driving distance of Niagara Falls Canada may want to attend the
June Jitter Bug show on June 22 1997.  I was at the cruise night tonight
(Sat. June 21/97) and what should show up, but a VR6 Eurovan Winnibago
version of the VW Westphallia.  This vehicle will be at the show
tomorrow.  It is on loan from Volkswagen Canada, and is a stretched
Eurovan with Winnibago's version of the Westy.  Very interesting.  It
apparently is not available yet, but it certainly was there in the flesh
for everyone to look at.  It will be set up at the show.

Too bad it wasn't a TDI 5 like they have in Europe.
