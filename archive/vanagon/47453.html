Subject: How To Get Footwell Air Outlets To Close Completely?

     I am having trouble getting my floor air distribution vents to close 
     completely. (I do have the third ventilation control lever slid all 
     the way over to the right).
     
     This is not a problem during the spring and summer, but in the winter, 
     before the engine warms up, outside air seeps through the vents, 
     causing a pretty uncomfortable Fahrvenugen.
     
     The local dealer did some adjustments, which didn't seem to help, and 
     the next step (in their opinion) would be to start replacing parts 
     (translation: we really don't know how/want to fix this). Frankly, I'm 
     not too comfortable having an engine mechanic work on non-engine 
     things anyway, and the lever slides easily, doesn't make any unusual 
     noises, nor does anything unusual that might indicate replacing parts 
     is necessary.
     
     Anyone have any thoughts/ideas/suggestions?
     
     Thanks,
