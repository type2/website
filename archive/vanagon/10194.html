&gt;Alright sage types!
&gt;The dirty deed must be done, and I need the wisdom of those who have bravely
&gt;gone there before me. The patient is a 78 Westy who is exhibiting a slight
&gt;list to the drivers side. The van is lower at the rear, with it being just

Gettin' a little heavy, eh?

&gt;a tad lower on the rear drivers side. I shall be performing surgery within
&gt;the next week or so, and would muchly appreciate the home-mechanics-cut to

Surgery?   Do it yerself liposuction?

&gt;the chase-surefire easy way of doing this. I've read the manuals and have a
&gt;good idea of the procedure. I wanna know if it's as basic as it looks.

There isn't an easy way to do this, but take a moment right now and 
thank your personal god(s) that you don't have reduction boxes!  
Its not extremely difficult (like timing a carrera 4-cam engine,) and just 
takes patience

Your'ge gonna wanna have this thing on a stable surface, first off.
And remember, this is a potentially dangerous operation you're gettiing
involved in!  I shattered a thumb doing this exact same thing to my 911 -
and I've done a few before!

Anyway, you should not have too much trouble getting things back together,
as long as you clean up the bits as you go along, so you aren't threadin thru
dirt, etc.  

Its also a good idea to put in new bushings at this time, if yours are looking
ragged.

Be prepared to do the whole operation a couple  of times, since its a bit of
guesswork to get the proper angle.
