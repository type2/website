Subject: A '59 bus found

Dear All,


  I was driving to the dentist with my dad on saturday, when we
drove past what i could see as being a '62 or earlier bus parked 
up on someones very overgrown garden. Well i could not help stopping
and having a closer look and we discovered that it was a very sorry
looking '59 but it was a stange conversion, i think it was originally
a panel van but someone had added the three windows down each side.
You could tell that they had been added because they were not flush
with the sides of the van. It had the original as far as i could tell
34hp engine, door trims etc. but the roof was nearly rotted through
and it would require a new one, there was no interior at all.
I liked the rear lights (small circular ones) and somebody had added
dodgy looking indicators to the back, how do these rear lights work?
are they brake, indicators and rear lights all in one?
Well besides the roof the rest was not too bad, and while we where 
snooping around an old lady came out to see what we where doing, she
told us that her son was taking it away and was going to restore it.
She also said that she often gets people taking a look at it, and
could not understand why. She said if we were interested then leave
our name and number and her son might contact us if he decides it's
too big a job.
Well i was interested even though we have still not completed our '62
resto. I think i would convert it back to a panel van though, i don't
know if the conversion was carried out by a proper company or done by
a PO. It was quite a nice find, you don`t see many about on the roads
or in junk yards here. I always read on the list about people finding 
old buses on farms and in barns and i am always envious of a good find.

Cheers,
