Really disappointing news you brought Tom,

500 requests and orders on on day and nothin happend - seems like afmiliar VW 
behaviour to me. 

What is the rest of the story ? At the moment I am a little upset about the 
mag (which is partly supported by VW AG) presenting more than one year old 
stuff for beeing latest news.

Please give me details how things went on last year. I am quite sure these 
pictures will initiate a discussion and wants for such a car as well over here 
and it would be a shame if there is a &quot;just kiddin&quot; from VW one day.

Sorry, couldn't find anything related to Concept 2 there - but a  lot of nice 
bus pics which cooled my temper down a bit ...


Bye for now, Tom N.
