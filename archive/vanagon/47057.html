 My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is a
 noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the dash.
 I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of the heater
 controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in mid
 summer.
 
 Is this a common problem? What's the diagnosis and what's the fix?
 
 Many thanks in advance, &gt;&gt;
Assuming the heater contrls are working, you probably need the heat
insulation kit.  A lot of heat transfers into the passenger compartment from
the radiator.
