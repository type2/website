&gt; Also,
&gt; every once in a while (quarterly, I think) they have a special pickup
&gt; at the post office here.  They sit in a parking lot for a day and take
&gt; hazardous waste for free from people.  Maybe your city officials would
&gt; know of something similar in your area?

Wonder what they do with it at the post office? I guess they probably mail it to
Canada... :&gt;'
