Subject: Re: Coolant Temp Indications

    hi Jim and Drew !
 i don't doubt what you said Drew, but i've had the same gauge problem in my
rabbit and i'm sure mine is completely electrical (i.e., NO overheating)
because at the same time the temp gauge shows hot the fuel gauge goes up as
well. never thought it serious enough to fix it, figured it's mebbe a loose
ground connection in the instrument panel ???
    cool on,

Jim, &gt;  &gt; &gt; My coolant temperature indicators are intermittently screwed up.
&gt;
&gt;  &lt;snipped some more symptoms described&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Your symptoms sound like what I was experiencing when there was a
&gt; small leak in the coolant system.
&gt;
&gt; When there is a small leak, air can get into the coolant system.
&gt; The air in the system can cause the temp gauge to read high.
&gt;
&gt; My leak was where one of the rubber coolant hoses is held on by
&gt; the orginal &quot;spring pressure&quot; hose clamps. I replaced the clamp
&gt; with the &quot;screw&quot; type hose clamp, bled the system, and the problem
&gt; never appeared again.
