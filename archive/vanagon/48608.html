Subject: Re: Trakkar Eurovans

&gt;     Has anyone ever seen one of these in person?  I came across them on
&gt;     the Web and requested their info.  They are really neat looking.
&gt;     Their stove in the Eurovan swings out so that you can cook outside!
&gt;     They even offer one with all of the camping equipment located UNDER
&gt;     the rear bench on ball bearings that allow it to slide out for outdoor
&gt;     camping.  But one of the really great features is that they offer
&gt;     solar cell panels for the roof to run your appliances in the middle of
&gt;     know where.
&gt;
&gt;     Does anyone have any experience with them?  They say they have been
&gt;     converting vehicles into campers since 1973.  Why can't they be
&gt;     imported into the U.S.  I'm first in line if they ever do.

Hi Scott,

Trakka is an Australian company and they have been doing 'up market'
conversions on a number of vehicles since the early 70s (not just
VWs)...They're main competitior in the VW was 'Sunliner' who did (think
they're out of business now?) a cheaper more traditional westie like
conversion on breadloaf vans.....

The process of trying to get a Trakka Eurovan into the US is probably too
difficult and costy for most - basically I imagine a US model would have to
be shipped to Australia, converted then imported to the US - it would cost
a fortune (the Trakka conversion is not cheap in the first place).....

The most logical thing would be for some enterprising soul to set up a
Trakka 'franchise' here in the US and build 'em.........
