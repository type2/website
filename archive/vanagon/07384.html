&gt; You wanna know something,
&gt; There is really no logical connection that I can think of ... but after
&gt; I bled the clutch slave, my vanagon sure did steer much more easily.  It
&gt; always seemd so difficult before.  But, that's probably a brake fluid
&gt; induced idea ... :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;Is this a common problem or what? Or am I really getting too old? My 83 westy's

I bonked my '89 Westy over Thanksgiving and my steering went instantly
to EXTREMELY heavy. I haven't fixed it yet.

(The story goes like this: I'm on the Pennsylvania Turnpike at mile marker
6, which is in the Appalachians near Pittsburgh. Sudden snowfall. We get an
inch of snow in an hour. No salt trucks are out yet. The guy on the radio
doesn't believe it is snowing. We are crawling along at 30 mph. A gust of
wind hits the van obliquely and I steer into it, starting a progessively
ugly slide. I tap the guardrail, causing a slight burn mark on my bumper,
and spin around and stop. Facing the wrong way, stopped, in the left lane,
I watch the person behind me hit me head-on at 15mph. No injuries. I ate
his driver's side quarter panel and lights. He cracked my grille and bumper
and my steering stopped working so nicely.)
