Subject: heater duct repair questions
Date: Wed, 27 Dec 1995 10:08:38 -0800 (PST)

hey there all!!!

well last night i got down and dirty with the underside of the bus
again, looked around in amazement (oh, that's where that cable goes),
for the main purposes of unwrapping and checking the heater ducts.  lots of holes,
but all in all not as bad as i thought.  came up with a few questions,
and figured i'd ask away.  

those accordion looking black plastic parts that attach the heat
exchangers to the &quot;Y&quot;.  what are the paper parts inside for?  filter
of some sort?  in one of them, it is falling apart.  thinking about
replacing with insulated dryer flexible hose?  

the ducting, except for one major area at the front junction, is ok.
a few holes here and there, but not to much rust.  more like the PO
had cut into the pipe in a couple of spots, and changed his mind
halfway through and wrapped it in duct tape.  the place where the
long tube meets the front junction box(?), there is another flap on
the inside here, is completely gone.  it was covered in an old bleach
bottle and duct tape.  my question is assuming i can clean up the
little bits of rust, and figure a decent type of patch for the front
junction, should i just repair the old one and wrap it in insulation,
or is ripping it out and wiring up some pipe and tubing from a
hardware store an easy option that is worth the trouble?  how hard is
it to remove the existing metal duct that is (seems to be) welded to
the underside of the frame.  

the good news is there is very little rust down there:)  Oregon and
south carolina don't salt their roads!!! :)  i did get to grease some
parts while i had things out of the way, and adjusted the emergency
break cable.  a little at a time, and maybe one day ....

thanks everyone, for this and all the past advice.  take care!
