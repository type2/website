Attention wannabussers,

On the way home from work today I saw a '79 bus for sale in a parking lot in Opelika, AL  Checked it out and here are the specs.

'79 Transporter 
Clean interior with no visable rips in seats.
Body has a few dings on the rear and passenger side but not to bad....mostly minor.
Very little rust...big surprise..just a little on drivers door.
73000 miles....one owner
Engine still has factory fuel injection.  Pretty clean in engine compartment.
Owner asking $2900.00 (I think a little high, but......)
Phone (334) 749-6970

&lt;insert usual disclaimer here&gt;

wannabussers......GO GET 'EM!
