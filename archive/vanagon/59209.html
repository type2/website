Subject: Re: 84 westie runs hot in slow traffic

Sam,

My 84 was doing the same thing.  I noticed that my fan wasn't coming on
except when it was really hot.  I recently pulled my radiator and had it
rodded and cleaned.  Lots of junk from Barsleak.  I changed the fan switch
which is located at the lower left of the radiator.  About $15 at local
supplier.  You can test your fan (or make an override switch for that matter)
by making a small jumper wire to go between the hot wire going into the
switch and the other two wires.  One will make the fan run at low speed and
the other will make it run at high speed.  Hope this helps.

&gt;My 84 westie runs hot in the summer in slow traffic.  This makes me 
&gt;really anxious, with summer comming on.  Also if I have to climb a long 
&gt;mountain in a low gear it happens.
&gt;If I turn the heat on it helps, but this is not a good answer.  
&gt;Additionally: It is the gauge that goes up the overheat light doesn't 
&gt;come on.

&gt;Is there a way to add a manual override on the radiator fan?
&gt;Once the fan kicks on things get better?
