Subject: 911!-Call for Assistance

        OK, so Im supposed to leave this coming saturday for Tofino, BC, so
I sent the Mystery Machine (my 83's name) to the shop just for one problem
that I could not diagnose. The problem was that my fuel mileage had gone
horribly screwy after a short trip to the Hinton area one weekend. Mileage
was ok getting there but coming home it was atroctious, as I posted in a
previous message.
        So anyhow I called over to the shop and they've gone over the beast
with a fine brush comb, all to no avail. Everything 'should' be alright.
Henry, the mechanic, a 25 year vet of VW's is at a loss. The problem they
see is that the fuwel mixture should be at around 1.5 (1.5 whats I dont
know, this is all greek to me), and my mixture was at 9, and they cannot
get it any lower than 8.5. They've checked alot of different things trying
to find a solution, but havent found one yet.
        I have 4 days till the trip of my life starts and the means to get
there is up in the air. Pplease help.

sniff sniff pout,
