Subject: storing CV boots

I have some CV boots (already mounted to axles with CV joints) that I won't
be using for a while (several years maybe). What's the best way to preserve
the rubber on the boots? Talc? Silicone lubricant? Vaseline? I plan to seal
them as best I can in an airtight wrapping. Any problem storing them
outside in a tool shed where temperatures will vary (but not that much,
this is Seattle).

TIA,
Mark McCulley
