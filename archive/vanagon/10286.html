&gt; Subject: Gas Gauge on 78 bus
&gt; 
&gt; My gas gauge is out on my 78' bus. 2 liter engine, 7 passenger. I know
&gt; the gauge in the dash is fine, and I was told it was probably the float
&gt; in the tank. I was also told the only way to get to the float was to
&gt; remove the engine, transmission, gas tank, etc.. I was wondering if it
&gt; was possible to nibble out a hole from the rear floor/riser behind
etc....etc....

Hi Marc,
I replaced the sending unit in my '76 camper bulli a little while ago. 
Fortunately the hole in the floor plate was already cut by some previous 
owner. I own the original VW Repair Manual for Type 2's, in which I found 
a nice drawing incl. dimensions where to cut the hole and how to do it.
If you email me your mailing adress, I would make copies and send them to 
you.
The replacement of the sending unit is quite simple.
