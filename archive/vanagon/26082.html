hi, all

there's a graphic on the new &quot;Sharan&quot; at the following location:

http://www.vw-audi.co.at

it sort of looks mainstream, with F-O-R-D written all over it
(well, I guess it was a VW-Ford collaboration), with touches
of Honda Oddity tossed in (it's shown w/ a 4-door + hatch setup).
It's too bad they didn't go w/ the dual sliding rear doors ala 
Chrysler, but, oh well....

On the up side, I hear it's supposed to be available w/ the VR6  :-)

ps-sstones would have a field day w/ this site!  it's in German.
