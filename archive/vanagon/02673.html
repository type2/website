Subject: List Must Mass VW On A/C

The following appears in the latest issue of VW/Autoist. It is of vital
importance to all Vanagon owners with Air Conditioning:

&quot;As you are aware, freon is being phased out of production and will not be
available in the near future.

&quot;Therefore, automobie manufacturers, including Volkswagen, are contemmplating
making conversion kits available for older cars so that their air
conditioning systems can use the replacement for freon, HFC-134a.

&quot;Please encourage all VWCA members to contact VWUS Customer Service at
800-822-8987 and express their desire to see a kit offered for their
particular model.

&quot;For example, VW is currently deciding whether to make a kit available for
the Vanagon, so this is a case where your vote definitely counts.&quot;

The above from David Magulness, 31 Twinshore Court, Carmel, IN 46033.

Now, the obvious thing to do is to overwhelm VW with calls from people on
this list who have Vanagons with A/C. Everybody should print this file out
with the phone number and carry the paper around and then call the next time
they have a chance. 

Everybody should also probably send in a letter. Here is the suggested text
of a letter to send. I suggest you copy this text onto a piece of paper, fill
in the blanks, and send it off. It is your duty to your future. In a couple
of short years, you will be frying in your own juices if you don't. :)

Dear Sirs,

I understand you are now considering whether to off a kit to retrofit the
Vanagon air conditioning system so that it will take the new kind of freon. I
am writing to urge you to do so. I would definitely be interested. I have a
(year) Vanagon (camper, syncro, diesel, whatever).

                                           Sincerely,
