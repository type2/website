Subject: Air Filter Desperately Needed

hey now,

been hunting and looking and searching for this damn filter that costs about
$1.25 or so. my FLAPS used to carry them but say their supplier has been for
a couple of months. i have a '74 bus with a single weber carb...the filter i'm
looking for is a disposable one, fits right on the carb and then you clamp the
top down. it's retangular. i THINK it's stock number 7001...anyone know what
i'm talking about? anyone know where i can get these...i would glady send $$
if your local FLAPS has them. i've been all over raleigh, nc and the local
VW ripoff dealer doesn't even carry them. regualr parts stores are no help.
i shoulda stockpiled on these but didn'f for some reason.

thanks for any help!

jonathan
