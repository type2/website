Subject: Re: 80 vanagon heat duct

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;        I have a quick question for some of the air-cooled experts out
&gt;there. I am missing the heat ducting elbow that extends from the heater
&gt;blower down thru the sheet metal fitting into the right heat exchanger.
&gt;This is an 80 Vanagon bye the bye.  Don't ask me how i lost it, but
&gt;my question is can I drive without it?  I have called every dealer in
&gt;the area and I leave tommorrow (24 hours) on a trip to Wyomming.  Without
&gt;this piece I have noticed that the right heat exchanger gets much hotter
&gt;than the left one, seemingly since no cooler air is blowing thru it.  I
&gt;realize of course that i am sacrificing some of my van's heating
&gt;capabilities without this piece, i think i can deal with that, I want to
&gt;know if i am possibly hurting anything else?
&gt;
&gt;        I would greatly appreciate any help and advice any of you could
&gt;give me.  Happy Holidays.

My '71 Bus was driven for quite some time with those hoses--they kept
breaking on the previous owner...I just ordered new paper hoses from The
Bus Stop, but I've never had any problems...

Good luck and happy huntin--I mean happy holidays!
