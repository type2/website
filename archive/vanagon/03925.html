&gt; 
&gt; I researched awnings and selected the A&amp;E Transawn 3000 in 10 foot length
&gt; with optional Vanagon rain gutter mounts. I can almost put this thing up and
&gt; down with one hand it is so easy and I would not change my purchase decision.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I also bought the optional screen room with safari panels for privacy for
&gt; this awning so I can make an extra room off the side of the camper--sort of
&gt; like a tent. I have never set up the screen room yet though.

Derek,

Can you email me more details on this?  Manufacture's address, phone.  If you
happen to still have a flyer on it, maybe you could fax it me?

Thanks for the info.
