Subject: '74 Westy - strange sound, rear wheel?

I'm throwing this out to the list 'cause I don't know where to go with it,
and Muir doesn't appear to address this particular situation.

Last night jumped into the van to head home - there is a loud, consistent
&quot;clunk&quot; from the left rear of the van.  Seems to be related to the speed of
rotation of the wheel, ie: I speed up, the click/clunk speeds up. On quick
inspection nothing seems amiss, but as it's storming out there (and I have no
dry work space), I didn't really get under there for an up-close.  Before I
put on the rain gear and go wallowing, can anyone suggest where to start?
 What can I provide to aid diagnosis? I really don't want to drive it 'till I
have a clue what this noise may be!

Ruthie
