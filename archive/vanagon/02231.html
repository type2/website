Well, for my bus I was using 92 octane because it would diesel and back 
fire on the cheaper gas.  I tried adjusting everything, but it never 
worked.  But high octane fixed it.  I also noticed that I got about 2 MPG 
more, but that coul be contributed to me feathering the gas to prevent 
backfires from cheap gas.
