Subject: coolant distribution unit

I ordered a coolant distribution unit for my 87 syncro to have as a spare in
my bag of tricks for the road. This is a plastic piece with four hose
connections that sends coolant to the radiator and aux heat exchanger. It
sits to the front of the passenger side head. The part I received (251 121
442) has an extra opening that is not a hose connection. I think there must
be a removeable plug that goes in there to allow coolant to be drained. I've
talked to two dealers, including the dealer that sold me the part, Camelback
VW, and they can't find this plug on their computers. Have any of you syncro
owners replaced this part before? Did the new part include a plug or
something for this &quot;extra&quot; hole?
