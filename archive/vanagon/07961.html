Subject:       Re: Low oil Pressure?

 &gt;My oil pressure light and  buzzer has begun coming on above 2000 
 
 #1.  Put a guage on the oil pressure sender port and check out your 
oil pressure directly.  Do it, just do it.  If you don't want to 
fiddle with removing tin (and exhaust studs) take/tow it to a dealer 
to do it.  It will buy you more peace of mind (and possible save an 
engine) than a lobotomy.  Gerry will drop you from the list if you 
don't have this crucial step done ;-}

#2.  I don't know if those 87 foot models (sorry, you'll just have to 
live with this!) have the DYNAMIC OIL PRESSURE WARNING/MELTDOWN 
 (TM) feature as my 86' Jetta (you people awake?) did but I got into 
all sorts of buzzers/flashing LEDs when I had problems with this 
wonderful NORAD system.  The Jettas had a tech bulliten on this 
problem, maybe it applied to all VWs after a certain year.  (Joel, 
this is your cue)  I ended up putting in an oil pressure gauge (and 
volts and a vaccuum gauge, jeez I'm such a geek) in my 86 just for 
peace of mind.  The tech fix was to replace the oil pressure system 
computer circuit (attached to dashboard)  Sorry I don't have the 
bulletin, I threw them out when I sold the Jetta (bought new, nothing 
but problems, traded for the '85 van, more problems... I'm SOOOOO 
slow).

#3.  Do nothing a continue to drive, this is where Vanna will give 
the Big Wheel a final spin and remember, we've added an extra 
Bankrupt place on the wheel....
