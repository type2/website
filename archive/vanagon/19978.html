&gt; What's the difference in ENGINES between a TYPE I and TYPE II. They look 
&gt; pretty much the same to me, but it looks like, from the ads saying &quot;put
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any price difference in TYPE I and TYPE II longblocks? If so, why?

There are some differences.  But lets just eliminate most of the esoteric 
differences by limiting the discussion to post 1971.  

The only type of 1600 engine you want to use in a bus is an AE case.  This 
case has larger oil galleries and a pair of oil pressure relief systems.

Now for the differences;  the bus engine has extra castings at the back 
of the engine (oil pump um end) for mounting to the bus rear crossmember 
engine mount.  However there is a universal case that will fit any thing 
because one just ignores any useless extra parts.  If you have a really 
good &quot;bug&quot; case and you just have to use it in a bus, you can do so by 
buying a special oil pump cover that adds the needed mounting brackets.  
This jeryrig works, but requires regular removal to replace the leaking 
oil pump gasket.  Although I did use one for about 10 years with no 
problems until it just started painting the road with oil.  

This disscusion is only valid for the 1600 cases.  In 1972 the bus got 
the really different 1700 psuedo porshe engine.

You can stick just about any engine in a bus but you might need to rig up 
the sheet metal cowling to completely seal the engine so that the cooling air goes the 
correct way.
