&gt; &gt; Can I get by replacing the front 2 for the time being and do the rear tires

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do I have to have the exact same tread wear on all 4 or do they just need to
&gt; &gt; be the same size.

&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt;      I have a VW training manual that says &quot;When the difference in
&gt; speeds between the flange shaft and the pinion shaft is less than 6% the
&gt; viscosity of the silicon fluid is low. This allows the plates to slip,
&gt; resulting in no transfer of power between them. However, when the speed
&gt; difference between the two shafts beccomes greater than 6%, which could
&gt; happen if the rear wheels lost traction on a slippery road surface, the
&gt; outer splined plates connected to the flange shaft begin to cut or shear
&gt; the silicon fluid. The shearing action of the silicon fluid causes
&gt; internal heat and results in a sharp increase of the fluid's viscosity.
&gt; It becomes more difficult for the fluid to become sheared and the
&gt; coupling locks up.&quot;  I suppose you knew how the viscous coupling worked
&gt; but I was interested in what VW said about the 6% difference in speed. I
&gt; wonder if the coupling will not lock up with the two shafts spinning at
&gt; a 6% difference for a long distance?  I wouldn't want to try it. I think
&gt; you should get the tires matched as closely as possible. The front diff
&gt; is very expensive.

How much in tire diameter could 6% represent?
