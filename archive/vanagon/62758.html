Subject: 81 fuel pump

Yesturday I stopped to help a fellow vanagoner stranded at a red light
near where I live in Wilmington De. Engine turned but would not start.
Checked and found spark. Swapped cap and rotor, still no start. Pulled
tube coming from fuel pump and had him turn over engine, fuel gushed
out. Was towed to his local shop (by AAA) and they notified him today
that problem is with fuel pump and total cost = $410.00  Can anyone
advise as to whether this is likely or possibly a misdiagnosis since I
checked pump by removing tube. Also he mentioned that he is original
owner and has been thinking he might sell it since he and his wife no
longer go camping. The bus has less than 40 THOUSAND MILES on it. Thanks
for your help.
