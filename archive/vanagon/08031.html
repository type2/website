Subject: seats

David Kao raves:

&gt;You must be kidding! How could they be so cheap? Are you sure they are
&gt;in good shape? Do you feel anything wrong when sitting on them? Where did you
&gt;get them? Is the owner of the junkyard a friend to you? Are they real vanagon
&gt;seats? They are probably after maket used seats, you know?

I got real lucky at Austin VeeDub, Austin, Texas.
