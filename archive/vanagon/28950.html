Subject: Re: Route 66

&gt;If/when this show ever does get on the road, I have dreams of driving most
&gt;of Route 66 from Springfield to SoCal. Time permitting, of course, which it
&gt;might not. Doggone, Thanksgiving would be the PERFECT time for the trip,
&gt;but family responsibilities may preclude that.
        Can't see anything that'd make me more Thankful than another bus...
Might try that on the family...  ;-)

Peace,
