Subject: Wanted: One crank out window

I am looking for one Westfalia crank out side window, as used in the '65-ish Westys, it is aluminum, with a screen and 4 glass panes, 3 of which crank out. Glass unimportant, but condition of screen and window frame must be excellent (oxidised aluminum is fine... but no painted or otherwise changes windows please). I already have five for my Kombi, need one more to completely eliminate the pesky pop-outs! Thanks for your help, please respond via email, as I am temporarily not subscribed to list. Email me at:
