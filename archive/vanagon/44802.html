After the 2 week deadline and after the unreturned calls you (Jim Ellis)
should've been on to this idiot.  I can empathize with you but, by the time
you felt the need to leave snide messages for him, it was time to get your
parts back and find another painter.  How good a paint job could he do that
would be worth all this hassle?   Go elsewhere with your money.

Ellis agrees and says:
Your point is well taken. 
It was discussed with the painter that he was getting the job because of the
other jerk painter's lack of follow-up. I also had been trying to chill and
give the guy a *little* slack. As I mentioned, every message which I left
was professional and provided appropriate phone numbers. The only part of my
last message was to use the word &quot;freakin&quot; &lt;and not the close cousin&gt; as it
described my unreturned phone calls. I also am busy with other aspects of
life which prevent me from baby sitting. Like earning a living and
concentrating on my profession. But, yeah, I agree with your point. The
trick is to find a &quot;good&quot; professional in whatever specialty or craft that
will accomplish what task that you have before you at the moment (and lack
the expertise and time/health/resources/etc.) to do it yourself. 
Contingents of the list might now all jump up and suggest that situations
like this is the reason that they do &quot;everything&quot; themselves. I recognize
that it may be possible, but not realistic, for all of us to do everything
outside of metalurgy and petroleum engineering just to maintain a vehicle.
Occasionally it should be less than sheer Hell to count on and do business
with a &quot;professional&quot; specialist in their craft to accomplish any given (and
accepted) task. Living in the world where everyone wants to pass the buck
and cut corners and not pay attn. to their responsibilites creates more
folks with &quot;chips on their shoulders&quot; and fewer nice people. I refuse to be
forced into the role of a victim without a fight. Some people that I have
encountered tend to want to push you in that direction and get indignant
when you fight back. I say &quot;tough darts&quot; to that action.&quot;
Enough of my soapbox and back to my work.
~end of thread. I'm over it.
