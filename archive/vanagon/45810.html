&gt; - In the last two days my 84' vanagon has been having starting
&gt; problems, I changed the spark plug wires to new Bocsh ones this
&gt; weekend.  It's also been pretty hot in the bay area. Before, it
&gt; started every time just fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Anyway, the symptoms are : 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Starts just fine first thing in the morning, runs fine once 
&gt;    started. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. After the first start of the day, it turns over but does not 
&gt;    catch. There's a strong smell of gas.

- Thanks to some hints I got emailed I found the problem. The
connector to the heat sensor for the fuel injection was loose.
