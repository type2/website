&gt;What did you seal your heater boxes with, if I may ask. I found an old
&gt;pair of boxes at a junkyard for a 78' bus, one is in perfect shape, the
&gt;other has the outer sheet metal shell rusted out in little rings about
&gt;1/4&quot; wide around the pipes coming in from the exaust manifold. I was
&gt;thinking maybe high temp silicone gasket, but didn't know if 700 degree
&gt;max temp rating was good enough, any other suggestions on sealing these
&gt;up?

I seal them by brazing with zn oxy-acetylene torch (not too hot, though!)
and nickle-silver rods.  These rods are pricey, but they have a lower
operating temp, so you don't destroy what's left of the heater box shell.
