Dino, I tried to e-mail you directly but the messsage will not go through
with the address you have in your post.  I own an '87 Westy and do all my
own repairs and know of good part sources in the area.  I have a heated
garage and if I can be of assistance or if you just want to chat give me a
call while your in town.  I'm a short 45 minutes west from downtown via
the queensway.  I work nearby during the day so try to reach me after 6 pm.

Cheers

Frank
