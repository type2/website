&gt; I think this is because of the apparent slack in the steering wheel.  I can
&gt; turn the wheel a couple inches in both directions without any perceptable
&gt; change in direction.  What I think happens is, as the car starts to leave 
&gt; the center of the lane, I turn to compensate, but not enough fast enough 
&gt; and then I have to crank it hard to get back in my lane.  I would think
&gt; tightening up the stearing would solve a bit of the problem.  

My bus has that much play in the steering too, but it tracks pretty
straight.  I bet you have an alignment problem.  Also, are your tires
all the same kind?  Inflated to the same pressure?  If the rears are
a different make, try swapping front and rear tires and see if that
has any effect.  Might give you a lead on what the problem is...
