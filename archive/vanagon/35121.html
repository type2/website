Subject:  i'm stoked! (+ an 81 vanagon question)

my brother just got back from a trip to austria and brought me a
transporter emblem ($15 at a dealership)!  i'm going to replace my
weatherworn vanagon emblem with it.   he got one for his 88 too. 
haven't seen it yet, hope it fits.

questions: i'll be receiving a rebuilt motor (30,000 miles ago) for
my 81 in a few weeks, and be faced with my first engine
removal/installation.  the motor currently in the vehicle is the california
model, and i'll be replacing it with the non-ca model.  1) what are the
differences (i'm familiar with some), which might cause complications,
and  2) any suggestions as to what should i check out/do to the 'new'
motor before installation, while it is easy to get at, in addition to replacing
front seal, checking crakshaft endplay (which i still haven't quite got a
grasp on)?  i would like to do the job correctly, and spare myself future
hassle by being thorough.  i am not afraid to learn, so any wisdom
sharing would be appreciated.

thanks from matthew and mobius the 81 adventurewagen
