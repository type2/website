So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; ok. calmly now. we have to set a goal for next year. in 1995, we have to
&gt; get ALLLLLL the buses in america on this list!!! Today, Internet! Tomorrow,
&gt; The World!!!

I'm not sure I'd want ALL of the bus owners on this list.  Hell, it's hard
enough to get through it if you don't read it for a weekend or so.  Like
when your stupid hardware at work goes down on you and you can't respond
to a great weekend of vanagon list posts. :(

&gt; well,ok. maybe that's a bit ambitious. how bout: Today, Tuscaloosa! Tomorrow,
&gt; Amarillo?? ;)

Let's try Manteca first!  ;)

&gt; there is a nagging thought in the back of my head about all this. do you guys
&gt; (and gals) realize that there is a Muir-like book in all this??  If everybody
&gt; 'published' what the problem was, what they did to fix it, etc., and we put
&gt; all that stuff together ... well, not to blaspheme or anything, but Muir was
&gt; just one guy, with a few chickens and goats for help. lookit how many buses
&gt; we've got to work with. admittedly, we're gonna have some disagreement ...
&gt; but then, not Everybody agrees with what Muir or even Bentley says.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, it's just a thought right now. lemme know what you think.

Okay Joel, you get the goats and I'll bring the chickens... ;P

Anyway, I thought that the FAQ list and the growing WWW/gopher stuff was turning
into the Next Generation Idiot Guide already.  Not to mention this list.

Just think.  The online Idiot Guide for newer VWs of the 80's and 90's.

By the year 2000 will be starting the virtual reality idiot guide where we
are actually shown how to fix any part of are VW's.  Wow! Cool!  Ric could
literally show me how to undercoat the pan.

Martha could display her flannel wardrobe.

Joel could walk us through a virtual library of VW goodies and  showing 
us how to prepare grits in the highest Alabama fashion.

And they said the future was dead.  Not as long as there are VWs around.
