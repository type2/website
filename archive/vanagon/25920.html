Subject: Re: heating ideas: insulation!

Just a quick note for those contemplating another cold winter in the Vanagon.

Spent Sun pm. 5 hrs. insulating the walls+sliding door of my '87. How much 
insulation was there before I started, NONE, not one bit. A rubber sound 
deading pad? 4&quot;x10&quot;x1/8&quot; in sliding door, NOTHING else, no wonder I was 
colder last winter than in the old panel I had fitted out. It took about 24 
feet of 15&quot;x3.5&quot; fiberglass pink insulation, R12 rated. You can buy 
'handyman' rolls of the stuff in that length, or a big bundle containing 
about 80'. It took a 40' roll of double sided carpet tape 1.5&quot; wide, and 16' 
of heavy polyfilm 32&quot; wide. Total cost &lt;$25.00 plus the 4 hours re/re the 
wall panels/seats.  Liberally sprayed the body cavities (not my own thank 
you) with 'RustCheck', about 1/2 tin. The carpet tape is great, holds poly 
film tight while you replace the panels. Put it on before you spray, and 
wipe the surfaces clean also. Do this at home kids, well worth it when we 
get to -40C/F, probably help the A/C too. Van was quieter going to work this 
am, maybe warmer? not cold here yet.

Rust report: snow/salt-slush leakage at rear of middle (sliding) window had 
somehow gotten into body, rusting one of the inside of the seams. There is 
no real undercoating on the interior surface, NONE. There is also no paint! 
just that thin black primer you get on the body panels you buy. My old panel 
was fully painted there!!!
        There was a faint but widespread show of tiny rust spots, due to 
condensation droplets. Most noticeable up inside window frames etc. I 
thoroughly sprayed those areas, but couldn't insulate easily. Insulation 
ends at window sills. Floor seams where door 'plate' joins bodypan are 
lifting from rust intrusion, visible from below, outside. Some floor bulges 
where pan sits on longitudinal runners. These appear to be the weak 
rustprone areas to watch and treat on vanagons, along with the outside 
seams. No rust above rear wheels/firewall region, nor in rockers ahead of 
rear wheels.
         My '85 panel was bare to the walls when rustchecked inside and out 
at age 1. It didn't have any of the above rust showing, inside or out 9 
years later, except for the usual seams. I'm not happy. The '87 has seen 
lots of bad winters, so this is indicative of worst case damage, and really 
ain't too bad at all. Most of my breadloaves were rustthroughs by this age! 

Now to do the rear hatch, roof/headliner is too much work. Except for the 
front, I'm done, time to get some wooly carpet and electric socks. BTW, 
electric innersoles for ski boots are available, battery powered. Go gettem 
folks, wire them to 12volts and really cook. Just don't forget to unplug 
them before stepping out of the van.  :^)    Tim S.
