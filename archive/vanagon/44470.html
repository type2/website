Subject: Bugosity

Greetings...

During recent postings, there has been talk of intermittent 
missfiring at various speeds.  There was some indication that this 
was something referred to &quot;Bugosity&quot; so my question is, what is it 
exactly and how is it diagnosed?  What are the corrective measures?
I've checked the archives, but have not been able to come up with the 
infor I'm looking fore.

Thanks in advance,
