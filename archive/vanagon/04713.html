&gt; &gt; Drums have bolts in em,  Disks have studs for Nuts. (the vans also have 
&gt; &gt; seats for nuts  :)   )
&gt; 
&gt; Are you trying to tell me I have disk brakes in the back?
&gt; Gee, that would be nice &lt;grin&gt;.   You sure you don't have that backward?  


	Well, I confess I'm less-than qualified to discuss this being a 
	sleazoid ex-camper-owner, but my memory recalls all (4) wheels
	on my '91 used bolts; no nuts.

	My sense is that one of the contributors to European cars (them
	fern things) having the rep. they do with Detroit-iron types is
	precisely stuff like bolts versus nuts. When Bubba the tire clown
	changes wheels all day, life is normal until someone brings in one
	of them fricken fern things. Then Bubba vents anger because Bubba's
	skillset doesn't work.

	Bubba
