Subject: Re: /F How not to do restorations

I once had a 66 Chevy, reved it up to be cool and actually made the timing
chain jump a tooth. When the truck quit and wouldn't start back up, I got
out, slammed the door, and both headlights fell out of their sockets. Later
that night, I went out to the truck and stepped on a baby
copperhead--barefoot. After not getting bit, I went to bed and hid under
the covers for a while.

VW content: If I was driving a bus, none of this would have happened. 8)

&gt;now, supposedly there was this fellow from Anniston, AL who blew a fuse in
&gt;his pickup truck, and lost his headlights. well, sir, he didn't have no
&gt;fuses in the glove box, but he did have his .22 rifle in the rack behind the
&gt;seat. :)  so he gets a .22 Long Rifle cartridge from the rifle and puts it
&gt;into the fusebox. presto! he's got headlights again.
&gt;
&gt;only problem is ... see, fuses get kinda hot. so did the cartridge.
&gt;BANG! the fusebox shot him in his foot. :)
&gt;
&gt;if you knew anything about the folks who grew up in Anniston, you'd find that
&gt;story very very easy to believe. :)
