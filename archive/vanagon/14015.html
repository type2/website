Subject: RE: 6v wipers on 12v bus

&gt;&gt;To: Multiple recipients of list
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Granted, the transistor would have to dissipate 60 W, but so would any power
&gt;&gt;resistor that could be used for this application, but the fact that the
&gt;&gt;transistor controls the voltage at 6V to the wiper motor (or more if you wanted
&gt;&gt;the motor to run a little faster), means that the motor won't bog down under
&gt;&gt;any condition (like when it is pushing aside wet snow).  There are many
&gt;&gt;transistors that can easily handle these requirements as long as they are
&gt;&gt;sufficiently heat sunk (as in mounted to the chassis), the main problem is that
&gt;&gt;the case has to be isolated, so a mica or sil-therm insulator must be used
&gt;&gt;along with shoulder washers when mounting the unit.
&gt;&gt;

Believe me, it will be very hot for any transistor used in such 12V-6V
converter (actually regulator). It could burn your fingers if you touch it.
It is not going to be reliable.

A real converter can be built at around $10 - $20 without producing much
heat. The circuit is a little more complicated but works well.

First it needs an oscilator to drive a power transistor which turns on
and off the 12V at 50% duty cycle. The output is now an AC of 6V (rms).
Add a 50 uf 15v capacitor in parallel to the 6V wiper motor and connect
it to the 6V AC. The duty cycle of the oscilator can be adjusted so that
the motor actually gets an equivalent 6V DC.

The reason the transistor will not be so hot is that when it is switched
to on it passes all voltage through and consumes no power. When it is switched
off there is no current through it and consumes no power either. It does 
eats some power during transition between on and off but it is very minimum.
