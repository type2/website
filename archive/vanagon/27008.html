Subject:       People in a hurry, serious story.

Yesterday, a friend of mine told me that that morning on I96 near 
detroit he watched a large flat box fall off the top of a van. The 
car in the next lane hit it dead center and sprayed glass everywhere. 
 Musta been a window or a table top. The kicker is that the car never 
stopped.  If some one is in that much of a hurry, you know they must 
be a chronic tailgater.  Hopefully that cured some of her problems.
