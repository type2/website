I
I was commuting between Pennsylvania and Vermont every week in my 72 
automatic Squareback and I was cruising with the traffic at 75 and 80 
miles per hour...... Gee I miss that car



 
&gt; &gt; I have been driving 50 miles a day commuting with my vanagon for a year.
&gt; &gt; That is too much a waste for vanagon miles. Maybe it's time to get a Jetta?
&gt; 
&gt; I drove 120 miles a day commuting in a vanagon for four months.  I then got
&gt; a rabbit convertible, a rabbit truck and a GTI.  I have not gotten around
&gt; to getting a jetta yet.  My brother-in-law bought a 95 jetta last month but 
&gt; I have not &quot;borrowed&quot; it yet.  Maybe at the next autocross. ;-)
