Subject:       Re: VAnagon-Bad Lifter


&gt; been driving my '83 GTI. Unfotunately now when I start it (after a 2 week rest)
&gt; a lifter is making noise. This happened once before but after a few minutes
&gt; it went away.
&gt; This time it is not going away. Is there a way I can detrmine with some 
&gt; certainty exactly which lifter is bad. 
&gt; Also, does anybody have any experiences replacing lifters in a Waterboxer.
&gt; 
Hi there.  I don't think this is a serious problem.  My '90 wakes up 
like this once in a while.  VW says not ro worry about it. I usually 
let it warm up slowly, and take it out for a 20 min drive on the 
freeway, and it clears itself up.  I haven't owned a VW with
hydraulic lifters that doesn't do this.. even my '87 Golf diesel will 
do this once in a while, and my mother-in-law's Golf (gas), and my 
neighbours Jetta, and my friends '88 Westy, and .......

I haven't had any problems in doing this, and my diesel has over 
170000 km on it, and my mother-in-laws old rabbit lasted 13 years 
with no problems, etc, etc.  

How long have you run the van with it still doing this?  I have found 
that just idling the engine won't clear it up.  I semi-retire the van 
over the winter, and it'll do this once in a while.

Hope this helps.

Harry.
