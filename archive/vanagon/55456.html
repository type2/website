&gt; One of the chaces involves the pursuit of a stolen Army tank wreaking havoc in a
&gt; residential area somewhere in SoCal. The driver is intentionally running over
&gt; vehicles and anything in his path.
&gt; One shot from a Police chopper zooms in on a dark grey metallic Vanagon (the
&gt; color that was widely used on the '87-'88 wolfsburg ed.) that is right in the
&gt; tanks path......
&gt; SQUASH!!!!
&gt; It actually pushes the Vanagon backwards for a bit until it hits a RV, then
&gt; squashes the Vanagon, as well as the RV behind it.
&gt; 
&gt; They later show a closeup of the Van after it was squashed. The drivers side and
&gt; the roof were crushed to the ground, and a little of the passengers side
&gt; remained.
&gt; 
&gt; ouch...

Chris,
I thought I was the only person that noticed stuff like tanks eating
Volkswagons.  Its good to know that someone else notices every
Volkswagon Vanogan that passes their view.  My girl friend thinks its
odd, but I enjoy it.
