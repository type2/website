So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; Ok, I admit I was stupid even thinking of selling the EV...and even stupider 
&gt; posting it here, but I was at least a source of entertainment for those who 
&gt; replied to my posting on Friday night...so it wasn't all a total loss!  ;-)

I think you're mistaken about it being mid-life-crises.  I was comparing
it more to insanity which is what I'm currently going through about this
'65 pick-up I'm sittin' on the fence over.  :[ 

&gt; were:		used Audi 90C
&gt; 		Golf Cabriolet
&gt; 		Mazda Miata
&gt; 		Subaru Imprezza
&gt; 		Plymouth Neon (over my strongest objections)
&gt; 		Jeep Wrangler (ditto)
&gt; 		Passat

Well, considering your wifes current driving record (no offense intended),
the only options on the above list are the Jeep and the Audi with the Passat
as the only close second because it's a VW.  The others are just too small.

&gt; has always been very simple...VW/Audi/BMW/Mercedes period.

These four get my vote, especially the Mercedes.  Your wife can only do
so much defensive driving ya know.

&gt; Saturday morning arived, and she had a change of heart. The EV stays...we'll 
&gt; go looking for a new car. We drove the Subaru first...then most of the cars 
&gt; on the list. At the end she said, she loved the Subaru at &quot;first drive&quot;, but 
&gt; didn't say anything...she wanted to &quot;torture&quot; me by going to look at other 
&gt; cars.

Doh!! 

Well, you could've done worse.  (And you call yourself a lawyer, you pliant
fool..)  ;)  Well, I still say the Mercedes would've been your best bet, but
you've already made your emotional decision so you'll have to live with
it.  I hope I can still make mine.  Maybe it's too late.  Oh well...

I knew you were up to no good Ric!  :)  ;)  :)
