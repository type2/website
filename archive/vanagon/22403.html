Subject: Naptha=FI Cleaner?
Date: Wed, 9 Aug 95 21:49:27 EDT

I ran some concentrated FI cleaner through a tank of gas. The engine stumbled
repeatedly; but smoothed out after the next tank of gas and may have even run
better (but its all subjective, right?). I WAS able to make it from
Toronto to Ottawa at an almost constant 70mph, something I haven't tried
before in the Westy.

Anyway one of the main and in fact only significant ingredients was
naptha. My question is, can I now run small amounts of Coleman fuel in my
Vanagon as an FI cleaner? Its a heck of lot cheaper and it IS a very clean
fuel. What side effects can be expected?


TIA
