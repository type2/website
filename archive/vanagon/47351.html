If you can reap the benefits of repairing the RV then do it.
I assume that either way, you're going to end up with a Deluxe.
Do a cost tradeoff selling as is versus repaired, and go with 
whichever ends up with more money in your pocket.
Just a guess that you will be better off fixing it first than selling it.
FWTW.
Jeff
