Subject: more on new bus.

thanks joel and sami for the help.  this is what i was able to find out 
today.

the bus is all original and has only 53,000 original miles.  the small 
1x1' board is for the small table that goes in between the driver/s and 
passenger seat.  the other board (1x3') is for a front plate on the jump 
seat.  the padded seat thing is the jump seat base.  

i drove the bus all day today and was pleased.  it cruzzed at 65 and 
still had more if i needed it.  the shifting was fine.  still stalls when 
cold.  i will be getting a manuel.

i got the original factory manuels (pamflets) today.  they were send by 
the PO.  it turns out that i am missing the jump seat base and one of the 
cousions.  also the pole for the front table.  anyone have a source for 
those? 

i am still causiious about getting into the motor.  looks nothing like my 
other 40 hp motors.  oh well, i guess i will learn.


thanks again for the help and God Bless
matt



ps.  joel, yes i now have 3 bus's.  i am looking to add more also.
