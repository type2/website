&gt;&gt;Still don't know whats wrong, but I'm guessing the injectors are clogged.
&gt;&gt;Remove plug wires,
&gt;&gt;manifolds, spark plugs.
&gt;.
&gt;.
&gt;.
&gt;&gt;Call around about cleaning, or rebuilding injectors, can't find anybody who
&gt;&gt;does it.
&gt;&gt;Strongly considering slapping the stock carb on and seeing how it runs, and
&gt;&gt;how the power brakes behave.  When I get some time.
&gt;.
&gt;.
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;Err, how much you say you paid for that gas, sound expensive, does he sell 
&gt;much???  I've bought bad gas, unfortunately several times in upstate NY, 
&gt;just over the Cdn border from us. It wiped out my '85 van really well, 
&gt;hesitation on the highway, some bucking, and then a steady drop in power 
&gt;with tons of misfiring. I seriously didn't think we would finish the trip. 
&gt;Took a long time to clear out at home, I was topping up with Cdn gas as 
&gt;often as possible. Try disconnecting your fuel pump intake line and put it 
&gt;into a jerrycan of gas you know is good. Water is injected into the 
&gt;cylinders to control pre-ignition pinging in over-turbo'd cars, wipes out 
&gt;regular engines real well. Chevron Techron gas treatment gets good reviews, 
&gt;try that also maybe.   tim s.

&gt;

I wish that were true, however, I noticed the performance failing before I
pulled into that station.  I also have realized that I simply did not filter
the fuel ring properly.  I used a circa 1971 type III pre-pump filter
without a high pressure filter post-pump, pre-injectors.  I also had to
remove the low pressure filter I had installed on the return line back to
the pump from the ring because it leaked.  This could easily have allowed
contamination from the tank to enter the pump since it's on the same line.
Fooey.
