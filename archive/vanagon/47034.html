Subject: Re: brakes again

&gt;   I am wondering if anyone can tell from this description if it is air in
&gt; the lines or do I need a master cylinder. I asked yesterday and some people
&gt; were good enough to reply with suggestions. From the advice that I got it
&gt; could be the master cylinder, the booster, or just air in the lines. I
&gt; would like to replace the master cylinder before bleeding if it is suspect.
&gt; Although, if this sounds like a classic case of air in the lines that would
&gt; save me a bunch of dollars. I don't have a clue so any info would be
&gt; greatly appreciated. Should I just replace the master cylinder and bleed?
&gt; or just bleed? I suppose that the master cylinder wouldn't be that much $
&gt; but I suspect that the booster will be tons of cash ( I hope its not
&gt; that!). Thanks again.
Cost of bleeding brakes- Nothing (except for about 1/2 hour)
Cost of replacing Master Cylinder- probably at least $100.00
I would Highly recommend bleeding the lines before looking any farther...
