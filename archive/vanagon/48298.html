     HI ALL,

       Reminder:

       This sunday evening (Aug. 18th) is the VW car show at Sandcastle, 
       (the water park on the mon. river) here in Pittsburgh PA. 
       All People in the area  should Plain to show your Vanagon 
       for a while at the show. Most of these shows are very informal
       so bring what you got...

       Could someone forward this to the type II list, I can't
       seem to get the address right!
