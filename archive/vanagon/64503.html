&gt;&lt;&lt;  spent about an hour on a 84 in a yard yesterday with a scary front

&gt;
&gt;Although I love our 1976, and adore the 1986 Westy, I have to admit, I do
&gt;worry about the front end &quot;crumple-ability&quot; of our vehicles. Neither Suzy nor
&gt;I tailgate, and we are defensive drivers, but I have always figured that a
&gt;hard front end hit would cost us at least our feet, at most....
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have experience to ease my mind? What happened/how'd you fair? I
&gt;would also be interested in VW crash safety test results, but don't know
&gt;where to look. Also, has anyone crashed a bus with the optional spare tire
&gt;mounted up front? I'd be interested in your findings.
&gt;
&gt;I know this is an ugly subject that we'd rather not think about, but if it is
&gt;an inherant liability of this design, so be it, I can deal with it. If there
&gt;are bunches of you who have slammed into the back of a semi- at 60 mph and
&gt;lived to giggle, lemme know.

There is some crash test information and some photos at
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ in the 'info' section.
