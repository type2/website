Subject: chairs at redrock


I suggest each person bring something like a lightweight (perhaps)
folding aluminum-lawn-type chair for sitting at Red Rock.  There
seems to be this tendency (like there was a Big Sur) for group
campers to want to gather round the fire, and it's nice to have the chairs
for this!
