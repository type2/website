Subject: 6v wipers on 12v bus



Well, I purchased at great expense ($17!!) for a device that converts 12v
to 6v and looks suspicously like a resistor with a heat sink.  

Hooked it up to my wiper motor expecting great results, but the result
I got was quite underwhelming.  The wipers moved, but veeeeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyy
ssssssllllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyy.

Things that could be wrong:

1)  Wiper motor is actually a 12v unit  (I can't tell, no readable info;
                                         I had assumed original tho)
2)  Gummed up from sitting around for years   (should I try opening the
					       unit and cleaning/lubing?)
3)  Wiper mechanism somehow screwed

4)  ??????

Any hits/insight appreciated,
...Markus
