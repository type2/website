&gt; Hi, I'm looking for a chrome rear bumper for my '78 Westy. Any tips and 
&gt; leads appreciated.  If you have one, I will share some of my insurance 
&gt; windfall with you (if it ever arrives!).  I was rear ended and was blown 
&gt; away to find out that the chrome bumpers are a limited edition deal for 
&gt; '78s only (is this really true?), making them out of sight new and not 
&gt; available (apparently?) after-market. 

Ask Dyer Lytle.  I saw a picture of his 73 camper and he has a chrome
bumper on it....
