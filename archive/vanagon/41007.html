---snip---
&gt;I UPSed the old cores to Busboys 
&gt;and never recieved my $100 core deposit back.  I wrote and called busboys 
&gt;and was basically blown off.  UPS claims to have delivered the core.  
---snip---
&gt;the service sucked, not to mention the fact that they still owe me $100.

 Isn't this mail fraud? Communication with the U.S. Post Office should help!
