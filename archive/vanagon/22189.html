Subject: Re: solenoid and pinion gear

  so today on my lunch break i went out and tried to figure a few things
  out about my '73 bus.  earlier i had posted that the clicking noise
  you hear when you turn the ignition key to the first notch (this is
  caused by the solenoid pushing the starter/pinion gear into the
  flywheel, right?????  if not what is it?) does not go away after you
  start the motor...

This may sound like a silly question, but do you have an electric fuel pump
on your Bus?  A mechanical pump won't make any noise while it's working, but
an electric is noisy as hell.  I have a new electric on my '73 (to replace my
questionable old electric) and have not had one single problem with it -
except for the noise!  It makes a repeated tapping sound continuously, like
lightly rapping a hammer on metal.  At any rate, crawl under your Bus &amp; poke
around in front of the rear wheels and a bit towards the center.  Look around
on the frame - you may see a small brass or silver-colored box with two fuel
hoses, one on each end.  That's your fuel pump (if you DO happen to have an
electric one!) and possibly the cause of your noise!  

Hope this helps!
