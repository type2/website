Subject: Re: shift box for syncro

&gt;When my local 'ASE' certified mech. replaced my tranny on my 87 syncro, he 
&gt;had to replace a piece of the shift linkage in an attempt to get the shift 
&gt;pattern to work (reverse was way left, hitting my gas pedal knee and very 
&gt;hard to get into first).  The new piece of linkage helped some:  the pattern 
&gt;is tighter, but still way left and first is not quite as difficult to 
&gt;engage.  The mech. said the shift box also needs replaced.  Problem is he 


If you mean the tin box hung under the floor below the shifter, I can't see 
how it got fritzed.  It's well protected and only sees some slight sideloads 
from the base of the lever. There is a chunk of pot-metal that makes up the 
reverse drop-down lock, and controls how far sideways the shift lever goes. 
If the reverse lock is gone you may nick gears, that's all.  Try loosening 
the two bolts on the floor, just pull up the shift boot and use a 13mm 
wrench.  Pushing the adjuster plate to the right will get the shifter away 
from your knees when in reverse.  A newer adjuster plate is available, but 
you don't gain anything judging by the looks of it.   Did your mechanic get 
the splines on the shaft (that is under your bus) back together properly?  
It sounds like the splines are a couple of teeth out, which may explain some 
of your alignment probs. Took me 3 tries to get it together so that the 
stick is in the right position and reaches 1/2 and 3/4 gears OK. It is a 
careful balance to reach both gates easily, I still nick 2nd unless careful.
