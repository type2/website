Subject: RE: i wanna compile a list of reliable parts dealers



&gt;my experience with vw partsplace has left me steaming...and i want to do
&gt;something about it. has anyone ever compiled a list of the reliable mail 
order
&gt;vw parts dealers before? i realize mistakes will happen (he he i'm a
&gt;distribution support agent for ibm) but i keep hearing and hearing about
&gt;vw parts place.
&gt;
&gt;maybe folks can send me or post to the list about their experiences with
&gt;various mail order companies?


That would be handy, but, as the Penguin said, &quot;Things change&quot;.

May I suggest two slight mods?

1.) For bad experiences, relate only recent incidents, like in the
last six months. The guy who screwed up your parts order back when,
may have been fired for that and six other braindead moves, and now
his replacement is trained-in, willing, and efficient.

2.) Put a date (at least month/year) on your tale of woe, to facilitate
the above.

For Good-news stories, of course, no statute of limitations need apply!

For instance, I was looking for some manifolds for a pair of baby Kadron
carbs for a single-port (!) engine. Nobody had any, new or used. Finally
reached Bob at Johnny's Speed and Chrome, who broke some out of a kit.
We agreed on a price, and I put a money order in the mail that afternoon.
TWO DAYS LATER they arrived, complete with gaskets although he had pointed
out that, being kit refugees, they wouldn't have any.

Bob had to have shipped them even before my money order arrived--
probably same day as our phone conversation, though I didn't ask for that,
and he included extras. I can't imagine better service from anyone,
in any way. Kudos to Bob of Johnny's Speed and Chrome!

This took place in July, 1995.
