Subject: Re: gauges for a Vanagon

The oil filter I got for the '81 diesel Rabbit had a warning about VW engine
causing them to burst.  Unfortunately at the time I was at Fort McCoy, WI and
the closest towns, Sparta and Tomah, didn't have a VW dealership or a place
that sold Bosch or anything else for a VW Rabbit diesel.  When I got back to
West Saint Paul, MN that filter got replaced real quick!

&lt;&lt; Concerning the Oil Pressure gauges;
 
 0 - 80 # is used on all air cooled and waterboxer motors.
 0 - 150 # is for the &quot;Rabbit type&quot; motors as they run incredible oil
 pressure. Most people not familliar with them won't believe they run
 that high, but they do on startup.  Leads to a few unique concerns such
 as needing quality oil filters.
