Subject: TRANSMISSION QUESTION

I found a '70 van for $2000 (I'm sure I could talk him down to $1500).  
Anyway, he's done a lot of body work and gotten rid of most of the rust.  I 
couldn't do my full &quot;Muir&quot; checkup because of time constraints, but was made 
aware of a problem.  He said it slips out of second and will need a new 
trans.  How much do you expect that would be parts and labor?  It does have 
a new 1600cc engine that he paid $1500 for.  It only has a 100 miles on the 
new engine (scary?).  New brake pads and new master cylinder.  The interior 
will need some work.  New tires also.  Does this seem like more of a problem 
than it's worth considering it will be my first bus and while I am good with 
most projects, I am NOT a mechanic.  Advise???  P.S.  The only reason he is 
selling it is because he is moving up north and can't afford to get the 
trans fixed in time, plus he doesn't want to tow 750 miles.
