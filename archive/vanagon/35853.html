Subject: Re: Euro-Winnebago Complaint / vanagon HVAC question

&gt;is something I miss in my '85 Vanagon since it does not have an integrated
&gt;heating and cooling system. 

Could someone please explain the vanagon HVAC system, it seems to only have
fresh air intakes, no recirc, i duct-taped the intake vent in the winter and
it caused the fans to whine.
Recirc would be nice.
