&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do need to know how to get the middle seat out of this thing to finish 
&gt; &gt; cleaning up the carpet, I've given up trying to do it in the car, this is 
&gt; &gt; garden hose and dry in the sunshine work.  Previous owners were hauling 
&gt; &gt; well-behaved cattle.  The interior is very dirty but physically in very 
&gt; &gt; good shape.
&gt; 
&gt; You have to lift up the carpeting by removing the thin metal that runs 
&gt; along the floor by the door (three philips screws) and then the bench 
&gt; seat will slide out after removing the bolts that hold it into the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; 
	Uhhh...IF all you want to do is clean the carpet, removing the seat 
	is unnecessary! The carpet can be removed instead after removing
	the doorsill strip (as above).
