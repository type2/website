Subject: auto tranny opinions needed
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 09:25:26 -0500

To refresh your memory, I posted last week an inquiry about a price for a
used auto tranny out of an '84. Didn't receive any responses concerning
price, but I did get some good info. Thanks! Anyway, I would again like to
to ask if anyone has any ideas on what would be a fair price for a used '84
auto tranny in assumeably ok shape.

Also, any opinions on the auto tranny? Power? Mileage? Reliablility?

FYI, I'm thinking of buying an '83.5 waterboxer sunroof w/a bad auto
tranny.

Thanks!
