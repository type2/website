Subject: Fuel gauge wiring diagram

I've been trying to fix the fuel gauge on my 73 bus. The gauge itself is 
working fine. So is the voltage regulator on the back of the gauge. So, 
before going to all the bother of removing the sender, I'm trying to check 
the wiring. I only have a Haynes manual, which is fine for most jobs but is 
no help when it comes to wiring diagrams (they're in black and white for a 
start). The diagram shows one wire from the sender to the gauge, the gauge 
is grounded, so is the sender and the regulator doesn't even get a mention. 
So where does the power come from, Haynes, eh? Can anyone help me out and 
tell me how to trace the wires? BTW an access hatch has been cut in the rear 
deck to replace the sender at some point, so at least I won't have to remove 
the engine to get at it.
