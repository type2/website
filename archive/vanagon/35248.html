&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; with no trouble, but as soon as we started to leave to go home this 
&gt; noise started up.  I could hardly get it into gear and when I let the 
&gt; clutch out that growling noise crept up.  The manuals almost descibed it 
&gt; but not exactly (as always).  The noise goes away with the pedal 
&gt; depressed.  It is the loudest in first gear, a little quieter in 
&gt; second...  It can barely be heard in fourth.  What is this, and what can 
&gt; be done to fix it?  
&gt; 

G'day all

G'day Will and Angela

I'm no VW guru so I could be wrong, but I hav had this problem in other 
makes of car.

It sounds like the Gearbox &quot;layshaft&quot; bearings.

In a &quot;normal&quot; (read rear wheel drive/front engine) the input and output 
shafts are in line. There is a load of sliding gears and syncros on these 
shafts and they mesh with a gear (the laygear) off to one side.

In first gear the laygear (and hence layshaft) do a lot of work changing 
the ratio and hence the loud noise in first. As you change gears the 
Laygear/layshaft does less work and so gets quieter, and in top gear it 
does nothing and is almost silent.

The upshot of all this is it sounds like a gearbox rebuild. But dont take 
it as gospel, as I'm no expert in VW's.
