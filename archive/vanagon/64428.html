Subject:      starter repair problem (bushing)

Hi All,

Hope your week is off to a good start!

I spent most of Sunday trying to replace my starter -- a job I suspect
takes a mechanic about an hour to do.  My god those bolts were in there
tight.  It took a gallon of Liquid Wrench and everything I have to get
them out.

My current dilema has to do with the bushing that sits on the very tip of
the starter assembly and is the first part to enter into the engine.  The
old bushing won't come out.  It feels like it's been welded in there.  Are
there any special tools or a great trick to remove a part like that.

Thanks in advance!

Ivan ('85 Westi)
