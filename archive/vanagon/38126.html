Subject: Vanagon Side step

Hi Volks,
   I was wondering, is there a side step for a Vanagon like they have for
the Bubble window buses?   I've been racking my brain to remember if I've
ever seen one.  If they did, does anyone have one they would like to sell?
Thanks.  Talk to you tommorow (3/22) on the Undernet channel Volkswagen,
around 8pm est.

P.S.  Who sells good low cost Vanagon shocks?
