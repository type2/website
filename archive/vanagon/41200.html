&gt;I need to locate a replacement gasket for the fiberglass cap above the cabin

&gt;of the drain / fill plug on the Syncro trans.

&gt;

The Gaskets can be gotten from East Coast Joe's,  516-221-4083
The drain plug uses a 17mm wrench.  If you need the plug, it is tapered so
you need to get the original.
