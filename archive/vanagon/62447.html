&gt; What do you mean by &quot;randomly disengage&quot;? Does the clutch slip or is the
&gt; transmission popping out of gear?I can not remember ever hearing of a
&gt; pilot bearing failing( I am sure they do though).It sounds like the
&gt; clutch is not disengaging. Lie under the car while someone pushes on the
&gt; clutch pedal. Watch slave actuate the T/O bearing  arm. Is it rotating 
&gt; or is it rotating AND moving away from the slave cylinder? Could be a bad
&gt; bushing (long shot). Get a little more info and get back with us.

&gt; &gt; when the clutch decided to randomly disengage, usually during 3-2 shift
&gt; on a 15% uphill grade... I recalled that the pilot bearing had been done
&gt; twice 
&gt; &gt;by the PO and started pondering just what the heck it does, and why 
&gt; &gt;this $6 part could be causing all this annoyance. 
&gt; &gt;Anyway, the problem was worst after 1-2 hrs of hard driving it 
&gt; &gt;seemed, but we made it another 300+ kms home with little drama aside 
&gt; &gt;from a few missed &quot;speed&quot; shifts.
&gt; &gt;

Ok. I figured since the pilot bearing has been done twice that maybe 
it was a common weakness, but I guess not. Here's some more detail on 
what happens:

First noticed after pulling over, leaving engine on, in neutral to 
get out &amp; take a picture. Pressed clutch, but wouldn't go in any 
gear. Shut off engine, went in gear fine. Started engine in neutral, 
same problem going into gear when running again. Let it sit for 5-10 
minutes while crawling around, checking brake fluid, leaks, etc. No 
problems seen.

Started engine again, this time went in gear, but every 3rd or 4th 
shift would not go in gear. Matching rpms worked fine &amp; using clutch 
worked fine.

Next problem: After several more pullouts &amp; not able to get into 
gear, found that I could start engine with it in 1st &amp; clutch in, and 
it would lurch a few feet, then clutch would &quot;let go&quot; Reved engine, 
released clutch as normal and continued, although with some lurching 
on occasion, as clutch seemed to grab at random. 

Final problem: Stopping a light, sitting in 1st gear, clutch would 
grab without warning, sometimes enough to stall engine, sometimes 
not.

Two important notes: During this whole thing, clutch pedal action 
*felt* completely normal. Also, there was absolutely NO slipping, 
even climbing 15% grades at full throttle in 2nd or 3rd, with van 
well loaded (~5000 lbs over scales)

One thing I did think of at the time but never had the chance to try, 
was pumping the clutch to check for &quot;leakdown&quot; in one of the 
cylinders. 
The road conditions made this kind of test too dangerous (if you've 
driven the Duffy Lake road, you'll know what I mean... :)
Interestingly, the last ~150kms or so of driving, mainly highway, the 
problem did not recur.

ps: I will try the above test on TO arm &amp; return the results later 
tonight.

Thanks!
