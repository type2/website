&gt; They sound nice. Where and when did you get them and how much were they?
&gt; What vehicle do you have?
&gt; 

Ours is an `88 Westfalia.  We got the Bridgestones from Big 10 Tires
in Tallahassee.  I am told they were designed for the Toyota 1-ton
pickup (not the new T-100, but a heavy-duty version of the small
pickup).  They were about $80 each, which is about what we paid for
reinforced XZXs before.  They're really beefy (as the specs would
imply), but they're not too noisy, work pretty well in the wet,
and are the same size as the originals.
