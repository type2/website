Well, I get pulled over regularly, in spite of our Vanagon (80 box) having
no stickers, paintjobs or slogans (although a dolphin or two wouldn't hurt).
The bus is post-office orange (in Finland poastal cars are orange
VW-Tranporters, which is nice, I can park almost anywhere:-) with tinted
windows in the back. Looks kinda drugtrafficking suspicious to me, plus my
hair is on the longish side. Funny thing though, they NEVER ask to look in
the back (even at Customs between Finland and Sweden). Why? My sweet smile,
or what?
Odd, I say.
