Subject: Re:  Vodka as anti-freeze


&gt;&quot;I was thinking about pouring a little Stoli into the last liter of my
&gt;drinking water to keep my pump from freezing.....&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Ooooooo boy.  Once you guys start putting vodka in the drinking water,
&gt;it's only a matter of time before you REPLACE the drinking water with
&gt;vodka entirely.

Will I have to pump out the J&amp;B first?


&gt;I can just imagine how this is going to impact our camping trips. 
 Jeeeeeze!

Will anyone notice a difference?    :^)
