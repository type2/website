&lt;&lt; I have a GEX rebuilt engine also and I am wondering if the noise I am
 hearing is the Tappets as Douglas has discussed. The engine ticks
 occasionally when climbing. I was first told that it was the CV joints,
 but after close inspection the CV joints were found to be in good shape.
 I went for a second opinion and a well trusted shop said that they
 couldnt hear the ticking, it doesnt do it all the time, so he suggested
 that I use only 91 octane gas, previously I was using 85. SO I did this
 and the ticking has stopped for a month, then last week climbing a pass
 on the way to Steamboat the familiar tick returned.... ANy suggestions?
 And how much to replace the tappets? It is an 82 with hydraulic
lifters...... &gt;&gt;


Ticking that is load related is not caused by the lifters.  When the lifters
go bad, it is usually apparent after engine startup.  Load ticking is either
caused by knock, leaky exhaust or I think in your case, heads that are coming
loose after you get the engine very hot.  The ticking is caused by combustion
gases poping through the gap between the head and cylinder. If you can change
the tick by changing the load(throttle), this is a definate possibility.
