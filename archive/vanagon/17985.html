&gt;There was a bizarre ST-TNG episode on recently. It involved the Enterprise
&gt;coming across this race of seemingly mentally impaired collectors called
&gt;Paklets  (sp). Their words remind me of the VW crazed:
&gt;They greet the Enterprise crew with the words &quot;We look for things. Things to
&gt;make us go.&quot; When Geordi repairs their malfunctioning ship, they say &quot;You are
&gt;smart. You will help us go.&quot; Then they decide to kidnap Geordi to get the new
&gt;equipment and expertise they need. Watch out Joel:) and claim &quot;Then we will be
&gt;smart. We will have things to make us go!&quot;.

THERE IS NO ESCAPE.     RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.  DENIAL IS IRRELEVANT.
YOU WILL ALL BE ASSIMILATED.     WE ARE THE BUS.
