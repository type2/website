Tim and Others,

Thanks for your reply about Zambonis. I actually know what you're talking 
about because I have seen one at an ice rink I used to take my kids to.

There's not many ice rinks in Australia, but there are enough for us to 
have minor ice hockey comps at a local level, mainly in the capital cities, 
and some skaters who get to Olympic standard. Our mens relay team was a threat
to the bigger, colder nations at the last Olympics.
