Subject: Help me Id this carb

All,

I need to get a carb rebuild kit for my Bus. I have a 79 with a 2L engine, with
a Weber conversion.  I need to know what the designation for this carb is
so I can get the rebuild kit.  It is a progressive. It has an electric choke.
On one side it has numbers stamped into the barrels, on the front(fif) is
the number 27, and on the back barrel is the number 26. I thought Weber stamps
the designation into the side of the bowl, but appearently not this time.

Any and all help(soon please) will be appreciated.

Thanks,

David
74 Thing
79 Westy

P.S. The PO did the conversion, I'd know what was there if I did it.
