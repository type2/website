Subject: 87 syncro: bushings for front drive mount
Date: Sun, 19 May 1996 08:57:52 -0700

On my syncro there is about 1/8&quot; of play in the big donut shaped bushings 
that are part of the front drive mounting system. At first I thought the 
rubber had hardened and shrunk, but upon inspection the rubber is still 
pliable and seems to be in good shape. Is this play normal? Could someone 
out there with a syncro take a look and see ifyou have the same play in 
these bushings?
