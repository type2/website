Subject: LIST STICKERS ARE IN THE MAIL!!!

Howdy all.
After dealing with nasty weather, and printing difficulties, I finally got the
stickers last night, and dropped them in this morning's mail. I will have to
take the non-US urders to the post office tomorrow, but all the others went out
in the morning mail, so you should get them in the next few days...
Hope you like them, I think they turned out well.
  Anyway, to date, only about 300 of them have been sold, so there are PLENTY
more if you haven't ordered yet...
Thanks, and enjoy.
