Subject: Yes, I'm still alive.

To All: (and to a couple in particular :-)

Please excuse me if I have failed to respond to a message.  The reason I
missed your message was probably because the subject line referenced a thread
having to do with Political Correctness, something I'd put tagged for
automatic deletion since it was of no interest to me.

I have a wide range of interests in addition to Volkswagens and monitor lists
dealing with firearms, aviation, ham radio, emergency preparedness and
horology, among others. It is impossible for me to read every message
generated by the several lists I subscribe to.  For example, since I own only
older VW's and have limited experience with new ones, I automatically delete
about two-thirds of the Vanagon list traffic.  But be assured that a specific
request for help will always receive the consideration it deserves even if it
is no more than an admission of my limitations.

The reason you haven't seen much of me lately is because most of my posts are
not sent to the list but directly to the person asking a question.  If it is
a question that has come up before, I often take that as evidence of its
worth to the entire list and make the posting general, as in the case of your
questions.  Even so, if you scan back through the messages I think you'll see
that I post general messages fairly often, although most have nothing to do
with Grendel.
  
I'm happy you found the Grendel messages of interest but they were a special
case that you may have misunderstood.  The Vanagon list is not a magazine and
does not have serial columns.  

 As to my 'future adventures' I'm planning to join the Top of the World run
to Inuvik next summer and if things work out, may provide the list with
periodic posts about our progress, but such things are entirely voluntary.
  Indeed, if things work out I should be able to transmit posts from other
members of the tour, giving the list a variety of impressions and
observations about the trip to the Arctic.  

If you joined the list during the Grendel affair I can see where you might
have thought rescuing old buses from a fate worse than junkyards was a
regular feature, but the truth is I am just another subscriber to the list
with exactly the same status and responsibilites as yourself.  If you wander
off in the woods, do improbable things to an old bus and decide to write
about it, you too will gain instant fame and exactly as much money as I was
paid for writing about Grendel.  (Hint:  Don't give up your day job.)
    
I believe Joel's statistics are another special case.  You should direct your
question about them and his status to him or to Gerry.
