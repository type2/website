Yup - but note that it is not *only* the static idle that changes; you'll
notice changes to the whole 'spectrum' of idle behavior.  In particular I've
been noticing that the whole system is *very* sensitive to what the coolant
temp is: I think the coolant temp sensor (yes, the very same infamous one)
has a bigger effect on the idle than I'd have suspected; also (&amp; I'm not too
sure how to describe this, but...) the rate at which the idle drops from a
given running rpm seems to be stongly affected by this adjustment.  If the
adjustment screw has been tweeked too far CCW, your engine braking will
almost disappear...cooking along at 60 mph, take your foot off the throttle,
&amp; it will take a *long* time to slow down.

Apologies if I'm not making myself clear - just go ahead &amp; try what I
described, &amp; pretty soon it will all make sense.  Most importantly, MAKE
ONLY MINIMAL ADJUSTMENTS, &amp; clean the doggone thing before messing with the
adjustment.
