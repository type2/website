]actually ... they probably are an invisible waste of money. :) but The
]Theory is (as i understand it ... at least on other cars) that the stainless
]steel braided brake hose (which is really just the braided steel outside of
]the regular rubber hose) doesn't expand as much as just ordinary rubber
]brake hose. it seems that when you really really mash on the brakes, the
]rubber hose will expand and so some of the pressure is being wasted (on things
]other than braking).
]
]so the braided steel constricts the rubber hose, and directs more pressure to
]the brakes. maybe you NEED this extra braking if you have a porsche 6-cyl
]engine in the back! :)  but other than that, it would likely be just a 'toy'
]to brag about.  it supposedly makes a lot of difference on a 914, though.

They sure make a big difference on a motorcycle!  I would think with the
much longer brake lines of a cage...er...four-wheel vehicle they would make
an even GREATER difference.  I can't agree that they are a toy.
