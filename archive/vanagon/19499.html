To All:

When we encounter a poorly designed part, and the only replacement is
ridiculously expensive and probably no stronger than the original, we should
organize a small group to obtain one good part, make a mold to produce a wax
casting, the use the lost-wax process to produce a hundred or so out of
vanadium steel by investment casting, passing the cast-but-unfinished part
along to other van owners for whatever it takes to cover out of pocket
expenses.

Making this idea work is no more difficult than producing knoves in wholesale
lots (and also works for false teeth).
