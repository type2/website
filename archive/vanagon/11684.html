&gt;I called Jet-Hot coatings, and they told me that they derust and repair any
&gt;small holes in your &quot;piece,&quot; and ceramic coat it inside and out.  It is a
&gt;baked-on metallic-ceramic coating that is very resistant to corrosion,
&gt;heat, and vibration.

Thanks for asking, Wolf. If you, or anyone else for that matter, get a
price quote, please let me know.

TIA,

Sami
