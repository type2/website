&gt;&gt; My SO needed a car toady (BMW Belly Up Again) so I lent her the 911!  I
&gt;&gt; wouldn't have even _thought_ to let her use the bus.  Is this proof I'm going
&gt;&gt; insane?

I must be going insane too.  My boyfriend asked to borrow my Camper to go to
Yosemite with his cousin, and I had to think about 10 minutes about it.  I
said yes, but I'll be nervous until they return.

My baby!
