&gt;&gt; Folks,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Since someone else brought up the subject (even though it was 
&gt;&gt; originally on the newsgroup), I thought I'd add my question/
&gt;&gt; comment on the subject of door handles.  I found it annoying
&gt;&gt; when I got my bus that the side door cannot (apparently) be
&gt;&gt; unlocked without the key.
&gt; 
&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; My problem now is that _I_ can't open the door from the
&gt;&gt; inside, with or without a key.  Anyone have an idea how
&gt;&gt; easy it might be to get a replacement door handle?
&gt;&gt; ..and while I'm at it, how easy is it to replace the
&gt;&gt; window crank (on the front door)?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I appreciate any help/advice/comments....
&gt;
&gt;Well, if it makes you feel any better, mine will not unlock from
&gt;the inside either.  Even though it seems to have a little lever there
&gt;for it.  Taking that inner handle/latch assembly apart has been on my
&gt;long-term list of things to do for a while now.  
&gt;


I've fiddled with this little lever and can't figure out what it's for.
It doesn't seem to do anything. Does anyone know what it's for?
