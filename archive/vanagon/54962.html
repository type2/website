Subject: Alloy Wheels ? 

well it looks like monday i will be picking up my first vanagon. (1980)

in my garage i have a set of alloy wheels off of an audi gt coupe,1986
vintage, 108mmx4 bolt pattern. I seem to recall reading that these might
fit a vgon. is that true? If not, what should i look for at the
pick-a-part yards in addition to vanagon wheels.

thanks a lot,
stephen white

ps: is this :&lt;) a smiley with a mustache or a frowny with a double chin?
