Hello-

I've been to Vanagon_dot_com and read the info on adding an extra battery to my
83.5 Westfalia. Thanks for that. But I have a few questions.

My auto electric guy was a little leary about adding a battery. He said the
alternator's life would be dramatically shortened by having to charge an
additional battery. Especially if that battery is often completely
discharged. He also said the deep cycle wheel chair batteries were way
expensive and heavy and I should go with a boat battery.

Electricity isn't my strong suit. So I only know the basics myself. Is this
alternator concern warrented? And does a wheel chair battery have advantages
over a boat battery?

Also I glanced at wheelchair batteries at Sears which seemed to be about $60
ot $70. That doesn't seem so pricey to me. Are these my best bet? Or does
anyone have good experiences with another brand to recommend?

Oh I should mention. My electric guy said I should have a separate battery to
camp then put it on a trickle charge when I get home. This seems a little
excessive. And what if I never come home?

TIA
Jeff
