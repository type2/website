I've got a couple of major projects pending, and I need to be able to
quickly check my mail box for the next few weeks.....

So, I'll be unsubscribing soon. I've enjoyed ALL the great company and
suggestions. And, since I still own two bay window busses, I&quot;ll be back,
no doubt.

If you need to reach me, try.

Robb_at_scsc.shasta.cc_dot_ca_dot_us

or (916) 225-4945 (work)

Thanks again.
