&gt;&gt;dinners (corn, hamburger meat, carrots).  Does it get hot enough in the
&gt;&gt;engine compartment of a bus, on the top of the block, to do this?  Anybody
&gt;&gt;know, or tried it?
&gt;
My engine compartment stays pretty cool, glad the rubber sealing is
still in good shape. However, my rear bumper seems red glowing hot
after I stop and check on the engine. Maybe it's my non-OEM muffler
that sits right underneath.
So no bumper-stickers on my bumper. Frying up some eggs would be
no problem at all. What I'm concerned now is that the new suspension
fork of my bicycle will be fried when I take it out West. Remember
when I told you about my home-made bike rack that bolts the fork
to the bumper? Jens.
