Yes, I have replacement chrome bumpers for $149 (plus ACTUAL shipping cost;
others charge an extra $15 &quot;handling fee&quot; on bumpers in addition to their
already-padded shipping charge).  The rear bumpers are comparable in
quality to the $400 O.E.M. bumpers, except that they lack the holes for the
impact strip (you'd have to drill holes or simply not use the strip).  The
front bumpers have the impact stip holes.
