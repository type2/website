Subject: Vanagon Prices

With all of the talk of reasonable and unreasonable van prices.  I just
talked to the owner of small independent garage in Montpelier VT who has
started selling used vanagons.  He has a '90 syncro Westphalia with 66k
for $16,000.  He also has two or three other vans for sale and I will
get the specs/prices etc. if anyone wants.  I'd post his 800 number, but
I'm not sure if there is a policy about ~commercial advertising on the
list. ???
