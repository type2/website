If you are unfortunate enough to have an un-spiral bound Idiot book I 
offer this solution.  I thought about the hacksaw, drilling three 
holes bit but it scared me.  So, I went down to Kinko's (insert name 
of local copying place here) and they did the deed and bound it up 
with one of those plastic things for $2.  There are a couple of dozen 
slots down the side so the pages will stay in there much better than a
three ring binder.  It hurt a little but I figured a hacked but much 
more functional book was better than a nice one that didn't lay flat. 
Also, I did the same to my Haynes.  For another buck they put a nice 
heavy clear vinyl cover front and back.  Enjoy.  Jim
