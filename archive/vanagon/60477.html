Peter,

Of cause not, this can be easily fixed by shortening the shift rod.
There is a clamp just behind the fuel tank. Loose it and shorten the
rod, but don't turn them against each other.

I tried a 112hp doublecab pickup today, the gearshift felt very strange
in 2nd and 4th gear the shift knob touched the dashbord, reverse gear-
stick was almost in the ignition key.... matter of adjustment or normal
to those vanagons??
