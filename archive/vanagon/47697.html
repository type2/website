Hi all

&gt;options should be considered for this transplant.  The AUDI A6 salvage 
&gt;yard donors are few, but among their number, the 6 speed manual box will 
&gt;be common.  How about keeping it all together?  I think its 214 ft.- lb. 
&gt;1900 rpm torque peak could easily pull the tall gearing when just rolling 
&gt;along.

Sounds great, if you're willing to make / weld up all the supports to get
that in there. Just make sure those 6 speeds are in the right direction,
i.e. forward :-)

&gt;  Also, if someone is remarketing original Audi/VW bell housings with ID 
&gt;numbers removed to create a micro monoply so they can increase 
&gt;their profits, that's OK.  But unmasking those OEM parts origin is also a 
&gt;fair end-user group research project.

Are you saying you need the part # of the bellhousing that fits between the
Audi 5 cyl engine and the stock 4 speed VW box? Shouldn't be too hard to
obtain, for me anyways...
