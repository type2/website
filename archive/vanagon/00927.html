Subject: Idle stabilizer testing

Folks,

I've been checking out the idle stabilizer because of no cold start
high idle.  At lunch today I quickly tested the valve using the
procedure described in the Bentley book.  .  I hear no 
buzzing and can feel no vibration from the valve.  The electrical
continuity of the valve is OK, but I can't find the control unit.
The wiring harness seems to go through the fire wall on the left side
to somewhere forward, NOT to the front of the right rear tail light 
area as Bentley says.  I've got the air intake duct there.  
OH, it's an 1987 model.

So, should I really be able to hear and feel the unit operate?  Anyone
know where the idle stabilizer control unit is mounted?  In my case
this look like the defective part, is this common?

Thanks,

DickE
