Subject: RE: Odd syncro


&gt;Now my syncro sleeps four + cats and dogs and goes anywhere slowly but this 

&gt;syncro...GTI motor, quite small, nicely colored with two doors and a 
snowbored
&gt;rack on top...said syncro on the back.  So ye of great knowledge and broad
&gt;travels here's the question.  What was it?  I know, do you?
