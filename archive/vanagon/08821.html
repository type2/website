So Dave Phillips says:
&gt; 
&gt; I removed a shim from the generator pulley to tighten up the loose belt, and 
&gt; then fired it up.  The idle seems better now, but the bad noise is still there.
&gt; At very low speeds, it sounds like grinding or scraping.  At higher rpms, it 
&gt; goes from a thunk-thunk noise to a growl.  I hear it at all speeds except the 
&gt; very fastest.  It is most pronounced when the engine is accelerating.  The 
&gt; green light is out at all speeds, although I do not have a pressure gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else experienced these noises on their 1600?  Any idea what the
&gt; bad news is?
&gt; 

Well...this could be a number of things.  Who did this rebuild for you?
I want to be sure that I don't ever go there. :[  At first I was thinking
that the noise you described might be the throw-out bearing (T.O. bearing)
and it may be that.  But with a thunk-thunk, I doubt that the T.O. bearing
is the culprit.  I'm wondering if the fan housing is on right.  Or if the
fan in the housing isn't rubbing something by being mis-aligned.  Then
there's the flywheel which may be rubbing the bell housing.  Your right
though, I'd definately want to tear into this thing before I put too 
many more miles on it if any at all.  You don't want this to be any
more expensive than it already is.  Did the rebuilder give a guarantee?
I'd start collecting the paperwork and get ready to do some real reamin'
with the mechanic.  But at first, give him the benefit of the doubt before 
you start to play hard ball with him.  Maybe he'll give you an agreeable
solution to the problem.

Cheers!
