&gt;   Take a big flat screwdriver and pry the flywheel away from the case. There
&gt; should be a tiny amount of endplay,   thunk thunk is junk.   rebuild that
&gt; bottom end.   You can seize yr motor by building it without ANY endplay.
&gt; 
Isn't this just going to bend the flywheel a tiny bit?  I tried to 
measure the endplay on my brand new engine before I installed but 
couldn't get anything to move.  I did the screwdriver plying bit but 
felt I was only bending the flywheel 0.004 or whatever.  I am hoping 
that when I have it out for a new clutch I will have been enlightened 
as to the proper way to check this.  I have the little measuring 
device.  I just can't seem to get ANY movement.  I assume there must 
be some or I wouldn't have gotten these last 3,500 miles.  
Please advise.  Thanks, Jim
