From: &quot;J. Walker&quot; &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;
Subject:      83-85 (and later) survey

&gt;Would it be possible to share with me the following information by replying
&gt;directly to me?
&gt;year, miles, and list of problems (for example, overheating,
&gt;rattling hydraulic lifters,, frequent brake pad replacement, etc.

1988 GL
75,000  miles
1.  added extra grease to all four cv-joints at 300 miles (self-done)
    ... no noise from them since.
2.  battery replaced about two years ago.
3.  * water pump (replaced under warranty)
4.  occassional valve lifter ticking when cold or parked overnight
    on incline.
5.  air conditioning housing fell down and hit me in the head. :(
    repaired (self-done). later, vw had a dealer-service recall on
    this.
6.  front brake pads wear out in about 15,000 miles. replaced
    must about every year. $70 per set from dealer.
    used one set of non-vw pads and they scarred up the rotors. had to
    get rotors turned and resurfaced.
7.  * melted wiring harness around engine/fuel injectors: air cleaner
    box had pinched one of the injector wires and shorted the mess to
    ground (chassis). $1200 to repair (non-dealer). cable-tied the
    wires out of the way next time! &lt;note: 91 model came from factory
    with cable-ties on those wires!!&gt;
    i now have an 88 bus with an 87 brain, idle stabilizer, relays,
    wiring harnes, etc.
8.  replaced oxygen sensor at 50,000 miles (paranoia)
9.  replaced distributor cap and rotor every 25,000 miles (burned
    rather badly. might not 'need' replacing, but i do it anyway)
10. * replaced coolant temp sensor twice. seems like every 25,000 miles.
11. replaced fuel filter every 25,000 miles (paranoia)
12. replaced coolant temp sensor (for dash gauge) once. gauge just
    quite working.
13. replaced coolant expansion tank (not overflow/fill tank), coolant
    level sensor, cap, and gasket at 40,000 miles.
14. replaced transmission fluid, coolant, power steering fluid, and
    brake fluid every two years. am overdue for the next 'enema'.
15. * replaced ALL fuel hoses at about five years (after two leaks in
    one month).

*** Previous Buses ***

1991 GL (automatic)
16,000  miles
1.  added extra grease to all four cv-joints at 300 miles (self-done)
2.  * water pump (replaced under warranty)
3.  occassional valve lifter ticking when cold or parked overnight
    on incline.
4.  front brake pads wear out in about 15,000 miles. replaced
    must about every year. $70 per set from dealer.
    rather badly. might not 'need' replacing, but i do it anyway)
5.  air conditioner compressor (replaced under warranty)
6.  cruise-control stumble/stutter fixed by extra wiring harness gizmo.

1986 GL
44,000 miles
1.  all four-cv-joints replaced (under warranty) at 22,000 miles.
2.  * water pump (replaced under warranty)
3.  occassional valve lifter ticking when cold or parked overnight
    on incline.
4.  front brake pads wear out in about 15,000 miles. replaced
    must about every year. $70 per set from dealer.
** dealer was never able to get rid of stumble/stutter off idle and
   dying at red lights/stop signs. (he never replaced the oxygen sensor
   or the coolant temp sensor ... just kept mucking around with the
   wiring and the throttle switch setting). dealer kept breaking things
   and not fixing things on the car when i brought it in for service.
   car spent 10 of its first 30 days in the shop! died (vapor lock?)
   in rush hour traffic in colorado springs, co, on the side of a
   mountain. not fun.
