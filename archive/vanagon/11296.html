Subject: Re: westy auxillary battery

My 79'  Deluxe Westy already had an auxiliary battery for running the
fridge. I replaced it with a deep cycle battery, which lasted ~30%
longer than the original car battery. Once upon a time I converted a (I
hate to say it) Ford van for camping. I purchased a solenoid from a RV
dealer. It was wired between the two baterries and controlled from the
ignition switch (ie. when the ignition was off then the baterries were
isolated from one another)
