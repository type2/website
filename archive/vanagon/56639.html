Before bleeding the cooling system, you might want to visually check the
level in the coolant reservoir when the coolant level light is blinking.
Your problem might be a bad connection to the sensor. The coolant level
light on my 87 behaves strangely--if I start the van by turning the
ignition switch immediately to start, the light will continue to blink
after the engine is started even though the coolant level is fine. However
if I turn the switch to the run position for a few seconds (I usually just
wait for the fuel pump to do its thing) then all is well. I suspect it's an
electrical problem somewhere in the instrument cluster, but for now I've
trained myself to turn the switch to run for a few seconds.
