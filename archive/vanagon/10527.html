&gt;Hi I'm new here.I own a 1979 bus. I was considering retro fiting a 
&gt;westfalia top from a 1971 bus. The guy wants $100 canadian for the
&gt;top. Has anybody done this before? Is it a pain? Is it worth it.

Hi Gary,

I suggest you take a look at westfalia tops from '74 or later busses.
You'll recognize them easily: the roof rack is in front. The advantage is
that the bed under the pop top sleeps 2 instead of 1.

I don't know about installation, but there was a thread on this topic very
recently (last week or so). You may want to check the gopher archives.

Also: isn't the 79 bus an inch or so wider than the 68-78 ones?

Sami
