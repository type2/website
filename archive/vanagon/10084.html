&gt;&gt;Not exactly.  The steering wheel doesn't come straight up through your
&gt;&gt;knees on the Chrysler or the Honda; you don't have to hunch over to
&gt;&gt;shift gears; your arms aren't spread out wider than your chest when
&gt;&gt;you make a turn; you don't have to move the pedals at an arc opposite
&gt;&gt;the normal travel of your feet; the suspension has more travel than
&gt;&gt;the seat springs....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;:-)

&gt;Are these fightin' words, or what?

You couldn't have a decent fight with this bloke! He's got a puny chest, 
short arms, long legs, and his feet are on backwards  :-)
