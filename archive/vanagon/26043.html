Subject:       VW ad in Rolling Stone

No, I don't read Rolling Stone on a regular basis, but I was lucky 
enough to find something of worth in it when I was reading the issue 
about Jerry Garcia last weekend.

VW has the coolest ad in there.  It's a black Charcol pencil drawing 
of a splittie with a blue teardrop coming out of one of the 
headlights.  No words other than Jerry Garcia, 1942-1995.

I'll scan it in and put it on my Webserver.
