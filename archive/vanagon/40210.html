Subject: Country Homes Poptop

Derek:

We have a 1984 Vanagon Wolfsburg (weekender) that I had the 
Country Homes Pop Top installed on in 1986.  Country Homes 
has two options for the Vanagon.  One is the poptop - takes 
them 4 hours to install.  That gives a top that covers 75% 
of the roof and lifts straight up.  It provides for an upper 
bunk that sleeps two.  The canvas is double thick and
insulated (a must for my family here in Alaska).  Additionally 
it is openable in the front (with both a screen and access 
to the roof above the driver and front passenger area).  
Both sides open as well to screens providing considerably more 
ventilation than the Westy.  You also can sleep in either 
direction.

I carry 6 bicycles (one a tamdem) when we travel as well as 
a tent, bicycle helmets, and a Burley (bicycle trailer) - 
all on the outside of the van.  This would not be possible 
with a Westy - at least not over the Alcan or the thoroughfares 
that pass as roads here in Alaska, without destroying the top.  
With this setup, we can set up the van for sleeping without 
removing the bicycles.   
 
A second option that Country Homes offers is a removable camping 
unit that slides in - in place of the middle seat.  Takes about 
20 minutes to switch from passenger mode to camping mode.  This 
is one option I elected not to purchase.  

Our vanagon is equipped to seat seven and sleep 6 (with a 
hammock over the front seats.  While we have slept seven in the 
van, it works better with the eldest of our five kids off at 
college.  For my family, the Country Homes poptop has worked out 
far better than a Westy ever could.  It has survived -60 degrees 
below, numerous trips up and down the Alcan, and has been a 
daily driver in the far North since new.

We first found out about the Country Homes poptop from a 
Conneticutt family that was touring the contry and had been 
visiting Fairbanks.  I followed their van around town for half 
hour or so until they stopped.  Asked if they could show me the 
poptop and they had their 10-year old son give me the demonstration
and sales pitch.  That was all it took.
