Subject: Re: Advice for 85 Westy Synchro

I *believe* all of the syncros from the factory were built in Gratz (sp?)
Austria, and have a &quot;G&quot; instead of the usual &quot;H&quot; (Hanover ?) in the serial
number, so it should be easy to spot a home-brew.  I verified my Kombi was
not simply a stripped Vanagon by the serial number.

I like the syncro &quot;AT&quot; post as well.
No '88s?

&gt; &gt;I just came across a 1985 Westy Synchro w/50k miles for $10k. Is it worth
&gt; it?
&gt; &gt;What should I be looking for while cheking it out? Advise??
&gt; 
&gt; I'd never buy any 1985 Syncro.  VW did not start selling them until 1986 as
&gt; 1986 models.  Either it's not a Syncro or it's not a 1985 or someone has
&gt; assembled their own hybrid.  Valid Syncro model years in the USA are 1986,
&gt; 1987, 1989, 1990, &amp; 1991.  Question everything else.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
