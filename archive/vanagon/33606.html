All right already!!

Seems this museum issue is getting downright nasty... it's only an opinion. 
And my opinion (which apparently started this mess) was that I hoped our 
semaphore-larceny victim was keeping his pride and joy in a garage. Like 
most of you, I'd like to PARK my bug in a museum for a nightly polish and 
oil change, keep it in top condition, and drive it to work again each 
morning (it's old and had a good life - it deserves pampering)... it's 
therapeutic to do it all at home (cheaper, too). I agree, setting them out 
to the &quot;old volks home&quot; mostly benefits the museum curator, while the rest 
of us lose out on seeing someone's blood, sweat and metal turning heads on 
the road.

I hope you find your semaphores, as I only see the &quot;museum pieces&quot; like 
yours out on the road... where they are appreciated most.
