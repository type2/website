Subject: Hello to Westy In Front of Wax Furniture

I was at the Maryland renaissance fair this weekend, sad to say but no Westy's 
in the vast parking lot.  I did run across a man in Annapolis driving a '63 
panel van. He said it had 500k and spent the first part of it's life in 
Europe.  It was in nice shape. On the way home I came across a &quot;butt ugly 
brown&quot; 83.5 Westy exactly like my own in the Wax Furniture parking lot. I just 
wanted to say hello to the owner in case he/she was a list member.  It looked 
like it was recently re-painted like mine although for some reason mine has a 
big white stripe.
