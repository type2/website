Subject: VWs &amp; 7-up?

Splitters and all:

I'm going to mix metaphors for a moment.  It *is* bus
related, so hang in there.  Within the Split-window bus
niche is the panel van niche.  Within the panel van niche is
a small portion used as rolling advertisement.  Of the panel
vans with advertisement on the side, some advertise the use
of the van (plumbers, deliveries, etc.) and some simply
advertise an un-related product (Coca-Cola for example).
I've seen pictures of the Coca-Cola van (what looks to be
Ruby Red panel with white lettering).  I've seen plastic
models of the same.

The thread on Easy Rider ressurrected a thought about
another collection subject of mine.  Being an Un-Cola
Undergrounder, I always wondered if 7-up had a similar
campaign which utilized a green splittie with its 7-up logo
across the side.  Seems like the Velvet Green background
would be perfect for a silk-screened &quot;You Like It, It Likes
You&quot; across the side.  With the Un-Cola campaign in the late
60s, complete with the Peter Maxx graphics, it just seemed
like a natural.

Anyone ever seen a critter like this?  Just wondering.

Now, back to the 90s.
