&gt;My wife says that, too. I have another one due here Saturday.
&gt;
&gt;The question becomes: How do we weasel? ;)
&gt;
&gt;I can't sell the first one until I fix the ENTIRE driveline, perfectly,
&gt;of course. And it looks way too ratty to sell--what a beater!--so I'll
&gt;have to do something about the body and interior.
&gt;

AH, so THAT's how I do it! hehehe, she knew it was over when I came back
from looking at it with this &quot;Uhh, honey...&quot; looks on my face!

&gt;I figure I'll do the interior in teak and birch. This project should last
&gt;me at least five years. I'm not kidding, either. ;) Couldn't get fifty
&gt;cents for it 'til it's fixed right, sez I...
&gt;

Darned tootin' and you know another way might be --- but honey with just a
little more work you could have this for your very own!  :-)
