Subject:      Re: Insuring a Camper

In Texas, State Farm considers your vehicle a MotorHome as long as it has a
sink in it.

I have been around and around with my agent regarding this.  The only
problem...State Fram will not give you a Multi-car discount (10% of the
top) with a Westie another vehicle.

&gt;&gt; Chris,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I live in Stockton and have lower cost State Farm policy on my 1983.5
&gt;&gt; Adventurewagen. All it took was for my agent to inspect it and submit
&gt;&gt; photo's of the interior and exterior. In California the Adventurewagen's
&gt;&gt; are classified as housecars the same as regular class A, B, and C's. I
pay
&gt;&gt; $541.74 a year but that includes higher coverages as well as comp and
&gt;&gt; collision. When I switched from 3-A to State Farm in 1990 I saved over
$400
&gt;&gt; a year.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure whether the inclusion of the holding tank or Porta-Potti
&gt;&gt; toilet is what's needed to earn the classification. California owners of
&gt;&gt; Westy's could verify whether their campers also have the same DMV
&gt;&gt; classification.
