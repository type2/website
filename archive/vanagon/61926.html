Subject: Summer time blues

The stinking Texas heat is upon us, time when vanagon owners pop the
spare tire out and make sure the unmounted* in line heater hose valve is
turned all the way off.

The problem is that the AC has more than enough work without hot air
coming in from the front.  Making sure the heat is off is the first
step.  But the real problem is that the foam on the vents doors comes
off with age* and you can't stop the air.

Tried to get plastic off to get at vents.  Figured I would break
something first.  Guess VW figured we would never want to do that.

So, take the grill off the front, and with a pointer from the list,
located the vent.  Didn't realize that you have to take another grill
off...  AND it is BEHIND the radiator!  No wonder it is hot!*

It's about 2 1/2 ft long, 2&quot; wide, how to cover?  Cardboard? No. Duct
tape?  Naw, best to stuff it with rags!  Big, took a whole sheet!


I know Vanagon owners have this problem, and that's my solution, FWIW.
(It DOES make a big difference!)
