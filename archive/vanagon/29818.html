Subject: Thank You for &quot;Help! Head Question.&quot;

	Thanks to everyone, for your help.  I have shipped my heads to
Mark Stephens High Performance.  The person I talked to there said that
they think the Spanish Heads with thier valve seats are, &quot;Dinomite!&quot; 
We'll see if they last the 100k warranty.  The price is going to be right
too, about $350 for thier rebuild.  My local machinist wanted me to buy
some VW cores and rebuild those at a cost closer to $500.  That was
without any sort of warranty. I also found out that GEX will accept 
Spanish Heads as cores, so I assume that means that they also sell them as 
thier rebuilds.
	I am looking forward to reassembling my engine before Chrismas.  
I know that there are still many challenges ahead.  I would not have 
tried this top end rebuild without the help and examples from this group.  
Thank You All.  

	Thank You.
