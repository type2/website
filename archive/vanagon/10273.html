&gt; I stomped on them with all my might, putting the proerbial &quot;four men and a 
&gt; boy's&quot; pressure into the system. 
&gt;  
&gt; A rear wheel cylinder promptly exploded, gutting my brakes and rendering my 
&gt; bus undriveable for a bit. 
&gt;  
  Same thing happened to me about 2 years ago. Hitting the barkes hard
(to avoid a swerving bus) stopped me dead, but the pedal continued to
go down all the way, followed by lots of clunking.

 When I stripped the rear left wheel, I found the slave cylinder
had broken clean across below the mounting bolt, fallen down abit
(the brake line stopped it falling too far), and not suprisingly
the handbrake stuff fell out and collected at the bottom of the
wheel. Nice.
