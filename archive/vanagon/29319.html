Subject: Re: 21 window for sale

&gt;I saw the following on halcyon.forsale:
&gt;
&gt;I have a 21 window deluxe Volkswagen completely restored for sale
&gt;Price: $12,500 obo
&gt;The only things I don't like about it are that it pops out of 4th gear
&gt;and has stupid lowpro 80 series tires on it.

$12.5 K and it pop's out of fourth, is this guy for real or what??

 Other than that it is
&gt;PERFECT!

perfect as in &quot;good condition&quot; (really evil grin forming heheheheh....)


&gt;contact me at home 206-776-7456 or page me a 969-8386 or email me
&gt;at kaos_at_rainier_dot_net.
&gt;I NEED A HOUSE DOWN PAYMENT!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


the truth reveals itself!

not malice intended mark mcculley, just could let this messgae pass me by
w/ some response!
