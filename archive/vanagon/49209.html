Subject: Columbus Day Camping Trip

First, a huge thanks to everyone who responded.  The level of interest
shown make me feel this could be a big one.

I had originally thought that after recieving a number of suggestions, I
would post a request for a quick vote, but by far the favorite appears to
be John Anderson's idea of Seneca in the Monongahela NF.  If there is no
objection, I would, therefore, like to propose this as the site.  I will
work out details and directions with John and try to get a map up
somewhere for downloading.

Per the suggestion that Columbus Day is not a universal holiday, I would
suggest that the gathering be for Friday night thru Sunday (Sunday
night/Monday optional. If someone in the Synchro group would like to
organize a 4WD expedition, that would be great.  Pot-luck Saturday night?
Other activities (engine case bonfire {are you guys *really* serious about
this????}) to be organized later.  On the optional Monday, maybe we
could all take our spark suppressors off and go visit the radio
observatory, which I must admit to an interest in.

Sound like a (preliminary) plan?  Additions/suggestions gratefully
appreciated.
