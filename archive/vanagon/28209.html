Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

	Gotta agree- I went with ECI rather than GEX for my
rebuild based a lot on GEX's ad art. My happiness with car mags
is in direct, inverse, proportion to the number of bikini-clad
models used to sell car parts. I look forward to the day
when a woman's body is not a logical thing to use as a background
or foreground in selling car parts.

	Driving to work one morning, I got behind a black Toyota Forerunner
with big lift, big tires, many extra shock absorbers. License plate
surround said &quot;NO, this is NOT my boyfriends 4 X 4&quot;. I couldn't 
see the driver, the vehicle was too far up in the air! 
Normally, I think such things are silly, but that time, I had
to say Right On!
