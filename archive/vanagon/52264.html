Subject: Re: Westfalia features! /f

&gt; We had a thread a while ago about several people not knowing about the oil
&gt; filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt; weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt; revolve!  Any others out there?
I've heard about an optional rack for cooking toast on the fridge 
vent, with the fridge set to &quot;max&quot;.....

;)

It's *almost* friday...!
