Subject: pre 1968 westy roofrack question

(For all you people out there that care I am in the process of restoring an
old 1/3 length woodslat roofrack that was made by Westfalia Werke back in
1965.)

My question involves the  actual roofrack &quot;members&quot; (you know the three
curved &quot;legs&quot; that attach to the drip rail and that the woodslats attach
to). It appears that the &quot;legs&quot; or whatever you want to call them were
originally galvanized w/ a grey galvanixed coating (kinda reminds me of the
finish that minnow pails have on them). Anyways my question is do you know
what the original coating on the &quot;legs&quot; was/is?? I described it to my local
plating house and they thought it was zinc coating. Does anyone know what
the original coating was and how expensive it is to get redone??
