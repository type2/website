Subject:       '57 23-Win to be FS?

Hello volks,

Well yet against all that I hold dear, I think that I am about to sell 
the '57 23- Window.  Yesterday, I found my next vehicular purchase.  
A '65 MB 230SL.  I've dreamed of owning one of these cars for years.  
As a punk college student, I could afford to buy it if I sell the 
bus.

I know someone was interested in a 23-win a while ago.  E-mail 
privately if you are still interested in it.

Someone else PLEASE mail me privately to talk some sence into 
me.  My mother was disgusted when I suggested I sell the '57!
