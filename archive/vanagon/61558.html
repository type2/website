Subject: Vanagons for sale
Date: Wed, 18 Jun 1997 22:04:02 -0400

Hey all,
There are three local Vanagons for sale here in Johnson City, TN, that I've
seen recently.

1)  An '87 Vanagon non-camper.  It is dark blue w/ tinted windows and a
gray stripe all the way around.  It has the alloy wheels but is non-syncro.
 It is at the local dealer, Sherwood Nissan/VW.  If anyone wants me to, I
can find out about it.

2)  An early water-cooled Vanagon, apparently for sale by owner and in for
service at the same VW dealer.  It is also dark blue w/ the standard 14&quot;
wheels painted black w/ the chrome VW logo hubcaps.  It looks pretty good,
tho I don't know what kind of work it's in for.

3)  An air-cooled Vanagon Westy that I spotted while making a pizza
delivery in my '81.  It's a bronze color w/ white pop-top.  Looks pretty
good, the grille has a chunk missing on the right side.  I will probably go
check this one out more thoroughly after work tomorrow.

If anyone wants any information about these, please let me know ASAP.

Johnson City TN is in northeastern TN, about a half-hour's drive from the
VA border and an hour and a half east of Knoxville.

Sean
