Subject: OEM Vanagon Side Mirrors $19.95

I'm working on a bulk buy of Bus mirrors for the Type 2 list, from the 
original German manufacturer.  Can also get Vanagon mirrors (pre-89, not 
the late-model power ones) for $19.95 in the process. Anyone interested 
please e-mail me directly.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
