Subject: 2liter2cooler?

My question is simple - Is it possible (and appropriate) to hook up an 
external oil cooler while keeping the stock one installed?
 My recent rebuild (4500 miles) seems to be working out well - oil temps 
here at 2000 ft altitude generally ranged from 180-200 degrees, but now 
as outside air temps have gone around 80 - my oil temps can rise as high 
as 230 pulling up some of these hills. From what I've read in the 
archives this is not at all uncomnmon - and people speak of 250 
regularly, but that seems too hot to me. I'd been told as far as remote 
coolers go (I'm interested in the 'plate' style, rather than tube and fin)
that it's either the remote or the stock. Is that so?
