Subject: Re: 85 Vanagon Head Gasket Question

&gt;My Vanagon has 115000 miles and I hear that this about when the head 
&gt;gasket likes to just blow out.  What signs should I be looking for which 
&gt;will indicate that I am about to empty my bank account on another engine?

How the HE_L did you make it that long without a leak?  Consider yourself one
of the lucky few.  I had to replace the head gaskets on my '88 at 66K miles,
and that was with religious coolant changes in an attempt to keep from having
the problem.  I now have 94K miles, and (knocking feverishly on wood) have
not had a problem since.  BTW,  you shouldn't need a new engine just because
your head gaskets leak.  Take care of your van, change the coolant often, and
be religious about watching the collant level in the tanks.  At the first
sign of a level drop, get the thing in to a reputable place of service and
have it checked immediately.  Although having the head gaskets replaced is
not cheap, it's definitely better than a new engine!

Good Luck!
