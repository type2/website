Subject: Re: Burning Buses

Was a lot about this recently..in fact I even collated it all for Cyberspli=
t
(section in SSVC mag)....basically the most common cause is faulty fuel lin=
e
and also include in this the little brass tube that sits in the carb the fu=
el
line attaches to. They work loose...fuel splills on hot engine...KAPOW! Not=
 a
pretty sight. Of course there are other causes..elecrical d=A3shorting and I
even know one bus that burned out due to sticking brake shoes catching fire
initially...
Check your fuel line fittings to be on the safe side. Older buses are more
prone simply due to wear and vibration and lots of removals/diconnections
etc...
