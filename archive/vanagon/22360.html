I too had a coolant leak from the rear heater in my 87 Syncro. Developed
whilst I was on a 4X4 trail about 15 miles from a paved road.  Coolant was
squirting out at an alarming rate but I managed to get to a gas station
before I lost too much.  Turns out that it was the little white plastic vent
plug.  I think it cost about a dollar or two.  Now I carry a spare in each
van!
