Bruce,

I had about the same thing happen to me, mine was a main oil seal. Parked
it, it was just fine, but the next morning I had a large puddle of oil.
Hopefully this is not the case for you, when the seal goes, if it's bad
enough, it can destroy your clutch. (Very expensive repair :( ) Yours may
be different though, see if you can run it until it gets hot then look
under while the engine is running (thus oil pressure is up) to see exactly
where it's dripping from. This will help get a better idea of what the
problem is. Make sure you keep a REAL close eye on your oil level. When the
oil leaks out it tends to spread out and look like a whole lot more then it
actually is, but always be safe and check it often,...
