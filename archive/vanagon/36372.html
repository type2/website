Sean,

Now that you are off your rant, how about a story by a thoroughly 
pleased EV owner. We bought our EV 3 years ago this month...had to 
accomodate (at the time) a new born, a 13 and 9 year old. It was the first
VW van I had bough in 10 years (had tons of T1 Type 2s during the 70s..the
last one was a 67 camper). Sure, it had the engine in the &quot;wrong&quot; location
and it was water cooled....but it was roomy enough, well engineered enough 
and built well enough to be just as good as any product VW produced.

Right now it has 43k miles. Repairs have been minimal...fan resistors
last year (I have the old ones...and the receipt...gonna turn them back
into VW and claim the warranty from last year's purchase...voila,
&quot;free&quot; back up set). We replaced the Continental tires at 35k miles
and two weeks ago I had the front pads replaced. Thats it!

Ooops...ok...I replaced the battery last month. I was being anal-retentive
as my wife would say...the battery was three years old, and rather than
being stranded at some point in the future, I figured it was time to
chuck in a DieHard.

The EV has taken us on several long distance trips....back and forth
to work....thru the snow....thru the rain, etc. Never had to worry about
it starting, stopping, getting heat, etc. In fact twice it had to sit
in the snow for over a month while we were in France....and when we got
back, just dusted it off...got in and VRRRMMMMMM it started!

My only major complaint about the EV is that VWUS screwed up in its 
marketing effort, or lack thereof for the EV. There are TONS of T4s
in Europe....the line there includes single cab, double cab pick up
trucks, delivery vans, passenger vans, etc...4 cyl, 5 cyl gas...4 &amp; 5
cylinder diesels (some now with turbos)....from what I saw over
there they are bullet proof workhorses.

I would rather have a van that is still built on a ladder type chassis than
the uni-shit-box construction of a Caravan, etc. I have a neighbor who 
bought one of those Carashitboxes about the same time we bought the EV..
we have more miles on ours...his squeaks...minor trim pieces are 
loose...ours is still solid!

BTW we blew his (our neighbor) mind this weekend...bought a new kitchen
set (table and 6 chairs) still in their packing boxes...not a problem
pop down the rear seat...slide in the box with the table (30 x 60 x 8),
and three boxes containing the chairs (24 x 24 x 36). Still had room
to seat the (now) 3 year old kid in the remaining jump seat in the back...
