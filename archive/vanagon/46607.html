&gt;ambient pollution.  Anyone know about this development?  

Hi all:  In November, '95 Ford Motor Company announced that they, in
conjunction with Engelhard Corporation (NYSE - CE) were launching an
international test of &quot;ozone destroying radiators.&quot;  The test was scheduled
to run for nine months.  Initial research indicated that the new technology
could turn an ordinary car radiator into smog-eating filtration systems that
would actively fight pollution as they drove along.  That was the last I
heard about it.  I'll have to see if I can find anything new.
