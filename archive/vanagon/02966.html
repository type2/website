&gt;I was talking to the parts guy at the local dealership.  He said that VW
&gt;has a deal to replace ANY vanagon engine for $2495 complete.  Something to
&gt;do with recalls and stuff so they just made a blanket rule.  He also
&gt;mentioned that most VW dealerships would try to steer you away from this
&gt;option to instead rebuilding your engine because the VW dealership makes
&gt;no money on the new engine under this plan due to the way the plan is set up.

well, i just phoned in to the dealer in atlanta, and, yup. but it is NOT
a 'new' engine.

it's a factory rebuilt engine with new heads, and atlanta's price was $2380
NOT including labor, which they figured at 10 hours _at_ 52.00/hour. so it looks
like a vw dealer rebuilt could be had for right at $3000.

oh, yeah. those are the water-cooled engines, by the way. BOTH of them, the
1983-85 (DH) 1.9 liter and the 1986-91 (MV) 2.1 liter engines.
