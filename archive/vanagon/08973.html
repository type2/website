So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Sheesh, I'm scared to put any more time and effort into this baby - its 
&gt; going to end up being someones parts store!  100% discount!  I can see
&gt; my brand new engine and tranmission in someone else's lowered, primered
&gt; piece of shit!
&gt; 
I'm real sorry this is happening to you Thom.  For as rare a vehicle as 
yours is, I'd seriously consider taken off the rotor or coil wire before
I left it out over night.  It'd be a hassle, but better than finding no
car in the morning.  Of course you could get a shotgun and sleep in it
over night, but that's pretty extreme.

See ya tonight,

Steven
