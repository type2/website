Hi Gary! My field of study is Marine Ecology and Aquaculture. Now I'm teaching
Human Ecology and General Biology. My love for VWs started when I visited Ger-
many back in 1976 in a trip from Moscow to Madrid. Since then I owned 13 bee-
tles and 6 busses, and I'm waiting for Concept 1 (C-1) that is coming in 1997.
Keep practicing your spanish and I hope that someday you'll meet me here in
Puerto Rico or in my homeland, Dominican Republic. Say hello to your wife and
let's keep our friendship growing.
Saludos,

Angel
