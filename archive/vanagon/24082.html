Subject: Re: Road sign interpretations

My favourite recent signage is one that we spotted on the way to Sequoia 
National Park, near Visalia. The sign is huge and has the words &quot;Left Wing 
Liberals&quot; with the red circle and slash through it. Perhaps right wing liberals 
and middle of the road liberals are still ok?
