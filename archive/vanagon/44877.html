There's a guy across town that has a '69 Westy that has modified the air
scoops in the rear pillars.  He has fashioned some black sheet metal scoops
and added them to the factory air scoops using pop rivets.  His camper is 
white and with those black &quot;ears&quot; on it looks like a member of the Mickey
Mouse Club.  Who cares if it looks goofy, it probably runs cooler.
