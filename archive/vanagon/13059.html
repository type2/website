Subject: Wasserboxer ATF cooler replacement

Last week I smelled funny smells from the engine compartment of
our '88 Westy, and discovered red oily stuff floating on top of
the coolant -- and found that the automatic-transmission fluid
level was very low.  After perusing Bentley a bit, I discovered
the existence of the transmission-fluid cooler: a little thang 
that fits on the front of the transmission and lets coolant pass through
and cool the ATF.  Obviously it had ruptured inside and let
the fluids commingle (luckily, the leakage appears to be
one-way: from the transmission into the cooling system -- no
coolant evident in the transmission).

Anyway, $160 later, I had the new cooler in hand, and was ready to
remove the front transmission mount to get to the old cooler and
remove it, but I found that the upper of the two bolts that attach
the cooler to the transmission couldn't be extracted all the way, as
it would bump into the frame crossmember.  So my question (there
had to be one here somewhere) is: can I just remove the transmission
mount and let the whole thing down the necessary 2 inches without
detaching the transmission from the engine?  Would it be sufficient
to loosen the rear motor mounts to provide enough hinge effect?
Would lowering the tranny 2&quot; in place break or bend the shift linkage?

If this apparently-minor job requires pulling the transmission all
the way out, I think I'll let the shop do it...
