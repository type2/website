Subject: Re: EV Jumpseat Question

Scott,

I have not had any problems with the removable seats in my MV.

However, I just received a ton of technical manual on the Eurovan and one 
covers the interior and trim components specifically.  I'll check and see 
if it has anything you can use and let you know.

To the rest of the Eurovan owners on the list, I haven't had the chance 
to post exactly what I got.  But I have many technical reference manuals 
and I'll try to post exactly what they cover tonight.

If I can help anyone let me know.

&gt; I have a 93'MV weekender with the removable passenger side jump seat.  This
&gt; seat is loose when attached to the vehicle.  It appears that the two (2)
&gt; extensions that stick into the floor have to enter the floor behind (toward
&gt; the rear of the vehicle) the bar in the floor to allow the seat to click into
&gt; the passengers seat.  Looking at these extensions it looks as if they are
&gt; supposed to enter the floor in front of the bar (toward the front of vehicle)
&gt; this would allow the seat to be alot sturdier.  I have tried to move the
&gt; latch to allow for this.  But unfortunately there isn't that much adjustment.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Have any other EV owners had this problem?
&gt; 
&gt; This is differcult to explain with text,  give me a e-mail if you have any
&gt; further questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
