&gt; There is a place in Laguna Beach that rents 'falias.  But you
&gt; said you'll probably fly to Oregon or Washington.  But if
&gt; you have some big goolies, you could fly to Orange County
&gt; and RT up the CA coast to Oregon or Washington.
Flying in to California shouldn't be a problem. Do you have a phone
number for this place???
thanks
Richard
