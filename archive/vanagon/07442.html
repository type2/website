Subject:      idle hands are the Devil's workshop ...

so, here i'm sitting, with my thumb up my ear. ;) and i thinks to myself,
&quot;self&quot;, says i to me, &quot;there seems to be an awful lot of HP people on this
list.&quot;

so i gets to checking:
       on the list      in my file
HP         6               9
Microsoft  2               3
Intel      1               5
Sun        3               5
Tekronix   2               2
IBM        2               3

all the other aparent 'companies' were lower numbers.

then i looks at the colleges:
stanford   5               8
ohio       4              10
washington 4               7
unc        3               4
lehigh     2               2
wisc       3               4
wustl      3               3

well, anyway. i thought it was kinda curious. kinda strange that there are
so many buses at stanford and ohio state and washington ... at least, buses
that have access to internet.

anybody that wants me to check out their company/school, lemme know. it's
very likely i missed some.
