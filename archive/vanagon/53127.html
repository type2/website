Subject: Re: avon or nokia sno tires

I just put a set of Hakkaapelitta 10's on my Audi Coupe Quattro. These
are directional snow tires that supposedly last for 40,000 miles and they
turned my CQ into a snow-machine.

Greer Enterprises in Milwaukee (414-545-2296) sell Nokia tires and they
don't charge for shipping.  I didn't buy from them but I would have
if I'd known about them before buying from a dealer in Minneapolis.
Would have saved me almost $30.

All disclaimers apply.
