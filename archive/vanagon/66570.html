Subject:      '85 Sliding Door handle and Top Hatch needed

I'm have been looking for a outside door handle for my '85 Westfalia
without much luck.  It is the small length handle I believe they started
using on the '85s for the first time.

I've found some in catalogs and at &quot;dealers&quot;, but only for well over
$100.00.

I would be happy to buy even a used one.  I am getting tired of opening
the passenger door and opening the sliding door.

(By  the way, it broke off last winter here in Moscow while trying to
open it in -24 C weather.   While opening the door I suddenly found
myself laying on my back in the snow still holding the handle.  It was a
good thing the door was facing the sidewalk and not the street. )

---

Also I am looking for a replacement vent or hatch window my Westfalia
pop-top.  Mine has been broken for a while and now has a hole in it [yes
from people trying to rest the top on their heads while closing the top
=-(    ]

Any suggestions for cheap parts,

Mike

P.S. I have a US address that I can mail parts to.
