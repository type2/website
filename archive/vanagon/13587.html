Hooray for Mr. Abbott!

I have only owned one air-cooled VW and that was when I was in college and
it was a 1971 VW Bus, the last of the true Beetle Busses as far as I was
concerned.  I traded it for a 1975 VW Rabbit and since then I have owned a
1980 Westmoreland Rabbit, 1981 Passat/Dasher Diesel, 1985 Jetta and a 1992
Passat.  My most recent VW purchase has been a 1985 Vanagon GL.

The argument could be made that VW didn't alter their market strategy fast
enough, at least not fast enough for the market in North American north of
the Rio Grande.  Current emission control standard in the United States and
Canada dictated that VW stop sending air-cooled vehicles to this country in
the early 70s and yet VW continued sending us the Beetle in large quantities
until 1978 and air-cooled busses until 1983.
&gt;
&gt;3. The &quot;added complication&quot; of modern VW's has meant incredible gains 
&gt;in fuel economy. Again, late Beetles could get around 25 to 30 mpg 
&gt;with a nominally 50 hp engine. My '87 GTI gets better mileage from an 
&gt;engine capable of putting out TWICE the horsepower, with far better 
&gt;longevity.

My 1985 Jetta consistently got 38 MPG on the highway with an 85 HP engine,
my 1992 Passat Wagon gets 34 MPG with 134 HP now.  This versus most
air-cooled figures of 20-25 MPG with large amounts of emissions.  My Passat
produces NO measurable hydrocarbons at 52,000 miles.  It concerns me that my
1985 Vanagon produces as much HC as it does, 180 at last measurement--not
too far from failing emissions testing in Metropolitan Atlanta.


&gt;the Beetle plunged, and sales of Japanese imports surged. The Beetle 
&gt;was and is a great car design, but VW stayed with it too long. People 
&gt;voted with their dollars- and the majority didn't vote for the Beetle.

Sadly VW may never regain market share from even where they were in the
middle 1980s!  VW sold something like 175,000 to 200,000 VW Jettas the year
1986.  I'd be surprised if they sold half of that (of all models) in N.
America this year.  VW makes hay of the fact that their sales are up by
twice from last year, VW also neglects to say that they had almost no
product available for sale in the U.S. last year.
&gt;
&gt;5. Yes, VW has never recovered its US market share since the hey-day 
&gt;of the Beetle, but Europe is a different story. The first, second, and 
&gt;now third generations of the Golf have all been *best sellers* in 

VW does extremely well in almost all markets but the the North American one
(and actually they still do pretty well in Canada).
&gt;
&gt;6. Arguments such as &quot;you can't get a Jetta engine out and on the 
&gt;bench in 45 minutes&quot; are silly. Much of what has complicated the 
&gt;engine bay is required for emission control- VW had no choice in that. 
&gt;More over, in my opinion, it's a lot less important how easy it is to 
&gt;get a Golf or Jetta engine out because you don't *have* to do it 
&gt;nearly as often!

My 85 Jetta is still running around Atlanta with 150,000 plus miles on it
and thankfully the engine has never been out of the bay--the closest to an
engine repair has been a replacement water pump and a new valve cover gasket .

I love my water-cooled VW--I find VW decisions about some things very
frustrating and yet I still continue to buy them.  I guess this is because
the alternative Nissans, Toyotas and Hondas just don't appeal to me.  Oddly
enough, if the German/English versions of GM and Ford were available here
I'd probably be buying those as well.

Thanks again, Ian.  This one couldn't agree with you more.

You know why the reason why some nights
you don't have a dream?
When there's just blackness?
And total silence?

Well, this is the reason:
It's because on that night
you are in somebody else's dream.
And the reason you can't
be in your own dream because
you're already busy
in somebody else's dream.

  -Laurie Anderson, Stories from the Nerve Bible (1993)
