How solid are the grounds from the engine to body? We had a hard time
starting as well. Grounds running from the distributor base, engine block and 
fan housing must all be solidly connected to the  body of the vehicle
which in turn must have  a very solid  ground to the battery (big mutha
wire.) Every single electrical connector must be shiny and clean....DC
