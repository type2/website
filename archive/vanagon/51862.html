&gt; Hello all, I am Greg Whitcomb.  I am looking for an 80 - 88 camper.  I
&gt; live in Western North Carolina, but my family lives in Charlotte NC.  We
&gt; would be willing to drive for it.  I am mostly looking for a good
&gt; interior, and not a lot of rust.  The mechanical cond. is fairly
&gt; inportant, as long as it will get me from your house to Charlotte.  If
&gt; you have what I am looking for, then please drop me a line.  This
&gt; vehicle is for my father.  He had an 86 a few years back and it had some
&gt; problems, and my mother made him sell it.  But now we are in the markte
&gt; for another.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help.
