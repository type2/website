 Crested Butte, Colorado.
 where he saw:
&gt;  custom
&gt; bike and ski racks. I noticed some real interesting installations
&gt; including a Thule roof rack mounted on the rear hatch.

I saw a bus in North Vancouver (on the day of the VW show so it might have been an 
out-of-towner) that had a Thule rack with the real load bar mounted ant the VERY back of 
the pop-top.  There we bike fork-mounts (I think they were Thule but didn't get a close 
look) mounted on this load bar such that the bikes hung down the back of the bus.  Don't 
think you could get to the engine w/out removing the bikes.  Anyone else ever try this?  
I can't remeber if the load bar was mounted to the pop-top or on the rain gutters (via 
the super high feet).
