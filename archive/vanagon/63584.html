Subject: 91 Westy Sold,keeping 86 syncro Westy

Thank you for all of the inquiries over the past few months about our
Westies for sale.  The 91 is the one that went to a California fanatic, and
we've decided not to part with our Syncro.  We had people interested in the
vans from all over, particularly the West coast, even though we're in NJ.
All of you from the tri-state area owe us one--we are guaranteed a snow-free
winter now that we have decided to keep the Syncro!

We're taking a road trip to Maine next week, look for our 86 Westy Syncro,
NJ plates, brown with the 2 kayaks and 2 mtn bikes on top!!!
