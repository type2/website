Subject: Re: '81 Vanagon heater question

Sorry about the lack of context on this question; MH doesn't like
the way the digest is packaged and won't split the messages out,
so replying is a PAIN.

My basic feeling is that the '80's bus heaters are better but
still inadequate.  I'm starting to think gas heater...

Anyway, when I first got my Vanagon, it was moderately warm, and
would heat up inside and clear the windows if left to idle.  It
was moderately comfortable (i.e., light jacket :) down to about
10 degrees F.  Nowadays (not counting its engineless state) it
is good down to about 20-30, and never will clear the windows if left
to idle.  The heat is pretty ineffectual except in the summer when
it's overwhelming :).  I'm wondering if the little expand-o-tube that
pulls on the engine flaps is actually functional.  It looks about
the same (fully extended) outside at 30F as it does inside at
75F.  I wonder if it is never closing or something?  I haven't really
worked out how the system works.  As far as I could see, the
engine flaps never moved.
