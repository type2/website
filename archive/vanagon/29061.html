I went and looked at the '64 single cab last night and had to pass.  
It needs more work up front than I am willing to do.  I still have 
enough to do on the '71.  I said I would pass along the info so here 
it is.  I guess these things aren't as rare as I thought (this is the 
only one I personally have ever seen) so you might not want to trek to
the middle of the country for it.  Please reply to the phone number 
below.  I told the owner I would post this.

I drove the thing a mile or two.  Brakes were very soft.  He said he 
had had them worked on recently.  Maybe they just needed bled or 
adjusted again.  Engine had a tick.  I don't know if it was an 
expensive noise or just a valve a little out of adjustment.  I didn't 
get a chance to run a compression test.  He said the motor is out of a
'68.  It looked a lot like my 1600 so I guess he might be right.  Had 
a new voltage regulator.  It is still all 6 volt.  Exhaust is fairly 
new, I didn't check out the heat.  It did have heater boxes.  It had a
reasonable amount of power.  Nothing like my '71 racer. :)

The steering box is on the way out.  It has a 'tight' spot in it.  
Maybe it isn't the streering box.  It is lacking interior door panels,
headliner is shot.

The paint is orange-red and fairly fresh.  I don't know exactly how 
much rust or bondo it is hiding.  There was some bondo looking stuff 
flaking on one of the rear corners.  There was evidence of rust under 
the right windshield that had been painted over.  There was also some 
rust up under the wheel wells in front of and behind the rear wheel.  
You had to poke around there to find it.  Jack points looked strangley
solid.  It has the original front turn signals but they have been 
moved to the front bumper.  I don't know why.  Maybe there was rust 
where they were supposed to be.

I guess that is about it.  I am sorry I didn't check it out more 
closely.  After the drive I knew it needed more than I could afford in
the short term so I lost some interest.  He said he would be happy to 
see $800-1000.  The car is located in Lincoln Nebraska, one hour 
southwest of Omaha, three hours northwest of Kansas City.  The owners 
name is Phil Tegeler 402-421-3748.
