Subject: 71 air cleaner installation
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 1995 06:02:54 -0700 (PDT)


Hi folks,

Sorry if you already read this on rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled.

I'm having trouble swapping a custom air cleaner with a stock one so my
bus will pass the smog test.  Currently the oil filler breather and
the output of the EEC canister are routed via a T-fitting to an input
at the base of the carburetor.  Which of these is supposed to go to
the 1/2&quot; fitting on the stock air cleaner?

The used air cleaner only has one 1/2&quot; fitting.  Am I supposed to have
two on a 71 air cleaner?  I know the one I was sent is not the right
year because it has no thermostat on it, but I thought they were exactly
the same from 68-71 other than the thermostat.  Will my air cleaner
work?  (Bentley says don't get the hoses confused but doesn't show a
picture of the way it's supposed to be.)  

My other point of confusion is that the air preheater hose is supposed
to go down through the tin to a stovepipe.  Where does the stovepipe
go and where does the warm air come from?  I currently don't have a
hole for the preheater hose in the tin; it looks like I will have to
cut one (sigh) to get the thing to pass.  Where (exactly) should this
hole go?

I'd appreciate any help yall can provide.  Looks like I really got
screwed by the previous owner of this van, who put in a new engine
with no regard to meeting smog requirements.  In the meantime my
beautiful new 71 is sitting idle.

Regards,
Matt
