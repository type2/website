Subject: '87 synchro advice needed

Help me.... I've just viewed an '87 synchro that's for sale. Obvious 
problems are a rusty exhaust system, a non-working rear differential lock, 
and bad rear wheel bearings. Power mirrors are dead too. No air cond! What 
else should be checked out? Any synchro specific tests I can do? I have my 
2wd '85 for a comparison basis BTW, the synchro is quite a bit heavier in 
feel, despite power steering. Drop links on sway bars are intact. Very hard 
for me to find first gear, ultra-low gear was OK. Any thoughts on the 
differential lock problem $$ wise? Cosmetics: interior, paint, tires are 
medium grade, maybe good at best.
        The synchro has 70K miles, cylinder head seals + pushrods appear 
dry, some coolant traces/crust around the cyl. head nuts however. No oil 
leaks at engine case. I am concerned most about the transmission/diffs. CV 
joints seem intact. What else could be wrong with this beast? I was going to 
negotiate for a coolant + brake/clutch system flush and fill, anything else 
to wheel and deal with?
        I am planning on buying on the strength of a 6 month powertrain 
warranty, but is this adequate insurance/time to find out the bugs. 
Subframe/lower body undented, so I assume little serious off-roading has 
been done. No trailer hitch either! Buying this beast will mean putting my 
'85 panel up for sale, which is a trusted vehicle I've owned since '86, a 
tough call.    

awaiting your replies anxiously,   tim s.
