I've got an '86 Westfalia.  Westside Independent (VW and Porche
specialists (never seen a Porshe there yet)) Auto Repair's been
&quot;getting&quot; a new muffler for me for over three weeks now.  Layne, the
owner, got real rude when I asked him if this was normal, told me I
could check myself if I wanted to, see what he's going through.  So,
having another resource, I'm asking:  Is this for real, weeks to get a
muffler without a lead yet, or is this guy blowing me off and doesn't
have the equipment to tell me bout it outright?

I'd suspect him less if he just apologized and told me why it was taking
so long.  Getting rude when I ask calm questions about the quality of my
service does two things:  tells me there's something to hide, and sends
me elsewhere.  

But I want to check first, see if he's maybe giving it to me straight.

Scott
