Subject: Re: A good tire deal or not?

&gt;I need to replace the tires on my 85 Westy.  I got a quote from Merchants
&gt;tire here in Springfield VA of $76.95 per tire (includes mount, balance,
&gt;stems, disposal) + tax. The tire is a 205/70R14, Perrelli P-400, load rang B
&gt;(1433lbs capacity) with an 80,000 tread warantee.
&gt;
&gt;Is this a good deal or should I keep shopping?  I called about 3 or 4 FLAPS
&gt;and no one could find 205/70R14s in load rang C or D.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone in the DC metro area have any luck finding a good deal on tires?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;

I'm running P400's of that size on my 91 and like them better than the
original Michelins, but I hear rumors that a little narrow (195) in a load
range C works better.
BTW, I have a '71 mercedes 220!
