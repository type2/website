Volkswagen Bus
--------------

As a young lad
I never saw the light
I was called a cad
I could usually be counted on to start a fight,

My parents, my counselors would make such a fuss
You see, I never did drive a Volkswagen Bus.

I barely got out of high school
Some would say, that boy's a fool

My parents, my counselors would make such a fuss
You see, I never did drive a Volkswagen Bus.

I joined the Army,
I travelled the world
some said I was smarmy
I thought I was cool.

My parents, my sargents would make such a fuss
You see, I never did drive a Volkswagen Bus.


I got out of the Army, my parents said go to school,
I wanted to party, I wanted to have fun
I'm not stupid, I'm no fool
I would rather play in the sun.

My parents, my grandparents would make such a fuss
You see, I never did drive a Volkswagen Bus.

Now I'm older,
I'm straightening my life
I'm little more sober
I'm not causing stress and strife

My parents, my wife no longer make a fuss
You see, now I drive a Volkswagen Bus.
