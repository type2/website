&gt;&gt;one question:  where is the best place to put a temp sensor that doesnt
&gt;&gt;require case drilling or engine removal?  why would a dipstick sender be
&gt;&gt;better than a sump sender (as mentioned earlier to be the advice of gene
&gt;&gt;berg)?  this placement is just below the dipstick, anyway.

Hmmm... I guess nobody read my post.  Either that or nobody believes me.  *sigh*
