Subject: re:BUSES, VALUE, &amp; RESALE

&gt;From an insurance point of view, I was quoted $150 a year for coverage
&gt;when I asked about a '78 bus, IN DC, &amp; I'M IN MY 20's.  I was told
&gt;that personal property tax would be $25.  This is great for now, but
&gt;what happens when some fool hits me? (After all, DC can be pretty
&gt;crazy)  Do I get a check from the insurance company for $50 because
&gt;that's all it is worth?  I know an appraiser can give a value for an
&gt;individual vehicle, but I was wondering if indeed there are older
&gt;bluebook values with fair, good, excellent conditions, etc.  I seldom
&gt;see buses for sale here in Wash DC and they vary so much that is
&gt;almost impossible to compare.  I am going nuts trying to get one (even
&gt;though I've never even stuck my head in one).  If I had a baseline
&gt;&quot;value&quot;, I could add or subtract extra costs necessary to get it in
&gt;the condition I want.  Again, any advise is appreciated.

The personal property tax is a percentage on the value of the vehicle.
Is the $25 per year, or every 6 months.  When I lived in Virginia, I
was paying $20 every 6 months for an '85 Dodge Colt.  Is your bus
registered in Washington DC, or Virginia, at least when I lived there
Washington had their own license plates.  Your registration card, or title
would have the book value of the vehicle(or sales price, which ever is
higher) printed on it, that is what the personal property tax is based on.
I would imagine that the insurance value is close to that figure.  Your
insurance company should give you that figure, if you ask for it.


Just my $.02
