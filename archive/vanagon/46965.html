&lt;&lt; Red Line Water Wetter is a surfactant - reduces the surface tension of 
 the water. Allows the water to more intimately contact
 metal. When the water boils, the surfactant makes smaller bubbles, which 
 makes it easier for the bubble to be pushed away
 from the metal surface, and allow more water to contact the metal. 
 
 Water Wetter has a high Ph, but also has silicates, so it can be used in 
 aluminium radiators. However, if left for a long time, the
 silicates are depleted, and damage will occur. The liquid versions of 
 Water Wetter do not have phosphates.

Thanks for the info. Tom!

I still have a concern based on the above, and that is, what will it do to a
Vanagon aluminum engine? High pH can indeed corrode aluminum. Aluminum is
attacked by both very high pH and very low pH. Question is.....how high is
the solution of Wetter Water and.....how long does the silicate last? I'm not
even sure if silcates will totally protect aluminum from corrosion if the pH
is high enough?

Could be an expensive answer by just trying it without a proof statement from
the manufacturer! How about a small amount of common dishwashing detergent in
the cooling system, but not enough to foam.....that's probably the main
problem with regular stuff.
