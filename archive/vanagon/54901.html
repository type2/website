My '86 was had a metal cover.  My '91 is plastic but it also came with a
felt cover over the whole engine area.

&gt; &gt;Concerning the engine lid though, all later models (87+) I've seen came
wth

lid.
&gt; &gt; I think VW changed over sometime between 82 &amp; 86 from metal to plastic
on
&gt; &gt;all the lids.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anyone know when this change was made?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm fairly sure that my '90 has a metal lid.
