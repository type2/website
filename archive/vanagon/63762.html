In a message dated 97-08-12 19:08:08 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt;   brings me to the Hall sender  I tried testing it with a
 multimeter(digital Fluke 77) but didn't get a blip. Bentley says to use a
 digital probe.  I also did the ground the center lead of the plug to the
 hall center to get 4.5Volts across the coil and didn't get change in
 voltage.  &gt;&gt;

A little clarification.  Did you check the power supply to the hall unit or
just the hall sender itself?  If you didn't get a blip from the hall sender
itself that is the faulty part not the control unit.
