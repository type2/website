Subject: Re: Reimo Tents &amp; Alternatives

Hi,

Thanks for putting this together.  I might be interested, however I'd like
to know more about the tent and how much it costs.  Can we see it at a web
site or can you sent brochures?  My Westy is an '85.  I'd heard that the
tent that was available in Germany for the Vanagon doesn't have a floor.
Is this the same tent, and if so wouldn't this be a problem in the rain? 

Last year I mail-order purchased a Eureka! model for side attaching to
vans. At ~$500 it is a great tent but it doesn't really mount next to the
van the way I'd hoped, so I havn't used it camping yet. I'm considering
divising a way to connect the VW door to the tent, but it seems tricky
with the VW sliding door and all. 

Another alternative I looked into is the awnings that can be side mounted
to the VW campers.  One company has a tent package that fits with the
awning.  Although it looks really convienient and easy to put up it has a
big downside.  The company states that it cannot be left up in &gt;15 mph
winds.  I can't imagine going to sleep knowing that if a gust comes up my
awning and tent would be ripped off the van!

Thanks,
Ivan (boyd_at_unm_dot_edu)

&gt;      Called Reimo this morning and found out two things:
&gt;      
&gt;      1. It costs almost as much to ship a single tent to the US as it costs 
&gt;      for the tent.
&gt;      
&gt;      2. They are hopeful that they'll have a North American dealer sometime 
&gt;      this summer.
&gt;      
&gt;      Meanwhile, are there 10 or 20 of us who would like to &quot;share&quot; a bulk 
&gt;      shipment of tents?
