Subject: Re:  cruising speed

&gt; At 75 I spin just under 4500 rpm, at 70 I'm at about 4100 rpm.  I am
&gt;running a stock GL syncro with 215 R75 14 BF Goodrich T/A radials.
&gt;The green zone on the tach fades out at 4500rpm the rev limiter is set at
&gt;about 5200.  Top speed is about 85mph.  Don't like to run it there for long,
&gt;just had to know.

I had my girlfriend blow a kiss in the gas tank, and I got it up to 90
