&gt;
&gt; This is the tire table that I refered to in my post a few days ago.  It
&gt; originally came from Eurotire in NJ, and I got it off the list some time
&gt; ago, but didn't find it the archives.  I hope it is helpful to someone.
&gt;
&gt; All diameters are in millimeters, with tire installed on narowest rims
&gt; approved for that tire size.  Wider rims would give slightly smaller
&gt; diameters.
