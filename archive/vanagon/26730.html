Subject: Antenna Replacement AAARRRGGGHHH!

Does anyone know of a way to get at the antenna of an '88 GL without
completely dismantling the dash?  I need to replace the antenna (snapped it
off in a car wash, DUH!), but it looks like I'll have to take the whole #$%_at_&amp;
dash out to do it.  Any shortcuts?
