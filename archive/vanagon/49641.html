Hey - everybody - your canvoy sounds like fun! Wish we were joining you 
- but we're already here!

:-)

Can't wait for you all to get here - it's much warmer today and we're 
going to have a BLAST!

Have fun on the road and like my Alpine Ski Coach used to tell me 
before every race:

&quot;CHEAT DEATH AT EVERY TURN!&quot;

:-)

See ya soon!

XOXOXOXO
