Subject: For Sale 1960 Doublecab

Since I may be relocating south to Orlando, I'm starting to decide
which projects I can afford to move and which I need to divest myself
of.  My 1960 Doublecab is still a few years away from my being able to
finish it, so I'm making it availible

The ad is at http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/forsale.html

I have a price in mind, and have had one low-ball offer, but I waiting
for a better offer before I decide whether I need to sell it now or
move it with me.

If you don't have WWW access, email me at rmk_at_sky_dot_net and I'll email
uuencoded gifs of the truck.
