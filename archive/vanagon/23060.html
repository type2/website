Subject: Towing '85 

I propose to tow an '85 camper 700 miles on a tow dolly (a two wheel cart 
- looks like a chariot) behind my '85 Ford truck.

The camper is a 4-speed manual.

I plant to tow it with the rear wheels on the dolly.  That means the 
odometer cable will be turning - or will it?  Does it turn backwards?

Also, need the wheels be locked or should they be free?  Thanks for any 
experiences and suggestions.
