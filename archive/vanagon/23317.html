Subject: Surging at idle

All,

This morning I attempted to start the Thing after letting it sit for a week.
I was tough to start, and it would not idle. When I let off of the gas it
would idle slower,and slower, until it would stall.  After the engine finally
warmed, it would idle, and would occasionally surge. I do not have a tach
so I do not know what it was idling at, but the generator light was not coming
on, or flickering while it was idling. What is going on?

Also, I just got my JC Whipme catalog(I guess they send out their catalogs
with the same regularity that they send out their parts orders). In the general
catalog there were digital gauges. They had 2 sizes of tachometer, a oil
pressure, a oil temp, a water temp, and a speedometer. If I am not mistaken
they all had a point where the light would change from green to yellow, and
then to red. For the tach I believe it was about 7000 rpm where it would turn
red, but the others were not specified. None of them came with senders, so I
wonder if the oil temp gauge would work with a dipstick sender from, say Berg?
I don't see why not. For the tach they had two types of senders, one was
call an inductive sender, it attached to the sparkplug wire and read the
rpm's from that, and the other attached in the regular spot.  Where is that?
I would like to have a tach, but I do not know where to attach it.  One last
thing, is there a VDO catalog, or is there a company that has the full range of
their products in a catalog?  Thanks,
                             David     74 Thing; Wana-bus
