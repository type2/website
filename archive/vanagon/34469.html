Subject: I'm Baaaaack! =)


The new address for ellis is vanbondo_at_primenet_dot_com

Due to unforeseen circumstances Ellis was cut off from the usual madness
last Monday or Tuesday. The corporate types shut down the email due to a
supposed security breech. Until they &quot;figure it out&quot; and config new
firewalls the black hole will remain. (Welcome to the 1970's) Please pass
the carbon paper!

Ellis decided to take himself in hand... er, ah take the SITUATION in hand
and clooge a work-around via primenet. RVB will be changing modes and workin
the net from home. The usual email address may resume from work soon...

Taa Daa! 
See you all on the IRC when i get that ironed out...
