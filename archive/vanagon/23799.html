Hi All-

My sweetie's 71 bus, equipped with pressure-relief-mounted oil temp
sender, recently spun a bearing and got rebuilt (new case, new heads,
etc... nice motor, that we want to take care of).  So here's my
question:

It's running somewhat warm, which I attribute to its newness. Busy
self-machining into perfect harmony and all that, but that means
friction.  Whereas the old motor (same sender, same gauge) ran around
210-230 degrees on the highway, the new one likes to climb up around
250 these days.  It's got ~350-400 miles on it so far.  Should I quit
worrying and expect it to cool off as it gets more broken in?  When
might I expect that?

Timing's good (two hose dist, 5ATDC _at_idle, hoses on), valves are good,
dwell is good, carb seems right but I'm not positive about such things
(new Bocar 34-PICT3, followed Bentley adjusting that).

When is it &quot;fully broken in?&quot;

Thanks for any input,

-Mitch
