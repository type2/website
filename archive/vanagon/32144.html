Subject: Using some list post in Limbo newsletter

To who it may concern,
    I'm writting you to ask if I might be able to use some of the posts I
recieve from the 'Vanagon List' In the LiMBO newsletter.  If you are not
fammilar with LiMBO it is The Late Model Bus Organization, International.
Started in 1988 by Zach Woods, LiMBO is dedicated to the preservation,
restoration and enjoyment of 68-newer buses including Vanagons and
Eurovans.  We publish a bi-monthly newsletter with helpful hints, stories,
tech articals and classifieds.  Current rates are 20 per year. (discount
for anyone on 'the list' who signs up).  If you would like a sample
newsletter and more info please E-mail me at LiMBO's offical E-mail
address: limbo_at_bcn_dot_net, please include you s-nail address.  I haven't quite
figured out how to grab info out of my files and send them electronically.
Coming soon, as soon as Zach can make it, we'll have a home page with lots
of bus stuff.  If this request is OK with you could you please inform new
subcribers to the list and everyone else as well that their submittion
maybe used in our newsletter.  This is a great list and hopefully we can
exchange information back and forth strengthening both of our
Organizations. Thank you very much.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
