Subject: Re: Digest Mode

On 15 Mar 1996, Thomas Zallen &lt;tzallen_at_uniserve_dot_com&gt; asks:
&gt;Can someone out there expalin what &quot;digest mode&quot; is.

It's where you're at when you've eaten a second piece of
pumpkin pie after a thanksgiving meal at grandma's house.


Seriously, it's a way to receive the vanagon newsgroup in
one big email message (one a day), rather than getting it 
one message at a time (every 10 minutes).

To turn digest mode on, send E-Mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu 
with no subject and one line saying
SET VANAGON MAIL DIGEST
