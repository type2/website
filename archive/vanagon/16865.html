&gt;  I don't agree with your friend. Any money you save would be saved now, not
&gt;  later. The fundamental mechanical difference between the 17/1800 and the
&gt;  two liter is crankshaft and connecting rods. A rebuilt two liter costs 
&gt;  a couple hundred more, probably not so much due to content but as to the
&gt;  cost of cores and what the market will bear. As Dave Schwarze pointed out,
&gt;  many 17/1800 owners seek to upgrade to a 2 liter.

Well, I don't plan to return the core, but I still ordered the 2 liter.
Turned out RMMW was a little cheaper on the GEX than GEX themselves, so 
they got my business.

&gt;  Enjoy all that extra torque! If they won't take your core, going with the
&gt;  1800 may be worthwhile if you are tight on cash. I think long term savings
&gt;  will be zip, since the stuff on the outside of the engine is pretty much
&gt;  the same.

Yea, after getting a few more opinions I decided that I can afford it and 
it will be worth it now for the extra power.

So, I have a week till the new engine should arrive, and I'm planning all 
the other things that seem so convenient to do at this point:

remove gas tank to check sending unit.
     (needle goes to F at fillup then to E after ~50 miles)

fix a little rust and clean up engine compartment

I'm sure I'll think of more....
