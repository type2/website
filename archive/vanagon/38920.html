SM&gt;3.) Inflate your front tires to ten pounds less than the max pressure,
SM&gt;which is 12 less than the rears. If that brings the fronts down below
SM&gt;25 psi, set the fronts at 25 psi instead.

This is darn good advice, the '85 I just bought has standard load raters
all round, a couple of Sears 185R14 on front, acouple of Dunlop 185R14
on the back.  First thing I did when I got it was set 27F, 38R.  All are
36psi rated.  Had been set 32 psi all round like you usually get from a
tire shop.  Handling is exceptional compared admittedly to my '78 which
has C load range 195/70R14 all round and handles quite acceptably for
a Bus, as I've driven quite a few Buses with car tires (terryfying when
you
pass a semi, buffeted left, right, left, right, left, right........) 
Frankly if you
think your Vanagon handles badly on car tires drive a Bus for a while,
but
still when it comes time to replace do it right.
