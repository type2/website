well...

this summer i drove from south carolina to oregon, via louisiana,
texas, and lots of little towns in states down south.  i was worried
about it, because if anyone looked the part it could have been me, a
kayak on top, bike on the back, long haired funny looking boy with
even funnier looking glasses, and dead stickers on the windows.  but
although i saw a lot of officers i didn't get pulled over, although
not too many of them would wave back at me.  i've heard some bad
stories from some friends, but haven't had any bad experiences:)

fingers still crossed and a goofy smile on my lips,
						brandy
