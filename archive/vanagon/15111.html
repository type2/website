Subject: '65 Deluxe to TRADE 
Date: Fri, 07 Apr 95 10:02:07 EDT
From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

 A friend of mine has a '65 Deluxe that he wishes to trade for an early
Westfalia, around the '60-'62 age. This is a solid, virtually rust free,
complete, all original, running (very well) 6V bus. If anyone is
interested, or knows of anyone who might be, please call 
Sean Fraser
919-481-3713.
Thank you
