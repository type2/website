Subject: Search for 82 exhaust manifold

Hi all:

 Since putting the 82 Westy in storage for the winter, I have been in digest
mode. Now with the 82 back on the road it's Vanagon time once again. I am
looking for the driver's side exhaust manifold for an 82 aircooled 2.0 litre
engine. This is the second manifold that has broken in two in the same
number of years. I belive it is made of cast iron. The exhaust system is
equipped with an O2 sensor and a cat. The exhaust ports are rectangular. The
exhaust system is California based meaning that the manifold is peculiar
only to those exhaust systems equipped with the sensor and cat. A
passenger's side manifold will not fit. Nor will those from the 49 states or
Canada.

If you have one or know of a place where I can obtain one, please e-mail me
directly. I will pay for shipping.


Thanks - David Carment '82 Westy - Vanagon list member since the summer of ' 94.
