&gt; &gt;My thinking is that the left springs have sagged a bit because of the
&gt; extra &gt;weight.
&gt; &gt;So, what would happen if I got a spring compressor and swapped the
&gt; &gt;springs left to right? The weaker left springs would go on the right.
&gt; Would &gt;this have the result of leveling out the Van?
&gt; &gt;Or is this an exercise in futility?
&gt;
&gt; Please excuse my lack of knowledge.  Is there significant harm in driving
a
&gt; bus with a slight sag?  What are the implications?
