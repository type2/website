If anyone is interested I saw a set of 2 piece gold/silver BBS style =
wheels (14&quot; I think) that fit a 71-91 bus/Vanagon.  They were at Vee =
Parts in Boulder Colorado (313) 444-3991.  I have no affiliation or =
anything with Vee Parts, I just saw the wheels and thought someone might =
want them.  I do not know for sure, but I think the price was $285 for =
the set of 4.  I have a picture of the wheels, currently in the form of =
black and white negatives, but if you want a picture, I'll develop it.
