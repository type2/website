Subject:        2.1L bottom end overhaul

-------------
        It is getting cooler,bass have quit biting so I am planning a complete
overhaul of my 86 2.1L 228K miles,oil presure is low 8-10psi idling and
20-25psi at 2.5K rpm with 15-50 mobil one oil,one cylinder 60 psi others
around 115psi. Any words of wisdom and things to watch out for from the
list would be greatly appreciated.I have overhauled only one other vw,it
was a 78 2.0L air cooled.It is still running well after 30k miles,so maybe
with the help of the list I can get lucky again.tia
