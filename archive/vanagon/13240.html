Subject: (f) Deadhead Definition

Hi all,

I was glancing through my favorite book this morning--Webster's 9th 
Edition Dictionary--and I stumbled across some definitions for 'deadhead'.
I found them interesting:

'one who has not paid for a ticket' (This could relate to the Grateful Dead!)

'a dull or stupid person'  (nothing personal to anyone intended 8-)  )

'to make a return trip without a load' (I guess this could be VW-related)

Just a thought for the day I guess.  8-)
