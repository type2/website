Subject:       Re: '56 kombi - brakes (again)

&gt; I guess I _really_ should replace the steel like that goes front to
&gt; back, but its such a distasteful chore...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone done this before?

Thom,

Just wanted to drop you a note.  I checked out your bus photos on 
Schwarze's page.  You've done a fabulous job!  I don't know if you 
remember, but I am in the midst of restoring my '57, and I was 
curious.  Did '56 originally have the center brake light.  I know my 
'57 doesn't.  (Just the two teeny brake ligthts)  

Your paint job looks great.  Have you the bumpers for it??  I am 
having a very difficult time finding some.  (For now I painted the 
early 60's ones I have ceiling wax red, and threw on the chrome that 
I have for them.)  Maybe one day when I get $1k for bumpers and 
chrome I'll do it! &lt;grin&gt;.

Coincidentally, last night I was under the bus replacing brake lines. 
I had to do the two front rubber ones, and the metal ones, as I 
snapped one off.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the brakes 
are much better, but alas, I will have to adjust the stars 
tonight, as the thing is still pulling very hard to the right.
Good luck on the long brake line &lt;ACK!&gt;

So basically this message didn't help out at all! &lt;haha!&gt;
