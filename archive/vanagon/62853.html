I have it in book form. This is from previous posts:

I ordered it from VW Heritage Parts Centre, Unit 5, Freeman's Road,
Portslade, Sussex BN41 1SL, UK. Tel: (0044) 1273 424330. It was GB#4 plus
postage plus VAT.

It has over 160 pages (on the last page it even shows the little bag
containing the jack, wheel wrench and a couple of hand tools). I have not
quite worked out the system but I think you quote the page number and then
the part number which is arrowed on each part on the page.

I think it is the same thing that the VW main dealers have on microfiche
when you go into the parts centre.

It is called:

VW Genuine Parts Illustrated Catalogue

In the catalogue it lists the vehicle ranges that other books cover, and
the list seems fairly comprehensive. Under 'Commercial Vehicles' it lists:

Typ/Mod                  Order No
Typ 2 Mod. 68 -&gt; 79      000.7340.82.89
Typ 2 Mod. 80 -&gt; 85      000.7340.74.89
Typ 2 Mod. 86 -&gt; 87      000.7340.64.89
Typ 2 Mod. 88 -&gt;         000.7340.92.89
Typ 2 Syncro             000.7340.57.89

It does not list the new Caravelle 1991 onwards (aka EV in USA), but my
catalogue is dated 1994.

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if VW sells their parts list for any of their cars on
&gt; microfiche?  And if they do what dose something like this would cost?  I
&gt; know that wiring diagrams, tech bulletins, and manuals are available
&gt; through their product service publications.
