We have a 1988 Vanagon for sale in Michigan.  It has 102,000 miles.
It is navy with grey interior and has the weekender package with rear
facing seats and 
fold down table.  Automatic transmission.  New exhaust, brakes, rear hatch
struts
and recent head gaskets and seals.  Don't want to part with it and love it
but we must sell as son is going to college. Want to find a loving home at
