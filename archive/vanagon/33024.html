Subject: Re: Idiot factor (was: Not overheating -SMAHER)

&gt;&gt;The idiot factor arises when you do something which you ought not to
&gt;&gt;do because you know better.
&gt;&gt;
1. Do you remember my tale of going to the trouble of R&amp;Ring the alternator
and the impellar fan due to a &quot;bearing noise&quot; only to find out later that
the header was banging on the rear apron? =)

2. Over torquing the oiler cooler case stud/nut &lt;snap!&gt; late on a Sunday
night and needing vehicle the following day.

3. Trying to get the 36hp to run right for a week and a half without
success. Suffered ridcule by the neighbors over your &quot;mechanical aptitude.&quot;
Having the mechanic fix it in 30 seconds due to the switched 1 and 2 plug
wires.  I double checked them a zillion times even though I *KNEW* they were
right and even tracked them and checked Muir. It was the first thing I
checked! Blamed it on the 36hp plug wire loom tube. Un-huh...
