Kelly, 
You have a pefectly good gear cover already in your van.  It is very
simple, put your goodies UNDER the rear deck cushion.   Try to make it a
level as possible so it looks normal.  No special racks, hangers or
covers needed. Let's not reinvent to wheel.

&gt; I use the clothes closet.  It isn't always convenient since it has a very
&gt; narrow opening but it gets a briefcase or purse out of sight.  I would
&gt; welcome a better option but without too much fuss.
