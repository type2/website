Ok, so I'm an idiot and I don't have a clue what &quot;retarding the timing&quot; 
means -- they're all just buzzwords, right?  Sigh.
I finally got out the manual and figured out which was was really 
&quot;retarding&quot; and then I set it to about 2 degrees BTDC (spec is 5 degress 
ATDC) It runs a little smoother, but not nice. I'm going to have to get a 
decent diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure my initial diagnosis is right.  I 
also think I need a new engine or a total rebuild. It's only a matter of 
time. Especially since I can't really drive it to the ground because of 
the emissions stuff.
