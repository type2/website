&gt;Does anyone know if all 1990 Vanagons imported into the U.S. were California
&gt;emissions compliant?  I'm thinking of gettting a 1990 syncro in vermont and
&gt;it just occurred to me that I might not be able to drive it at home.

i think the separate california models were done away with back about 1983
... that is, all vanagons imported into the u.s. were &quot;california&quot; models
after then. i'm fairly sure that all the 83-85 were, and even more sure that
1986-1991 were all the same. however, make sure it's NOT a canadian model
... that might cause some problems, fer sure.
