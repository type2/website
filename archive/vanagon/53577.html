Yes but in a baywindow Westy.  It was my Dad's actually and he committed 
the possible sin of putting eye bolts into the fiberglass, 2 up front and 
2 in the back and another pair each in the front bumpers.  Eventually 
this became a pair of handmade wood racks attached to the eyebolts on top 
for a pair of canoes.  The very most important part we found was the ties 
down to the bumpers.  Wind would get up under the canoe and try to lift 
those puppies up.  The eye bolts through the fiber glass never caused any 
problems in the decade we had that bus.  Might still be driving around 
with them in SW Virginia somewhere.
