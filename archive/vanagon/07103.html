Subject: Product Review&gt;T4 Keyless E

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

'Just got done putting in the Autobahn keyless entry system for the EV
(PJ, that would be a Transporter for you ;)  ).

It basically requires the removal of the glovebox (7 phillips head screws
and an 8mm hex head screw) and the ability to read.

The instructions are pretty clear, with the exception of two minor errors
that didn't really slow things down much.  All wires are pre-terminated
and there is no soldering/splicing/crimping to be done anywhere.  This is
as clean as a factory installed job.

Features:  Allows user to remotely unlock/lock vehicle from up to ~50 yds.
away.  Interior lights (all of 'em) that are set to trigger with door(s)
open will light and stay on for ~1 minute or until ignition is turned on
or the key fob is depressed to lock the doors.  In addition, the doors will
automagically lock when the ignition is turned on, and unlock when the ig-
nition is turned off.

VWUS part #ZVW 288 220   (ZVW 288 110 for 93 and up A3 Golf, Jetta, Passat
and Corrados)

Cost: ~US$150 + tax from Timmons VW in Long Beach, CA

Add'l reference: 7/94 european car mag. pps. 36,92-93
