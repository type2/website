Subject: Rain Gutter Adapter Locations

I have seen many posts about the Yakima and Thule &quot;gutter&quot; adapters for the
Westy Roof. Is there a best location for them? Will be caring canoe. Also
in Augusta last summer, I saw a late Westy with tall towers attached to the
rain gutters that were made of small dia tube steel, bent in form of &quot;A&quot;,
black finish, not cast or milled. Anyone else seen these?
