Subject: Re: First breaker-bar of the summer!!!

I'm lucky that we have a 3/4&quot; drive ratchet, it whieghts like 15-20 pounds
and scares
those nuts off any old bus.  With a 6 foot lenght of aluminum army tent
pipe, my little self can tourque on and off to 250 lb specs.

If you can't afford one of these just get a crasfman bar and try your
hardest to break it
weekly.




&gt;&gt;I got up, the socket was still sitting on the axle nut as though this
&gt;entire event &gt;hadn't occurred.  Looking around, I retrieved the breaker-bar
&gt;from under the
&gt;&gt;bus... Yes Volks, the driver nib was still in the socket...sheared
&gt;&gt;clean off as though someone had cut it.  Determined not to let this
&gt;&gt;little set back ruin an otherwise &quot;good&quot; day, I immediately found an
&gt;&gt;optimistic angle to the situation: &quot;Hey, not everyone has sheared off
&gt;&gt;a 3/4&quot; drive breaker-bar...especially without using a length of pipe.&quot;
