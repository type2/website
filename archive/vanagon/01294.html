Subject: Re: vanagon st. wheel angle

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm about to acquire the '81 camper I've been having some
&gt;refurbishing work done on.  Am looking forward to it in every
&gt;way EXCEPT one:  the damned arcane angle of the steering wheel.
&gt;People tell me I'll get used to it, but I'm curious to hear from
&gt;other vanagon owners on this matter.  
&gt;
&gt;Further, has anyone out there figured out a way to retrofit
&gt;another wheel, or alter the angle of the existing one?  If
&gt;so, would be curious how...

Oh, for shame Martha...  Please don't take this the wrong way
but the driving position in the bus is one of the things that I
appreciate the most:  Sitting straight up in true teutonic fashion.
It, believe it or not, is one of the most comfortable positions
for extended travel.  I took the bus on a 500 mile run and felt
great afterwards while taking a 75 mile run with an '84 Honda
made my back feel like spasming clumps of jello.  You *will*
get used to it and then wonder why you ever considered changing 
the set up.  At the very least try it out for a while.  Please?
