Subject: 1600 in a 73 - round 2
Date: Tue, 2 Jan 1996 14:50:55 -0800 (PST)

hi every one,

well my origonal question was &quot;is it possible to put a 1600 engine in
a 1973 bus&quot;.  almost everyone said yes.  here's the gotcha's:

1)  need to make an engine tin / compartment seals.  anyone want to
    speculate how difficult this would be for someone doing it at home
    beside the house?  (maybe a garage by then)

2)  modifying the rear engine mount?  a '73 uses a different support
    than the 71.  again, how hard?  it was suggested that a '71 rear
    mount might fit?  i will have to check and see how that whole
    mount thing works.

3)  the bus would be slower.  not really a big surprise.

well, i do believe that i will be thinking about this in the back of
my head.  speed isn't really an issue, but being able to work on the
engine cheaply (comparatively) and the availability of parts seems
like a good thing.  bob mentioned the ease of increasing the
displacement of the engine.  ok, here's my terrible question of the
day....  

	a higher displacement results in more power?  what else?

take care all,
	brandy
