Subject: '83.5 wasserboxer idling strange
Date: Tue, 12 Nov 1996 10:04:44 -0500

Good morning!

Well, along with the cold weather comes strange behavior from the bus! The
problem isn't serious at all yet, just curious and would like to prevent
any problems.

As the subject says, my bus is idling strange, whether warm or cold. It's
almost like you lightly touch the gas pedal every second or so. The
rev/idle is very consistent and rhythmic. It doesn't seem to effect the
drivability at all and doesn't stall when idling for extended periods, say
10 minutes.

Any advice/comments?

Thanks!

tony
