&gt; I have not worked
&gt;on a FI bus engine so I don't know how hard this is, but I'm sure it's
&gt;not easy.

Check the with Bentley, its easier than you think....  Of course an 85
wasserboxer (of which I am familiar) has no tin. (We don't need no stinkin
tin) so the FI assembly just comes off as an entire unit in about 20 minutes.
 Head accessable.

(I wonder if one of those ALLDATA CDs have tips like this in it?)  Thom?!
