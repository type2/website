Subject: Leaky windshield

Hi Y'all,

I have an 84 Vanagon with a leaky windshield,  I knew it had a leak
but did not realize how bad it was until I washed the Van the other
day and the radio got wet.  


Any quick remedies?

I know this has been asked before, but I did not realize I had
a significant problem, so I did not pay attention.
