Subject: engine cover mattress; Thing rescue


Does anyone in Alaska or North Carolina know where I can salvage an 
engine cover mattress to add to my '87 Syncro GL?  Camper size (to 
accomodate the cabinets) or full size is fine.  I'll be headed south next 
week, and could bring one back with me.  

I get to visit with my '74 Thing, which 
has been weathering hurricaines under my mom's house for 5 years now.  It 
ran (weakly) when I parked it; what are the first things I should try in 
order to resurrect it?

Thanks,
