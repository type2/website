Subject: 92 Westy interior parts

Hi listies,

I was making a watercooled transaction (rabbit parts) yesterday with a local
waternut and he mentioned a friend of his (I believe in New Hampshire) has a
92 Westy(ie) he's parting out.  I think the guy is in the business of
parting out watercooled VWs so he might have other van stuff if you're in
the New Hampshire area:

Herk Enterprises
(603) 887-3118

Apparently the camper was in a rollover type accident so the body is shot,
but the interior is supposed to be all there.

That's all I know (about this topic anyway),
