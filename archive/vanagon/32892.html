Saw an ad in a local circular for a 1971 Sun Dial bus... what is it? A kind
of conversion other than Westfalia? Any opinions on comparative features?
They wanted about $1600 for the bus. THANKS!

Sun Dial is an outfit that put together vw campers.  Ive seen more splitties
Sun Dials than later ones.  The set up is the same as a westy  SO42 kit  that
is the most common, but the cabinets etc are not as sturdy.  They are
finished wood, however, and have brass handles, which is attractive.  I dont
care much for the fake wood formica on the westy cabinets, though it is
practical.
