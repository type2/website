Subject: Carb-jet reaming (was 009/34-pict flat spot)


I would be very interested in hearing the results of the HotVW's carb-jet 
reaming experiment (wasn't a similar solution mentioned by Muir?).  
Please post your experiences.  

BACKGROUND:  The local FLARS said (paraphrasing) &quot;That 
Muir had some crazy ideas.  Sure we'll do it, but will the results be 
what you wanted?&quot;  Well, I didn't know, so I didn't have it done.  But 
there's always that curiosity...Or should I say IDLE CURIOSITY?  (yuk, yuk)
