Subject: COLLAPSING WES



 &gt; From: smitht_at_jupiter.sun.csd.unb_dot_ca (Tim Smith)

&gt; got my 83 westy from a buddy who got a job as a VP overseas so had to quit
&gt;all his cars and move out. He gave me a large cloth bag and said it's a
V&gt; camping
&gt;tent inside. I have never had a chance to open it up and see what it is yet.
&gt;Now all the messages on this net wanting a westy tent has gotten me curious.
&gt;So what is a westy tent? I am going to go home to find out if I got one too.

 I don't know
 &gt; if a vanagon tent was available, I've never seen one, just the old style bus 
 &gt; version, which just barely mates to a Vanagon.   tim s.

Wow. There's a question. Was there ever a camping tent for Vanagons ala 60's
campmobiles?

Happy to Be Back!

Jackson
