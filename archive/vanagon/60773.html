Subject: EV RECALL INFO?

HI 
Any one know what the recall code SN means?
My EV was checked for it and the Injector wires were rerouted or 
something...but when the mech fisrt mentioned(on The Phone) that I was 
to bring my 97 ev in for Recall SN he mentiond something about the 
antenna would have to be replaced as well however this was not done I am 
wondering if It was too much of a pain for hime or was he Mistaken the 
first time
Tahnks
