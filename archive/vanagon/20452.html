Subject: FS 82 Westy Deluxe

        I am sending this for a bus club member here in Chattanooga.  I 
        have not driven the vehicle but it looks really good. I did go 
        over the body, poptop, stove/refrig etc.  All of those things are 
        in excellent condition.  The details are as follows.
        
        &quot;1982 Westphalia Deluxe.  Diesel engine rebuilt at 90,000; 
        129,000 total miles.  All accessories work; van is immaculately 
        clean and well cared for.  $3200.&quot;
        
        The vehicle belongs to Ric Arnold, food service director at 
        Baylor School.  If you're interested reply to me and I'll forward 
        his number/address.
