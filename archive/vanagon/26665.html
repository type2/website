&gt;&gt;I have the address (thanks to Joel) for Zemco but it's not a brand my

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyone out there successful with SCS/Frigate vacuum cruise in their
vanagon?
&gt;
I haven't had experience with the SCS but here's my Zemco experience:
I've used their model where the controls are mounted in a little rectangular
box - not the stalk mount controls.  This box fits perfectly on the plastic
cover between the back of the steering wheel and the front of the gauges.  I
haven't seen this style pictured in J.C.Whitney lately, so I don't know if
they still make it.

1. 84 Rabbit GTI, manual trans - worked great, no problem
2. 82 Rabbit Pickup, Diesel, manual trans - originally had a hole in the
vacuum diaphragm.  Zemco promptly replaced it - worked great, no further
problems.
3. 87 Vanagon Syncro, manual trans - works great, no problem
4. 87 Vanagon, auto trans - usually works fine but occasionally cuts out for
no apparent reason - still usable, haven't bothered to figure out what the
problem is.
