Subject: Re: Convincing my wife...

&gt;IGNORE those other posts which advise buying the bug and asking forgiveness
&gt;later.  This is a VERY bad thing.  Honesty is the basis of ANY good
&gt;relationship.  DON'T risk upseting your wife with this new acquisition.
&gt;
        I have to say that I agree with this concept. If I pulled that
stunt Samantha would have me for breakfast...   &amp; I'd be in the doghouse
for a good period of time-perhaps until I got rid of the offending vehicle.
If she doesn't agree at first, keep at her. Maybe this deal won't go down,
but with time I've convinced Sam that we need a splittie, so now all I have
to do is find one (and some cash) and I can buy it with her blessing!!
Whoopee!!!  Of course, Texas is not exactly the home of the profuse
splitties...

Peace,
