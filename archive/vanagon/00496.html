&gt; I have one of those acoustic couplers that are supposed to work with pay

&gt; the net!

James here's one for you... AX.25... That's amateur radio packet.  
There are gateways around the country that allow you to 
access internet. So Big Sir ins't out of the question. How about BORA-
BORA... Katmandue.  The south pole?  Well maybe not in your Westie!

If you want more info send me a personal msg. I'll give you the low 
down on HAM RADIO...
