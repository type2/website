Subject: Flywheel problems!
Date: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 00:01:54 +1100 (EST)

Found out the problem is my flywheel is coming loose.  The motor has been
out three time to fix it.  The dowles (spelling) seem to be moving, causing
the flywheel (and the spots where the dowles are) to elongate.  Can anyone
fill me in on what the hell is happening.  The motor is great.  Could it be
the crank??

Any constructive anwers would be greatly appreciated.  I want to keep my
bus, but tempers are flying.  :-)

Thanks

tracey
