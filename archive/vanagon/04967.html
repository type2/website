I would recommend the Wagon Shop in Bellevue.  I had my 82 Diesel rebuilt 
by them.  They are friendly and knowledgeable, like to talk about vw's--when 
they aren't too busy. Daryl (sp?) was the one that did my work.

                          
                               Later,
                                    Brad
