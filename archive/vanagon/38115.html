Subject: Update on Easter PA Camping Trip
Date: Thu, 21 Mar 96 19:02:54 -0500
From: Dave Mancuso &lt;dlm202_at_psu_dot_edu&gt;

Hi Folks,
Sorry for the late update--I've been away for a conference and just got 
back.

We've gotten some good response for the camping trip to French Creek 
State Park. (about 10 people/vans/families interested so far). I'll get 
some more information to all of you and any others who are interested 
tomorrow.

There's only one potential problem: The east coast Bug Out. As we see on 
the list, it seems to be the same weekend as our trip, April 19, 20, and 
21.

How does the following weekend look to everyone? (April 26, 27, and 28)? 
Personally, either weekend is good for me. Also, anyone on the list 
interested in this new weekend?

Whichever weekend it is, I will most likely get there Friday around 7 or 
so. This is a state park, and sites are $10 per night for PA residents 
and $12 per night for non-PA residents. Sites are first come, first 
serve, but I'll try to get us all in one place when I get there.

They have hiking and various other activities around (I think an old iron 
forge is around there, too). Again, I'll get you specifics when I call 
them tomorrow.

They have showers, I believe, but I doubt that they're hot.

Let me know which weekend is good for you.

Thanks!
Dave
