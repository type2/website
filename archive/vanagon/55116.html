Larry wrote, that the URL is not longer in
service. I tried his alternative and it
works.

For used Campers try the link

'REIMO-Reisemobilcenter'

and in this page

'Gebrauchtwagen'

This site seems to be under construction. I
got a Transfer Interruption and I can't find
the link to the EV any more. Therefore the
pictures for Mercedes are correct. I have to
watch it or will do a FTP to my own server.

Thanks to Larry!
