&gt; but it *did* start to happen pretty soon 
&gt;(but not immediately...) after I cleaned the Panamint dust out of my

&gt;by a correspondent, of unplugging the distributor and covering it 
&gt;with a plastic bag, but otherwise pretty much sprayed all around.) 
&gt;
&gt;According to my reading of Bentley, this surge/lag is the same affect 
&gt;that I should see if the throttle switch gap is too big (ie, &gt; 
&gt;.01mm). However, I can't see how moisture in the engine compartment 
&gt;could have affected this clearance. Unplugging, cleaning and 
&gt;reseating the connector between the throttle valve switch and the ECU 
&gt;(done at midnight under a streetlamp...) *seemed* to help for awhile, 
&gt;but the effect eventually returned.

I don't think the moisture caused your problem.  The switch is incredible
simple and I don't think it could be harmed by a little water.  The function
of the switch is to signal the Digifant brain when there is a no-throttle or
full-throttle condition.  At no-throttle, the idle stabilazation is engaged.
 At full-throttle the Digifant richens the mixture.  I don't see how either
of these conditions (if they were engaged at the wrong time) could cause the
symptoms you describe.  I don't have a good suggestion on where the problem
lies, but my inclination is that the switch is not it.

&gt;Is it possible that I've toasted my throttle valve switch?  Water in 
&gt;there somewhere making intermittent contact?  How expensive are these 
&gt;parts?  Of course, Bentley makes disassembly look easy but in reality 
&gt;it's wedged beneath manifolds, my (non-functioning) cruise control 
&gt;stuff, etc.:-P  Also, I believe I'd have to do a idle recalibration 
&gt;after reassembly, no?

I've adjusted my switch a couple times and have not done any idle
calibration.  I do not believe it is required.

Good Luck,
