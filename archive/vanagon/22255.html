Subject: Bob Hoover's Sermons

Several folks still on the vintagvw mailing list started asking about
Bob Hoover's (Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com) sermons, so I started a compilation on my
WWW Home Pages.  If you are WWW equipped, check out

http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/			For Netscape 1.1

http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/notmozilla.html 	for all other viewers.

I will try and keep this updated with Bob's postings, as they add to the
volume of Air-Cooled VW practical experience.

If you have postings from Bob that I have missed, please send them to me
at rmk_at_sky_dot_net and I will add them.
