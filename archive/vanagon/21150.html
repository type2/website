Subject: Re: Vases for the Dash on Bus?

&gt;Has anyone on the list ever heard of a flower vase that originally came
&gt;with VW buses (set on the dash)? What would originals be worth? My nephew
&gt;swears there was such a thing, but I've never heard of it.

I've seen bud vases in bugs.  Does anyone know of a good source for auto bud
vases?  I've seen cheezy ceramic ones, but I'd like crystal.
