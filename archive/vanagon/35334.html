Subject: Re: Type II Manual and Literature Database (LONG)

Okay!  Paul Retherford contacted me about including the list of manuals on
his WWW page, so I won't need to clog up your mailboxes anymore!  The URL
is listed in Paul's message below, and I'll contact Paul with updates as
they occur.  Great job Paul, and thanks a lot.  I believe there's a slight
correction of the URL (for Netscape, at least) for FTPing the file:

ftp://ftp.infocom_dot_com/pub/staff/paulr/manuals.txt

Thanks again, Paul.

&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;It's up on my (just created) VW Bus Page and on our ftp server.
&gt;Take a look and see what you think.  I'll probably convert it to HTML 
&gt;in the near future with mailto: URL's to list members, etc.
&gt;
&gt;http://www.infocom_dot_com/~paulr/vw
&gt;ftp.infocom_dot_com:/pub/staff/paulr/manuals.txt
&gt;
&gt;If it looks OK let me know and/or CC the list with the URL.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Paul
