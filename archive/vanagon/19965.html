Bill,

This is very interesting.  I had assumed the Mexican vans had a more 
upright engine.  I too wonder if it's the same set up as the diesel 
Vanagon.  

On the Diesel van, the two upper engine bolts (nearest the head) are at 
1:00 and about 2:30 as you look at them from the tranmission side.  The 
starter is at about 12:00, which is bracketed by bolts at 11:30 and 
1:00.  Part number on my diesel sump is 068 103 603A.  I could send you 
a picture of the Vanagon diesel setup, to take on your next Mexico trip, 
if you want.

How are the motor mounts set up on the Mex. Caravelle?
