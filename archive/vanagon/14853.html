&gt; as a healthy, red blooded, hormonally laden twenty year-old i had to try
&gt; and max out my bus the other day.  got to an indicated speed of
&gt; ninety-five {yeah- 95} mph before i decided that i really didn't want to
&gt; pay for _another_ rebuild [and those trees didn't look too inviting
&gt; anyway].  i know, i know, why drive any car that fast, let alone a
&gt; bredloaf...sometimes one has to be stupid (i normally drive 60-64). so
&gt; here's the question...why is everybody else to pleased to be going seventy??
&gt; i had a bunch of pedal left....
&gt; (100mph?  not for me thanks!)

Heh, I tried that once too.  I got Da Boat up to 90 going down a huge
hill before I realized that, based on the fact that the pitch of my motor
had risen to a point where only a dog could hear it, I must be turning
over 5,000 RPM which is a no-no without a counterweighted crank, and I
backed off.  Just wanted to peg the speedo so I could say, &quot;I pegged the
speedo!&quot;.  You get the idea.
