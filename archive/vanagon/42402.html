Subject: Intermittent rough running Waterboxer

I have a waterboxer engine that runs rough intermittently.  I wonder if 
anyone has run across this problem before.  It appears primarily on 
deceleration, as a bucking sensation.  It does not appear to exhibit the 
same symptoms that people have noted are cured with the P/N 025-906-302 
harness, although I haven't ruled that out.

Not much to go on at this point.  I have changed the fuel filter - no 
noticable change.  Distributor cap, rotor, and plugs all appear fine 
(about 30,000 miles on them).  Will replace them regardless.  I 
had the catalytic converter off several months ago and it appeared in tack.

Suggestions welcome and appreciated.

Fred
