Subject: Re: Vanagon motor swap???

&gt;I'd opt for solution #1.  The engines should be directly interchangeable
&gt;although VW has made some minor improvements along the way.  Use the 1990
&gt;Brain Box (Digifant Control Unit) VW has made several improvements in this
&gt;unitt and it's program.  I don't think they've changed the model number but I
&gt;reclaa they've used different color stickers to distinguish one revision from
&gt;the other.

My mechanic showed me a catalog from a company called Kennedy Engineered
Products, they offer a engine-transmission &quot;peice&quot; (i cant think of the
proper word now) it adapts a Chevy V-6 to a vanagon transmission.  the
company has ads in hot vw's, i am very curious as to everything about this
swap, would more cooling be needed? would everything fit? fuel injected or
carburated?  i plan to do this after my engine dies.
