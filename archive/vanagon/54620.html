Subject: Re: Mystery dash outlet '83.5 GL Westy


Are you nuts to pay 12 USD for a plug which fits this awful socket in
your Westy? I would pay a quarter of this amount for that plug. And,
maybe except USA, this plug is not a Hella only item.

But I'm not lucky with this plugs. I always mounted Banana sockets into
my cars to run aux. equipment. Of cause, someone may do the mistake to
plug into wrong direction but they have good connections even to
drive the CB radio. Bananas are cheap and everywhere to use.

&gt;This
&gt;is a HELLA only item. The HELLA plugs are still available, and they are $12 
each.
&gt;You can wire the HELLA plug into any 12v accessory that you would be able 
to
&gt;run off a conventional cigarette lighter .
&gt;
&gt;thanks for reminding me - I need to order a couple too.
