Subject: Re: Late beetle muffler

...I dono about the California cars, but the described muffler
was also used on the (maybe Europe only) AR engine, it's a 1285cc
44 DIN Hp (32Kw) engine used from 8/'73 to 7/'75. It was used mostly
in Bugs but in Italy (where the roadtax system is based on power or
displacement or something) you could also order a 1300 in your Bus.
It came with a 31 PICT Solex i believe, but certainly not FI. And
no emmision control in those days in Europe, that only started
somewhere in the 80s i guess...
