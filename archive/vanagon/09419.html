Subject: Re: Wanted! 1600cc Vanagon Engine Case- REALLY!
Date: Fri, 6 Jan 95 9:26:16 PST

&gt; 
&gt; 	To build a UNIQUE engine for my '69 Beetle! 
&gt; 	(No, NOT for my '88 Wasserboxer! I'm crazy, not stupid!)
&gt; 
&gt; 	These cases have *cast-in provision* for full-flow oil filters! 
&gt; Yeah, yeah, I KNOW there's all kinds of other ways to add full-flow 
&gt; filters to the Type I/II/III engine, but this would be UNIQUE and WAY 
&gt; COOL, in my opinion.
&gt; 
  Ian, I am aware of these cases too, but before you hurry off and get one
  for your bug, make sure that the flywheel end of the engine will fit. As
  far as I know that engine was used *only* in the Vanagon and may be
  configured to bolt up to the 091 gearbox with a 228mm clutch like a 
  wasserboxer.
  Looking in Haynes (A copy of which I wish I had, but don't) should clear
  this up.

  Also, does anyone know if those 1600cc Vanagon cases are made of Aluminum
  or Magnesium?
