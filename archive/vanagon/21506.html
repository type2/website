Subject: Outta here

I finally came to the realization that I_must_ unsub for a while.
We're trying to close a house deal, and the calls from realtor and 
mortgage company are cutting into the &quot;personal&quot; time usually spent 
reading this list. :(

Besides that we've got an auditor in the department this week, so who 
knows how much time I'll have anyhoo.

I'll miss all the info here but I'll try to hit the Web page now and again.
When I come back &lt;fingers crossed&gt; I'll have new addresses, snail, 
hopefully, and e- as this connection gets flakier by the day.

Joel, I'll let ya know when, where and what, whenever.

Bye for now.
