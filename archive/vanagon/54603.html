Subject: Noah - New Animal Search Engine!

Dear Animal Lover,

I am excited to announce the debut of Noah, a search engine dedicated only
to quality animal sites on the web!

Noah has less than 100 entries right now and that is why I am writing to
you for your help.  If you have an animal-related web site, or know of a
few good ones, please submit it using the submit link on the Noah page.  We
want to build Noah up a lot more before we announce it to the general
public.  Your help is appreciated!!

Even if you don't have a site to submit, feel free to visit us at
http://www.cyberark_dot_com and try Noah out.  Your comments and suggestions
are highly appreciated while we are in this formation stage.

Thank you for your time!

Sincerely,



*Sierra*
