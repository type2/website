Subject: Re: Steering Locks

(A steering lock story)

The steering lock can be a real headache if you lose your key- on my 71
Westie, I was at the shore with 3 kids when the key was lost at the beach 4
hrs from home- removed entire steering column, sawed off the ignition and
lock, bypassed (+) current to coil and laid underneath to spin starter with
piece of wire- Got home fine, and put in momentary switch for starter and
flip switch for ignition, and drove it that way for another 80K mi or so!!!
The irony is that I left name with concession stand and got call next day
that a VW key was found which turned out to be mine! **
