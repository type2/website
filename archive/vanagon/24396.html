Subject: RE: The '71 single cab that isn't

I happen to have an old copy of Foreign Car Digest which includes an article
regarding the installation of a Corvair engine into a bus. The magazine is
guaranteed to be '60-'65. Those are the only years that I have of this pub.
I will look tonight and see if it reveals some insight. Hold your thumbs
until then.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;At this point, I'm thinking. This is actually the second week it's
&gt;&gt;been in the paper; he didn't think it would be selling soon. I'll
&gt;&gt;prolly take a look and then pass on it (and pass his # on), I dunno.
&gt;&gt;Apparently it's got the bus tranny, but with the ring gear flipped to
&gt;&gt;make it go backwards for the corvair engine.  Any feedback on how hard
&gt;&gt;that would be to undo?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I had the impression that there are only two reasons someone would
&gt;reverse the ring gear in a VW tranny (my knowledge on this is sufficient
&gt;only to be dangerous, please correct me if I'm wrong):
&gt;
&gt;1.) If someone is putting a swingaxle bus tranny in a swingaxle bug,
&gt;which doesn't use the bus reduction gears at the wheels;
&gt;
&gt;2.) If someone is building a midengine car with the engine in front of
&gt;the rear axle and turned around.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Doesn't the Corvair engine rotate the same direction as a VW engine,
&gt;i.e. clockwise as seen from behind the car? If so, this single cab
&gt;probably doesn't have the ring gear flipped.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have more complete knowledge on this (wouldn't be hard!)?
&gt;It would be nice to get a definite word on this, from someone who's been
&gt;there and done it.
