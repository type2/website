Subject: '75 Westy Camper Parts Van

A local (NW Arkansas) VW rebuilder/stocker of parts/junker has a '75 Westy
Camper with stove, sink, etc. Looks like a really nice setup, though few of
the parts convert over to my '71. I just thought I'd mention it in case
someone here has need of said parts. Has motor and tranny, though it's
missing the steering wheel and a few misc parts. Side door's also off and
laying inside bus, so it's getting some weather. He offered to sell me the
whole thing for $300...though he'd probably go lower...but like I said, I
don't need it. What I'd really like to find is a $200 '71 beyond hope that
I could canabalize for a parts cache (please, no flames...you know you'd
all like to have a garage full of parts...and some of you do). If you're in
need of '75 camper parts, this might be the one....actually, if the layout
wasn't sooo different, I'd probably look at some of these for a possible
mod to mine (which doesn't have as nice an interior as this one does)..
anyone ever upgrade an older campmobile to newer interior?

E-mail direct for contact info on this one.

Thanks, Joe Fournier, '71 Campmobile
