&gt; and weld it back in?  Weld in a tube of similar 
&gt; dimensions/characteristics?  Put in a hose?

I used 1 1/4 inch heater hose to replace two of my steel tubes.  Double 
clamping the hose helps prevent it from slipping off the pipe, if the 
ends of the pipe are not flared.  This was on a '82 diesel.

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any idea what they cost from the factory?

The steel pipes are no longer available, at least for the diesels.  A.J.
at Wes Lasher VW in Sacramento estimated $350 to convert to the new
plastic pipes.  I think the kit included larger diameter plastic pipes and
new rubber hoses to adapt their ends.
