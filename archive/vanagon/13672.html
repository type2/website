Subject: Re: 23 Window prices


&gt;The talk of prices for 23 window splits in the States has me *absolutely*
&gt;salivating.  Can you in fact, pick up a 23 window for less than $1000 US?  I
&gt;wouldn't care if it was engineless/transmission less - it is the bodies which
&gt;are hardest to come by in AUS.  The majority of early vans imported into this
&gt;country were Standard models.

Sometimes you can find 23 window models for under $1000, but you'd better
believe that you're getting what you paid for.  Not only would it be engine
less and tranny less but it'll probably have no interior and be rusty.  So
good luck in your hunt.
