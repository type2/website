 John,
 Are you sure that all of these problems are related to the head gaskets?
 Head gaskets can leak externally, internally, or both.  What you saw was an 
 external leak (although there may also be an internal leak).  A mechanic 
 can run a test to see if your oil and antifreeze are mixing (indicating an 
 internal leak) - although I understand that this test is not 100% accurate 
 (but close). It's always possible that your head gaskets are only leaking 
 externally, and the lack of power, etc. are not related to the head gasket 
 leak but are a symptom of a different problem.  
 If you do need head gaskets kits, I have them for $135 for the pair 
 (German) if you can't find a comparable price locally.
 Good luck (I've been there...:(

The engine ran fine up to that point except I was getting poor gas mileage.
 About 14-15 around town.  I was working on fuel injection for that.  I just
ran some Fuel Injector cleaner through.  Otherwise it ran great.

Parts Place has Cylinder Head gaskets for $29.95 a piece.  Their dealer price
is claimed to be $62.35.  My mechanic claims he gets a full set, with special
sealant &amp; etc. (I don't know what &amp; etc. is) for $400 from a company in New
Jersey.

I'll be reading the archives &amp; etc.  It seems this is a meticulous procedure
especially if heads are pitted.

What's the wisdom on gasket, preparation, and sealant materials?
