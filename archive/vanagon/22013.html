Subject: Re: Philly Area Gathering #2????

I'm interested! Keep me posted.
Wish me luck on my 1000 mile trip to FL this week (today, acutally--just
missed Hurricane Aaron!).

PS Love the pictures! (BTW, Kevin is Kevin Corcoran--he has an '85
Weekender, looking for a full camper if the price is right.)
 No Ric, he can't afford a Eurovan    :-)

&gt;
&gt;Any of the &quot;Phirst Philly Crew&quot; and/or the rest the Northeast
&gt;Contingent of the Vanagon list interested in perhaps having a
&gt;gathering at the Woodstock VW Reunion this Sept 9 &amp; 10?
&gt;
&gt;There are a couple of other possibilities...
&gt;
&gt;Aug 27 - Ct Bug-A-Fair 4 - Terryville CT...as the listing in the
&gt;Comming Events section of the LiMBO TRANSPORTER said &quot;a big
&gt;show that needs more busses&quot;...
&gt;
&gt;Sept 30 - Transporterfest - Brookfield Orchard, Brookfield, MA
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well????
&gt;
&gt;Ric
