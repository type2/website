&gt; A few Weeks ago I painted my exhaust using POR-15  black exhaust paint.

This amazes me, painted the new Dansk pipes with their
silver stuff (higher temp rated so I got it instead) and
it really has not done that well for me, though I did not
have time to sandblast the pipes at the time which surely
would help the adhesion.  It seems durable enough just on
mine flakes off.  But these were smooth pipes which I had
just only wiped the primer off.  On the one already rusty
pipe I left on the system, adhesion has been better as it
had more &quot;bite&quot;  I feel if I took em off and grit blasted them
then repainted results might be quite good.  Still clinging
here and there and the ex-smooth pipes but lasted less than
2 months essentially.
