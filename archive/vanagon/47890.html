Subject: Cylindrical Awning or Tent Device

I crossed paths with a Westy travelling in the opposite direction which
carried a cylindrical, almost torpedo-like, canister over the sliding door.
 A friend who was with me said that he remembered that the tube carried
either a tent or an awning.  Does any list member have any infromation on
such an item for my '84 Westy?
