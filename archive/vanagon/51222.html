I used to get Cibie and Marshall headlights like you've described. They are
exacty as you described. Better on low beams and very good on high beams. I
went two steps better, the H4 bulb was available, at least 10 years ago, in
a 90/140 watt version. You probably have a 40/60 watt, or close to it in
there now. And I got a pair of Marshall spot lights with 100 watt H1 bulbs,
shining range on those was 5100 feet, yep, damn near a mile. I hooked those
up with a relay to come on with the high beams. You know, I never had to
flash anyone to tell them to tuern off their high \beams when I was driving
that old bus.
&gt;some Hella Vision Plus halogen lights. BIG improvement. H4 halogen bulb
&gt;(you can replace the bulb without having to replace the glass lense).
&gt;$37.50 each from Imparts in St. Louis.
