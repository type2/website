Subject: Needabus? -- Busses 4 sale in MD, DC, VA

Happy Hollydays!

Once again, here's a list of busses seen for sale in the Want Ad Weekly, a
publication in the MD, DC, VA area.  Their # is 703-642-9305 if you want to
get a copy or whatever.  Ok, most of these are relatively close to me so I
could possible check them out if desired.  I know there's other list members
in MD/DC/VA that may be closer so if you're intersted in one of these, post
a message to the vanagon list.  BTW, I'm leaving on the 24th for Sunny
Minnesota and won't be returning until the 2nd so I won't be able to do
diddly 'till then.
