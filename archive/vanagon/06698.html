NO! Please Martha, unless you have a death wish, don't try to jury-rig 
something like this. It's TOO DANGEROUS. There is no safe way to make the 
stove a space heater.

It seems than some of you are discounting the very real danger of carbon 
monoxide in a closed compartment.

A member of our Rotary club and his wife were killed last summer. He had
spent $500,000 on converting a barge on the Seine River in Paris into a
house boat. But the heater installation was faulty. Their grown kids found
the bodies three weeks after their death.

Carbon monoxide (contrary to popular myth) has no odor. There is no warning.
