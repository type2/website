&gt; Jeeeeze, Harold!  I can certainly understand WHY!!!!!!

To be considerate, I take lightly traveled trails.  Sometimes I pass
two people going the other way, but usually I see no one before or
after making the noise.

BTW, the tuba sounds great in a vanagon, slightly muffled though since
the bell shoots straight up into the ceiling.

(I had to mention a VW somehow in this message.)
