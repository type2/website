&gt;        One question, can any one tell me the cost of the Bentley manual for
&gt;80-91 buses. I've seen it advertised here for about 60 English pounds, which
&gt;is pretty hefty, the Haynes manual is less than 15.

the suggested retail price in the  states is about $90 US ... but if you
look around in some of the magazines, you can find it for as low as $55.
also check more than one vw dealer (some of them stock it) ... my dealer in
atlanta sold it to me for $60, while the local yo-yo wanted $98 for it.
