&gt;MediVan has about 30 center two person Vanagon seats
with seat belts available to the highest bidder(s).  These
seats were removed when their 30+ Vanagons were still
new so these seats are in excellent condition.

 I believe all have
head rests, flip forward backs and most are grey fabric of the
'87, '88, '90 and '91style.  There are some blue and beige
from '84 and maybe '85 Vanagons.

====================================================
I got ahold of one such seat several years ago in order to add an extra seat
and make my van into an 8 passenger van.  I was able to disassemble the seat,
cut it in half and rebuild it into a single seat.  I got mounting rails and
bolts etc. from a wrecking yard van, and was able to install it next to the
existing two passenger middle seat.  This newly added seat retailns the &quot;flip
forward&quot; feature of the seat back to facilitate entry to the third row seat. 
Anybody interested in what I remember of the details, feel free to contact me.
