I use a stovetop espresso maker when camping.  Kinda like what you have, but 
makes one big very strong cup of coffee, or 4 demitasse cups worth.
Percolating coffee is not the best way to make good coffee... but then 
not everyone like espresso.

Oh, and as far as I know... you just let the thing percolate for about 5 
minutes.  The premise is that it keeps putting the coffee/water through 
the grounds.  I'd suggest a Melita drip maker.  :)
