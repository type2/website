Wendy,

Your problem sounds like the switch to me.  Since the wires are accessible, 
I would recommend checking it out with a voltmeter (if you have those 
skills).  I use a stick pin to penetrate the wire insulation to do my 
measurements rather than following the wire to some inaccessible connection 
point.

BTW, I think that my Bentley is the same as yours.  The only thing that I 
have on the heater blower is in the electrical schematics.  Take a look.

Mike

Last week our highest speed on the heater fan (front) motor quit
working and now none of the speeds work.  I looked in the Bentley manual
and could only find reference to Diesel and air cooled heater fans.  My
manual is 1980 through 1985 Vanagons.  My camper is an '85 built in '84.
What should I be looking for?  Is this too a resistor problem as in
HEATER BLOWER RESISTOR REPLACEMENT&quot; previously on this list page?  If
anyone has the same manual can they point me to the correct page number.
Thanks,
Wendy
'85 Westy&quot;
