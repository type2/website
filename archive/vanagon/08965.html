Interestingly enough back in 1971 two friends and yours truly decided
to follow the Can Am circuit for a couple of weeks in the Lemon Yellow
66 Double Cab pick up. The front VW emblem was painted up in an
American Flag motif, the pick up bed had a large plywood box
where we kept our camping stuff, etc...(the real stuff &lt;fireworks,e
tc...  ;-)&gt; was under the rear seat behind the access panel for
the fuel tank   8-)) and behind the big box was an old love seat
so we would have a place to sit and watch the races...

We did Mosport, Watkins Glen, etc, and crossed the Canadian/US border
at least 4 times! Never given more than a quick look over....never 
stopped and searched...

About 5 years later in the 1967 camper my first wife (the shithead) 
and yours truly went to Canada for a couple of weeks...this time
we were stopped and given a quick search on the way up...and then
a more thorough search by the US customs types on the way down...

Go figure!
