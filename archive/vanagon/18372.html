Subject: [f] Kavorkian drove a VW


Did anyone catch that Dr. Death used to drive a VW bus? He had a
pre-1972 bay window, white, with curtains and louvered side middle
windows.

I say &quot;used to&quot; because it was impounded when they found his last
customer inside it. There was a picture of it being towed away about 2
weeks ago, in some Bay Area newspaper.

That's the way to go...inside a VW! I hope he gets it back soon.
