Subject: Re: Oil?

I used to do slide presentations for Fortune 500 companies. And one of them
was the Lubrizol Corporation. Who are they? They provide oil additives 
for all of the motor oil in North America. Additives are what make oil
match the API/SAE specifications. (Mil spec too) If you cant get Castrol
40W oil, just buy a comparable brand with the same API/SAE specification.
All of the oils manufactured today will exceed the API/SAE spec from when
you car was manufactured. These specs are constantly upgraded as lubrication
technology is improved. Which just means that oil is oil as long as it
meets or exceeds the API/SAE specs specified for your vehicle. FYI - my
former daily driver was an '84 Civic CRX. I used the least expensive oil
I could buy that matched the API/SAE spec. Changed it every 3,000 miles.
And got 220,000 miles out of the engine until the rings went bad.
Really - oil is oil. Kinda like gas is gas.
