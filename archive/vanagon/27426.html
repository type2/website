Subject: Propane furnace for camping installation

After being inspired by Dave Garth's catalytic heater installation photos
and Elliot's installation of a furnace in his EV, I've decided to install
a heater behind my passenger seat. I have a propane connection there that
I installed for my chest fridge, so in the winter, I'll just swap the
fridge for the heater... 

I wanted to go with a forced-air furnace like Elliot's and vent it through
the front passenger wheel well, but I was worried about excessive current
draw.  [After parking at Jackson Hole Ski Resort for a week, would my
deep-cycle still be chugging????] Why does the furnace need 2.8 amps? Is
this just for the fan(s)? 

Anyway, after perusing the Camping World and West Marine wish books, I've
decided to go with the brass/SS Force 10 propane furnace (6,000 BTU) and
vent the exhaust through the luggage area of my pop-top. Hopefully, I'll
be able to make a bracket to bolt everything to the wheel well with a
sturdy platform on top of the furnace such that I can still sit in front
of the sink/stove for cooking dinner without burning my tush. (The 
furnace is 16&quot; tall.)

Does anyone have any comments about this furnace and/or my installation idea?
Thanks alot...
