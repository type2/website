&gt; I have the tube in my hand and it has no brand name but it's a white
&gt; tube and it's from VW and in three languages (German, English and
&gt; French) it only says:
&gt; 
&gt;     &quot;Genuine: Constant velocity Joints. G6.2&quot;
&gt;     &quot;Contents 90g            Made in Germany&quot;
&gt; 

I just did my Jetta: the new Lobro joint came with a blue tube of 
Lobro grease. The new boot also came with a tube of &quot;Meiserzatz&quot; 
grease (the brand of the boot). I used the extra tube to repack the 
inner joint. I've also used CDN tire CV grease, comes in a 500g tub, 
appears very similar to the german stuff I've used.
