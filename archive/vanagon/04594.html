Subject: Re: Need Vanagon Tires

&gt;O
&gt;They are indeed stamped &quot;reinforced&quot;, but I'll try to verify that they 
&gt;comply.  I watch the tire pressure pretty carefully, typically running 
&gt;them at about 36# (vs. the 32# recommended).  I've experimented all the 
&gt;way up to 40#, the maximum rating of the tire.  



Reinforced can imply thicker rubber/filler materials in the side walls, and 
nothing more. For a good example of this try to flex a Pirelli Winter 190 in 
a size appropriate to vans. These are stiff tires, I highly recommend them 
for all out winter driving, I use four! BUT they are not C6 or LT rated, and 
they will squirm a bit in hard dry spring time driving. The fact that you 
mention that the Michelins max pres. is 40psi means that they are NOT what 
you want, the tires should max out at 55 psi, and run them at 36-44 psi, 
pref 36. You want real truck tires, not beefed up car tires. My panel used 
to be as light a vanagon as possible, and when I put 1500 lbs of concrete 
block in it, the front 4 ply tire pancaked out, while the rear C6's looked 
normal. I now have C6 all round.
