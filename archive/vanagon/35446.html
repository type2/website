I ran into this too.  Got a 2 L out of a wrecked '79 with the idea of dropping 
the engine into a '73.  Turned out that in '79 they went to vanagon aircooled 
heads with a different head to exhaust manifold connection.  The heater boxes 
on the '79 looked just like the '73 ones on all other respects but are not 
interchangable.  The '79 boxes that I have are rusted out though.  Thought about 
stripping the skins from a couple of extra 73 boxes and putting them on the '79s 
but it got too complicated once I found out that the 2 L engine cost riduculous 
amounts to rebuilt compared with the 1.7 L engine in the '73, so I rebuilt the 
1.7 instead.  I looked at a couple of early 80's aircooled vanagons and I think 
that the exhaust system from these is mountable on the '79 engine.  Looked at a 
'82 and the boxes were exactly like the '73 and '79 boxes but had the vanagon 
head mounting ports.  Suggest that you go to someplace with the old heater box 
in hand and see what their early 80's exhaust systems and heater boxes look 
like.  If your in CA then there were lots of weird plumbing arrangements used.  
Here in Canada they seemed to use the non catilytic converter systems into the 
mid 80s on these vans.  It may be that a Non-CA exhaust system for one of the 
early '80s vanagons is a direct match for your van.

Good Luck

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 	I am trying to order some heat exchangers for a '79 bus and since 
&gt; they appear to be a one year only, I am having a hard time finding them.  
&gt; One place has a &quot;type4 heat exchanger for '79&quot; but it is for the 
&gt; 411/412.  Will this work on a bus?  (I'm guessing that it won't, but I 
&gt; wanted to check to see before counting it out.) 
&gt; 
&gt; 	A place called CA Import Parts LTD has the correct exchangers but 
&gt; they are $40 more apiece than the ones above. If I need to go here has 
&gt; anyone dealt with them and what do you think about them?
&gt; 
&gt; 	I am hoping to order these today so that I will have them by the 
&gt; middle of next week so I can get this bus back together and back on the 
&gt; road. 
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help.
