Subject: RE (2): fuel line stoppers


&gt; &gt;Pencils are in the Idiots Guide as the fuel line plug of choice.
&gt; &gt;I have been using golf tees with good success for many years. Good
&gt; &gt;Luck.
&gt; 
&gt; Normally I like Muir, but he musta had a bad day while writing that
&gt; procedure.

.and I'll bet golf tees never even crossed his mind!
