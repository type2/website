  Those pesky oil galley plugs are known for popping out during
          periods of high oil pressure, like when first starting the
          engine on a cold moring. They can be replaced with
          threaded pipe plugs, though. This would mean removing the
          engine to get to the front (FIF) one, and removing
          the fan housing for the rear one. This is highly
          recommended during a T-4 rebuild, and can be done while
          the engine is together. Just be careful to suck out any
          metal shavings that may be left in the galleys, and use
          thread locking compound on the plugs



&gt;&gt;      I own an 82 Westy  with 141K miles.  At 100K I was leaking a quart
&gt;&gt;      every 400 miles.   It was not the oil cooler, it was not the
&gt;&gt;          gasket at the oil filter bracket, it was not the crankcase
&gt;&gt;          seal.  I had to bench start the engine with no sheetmetal
&gt;&gt;          on it to find it.  It was the factory installed
&gt;&gt;          (supposedly permanently pressed in) oil galley plug. You
&gt;&gt;          know, where they drilled the hole for oil to flow to the
&gt;&gt;          main bearings in the case at the factory.  The plug was
&gt;&gt;          loose so I got a punch and peened the alluminum case
&gt;&gt;          material over the plug and it sealed fine.  However, now
&gt;&gt;          it is happening again at
&gt;&gt;          141K ----probably a different oil galley plug.  Rick,    I
&gt;&gt;          think this is nothing but poor engineering but I doubt if
&gt;&gt;          we can do anything about it.
