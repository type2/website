Subject:      Re: Brake Drums

&gt;Does anybody know if brake drums for a '74 camper can be
&gt;used on a '91 Vanagon Camper?

doesn't sound stupid to me. i had always heard that the rear brakes were the
same from 1971 to 1991.

HOWEVER ... a look at the fiche again says: welllllll, maybe.

buses use part number  211-501-615 G
   and there is a chassis number split, but it seems to indicate all of the
   years (?):    F  - 210-2300-000  which is a 1970 bus, right?
                (F -- 218-109-82    which is a 1968 bus, right?

the vanagon fiche, however, shows pat number  251-609-615
   (but all years of vanagons 1980-1991 use this part number)

i think i would bet on the safe side and NOT use the 74 drums. see if you can
find some from a 80 vanagon.
