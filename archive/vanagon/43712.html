Subject: oil pressure readings
Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 18:55:32 -0700

I finally got my gauges all hooked up and working. Today, I got the 
following oil pressure readings:

Engine Cold:
50psi _at_ idle
70psi _at_ 3000 rpm

Engine Warm (oil temp 210F):
15psi _at_ idle
45psi _at_ 3000 rpm

I was suprised to see such high readings when the engine is cold. The 
pressure gradually goes down as the engine warms up and the oil gets less 
viscous. I'm using Mobil1 15W50 oil. Are these pressures relatively normal?
