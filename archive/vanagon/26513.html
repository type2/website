Hi Alexis! I talked to Pucho yesterday, he's expecting your call after 7 p.m.
(P.R. time). I remind you his telephone number: (809) 265-7901 (home) and
(809) 834-2228, 834-0770 (both at work). I'm going with my family to the  
Caguas Bug-In next Sunday and I'll look for your father Rene. As soon you get toPuerto Rico please call me (765-7689--home). Looking forward to see you soon.
Best regards,

Angel
