Subject: GEX rebuilt tranny?
Date: Mon, 21 Aug 95 13:17:12 PDT

I have the ever so popular 'popping out of 4th gear' syndrome in
my '65 bus. It's only popping out when I climb hills but I going
to start socking money away for a new tranny now.

I see a lot of talk on this list about GEX engines. What kind of
quality can I expect from a GEX rebuilt tranny?  And since I'm a
novice mechanic, how difficult is it to take one out and put one
in?(tranny that is!)

Your comments would be greatly appreciated.
