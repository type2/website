Subject: RE: #3 late timing.


&gt;that when timing a 1965 or later Bug, you will find that #3
&gt;cylinder is late firing while the other three seem to check
&gt;out.  Don't worry--it is supposed to be that way.  The
&gt;reason #3 cylinder is late firing as compared to the others
&gt;is that in 1965 Volkswagen gave a special grind to the cam
&gt;in the distributor to cause #3 to fire 2-1/2 degrees late.
&gt;This was done to aid cooling of #3 cylinder which is
&gt;farthest away from the fan.&lt;unquote&gt;

Anyone who puts a 009 distributor (centrifugal advance only) in their
VW, will get this side benny also. The mod carried over into all 009's,
I believe.
