Ed,
Have you checked the center steering link?  That's the most common cause of
steering play in your model of vehicle.  A kit should take care of it.  You
have to replace the pin, two bronze bushings, and the washers that take up
the play.  The major cause of this component wearing out is lack of
lubrication.  When you do replace this, make sure that you're not missing the
grease fitting that lubricates it, and make sure that whoever's changing your
oil is lubing this thing every time.  Let me know if you need a kit part #
