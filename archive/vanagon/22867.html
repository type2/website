Subject: Introduction

Hi Everyone,
My nettiquette is pretty poor as well, so a belated intro.
I am Scott Bogen, 33, of Atlanta GA (lived 32 1/2 years just outside 
Minneapolis on a lake, thought I would trade the -30 weather for the 
pleasant south, it was +111 on the road today, so much for pleasant 
south). After wanting one for the past 10 years I finally am the owner 
of a '77 Westfalia, it is that bizarre shade of green that I have only 
seen in Life magazine as a kid in the pictures of bacteria. Full deluxe 
package, all original and everything works. It is a great bus, but have 
not been able to take it camping yet as the heat would either kill it 
or me. I am single, dog=Duffy= old english sheepdog (who is really 
missing the lake about now) I am an Internet trainer with my own micro 
company, Pro-surf. I am a Deadhead, and this past week was just 
horrible, I was so hoping to take the bus on tour this fall. Would love 
to meet others who live down here in Atlanta, I have never owned a VW 
before, let alone a used vehicle, so this group is great as I have been 
reading all your advise, Can't wait to do my Valve adjustment this 
weekend! Thanks for your help and advise.
Peace,
Scoob          &quot;Standing on the moon, with nothing better to do,
                A lovely view of heaven, but I'd rather be with you&quot;
