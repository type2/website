Philly parade mistake...

OOPS!!!  The parade in Lansdale PA is Sept 21, 1997 not the 28 (the 28 =
is the
rain date).  Sorry.


&gt;Parade is in Lansdale, PA (40 minutes  north of Philadelphia) Sept 28. =
 Gather
&gt;at some spot
&gt;(tbd) around 10 or 11 a.m., move as a group to the parade staging area =
so as
&gt;to be put in
&gt;the parade as a group.  Parade then moves thru Lansdale to the Olean =
Tile
&gt;Company
&gt;premises where everybody parks and looks around.  Typically there are =

&gt;hundreds of cars,
&gt;all makes, years, customized, etc...  Last year they had activities for =
kids with
&gt;prizes,
&gt;give-aways, food, etc...  (no cost except for food and trinkets).

&gt;Any VW's interested first e-mail me privately.  If there's enough intere=
st I will
&gt;go ahead.
