Subject: Michelin Tires

Any thoughts on the Michelin XC/LT4 LT195/75R14 as a good tire for an 84
Westie? And on this endless subject, how come Volkswagen of America does
not/will not supply specific tires suggestions for Westies?  Or why do tire
companies only provide recommendations for the standard Vanagon?
