Subject: 1981 Van running rich, FI problems SOLVED [long...]

This is a long story but it has a happy ending.  I will try to keep it
brief.
 
I bought my 1981 Westy in the spring of 1993 and have really enjoyed
it.  The brick will go just about anywhere and is pretty roomy.  And
the view from on high is great.
 
But there was a persistent fuel injection problem that was driving me
crazy.  It was running rich and wouldn't pass the smog test.  And the
gas mileage was terrible.  Sometimes as low as 8 MPG in town and about
10-14 on the highway.  My main concern was lack of top end lubrication
since the excess of gas might &quot;wash&quot; the rings and lead to premature
piston wear.
 
I tried just many things including a new (&quot;rebuilt&quot;) air flow sensor,
new OXY sensor, new temperature sensor.  No soap.  One garage found
that &quot;the auxiliary air valve needed replacing&quot; and then showed me a
nonofficial emissions printout that showed that idle CO was OK.  It
seemed to run a little better, but I tested it a few months later, and
it was still way to rich.
 
I then did some serious diagnostic work with the Bosch F.I. book and
found that 
1) injectors OK
2) cold start valve OK
3) Fuel pressure OK
4) fuel pressure regulator OK
5) temperature sensor OK
6) thermo-time switch OK
7) spark plugs look OK but with blackened appearance (too rich).
7) (NEW) air flow meter OK
8) Down to the computer. uh oh.

     The FI book has a really nice description of theory and operation
of the &quot;lambda&quot; circuit which controls the amount of fuel that get
injected to match the amount of air arriving through the air sensor.
On a non-lambda computer the amount of fuel is calculated by the
amount of air flow sensed by the air flow meter.  On lambda
(California?) computers, the output of the OXY sensor is fed back to
the computer to adjust the fuel mixture for perfect stoichiometry
(14.7:1).  For example, when the exhaust system contains oxygen then
the sensor goes low (&lt; 0.5 V) and the computer increases fuel.  You
can monitor this process at idle speeds with a high input impedance
digital voltmeter.  When the circuit is working properly the voltage
at the sensor should oscillate between .2 and .8 volts or so.  Well in
my case it always stayed at 0.  So even though the exhaust was rich
the computer thought it was lean and made things worse.  The OXY
sensor was fine however, so that if I disconnected it from the
computer and monitored the voltage it varied nicely between 0.1 and
0.8V as I adjusted to CO screw on the air box.  So I became convinced
that the computer was bad and it must have had some time of internal
short that was pulling the output of the sensor down.
 
I took it to a dealer to test whether the computer was bad. They found
&quot;the vacuum line to the fuel regulator was leaking&quot;, and replaced a
short length of rubber tubing ($85 total).  When I asked about
emissions he said &quot;Oh the CO is around 0.5% now at idle, and that is
normally difficult to obtain. I'm sure it will be fine at cruising
speeds.&quot;
 
We took it on a long trip and it still had its old problems,
especially lack of power at high altitudes, presumably because it was
running far too rich.  When we got back I got hold of a CO meter and
did myself what I had asked the dealer to do, which was to test the
computer.  There are two tests in the Bosch book called the lean-stop
test and the rich stop test.  You measure the CO, make sure it is OK
then make the mixture too rich or too lean and see if the computer is
able to readjust the mixture appropriately.  Wrong.... Fail....
Trouble.....  Then on a lark I hooked up a D-cell (flashlight battery)
to the OXY sensor input into the computer.  Guess what?  It worked.
The computer responded and made the mixture very lean as judged by the
CO in the exhaust.  So it seemed like there really was an internal
short in the computer that was blocking any useful output from the OXY
sensor.  Then for some real fun.  I hooked up an ammeter and found out
that the computer was pulling ***2 AMPS*** out of the D-cell.  This
was one serious short!
 
I investigated and found that I could get a bargain on a new computer
for $600 ($100 less than the dealer), and was trying to decide whether
I could live with the underpowered, rich-running van or should I bite
the bullet and make it work right......
 
Maybe it was in my sleep but somehow I got the idea that maybe it was
the wiring.  A couple of people had mentioned this possibility
including the dealer!  I started tracking down the wiring and a
continuity test showed that the OXY sensor line was good all the way
to the big connector on the computer.  The wiring diagram showed that
there were two connections from sensor to the computer, though, and
one was slightly higher resistance (1 ohm) than the other (0.2ohm).  I
considered that the connector might be dirty or something and then
took apart the computer connector.  It was then that I discovered the
problem.  What had looked like one line going to two connectors on the
computer was in fact a two connector line.  The OXY sensor is a
relatively low voltage signal, so it is protected by a shielded cable.
Therefore the 1 ohm signal that I had measured was actually the short!
 
Finally to make a long story short... No pun intended.... Well maybe.
 
     THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE OXY SENSOR CONNECTOR.  The shield (a few
strands of copper wire) that surrounds the main conductor was touching
it right at the crimp connector a the end of the wire from the
computer to the sensor.  It looked as if the crimp connector had been
flexed enough times (during engine removal etc) that it had broken the
insulation and now the shield wire was so close that it was touching.
The fix was simply to cut back the shield wires, and install a new
crimp connector.
 
It really does run well now.  It doesn't stall out when cold, and will
go faster than 65 MPH.  We had a few legs on a recent trip where the
mileage was greater than 20!
 
For me the morals of the story are: 1) Even fuel injection systems can
be fixed by folks like 2) Get as much information as you can.  In this
case it isn't the dealer or a mechanic or even (blasphemy) the net. It
is the Bosch book.  It really is pretty complete.  And you can do a
lot without too many specialized tools.  3) The VW manual suggests
that you do continuity tests on the OXY sensor.  But don't forget to
do shorted tests as well.  I think that this probably applies to all
connectors.
 
one happy camper
