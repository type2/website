Subject: Brake Fluid Bleed Questions

Hi all,

I am attempting to replace the brake fluid in my '87 Westy and I have a couple
of questions:

1)  Bently mentions the bleed sequence and volumes.  It says there is a front
upper and a lower bleed screw, but does not show a diagram.  I only see a
single bleed screw on the front caliper.  Is this the only bleed screw in the
front?  If not, is that one  the upper or the lower?  Where is the other bleed
screw located?  If this is the only bleed screw, how much fluid should I remove
to ensure complete flushing with new fluid?

2)  Is the clutch hydraulic fluid derived from the same reservoir as the brake
fluid?  If so, should I bleed that, also?

Thanks a lot for your help.
