Subject: tips for gas tank replacement in '78?

The fuel level sender unit in my '78 has failed and I'm facing the removal
of the gas tank to get at it.  Bently says it can &quot;(barely)&quot; be done
without dropping the engine.  Anyone done this before?  I'd be grateful
for any tips.

Mucho thanks, Tim Burnett
