&gt;  Has anyone changed their Vacuum Advance on the Distributor to a
&gt; mechanical one as St. Muir suggests? If so, where can I procure one?
&gt; Will this change make any/much difference to my gas mileage? Does the
&gt; Bosche 009 come with a mech. advance? Thanks in Advance.

Whoops, sorry about the empty post...

I replaced my dual-diaphragm vacuum advance distributor in my 73 with
an all-mechanical advance (009) model.  Part-throttle driveability
was not very good, and I have since gone back to the stock distributor.
Another VW book gives the advice, &quot;Don't second guess the VW engineers&quot;,
and in this case I think it applies.
