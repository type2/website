Subject: re:Vanagon rear hatch bug screen

&gt;From unfortunate previous experience with Sacramento River Killer
Mosquitoes, use the rear hatch bug screen with CAUTION! At least on my
'83, the bottom of the screen has no positive attachment to the
doorframe and those clever, hungry bugs WILL find a way in. I am working
on a plan to attach extra fasteners to the engine deck, but until then I
will not use the rear screen, no matter how hot it is.
