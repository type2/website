Subject: '86 Weekender FS - Minnesota

okay.  the VW service manager called me on Friday to tell me that they just
took in an '86 Weekender. here the vitals:

price $6400

1 owner, serviced exclusively at this dealership (Auto Import, Bemidji MN,
218/751-9444).  all records available.

124,000 miles

4 speed

gold exterior.  brown corduroy interior.  drivers seat worn, the rest perfect.

recent water pump replacement

heads reportedly dry but likely the originals.  this can be verified at
dealer.

includes the 12v/110v portable fridge.  i had one and like these!

i have not looked at this van yet but can do so for anyone interested.
also, call the dealer and ask for &quot;JD&quot; who is the *service manager* not a
salesman for your questions.  tell 'im i sent ya. i don't get any
commission but he would get a kick out of knowing where the tip came from.
