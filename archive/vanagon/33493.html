Subject: Vanagon Stalling (follow up)

Thanks to everyone who responded to my latest mechanical travails!  It
appears to be the fuel pump that is causing the stalling.  Mechanic says
that it is making all sorts of racket while running that it shouldn't be
making so hopefully this is it.  Not a cheap part, though--around $175 for a
new Bosch unit--but at least it looks like I won't be fumbling around
replacing parts.
