Subject: 	An Early Friday for Early Buses!

Here is a modest proposal:

We all have our own perspective on the ages of various buses. It could 
depend on when we were  going to high school, or whenever our conciousness 
was first raised about the details and differences between the years of 
various vehicles then in production. Because of this  there  will  always 
be a natural disagreement between listers as to what is an early bus.

To remedy this problem, I propose we classify ourselves, the listers, into 
four catagories: Ancient Listers (AL), Early Listers (EL) Medium Listers 
(ML) and Late Listers (LL). You can  use  the following descriptors to 
determine personal list catagories (LC), then simply attach  your LC  to 
your signature line. Whenever you see a post  that an &quot;early bus&quot; or 
whatever,  has been sighted, you can check the author=92s LC to decipher the 
message into terms that are meaningful to your own personal perspective.

This also means we will not have to waste bandwidth on determining
what an early bus really is.  Here are descriptions of my proposed 
catagories, and the ways each group considers buses:

Ancient  Listers (AL) perceive buses in the following catagories: Early 
Barndoors, Barndoors, Middle Splitties, Late Splitties, Breadloafs, Dry 
Vanagons, Non-Buses.

Early Listers(EL):  Early Splitties, Late Splitties, Early Breads, Late 
Breads, Vanagons (dry), Vanagons (wet),  FWD vehicles.

Medium :Listers (ML) see the world as: Splitties,Early Breads,Late Breads, 
Dry Vanagons, Oil Burner Vanagons, Early Wet Vanagons, Middle Wet 
Vanagons, Vanagons with power heated mirrors, EVs.

Late Listers (LL) view the situations as : Ancient Buses, Early Buses, Wet 
Vanagons, Dry Vanagons,  Evs, EV campers (German), EV Campers (Iowan) , 
FutureVs  (EVs with V6)

I am certain this will  eliminate confusion and help the list with its 
business.;-)  Please take care to include your catagory with every future 
post.

Eliminate confusion?  Why not just put the year of the bus,  that seems simple enough.
