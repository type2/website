Subject: RE: I'm SICK of cookies!

Okay, I've seen this cookie crap so much now that I propose a change be 
made to the Vanagon_at_lenti welcome message which states that we have all 
seen the stupid cookie stuff and that posting it will result in swift and 
painful ignoral and a hearty laugh at the fool which posted it and fell 
for it.  What d'ya think sirs?
