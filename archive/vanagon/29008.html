Phoned these people, the stuff is $37/gal, 60sq ft. coverage.  So 2 gals 
would do walls and roof, another gal. for the underneath?  Not a bad price 
compared to urethane foams. 
        They also offer a 'high efficiency' compressor type fridge/freezer,  
$595 + 25 shipping, internet special $495+, holds 28 quarts.  6 x 6packs. 
That's a lot of beer :0)  Note that it is a freezer too! One of the benefits 
of a real compressor system vs. absorption type in the Westy.   Currently it 
is only available as a portable cooler, they are releasing a bigger built-in 
soon.
