Subject: Brick Trek

I am not likely to be able to caravan along very much next summer, but I have
the opinion that you may get more participation by announcing a series of 
points or events.  E.g. &quot;The [insert final choice of name] will be at the
Exampletown Holiday Inn from 5pm June 3 till 10am June 5.  Note that the 
Exampletown Swap Meet is June 4, and that the Exampletown Amusement Park
opens May 30.&quot;  This would imply but not require that people caravan from 
point to point, and allow (1) those of us with tough work schedules and (2)
sponsors of other related groups and events, to make contact with the Brick
Circus as it passed close to our homes.

On that basis, I hope that the trip makes at least one of its stops in a
n area say southeast of Utica and north of Delaware.  If you get close enough,
I'd be happy to help you choose a spot where you could use public transporta-
tion rather than privately owned buses to get into NYC, for those with an
interest in that kind of wildlife.
