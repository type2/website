&gt;also, a mystery was solved.  Chevy El Caminos disappeared from
&gt;Minnesota during the Ice Age.

Which one? This year's? Last year's? The year before...???


&gt;but there remains one California mystery unsolved...
&gt;How do keep all those plastic reflectors imbedded in the roads from
&gt;being scraped off by the snowplows?

What's a snowplow?
