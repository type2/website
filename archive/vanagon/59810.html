Subject: Speedometer markings

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone knew what the dot markings on the speedometer
mean. This is in an 83 WB. There are dots at certain points. There is
one dot at 20, two dots at 40, and three at 65. Are these supposed to be
the top speeds for each gear? My westy would be screaming at 50 in third
gear, and 20 in first....forget about it. My Westy doesn't have a tach
(yet) so usually use the st muir guide of 10, 20, 40 when driving. What
speed/rpms do other people shift at? Thanks.

Dave
