Yo!

	Well, I got new tires today.  Yesterday I got the Porta Walls
fromm Coker, which I why I waited until today to get the tires.

	Anyway, I got Winston 195/65's, with a 50,000 mile warranty.  They
seem OK.  I picked this place for a number of reasons: 1) they were open
on a Sat; 2) they didn't try to sno-job me; 3) they actutally have the
gizmo adapter to balance the early 5 lug wheels!  It was $355 total, out
the door, tax 'n everything' I think the base price was $64 per tire.

	The porta walls kind don't fir right, or so it would seem,.  They 
look like they are creeping out a bit.  I can adjust them if I let the
air out, so I think I'll try that on a cold morning and see what happens.
In either case, with the newly painted wheels, the bus looks suhweet!

	I painted the wheels in the traditional VW style - colored centers
with white outers.  In retrospect, I prolly shoulda done it the opposite,
so the white of the whitewalls stands out from the white of the tires.
Oh well.  I prolly also should used the wheels I had on the bus, instead
of the ones I did use, cause it turns out that the ones on the bus are
in _much_ better shape.

	However, Yesterday at the computer store I noticed a puddle under 
the bus, which I thought was oil but turned out to be tranny fluid.  Ditto
when I got home.  Turned out one of the boots split.  I musta brain-farhted
when I put the boots on in the first place 'cause I'd bought a new set back 
then.  The other boot is cherry, so I bought 2 and replaced one and put hte
the other in the Magic Parts Box.

	I tried to adjust the valves this morning, but was stymied by the
funky distributor.  Still stalled out on what to do...
