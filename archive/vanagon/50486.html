Subject: looking for a Westy...
Date: Tue, 15 Oct 96 23:18:16 EDT

Hey all,
Well, this weekend's camping excursion has convinced me that I NEED a
Westy, so now I am officially looking.  But, I will wait until I find
the right one for the right price, there will be no settling.  What I am
looking for is a '75-'83.5 Westfalia pop-top camper, with sink, stove,
and fridge (fridge optional but I suppose that the stove ones have
fridges too).  I'm thinking of a Vanagon Westy, but it would have to be
aircooled, but a breadloaf Westy with all the aforementioned goodies
would work too :)

I actually did look at an '80 Vanagon for sale in Richmond on Monday.
Guy was asking $3400.  Canvas was excellent as was all the camping gear,
but it had no stove or fridge, just sink.  Engine was decent, it drove
well, but it needs front suspension work and big-time rust repair, plus
some minor interior work (replacement of some climate-control stuff).
But there is some rust, it's isolated but it is RUST-THROUGH and I don't
have the $$$ to fix that.  It did have a gas heater, but the owner said
he didn't have the courage to fire it up.  It's definitely not a $3400
bus, maybe closer to $1500 but I doubt he'd go that low.

Sean
