Subject: Re: BILL OF SALE QUESTION
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 1995 12:07:13 GMT


&gt; I need to know some info from anyone who's bought/sold a vehicle
&gt; in California recently, as today as Saturday, and I can't phone
&gt; the DMV.  
&gt; 
&gt; Is a pink slip with the previous owners signature and date sufficient
&gt; to transfer owndership?  What if he forgot to sign and fill in and
&gt; date the odometer reading?
&gt; 
&gt; Is a bill of sale in addition to the above necessary?  Exceptions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks - need to know this as soon as possible.......

My recent experience is that you must have a bill of sale in addition
to the signed pink slip. If the pink slip is missing, the previous
owner can sign a DMV form to request a new one (with a $7.00 fee).
Be prepared to pay all sorts of fines if the registration is not
current. The old certificate of non-operation will not help at all
anymore.

If you have the signed pink slip, just fill in the odometer reading,
and have the registered owner write and sign a little note saying
that he sold the car to you, The bill of sale does not require a
special form. BTW, the previous owner haas to pay all of the parking
tickets. You can still make a deal as to whether the buyer or the
seller will do the smogging. Be careful though; without a written
deal, the seller is required to do the smogging.

At least in California the bill of sale and the title do not have to
be notarized.
