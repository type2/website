Subject: Re: Joy of tranny main bearings

&gt;Recently I began to notice an ever so slight growling sound when my '87
&gt;Syncro (58k) sits at idle in neutral. Additionally, the growling sound goes
&gt;away when I depress the clutch.

&gt;3. Given my current state - slight growling - how long can I safely run
&gt;before I must have this work done, and am I risking other damage by doing
&gt;so?

I have had the same noise in my 73 bus for years. I could swap it for a good 
used one but, since it's not got noticably worse in that time and I've been 
assured it'll last forever and not to worry about it, I'll run it to death 
first. Then again, if yours *does* self-destruct, secondhand synchro 
transmissions aren't that easy to come by.
