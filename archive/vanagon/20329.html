Subject: RE: TRANSMISSION FRONT MOUNT
Date: Thu,  6 Jul 1995 13:15:29 GMT

&gt; I've got a 79.  On bad days(1 out of 7) when I shift from 2nd to 3rd on hills 
&gt; I get the same kind of jerking from the trans.  I always just 
&gt; thought it was an old tranny(200,000).  How do I find the front tranny
&gt; bolts?
&gt; Paul

The mount on a '79 is a little different from the mount on my '71
(it has more rubber). 

Look at the very front of the tranny. You will see where the shift
linkage connects on top. Below that is the fron mount. Check the
rubber for cracks. Check to see that all of the bolts, studs, and
nuts are still there, and that they are tight. Good luck!
