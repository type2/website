Subject: Sticking sliding door


My 84 has developed the annoying problem of during cold (as if it ever
gets cold in California) the leading edge (closest to the back of the van)
does not pop away from the door frame enabling the door to slid backwards.
As the outside temperature increases, this problem goes away.  I have been
too lazy to pull off the inner door panel and see if the latch is
sticking.  It appears that there is a black spring-loaded hinge which
moves with the door.  With my luck, this is the problem and is a special
VW part which will have to be specially imported from Germany for an
astronomical price.  Anyone else had this problem.  If so is there a less
expensive way to purchase parts for the van without walking into the local
VW deal (who I have had bad experiences with in the past) with check book
in hand?
