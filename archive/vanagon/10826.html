Subject: VW Collection Sale reprise...

&gt;Add in Houston Chronicle:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;VW Collection, 25 cars, (7) Things, '69 Ghia conv., '62 Bug conf., '65
&gt;ragtop, '57 DBL door van, '74 custom beetle, showcars, many others, parts
&gt;cars, mis. parts. In Alvin [TX], 713/581-2810&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I'm going after that van :-)

I visited Mary and what hadn't sold yet on Saturday.  (A Ghia was towed
away as I arrived and a Thing was sold but not retrieved.)

'57 double-double-door Panel. 36hp engine. Bench seat. Someone did a
partial/cheesy resto job on this somewhen. Had the little door on the rear
engine tin for closing the hole where the hand-crank goes into the main
pulley. Roof and rain gutters are straight.  Doors are straight.  Quite a
bit of body-filler under the primer, especially on the corners.  Ding in
the right front, headlight level, that slightly creases the front and door
interface (door still works fine.  Lots of surface rust underneath, but
didn't see any structural-depth rust.  The usual belly pans for this model
were there and intact, so the frame ribs and under-floor are probably
solid.  Major rust at the bottoms of the windshields.  No bezels on the
front turn signals. Heater control worked smoothly.  Had a plate for an
ambulance fan, but no guts.  Mary says she has new rubber for everything
but one door (that's a LOT of rubber.  She said the only offer so far was
for $500 (and she'll probably hold out for more).  I recognized it as far
more work than I'll ever have time for (The Bozobus is quite a timesink as
it is...)...  Someone with more time/money/skill than me could make a very
nice Panel out of this.

It was really nice to spend some time with another person who lives and
breathes VWs.
