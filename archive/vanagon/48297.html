Subject: Parting out another '59 Single Cab and various Buses '59-'81

At the Bug-In at Bandemere Speedway last weekend, I noticed pictures of a '59
Single Cab for sale. I chatted with the owner and by the end of the day, I
was the proud owner. It is pretty straight, but has some pan rust and no
title. I only needed a few parts from it, and plan to sell the extra parts to
other list members. I am also parting out '68 and '73 Buses, '70 and '73
Westies, '59 and '63 Single cabs, and an '81 Vanagon. If anybody needs
anything, please E-mail. I am happy to ship COD in the continental US. All of
the parts are German, guaranteed and fairly priced.
Thanks,
Josh
