Subject: hoses for pipes

Hi all
I had my Transporter checked, and the mechanic said that the long
coolant pipes under tha car were leaking. Replacement costs $1200. I
wonder if it would be possible to use reinforced plastichoses to replace
the bad parts of the pipe. Any experiences?
Thanks for many valuable and entertaining contributions.
