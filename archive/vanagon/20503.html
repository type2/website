1962 Walk-through Kombi project: Doors are removed, windows 
out, etc. All there, slight rust: easy fix. Includes a VERY
strong 1600 Dual Port, new seat upholstry and foam from Sewfine
(white faces, gray sides vinyl $200 paid).
Located 1 1/2 hours out of Minneapolis. 
Front end has new Link pins, bearings and races, rebuilt brake
cylinders, new pads, etc. Drives GREAT!
Needs reassembly and it is a driver, or very slight rust repair
and pain for a great Bus.

I am taking more time for my career, and do not have time
to finish this project.

$1500 firm (1/2 of what is invested so far-- a steal!)

I will put photos of the bus on the World Wide Wed at:
