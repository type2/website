Subject: VW Cold Weather Testing

Well, they're at it again...

VW has begun its annual cold weather testing of new models here in Bemidji,
tho their assemblege of vehicles this year is scant.  a few Jetta-like cars
and an Audi are putting around, racking up miles and doing the shakedown
testing to debug the bugs.  it is interesting to note that while the grill
logo on both the VWs and the Audi is still prominently displayed, all other
model identifying badges are absent (Badges? We Don't Need No Steenkin'
Badges!!).  I'm sure this keeps the paraparazzi at bay.

those of you wanting to drive pre-production models and spend your day
motoring around northern Minnesota can come and apply for one of the 'test
driver' jobs offered.  while one would like to think that eager,
car-oriented individuals would be sought to give meaningfull entries into
the driver's log of each test vehicle, alas.  such is not true.  i
personally know a couple of the drivers and more sedate, un-auto-interested
people could not be found.  but of course, they are Nice people, as most
Minnesotans are.  :)  it's just that we make lousy test drivers.

Last year's pickings saw a Sharron, a suspicious Eurovan with an enormous
exhaust pipe, a Passat or two, and a flock of Jettas and Golfs.... maybe the
cold weather got to them this year.  or they used the wrong colored anti-freeze.
