&gt; Hey all,
&gt;         I have a question.  I was out looking at a '78 bus today and I
&gt;         think I really like it but there was something weird going on
&gt;         with the hazard flashers and turn signals.  OK, none of the
&gt;         bulbs are burnt out, but when the key is in the on position, the
&gt;         turn signals don't work.  The indicator light on the dash comes
&gt;         on and stays on without blinking and none of the outside turn
&gt;         signal lights light up.  Same with the hazard flasher.  However,
&gt;         when the key is off, the hazard flashers work fine.  What could
&gt;         be causing this?  Is something wired wrong or is a relay
&gt;         defective or maybe a short circuit somewhere?  Please help as
&gt;         this bus only needs minimal work + paint and it would be pretty
&gt;         nice.
&gt; 
&gt;         Sean
