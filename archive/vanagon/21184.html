I'm not sure those things ever existed in crystal, but usually 
were ceramic.  RMM (and its subsidiaries) offer them, as do
other simlar places.  They don't come cheap - maybe $25 or
so in my recollection.  While I was recently in Yosemite
for the last part of the GNATT tour, I saw something in
their Ansel Adams gift store for about $7 I thought would work
- similar type vase - glass as I recall, with a metal holder,
and the holder had a magnet on the back.  This would make
it easy to affix to the dash of many of our cars.  Although
at the time I had no way to test the strength of the magnet,
it seemed quite strong.  Wouldn't be hard to rig up
something like this...
