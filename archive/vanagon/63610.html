Subject: RE: Vanagon 7 seater camping modification

G'day, 

over the 3yrs i've had a 7 seater, and knowing how easy it is to remove the
centre seat, i've often wondered if some enterprising individual has ever
used this fact to construct a &quot;removable&quot; camping type setup e.g. with
fridge, stove, table, etc.....

I have a hard time commuting with all the westfalia stuff, which is what i
would do for 95% time, before camping.  

Maybe i should just wait until the kids get older, i get older, and buy a
westy. ?
