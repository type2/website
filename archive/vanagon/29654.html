&gt;Did you all figure out what we could throw in our vanagons while i was 
away,
&gt;i may be a prime candidate...


I just bought an '80 Vanagon with a Chevy 2800 V6 and Kennedy adapter.
Am flying to Missouri to pick it up, hopefully Fri., Dec. 1. Will let
you know how it goes if you like.

Third-hand info: Engine turns the same RPMs as the original VW engine,
which is higher than the Chev usually turned in the Citation it came
out of. Shouldn't hurt anything except gas mileage and maybe noise.

Kennedy says that this arrangement can use the stock '80 Vanagon clutch,
but any engine larger than this (they make dozens of adapters) should
have a beefier clutch and throwout bearing, which they also sell.

Kennedy sells only the adapter kits, but not the rear engine mount
bar, radiator, radiator mounts, hoses, etc. You have to get/make these
elsewhere.
