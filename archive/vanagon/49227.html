 Hi Guys,
 My 86 GL's radiator fan is only going on when it's time for the high speed.
 Low speed is not going on at all, not even when the A/C is on.  I have
 checked the 2nd stage relay (good) and the fuse (good).  I haven't made it
 to the fan switch yet.
 
 What else should I check and how do I check it.
  &gt;&gt;
you probably have a bad fan resistor. It reduces the current for the low
speed operation and is prone to failure.  It is located behind the drivers
side headlight assembly.  Replace it quickly and I usually carry a spare.
