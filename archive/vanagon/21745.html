&gt;I have fond winter memories
&gt;of driving with one hand and scraping the inside of the windshield with
&gt;the other.


After buying my first bug in Minnesota, I quickly (like, that very winter)
developed the theory that northern VW drivers have one arm longer
than the other, for the reason you described.

However, I soon recognized a mitigating factor: while most Minnesota
drivers steer with their left hand (easy) while scraping with their right
(hard), they spent equal amounts of time pushing their bugs in winter with
dead batteries, frozen fuel lines, and/or carb ice. Here, they would push
with the left hand (hard) while leaning in the window and steering with
their right (easy). The two effects cancel, thus making northern drivers
look like the rest of humanity.   :^)
