Smko,

TRY http://www.flash_dot_net/~vwcanvas/index.html, with period instead of comma
and the tilde after www.flash_dot_net/

OK?

If not e-mail to me.

Smko,

The address is OK.  I just checked it and logged on to the VW Canvas site.

http://www.flash,net/~vwcanvas/index.html.

Read; http://www.flash_dot_net/~ (this symbol is a tilde. It is next to the
numeric 1 on your keyboard. Hold down the shift key. The character is a
wiggly, on-its-side kind of dash.)vwcanvas/index.html.

Try it again.  If that fails, send an e-mail message to Ernest at
vwcanvas_at_flash_dot_net.

Regards,

&gt; Blaine,
&gt; 
&gt; 1.In my '84, the filler is under the rug to the left of the clutch pedal.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. For tent, etc., try VW Canvas in Texas near San Antonio.  See http:

&gt; Subject: Tents and Washer Bottles
&gt; 
&gt;      Folks-
&gt; 
&gt;      While I'm (still) waiting for replacement owner's manuals to show up
&gt;      at the local dealer, I'm beginning to wonder where the filler for
the
&gt;      front washer tank is hidden.  'Course, if my memory weren't going,
I'd
&gt;      think to ask the dealer when I call to check on the manual - I'm
&gt;      getting ready to leave on a trip and I can just imagine the fluid
&gt;      giving out about 100 mi into it.
&gt; 
&gt;      Also, is it worth asking if there are any Westfalia tents for sale?
&gt;      (Don't laugh me off the list, okay?)  Is anyone making similar tents
&gt;      in North America?  (I know; if it's not on the VW tent page, it
&gt;      doesn't exist, right?)
&gt; 
&gt;      Has anyone had any luck getting a reasonable facsimile made by a
local
&gt;      canvas company?
&gt; 
&gt;      If you see a Silver Westfalia this weekend going through Moab,
Capitol
&gt;      Reef, and around the north end of Lake Powell, honk and wave!
&gt; 
&gt;      -Blaine
