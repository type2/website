Subject:      Recent List Archives

I've seen this question circulate the list, but either I've
missed the answer, or it's gone unanswered:

Where are the recent Vanagon List messages being
archived????

I've been using the halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853 location for
archive searches in the past, but there is nothing there
after August 20, 1997.

Is anyone archiving the list now?

Thanks,
