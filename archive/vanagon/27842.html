&gt; Listen to the man.  And check my posts on 'Useful Tools.'  A lot of FLAPS
&gt; offer the identical set of 3/4&quot; drive metrics for over $150.

Seems I forgot to post a phone # for folks: 1-800-423-2567

little things that are cheap, and might be handy:

15W AC/DC florescent drop light, 00910-1RKB, $9.99
4 pc. adjustable wrench set (6, 8, 10, 12&quot;), 03288-5RKB, $9.99
