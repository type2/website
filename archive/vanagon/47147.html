Subject: FWD: Cali Westies for sale

Listies,

Here are some more California Westies for sale.  I think they have 90% of
them out there.  

I like the guy with the `88 Multivan.  None of that pesky camping equiptment
to hinder your rearward view or weigh down the vehicle.  Ha.

Pass these along    




    
    (California - S. F. Bay area)
    VW - Westfalia, '91,  78k, $22,000,     North bay

       - Options: Conversion / camper, AC, Cass, Cruise, Power, AT
       - Desc: A very clean well maintained van with a new, still under
               warranty, transmission, new brakes, 30k on 80k Michelin
               XVS's. Color: metallic navy. 140 #'s on each cylinder. Last
               serviced 7/18/96 by a factory trained mechanic from germany
               who stated that it is in very good condition and
               mechanically sound. Take it to your mechanic, you won't be
               disapointed. 	Other notible points; This is the multivan
               model. It has the pop-up but not the sink stove and fridge.
               Because of this it seats 7 not 5. And it tends to go through
               fewer brakes and pull hills better because it's lighter.
               Also the bottom bed is not obstructed by a stove, just the
               cupboards that you normally see in these vehicles.
