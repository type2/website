Howdy,

	I put the fridge in the bus today, and made the mods to the bed that
I needed to.  I ended up making totally different mods than I though I
was going to.  I didn't have to drill any metal, but I did have to trim
the box on the bed some.  The nice think was that all of the pieces are
complementary, so switching them around was a piece of cake!

	The fridge nestles in quite tightly next to the bed - can you say
&quot;hair of my chinny chin-chin?&quot;  But it looks good, and I can't wait 
until I get everything else done so I can bolt it all down!

	I now have all major mechanicals replaced/restored.  Except for some
fine tunign and adjusting, that phase is done.  Now I am going to bust
some but and try to get the bodywork done before school starts!  I want
to have everything done body-wise by spring, so as soon as it gets warm I
can paint!

	Once its painted, I'll worry about interior (panels, headliner, carpet,
etc)
