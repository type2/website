&gt; Hi Everyone.  Well, like someone else on the list, I received my VW
&gt; World newsletter (first time I received such a thing after owning new
&gt; VW's since 1988).  The package included Free Internet Access with a
&gt; disk that is setup to use Spry Mosaic/Compuserve.  Interesting
&gt; marketing.  It is setup to automatically link to the VW homepage
&gt; (www.vw_dot_com).  I'm not going to use this product as I have my own
&gt; provider, but sounds like VW is finally getting into some good (?)
&gt; marketing.
&gt;
&gt; I'm going to reformat the disk, and use it for my own stuff.  My
&gt; mother-in-law received the same package earlier this week (1992
&gt; Golf).  She doesn't have a computer.
&gt;

I already reformatted my copy of that disk.  It is nice to see they appear
to &quot;care&quot;, though.  I was a little annoyed at the IBM format.  Don't any of
these people use MacOS?  I've HEARD of IBMs, even seen a couple, but I
can't imagine anybody actually USING one!

Just kidding, I know there are probably a lot of you Bill Gates fans out there!
