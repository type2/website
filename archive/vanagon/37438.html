Subject: RE: More fuel to the fire(was mail header suggestions)


&gt;I think we need to have a printed list(to be kept on our person at all 
time,
&gt;under threat of imprisonment, in a locked room with Steve Maher talking 
about
&gt;his V6anagon ;-))


Hey... what did I do, to deserve getting locked in a room with all you 
guys???

Note that the engine is mentioned only in my .sig-- think how outraged
everyone will be if I actually start TALKING about it!   :^)
