Do not despair, these locks are repairable.-put the key in the lock
-unbolt and remove the whole handle assembly
-locate a small pin (~1/32&quot; dia) at the end of the lock cylinder
-using a drift punch, remove the pin (Kroil may be necessary)
-with the key still in place, remove the cylinder
-move/remove each of the wafers being careful to note their exact
location
-using emery paper clean each wafer and cylinder slot until each wafer
slides smoothly
-test by turning key
-wash thoroughly with varsol (paint thinner) and blow dry (compressed
air)
-reinsert each wafer
-soak overnight in light oil (slick 50)
If you cannot save all the wafers, the lock will still work but not a
secure since other keys have a greater chance of fitting.
