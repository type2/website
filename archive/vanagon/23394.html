Subject: Re: Generator light...meaning?

The following pertains to my '66 Westy.

I've now hooked up a second battery thru a battery isolator and yesterday,
while driving home at night, noticed that my generator light was on  faintly.
Interestingly, it seemed to get brighter when I was stepping on the gas
(while idling).  During the drive home it stayed pretty constant (albeit
faint).

Today, (this morning) I could not detect that it was on (this does not
 neccessarily mean it was off tho due to the ambient light).

I understand that when the light is _ON_, as in very bright, no battery
charging is taking place.  What does it mean when it is a little bit on?

That's actually very common in old buses.  I wouldn't worry about it a bit.
 I think it's just caused by resistance in the wiring--that's a pretty long
piece of wire going all the way to the back of the bus.  It's probably always
flickering faintly, but you just can't see it in the daytime.
