&gt;                 ... I have a similar 
&gt;problem with the  wiper blades skirting or skipping on 
&gt;the very top of their  stroke. I've learned to live 
&gt;with it by driving in the  rain only when I have 
&gt;to....or by keeping my speed down  to 15 mph when I do 
&gt;have to drive in the rain!  ;-)

Not nice.  I bent the arm today, 'coz it seemed like an 
interesting thing to do, and the results were interesting.  
There seems to be a better wiping action but it's not really 
raining.  Just that 'picturesque Irish mist' that foreign 
visitors love and we call 'drizzle'. (... or 'piss'.)

&gt;Actually, where the blades do skip is at the very top 
&gt;of the windshield,  so it doesn't bother me that 
&gt;much...

That would drive me insane.  Get it fixed, Ric!

   SCHPONFIRKLE!!!
