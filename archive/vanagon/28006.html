&gt; Just curious as to what the collective wisdom was as to the mileage
&gt; interval suggested between changing the plug wires, as well as the spark
&gt; plugs themselves. I have been told several different intervals by
&gt; various reliable sources. Anyway, any thoughts????

I have also been told conflicting stories by different people.  On the
bus I usually end up changing wires every other year or so because they 
get greasy, the ends pop off or whatever.  I change the plugs before smog
checks (also every other year).  As a data point, my Mustang, which I
have owned for two years now and driven 40K miles, still has the
original (125K) spark plug wires on it and I haven't changed the plugs
since I got the car.  With the numbers it does at the track I'm pretty
sure there's nothing wrong with them, and it also passed smog easily
despite having two less catlytic converters than it came from the
factory with.  I don't plan on changing the plugs and wires on that car
any time soon.

(p.s. Before anyone flames me, the Mustang isn't running without cats -
it had four and now has two.  :-])
