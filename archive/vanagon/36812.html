Subject: '71 Fuel Guage Replacement

Hey Volks,

Last week I fried some wiring under my dash and lost my fuel guage. It has 
continuity thru the case and blows the fuse when installed (bolt on case thru 
metal backing of cluster) and power is installed. 

So it appears that I need a replacement for this little gem. Since the sender 
is the same for 68-72 (according to &quot;The Bus Stop&quot; catalog)  I would assume 
that all guages for those years are identical. If any one knows the location 
of one I'd be ever so grateful.

Thanks,

Scott
