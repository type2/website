hey Cheese... I once drove my '71 Westy home to Chicago from Columbus, Ohio
with a non-working starter motor, a malfunctioning idle-stop solenoid and
then to add to my frustration the clutch cable broke.  the only problems i
had was when  I approached stopped traffic for road repairs and then when I
got near Chicago at the toll booths.  Mind you I was power shifting, and
operating this Bus with two hands and three feet.  Oh  my brake pedal
started sticking in the depressed position as well so I added a piece of
rope so as I could pull up on the brake pedal after I depressed it.  Yes
indeed I was quite a nervous wreck when I got home.  And you know what? now
that I look back at it, if i were driving anything but a VW, this trip would
have ended in a very large tow bill! Peace. :)
