Subject: more '73 Westy questions

Can anyone tell us how to remove the sink unit 
	with out damaging anything?(we need to fix the floor)

	Where can we find a cushion for the bed that goes 
	over the engine compartment?
	
	Is it advisable to mount the spare tire on the front?

	If so, how hard is it to do this?

	Are 185 75 R14 tires the best for a Westy?

	Are there any general things we should know about Westies?


	Thanks a lot!(in advance)
