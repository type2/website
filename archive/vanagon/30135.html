&gt; &gt;Donno mfg date. I just plug it in over night like you. I have had the fridge
&gt; &gt;short out and drain the cabin battery dead twice. It's bounced back both
times.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I tested it tonight - 1 cell dead, 2 marginal. They're going to replace it
&gt; on Friday.

That's a good point. I should test them my self. We all know that old saying &quot;
if you want it done right.....&quot;

&gt; &gt;left little puddles wherever the cotton ties were touching the inside of the
&gt; &gt;camper. I have resolved to either plasticoat those cloth ties or replace
&gt; &gt;them with a non wicking fabric (nilon?).
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good point. I noticed those ties hanging out. But if you coat the ties
&gt; won't the water just run along the edges? I'll look at seam sealants once
&gt; the weather warms up a bit.
&gt;
I was hoping to get a good seal all the way up to the canvas and possibly
on the outside as well. I plan to try just one side and see if I can find
a good rain storm to test it in again. I have even thought about just using
a waxed cloth of some type. I'll let you know if I am sucessful.

&gt;
&gt; I'll check it out and let you know if I find anything.

I'm very interested in feed back on this settling joint.

&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Egad, drill holes in my pristine van? This is going to be traumatic.

It was!!!!!! I got over it as soon as I saw the awning in it's full regalia.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;I also went camping in Indiana this past summer. I purchased the full screen
&gt; &gt;set. On a hot day in the woods full of bugs I would have given twice their
&gt; &gt;weight in gold to have the full screen set, which I did and hence saved much
&gt; &gt;money. The key to keeping cool in the van is to park the tail end of the van
&gt; &gt;into the wind. I plan to hook up a good size fan this summer that will be
&gt; &gt;solar/battery powered to keep  good air flow on hot days w/o wind.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I suppose those small muffin fans out of a pc case would be useful, but you
&gt; might need a couple. Let me know what you figure out.
&gt;

I already have several 12V fans I had planned to put up in the ceiling vent.
When it's hot you don't want to rely on 1.5&quot; fans to cool the EV. I'm talking
a 12&quot; blade on the fan, artifical wind if you will. I wonder how long the
cabin battery would last then?

&gt; &gt;The rear tent has proven the least useful sofar. First, it's all vertical
&gt; &gt;space. The tent is by no means a water tight tent like the pop top. In the
same
&gt; &gt;rain storm mentioned above I had the rear tent out, big mistake. It leaked
&gt; &gt;water into the rear of the EV on both corners. It is however a nice storage
&gt; &gt;compartment(in good weather) when you want to stow equipment that would
&gt; &gt;otherwise take up valuable indoors realestate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, we'll see how much it is. That is the piece that looked least useful
&gt; to me because I usually have the bikes strapped to the back.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Keep in touch. Us EVers gotta stick together.
&gt;
&gt; I'll say. There sure aren't many of them in Joel's database!

True,t here aren't too many of us now but were growing. From the sales poeple I
have talked to, elderly folks seem to be a prime buyers of EVs. In fact I've
caught several older folks checking out the camper. Somehow they're always
shocked to see a long hair with a tie die getting into the EV. Some won't even
talk to me, and as you can see I love to talk about my VW. Ofcourse I'm not
saying that EV owners are old folks, what I am trying to say is that its
one comfortable ride no matter whos driving it.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Oh, I see the switch problem already - it's been raining like hell here
lately!
&gt; What is a ventshade?
&gt;
A ventshade is the little 1&quot; or 2&quot; wide plastic or metal strip that goes above
the window on the driver and passenger sides of the car that allow you to crack
the window and let air in when it's raining out without letting in the water.
They are usually an after market item. I hope that was a somewhat relevant
description.


speaking of after market items. I have found zero afermarket accessories for
the Eurovan at the shops listed on the net. If you hear of any let tme know.

&gt;
&gt; thanks for the info,
