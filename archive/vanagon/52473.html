Hold on to your sides...

I am looking for an idle stabilizer for an '86.

Now, how much smaller is the list from all those who died laughing?

My local VW dealer quoted me $200 for one.  Since I have no power
steering, or A/C, it doesn't really do much.  Since I already passed smog
(with a loaner) and don't need to pass again, I'm mostly interested in
this for some future need -- like if I ever sell the Kombi.
