Subject: How to check if an engine is ok ?
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 1995 14:54:38 +0200 (MET DST)

	I had a very good day last wednesday as I have finally found and
	bought a 1600 engine for my '71 bus. I had been searching for
	one for almost two months now, so you can probably imagine how
	happy I was when I found it.
	The engine was still in a ('78) bus used by a garage specialised in
	Bugs. I took it for a short drive and listened carefully for
	strange sounds from the engine. Luckily there were none.
	I had a compression check done, and all four had a ratio of 9
	(Bentley says 7.5 so 9 should be ok, right ?).
	Before I put the engine in the '71, what things should I check
	to be sure the engine is ok ?

	For those of you wondering why it took so long, let me just tell
	you that old VW busses are a rarity here in the Netherlands,
	mainly because they all get exported to Africa, Greece, etc.
	So finding a type I 1600 engine for a bus is quite difficult.
	A new engine or just a longblock cost way too much, $2000 and
	$1100 respectively.
