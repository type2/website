Subject: trans mount

Well, I just replaced the shift couple on my '65 deluxe.  I had to sissor-
jack up the transmission inorder to line up the new coupler. Humm....
I didn't think it should have to move so much for alignment.  I lowered the
jack and shifting is really stiff.  The shift rod is bottoming out on the 
guide.  somethings not right.  I think I have a broken front transmission
mount.  Since I don't have a Bentley (but I'm right behind Bentley College)
could someone help me out?  What does the front trans mount look like?
Mines got a rubber mat between two steel plates.  The plate next to the 
transmission is not fixed to the rubber.  I think it should be.  When I 
lower the trans. the plate slides down the rubber mat.  I think my 
transmission is merely leaning against the rest of the mount because it
can't fall lower.  It also explains the weird oscillations I get in low
gears as maybe the trans/engine is bouncing up and down and pulling on
the accellerator cable.  I've lived with this and learned to drive her 
w/o causing this to happen.  Is my front mount busted?  I don't see any
other means of keeping the trans elevated/oriented properly.

I probably should have wiped the grease of my hands before typing this....
