Hi Kids!

Just so you don't load up with too much weight - I thought I'd let you 
all know that the running water at the campsites is safe -  it is 
tested weekly by the Feds. Mammoth's water is some of the purest in the 
state. So, maybe you won't have to schlepp too much of it over the 
Sierra.

Plus, you can but ice at Red's Meadow Resort - about 4 miles from our 
campsite.

MARTHA and the Bay Area convoy group... there is a FABULOUS - FREE - 
Forest Service campground on the west side, on the way into Yosemite on 
Highway 120. It is called &quot;Carlon&quot; and it is about 1/4 mile off 120 on 
Evergreen Road - the road into Hetch Hetchy. Just thinking that you 
could meet Steve and spend Thursday night there. It does not have safe 
running water so you'll need to schlepp it that far, at least. From 
there, your drive to Mammoth would only be about 2 1/2 hours - give or 
take.

Just a thought!  :-)
