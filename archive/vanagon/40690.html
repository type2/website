&gt;experience with this, as it applies to a &quot;catastrophic loss of coolant&quot;
&gt;(split lower radiator hose) at highway speeds.  It would seem that, once the
&gt;coolant is missing from the cooling system, the only thing that the
&gt;temperature sensor has to work with is the air that replaced the coolant as
&gt;a result of the loss.   This resulted in the temperature gauge reading just
&gt;a little of the right of center (normal to warm) while the engine was busy
&gt;burning off any paint and/or oil that may have adhered to its exterior.

I had this appen to an '81 diesel Rabbit.  Lost the lower hose, temp guage
never left center not even after it got so hot that it died.  This was on
I-70 between Columbus and Kirkersville.  Blew the head gasket.  This was at
150,000 miles.  I replaced it and went another 100,000 before I had to
replace it again.
