&gt; &gt; Weekender Eurovans? 
&gt; They did, they don't no more.  8-(
&gt; No it is the Winnebago.  Overheard at the local VW dealer...(I snuck up on
&gt; the mechanic to take a peak at the EV Winnne...) Me &quot;How's it going with
&gt; the Winnebago?&quot;  
&gt; Mechanic &quot;Dammit, these (Winnebago's) are a fucked up piece of shit...&quot;(or
&gt; words to that effect) 

	As an owner of a Winnebago conversion (95 Eurovan Camper), as well
as someone who has worked in the Recreational Vehicle industry designing
travel trailers and van converions, all I can say is that the quoted mechanic
does not know RVs.  Winnebago is an industry leader for good reason and has
done an excellent job in both design and execution on the VW conversion.
