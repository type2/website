Subject: Glad to be back..

Hello Everyone.  After a month's absence from the list, and a 
wonderful vacation, I'm back on the list.  Thanks to Skip Montanaro for 
providing an easy way to follow the postings of this list via his 
&quot;recent archives&quot;  feature.

We spent 16 days in the Canadian Rockies (can't get enough of those 
mountains!).  We started off in Glacier Nat. Park, Yoho Nat. Park,  Banff Nat Park, 
Jasper Nat. Park, and made a trip to Calgary, and checked out 
Alberta's Kananaskis Country.  We did just over 2700 km on that 
circuit.  We had superb weather, and did lots of hiking.  Awesome 
stuff!  Kananaskis Country is beautiful, and Alberta's little secret. 
This is about 1.5 hrs sw of Calgary, and butts up against Banff Nat. 
Park to the north, and Kootenay Nat. Park to the west.  We met up 
with a bear on one of our hikes (black bear) that knew we were around 
with all the noise we were making.  Kind of scarey though.  We saw 
the elk in their &quot;rutting season&quot;  at Jasper Nat Park.  Bull elk were 
10 ft from the van!!  Pretty scarey when you get up in next morning 
and all the trees near the van have been all roughed up, and the van 
wasn't touched!!

We returned home for a week, and then took off to the Okanagan for a 
wine tour for 6 days.  That was very relaxing for us, but the weather 
was a mixed bag.  It was very warm.. temps near 25 C  in the shade, and 
down to 17 C at night.  We did get some very heavy rain, and the 
awning proved invaluable in keeping us dry.  We did just under 1200 
km on that trip.

We saw many older type 2's, mostly Westy's, and not so many Vanagon 
Westy's, and just one Syncro during our travels.  The van performed 
flawlessly, except for a burned out left/rear sidemarker light that 
just went out Saturday.

Glad to be home though, and get back to work (I must be sick??).  The 
van's already washed, detailed, and ready to roll for this 
Thanksgiving long weekend!!

Harry.
