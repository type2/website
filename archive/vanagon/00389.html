Subject:      Re: RE:Busses

&gt;&gt;&gt; The last of the real buses were produced in '67.  Everything
&gt;&gt;&gt; without a split window is a shameless imitation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Moment of silence,  please...)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thom '56 Kombi
&gt;&gt;Does that mean my '91 is a &quot;Tart&quot; or &quot;Hussey&quot;  ;)
&gt;&gt;Steven
&gt;I got to thinkin....if Steven's is a &quot;Tart&quot;, then my Eurovan is
&gt;a Slut. Then I realized that the EV would not like being called
&gt;a Slut. Instead, I took an axe and split its window...now its
&gt;no longer a shameless imitation.

well, i guess my vanagon is just a whore with a heart of gold. :)

joel &quot;just a gigalo ... everywhere i go ...&quot;
