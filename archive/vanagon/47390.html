&gt;Hello List
&gt;  While I like the idea of more power in my vanagon, I want to keep it all
&gt;VW.  I would like to find some information on how to upgrade the 2.1.  I've
&gt;posted before on turbo or supercharging the 2.1, has anyone found any more
&gt;info on this idea?  Forced induction seems to be a good answer for the lack
&gt;of power at the mid and top end of the vans performance.  If anyone has any
&gt;ideas on forced induction or sources of information please e-mail me
&gt;TIA

This has been discussed on the list from time to time and I've thought about
it often.  So far, I've got Nada on reasonably solutions to add power.
 Discussions usually quickly turn to engine swaps.  It seems that there's not
a big enough market for any aftermarketers to bother with anything for a
Vanagon.  I approached Martin Schnieder of MSDS (Vanagon/Porsche engine swap
kit and high-performance exhaust makers) on the idea of making a better/more
powerful exhaust for the Vanagon and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying
there's no market for it.  One big trouble is that to get an adequate market,
you'd need to be able to sell in California, and CA has some nasty &quot;smog&quot;
related regulations.  Basically you can't change anything attached to the
engine (effecting pollution or not) without going through their lengthy
bureaucratic red tape certification machine.  Just getting approved costs a
bundle.  A bundle no one is willing to gamble on the Vanagon parts market.
 :(

I've even thought about adapting a Nitrous Oxide injection system to a
Vanagon.  The trouble is that nitrous systems are designed to deliver their
entire load over just a few seconds.  I'd like to adapt one to &quot;dribble&quot;
nitrous over a 20 minute period so I could get 10-20 more horsepower while
climbing grades, not 150 morehorse power lasting only until I get to the
other side of the intersection!

I know.  It's laughable, but I can dream can't I?
