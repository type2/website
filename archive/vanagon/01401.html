&gt;  
&gt; Now, the more salt the state puts down, the warmer I get.  On
&gt; especially good days I can even have toasted bagels by the time I
&gt; get to school.  Corrosion has become my friend.  It can be your
&gt; friend too.  As an aid to other midwestern VW owners, I am
&gt; willing to sell the complete plans for my &quot;CorrosoHeater&quot; for
&gt; only $49.95.
&gt;  
&gt; Please send payment to billharb_at_macc.wisc_dot_edu
&gt;

Damn!!  I wish they salted the roads here California!!
