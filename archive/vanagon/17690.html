Subject: Re: Vanagon motor replacement

&gt;Anyone had experience replacing the motor in their Circa 87 Vanagon?  I'm
&gt;about to do it.   Just curious if I should expect any hot grounders.  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for whatever info you can provide.
You'd be surprised if you add up all the parts required to do the job
right and then call your VW dealer for a long block,it' not that far off.
