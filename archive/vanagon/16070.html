Subject: GL to Westy Conversion

Well, after my trip I have decided that I would like to deck the 84 GL out, 
so that I don't sleep on the floor again.  I would like to start 
&quot;Westyizing&quot;.  This includes new back seat, cabinets and if possible, the 
pop top. One of my questions is, is it possible to put a poptop on a 
non-westy? If so, are there any *good* places that can do it? (I'd find the 
top, the shop can install it,etc...)  
thanks!

Matt
