&gt;Volkswagen Factory Tool Blowout Sale

So, to understand this list, we first need a Bentley manual to decode it?

Fine... except, uh... which entry is the Bentley manual? And which came
first-- Bentley or the list?

Last time I spent that kind of coin on my '71, it was for tires. Time
before that, more tires. Before that, a master cylinder, shoes&amp;pads,
a LOT of vacuum hose, a check valve, fuel pump, carpet, padding,
insulation, a radio, and a smog test. Between me, the generous people
on this list, and St. Muir, we got it all done chop chop. Haven't needed
Mr. Bentley yet... until now.

Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '71 VW Transporter, non-Bentleyized yet
                              '80 V6anagon, may need Chev shop manual
