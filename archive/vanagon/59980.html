Subject: transmission woes (continued)

ok, earlier I reported that I was having a synch gear problem with
&quot;money pit&quot; 89'westie . My transmission came in fron Transform in Calif.
earlier than expected. You can imagine my excitment..it came in two
boxes. One big and heavy (90lbs) and a 4&quot;x4&quot; 4foot long box..It was
christmas in May...I also found another mechanic that actually owned a
vanagon, it is his wifes and he maintains it for her. This was excellent
news to the one of only 4 vanagon owners on the list for a 350 mile
radius. But as you can imagine the downside is.. he took a look at my
transmission care package and nodded &quot;The repair manual says 12 hours to
change out a transmission&quot; &quot;This one has to be put in with the
modifications, the 4 foot piece is the linkage that replaces the one
UNDER the gas tank, it takes a WHOLE day remove the gas tank&quot; I reeled
in horror as &quot;money pit&quot; looked on &quot;You didnt get the rubber boots
either, I can use your old ones but that would be dumb might as well
replace those since it will be awhile before you come this way again&quot; OK
my inner self was trying to remain calm I recited the &quot;why I want a vw
mantra&quot; &quot;Do you know what causes a synchro gear to go out in the first
place?&quot; he said. I gave him my &quot; I have read the FAQ look and then said
no. &quot;Among other things, slop in the shifter assemblies and worn shifter
bushings&quot; &quot;I'll tell you what bring the van in Monday and Ill check it
out for myself. Im funny this way.. I like to do my own diagnostics and
come to my own conclusions.&quot; Funny I sais I am Computer Tech and I am
funny that same way... So I left his shop with mixed feelings he said
not to send the trans back yet. BUt I can see how much work I could have
saved if I had got an exact replacement. The retrofits might work better
than the original but dang the extra labor charge to install this will
eat me up....the saga will continue monday...

questions)
