&gt;Get hold of Kennedy Engineered Products, in California, (sorry, no number) 

They're in Palmdale, CA at (805)272-1147.  I just (7-29-96) talked to Hobart
Kennedy and Brett Baltau there.  They've been in the VW clutch and engine
swap business since 1968.

&gt;They sell a full kit to fit the Subaru in properly,

This is specifically for the 2.2L engine from 1990 to current.  This engine
is rated at 135HP. You must get the engine, computers and complete wiring
harness from the donor Subaru Legacy.   The kit costs around $1,475. for an
automatic transmission equipped, watercooled  van and includes: instructions,
exhaust header,  miscellaneous coolant plumbing, motor mounts, heat shields,
and instructions to modify the Subaru wiring harness.  Options:  Kennedy
modifying your Subaru wiring harness, add: $280;  Front-filled radiator for
air cooled van: add $300, you still supply most of the other coolant pipes.
 They currently do not have a throttle linkage for manual transmission vans,
but I suspect an order would get them to come up with one.  This kit is made
so that you use your existing catalytic convertor and muffler.  If you care
to fabricate some of the parts yourself, all of the kit's parts are available
seperately also.

&gt; CA smog certified also. 

NOT so.  They're still in the process of getting CARB (CA Air Resources
Board) approval and are having trouble finding the right catalytic convertor.
 When this approval is obtained, the CA kit will require the use of Kennedy
supplied cat and muffler.  This will add approximately $200 to the cost of
the kit.  They'll be going back to the CARB for approval in about one month.

&gt;130HP vs. 95 is pretty appealing. or 155HP from newest Legacy Outback,

I understand the 2.2L is rated at 135HP - more appealing!  They have not done
any work on the newly available (1996) 2.5L, 155HP engine.  They suspect some
changes including changes in the wiring harness.

Regarding Syncros:  Hobart said that he sold a kit to a Syncro owner and the
owner called him back saying that there were problems mounting the Subaru
into the Syncro due to the different spacing between the body and the engine
in the Syncro.  Hobart offered the owner his money back, but the Syncro owner
elected to keep the kit.  Hobart suspects that the Syncro owner adapted
things to work, since he hasn't called back, but he doesn't know for sure how
the Syncro installation worked out.
