Subject:      vintage vw list

someone was asking about the Vintage VW mailing list, so here's the scoop:


to subscribe to the VINTAGVW mailing list,  send mail to

listserv _at_ sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu

with one line of text: SUBSCRIBE VINTAGVW yourfirstname yourlastname

to un-subscribe the list, send a message to the listserv with this text:
SIGNOFF VINTAGVW

to get more information, send a message to the listserv with this tex:
INFO

the list has the ability to be set to DIGEST and NOMAIL, among other options.
-----------------------------------------------------
now, for an opinion: :)
if you can believe it, they have about twice as much mail as the vanagon list.
so you might want to set DIGEST pretty quick.   it's mostly beetles and
karmann ghias.
