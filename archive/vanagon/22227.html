&gt;I just went through that on my 82 Vanagon.  It seemed to me that the bolts
&gt;angle outward somewhat, so even though things may fit OK once they are in
&gt;place, it is almost impossible to get the bolts throught the holes on the

btdt.

This was the worst part of reinstalling a long block on my 1981 Westy.  I
took off the entire exhaust, per Muir, before dropping the engine.  It came
off nicely as one unit.  However, one one side (drivers, I think), things
did not match up on reassembling.  It took me several hours, including much
profanity, before I had managed to get the manifold over the studs.

&gt;From the recent posts, it sounds like a pretty common problem.  Is
redrilling the manifold with larger mounting holes the best way to deal with
this?
