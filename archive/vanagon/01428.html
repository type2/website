 Hi,

&gt; the 10-12 mpg I am getting on a recently (1000 mi.) overhauled
&gt; engine is as pathetic as I think or if it's par for the course.

 A recently overhauled engine would still be a bit tight, yes? So you'd expect
poorer mpg initially. I get 25mpg on the open road and about 20 in town from
my '71 (1600dp) but before you get depressed those are proper imperial gallons
not those weeny US ones :-) so it's 20/highway &amp; 16/city in your language.

 That's not too far adrift if your 10-12 is what you're getting in town. If
you're getting that on the open road, though, it sounds to me like something is
wrong. The first thing I'd look at would be the choke, making sure it was
getting current and that it was doing the right thing with it.

Cheers,
        W.
