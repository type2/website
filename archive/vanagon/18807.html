&gt;From a close examination of the footyprint in the pastry, 't'was not a coon
twas a possum or perhaps possi or maybe the skunk that soiled Argo.

Now about the borscht.  This 'borscht' you speak of is the purple swill that
comes in some sort of Rokeach jar at your favorite Yiddish Deli.  BORSCHT! is
what Martha made with lots of substance, character, heritage, ethnic appeal and
density.  No &quot;girly-man&quot; swill here.  Damn fine stuff and she promised to post
the Nathan's Finest BORSCHT recipe and techniques.

Let's see...First bleed one young camel...acquire significant scrap magnesium...

So what among ye know the incandescence temperature of Mg?
