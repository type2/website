&gt;this is NOT to say that a 1950's car won't last ... just that a 1990's car
&gt;goes a lot longer before the owner HAS to do something to it. the 50's car
&gt;pretty much requires some owner maintenance on a weekly basis. even the 
early
&gt;beetles were DESIGNED this way, i think. you were SUPPOSED to take car of 
your
&gt;car. today, it seems, you are not supposed to do anything.  and they are
&gt;designed so that you CAN'T do anything!

Unfortunately, there is a flip side to this coin., and purchasers of
used cars are getting bit. These electronic-ignition fuel-injected
computer-controlled power-window toe-alignment-only cars that most
manufacturers produce nowadays, are almost impossible to diagnose when
they finally DO break down. And, parts costs can sometimes be incredible,
in ways that 50's mechanics never dreamed of.

Had an '80 Toyota Cressida wagon, that had a noticable hesitation when
started from a standing stop. Gas mileage was deteriorating, too.
Checked the spark, sorta orange. Replaced plugs, cleaned ignition, no
change. Replaced plug wires, no change. Coil, no change. Did the fuel
injector cleaner trick three different ways, gas mileage improved slightly,
then went back downhill. Air filter, fuel filter, fuel pump, no change.
Costs are up around $300 so far, and zero results. Finally replaced
all six fuel injectors, at $160 a pop, and it ran beautifully.

All  these things were at the recommendation, one at a time, of two
different Toyota dealers and an independent Toyota repair shop. Point is,
even those guys had no way of diagnosing bad fuel injectors, short of
replacing them and seeing what happens.

A year later, it conked out cold at an intersection, and wouldn't start
to save me. Spark seemed OK, fuel OK, compression OK, battery/cranking
system OK, but no varoom, or even a little chug.

Finally traced that one to a faulty &quot;ignitor module&quot;, a little metal
box that sits under the coil. Dealer item only: $300! Got a used one
at a junkyard, but the car was never reliable after that.

The Cressida is a wonderful car: Powerful, quiet, smooth. But I'll never
buy another used one, unless it's '79 or '78, which had a carb and a point
ignition.

VW Content: How many people have ripped the fuel injection system out
of their Type 3's and '75-later Type 1's, and replaced them with carbs?
A LOT, and for good reason. When they crap out, they can make your life
miserable, and there's no way you can diagnose those either.

&quot;Planned obsolescence&quot; used to refer to poorly-designed American car
bodies (I should know-- I have a '66 'Stang). Now, it's moved under the
hood of nearly every car on the road IMHO. These cars are wonderful when
they're new, and they DO last a lot longer before you have to do serious
repairs. But once you get to that stage, better buy your own garage
complete with TONS of electronic diagnostic equipment-- or just throw
the car in the trash can.

Thank gawd the V6anagon has a Holley and simple vacuum electronic ignition,
instead of the original Chev injection and computer ignition module.
I'd rather look forward to the certainty of bribing an emissions guy every
two years, and a carb rebuild every four, than the uncertainty of wondering
if I will abruptly lose all fuel, or spark, in Podunk Nevada, and just have
to park it and walk away.
