They have a reputation for alright prices and sending you the 
wrong part pretty often.

I ordered from them twice.  they got the order wrong once, the 
first time I ordered the mats that say Vanagon on them, very nice.

&gt;has anyone used Partsplace to order parts? my roommate has a catalog and i just
&gt;ordered some parts that i desperately need to get on the road. i'm hoping they
&gt;have a good reputation..would like to hear what folks have to say about them.
&gt;after buying a cvjoint that was RUSTED on the inner case from the local vw shop
&gt;here and being told 'that you don't know what you are doing...&quot; and fighting
&gt;to get my money back, i'm hoping i won't get ripped again.
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
