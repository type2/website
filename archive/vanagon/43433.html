&gt;Hey Eric and Maggie,
&gt;
&gt;        I think I have the same problem.  I have a 78 VW Westy, 2000 cc as
well.
&gt;It seems to be coming from above the oil filter bracket. I am no
professional, but I think mine might be coming from the gasket attached to
the oil filter bracket. Or, it may be coming from the oil cooler gaskets.  I
tried to take the oil filter brakcet off to change the gasket to change it,
but i couldn't access the bolts.  Next weekend I am going to remove the fan
housing to get at it.  I should be able to remove the oil cooler too (if
necessary).  Other people on the list have told me that it could be coming
from the oil pressure switch, but I haven't checked that yet. 
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck and please email me if you figure it out (cause it may be my
problem too), or if you have any tips, or if you have any problems. I'll
email you with the results of my surgery next wkn'd.
&gt;
&gt;Adam Webb 
&gt;78 Westy
