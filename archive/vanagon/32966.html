Subject: type 1&amp;4 with 'loaf tranny

List,
Just to recap what I think has been said about various transmission/engine 
combinations on the 'loafs - '68 &amp; on:

The mainshaft on the type 4 matched tranny is 18mm longer.

The '73 and up tranny has better gear ratios, i.e. less rpm at cruise.

You can use a type 4 tranny ('72 &amp; up) with a type 1 engine, but not a type 
1 tranny ('68-'71) with a type 4 engine cause it will trash the pilot bearing.

This is important 'cause I have a '71 tranny that I wanted to use in a '73 
bus.  Now my understanding is that this wouldn't be recommended.

Thanks for any info.

Dean
