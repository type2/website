   Drew,
     Try this. Get it to a &quot;unlocked position&quot;. Then disconect and
     plug the vacuume line in the engine compartment. If it stays in the 
     unlocked position the problem is the valve in the dash. I think
     thats where your going to find the problem. The axuator it self is
     spring loaded, therefore with out vacumme, the axil, would not engage.
      &gt;&gt;


A leaky diaphram in the actuator can also cause this problem.
