To All;

Saturday i made a 3 hour drive to my friend Sjoerd, in
Friesland, the Netherlands. Sjoerd is a cool guy. I wanted
to buy a bug, but he had nothing interesting for me, all
bugs (25 or so) were '75&gt;'83 Mexico Bugs with lots of rust
and no charisma. He had a *nice* orange '75 panel, 1600, all
original, always stored in a garage, 45.000 KM,
*absolutely* flawless interior. Drives like new, (tested
it myself :) He askes 5500 Dutch Guilders (_at_1$=1.65Guilder)

As i was looking in one of his barns i saw a CT engine, used
in May'79&gt;Dec'82 Transporters, 1584cc, 50HP (37Kw) It's based
on the T1/T3 case, AS41 casting, it has factory HYDRAULIC LIFTERS
and an OILFILTERMOUNT cast into the left casehalf, next to the
oilpump, above the rear pressure-relief-valve (only one), parallel
to Cyl #4, slightly angled downward. (!!! :) )

I bought it for 75 Guilders, a shortblock with cylinders, fan-
shroud and oilcooler.

The fanshroud looks like a T4 unit but is made of pressed steel
instead of magnesium. It has a O-ringed dipstick hole and the
T3 oilfiller opening. No boss or stud to mount a regular thermostat,
on this engine it's bolted to the oilfiller opening studs. The crank
mounted fan hub can be replaced by a regular crankshaft poully. On
the other side of the crank it has four dowels and a glandnut,
identical to the upright engines. Dono the size of the flywheel, i
don't have it. The opening for distributor, fuelpump and generator-
stand are all there, only the generatorstand studs are 6mm instead
of 8mm as we're used to, they only have to hold a plastic, O-ringed
breather tower, similar to the T3 engine. The lifters slide in
from the pushrod side, they are about 2.5&quot; long and have a
oilgroove of approx. 3/4&quot; wide. I don't have the pushrods &amp; tubes.
Cam lobes are narrower than the regular upright cam.
The oilpump is identical to the 70s 1600s. The three holes for
the rear enginemount are there, but the mount itself is different
ofcourse. The case has some additional mountbosses and webbing
cast on on the rear, looks a bit T4, i'm gonna remove this (not much
and very thin) and drill 'n tap 2 6mm holes for the regular poullytin
since i want to build it up as a regular upright engine with FACTORY
hydraulic lifters AND oilfilter. The oilcooler mount is moved :( ,
about 2, 3 inches to the rear, i'm gonna use a doghouse oilcooler in
a non-doghouse shroud, i only need to modifie the fanshroud a bit so it
fits over the cooleradaptor. It has the usual sumpscreen as well, no
drainplug in the plate. I found the famous T3 CoolTins under the
cylinders but they have a new partnumber, maybe the're different,
haven't compared them yet. If you look into the cylinder openings of a
regular upright you'll see the mainbearing-case-webbing (donowatucalem)
these have hollow spots in them, the CT case has these filled in. It's
NOT deepstudded, but it does have 8mm headstuds with casesavers.

It's strange i didn't spot these engines before, i knew there was such
a thing as a 1600 Transporter/Vanagon but never gave it a glance.
Most VW lecture/info i read is from US origin, so if this engine never
came to the US, how would i know?  :)


Cheers!

Brian.
