&gt;Anyone know what's need to make that jump seat fit in the middle 
&gt;section of my Westy, that is, behind the passenger seat? 

you need the steel bracket that gets welded or screwed to the
passenger-side wheel well (the one that the jumpseat latches on to).
You'll also put two half-inch inside diameter holes in the floor and
have some kind of rings (washers?) welded on them, so the two feet of
the jumpseat stay firm.

&gt; 
&gt; On a similar note, can the middle bench seat from a regular Vanagon be fit 
&gt; into a Westy?  At quick glance, it looks like the middle seat tracks might 
&gt; still be under the Westy carpet. But I'm not sure if the bench seat is too 
&gt; long to fit between the sink/stove cabinet and the sliding door.  If it did 
&gt; fit, you could just clamp it in when you needed 2 extra seats, and pull it 
&gt; out relatively easily when you needed the room instead, just as in a 
&gt; regular Vanagon.  Then again, I've never seen it done before in a Westy, 
&gt; which might be indication that it doesn't fit.  Has anybody tried it or 
&gt; measured it?

I have done this -- I do have a middle bench seat that I use in the
'82 Westy (that I used to use for daily taxiing purposes, before the EV
and the '87).   It fits just right, I had to istall the fixtures for
the bolts on the floor.  You cannot open the Refrigerator door while
it's there.  Another idea is installing it backwards, against the two
front seats.  You get some access to refrigerator door (does not open
fully).  But you lose the flexibility of access from front to back.

Hope this helps.
