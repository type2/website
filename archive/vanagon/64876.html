&gt; My local dealer, Metro VW, in Dallas, TX replaced all the leaking fuel
lines on
&gt; my '86 GL (150K at time) both in the engine compartment and over the tank
&gt; without charge.   The service manager told me that VWoA had an advisory
to
&gt; dealers to fix any and all fuel leaks on any and all VWs! Ya'll might
want to
&gt; look into it.
&gt;
&gt; BTW: I have heard that (in short) the new *reformulated* fuels are
causing fuel
&gt; lines designed for the *original* ;) fuel formula to break down.
&gt;
&gt; Also, the same dealer replaced my rear heater core last winter at no
charge
&gt; under a similar directive by VWoA.

&gt; &gt;I just wanted to report to the group a success! My fuel tank no longer
leaks
&gt; &gt;when full. But let me tell you, it is not a fun time doing the repair.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I went to the dealer (who knew the parts to replace from memory - if
that
&gt; &gt;tells you anything) to get the parts.  I wanted to replace everything if
I
&gt; &gt;were going to the effort of pulling the tank, so about $45 later I left
with
&gt; &gt; 4 seals the crossover vent tube. The parts guy suggested using a
&gt; &gt;transmission jack to raise and lower the tank.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, let me tell you, dropping the tank is not the problem so much as
how VW
&gt; &gt;chose to route the vent tubes and the general lack of clearance. It also
&gt; &gt;gives you a chance to find out first hand how much dirt collects in the
&gt; &gt;valley in the middle of the tank. Usually while on your back wrestling
the
&gt; &gt;tank out and looking up. (wear goggles)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I also replaced the cloth covered hoses to the vent tanks with
fuel-injection
&gt; &gt;hose and replaced all the clamps with fuel-injection clamps. (Being
&gt; &gt;determined to erradicate all leaks.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The worst part was putting the tank back in because you have to route
the
&gt; &gt;crossover vent tube OVER all sorts of plumbing, wires and cables. I am
&gt; &gt;convinced that black-forrest elves with long, thin arms did this job at
the
&gt; &gt;factory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It was an interesting way to spend a day. It took me two days to get the
&gt; &gt;courage to fill the tank up - because I would have gone insane at the
thought
&gt; &gt;of having to do it again if it still leaked. So far - no leaks!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For those of you considering it, it is not a job for someome without
long
&gt; &gt;arms and patience. &lt;g&gt;
