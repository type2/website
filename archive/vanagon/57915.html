Subject: 87 Wolfs. Power Door Locks.
Date: Wed, 2 Apr 1997 14:21:21 -0800

Well, I worked on the power door locks during my lunch.  I moved the
'motor' from the passenger side door into the driver side door, put in a
20Amp fuse and to my amazement it works! ! !  I can now lock the sliding
door &amp; the hatch.  Now all I have to do is locate a used 'motor' (the
dealer price for a replacement, I'll have to save $$) for the passenger
side.  Thanks for all of your suggestions.  This list is a god-send of
useful information. 

Durby.
