Subject: Re: FS:  '89 Westy at 200% profit!!!


&gt;I'd just like to remind you all that 2 or 3 weeks ago we were notified 
&gt;about a similar (then bargain) Westy FS, then warned off it once
&gt;the details became known!!  Remember that now?  It was the salvage titled
&gt;Florida saltwater flood rightoff, flooded above the floor, hence above
&gt;engine and trans.  If the current seller, Mr Salmon, has anything he'd 
&gt;care to add to this let's hear it.  Maybe it's not the same vehicle? 
&gt;(hah!).
&gt;Those of you who think I'm trampling on the sacred toes of 'a regular 
&gt;business deal' can just PO on this one!  Let the flames begin!!!
&gt;Tim, (highly steamed again)


Highly steamed but completely wrong.

It's not the same vehicle.  That was a blue Westy with 87k miles, in need 
of a lot of work.  This is a white Westy with 102k which has never been in 
an accident, much less a flood.  I drove it most of the way here myself 
after buying it from the original owner in Missouri.  It's never even been 
in Florida.

Care to apologize, Tim?
