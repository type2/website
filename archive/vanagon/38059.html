Subject:       questions on temp gauges

I have a '72 with the standard T4 1700 engine.  I was wondering first 
of all, where is the predrilled mounting spot on the heads for a temp 
sensor?  When i got the bus it had a non functioning cyl head temp 
gauge.  It turns out that the power and everything is hooked up to it 
and if i ground out this one haging wire it pegs the needle.  There 
may just be a sensor back there some where.  Aside from that, I was 
wondering how much setups for  cyl head temp
                               oil temp  and 
                               oil pressure
                                              would cost and the best 
way/place to install that pressure sensor.
Thanks.
Ed.
