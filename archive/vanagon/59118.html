Date: Tue, 29 Apr 1997 20:56:27 -0400

My friend and partner-in-crime, Jon Lukens, who runs The Bus Depot's
service department (actually a separate entity from my Parts business), is
trying to promote his new business, and asked me to notify the list about
his Wasserboxer Head Gasket service.  

The price of $999 includes all of the following parts and labor:
	Remove engine
	Inspect clutch components
	Glass bead heads
	Lap valve seats
	Remove &amp; inspect pistons and liners
	Hone cylinder walls
	Replace all cylinder seals
	Install new German head gaskets
	Install new water pump
	Bleed cooling system and add phosphate-free coolant
	Oil change and filter

In addition, the following can be added if needed:
	New Sachs clutch kit (disc, pressure plate, throwout bearing):  $125
	New German piston rings:  $89
	Pistons &amp; Cylinders:  $299-499 (varies by eng size &amp; country of origin) 
	Heads:  $239 each rebuilt, or $399 new (German VW 2.1L heads)   (exchange)
 
The shop is located in Perkiomenville, Pa., about an hour from Philly, 1/2
hour from Allentown, 2 hours from Baltimore or NYC, etc.    Jon's direct
phone number is  (215) 234-0890.
