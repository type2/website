Subject: Westphalia Top Speed

     
     I have been test driving various vanagons/westphalias with both auto and 
     manual transmissions and different model years, lately, and I am trying to 
     evaluate whether performance is up to spec or not.
     
     Seems like top speed under standard conditions would be a good indicator of 
     power output.
     
     Does anyone want to share information on their Westphalias' top speed? by 
     engine size and trans configuration?
     
     Thanks,
     
     Pat S.
