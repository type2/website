Subject: Tune Up


I was wondering if anyone knew of a list of things to have done for a 
tune up.  I have a 1980 Westy with an aircooled engine.  I just wanted 
some guidelines to go by when looking for a good mechanic.  If anyone 
knows a basic list of things that need to be checked, changed, or 
replaced every once and a while, it would really help me out.

Later,

	Kyle
