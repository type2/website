&gt; One quick question.  I'm slowly building my collection of tools.  As I go to

&gt; the car jack while I work on it, or do I need to get an axl stand?  BTW, is
&gt; axl the correct spelling?  What an odd looking word.

Tim,

Use a jack stand, it's much safer, place it under the frame. 

Also, axle has the e on the end (I had to look it up to make sure)
