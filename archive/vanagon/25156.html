Subject: 1965 Type II questions

I am looking for the following parts for my 1965 panel van, please e-mail
me privately if you have any parts or you can answer my questions.

Here is what i need

1. &quot;correct&quot; engine lid for 1965 van (does anyone know what years of engine
lids are &quot;correct&quot; and interchangeable?? I could use two of these lids IN
GOOD CONDITION puh-leasse no rusted out dented up ones ( i already have
those ;)
ideally the engine lids would be pearl white and velveet green - i know i
know i am being picky, but i though i might as well ask

2. correct set of cargo doors for panel van w/ minimal rust (i.e. no
windows cut in)

3. maybe a rear apron for a 65 van (take note that the engine lid opens
with a church key not a push button, so the apron has to be of a 65' or
older vintage)


Also has anyone ever seen a non-walk thru panel van that *didn't* have the
extra two or three cargo ventillation louvers above the usual engine
cooling lovers?? Mine doesn't and it appears that it came from the factory
that way??

michael
