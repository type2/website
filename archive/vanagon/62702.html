&gt; I'd like to hear from list members who have any experience painting with
&gt; the high-volume-low-pressure (HVLP) non-compressor sprayers.  I mean the
&gt; kind that have an electric powered turbine, large diameter air hose, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of years ago, before the list was split to Vanagon and air-cooled,
&gt; I thought someone posted their story about using one of these to
&gt; (economically) paint their van.  I recall some talk about buying a
&gt; reconditioned unit from the Damark catalog for $100-$200.  My search of the
&gt; archives turned up nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; My friend, John Hess, wants to paint his Dormobile and he is considering
&gt; this method.  Any info.on this would be much appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Volks!
