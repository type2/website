&gt; Looks like I'll be putting in a new engine in my Vanagon camper. It ate the
&gt; lifter-left a nasty hole inside case in cylinder #1. Looking for a rebuilt
&gt; engine or good used engine. Need info on who to buy from. Want good solid
&gt; rebuild at reasonable cost and any and all info, rumors, praise, gripes about
&gt; various rebuilders and/or suggestions for a novice at this. Don't know if my
&gt; old case is re-useable. I live in the San Francisco Bay area (North).
&gt; Dealers I know of so far:

I'll throw in GEX they got the water cooled but their price is
always much higher than everyone else, about $2100 for a Wasserbocer
I think, but have never heard a bad story about one of their engines
and was quite happy with a hydraulic lifter 2.0 liter type IV from
them myself.  You get what you pay for, I imagine this goes doubly
so for wasserboxers though I admit those ad's for $1400 with new
liners pistons bearings, etc from a couple people in Hot VW's are
impressive.
