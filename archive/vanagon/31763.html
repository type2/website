Subject: more on Pfeiffer


It seems that Pfeiffer coming up so soon has caught some of you by surprise.  We
lost a few, but we also gained a few (see roster below).

Notes:  above all:  bring firewood.  As much as you can pack!
Food:  bring sturdy appetizer stuff to share - 2 types per person per
       evening out to get us thru.
Also:  bring picnic chairs, ice, yer-own-whatever-u-drink/do, and stuff to
       burn/ignite/explode/hallucinate over/etc.

Location - be careful!  In this area (about 30 minutes south of the Carmel-
Monterey area), there are other places with the name &quot;Pfeiffer&quot; on them, 
such as Pfeiffer-Burns, etc.  We are going to something which is called

Pfeiffer Big Sur.  Make note, as there must be a dozen places to camp in
there.  This is a state park.  It's on the east side of Highway One.

THIS WEEKEND!  See you there!
