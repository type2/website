Hello all.  I am on a quest for those that have had problems 
installing seals in the sides of your tranny.  Mine is a '71 but I 
think they go in the same at least through '79.  The part number 
changed somewhere in there and the seal itself changed 3mm in 
diameter.

I say this because I want to clarify that I don't have the wrong seal.
3mm is big enough to be noticed.  That said, I can't get the seal 
back into the thing.  I had two ordered since one side was leaking.  
Both of those are now gone.  I have tried using one big socket, a 
washer/socket combination and the small taps with a hammer method.  I 
froze the seal thinking I could shrink it just enough.  No dice.  I 
now have four of those seals ordered hoping I get one of them in 
there.  The most recent advice I have gotten is to soak the seal in 
some hot water in hopes of softening the rubber just enough that it 
will squeeze in there.  I will try that first when the next batch of 
seals arrives.  If that doesn't work I am down to removing the thing 
and using a press.  Oh, the seals are 'elring' or some such.  They are
supposed to be OEM.  Thanks, Jim
