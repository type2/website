Subject: Catalytic Rattling

I have a feeling the catalytic converter has broken loose and is 
rattling around in the muffler assembly. I had heard this noise 
before but now I'm experiencing a loss of power and a deeper lower 
sound when acelerating. Can the muffler and catalytic converter 
effect the aceleration? Is the O2 sensor able to act correctly in 
this situation and will fixing this be likely to improve my gas 
mileage as well? Thanks for any advice,
