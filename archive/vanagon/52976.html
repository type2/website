Subject: VW VANAGON

     I am interested in getting on your mailing list.  I have a 1985 Vanagon.
 I am rebuilding the engine and I would welcome some technical insights into
procedures, tools to use, pitfalls, things to be careful with, etc.  

     If you are not the right place to look, would you put me in touch with
another source?  Thanks.

                            Russell Gunter
