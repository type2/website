Gerry comforts:
&gt; No one's ganging up on you.  We both have manual transmissions.
&gt; You said you thought the cruise was worthless with the Automatic and the 
&gt; 1.9 Litre, right?  I just wondered whether it was because of power or 
&gt; because of inability to hold a steady speed or because it tended to shift 
&gt; while cruising or what. 

okay, a bit of seriousness.  but just a bit.  the cruise on my 1.9 
seemed to suffer from a lack of vacuum-- 'cause i could go up the 
inclines by mashing the accelerator to the floor (and being pushed 
into the seat cushion by the G-Force).  it's as if the vacuum 
actuator didn't 'suck down' the throttle enough.

now i have a 2.1L with a manual and gobs of relative power-- but 
ain't got no cruise  :(   

joel, is there a song in here??  its got all the requisites... sex 
power and cruise.
