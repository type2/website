&gt;So, I need to acquire chains for my &quot;new&quot; 2wd '87 Vanagon with the 205/70
MXL
&gt;tires on steel wheels.  I noticed that the Owners Manual said that there is
&gt;insufficient clearance in the wheel wells for chains when the 205/70 tires
&gt;are fitted.
&gt;Has anyone tried this?  What about cable chains vs. regular chains? 

I've used two varieties of cable chains on the 205/70 tires and also on the
27LT14-8.5 light truck tires and didn't have a problem.  I think the smallest
clearance area is on the front inner part of the tire where it come within
about 1/2&quot;-3/4&quot; of the suspension piece.
I think that a store selling tires would let you try them on to assure a good
fit.
