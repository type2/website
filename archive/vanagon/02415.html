oh, you know ... i'll bet that page is missing from your owners' manual!
on the 1980-1983 air-cooled vanagons, the anti-freeze/coolant tank is
hidden waaaaay up above the spare tire, up in the middle of the dash.
it's only used by the engine during extreme stress and heat, so you hardly
ever need to change it ... and it never boils over. costs a lot of money
to have it fixed, too. :)

&gt;test, change if necessary. $20 for Volkswagens. (This was in 1977, before

no, but we charged $30 to change the radiator in beetles. ;)
