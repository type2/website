&gt; I bought the VW/Audi microfiche today (well, I'll get them Monday).  I'm

&gt; the phone (the stack is about 5 inches tall).  The parts manager rattled
&gt; off the models and years covered and it sounded good to me.  He was firm
&gt; on his price, so I agreed to the $100 value.

material, and you'll never run out of friends eager to prise them away for a 
time.  Use them well.
