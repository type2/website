Greg Asks.....

&quot;Do I have to register as an RV camper?&quot;

When I signed up they did not ask me what kind of car I had.
Since signing up I have had both the 65 and the 68 flatbedded home the day I
bought them.
I have AAA PLUS and its worth the money as far as tows and dead batteries go
..

68 Westy
65 Campmobile (soon to be parting out.....)
