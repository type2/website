Subject: Re: I'm buying a westy interior!

I thought I'd offer my experience putting a westfalia interior in a
vanagon.  I bought the 82' diesel with 18k on a Canadian factory rebuilt
for $3200 in 1992.  I bought the full Westfalia interior from a wrecked 89
for $1050.  That included all cabinetry, rear seat and rear bed pad,
propane tank and regulator, interior body panels, and plates so front
seats rotate. 

The overhead cabinet in the rear I had to mount with a bolt drilled 
through the body in the air vent area on the passenger side.  I was 
advised by a trailer/RV supply place that the three black plastic gizmos 
for water, electricity and ? were pretty cheap.  So I installed heftier 
components.  I'll never again be afraid of taking a drill and sabresaw to 
the immaculate body of a car.  It was difficult though.  The measure 
twice, cut once credo became, measure ten times, think the whole thing 
through again, remeasure cabinets, then think some more.  

I installed new carpet and pad after drilling all floor holes, installed 
insulation behind &quot;ALL&quot; interior body panels, installed curtains on 
springs tensioned from screws I put in, both top and bottom.  I installed 
lights in strategic locations.  It took two weekends and a couple hours a 
night after school for a couple weeks to install all this.  

What really helped was helping the two guys from Carter Volkswagen in
Edmonds, Washington take the stuff I bought out of the wrecked vanagon.  I
took detailed notes about where to put what in what order when.  After
this, there was very little mystery in the process.  I took almost exactly
four hours to gut the Westy.  Now if I can only get that 67 bus sitting 
dead in someone's garage getting moldy.  Next time I'm going to build the 
interior from scratch...

A note:  When my paramour and I split up I could only get $3800 for the 
vehicle.  Diesels...
