Subject: SW Bug-In III this weekend (Phoenix)

Here is the information for those folks who missed it or need it again:

Several requests for information has been passed toward VanBondo regarding
the Southwest Bug-In III. Here's the scoop.

What:  Southwest Bug-In III a *VW ONLY event*
Where: Phoenix Raceway Park, Phoenix, Arizona USA. (roughly)
       Specifically closer to the cities of Peoria and SunCity West.
When:  October 20th, 1996
Weather: FINALLY cooling off! It will be *down* to a teeth chattering 88 degrees
         and full sunshine (Ooooh, break out the flannel!) ;-)

Directions: Phoenix Raceway Park is located approximately 10-12 miles 
  northwest of Sun City West on Grand Avenue as you head out toward 
  Wickenburg, Arizona.

  *From Los Angeles: I-10 toward Phoenix until you reach 105th Ave.
   or 99th Ave. Watch for the signs for &quot;Sun City.&quot; Procede north on either 
   99th Ave. or 105th Ave. to the three way intersection of Bell Rd., 99th Ave.,
   and Grand Avenue. Take Grand Avenue toward Wickenburg. Drive about 10-12
   miles while watching for hoards of VWs (Phoenix Raceway Park) on your left.

  *From Albuquerque, Flagstaff etc: Take I-17 south from Flagstaff all
   the way to Bell Road (West) exit. Procede on Bell Rd. to the three way
   intersection of Bell Rd., 99th Ave., and Grand Avenue. Take Grand Avenue
   toward Wickenburg. Drive about 10-12 miles while watching for hoards of 
   VWs (Phoenix Raceway Park) on your left.

Specifics: PRA Sanctioned Drags, Show, Swaps, etc. Many categories for the show.
Cost: (I think) $10.00 per person for spectators. Sorry, but I don't know
specifics of swap spaces and drag fees.

More Info: (602)278-VWVW aka (602) 278-8989.

This is supposed to be shaping up to be a great show. The promoter is still
recieving calls from all over.
