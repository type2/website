Subject: Re: Splittie with wrong size wheels


&gt;&gt;Also, on another splitte (don't know the year on this one), it had 16&quot; 
(!!)
&gt;&gt;wheels. Was this standard on ANY year older bus, or did the PO get
&gt;&gt;fancy???
&gt;==
&gt;Please send me the name and phone number of the current owner, as these 
were
&gt;sold on barndoors,  also split window bugs (differnt styles)

Well, it definitely wasn't a barndoor. I was ignorant back then, but
not *that* ignorant-- it was a '66 vintage or so. Besides, the guy I
sold it to was a complete jerk (stole my hibachi) with whom I have
not kept up these many years.

Were the bolt patterns the same between 16&quot;-wheel barndoors, and regular
14&quot;-wheel splitties such as a '66? Maybe the guy *I* bought it from (got
it free, actually, sans engine) had the 16&quot; wheels sitting around and
didn't know what to do with them, so bolted them to this bus?
