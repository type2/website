&gt; Hi, I'm Alan Loo, I own a 87 Vanagon, and I live in Northern California.

Hi Alan,

Well Northern Cal is REAL specific... ;)  C'mon, give us a clue.  Can
you here the ocean in your vicinity?  Have you felt any earthquakes
lately?  Is watching the grass grow your kind of excitement?

I'm in Sacramento.  Can you tell us where your at?  ;)
