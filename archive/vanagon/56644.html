Subject: Follow-Up - Tires for VW Buses

There seems to be some questions regarding some of the survey fields ....

  O  Rim information - Rim width has a bearing on tire performance, but I doubt that
     most owners know how wide their rims are, so I left this off.

  O  Definition of subjective terms
     - WEAR: How long your tires will last before you have to replace them because
             they are worn out?  Are you happy with how long they will last?
     - TRACTION:  How good is your traction in rain, snow, mud, ..., etc.?
     - RIDE:  Different tires have different ride characteristics, some are soft and
              compliant, ..., some are hard and responsive.  Just let us know how you
              like the ride of your tires.
     - HANDLING: How responsive is your tires to cornering, parking, braking, ...., etc?
     - NOISE:  Tires create noise and transmit noise while rolling.  Are you happy
               with the amount of noise your tires produce?

    When tires are designed, engineers have to create a good balance with the above
    factors.  For example, a tire that lasts a long time typically has poor traction.
    A tire that has good handling usually has a harsh ride.  We are looking for the
    tires that go too far one way or the other.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
