&gt; How would I spot a pancake motor vs. an upright motor if i was looking 
&gt; at the crank case broken down and the cylinders lying on 
&gt; a table next to it?

The pancake motor case is aluminum, the upright is magnesium.
The pancake motor case has mounts for the oil cooler in the rear, the
	upright has the mounts in the front (FIF).
I'm pretty sure the oil breather is different, but I don't know the
upright motor well enough to describe the difference.
The oil cooler mounts are the dead giveaway, although there are many
less obvious differences.
