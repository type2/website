Subject: Re: Need price advice on EVs

Both of them sound dirt cheap... I wonder if either suffers
the piston slap problem.

to get an idea, do this:
1) do not mention the shop people that you heard of the 
   piston slap problem until you do steps 2-?
2) go there first thing when they open in the morning
   (the colder the better)
3) ask them to start the vehicles up, one by one.

4) the piston slap problem is audible for about
   20-30 seconds from a cold start.  It is an
   unmistakable diesel engine sound coming from
   a gasoline engine.  If you hear it, it is very
   likely the engine is suffering from the piston slap
   problem.  Piston slap shortens engine life.

5) ask for a real diagnostic:  take the cylinder head off
   and and check the cylinder walls.  In most cases that
   I know of, VW of America has paid for necessary repairs,
   including mine.  The new engine they put in, by the way,
   has been trouble-free for (almost) 30,000 miles now 
   (the original engine started showing symptoms at 12,000
   miles, and was at 18,000 miles when I convinced our
   dealer to take the cylinder head off and diagnose it
   for sure).
I have raved (as well as others on the list) about our EV
frequently, we love it.
