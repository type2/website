Subject: BN4 Heater in Vanagon - Is it possible?

I have an 85 Vanagon Westfalia, and have the opportunity to get a BN4 
heater out of a 73 Westfalia.  It is complete and almost in new 
condition. 

What I want to know is if there has been any successfull installations 
of a BN4 Heater into the Vanagon Camper before I enter into 
negotiations to purchase this heater.

I suppose it could go under the back seat but I would prefer to get it 
outside of the cab.  Are there any thoughts about slinging underneath 
like the propane tank?  Or mounting overtop of the transmission against 
the front wall?  Engine compartment (with modifications)? Has it ever 
been done?
