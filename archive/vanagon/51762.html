Subject: Re: 87 water pump

Thanks to everyone for their advice concerning the water pump and what
to expect when it does finally give.  

I don't really know if it's original or not (Joel didn't think it was
with 131K).  I bought the Vanagon at 80K in Jan 95.  It had a new engine
put in then (new/rebuilt from VW).  The mechanic I brought it to for a
pre-purchase inspection cussed the dealer out for replacing the engine
and none of the periphenalia.  He said that the water pump should have
been replaced while they were in there redoing everything.  Thus my
assumption that it was original.

Nice to know also that I can do it myself without worrying about AC. 
Going to be doing everything myself from here out.  Even going to change
the oil myself (first time in my life) after I chase the grimlins away
(other post).

Thanks again everyone--you're support and advice are REALLY appreciated!
