Well, Larry, if we apply a cubic spline to the bar graph in your first 
posting we would get a 2-humped Gaussian distribution (approximately). But 
given the small sample size the distribution may actually be Gaussian. 

What we need to do is superimpose a curve plotting # of major new features 
(eg, disc brakes, wasserboxer, dual port engines, etc) versus year to see 
if there is any correlation between major design changes and the 
mortality of these vehicles. 

I'm bored today (and leaving this job soon) so I'll work something up on 
GNUplot and post it as a postscript file. Statistics run amok. Somebody 
call the Reality Police.

Ack, we could analyze this beast to death, heh?
