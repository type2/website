Subject: NEATO page updated w/ Chassis &amp; Engine numbers


I updated the NEATO Technical Data Page to include some chassis 
and engine numbers.  These numbers came from some scraps of paper 
I keep in my wallet for &quot;junkyard identification&quot;, not a 
comprehensive production survey, so there are a few ommissions 
and possibly a few mistakes.

For example, I couldn't remember when the engine went from 25hp 
to 36hp, but I thought it was 1954.

Any clarifications (or Clara-fications :)  ) would be welcome.

Take a look at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html
