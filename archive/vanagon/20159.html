&gt; &gt;I  haven't had the problems you have had however I have noticed one thing
&gt; &gt;with my 87' Syncro.  There are a lot of hoses which i have found to be
&gt; &gt;chafing against brackets, and other things within the engine compartment.  At
&gt; &gt;Mike 87' Syncro
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Anyone had any of the metal piping bits go yet? Mine look pretty badly 
&gt; pocked, especially the big double unit over the engine nearest the trans. I 
&gt; am afraid to take it of and sandblast it, I think the rust is all that's 
&gt; holding it together.  tim s. ('87 syncro)

OH YES!!!  mine blew big_time&gt; dumped my coolant like right now and i 
had to get towed home,  cost about $90 for the pipe plus 
installation.  Not a hard job but it was winter.
