OK Volks -
        Here's the latest.  Dad and I pulled the fridge this week-end
(thanks for all the instrux awhile back) to investigate the hot smell.
Everything looked perfect so we re-installed, fired her up and left her on
overnight.  Worked great but still had a slight hot smell, plus we were
missing the cover plate for the vent on the side of the cabinet, so we
pulled it out again.  Didn't find the missing part and the fridge still
looked great (the smell is coming from the insulation around the pipe but we
opened it and looked and there is no evidence of singed anything so I guess
it just gets really hot).  We re-installed (a hassle) but it wouldn't fire
up.  Pulled AGAIN (#3), Dad checked the igniter for a spark, which is
working fine, re-installed last time and it STILL wouldn't fire up.  Yes, we
have gas turned on, etc, etc.  Any ideas (other than should have left well
enough alone)??  Right now we're feeling pretty sick!
