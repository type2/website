Subject: Re: Another replacement tire for EVers?

Is this the European made G64 tire?  Or a differetnt Goodyear tire?

We liked the Goodyears.  A lot.  But pricey.  I could run through 3 feet 
(1 meter for the measurement conversion impaired) with no real problems.

We're now running the Michelins in the &quot;differnt size&quot;.  WE've not had 
enough snow nor I enough use to compare.

But if this is a different tire...

&gt; Has anyone had any experience w/ them?  I imagine they must
