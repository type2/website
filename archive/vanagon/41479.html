Subject: C.W. McCall and minor '66 update



Rodney sez,

&gt; Anyone remember this song:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Me an' RJ an' the kids went on a campout in the Mountains, and we had
&gt; us one-o'-them U-drive-em army jeep cars which we had rented from a

Yep, &quot;Black Bear Road&quot; is on one of my favorite drivin' CDs called something
like &quot;C.W. McCall, Greatest Hits&quot; that I picked up about 3 years ago when I was
camped in Ouray, Colorado.  (The guy who sang the songs was mayor of Ouray
for a number of years.)  This contains the most recently redone versions
of some of C.W.'s most famous songs like &quot;Wolf Creek Pass&quot;,&quot;The Silverton&quot;,
&quot;Convoy&quot;, &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;, and &quot;Columbine&quot;.  Doesn't have another one of my
favorites, &quot;Classified Ad&quot;, but I've got that on another CD.

(you remember that one? went sumpthin like,  
&quot;I was thumbin' through the want ads in the Shelby county tribune, when
this classified advertisement caught my eye, it said 'take immediate delivery
on this '57 Chevrolet half ton pickup truck, will sell or swap for a hide-a-bed
and thirty-nine bucks, call 1-4-0 ring 2 and ask for Bob' ......  )

Sorry Gerry, no VW content yet.  Well, here's a little.

Update on the '66.

I didn't get much done on the '66 this last weekend, went camping in the
mountains with friends, etc. etc.

Friday night I *did* manage to clean my thermostat shutters and assemble
them into the fan shroud for a preassembly test.  Looks good. How much
pressure should it take to pull the shutters closed?  Should the spring
be almost slack when the shutters are open or should there be a little
tension holding them open?

Cheers,

 -Dyer
