Subject: propane tank label--dangerous defect

As we discussed a couple of months ago, the Manchester propane tank we have
has a metal label welded on to the side of it. This label does not sit flush
with the tank but seems to be tack welded on four corners. 

The result is that moisture and salt can easily get under the label and
corrosion begins. 

A couple of months ago one of my labels became so corroded that it came
loose and I took pains to bend it back and forth until it came off. Now my
2nd tank that I keep on the opposite side of the vehicle has had its label
come loose. Last weekend I worked the label off by bending it back and forth. 

I am writing to report that the amount of corrosion under there was truly
horrible. This label is a design defect. Eventualy, it will cause the rust
to eat away the wall of the tank and propane will come out when a rock hits
the tank or you hit a curb. 

Boom.

Even if I bought a brand new tank tomorrow, I would immediately sawzall the
label off and sand/paint the area. Trying to seal the edges of the label
against the tank with sealent will not help as I tried that and all the
silicone does is trap moisture under there. Trying to squirt rust
neutralizer under the label will not work as I tried this too to no benefit. 

The fact is, the label has to come off!

Every Camper owner on this list be advised that you have a bad situation
under there. I urge you to see if you can work that label off at the next
opportunity.
