Subject: Re: last minute checks

I'm also off to France in my '73 kombi at the end of Summer for a
few weeks.
A few cheap spares that I carry are:
Accelerator cable
Clutch cable
Fan Belt

I think in France, they like you to carry a lurvely Red warning triangle,
in case you break down, also spare bulbs seem to be required on the 
continent. - could be wrong though! :) 
Just keep an eye out for the police, as they love to dish out on the spot
fines which need paying or else (bummer)
And one last thing that gives me the jitters every time I go across, smile
nicely at those Customs type people, just so they don't completely strip
your vehicle for a laugh :(
Fingers are crossed.....

Cheers 

Carl

&gt;     Hi all,
&gt;     
&gt;         I will be unsubscibing from the list for two weeks from 
&gt; tommorrow as I am going on holiday. I will be taking the camper 
&gt; ('71) to the west coast of France. I have replaced the plugs, checked 
&gt; the points, set the timing, checked the valves and changed the oil 
&gt; (andjoined the AA!). Can anyone think of anymore last minute checks I 
&gt; should make before I set off on the trip ?  Also what spares do 
&gt; you recomend (space and cash are limited)? Since getting the camper 
&gt; last year I have only made a couple of long trips, so the van is 
&gt; relatively untested, so please keep your fingers crossed for me. I 
&gt; will let you know how I get on when I get back. Thanks in advance for 
&gt; any help.
&gt; 
&gt;                     Cheers
&gt;                     
&gt;                             Jon
