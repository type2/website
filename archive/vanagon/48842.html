 Jim thanks for your insight.My Bently is still packed away w/ all my books
in
 a storage unit in Ramona,Ca., so I had to go by the warning listed in the
 owners' manual.You may be correct on the fact that a tow is similar to a
 coast, but w/ a coast the engine is running(maybe) and the input shaft
throws
 lube to the gears(maybe insignificant).I realise that your standard issue
 &quot;dufus&quot; tow operator would lift the rear and destroy the viscous unit by
 spinning up the front with the rear immobilized, therefore the caveat, but
im
 not entirely convinced that VW didnt intend this solely for the
&quot;dufers&quot;.But,
 If youve towed w/o any trouble for some distances...it's probably OK.

Actualy, very little oil is thrown buy the input shaft.  In fact, extended
engine idling will destroy the input bearings.  Running the engine at speed
makes things worse.  Depressing the clutch transmits this wear to the release
bearing.  Flat towing will not damage the trans any more than normal driving.
 Bear in mind that the gear oil will heat up and some wear is transmitted to
the syncros as they will forever be sliding.  Again this is normal excet the
4th gear is usually engaged.

A more improtant consideration is what is doing the towing?  Also, most
states have laws that require trailers over either 1,000 or 2,000lbs (state
dependant) be equipped with brakes.  A towed vehicle is not treated
differently.  A Synchro wiehgs about 4,000lbs plus all the stuff that people
will put into it while towing.  If you are cut off by some nut, not only wil
you be in the &quot;wrong&quot; for rear ending someone, I can assure you will be sued
big time for pulling that un-braked trailer.  Although I've towed flat
Vanagons a number of times,  I recomend a dolly or trailer that has brakes.
 The ones at U-haul work well for the Vanagon.  If using a dolly, you will
have to remove the center driveshaft on a Syncro.  I do also recomend
removing the rear drive shafts from the axles,(12 bolts) to save wear on the
trans. Actully, if you disconect the rear drive shafts, you will not have to
remove the center shaft on the syncro and the front drive line can move the
van short distances to get the van on and off the dolly.
