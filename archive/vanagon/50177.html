&gt;Test drove my first synchro at a ford dealership Sunday.  It was a 1989

Stop right there!  I'll assume you're in the USA.  VW didn't sell any Carat
Syncros in the USA.  These were two distinctly different models.  It sounds
like someone's been playing a little bit of random badge &quot;engineering&quot;.

&gt;After shifing into 4th it began making a fairly loud whinning sound, much 
&gt;like all terrain tires make at high speed, only I'm pretty sure it was 
&gt;coming from the transmission. The pitch varied with the speed.  The 
&gt;salesman said all synchros do this. Was he speaking with forked tongue?

He speak with heap big fork tongue.  My Syncro hasn't ever exhibited the
whining symptom you mention.  Sounds like it could be the differential
perhaps.
