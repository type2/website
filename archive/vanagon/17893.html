Cetin,

Most dealers are aware of this method...but few consumers have the
&quot;testicular fortitude&quot; to pull it off! I've done it lots of time
to the extent that I have trained my local dealer that as soon as I
walk in the door I don't have to haggle...I even get to see his
&quot;books&quot; with his costs and go from there!  ;-)
