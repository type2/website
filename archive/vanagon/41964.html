Subject: 4WD Westy

     I have a freind that is having some problems with a 4WD Westy. I don't 
     have too much information but here is what I have.
     
     Once the vehicle warms up it has a bad habit of going into 4WD at 
     higher speeds.
     
     Any thoughts????
     
     Thanks in advance
