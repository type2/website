Subject:      Westy Purchase / Questions

Just wanted to report the I have purchased my first Westy
from listmember Malcolm Williamson.  Since I am located
in Jackson, WY (anyone want to visit?) and he is located in
Fayetteville, AR, we met in Tulsa, OK (I flew, he drove) where
I purchased the vehicle from him.  I want to thank the list
for putting me in contact with Malcolm and allowing me to feel
some modicum of trust in buying a vehicle over $1300 miles away.

So, driving from OK to WY allowed me to explore / experience my
new Westy.  Camped in Rocky Mtn National Park in CO on the way.
While in the park, I encountered two small problems.  First,
whenever I left the Westy stopped for more than ~5 min, and then
went to restart it, the Alternator and Oxygen Sensor lights would
stay on until I revved the engine.  This stopped happening as I
dropped in Altitude (I was around 11,000-12,000 ft) and the
temperature of the day increased.  The manual seemed to indicate
that this was normal for the Alternator light, but not for the O2
sensor.  Anyone think that this is an indication of a potential
problem?

The other problem that started around ~7000 ft after a long day of
driving, was that at idle the engine would rev up and down ~50 to ~100
rpms, causing the vehicle to &quot;surge&quot; forward when stopped.
This problem seems to get worse the longer I drive, but does
not go away entirely.  Any thoughts as to what might cause a problem
like this?  My first thought is the altitude change, as Jackson is
at about 6500 ft.  Solutions ?

Thanks,
Stephen Jones
