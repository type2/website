Subject: Camping withdrawl symptoms

Because I can't go on the Baja trip (because I have to work that weekend) 
I started to have camping withdrawl symptoms.

So I decided on the spur of the moment to go up into the Sierra's THIS 
WEEKEND, Saturday, Sunday and Monday to take pictures and relax.

If anyone is interested in joining me for any or all of the weekend, let 
me know.
