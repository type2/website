&gt; Second question, when I look at the heat guage on the dashboard, where 
&gt; is it getting the reading from?

from a sensor back at the engine.

 &gt; In other words, where is the sensor.  
&gt; I can drive the van and it registers heat.  I can stop the van and 15 
&gt; minutes later, (after not running), I can start it again, and it is 
&gt; registering COLD.  I realize it is cold here but I would imagine that 
&gt; it would be able to retain SOME heat.

these engines cool down REALLY fast.  i've noticed the same thing.  
partial responsibility is due to the little engine submerged in a 19 
liter cooling system.  a conventional 4 would have maybe 7 liters.  
and this 19L is spread out over the length of the van so it does cool 
fast.  yes, the thermostat shouldn't allow coolant to circulate until it 
is warm but the heating system alone holds alot detracting from the 
thermal storage.  likewise, they are slow to warm due to the quantity 
of coolant.  yeah, yeah, the thermostat is s'posed to hold up the 
circulation until things are warm but experience says other-wise.  
also, there are *2* heater cores pulling as many BTUs as they can from 
the engine.

one can speed up the warming time of the wasserboxer by keeping the 
rear heater fan off and closing the front water valve lever.  it 
noticably decreases the time it takes the temp guage to climb to 
normal.  of course, one doesn't get cabin heat either so maybe  this 
is just a facinating useless fact.  my personal unfounded biased 
opinion is that one *seems* to warm the van up faster if the engine 
gets to temp quicker *then* the heat is turned on.  totally 
subjective.  i do this occassionally but wouldn't dream of suggesting 
it to my wife...  leads to &quot;the look&quot; given an obsessive husband.  

can't blame her.
