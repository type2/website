&gt;I have been wanting for some time to put a German plate

&gt;the back).  Do you know any where I could get a used original one that
&gt;is the horizontal kind.  I do not want a personalized one, just an
&gt;original.  Helmut in Germany said he could get me one for $55 including
&gt;shipping.  Thanks a lot.  Have a great weekend.

Jan Peters (that lucky SOB) has an original German bumper on his '91
syncro, which has a licence plate indentation that matches the euro-style
plate.
