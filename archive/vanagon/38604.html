&gt; All of the text is in German, but there are some GREAT pictures.  Does anybody

I imagine the differences would be substantial.  I wonder if the Westy is
built into the longer wheelbase van like the Winnie Bagoo?

When I was looking for my EV, I called VW's 800 number and asked about
Weekender availability.  In the process, I also asked about the program
they used to have where one could go to Europe for a vacation, have a
California (or whatever) smog-equipped Westy waiting for you, buy the thing
to tour Europe, then ship it home.  The lady said that they were getting
lots of requests for that service again, and they might bring it back.
That'd be cool. Like, say, a Synchro westy in some COLOR besides WHITE!
