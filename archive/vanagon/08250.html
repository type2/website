Well, gang,
Here's a fairly important question ... How does one tow an injured vanagon
say 1000 miles?  What special things will need to be removed?
Why, you might ask, would I ever ask such a silly question?  Well she
who must be obeyed and I are going to take the vanagon from montana to
virginia in a few days and if it dies, I'll come back to montana and pull
it back with my pickup.  Looking through the various books, I don't really
see any information about what to do if you need to tow the thing for more
than 50 miles.  I know that Mark towed his over 1000 miles once, but his
transmission was already dead at that point.  Any suggestions?
PS: I am taking my computer with me.  If we get stuck, I'll post ...
