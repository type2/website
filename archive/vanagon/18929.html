&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;OK, so far there are only a few of you responded to my plea. I guess most
&gt; &gt; &gt;of you do not have the problem?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The number of responses is too few to support me the point that it is indeed
&gt; &gt; &gt;a VW engineering problem. So it will be hard to finger point to VW for
&gt; &gt; &gt;compensation for the repair. It will be up to the arbitrator to determine
&gt; &gt; &gt;my fate.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, I managed to get an estimate from a dealer today without having to
&gt; &gt; &gt;take the engine apart. It is $2071.34 including replacement of both heads.
&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't really like to pay this much to fix it. I'll probably exchange
&gt; &gt; &gt;the westy's engine with the 84 vanagon and keep the vanagon for occasional
&gt; &gt; &gt;use or sell it or use the rest of it as parts source for the westy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks much for those who responded to help. Very much appreciated.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; David:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't quite know what to make of the response here either. I was under
&gt; &gt; the impression - a few months back - that we had reached a critical mass of
&gt; &gt; Vanagon owners with this problem. Now it doesn't quite seem the case.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;  I dont know myself either !!!
&gt;  It may seem that either too many of us are just too resigned to hope that
&gt; something can be done or VW may have offerred secret settlements to those
&gt; who had complained. You can be sure I am not one of those.
&gt;  I am still mad as hell in the way they treated me. i.e Worldwide VW, the
&gt; regional center of VW in the East Coast.
&gt; 
&gt;  I also mentioned the fact that I have a lawyer friend who will prepare
&gt;  the class action case for certification for around two grand. All we
&gt;  need is minimum of three persons to get this suit going. If more individuals
&gt; join in the cost will be prorated and the cost will be worth our while.
&gt; 
&gt;  I have not got one response from you fellas or my posts must have 
&gt; been missed due to the memorial day holidays when the listserver went
&gt; on autopilot.
&gt;  So if there are still parties interested pls response or forever hold
&gt;  your breath.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I've said before, when you drive around Seattle and see just how many
&gt; &gt; Wasserboxer Vanagons are driven just like normal cars (no yearly VW Blue
&gt; &gt; only coolant changes, etc) by people who obviously don't have 2k drop for a
&gt; &gt; new set of heads it does make one wonder as to how prevalent this problem
&gt; &gt; is.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I know for a fact that VoA has actually repurchased
&gt; &gt; Vanagons (ok, well at least 1) from people as part of a settlement of this
&gt; &gt; acknowledged problem.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's really to bad that VoA doesn't come clean and tell us the whole story.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Given the wide discrepancy of owner experiences and VoA responses to this
&gt; &gt; problem, my gut feeling is that somehow there were flawed engines produced
&gt; &gt; concurrently with non-flawed engines, whether from a different plant, on a
&gt; &gt; different line, or possibly even when assembled by Helmutt instead of
&gt; &gt; Dieter. Furthermore, I think it took them 'till about '87 to realize they
&gt; &gt; had a problem, and 'till about '90 to actually do anything substantial
&gt; &gt; about it (haven't heard of any head leaks from these years - yet). But I
&gt; &gt; bet by now they can look at you engine's serial # and know if it was
&gt; &gt; defective or not.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think there are a lot of us (like me) who fear the fateful day when the
&gt; &gt; coolant starts to disappear in large quatities, or expand radically from
&gt; &gt; exhaust blow-by, or drip all over the driveway. Whether it will happen or
&gt; &gt; not, I don't know, but we definitely need to stick together on this and
&gt; &gt; keep track of our various experiences.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; By the by, as you consider what to do with your engine, keep in mind that
&gt; &gt; at last notice, a factory rebuild Wasserboxer engine was going for $2380,
&gt; &gt; which (according to a posting of about a year ago) works out to around $3k
&gt; &gt; dealer installed.

    Only a squeaky wheel will ever get any grease !
&gt;   So to those of you who feel that VW must be responsible for their
     engineering defects, keep this post alive so that those who missed it
     will know it its not a dead issue.
