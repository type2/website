Subject: Re: westy H2O-tank key?



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have an '81 westy with no key to the water tank.  Does anyone
&gt;know if these keys are all the same or where I can get one?  I've
&gt;tried 3 dealers with no success.  If they ARE the same, is
&gt;anyone willing to make me a copy?

I had new keys for my tank cut about 2 months ago, (lost originals).
I removed the four screws that hold the &quot;delta six industries&quot;
flap/access hole assembly and eased out the whole H2O filler
works. Be carefull, the edges of the hole in the panel are
sharp.  The filler assembly should be hanging by the big
hose and smaller breather hose, remove both. Now you
can look at the rear end of the filler cap/lock and see
that it is held in the flap assembly by a brass nut,
which is held in place by two locking tabs. Bend the tabs
back, undo the nut, and everything should come apart.
I took the lock barrel to a locksmith and had two keys
cut for ~$5-7.  The locksmith recognised the lock
immediately, suspicious eh?

Be sure to put the hoses back on securely, the thought
flashes through my head whenever I fill up with water...
&quot;gee, it seems to taking forever, hope I'm not filling
up the inside of the van, ha-ha.&quot;
