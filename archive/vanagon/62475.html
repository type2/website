Subject: 85 westy no starteeee

Hello group: Last night had my 85 Westy decide not to start.... drove it 
late in afternoon and filled up with gas....parked it for several hours 
and when I went to start to go home... engine would turn over but no 
fire.... checked had spark _at_ plugs.... fuel seemed to be there.... looked 
for blown fuse ect... messed with all the plugs,wires,connections....
Then it started....0ooops!  Problem is now I know nothing was fixed so I 
will see the problem again..... Has anyone else had this problem? What 
should I look at???? This morning she ran great......we'll see what 
happens this afternoon.....   Thanks, Doc
