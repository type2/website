A 215 or 225-60/16 should do the job just fine.  The 225 is slightly larger
than the 205-70/14 and has a higher load capacity.  You may have trouble
finding this size in a snow tire but a lot of good high performance tires are
available.  These sizes are now standard equipment on may vehicles including
Caravans,(YUK).
