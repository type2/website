&gt;Berry, berry interesting. Someone who actually had their oil analyzed...I like
&gt;it! BTW, who did it for you, and (if you don't mind my prying) what did they
&gt;charge you? What kind of feedback (data) did they provide?
&gt;I could see this as being useful for all kinds of nerdy little automotive
&gt;experiments...

here's the folks that i know of who do this sort of thing:

Oil Analysis

Analysts, Inc.                mail-in kit costs about $25 for small
3075 Corners North Court      orders
Norcross, GA 30071            &lt;**these are the folks i used**&gt;
(404) 448-5235
(800) 241-6315
(404) 448-5918 Fax

Cleveland Tech                mail-in kit costs about $12.
(800) 726-5400

Aviation Lubrication          ask for George Morrison
Groveport, OH
(800) 666-6457

for $23.50, you get a little 'urine sample' kit. fill up the sample bottle
with your oil (as it drains from the engine), fill out the form and mail it
off in the little mailer box (postage NOT included).

about two weeks later, you get back a printed sheet report, showing the
results of the analysis (as well as any previous analyses done on the same
car ... you get to choose the car's coded id). they test for various metals,
combustion byproducts, etc. for diesel, there is a separate set of tests
available; and some other more extensive tests are also available. i have
mine checked about once a year (every 10,000 miles).
