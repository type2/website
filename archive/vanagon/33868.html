Subject: re 1995 EV Camper Insurance, Auto or RV

&gt;
&gt;Apparently Allstate has different policies for autos vs. RVs.
&gt;Although not apples to apples a rate he quoted me for a (non-Eurovan)
&gt;RV was significantly less. The way he put it is that RV
&gt;insurance is lower because they don't expect you to use your
&gt;RV nearly as often.
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested in knowing if other EV Camper owners are
&gt;insuring their vehicles as RVs or autos?
&gt;

I'm covered through State Farm. They also indicated at first that the rate
might be cheaper because of it's RV-like nature. (Then again it doesn't
have any more than the Vanagon camper did!) Anyway, the net result is that
it's covered as an auto - although the rate really isn't any higher than
any other car I have (and the newest is an '84). They did take into account
expected mileage, and wanted to say I wasn't using as a daily driver (which
i'm not.)
