&gt;The pipe on my '59 appears to be wrapped in asbestos. I refuse to touch it!

I'm with ya there.  I took mine off, but wore a respirator (not one of those
cheapie rubber band and paper things!

I looked like it was either fiberglass insulation or asbestos, and I 
didn't bother to do any analysis.

I plan to get foam pipe insulation to replace it, once I'm done detailing
the underbelly.
