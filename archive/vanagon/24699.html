Subject: 85 van cooling lines

A cooling line on my 85 vanagon rusted through and needs to be replaced.  
this is the large metal line which runs under the van from the radiator 
to the motor cooling lines.

I bought two at a local junk yard for next to nothing, however, one is 
squeezed for about 6 inches to less than half capacity.

Any suggestions on repairing the squeezed part?  Cut it out and fix it 
and weld it back in?  Weld in a tube of similar 
dimensions/characteristics?  Put in a hose?

Does anyone have any idea what they cost from the factory?
