Subject: Factory Liscence Plate Lock

I purchased the factory lock for the rear liscence plate thinking that this
would protect me from bag guys pouring sugar down my oil filler tube when I
was parked in manhattan. 

This part is shown in the microfiche but it is available only from Europe. I
send a photocopy of the relavant microfiche page to a dealer in Europe and
told him to ship me the parts by surface, government ordinary mail. 

He did as I asked. Before shipping he called me at 6am from Germany to
request that I send him a personal check for US$50, which I did.
