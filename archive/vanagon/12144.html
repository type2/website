&gt;During spirited cornering, I can smell gas comig through my

do you still have the fuel injection on the bus? if so, you might have a
&quot;weeping&quot; little injector hose or two ... check by feeling the fuel hoses
in the engine area. especially the ones at the injectors.
also check the ones that come into and out of the engine compartment. if
you've never replaced the fuel hoses, it might be a really good time to just
replace ALL of them, from the tank to the engine and back. be SURE to use
fuel injection (reinforced) hose.
