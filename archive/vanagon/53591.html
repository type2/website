Subject: Re: Fix for Mass Airflow Meter '91GL

You can give this part another half life by very very carefully bending the
wiper untile it makes contact with a new track on the carbon. Very very
carefully!

&gt;After thinking a lot and working a little on my daughter's '91GL that won't
&gt;start, I have discovered that there may well be a problem with the mass
&gt;airflow meter rheostat.
&gt;
&gt;I checked the terminal resistance on contacts 2-3 per Bentley and found
&gt;erratic readings. I then took the black plastic cover off and discovered
&gt;that the resistance board wiper strip is pretty well shot. The carbon is
&gt;worn away down to the base board material.
&gt;
&gt;The local dealer wants $469 for a new assembly including the large die cast
&gt;horn and the flapper. Outrageous to replace a bad resistance board that
&gt;probably doesn't cost Bosch more than a couple of dollars to make.
&gt;
&gt;I called VWOA and have not heard back from them. I can't get to the
&gt;archives tonight.
&gt;
&gt;My plan is to lengthen the wiper blade by about 1/16&quot; to get to new carbon
&gt;on the arc. It will be tricky. Anyone know if there is chance it will work?
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a better way to fix it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
