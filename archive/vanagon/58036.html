&gt; &gt; And best wishes to you too Charles. Most of the stuff on the list is
&gt; &gt;  related directly to the US, including vans for sale, equipment, etc.
&gt; &gt;  That's why I'm unsubscribing - it's a great list but not too relevant to
&gt; &gt;  me. The best part for me is reading about the excellent trips you all make
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt;  the US but hey, France, Italy, Norway, Russia etc are on my doorstep so
&gt; &gt;  I'm not too jealous!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I suppose we Brits shouldn't even have the right to subscribe to your
&gt; &gt;  US-centric mailing list?  Whatever happened to free speech?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I for one wish the list wasn't quite so US-centric.  Although I know
&gt; primarily about US spec Vanagons, I LOVE to hear about Vanagons
&gt; (Transporters, Caravelles, Kombis) in other parts of the world.  Please
&gt; consider staying on the list, encouraging others outside the US to join, and
&gt; tell us about your vehicles and your travels with them.

Here, here!!!

I don't want to get lumped in with the exclusionist faction either.

BTW, are there any VWs in Russia?
