Subject: Advice Needed: Poptop Seal - 82D Westflailia

I am going to do it!  The old, crusty, rotted seal is going to be 
replaced.  But with what - and from whom?

I've seen many sugestions for poptop seals.  What do you prefer?  I once 
read of a seal made with aluminum (rustproof) clips.  Does nayone have 
any info?  Are the aftermarkets as good as the OEM?  What are my 
choices?

Your thoughts are invited.
