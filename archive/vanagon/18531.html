Subject: Re: What gives???


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As I posted to the list in a message titled &quot;Administrative changes&quot;, I've
&gt;&gt;changed the list so the default for replies will be to the original
&gt;&gt;poster.  To send to the list, you'll need to reply to all. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Quiz tomorrow.

Gerry:

On my mailtool mails from the list always show originator's id. But in the
mail the &quot;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot; is the sender/originator.

It would work better for my PersonalPostMaster if these are reversed.
I can live with it though.
