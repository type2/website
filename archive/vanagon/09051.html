So Steve Wall says:
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what the attachment to the rear outlet was - I believe he
&gt; made a special adapter from plastic or something - I'll check next time
&gt; I see him.

&gt; 

Please do post that info. Steve!  I'm curious though.  Did he also hook
up to a front piece that distributes the air, or is it just the ends of
the hoses?
