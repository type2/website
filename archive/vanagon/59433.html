Joel...Change the stats!
Hi, my name is Jeff Bourdeau, I live in Burlington Vermont.  I 
recently puchased a beautiful 89 Westfalia (fridge, stove etc...) from Southern CA.  I also 
own a 73 campmobile.  I have been on the list for 3 
years...originally on the vanagon list then on the type II list after 
the &quot;split&quot;   I'm back!  I have been lurking for a two weeks on the 
Vanagon list and recognize some names I havent seen in a while.  Anyways, I have a few 
questions and would appreciate if somebody could answer them or point me in 
the right direction.

Top Seal- there were recent postings on the Type II list regarding a 
cheap source for purchasing the seals for the pop-up.  I believe that 
a list member purchase a bunch of it.   Who is it, and do they have any material left? 
 
I would like to purchase the Bentley Manual.  Any good sources to 
purchase the manual at a lower cost?

I would like to replace the coolant as a precationary measure 
(coolant may be slightly acidic).  Since I do not have the Bentley 
yet, can someone tell me how to replace the coolant?   I remember 
from the days before the split that I need to raise the front end to 
avoid cavitation.  Is there anything else I should know?  Where do I 
fill the coolent into the system?

I appreciate any help or info you can give me.
