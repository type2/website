Subject: Re: 84 GL rear passenger auxiliary heate



&gt;BTW I am really pleased with this heater. The front heater does not seem to
&gt;duct towards the back as it did in the aircooled (vents on the floor
&gt;between the 2 front seats). Is this for all watercooleds or only the ones
&gt;with a rear heater?

In the crewcabs there is a ductwork on top of the floor between the foot
heater in the front and the outlet on top of that place where are the floor
vents of the aircooled.

I have one set of an '87 crewcab for sale, the ductwork and an adapter box 
to
connect it to the front heater.
