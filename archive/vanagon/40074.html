Subject: Re: Alternative Instrumentation

&gt;      As usual you guys are out in the stars while I'm still
&gt;    trying to get the mud out of my hair. I was thinkng of maybe
&gt;    a central board that would be more accurate than cheap analog
&gt;    gages and send to digital read outs. Still do I need $1000
&gt;    worth of instrumentation to tell me this pig is sick?

Hey Mike,

$1000? I don't think it would be that expensive. I can buy a STAMP computer
from Parallax right now for $39, and it has 8 DAC I/O ports. To boot, it's
programmable in Basic and it's about the size of a business card.

I think where it get's mo' expensive is the sensing/sending units. I don't
know what those run. Still it's kind of a cool idea, no?

Cheers,

Bren
