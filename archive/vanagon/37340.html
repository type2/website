Subject:       Re: Flame: proposed posting title formats

&gt; Other standard messages could include:
&gt; 'problem diagnosis, help: &lt;whatever your problem is&gt;'
&gt; 'discussion:  &lt;blah, blah, blah&gt;'
&gt; etc., etc., etc.
&gt; 
&gt; if this is a waste of time, just flame me.....

How to get the listmembers to adopt this plan (this thread seems to 
rear its ugly head every 4-6 months) is the question.

Based on past performance, I doubt it will happen.  Understand I'm 
not berating the idea.  I find it helpful to see the year of the 
vehicle in the subject header when I'm reading along, so I always 
post my year when approptiate.

To each is own.   Unless we can get Stalin to moderate the list!  &lt;g&gt;
