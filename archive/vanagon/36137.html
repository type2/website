Hi Steve,

        thank you for your speedy reply.  The book is now in the mail
to you, along with photocopies of the invoice and sales draft and hard
copies of our email correspondence to date.  The return shipping postage
(US Mail) was $3.00, as is indicated on the envelope.

        I would also like to thank you for making the return so easy
and applaud you for removing the item from your catalog (which, by the
way, I have only seen electronically!).  I now see why my friend recommended
your company so highly.  Last night I thought &quot;I'll never buy anything
from Jade Moutain again!&quot;  After reading your email this morning, I will
not hesitate to do business with you again and will recommend your company
to others.  (Although I will *not* recommend item # BK912.)  You have saved
a customer!

Thank you,
-Greg Merritt
