Subject: Vanagon tranny swap?

Have a customer with an 84 Vanagon. Bad 1st/2nd gear...Wants to know what
his options are with regards to replacement trannies. He says he'd like a
5-speed (who wouldn't!) or something with a sliightly lower first. I told
him I'd ask the &quot;list&quot; for wisdom/advice as we don't &quot;do&quot; vanagons... only
the older splittie stuff.  Heck, I wouldn't know -where- to put the water!

thanks in advance

Kevin
