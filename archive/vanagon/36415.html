If I understand correctly, VW sold the VR6 engine to Mercedes and will 
be using the Audi 6 cylinder starting in 1997.

Just my $0.02

&gt; &gt;I hear that the V6 has one cylinder head, is that possible?
&gt; 
&gt; The VR6 is a &quot;narrow V&quot; engine.....traditional V6s have approx 60 degrees
&gt; between cylinder banks and two cylinder heads...the VR6 has 15 degrees 
&gt; between cylinder banks (the pistons are almost vertical). Because of the
&gt; design the banks of cylinders are close enough to make use of a single 
&gt; cylinder head.
