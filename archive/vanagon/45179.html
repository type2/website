Subject: Re &quot;useless subject headings&quot;


I (as the perptrator/complainer on ambiguous subject headings) agree to get
off this subject- just wanted to get some attention in hopes people NOTICE
the subject when they reply or write to 600 members.

   Now to get back to list subject and off this one, anyone going to the
Punchbuggy Show at Atco Raceway, NJ July 14??     mb
