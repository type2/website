&gt; Anyway, it's a drop-in replacement. Just remove the sealed beams and 
&gt; replace with Hella units that you obtain from a good FLAPS that handles 
&gt; Volks stuff. You are looking for non-sealed beam lamps with replaceable 
&gt; bulbs. They may disclaim that these are for off-road use only, but pay no 
&gt; mind.

I've been considering this upgrade for some time. JC Whitney lists
a total of 7 different 7&quot; H4 units. I assume all these would fit
my Vanagon. Does anybody have an opinion on which ones I should
buy? Is the Hella unit worth more than twice the $$ of the cheapos?

These are the JCW catalog listings (p.42 ans 43 in my January catalog):

&quot;200% Brighter...&quot;
13BD9317U	7&quot;round		$16.95 		(?? Watts)

&quot;Hi power off road lights&quot;
88BD9533W	7&quot;round		$19.95		(90/130W bulb)
88BD9556X	7&quot;round		$18.95		(80/100W bulb)

&quot;Lead crystal lens&quot; These look ugly on the picture. All the others
look identical.
13BD9301Y	7&quot;round		$24.95		(90/130W bulb)
13BD9302W	7&quot;round		$22.95		(80/100W bulb)
13BD9303U	7&quot;round		$21.95		(55/60W bulb)

&quot;Hella vision plus...Now SAE and DOT approved for street and highway use&quot;
&quot;50 % more power on low beam, 25% more power on high beam&quot;
15BD7017P	7&quot;round		$39.99		(?? Watts)

Has anybody tried any of these?

(Disclaimer: This is no endorsement of JCW. I just happen to have
that catalog)
