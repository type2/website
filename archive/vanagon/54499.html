&gt;I have an 83 Westy, and I need to replace the rear brake linings.  The

&gt;access to the linings.  It shows the removal of the large nut that secures 
&gt;the hub to the spindle.  Does anyone know what the size of that metric nut 
&gt;is?  Does anyone know where I might find a socket large enough to remove 
&gt;it.

Byron,

Discount Import Parts, 8622B SW Hall Blvd., Beaverton, OR, Phone (503)
626-7036, has a 46mm axle nut tool for $9.95.  I used this on my '84 Vanagon
GL.  It is not a socket but accepts a 1/2 inch drive socket ratchet. 

Also, are you aware of Halsey Import Parts Distibuting, 7721 NE Halsey,
Portland, phone (503) 256-0182, (800) 792-0081. They have the best
priced/quality VW parts I have found.
