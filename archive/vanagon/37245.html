Bob,

As a member of the quiet majority, I would like to add my heartfelt 
gratitude to those who have written in your support previously.  It would 
be a dark day indeed when I knew that I didn't have your posts to look 
forward to.  

Send the naysayers my way, I'll be glad to take care of them in my own 
inimitable style (oops, there goes my New York City born and raised self 
raising its ugly head again ;) ).

Besides, we lost George yesterday, and the world is lesser for his 
passing.  I'm not ready to lose another just yet, even if only to silence.

Jack
