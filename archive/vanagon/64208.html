Katy:

Use &quot;Chem-Dry Stain Extinguisher&quot; carbonated cleaner.  Available at
Chem-Dry Carpet Cleaners, Price-Club/Costco etc..  Works GREAT!

&gt; We've just acquired an '84 Westfalia with two problems (well, a lot more
&gt; than 2 problems but only two for this posting).  Dennis, the Westy, has
&gt; mold on his ceiling.  I am afraid to scrub it because I think I might
&gt; take off the sprayed-on fuzzy stuff.  Does anyone have a solution?  Will
&gt; bleach discolor the fuzzy stuff?
&gt;
&gt; My other question is about the curtains.  I really would like to give
&gt; them a good cleaning but am concerned about unscrewing the fabric from
&gt; the wall.  Will it ruin the fabric? Does anyone have any other
&gt; suggestions?
