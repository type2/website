Subject: New to list.  Just bought 88 Vanagon
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Hello,

Just bought an 88 Wolfsburg Vanagon with a blown headgasket. I scored it
for $1200.  I hope I didn't pay to much. The former owner decided he
could fix it himself and broke off 3 head studs. Does any one have any
secrets for removing these broken studs? One of the studs is flush with
the case, the other two are almost all there. What are the best sources
fo parts (mailorder,shop, etc). Thanks for the info.
