&gt; There was a post back in November about generators making noise at
&gt; campsites. Then somebody mentioned a tuba. We like tubas. But we
&gt; really hate campers who use generators, and all other noise pollution
&gt; including loud stereos.

Me too.  I generally don't camp at places that people with generators
go to, just to avoid the problem.  Most of the places the people with
generators go to aren't more than parking lots anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; We just want to know if there are any other wind players out there.
&gt; Bob plays trombone in a brass quintet, and french horn in the local
&gt; community band.  Penny plays clarinet in the band, too. Four of our
&gt; children also play, and we have a family band (wind ensemble).

The only wind instrument I can play is my armpit.  :)  
 
&gt; Have any other wind players had the courage or gall to strike up the
&gt; band at a campsite?

I think we tried it a little at Red Rock, but we needed more
participants.  Martha is certainly musically inclined (along with her
daughter Sarah) and I keep a melodica in the camper, although I have to
be pretty drunk before I will play it in front of anyone.  Fortunately,
that's not usually a problem.  I assume the Gulbransen family will be
accompanying us to baja this fall?  A couple of guitars and we could
really have something...
