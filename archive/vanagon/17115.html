Subject: Re: 'falia sink pump q

Shoot! That was it? I thought mine was shot when I got my Westy last
year... so I went ahead and bought a submersible, bore a hole in the 
plastic cover to route the wires, hooked up the wires to the on-off
switch, and now when I turn the water on, a steady stream of water
comes out (was the original switch able to vary the flow of water
anyway?). It was a lot of pain to get this done. Now I don't even
want to rewire the old pump to see whether it work. Major bummer!

So I'll &quot;sour grape&quot; on the thing and say that the old pump must have been
shot anyway.   :-(

(Too late for me to have found this conference...)
