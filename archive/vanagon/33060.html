Subject: Re: Idiot factor

Add one to the Compleat Idiot column:

Like the time I started the bus to move it from the storage
shed to the barn to fix the brakes...pulled right fine into
the barn...and didn't stop when I pushed the brake pedal to
the floor.  Duh, now WHY was I moving this thing in the
first place?  Oh, yeh, finally got the one-year-only '67
master cylinder to put in.

Fortunately, nothing was hurt but my pride, what was left of
it after the adrenaline rush!
