Subject: Synchro article fixed on web page
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 1995 09:17:21 -0800 (PST)

It has come to my attention that the Synchro road test article was not
accessable from my vw page.  It has now been fixed (permissions on the
file were wrong, no clue how it happened!).  I noticed that at least
a dozen people have tried to access it in the last month, and I assume
none of them were able to read it.  Also, I added a clickable e-mail
address for comments, flames, or flannel jokes.  Thanks to Ron Lussier
for the suggestions!
