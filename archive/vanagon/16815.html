Subject: Ragtop.....

Just picked up my '65 &amp; 1/2 ucro deluxe from the auto trim place.  I'd
have to give them a B on the headliner job :\(   A new rag top was also
installed.  The metal runners that slide just outside of the track have
threaded holes at the terminal ends.  How does this attach to the rag top?
Should I attach the runner ends to the rag top (to minimize wind and rain from
entering into my new (grade B installation job) headliner.  If so what is the 
proper procedure? Anyone?  Your insights pleez......
