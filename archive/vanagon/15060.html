Howdy,.

	Next week, I'm taking some time off from work (hopefully) and I was
planning on doing some welding in the engine compartment.  Hence both the
tank and engine are coming out (not necessarily in that order...)
	
	remember, this is a '56 kombi

	I have some questions:

	The new tank is out of a '67, I see no reason this should not work,
but has anyone here done this before?  

	Anyone retrofitted the fuel gauage before?  I have no idea how the
thing hooks up...

	What is the capacity of the '67 tank?  I was told the capacity on
the '56 tank was 11.1 gallons; a friend told me he thinks the capacity on the
'67 was 15 Gallons or so.  Anyone have a reliable source of info for this?
(ie owners manual)

	I also wanna hook up my reserve valve - anyone ever put one on an
later tank?

	What should I use to seal the threads when I put said valve in?

	What was the consensus on the bulkhead fitting?  I thought that was
a GREAT idea!

	Anyone ever put one of the separators from a later bus between the 
engine and gas tank?  I like that idea, too.  Prolly cuts down on the noise
a bit...

	If all goes well, I'm going to paint the entire engine compartment
with the same paint I'm using for the bus!
	
	Thanks for your support.

&gt; My kid can beat up your honor student.
