Dave Phillips says:
&gt;I regularly see 250 or more when it's 115F and I'm climbing the mountain 
&gt;(the usual operating condition around these parts).  I run 20W50 and watch 
&gt;the oil pressure gauge.  The engine doesn't seem adversely affected.

When our '75 Westy climbed Arizona mountains (Cottonwood in the Flagstaff
area), the gauge actually went up to 285 (!) F, the highest ever. The
gauge reads high, though; the guesstimate of what it should have read is
about 25 F less.

Here's a question to Those-Who-Know: can I recalibrate the gauge, for
example by putting a variable resistor between the dipstick sender and the
gauge?
