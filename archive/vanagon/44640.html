Subject: 86 Westy Syncro oil pressure woes

After trying everything from using the OEM filter to replacing the sending
units I bit the bullet and installed a VDO oil press. gauge. Low and behold I
have an actual oil press. problem. After  the van reaches operating temp. the
gauge reads about 6-9 psi at idle and about 22 psi at highway speeds. This is
after a so called reliable dealer assured me that the pressure checked out at
32psi.. What I'd like to find is what my options are. The van dosen't burn
any oil or smoke a bit, and it still gets about 18 mpg on the highway. We've
taken it on some 1000 mile weekends and it runs like a dream, should I be
concerned or just let it be? It has about 125,000 miles on it.

          Thanks again in advance, 
                  Kris
