  OFFICE MEMO          EV Tires                               Date:6/18/96

Hello all,
The Conti's on the EV MV are just about toast. Flatspots and a host of other
problems. I am having a VERY hard time finding replacements of any kind. I am
finding non reinforced all over the place but cannot find reinforced. 

How big a deal is a reinforced tire? I do not haul anything heavier than
people and bicycles. No boats, trailers, or anything like that.

That ever lovin' input would be greatly appreciated.....

Kevin
