&gt; I'm not up to date on the prices of Vanagons in the UK, only earlier buses.  
&gt; For a good pre-80 Westfalia (ie no rust) you would pay at least 2000 and as  
&gt; high as 4000 (we're talking pounds here) but you lose nothing in  
&gt; depreciation. Other campers such as Devons and Danburys can be cheaper but  
&gt; are usually not as well equipped. 

   True. A friend bought his 74 Devon conversion a reasonable condition
   with a well reconditioned engine (its the only camper I know of that 
   can do 30mpg) for 850 pounds. The interior stuff is err, lets say 
   basic, but would suffice for a couple of months and it has a nice
   pop top. 2000 pounds for a non Westy should get you a very good
   pre-80 model (well at least round here..)
