Hi Folks!

My '85 is idling poorly. It will idle fine for a second or two and then
it will stumble like it is going to die. Just before it dies, it will
pick up to a normal idle and then repeat the process again. Thinking 
it might be the basics I changed the spark plugs, cap and rotor. They 
needed changing but it did not fix the problem. I then changed to temp
sensor; still no fix. Hmmm... maybe the air flow meter resistor needs 
cleaning. Still no fix. I'm now suspecting the idle stabilizer. I
bypassed it per Bently and it runs worse without it. I'm not sure what
that means. Depending on the price I guess I might just replace it. Any
thoughts? What the heck does that thing do anyway besides the obvious.
What's inside it?

My only other experince with FI is:

Genreally runs crappy... Change plugs, cap and rotor.

Blows out lots of black smoke, no power... clean air flow meter
resistor.

Fails DEQ test... change O2 sensor.


Thanks for any help,

Steve H
