Subject: Re: How to Steal VW Vans Quickly

&gt;Ha....thought this might get your attention.
&gt;
&gt;My van has been burglarized four times over the years, almost always by 
&gt;someone prying/breaking open the right hand vent window in front. What is 
&gt;the experience of others on the list, I wonder?
&gt;
&gt;Any defensive ideas ?  Favorite alarms?

 My beetle was broken into a few years back. The thief stole a sleping bag
from the back. It was a cold night and I figured who ever stole it needed
it.

Later my '74 camper was broken into to steal my $30 radio. They broke the
little window which cost more than the stinkin' radio. I replaced both and
stopped locking the camper. Now on my second camper, I still don't lock it.
I park downtown and leave very little to steal in it.
I also live in a little city where thieves aim more for red, expensive
sports cars and not that old &quot;hipppie van&quot; over there. My fly-rod and vest
are the most expensive things and they're up under the top. I've not been
broken in since, but I'm sure it will happen, this time with as little
damage as possible.

I broke into  a van once that someone had parked on a hill by pounding on
the side window until it moved the latch over enough to get to the lock
mechanism. The van was slowly, inch by inch rolling down the hill and into
traffic. I got the hand brake off and eased it back to the side of the road
before the steering locked. I put the hand brake on tighter and left a
note. A small crowd watched me. It was strange.
