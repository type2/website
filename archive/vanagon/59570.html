Dear Gerald Skerbitz and VW Listees,

I currently use best as an isp.  They have bestserve.  As far as I can 
tell there is no charge for the service.  I work with another guy in a 
whitewater club to administer the site.  The site is very reliable.  One 
of their claims to fame is that unlike majordomo, there is noway to 
download the list...no spams to the list.  They have 2 T3's in place, so 
plenty of bandwidth.

If any wants more info here is the url for listserve.
http://support.best_dot_com/bestserv/

If there is interest from a person to be a co-moderator, I will 
investigate it.

&gt;Hi Gang,
&gt;I've been running the Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu mailing list for over 3 years
&gt;now.  It's been great, but frankly, I'm very tired of it and would like to
&gt;stop.
&gt;I'm looking for someone to take over the list.  All of it. Ron Lussier was 
&gt;interested in hosting it at his site, but backed out for reasons of network
&gt;resources and $$.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By the end of this month, I will be turning it off.  Anyone interested in
&gt;taking on this job in any way is welcome to it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;P.S. Thanks for all the beer!
&gt;--
