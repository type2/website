Subject: Getting bolts off calipers


I have an '84 Camper, and I'm trying to get the calipers off the front to
have the front calipers re-built, the right front is sticking, and keeps
fairly steady pressure on the pads so the wheel is somewhat resistant to
turning by hand. I cannot get the caliper bolts off for the life of me! Any
suggestions? I tried &quot;loosening them up&quot; with WD-40, but I even bent a half
inch wrench using a hydraulic floor jack to try to rotate them upwards
(counter-clockwise of course)!

Thanks!........Rich Fischer
