&gt; One thought, do we want to coordinate this dinner with the folks on the
&gt; GNATT? They will be coming through Seattle on May 31 going to Victoria on
&gt; June 1.

Paul,
	A great idea!  The route has changed, and is presently going to 
hit the Victoria/Seattle region the weekend of June 09-11.  I just
remembered that I need to update that portion of the Web page - aiiigh!
Could we have pizza Saturday night, June 10th?  Please keep me posted...
