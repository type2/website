&gt;I just had a shop check out my engine and they said that there is evidence
on

is
&gt;to just wait until it blows as long as I stay in the USA.  When I mentioned
&gt;my anual trip to a remote spot on Baja Coast they said definitly have the
heads
&gt;done before going.  The engine is a 2.1 on my '86 Syncro Westy.  Any input
is
&gt;appreciated as they quoted me from $800 to $2000 for the job.

My experience is that these leaks are pretty gradual and that if it started
getting noticeable on a long trip you could easily just keep adding coolant
(and maybe some stop-leak) and keep it going for quite a while.  Maybe if the
Baja trip is for an extended period of time (months?), I'd consider having it
done ahead of time, otherwise, just start saving your money now, for the
future inevitible expense.
