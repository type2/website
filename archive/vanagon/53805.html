Subject: 86 interior sliding door panel 
Date: Mon, 06 Jan 97 17:11:16 EST  

Hey All,
I'm a member of the T2 air cooled list, but figured I could &quot;cross-cool&quot;  
for a friend.  
My Friend has a 86 Camper and told me he needed a new sliding door  
interior panel.
I gave him the # of RMMW and WCM.
Any other leads?
I think the panel is brown vinyl.
(I suggested a wood panel for the rustic look but he wants stock)
E-mail me or I will check your archives
Thanks!
