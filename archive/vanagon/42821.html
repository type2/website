&gt;&gt; Then the guy who puts the JATO unit on the Nova (at least they didn't ask
&gt;&gt; for money)
&gt;
&gt;You must admit, that was a rather good story!

Yea, but does Kennedy Engineering make an adapter for the bus?  And what is
the effect on your reduction boxes?

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The basic rule is, if its not germane to the list, don't post it.
&gt;&gt; Especially if it says to post it everywhere.  Treat with skepticism every
&gt;&gt; weird email that comes your way.
&gt;
&gt;Amen.  I come to the Vanagon list to GET AWAY FROM COMPUTERS!  You 
&gt;can only handle eating sleeping breating fixing troubleshooting 
&gt;networking rebuilding computers for so long and then you need a VW 
&gt;break.

The secret of success is to eat drink sleep breath fix troubleshoot upgrade
rebuild restore *Volkswagens*, then when you need a break, go hack a
computer. (Did you know Kennedy Engineering makes an adapter that lets you
put either a PowerPC or a Pentium Pro in your S-100 system?) ;-)
