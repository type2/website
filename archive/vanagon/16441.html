&gt; &gt; Exactly - what is meant by &quot;octane&quot;.  Come on you organic chemists -
&gt; &gt; fill me (us) in.

&gt; Well, like Methane, Ethane, Propane... Octane is a hydrocarbon.
&gt; Meth, Eth, and Pro all denote the number of Hydros attached to the
&gt; carbons (I think Pro is four) Oct is eight...  Just like an Octopus
&gt; has eight cats... or does it eat cats?

Well, it's been years since Organic chem, but....
I think Methane has one Carbon, Ethane two, Propane three etc...
Octane does have eight.  however, the &quot;Octane&quot; in gas is actually some 
branched structured thing not:
			  H H H H H H H H
			H-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-H
			  H H H H H H H H 

It has at least one...maybe two C's coming off at different places.  I 
seem t o remember isooctane.


&gt; Anyway, the octane is more resistant to burning than the gasoline,
&gt; (gasoline is another ___ane, I don't know which, I passed that class
&gt; and forgot everything)  therefore, the higher the octane, the slower
&gt; the fuel will burn off.  This allows the timing to be advanced further
&gt; which in turn allows the flame to be spread throughout more of the 
&gt; combustion chamber at TDC, providing better performance.

I don't know about any of this.  &quot;Damn it Jim!  I'm a biologist, not a 
physical chemist!&quot;
