Subject: '87 Syncro Camper 5 spd?

To those who've gone before. Is it feasible to add the 
S.African 5 spd tranny and what the heck, the 2.6i motor as well. I 
found the retail price of the(whole enchilada) 2.6i Caravelle is
130,666(s.african$)
 My question is mainly- has anyone ordered the tranny and engine 
from S.Africa, how much was it? and any shipping particulars.
Any relevant leads appreciated,
Jay
