&gt; &gt; I realize this might sound like heresy to some, and flame bait to others,

&gt; OK.
&gt; I, being the list God have decided to split the vanagon list into two groups.
&gt; One will be a low priorty list -- I'll distribute evey once in a while.  
&gt; The other will continue to have this lovely lively discussion.
&gt; The split will be into these two groups.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. High priority list:
&gt;     Those people who sent $15 to rpalmer so I could have a nice T-Shirt 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Low priority list
&gt;     Those people who DIDN'T send rpalmer $15.
&gt; 
Sounds great!
Now everybody keep those $$$$$ rolling in so you can get your posts
posted positively properly and probably pretty promptly.
I'll be on the lookout.
BTW, ordered the shirts yesterday, they should be ready in a couple
weeks. Then I'm going to have a party to address/stuff 50-some envelopes
with all the shi--- I mean all the shirts!!
:)
Happy Friday all
