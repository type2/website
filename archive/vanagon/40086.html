Subject: Clean-up '81 Westy- Oil leaks (long)

This week I was able to Get all the tin off and start cleaning. The 
oil leak really did a number on the cooling system. The fan shroud 
and flaps were filled with oil, I had to take them all apart and gunk 
it out. Oil also found its way to the motor mounts and all will need 
to be replaced. I pulled the tranny and hope to bench test with the 
tranny attached to check for any other leaks. I replaced the oil 
cooler seals and the o-ring in the dip stick and will replace the 
rear main seal, already did the valve cover gaskets and pressure 
sender unit last year. 
Anybody know other possible oil leak spots to check?
While the motor is out I'm also working on the Exhaust system. I was 
amazed to find the original Cat conv. was still intact inside, but I 
fixed it. I will also need to weld some new hangers and a muffler 
mount. 
I'm still looking for someone with a California Model Vanagon to 
describe how the oil filter side tin fits on, any takers?
This one week job is streching to a major spring project!
