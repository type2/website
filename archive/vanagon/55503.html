Subject: vwdiesel mailing list


I have created a new mailing list specifically for VW diesel owners.  For us 
U.S. folks, this includes (as far as I know), the following diesel-powered 
vehicles:

Dasher/Passat
Rabbit/Golf/Rabbit Pickup
Jetta/Vento/Estate
Vanagon/Transporter

People who have other vehicles I'm not aware of are more than welcome to join 
too.  Owners of the fancy-schmancy new TDI cars are welcome too, though I don't 
know how much expertise will be around for you.  Most (OK, all) of my expertise 
is with pre-A3 (i.e. pre-1993) diesels, and especially A1 series Rabbits.

I'm hoping it will be a pretty low-volume list (especially since my mailing list 
software doesn't support digest mode quite yet).  Right now the list is 
extremely low volume, since I'm the only subscriber, though I'd imagine that 
Trey will be jumping right in as soon as he gets his injector problems taken 
care of. :)

To subscribe, send a message to:

vwdiesel_at_pas.rochester_dot_edu

with the following command in the BODY of the message:

ADD address vwdiesel

(where &quot;address&quot; is a valid internet email address)

As a side note, I'm looking for a diesel Vanagon in reasonably good condition 
(i.e. solid body, engine, fuel pump).  Anyone looking to part with one?  

- Tom
