It's a bit of topic for this group but I thought I'd pass it along....

This was in today's (Fridays) San Jose Mercury, if anyone's interested.......

&gt;VW '42 WWII German Jeep. Partially &gt;restored, many extras. $4995 obo
&gt;293-3973

Now, I rang about this and it is a kubel but a project.  The guy has a
'partially restored' 42 body on a standard 56 chassis, but he has the offset
kingpins and the rear gearbox etc that would make it 'nearly' original. He's
got a spotlight and blackout lights etc......basically he claims its ALL there
and it just has to be put together.  He bought it back from Greece in 72......
