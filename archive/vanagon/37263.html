Subject: Pomona swap meet?


did anybody out there go to the auto swap meet this weekend?  boy was it 
crouded.  they had so many people out there, that they could no longer 
let folks in to show there cars off.  i was one of those unluck ones.  i 
am still trying to sell my 75 westy.  if anybody wants one in the So Cal 
area.  i am very negotiable and need to sell it.

take care and God Bless
matt
