&lt;&lt; I am putting a rebuilt engine into my '81.  Several people (including the
 parts manager at VW) have told me I would be better off not bothering with
 the thermostat.  Some have said to just wire the flappers open.  The guy at
 VW said to just remove the flappers completely.&lt;&lt;

Some people agree and some disagree with the line of thinking that &quot;if the
cheapskates at VW engineered it into the car, ya better keep it.&quot; I report to
the platoon of beleivers.

After two 914's and two busses, and having spent a year as a motor builder
for a custom VW shop, I would STRONGLY RECCOMEND KEEPING the thermostat and
associated flaps. I can't think of a good reason to get rid of it. You can't
improve your cooling by getting rid of the thermo, and will SEVERELY DEGRADE
your cooling if you REMOVE THE FLAPS.

This system does nothing more than help the motor achieve operating temp. The
thermostat &quot;opens&quot; at around 250 F, and your cooling air tends to hit this
within five mins with the thermo in place. Like most machinery, your van
operates best at &quot;operating temp&quot;, so what's the issue?

If anything, I would TEST the thermo (see Haynes manual for specs), and
REPLACE it if it doesn't do its thing. I just finished a rebuild on my wife's
new daily driver, a '76 2.0 bus and spent the $$$'s for a new thermo and
attatchment wire. To increase coolin, we added an Empi 8-pass oil cooler
(mounted under the bus, behind left rear wheel) and oil thermostat. If you
need more cooling, cool the lifeblood!!!

If you must disconnect the thermo, leave the flaps, BTW there is no need to
&quot;wire&quot; them open, the little spring on top of the fan housing holds them in
the MAX cool position in case the thrmo fails.

best of luck, and safe motoring
