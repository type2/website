Both my Wanagons are low mileage beasts (80 131K, 84 Westy 82K), but on it's
4th engine and 3rd transaxle, my 67 Deluxe 21 Wdw has over 307K (I'm Original
Owner and its currently undergoing it's 3rd restoration since purchased on
June 7, 1967)

I agree - they're made to be DRIVEN, not pampered like some prima-donna.
