Subject: alternator?

I left my 85 WestyGL  running lights on and had to get a jump, I ran it for only 
about ten minutes and then cut it off...it had to be jumped 
again...then ran for about 30 minutes and still won't start again 
without a jump...is this an alternator problem? Thanks for any 
advice,
Rick
