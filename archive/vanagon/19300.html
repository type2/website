Spraying?  If you don't mean dripping, then I would think your master is 
giving lots of pressure.  I've never seen brake fluid &quot;spray&quot;.  Have 
you removed the bleeder screw and cleaned it really well?  When I first 
tried to bleed mine, nothing happened because it was totally plugged.  
What does your pedal feel like during all of this?
