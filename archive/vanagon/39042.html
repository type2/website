Subject: Gonzo Mechanix on the 85

Well, the inevetiable nexus of a series of engine noise 
queries.. The diagnosis: Rebuild. Replacement would 
eventually lead to same, given the used state of the 
engine.. 
	So now it's big time! I've survived leaking gas tanks, 
motors falling out, oil pumps sticking, brake cylinders 
failing, door latches flapping... So far, only impact 
velocities have allowed me to kill one of these vw's..

	Now, Here's My Excuse For Unpreparedness:
Well, my bug had an inoperable hood lock.
I had my tools in there. Emphasis on _had_. 
I now have a working lock, and a passable tool set.

Now, to the point: What speciality widgets would be best 
for helping me get this water box down, out, &amp; open? I 
mean things like clutch/tranny holding rods, oil pump 
pullers I've heard of, but some of you have experience 
yanking these things..
I just want to save a few cuss words by getting fully 
prepped before I set to things..
I hope August isn't too optimistic for completion.. :?

lots of lost weekends- hense Gonzo Mechanix-get it?
