&gt;specifically where you were?)  Anyway, being in Sac, I've been toying
&gt;with the idea of somehow rigging in the A/C ducting from a Vanagon bus
&gt;into my '91 camper so that I can get cool A/C to the front!  Is that

i saw, in one of the german books, some a/c ducting that ran down the sides
of the bus roof ... you might be about to get hold of the front overhead
console (for 86 and later buses) and fit some plastic pipe down the sides
to the back a/c unit. i have no idea how you'd get the rear single a/c to
blow down boths sides, thought.
