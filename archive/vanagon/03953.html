&gt; 
&gt; what's happening, people??
&gt; 
&gt; joel the confused
&gt; &lt;oh, mama, can this really be the end?
&gt; to be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?&gt; :)
&gt; 
Joel, I think the problem might be that you listen to too much Bob 
Dylan.  Anytime you can quote like that you are in trouble.  When are 
you gonna cut your hair and get a real job and stop listenin' to those
hippies sing about peace and love and other tragic items of no import?
See below.  :)  Jim
