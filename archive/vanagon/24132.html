O.K., before I get flamed about the Wailaki thing, let me give you some
reasoning on why I figured it was this past weekend.
1. I didn't pay attention to the initial information on the trip because I
didn't plan to be there.  2. The directions I read said things like; &quot;we're
going to leave at 10:00am on Friday&quot;.  3. I didn't see any reports on how the
trip went last week.  4. Martha ( I think ) did mention how well some shower
thing worked - but said that it hadn't been tested while actually camping
yet.  5. I figured that Labor Day weekend being a 3 day weekend and all would
be a natural time to plan a camping trip.
All this led up to me guessing that you'd be there.  I figured I couldn't be
600 miles from home, 22 miles from a gathering, and not stop to say hi.

Oh well, that said: Where (or when) were you???

Missing you,
Jim Davis
