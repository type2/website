Subject: RE:  91 Synchro Questions  - Reliability of VW engines, etc.

Steve,

My observations are based on talking w/an import parts/auto
engineer/race track owner/aircraft engine importer friend, and two other
mechanics w/experience w/the vanagon wasserboxer.  The auto engineer
thinks the vanagon engine is like &quot;a science-fair project to convert an
aircooled engine to water cooled.&quot;  He loves the crazy head gaskets, &quot;oh
no, couldn't make a flat gasket &amp; gasket surfaces so both head &amp;
cylinder can be milled, oh no, of course not&quot;.

They advise me to get rid of my '87 synchro and laugh that I'm tied to
it emotionally.  &quot;Machines have no emotions, they're good or not good. 
Vanagon engines aren't.&quot;

I have also read in this list that the viscous coupling is WAY expensive
to fix/replace.  Over time, it has become clear from the vanagon list
that the vehicles present a line of painful problems.  Bleeding the
cooling system?  Tilt front end 41&quot; up or whatever, do a one-footed
dance chanting &quot;bubbles be gone&quot;.  This kind of foolishness isn't found
on other vehicles.  (Well, there was the V-6 Vega where you loosen &amp;
lift the engine to replace the rear spark plugs.  So they became V-4s
after xx,000 miles, w/the original rear plugs looking like sparklers on
the 5th of July.  or JAGUARS  hahahahaha.)

Then, in the face of that kind of information is the way we love our
vans!!!  Recently there was a post that JD Power (the people who poll
car buyers) found that vanagon owners were 2d only to some Ford van for
owner satisfaction after owning 5 years.  (Think that may have been
skewed, since Chrysler owners all trade for the newer, swoopy model &lt;3
years out, except those who like warped alum. heads and the nice white
smoke trails they make.)

You know, I never really liked the Dead, but sure as hell like &amp; liked
Hendrix, Cream, CS&amp;N, et als.  Connection to VW vans?
