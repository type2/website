Subject: Addendum to post 'Travails of towing huge house trailer'

(This is a followup to my followup of the Vanagon towing a
huge motor home.)
I've received several very nice questions about my post.
1. The original poster (damn memory, can't remember)
   intended the 'travailing' pun.
2. I consider the '87 Wolfsburg a 'sleeper', not a camper
   like the Westfalia. When I said 'camper', I meant pop-up
   camper.
3. We dropped to 30 mph up the steepest part of highway 70,
   going east. The west bound Eisenhower pass is the
   steepest, I think. 30 mph not towing the camper, just
   with about 4700 lbs of the Wolfsburg, luggage and people.
4. The poster who maintained 50 mph up the steepest parts of
   highway 70, in a '91 GL, with the ac on, must have a
   better condition vanagon than me, which is quite
   possible.
5. We did without ac. It doesn't work and I didn't fix it. I
   wouldn't fix it. I'd tear it out and put a 120 v ac
   generator and house electricity, camper type, ac on the
   roof. My duct work got pulled down and my interior
   plastic area for the rear speakers and condenser is
   busted. I'd just pull all that ac stuff out. I don't
   think the vehicle has enough power for ac, and the
   conversions and expense of fixing the ac would be cheaper
   and better to just put a generator and 120 v ac on the
   roof or something or do without.
 Thanks for the responses. Russ Gilbert
