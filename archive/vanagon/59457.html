Subject: Re: Low mileage 81 Westy for sale

It seems that yourself and quite a few other people were as surprised
and or amused as I was to hear of that deal. My curiousity got the best
of me and I went to Smith VW to check it out for my self. I was informed
by Pat Smith that he had already accepted a $500 deposit toward the
asking price of $7900. . The Westy was quite nice but.
