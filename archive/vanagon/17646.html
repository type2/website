Jeeze Gerry!  Have a heart.  What do you expect us to do?  You can't
just leave people &quot;dangling&quot; like that  :( - I hope you're planning
on providing some psychadelic/hallucinagenic substances to tide
us over during the withdrawal.

Nervous, twitching, and sweaty,
/m

    Plan on driving to the Dead show in Las Vegas that day, then.
