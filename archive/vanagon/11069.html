Subject: Re: [A] 73 1700 push rod tube question ...

I've been reading all the talk regarding this pushrod tube seal business and in 
the spirit of verbosity need to throw in my 2 cents:

I just did this operation on my '82 2.0l type IV motor, so all should be the 
same. I operated on the patient with the motor in the car. The operation was 
successfull and have had no leaks so far. IMHO, these heads were designed so you
could change these seals without removing the heads.

Upon recommendation, I used &quot;Viton&quot; seals (they're black). You have to ask for 
them by name, but  I've found the better air-cooled shops carry them. Viton is 
great stuff that stands up to prolonged high temperatures far better than the 
the normal seal material. Notice how those old ones were hard and crusty? Not 
viton...still pliable after years of use. Space technology, man. On my type I 
motors I used to use the regular ones, and they'd always leak after a couple of 
years.


I don't know why your tubes are loose. Do you have the right seals? Shims under 
your rockers? Hmmm...those suckers should stay in there. You can turn them, but 
not take them out when your done!

&gt; Hey all. I am in the process of putting our 73 Westy's engine back together,
&gt; and am having some trouble with the pushrod tubes. The engine in the 1700
&gt; type IV.
&gt; After replacing the seals on both ends of the tubes, I passed them through
&gt; the rocker box, and into the holes in the engine block. The problem is, 
&gt; even with the head torqued down properly, they are not really tight into the
&gt; engine. I can pop them out without too much effort. I'm wondering what
&gt; actually holds them in ... the long bent wire that goes in with the rocker
&gt; arms seems to press up against them inside the rocker box, but is this it?
&gt; It also seems that you could remove these tubes with the engine in the bus
&gt; by just removing the rocker arms, and pulling the tubes out, is this true?
&gt; Any ideas would be much appreciated. I'm just worried that the tubes are
&gt; going to pop out of place with the engine running (or leak!).
