Subject: Gas prices Uk..read and weep!

Yeah well a gallon over here costs about 4.20 US dollars. Thank god we don't
plan to do 2500 miles in an RV over here! Europe is even more expensive for
gas (petrol).
Have been driving Hals 1303S...does less than 20 to the gallon (I think I
enjoyed the power and acceleration)..but back to the bus and 29 to the gallon
tomorrow......
