Am I the only one who feels good when reading about another person falling 
in love with VW's?   I'd like to know about VW vehicles not sold in the US. 
 Does anyone know anything about a VW sport utility vehicle sold in South 
America?  I read that it has an engine designed to burn whatever 
alcohol/gasoline fuel blend they use down there.

Live long, make friends, be happy....
