&gt; The only real problem with it right now, is that sometime during the
&gt; last four months, it smells like a whole herd of cats took up residence
&gt; inside! (it sat open to the elements for some time) I was checking for 
&gt; rust spots under the floor mat up front, and there was some water (I 
&gt; think it was water!) under it that smelled to high heaven!  I wiped it up 
&gt; and dried the area off, but the smell won't go away.  I tried treating it 
&gt; with everything from lysol to bleach, but so far no luck.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think would work best?

Congratulations on your success with your camper - it's nice to hear a
story where the good guy wins for a change!  As for the smell, if there
is any carpeting at all that smells, replace it.  I have found that once
carpeting is &quot;treated&quot; by a cat, nothing will clean it.  period.  The
only other thing I would recommend is simple green.  I have had great
success with simple green cleaning my van.  In severe situations you can
just spray it on straight even though they tell you to dilute it to something
like 10 to 1.
