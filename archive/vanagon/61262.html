Matt:
There are two reasons why the light will flash.
I&gt;The temp sender. There are two senders. One for the gauge and one for
the computer. 
II&gt; The coolant reservoir level sensor. When the level falls BELOW the
two contacts the light will flash. I have heard that the incorrect
antifreeze-to-water ratio will affect the light also.
 I would also check the voltage stabilizer in the instrument pod and the
ground clusters behind the fuse block

&gt;HELP
&gt;	OK so we now have changed the temp sender in the thermostat on 
&gt;big 
&gt;sister (Elizabeth)'s 84 westie. Still the little red light is a 
&gt;flashing. That is untill we disconect the sender and off goes the 
&gt;light. Oh sure it takes a lot longer for the temp guage to make it's 
&gt;climb but the result is the same. While triing to locate the temp 
&gt;guage control unit(suggested by Dan Fuller Thx) sis noticed the large 
&gt;greem lake coming from the refill tank (poor girl her hair is starting 
&gt;
&gt;to come out in handfulls).As stated before we have bled Betty way to 
&gt;many times to be funny anymore and I am afraid that sis may soon bail 
&gt;on repair and just start to groove on that funky little light.
&gt;	If anyone has any other ideas we would like to try them 
&gt;soon.(I mean 
&gt;SOON) Elizabeth has been at my house for a week and my wife is on the 
&gt;edge.
&gt;
&gt;TIA
