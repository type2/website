Hello -
This following post reminds me a problem I would like to correct.
Can one fix/replace the fuel sending unit on an '80 Westi without 
dropping the tank?  Mine registers but at about 1/2 tank (real) the 
gauge reads E.

Related subject:
Not having a reliable gas gauge is a nuisance, but it's a whole lot 
better now that I fixed the odometer too.
  
BTW an generic VW odometer PM task for when everything else is up to 
snuff: The drive gear driving the odo is weak and easily splits.  
Check it and wrap the hub with string embedded in epoxy to prevent it 
from breaking.  Had to combine 3 dash units to 
get one useable odometer/speedometer/wiring harness to work.

&gt; A while back, Erik asked about fuel sender units:
&gt;   &quot;Is there any way of testing it before I reinstall the whole tank?&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;   I expect the normal electrical continuity through movement range test 
&gt; was related to ALL, but a nice trick that should be used when it applies 
&gt; to high milage vehicle designs, is to flip the wire wound resistance 
&gt; sensor coil over before the mobil contact paw abrades all the way through 
&gt; any of the wire wraps. This generic approach applies to hundreds of 
&gt; vehicle designs and doubles their effective life.  On some, just bending 
&gt; the contact paw so that it rubs the coil in a different arc will do.  The 
&gt; idea's the same: Don't let it wear all the way through any single wire 
&gt; wrap, and it will keep on serving you well.
