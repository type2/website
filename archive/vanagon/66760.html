Subject:      Re: Dometic gas cooling problems

&gt; I've got the no cooling on gas but works OK on 120VAC problem with my
&gt; Dometic refrigerator.  The exhaust tubes are clear, the burner and jet
&gt; (#24) are clean, the regulator is working OK (11.5&quot;WC), the bypass
&gt; orifice on the thermostat is clean, the burner lights OK, and the flame
&gt; is a nice blue color but not real bright.  the thermostat changes the
&gt; size of the flame when it is adjusted.  I also have the small 12V Radio
&gt; Shack fan mounted on top of the evaporator unit inside the refrigerator.
&gt; The external fan cycles some while running on gas but runs more while
&gt; running on 120VAC.
&gt;
&gt; The thing just doesn't seem to want to get any colder than 50 degrees
&gt; (with 70 degrees outside temperature) while operating on gas although it
&gt; will cool to 27 degrees F while running on 120VAC.  What's going on?
&gt; What else could I check?

It sounds like a problem with the gas burner.  I believe the flame
height should be about 1.5'-2&quot;.  Probably not enough gas reaching the
burner, due to restrictions somewhere between the gas supply connection
and burner.  There is a pressure test port at the outlef of the thermostat
itself.  Per Bob at Dometic tech support, the pressure at this point
should vary from 2&quot;-11&quot; WC as the T'stat is turned from min to max.  If
you have these pressures here, the likely cause would be a restricted
orifice at the burner (whether it looks clean or not).

I suggest you call Dometic Tech Support at (219) 463-4858.  You'll likely
get voice mail and may have to call a couple of times to get them to call
back, but they're generally pretty helpful once you speak to them.

You might also want to check out the following web site for some good
background information on these types of fridge and some excellent color
photos:

&gt; I'm going to increase the circulation behind the cabinet with a couple of
&gt; 3&quot; Radio Shack fans in addition to the original fan.  Does anyone know if
&gt; it is possible to keep the fins on the back TOO cool for the system to
&gt; operate efficiently?

In theory, yes.  In practice, probably not.  Once again, you might want to
ask the folks at Dometic.

&gt; Any suggestions?
