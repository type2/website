Subject: Re: fridge questions

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I've got a couple more questions about the Dometic fridge in my '81
&gt; Westy.  This past weekend I did a &quot;test-run&quot; of the fridge to make sure
&gt; it was up to the upcoming camping trip.  Well, with outside temperatures
&gt; in the 40s and inside temperatures probably in the high 60s to low 70s
&gt; (electric heater) the fridge inside temperature was hovering between 40
&gt; and 50 degrees F.  This was with the temperature control turned to max.
&gt; I would hope and assume that the fridge would be able to get below those
&gt; temperatures with that kind of ambient temp, especially with the
&gt; thermostat control on max.  When I put my hand over the grille inside
&gt; the van, between the counter and the wall, I could feel the heat from
&gt; the fridge.  It seemed pretty warm, as you would expect.  However, I
&gt; think the fan that is mounted back on the coils should have come on.
&gt; This fan didn't come on at all when the fridge was running.
&gt; 
I haven't investigated the wiring to this fan, but during our two 
week trip last April in Or &amp; Ca, with outside temps from 40 -70 f, 
running on propane &amp; 12v the fridge worked like a charm. In fact the 
2nd or 3rd day in, after leaving the fridge on max, we awoke to 
frozen milk!
I know the fan does work as it comes on it hot weather, but I don't 
recall it ever coming on during this trip, since it was cool outside.
Also experience since then has shown the gas to be more efficent than 
110v, by maybe 25%. 
Have you cleaned behind the fridge? Sounds like maybe the coil are 
clogged up?
