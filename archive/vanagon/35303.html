Subject: Re: Renting camper in Germany

Hi, David-
In my line of business I like to keep tabs on the competition, even if it be
overseas. . .
I know of two companies that rent campers in Amsterdam, and I also have a
copy of an interesting magazine published in Germany: Freizeit Mobile/Mobile
Life.  I'd be glad to send you a photocopy of the ad section-there are many
companies listed, and I think some rent.
Oh, and this offer of photocopied ad pages is good for anyone. E-mail me your
address.

P.S. Did you know that the REIMO company made a Westfalia-like camper out of
Chrysler minivans? My copy of FM/ML has an article on them.
