Subject: Vanagon front seat with arm rests wanted



I would like replace my 84 drivers side front seat with one of the later
seats with arm rests.  Local (Portland, OR) wreckers want about $250 which
is too much.  Does anyone out there have some seats for a reasonable
price or have ideas for contacts?  I could do a swap as I have a spare 84 
Westy interior.
