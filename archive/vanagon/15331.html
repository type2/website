&gt;Since I have just gotten on this group, was the problem of &quot;carb icing&quot; with
&gt;fuel injected engines discussed earlier? I had this problem and nearly drove
&gt;me nuts until a regional service rep let me know what was happening. Cleared
&gt;at no cost under the 50k mile pollution deal.

what was this all about?? tell us!! :)

&gt;Also experiencing a VERY loud noise from the radiator fan. Can't find any
&gt;obvious problems like interference. Are the bearings a problem in the fan?

i had this problem on my 86 bus ... VERY loud fan. not a screeching noise,
but just when the fan came on, it was very very loud. scared the hell outa
pedestrians. :)  it was like it had only one speed, and that was high speed.
the dealer never did care to even examine it, saying &quot;they all do that.&quot;
yeah, right: my 88 is very quiet and has NEVER gotten as loud as that 86.

i suspect (in hindsight) a bad thermo-switch on the radiator. maybe a lousy
fan.
