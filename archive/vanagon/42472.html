&gt; Has any one ever used this thing before?  It is a big bag of water that heats
&gt; up from  solar energy that is hung from a high object.  There is also a 
&gt; privacy enclosure that can be hung around below the bag of water.  Each of 
&gt; these were 19.99

Martha has tried a few of these things.  The latest is a kind of large 
maybe shoeboxed sized thingie that you can heat up on the propane stove
or fire and then pump the water up a tube and take a hot shower.  

Personnally, I think she's just waiting for Hansel &amp; Gretel to come
along.....   ;)
