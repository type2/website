Subject: Re: checking specs inside the engine


&gt; So, has anyone else done this soul searching before? Dyer? Has anyone
&gt; purchased a dial indicator set? How do you replace the flywheel and
&gt; test the crankshaft end play without this set? If I could get some
&gt; mind numbingly detailed email, that would be great - I am in digest
&gt; mode, so I will see global responses tomorrow.
&gt; 

Well, yes, In fact I have been doing this soul searching about a lot of
things lately.  Do it yourself vs. let the shop do it.

Do it yourself
--------------

Advantages:

You learn how everything works, that is, if you research everything well.

Assuming that you have good mechanical skills and that you are careful, you
know that everything is done well, with good parts, and correctly.

You don't have to pay for labor charges.

Disadvantages:

You may lack some of the skills you need without being aware of this deficiency
and may do some of the jobs less than professionally.

IT TAKES TIME!!!  It may never get done

You may do yourself harm working with drills, paint, heavy parts, etc. etc.


Have the shop do it
-------------------

Advantages:

Generally, the job gets it done quicker.

A master mechanic may do a better job because he/she has more experience
and better tools

Perhaps a guarantee.

Disadvantages:

A mediocre mechanic may do a poorer job because he/she doesn't have enough
experience or is trying to cut corners in materials or time spent.

Labor is often about $45 per hour for this type of work.

I generally end up doing what I can myself.

I need to build/have built an engine for my 66 bus and it is very temping
to start with a rebuilt longblock.  This problem is, I just don't trust
very many of the rebuilt longblocks I see available and the ones I do trust
are fairly expensive (at the minimum, GEX, but I would prefer Gene Berg).
On the other hand, I don't have much spare time to select and order the pieces
and then build the engine.

About setting end play.  I am very fortunate that the place I work has a well
equiped machine shop used for building telescopes and instrumentation and I
am able to borrow things like dial indicators and micrometers over weekends.
I think you should be able to set something up so that you could use a feeler
guage to set the end play...

Cheers,

 -Dyer
