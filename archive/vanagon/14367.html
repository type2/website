&gt; I can only say that with all of this you will need a trailer and bus top
&gt; carrier. Besides where is the adventure with all this.  Next you will want
&gt; a shower.;-).

Nope. I managed to get it all in or on my '89 Westfalia, along with
4 happy campers/canoers and a Igloo(tm) fulla hoagies and Gatorade(tm).
