&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me what a fair price is for an early '80s
&gt; Vanagon air box and wiper motor?  I'm in a relatively isolated
&gt; area, and have no access to either VWoA or a wrecking yard that
&gt; knows anything about such critters. 
&gt; 

The last time I priced an AFC for the 81 they were ~$350 new with fair 
market value being something less than half for a used one.  Call Blake's 
Small Car Salvage in Erie, Colorado (970 exchange) for a more accurate 
accessment.  Can't help you on the wiper motor but I'm betting they could 
as well.

Jack
