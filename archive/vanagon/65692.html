Subject:      Stuck odometer

Need some advice fellow listees,

My odometer and trip counter stopped the other day. The speedometer
cable is still turning because it registers the speed. I stopped for gas
and reset the trip counter as I always do. When I started to drive away,
I notice that the neither the odometer nor the trip counter were
working.

If I push the trip counter reset button in part of the way and hold it
just far enough so as to not reset the counter, they will both work.

So, before I take the guage housing assembly appart, has anyone
encountered this before &amp; if so, is there an easy fix? Do I need to take
the guage assembly apart, is the trip counter dead and in need of
replacement?

Wish this problem would happen on my leased car that has a mileage
limitation on it!
