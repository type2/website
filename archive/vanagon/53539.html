Subject: VolksBooks: Volume 1, Issue 5


Volks:

	The latest issue of VolksBooks is ready, however the new
message size limits on both lists do not permit I to post the entire
Bibliography in one shot.  While I devise a logical means of splitting
VolksBooks into sections/chapters that will meet the imposed law of
the land, you can contact I offline if you want a copy
[Roy.Nicholl_at_ASG.unb_dot_ca].

	I have also sent a copy to Ken for inclusion in the
archives and/or his Web site...this may turn out to be the means of
distributing the list in the future [to cut down on bandwidth].  I am
also working on my own Perl-based query interface that will allow you
to search the database from which I generate VolksBooks...however,
given that the database is on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of our firewall [from
your perspective as the &quot;Netzen&quot;, I have a few issues to workout.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
