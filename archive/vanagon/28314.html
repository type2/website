Subject: Re: Front heat problem '85 

&gt;Does anybody have a clues as to why my front heater fan doesn't work 
&gt;right? It will occasionally go on a few minutes into a drive and then 10 
&gt;minutes later it will start to &quot;die&quot;. It will start to slow down, and in 
&gt;a few minutes it will quit. It won't start up again until it feels like 
&gt;it. Usually a few days later Same thing every time. I think my parent's 
&gt;checked it out at the dealer once and the dealer said that we needed a 
&gt;new ($$$$) fan. Too much money.
&gt;
&gt;It seems more like the problem would be electrical. I tried a new switch, 
&gt;but the same thing would happen.
&gt;
If I were a betting man I'd put my money on the blowers brushes. Why does it
come on when you drive down the road. Well the vibration giggles the worn
brushes against the commutator for another go at it, then after the motor
runs for a few minutes it starts losing full contact and begins to slow
down. Most likely the complete blower motor will need to be replaced. The
brushes are usually available seperately and even when they are the arcing
caused by the worn brushes does quite a bit of damage.

Now if you're willing brushes can be found, commutators returned, MAYBE.
Anyway it's a bit of work to change the blower motor so you pays your money
etc....

Let us know what you find/and do about it. That's the &quot;price&quot; for free
advice &lt;g&gt;.
