&gt;
&gt;People,
&gt;
&gt;I found out from our version of the Inland Revenue that if I import a
second hand commercial vehicle I only have to pay IRP40 for re-registration.
That have make me think about getting one in the UK as a replacement for
blue thing.
&gt;
&gt;Nice folks that you all are, could you chat to your local dealers to see
what a '93 1.9 diesel SWB T4 would be?  And a '93 LWB 2.4 for that matter.
The reg letter is irrelevant as we start in January and register by the
calender year.
&gt;
&gt;TIA, nice people.
