Subject: Re: VW bus safety (was: back from the dead)


&gt;I always tell myself when I'm driving my '59 that I have no brakes, no 
&gt;acceleration, no handling, no airbag, no lights, no nothing, so NO 
&gt;CRASHING ALLOWED.


Sounds good-- I'm convinced.

Now if you can just convince the drunk in the oncoming lane who's about
to swerve into you, or the guy with the cell phone, I'll forget the whole
issue.

But if not, I'll *still* keep driving my '71, and just remain aware that
the world isn't a safe place.
