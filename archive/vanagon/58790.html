&lt;&lt; Question: Shouldn't this first repair have lasted at least more than 25K?
 
 Also, the dealer is saying they may have to replace the heads again, maybe
 not.  After only 25K, does that sound like it's believable.  They won't know
 'til they open her up.
 
 Price quoted is roughly $1,300 for the gasket job and roughly $400 per head

Sounds like the dealer jerkin' you around BIG TIME.
I think you need to seek another opinion.... new heads after 25k??  come
on.....
who did the head gasket job at the dealer?? frick and frack??

don't be another gullible statistic......
