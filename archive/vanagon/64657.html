Bob,

I'll probably follow the suggestions of fellow listserv member, Bill
Dummitt, and put it behind the passenger seat.  I'll try to build it off
the ground about level with the back seat, since the floor of our
Westfalia gets totally packed with stuff when we're camping.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just wanted to let you know that the area code for the number for Thermo
&gt; &gt; Systems Inc., that's posted in the VW FAQ, has been changed.  The new
&gt; &gt; number is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 360/352-0539
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The company sells the only vented catalytic heaters which can be
&gt; installed
&gt; &gt; in motor homes/Vans.   fyi -- current price is $339.95 if purchased
&gt; &gt; directly from the company.  It includes the heater, a thermostat, exhaust
&gt; &gt; and intake vents.
