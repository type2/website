Hey all,
Regarding t4mempteered bgalass versus safety glass, Isn't
safety glass used for windshields while tempered glass is still used for
side windows?

You can shatter a side window esasily and it will shatter into little
pebbles but windshields which a re laminatd on obboth sides don't
shatter.

Thoughts?

Sean
