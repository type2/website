Subject:  What do ya think? Eurovan Problem Tracking Database

  Owning a EV, I know they follow in the Vanagons footsteps for being=20
EXTREMELY expensive to repair and service.

I think this is a good idea and would support it with information about =
my own EV. I wonder, however; with the low number of EV owners on the =
list, would the compiled results be statistically significant? Would it =
be possible to draw erroneous conclusions based on insufficient data?
