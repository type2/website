Subject: '82 Vanagon diesel Westy

I'm being offered a 1982 Vanagon diesel Westphalia.It has undeniably 67,000
original miles.I haven't seen a cleaner vanagon of this vintage ever.the sink,
stove and fridge have not been used.The engine is clean enough to eat off
of and starts on the first revolution of the starter.It has its original
tires (Conti's)and you can see the paint (shiny) on all of the chassis
members.It was donated to the American Cancer Society and ended up _at_ a
local auction. It has no rust spots any where.Could any of you give me an
idea how much this beauty is worth? I am going to buy it for a ridiculously
low price but I'd like to know Its value.Also, any body interested in
this?I'm telling you; it is UNUSED!!!
  I already have a vanagon diesel (non-westy) and I can't keep the two of them.
Thanks for any and all information you might have on this .
