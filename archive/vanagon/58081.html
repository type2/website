Subject: Clutch repair survey

I,m replacing the clutch in a 1984 Westy &amp; am curious about working on the
flywheel and replacing the seal.
1.  Local experts range from don't replace the seal until it leaks to replace
it every time.

2.  Same answer range for flywheel.  From &quot;always have it machine&quot;, to &quot;they
hardly ever need anything.

For those that have replaced clutches how often does either job need to be
done?  Do you replace the seals &quot;as long as I'm there?&quot;  What criteria do you
use for flywheel machine?

Thanks.
