Hello,

	My name is Peter Ruggiero, I am studying coastal engineering at 
Oregon State University in Corvallis.  I also have an 80 Vanagon with a 
cracked valve seat.  The honorable Bill Hollings, list serve member, 
helped me drop my engine in a few short hours this weekend at the wave 
tanks we have here on campus.  It was quite a site. 
	 Well we got the first head off no problem 
and saw that yes indeed, there was a cracked valve seat.  However the 
second head seems stubbornly attached to the the cylinders and we even 
broke off a few cooling fins trying to tap the head off.  It is now 
soaking in WD40 and i will try again later today.  Are there any other 
suggestions about how to separate the two??

	My dilemna is this.  As a graduate student i am by default broke 
and busy.  At first I was thinking that I would do the heads only get 
compression back and pray for about 20K, or a year and a half until i get 
a job in which i can actually pay for repairs.  But then seeing the 
engine out and all the pieces laying all over the floor i got excited 
about doing more of a substantial rebuild.  I was going to have Mark 
Stevens rebuild the heads down in Tehatchipi as suggested by the 
listserve so I called down there today to see about prices.  I was 
informed of a shortage of pistons and cylinders for 2.0 liter engines and 
that he could not sell me any nor could i probably get them anywhere 
else. I was also told that a complete rebuild including the bottom end 
would be around $1500.  He could only give me pistons and cylinders if 
they were building me an engine. 

	So now i am coming full circle, do i do the heads only (if i can 
get that one off) and just wait and hope that nothing serious goes 
wrong.  Or do i bite the bullet and go the whole nine yards.  Mixed 
metaphors aside, I could really use some advice as my research cannot 
stay on hold forever while i pine away about my van.

thanx very much,

peter ruggiero

p.s.  no we are not working on the car in the wave tanks, just next to 
the wave tanks.
