Subject:       FRIDGE QUESTION

I AM NEW TO THIS LIST AND ALSO A NEW OWNER OF A VW, SO PLEASE FORGIVE 
ME IF MY QUESTION IS STUPID.  I JUST BOUGHT A 1975 CAMPER A FEW MONTHS
AGO AND MY QUESTION IS: WHEN I PLUG THE EXTENSION CHORD THAT COMES 
OUT OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE VAN AND TURN THE AC CONVERTER SWITCH ON 
THAT IS UNDER SEAT THE RED LIGHT WILL FLICKER FOR A WHILE AND 
EVENTUALLY FADE.  I CAN PLUG APPLIANCES INTO THE ELECTRICAL SOCKET IN 
THE VAN AND THEY WILL WORK.  THE FRIDGE HOWEVER WON'T COME ON.  IS IT 
DISCONNECTED FROM THE CONVERTER SOMEWHERE?  WHERE DO I LOOK IF THIS 
IS THE CASE?  IS THE FRIDGE JUST OLD AND DEAD?
