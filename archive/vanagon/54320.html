&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I saw an 88 Vanagon GL Camper in a parking lot the other day and looked
&gt;&gt; inside.
&gt;&gt; On top of the steering column, between the steering wheel and gages,  the
&gt;&gt; usual plastic cover piece was replaced by something I hadn't seen before.
&gt;&gt; The cover piece on this van had a large &quot;display&quot; like thing on it.  It wa
&gt;&gt; molded into the piece and must have come from the factory.  It protruded up
&gt;&gt; from the usual slope toward the gages and presented the driver with a 1.25&quot;
&gt;&gt; tall x 2&quot; wide rectangle that looked like it was dark red plastic.  Sort of
&gt;&gt; like a warning indicator or display of some sort.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Many cars now place their emergency flasher switch &amp; light in this
&gt;&gt;position,
&gt;&gt; but this van had those in the usual position on the right side of the
&gt;&gt; instrument binnacle with the defroster switch.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any one have any idea what this is?  I'm not too familiar with the Camper
&gt;&gt; models, but have looked them over in the past &amp; haven't noticed anything
&gt;&gt;like
&gt;&gt; this.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; By the way, the van has a manual tranmission and was not a Syncro.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Wondering,

&gt;
&gt;Was it a roller type switch that is the thermostat setting for a seat
&gt;heater? That is what I have on my '91.  Todd Francis
