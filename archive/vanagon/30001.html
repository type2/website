killian_at_qnet_dot_com asked:
:  Would double door in this case mean a left and right side door or the 
:  non-sliding hinged pair of doors on the passenger side?

Well, the description says ``dorrs on both sides''.  Presumably the
seller wouldn't feel it necessary to mention that there's both a
driver door and a passenger door ;-)

That's the extent of my knowledge about this particular bus.
