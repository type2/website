Hi All You Synkronuts,

'Figured I could get away with that entrance based on my transportation =
choice......   I really appreciate the invite to Red Rocks (have heard =
lotsa good things about it/want to &quot;participileate&quot; someday) and want to =
stay in touch with the hopes of getting a Synkro Tribal gathering =
together somewhere in the greater Bay Area (I've been thinking about =
this for a long time). =20

Unfortunately, my house, my body, and my SplitWindow Beetle are promised =
for that weekend to represent the VVWCA in a local &quot;shindig&quot; =
(boy-oh-boy, haven't heard that term since &quot;Groovy&quot; was the in thing to =
say) soooooo.....  Let's talk somemore about getting something together =
a bit later on.  What do you think about the Syncro Tribal gathering =
idea (even if it isn't a camping weekend)?  TIA for your input!!

			Jon Peters

P.S.  I'll have the Syncro Westie all &quot;decked-out&quot; with Split/Trailer in =
tow at the VVWCA Spring Meet this coming Sunday at Kelly Park in San =
Jose.  Great show for VW folks of all types;  hope to see you there!
