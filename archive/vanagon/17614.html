Subject: Wanted: Eurovan (Portland, OR)

     I am looking for a 93 Eurovan, light metallic blue, low miles, with 
     convenievce package in the Portland, OR area or within 300mi.  Only  
     MV's without weekender (pop top) package.  
     
     I know this is a pretty picky request.  I guess I'm just picky.
     
     Also, any advice on owning one of these beasts?
     
     Thanks,
     
     Roger Traylor
