Ok, there's what looks like an extra electrical socket about halfway 
between the cig lighter and the glove box.  Its maybe slightly larger 
than the headphone plug on a stereo amp.  I can't see behind it to look 
for wires. 

Doe's anyone know what it is?  If it is a plug,  what kinds of 
accessories fit it?  I'm pretty sure it isn't a pencil sharpener.
