Hi,

	Got back a few hours ago from the surf adventure.

	Wave size was incredible for this time of year in northern California,
6-10' in very consistent, frquent sets.  You need to be on a NW or so
facing beach, though - it was closing out bad at Pedro Point/Linda Mar.
Half Moon bay was slightly better.

	Got worked pretty good at both places bewfore I decided to hang it
up and just watch (30 holes of golf this week left me a little sore
to start with)  and I happy to see it wasn't me -nobody was riding- everyone
was going o'er the falls like crazy.  My specialized floatie takeoff wasn't
even working!

	Hung out, talked to some bus people, drove up and down Hwy 1 for a
bit.  The bus perfmormed perfectly, and quitely.

	We spendt the night, and it was warm enuf in the bus that I actually
had to open a window or 2.

	Bradley awakened us promptly at 7:00 or so with his new Vanagon
and brought coffee.  We shot the poop (pull!) for a while, and then I told
him where I'd found a rusted out bay window that was being parted out, so 
we drove down there.  His eyes lit up, as he started grabbing for seats,
glovebox latches and other goodies! 

	I continued down 1 to Half Moon bay again, and decided to go out again.
Smaller today, but better shape.  Got worked again.  I was too tired from
yesterday's flogging to do much better.  Only a few people were getting
good rides, so that made me feel better.   Hung out there for a while and
then packed up and headed home.

	Gotta go wash the salt spray off the bus now.  groan....

Thom
