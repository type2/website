Subject: Sometimes balky starter


&gt;I turn the key and nothing happens.  I try again, and starts
&gt;instantly.  My rebuilt one has even done it a couple of times
&gt;and its only two months old!  I'm starting to think something
&gt;besides the starter is at fault.

I've had that happen on a couple of different buses (upright
fan engine, '71 and older). Turned out it was the long wire
from the key switch to the starter solenoid. It's a push-on
connection to the solenoid, and it had loosened up. Pull it
off (notice how easily it comes off?? Hint), VERY GENTLY
squeeze it a little tighter with a pair of pliers, and push
it back on (have to push a little harder now, don't you?).
Oh, you might clean it up a little before you replace it.
End of problem, for me!

My $0.02. YMMV.
