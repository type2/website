&gt;     I *DIDN'T* check the condition of my valves on my '77 dual port and it 
&gt;     dropped a valve head on number 3 when I was 250 miles from home. The 
&gt;     engine ran perfectly though for the 8 months up to this point.
&gt;     
&gt;     Don't want to scare you but I would thoroughly check the engine if 
&gt;     you're going on a long trip.

How do you check for valve fatigue without taking the thing apart? I know
a repeatedly tight valve is a sign, but what else?  TIA!
