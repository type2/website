They'd better.  No offense to you, Dennis, but I have seen their shop and 
their work and I am not impressed.  The best set of rebuilt heads they could
find in their inventory were only barely acceptable to me.  Most of them had
incredibly sloppy welding and helicoils all over the place.  The last
thing you want to happen when you are driving in Saskatchewan (sp?) 200
miles from the nearest repair shop is for a spark plug to pop out of the
head.  Of course, this doesn't matter if you have a _warranty_, right?
Cause you can just call GEX up on the phone and they will send a tow
truck out, tow your bus in, replace the heads, tow it back, and buy you
dinner, right?  

GEX may have been a reputable source of rebuilt parts in the past, but 
I would be VERY careful about buying anything from them today.  Check
what you get very carefully.
