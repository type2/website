So Tim Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; The high lift jack is cheap and reliable and doesn't require 80-200 amps to 
&gt; work. Winch electrical hookup was enough to put me off the idea. 2nd 
&gt; battery, heavy wire everywhere, maybe a heavier alternator... Winching 
&gt; yourself out will drain a battery in short order. No fun if you can't start 
&gt; your van once you get back on solid ground. If you just want to get off 
&gt; slippery surfaces then a cheap block and tackle set, 1000lbs, 6 foot pull 
&gt; may suit. Packs away tightly also.
&gt; 

For those of us not so well informed of the nominclature you're using, could
you please explain what entails a block and tackle set.  Are you talking
about a come-along (hand winch) with some rope and hooks?
