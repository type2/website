Subject: RE: Rear axle nuts

&gt;From: Randy &lt;thewoz!wort!randy_at_netcom_dot_com&gt;

&gt; I too have been trying to take the rear axle nuts off of my
&gt; '76 Bus.  Are they 42mm or 46mm?
&gt; 
&gt; I am having a hell of a time trying to find 42mm (or 46mm)
&gt; sockets... any ideas?  I can get non-metric sockets at Sears
&gt; that are kind of close (I guess 1 11/16 is pretty close to
&gt; 42mm, and 1 13/16 is close to 46mm).
&gt; 
&gt; As far as getting the rear drums off once you've got the
&gt; hub off, I've seen a guy just bang on them a few times with
&gt; a rubber hammer and they come loose.

I cannot remember what size nut we have on the Vanagon but I have used
non-metric sockets.  My father and I have a large selection of non-metric
tools for using on stuff that is over 25mm / 1 inch in size.  Once you go
past that size I don't think that it will matter if you are not using the
right size as long it is not too loose and you use sockets or the closed
end wrenches.  This has worked out for us fine.
 
As for places to get tools you may want to check for tool dealers such as
Snap-On in your area.  That's where we get our large sized tools.
