Okay,  everyone is talking about seating positions, number of seats etc.

After a concert one night, I drove 27 passengers + myself twelve or 
thirteen blocks to a subway station (not to mantion I had a 20 Gal. fish 
tank in the back).
It was tight and we ran out of seatbelts after 7   :)
Anyone here ever driven with more than that?

If you plan on trying to beat this...  Don't even think about being able 
to get higher than second gear,  and make sure your brakes are in good 
shape (you really have to push them to stop a load like that).
