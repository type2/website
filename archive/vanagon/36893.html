Subject: Headlight oddity


The headlights on the V6anagon (sorry to cause offense, Jim) have been
acting a little strange: after being on for 1/2 hour or so during a
long night trip, they lose power. Later they come back on, and then go
off again, etc.

I had this happen to an old Mustang once-- problem was a circuit breaker
in the headlight switch that was old and slightly overloaded. But for the
V6anagon, Bentley doesn't show any such circuit breaker.

Anybody had any experience with such behavior? Any advice would be welcome
before I roll up the sleeves and rip into it. I privately wonder if the
PO who installed the Chevy engine, might have wired a few things to the
nearest convenient switched-power source, which was maybe the headlights,
and now the circuit is taking out its anger on me.
