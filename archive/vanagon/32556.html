Subject: C Codes for VW Type II (long)

     Coffee Codes for VW Type II
     (with apologies to  David Easterwood, Tom Brouillette,
     Mary Smith, and actually, the entire rest of the list)


     Barndoors:

     C10 Enamel pot with cover. For each cup of coffee, use jackhandle to
     pound 1 tbs beans on the roadside asphalt into smithereens. Put
     coffee directly into water and boil for twenty minutes. Pour slowly.
     Recalled by American Cancer Society.

     C11.  Deluxe model only. Enamel pot, cover, and hammer. For each cup of
     coffee, use hammer to pound 1 tbs beans on the roadside asphalt into
     smithereens. Follow instructions above.


     Later Splits:

     C20. Percolator, blue enamel, with glass bulb in top.  For each cup of
     water, put 1 tsb ground coffee into percolator basket plus one &quot;for
     the pot&quot;, assemble on riser, and put cover over basket. Put on high
     heat until water is visibly percolating into glass bulb on top. Turn
     down heat, but do not allow percolation to stop. Percolate for 5
     minutes.

     C21. Percolator, polished aluminium with glass bulb in top. Deluxe
     model only. Glass bulb counts as extra window, i.e. all 23 window
     Deluxes with percolator are authorized as 24 windows, etc.


     Breadloafs:

     C30. Breadman coffee maker/bread machine.   Makes 8 cups of
     coffee or 1.5lb loaf of bread. Self-contained unit utilizes
     waste engine heat. Owners may wish to purchase M119 gas
     heater, so they will have some heat to waste.


     Vanagons:

     C40. Air-cooled models only. Restyled C30, looks like
     VW Golf. Bread feature deleted.

     C41. Diesel engine models only. Mr. Bus Coffee Maker with auxiliary
     oil burner. Makes 7800 cups of coffee per pint of diesel fuel.
     Includes safety feature which prevents coffee maker from exceeding 55
     degrees centigrade. Time to heat one cup of coffee to 55 degrees
     centigrade is 40 seconds.


     C42. Standard coffee maker for all wasserboxers. Add ground
     coffee to coolant overflow tank. Start engine. Place coffee cups
     below cylinder heads. Enjoy! Not for use while driving. Owners who
     wish to enjoy making coffee while driving should order C43, however,
     it is not possible to delete C42.

     C43. Optional self-contained coffee maker, single burner
     propane stove, with Melitta goldscreen reusable filter.

     C44. Same as C43, with gimbal mounting to allow operation at angles
     of up to 30 degrees from vertical. Available only for Syncro models.


     EVs

     C50. Starbuck's Espresso/Latte machine. (Requires optional
      2.5KW generator.) Insert beans. Add water. Place cup under spigot.
     Insert $2.25.

     C51. Starbuck's Espresso/Latte machine as above, with &quot;Made in Iowa&quot;
     decal. Available only on EV Campers.


     Those of you doing complete restorations may want to go to a flea market to
     acquire the required parts. Vehicles driving with the incorrect era
     coffee pot will be cited!

     Happy Friday! (a little early, but we are likely to close for
     yet another snow day tomorrow...)
