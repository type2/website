Subject: VWoA warranty - any recent experience?

All this warranty talk has come at an interesting time for me,
although it's not related to the Vanagon situation(s).

My 93 EV is coming up on the 2 year expiration of the date it
was &quot;put into service&quot; (as VW says).  I have until the end of October 
to get all my nit-picky things taken care of - or so I thought.  I
suddenly remembered that the warranty is 2 years or 24K miles, whichever
comes first, and I've just hit 26.2K.  What a sickening feeling.  Besides 
being mad at myself for spacing on the miles, I'm not too happy with the
2 dealers I've called 'cause they're not cutting me much slack.  They're
both giving me the same line : &quot;bring it in, we'll look at what needs work, 
then see what percentage VW will pay.  And by the way, don't put any more
miles on it, or the percentage VW *might* pay will go down.&quot;

Anybody been through something like this?  Is there a &quot;percentage they'll
pay formula&quot; anyone knows the details of?  They're being very vague.

BTW, among the items I want fixed are a noisy speedo head and a power window
problem - both costly items.

Thanks,

rob
