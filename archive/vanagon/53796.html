Subject: FW: cruise control install progress and


Happy Monday!

We made a nice clean install of the Equus cruise control system.  Everything 
worked properly on the first start up last night......

BUT....the vacuum system doesn't suck enough to pull the servo cable and 
work against the throttle springs.  When I turn the system on and set it at 
speed (my friend was in back looking at everything with the engine cover 
off) the cruise control throttle cable draws taught, but can't pull the 
throttle.  With the system on, the van decellerates slower than with it off 
(my foot is off the gas), but does not keep it at speed.  We even made a 1&quot; 
extension for more mechanical advantage, but no dice.

The Bentley diagram of the stock cruise control system shows that it runs 
off a vacuum system that is independant of the engine vacuum.  It has its 
own vacuum pump.  If I could get ahold of one of those pumps.......

Any thoughts or suggestions?  I plan to check my vacuum system see if it is 
working near spec.  What about loosening the throttle springs?

please respond to me directly as I am not recieving daily list 
correspondance.
