Subject: Re: R&amp;T Digression, airbags


	Autoweek recently ran a letter from a chappie who got
t-boned in a MBZ 190- the Idiot Who Hit Him (DUI) was estimated to be
going 70 mph at the time of collision- MBZ was moved 100+ feet
LATTERALLY by the impact. MBZ driver lived, and attributed this
to his airbag, which deployed because of the violence of
the impact 'fooling' the sensors into thinking the car had
been hit from the front. MBZ driver said that the emergency crews
who arrived took it as a matter of course that he would be dead,
and were very surprised that he was not. Conclusion: the airbag
converted this otherwise fatal accident to a property-only affair.

	I've got no gripe against airbags- well, they'll kill
the after-market steering wheels, but such is the price of
progress. Point is, you wear the same 3 point belt that I
ALWAYS wear, with the airbag, and you can survive even
WORSE accidents than with belt alone. Including accidents
you are not responsible for.

	I'm told you can read Lee Iacoca's words to Richard
Nixon in the complete transcript of the Nixon/Watergate tapes,
as Iacoca trys to get Chrysler out of manditory airbags. 

	Anticipating demand, someone (Burlington?, Dow?) wove a lot
of airbag cloth in the 70s, that they were then stuck with when
the manditory bags legistation was cancelled. A 23 mile ribbon of it.
60 feet high, was errected i Sonoma county, as Cristo's Running Fence 
(or running joke...) in 1976. It went all the way out to the Pacific, and
was pretty cool. Or was it the evening I'd spent the night before
that made everything seem so rosy? :-)

	R&amp;T, and anyone else rational, thinks the 'mouse' passive
belts are apalling. They are the one imperfection in my Corrado.
It keeps it from offending the gods, but did they have to go so far???
