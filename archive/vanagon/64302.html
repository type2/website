Mark,:

You may have melted the contacts in the ignition switch.  I had odd
electrical problems that were caused by the switch.  I fixed mine, but a
new one is only $6 from the dealer.  If you take it apart be ready for
ALOT of small parts and springs.  It's one of those things you have to
fix if you take it apart.
Good luck.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 87GL died today while driving under full electrical load: All lights,
&gt; radio and A/C full cold. Would not start immediately, but later would
&gt; and drove it home. Now foll items apparently out: A/C: headlights
&gt; (dashlights work)/.
&gt; Batt shows 12.48V when van off:
&gt; Batt shows 13.28V when van on.
&gt; Stereo and driving lights work, where to start.
