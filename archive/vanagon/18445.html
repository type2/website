All of you all have been so helpful
in the past with bus problems, I was 
wondering if you could help with something else.

I need a printer driver for wordperfect 5.1, for dos,
the printer is an old 9 pin prowriter 8510, citoh 8510.

If any one knows of a wordperfect sight, or a person
that may have this please let me know.

If this posting has upset anyone, Please forgive me.

Matt
