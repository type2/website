Subject: Tie Rod Problem on '81 Westy

The right-side tie rod on my '81 Westy came completely loose from the wheel
side!  Luckily, I was making a slow right turn into my driveway at the
time. I've never heard of this happening and wonder if anyone out there has
had a similar experience or any idea re: the cause. It seems to have
unscrewed itself, but it seems that I would have notices some serious
steering problem well before it finally came completely loose. I
re-attached it for now, and need to take it in for alignment. Any
interesting comments or advice?
