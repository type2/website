&gt;lithium.  However lithium is available in spray and I must admit even I
&gt;use it on hard to reach hinges and such, and the moly stuff is real
&gt;messy and doesn't clean up that well but is largely impervious to water
&gt;on the positive side.

If I remember correctly, you can also get moly in a spray - as in motocycle 
chain lubricant.
