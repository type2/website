To All U.K list members:

 Anybody going to this years VolksWorld show at Sandown park
at the weekend!!!!

This could very well be the first show my van will attend since
being restored. Thats if i can get the starter motor sorted!

I'd like to say hello to any list members that are going face to face.

Cheers,
