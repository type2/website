Subject: Re: Warming Engine OIL


&gt; FWIW, In my 79 bus, all I use is Valvoline 10W30.
&gt; It spit 20W50 out when I tried it last oil change.
What do you mean 'spit out'?
 
&gt; I've been driving it around lately, with weather easily in the 90's, and
&gt; it still runs good and cool.
Do you have an oil pressure gauge? The main problem I've seen with 
10w30 on all my VWs is low(er) oil pressure, not overheating. Does 
anyone know if the type4 AFC engines use the same oil pump as a w/b 
engine? From some comments on early bus oil pressures, it seems that 
the a/c engines get better oil pressure. If the pumps are different, 
is it possible to exchange them?
