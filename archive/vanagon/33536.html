Subject: Re: Value of 66 Kombi as scrap

In a message dated 96-01-23 17:54:00 EST, you write:

&gt;
&gt;Total value of bus, minus transaxel, filled with old (un-useable)
&gt;engine cases, pistons &amp; cylinders, mufflers, twisted bumpers, and 
&gt;any other piece of metal I could find:
&gt;
&gt;$41.50

Seems a bit low.  Since the last Magnesium tree in California was cut down
some years ago, members of the CCC have been willing to pay almost any amount
for old engine cases, trannys and generator stands.  It seems that going
blind from the glare of burning magnesium while inhaling the toxic white
smoke is a fireside ritual of the Vanagon coven of the Calif. Camping Crazies
 The traditional Virgin Sacrifice has been discontinued, however, since
California state law sez the virgin must be at least eighteen.
 Unfortunately, in the Golden State eighteen year old virgins are even rarer
than Magnesium trees.
