Hi Joe,

I use baking soda to clean the inside of the water tank in my 88.  I don't know
if the earlier Westies have an access to the tank.  Assuming you do,  if it's
really grungy inside you could use a small amount of bleach diluted in water to
scrub it out. Make sure you rinse it out *very* well before you fill the tank
for drinking.

Maybe I'm over cautious but I'd throw in a few bottles/cans of water remover in
case you get a tank full of funky gas.  Sometimes some octane booster helps
reduce pinging if the gas you get is really cheesy.  Extra fanbelt(s), fuel
pump, fuel filter, coil, heck anything you have could really come in handy.  If you
have a spare, take it.  An extra gas can is nice to increase your off-road
cruising range.

I went on a 10 trip to Punta San Carlos to surf/windsurf last spring.  We froze
most our food and used dry ice to keep everything frozen.  With duct tape to seal
the top of the coolers and keeping them out of the sun, we had ice cream after 6
days in the middle of the desert!  The caravan I went along with consisted of
mostly Toyota 4x4's.  They all wined on the way down that I couldn't keep up
with them cruising at 75+mph on the freeway and blasting around off-road.  Boy
that sure changed when it was time to eat, sleep, cook or relax.  I think I
counted 10 people in/on my Westie one afternoon, cowering from the sun.  Wish I
had a nickel for everytime I heard someone say 'man, I'd buy one of these things
if it had a bigger motor and some serious 4 wheel running gear on it'.

Have a blast-hope you get some good waves!
