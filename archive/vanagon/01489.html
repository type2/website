Subject: Re: Any Microbus GIF's?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hey, all.
&gt;&gt;I was wondering if anyone had any nice GIF's of '67 and earlier buses.
&gt;&gt;If you do, could you please post them, or e-mail them to me at
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Me too, please!  .bmp' are OK, too...
&gt;

There' a nice GIF of a split-screen ambulance (with a fire-wagen in the
background) on ftp.uhb.fr . It's in images/vwgif.dir/ambul.gif
