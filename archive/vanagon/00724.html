Subject:      Re: Westfalia Clubs ??

&gt;I am the proud owner of a 1977 VW Camper, and in search of a group of people
&gt;who share my interest in these VW's. Anyone know of a  club, in the central
&gt;NJ area with special interests in the Camper. Any info will be helpful. I am
&gt;looking for phone #'s and/or adresses for any such club(s).

the only one i know of specifically for vw campers is
Westfalia Wanderers
13 W. Montgomery St.
Ilion, NY 13357            (ilion? llion?)
