Subject: Cruising Speed

There have been a couple questions about optimal cruising speeds.  One
today said 65 mph for an 81 air cooled van.  Another Westy owner once
suggested 55 as optimal (for water cooled late 80's models).  I happened to
meet this guy while I was on a trip.  He claimed to have been a VW
mechanic.  My gas mileage soared!  But otherwise, at what point are you
being too hard on the van?  Under some circumstances 55 would be TOO slow
(in terms of traffic and conditions).

Any thoughts out there?  I, too, tend to try to drive my van gently.
