Hello VW people.
Just finished the front cv joints on the syncro, what fun. When I HAVE to
use the 1/2&quot; drive on the beast something's not right. Just put the second
water pump in, (6 years on this one). The beast runs, I'm done and can go to
bed.
Going north tomorrow, taking the dodge van cause there is more room, it's
sad when the family gets too big for a vw bus!
I'm going to get off the list while I'm gone, I'd never catch up. 
Have a good summer and keep'em rolling.
Rob
