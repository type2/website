&gt;Does this qualify Thom for martyrdom?

I don't think martyrdom is quite called for someone who's coming back. We
could all get together and have a going away party. How about at &quot;Tom by the
Arch&quot;? Or we could hire Jerry Lewis and have a Tomathon. At least the French
frogs would love it. Ooh La La. In the meantime I'll watch for the second
coming of Tom and save the wise sayings in a file called... tomsays.txt
