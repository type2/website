&gt;possiblity of a Syncro Eurovan for 96. While I doubt that I'll be in the

i have seen (in print) mention of syncro T4 vans as well ... especially the
pickups, but have seen no pictures yet. i've also seen a picture of what was
labeled as a VR6 powered eurovan ... it had a slightly different hood on it.
but so far, nothing has been said about it coming over to the u.s. most
likely it won't. DOT again. :(
