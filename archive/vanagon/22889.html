Subject: And Another Belated Intro

Hello, I'm Sean Roberts of London, OH.  I have a Pea Green '78 Westfalia and
enjoy every minute of it when it isn't costing me money.;)  It has very
little rust and runs good with all original componets and 110,000 miles.
The intereior has just the sink and ice box but is in excelent condition
except I'm missing a few parts (tables, fire ext., waste container/storage
box, and some cabinet handles).  I try to make it to as many VW events as I
can and plan on being at BBTA.
       Hope to see you there!
