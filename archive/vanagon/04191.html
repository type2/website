    WOW!!!!  The return of the word Floccinaucinihilipilification.  
    When I was in grade five, oh..... 19 years ago, we used to have to 
    write the word out as punishment.  The teacher would say, &quot;20 
    floccies&quot; or whatever amount he felt right.
    
    In a way it was better than detention, because you could leave as 
    soon as you finished however many you had to write.  I used to 
    have some pre-written sheets of the word hidden in my desk.  
    That's right, I didn't have anything better to do in my spare 
    time.
