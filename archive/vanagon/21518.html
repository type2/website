Subject: Single-port manifolds for dual Kadrons wanted


I have a '70 single-port engine in a '71 bus (long story), and also have a
pair of dual baby Kadron carburetors lying around. The Kadrons have the
usual dual-port manifolds, but those won't fit my engine!

Anyone have a pair of the old single-port manifolds for these carbs
that they wouldn't mind parting with?  $$$!

TIA,
