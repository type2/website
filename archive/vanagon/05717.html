Subject: gimmie some opinions

Ok here is the situation, I found a guy witha 79 camper.  He wants $3200 
for it.  Here is a general description of it.

79 westfalia
beige
59,000 original miles, has service record of every service except the 60,000
milse service because it is not there yet.  Original manuals.  Engine 
looks and runs good except for small oil leaks from around push rod 
tubes.  Needs to have camper top cavas replaced because of holes, does 
not have seals around the camper top.  fridge works great, sink works 
electric works, has california emmissions stuff on it.  Body is in grat 
condition only 2 small rust spots around the windsheild.  
it has been taken to a mechanic and he checked it all over but said that 
the only prob is that it has an oil leak.  A friend of mine who has a 
similar van said that it just needs new push rods and pushrod tubes.

My questions are about how much is this camper worth?  Is having all that 
calif. emmisions stuff on there gonna complicate servicing the engine?  I 
am in Tennessee so all the emmissions stuff is not required here.  

By looking at it, it appears to be in exellent condition execpt for the 
canvas top, rubber seal around the top, and needing the push rod tubes 
and that junk fixed.  I was told that that runs about 100.  I am new to 
the vw scene, but it is like the perfect vehicle for me as I am a diver 
and a camper.  Please give me your opinions about this vehicle.

Thanx,
Rick
