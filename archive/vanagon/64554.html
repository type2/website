Subject:      Re: European Campgrounds

Hi Ric,
in case you know a little german I could purchase some CD ROM for you, which
is issued by the ADAC (german counterpart to AAA) it contains lots of
Campgrounds all over Europe and is split into a northern and southern europe
issue.
Especially in Austria, France, Italy and Spain it is no problem to find a
Campground within a disatance of lets say 50 km.

see:

unfortunatly they do not deliver overseas, but I guess we could handle that.

Bye Tom N.
