Subject: Westy Poptop Seal

I am about to install the seals on both the poptop and the luggage rack
this weekend and was looking for suggestions on the following:

A) an easy way to do it.
B) what kind of sealant/adhesive youse would recommend
C) easiest order to install
D) suggestions for replacement bolts for the luggage rack (mine are bent
beyond usability)

Thanks
-Marlin
