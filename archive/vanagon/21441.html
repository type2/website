I'd avoid the dealer on these parts, since (as you've already noted) they 
would be prohibitively expensive.  If you can't find good used 
replacements at yards I'd try a heating/ventilating outfit.  Tell them 
what you're looking for in the way of diameter/strength/etc.  If all else 
fails you could probably use some flexible metal hose with an external 
fiberglass insulating liner.  I've found some at building supply houses 
for use with my home heating system but it should work fine on the 
heaters as well.

Give Ark Mirvis in NJ a call as well (201-398-6363) and see what he 
recommends, although I think he'll be on the steep side as well.  Some 
high-temp silicone sealant should work on small cracks in the ducts until 
you find some replacement parts.
