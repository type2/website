Regarding the Subaru engines, I've been impressed with what I've seen here
at work.  I work at Penske Auto Center, doing oil changes/tires and such.

Every once in a while I'll get a Subaru to work on.  From what I've seen of
the Legacy and more recently the Impreza Outback and Legacy Outback, 1)
These are very nice cars, this is what I would have if I didn't have a
Volkswagen, a cool old Subaru and 2) The engines are very nice, run like
clocks.  Even had a mid-'80s high-mile Subaru hatchback in for a water
pump, after the job was done the tech fired it up, ran as smooth and quiet
as any car I've ever seen.  Much more so than a Vanagon engine.  Just
ticking right along.

Of course, with the Subaru you lose the rear license plate oil fill/check
station as the Subaru oil fill and dipstick are toward the middle of the
engine, near the intake runners.

And Tim mentions below a very important issue, the oil pan.  Whereas the
Vanagon has a nice flat bottom engine case, oil sump level with bottom of
cylinders, the Subaru has a real oil pan that hangs quite low, with the
vulnerable oil filter hanging down right next to it just as low.  That
would be a real issue for the off roaders, especially.  

As far as the engines themselves, they seem to be well-built and reliable. 
The ones I've dealt with have just needed oil changes, and I haven't seen
any come in for major repairs, except for the one that needed a water pump.


I like working on the Subaru as the oil drain plug and filter are very easy
to get to -- that makes or breaks a car in my mind, working as a lube tech
:-)

&gt; 
&gt; And on it goes.....
&gt; 
&gt; forgot to mention a detail from KEP folks re their autobox Subaru
&gt; vanagon..   seems they have blown out (how?) two ATF/H2O heat
&gt; exchangers, the tin box on the front of the trans. They don't know why.
&gt; Awful mess, when coolant under pressure it goes into the autotrans, when
&gt; cooling off sucks ATF into coolant system. Double flush and bleed.  They
&gt; are not amused ;).
&gt; 
&gt; And furthermore.....
&gt; 
&gt; Checked out a Subaru 2.2L Legacy engine close up.  Modern engine, nice
&gt; massive cast aluminium intake runners, throttle body is highest thing on
&gt; the engine (right under a vanagon deck lid), 1 coil/spark plug, also as
&gt; high as possible.  This should run in water say 4-6&quot; deeper than the
&gt; vanagons wasser!! Good for Syncro Schwimmers. Very 'tight' compact
&gt; engine, no surplus water/FI piping etc. Vanagon wasser really looks old
&gt; tech!!
&gt; 
&gt; Sizes:  width 28&quot;, length 17&quot;, height above the centreline of the crank
&gt; 13&quot;, height below centreline 11&quot; These are approximate to say 1/2&quot;. So
&gt; what... ?
&gt; 
&gt; well....  it won't fit under a 2WD vanagon deck lid, needs very little
&gt; however, like 1&quot;, and only 4&quot; diam. area over the throttle body inlet. 
&gt; Cutting away padding and forming the decklid with a heat gun would do
&gt; it. SOOL if you have a steel decklid.
&gt; It will fit nicely under a Syncro decklid though :) :)
&gt; 
&gt; Removing the VW airflap housing from existing filter box and replacing
&gt; with plate/collar will allow the VW air intake system to stay in place.
&gt; Need fat 'S' bend hosing to link up filter box to throttle body,
&gt; possibly the Subaru hose will do it!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Width and length are perfect match to fit in, Better fit since the
&gt; plumbing/FI crap doesn't hang off each side.  Don't know about alt/PS/AC
&gt; since all was off the engine. They mount high, one serpentine belt
&gt; pulley only. Also good for water protection.
&gt; 
&gt; And now the bad news.....  The vanagon oil 'pan' is only about 7&quot; below
&gt; the crank centre, Subaru has another 4&quot; to go, all oil pan!  This is
&gt; definately not Syncro compatible, and not my idea for any 2WD either. 
&gt; Ground clearance drops to say 4-5&quot; unloaded, 2-3&quot; maxed out.  Dangerous,
&gt; at least a gravel plate is needed, preferably a solid skid plate, and
&gt; not the existing Syncro one. Wah-hah!
&gt; 
&gt; Finally....  If anyone has seen KEPs conversion close up and checked
&gt; this out can you mail me your impressions.  The KEP mobile has been road
&gt; tested by one listee last year (it books!), can I get some more
&gt; firsthand info from someone.  
&gt; 	And if anyone is within local phone distance can you call KEP and
&gt; discuss this problem with them? My bills are getting up there.  They
&gt; have never mentioned it to me, despite being well versed in other
&gt; idioSyncrosies of the conversion.  Best of all, can someone go photo
&gt; KEPs setup carefully, or suggest to them that they get it done
&gt; professionally, and get the photos scanned and up on a webpage. It's
&gt; long overdue.
&gt; 
&gt; 	If anyone knows what it takes to dry sump an engine please mail me that
&gt; info too.  I need help, this is becoming a PITA.  Definately looks like
&gt; the right engine for a vanagon, despite all this, I waaaannt it!
&gt; 
&gt; bye folks/thanks, Tim
