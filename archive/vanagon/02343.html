Subject: Re: More trip talk

i dont think anyone is going to be interested in paying for gas - let me see
*just number crunching* 8000miles/20mpg= 400 gallons gas/diesel per
loaf/brick. If 30 bricks/loafsgo the distance then thats about $15K. 
I think that kind of money (which my guess is will be dear) would be better
spent on emergency planning. Logistical nightmare too.
