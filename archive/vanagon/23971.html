Brian Verbeek from the list as well as the Netherlands was kind enough
to go to his local VW dealer and get me an assortment of T4 brochures.
My collection now includes catalogues from the US, Germany, Norway and
the Netherlands.

Anyway, the Norwegian and Dutch TRANSPORTER catalogues list a
Double Cab VAN (as well as pick up)! The van has a &quot;wall&quot;
behind the middle seat. This wall also blocks out part of
the area behind the rear seat where passengers would step
to go to the third seat, effectively sealing off a separate
compartment in the rear, accessable through the rear hatch
only. This version is available in both the short and long
wheelbase bodies.

The Kombi is alive and well in the T4. As with the Kombi
of old the Kombi has plain rubber mats, and plain pressboard
type of interior wall and roof trim. There are a number of
Kombi versions...twin rear door...7,8,9 and 10 passenger
versions...low roof...high roof...etc...etc..

There is even a section in the Dutch catalogue showing what
one can do with a cab and bare framed T4 ... recycling
truck...box van...and even a pastry store on wheels!!
