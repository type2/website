Dear Mark &amp; Kath,
Just in case no one else has already done so (and it doesn't appear that 
they have), let me be the first to say, Welcome!

&gt; Hi!
&gt; I'm Kathy Myers.
&gt; Steve Johnson suggested I subscribe to this list. Thanks, Steve!
&gt; I have a newly &quot;resto-customized&quot; '68 midnight pearl purple and 
&gt; midnight pearl turquoise bus (ultra shiny -  full blown urathane race 
&gt; car paint with 7 coats of clear) and my signifcant other has an emerald 
&gt; green '69 squareback.  (very clean body - but - painted with totally 
&gt; flat - Tru-Value Hardware forest green - spary cans! :-) )  
&gt; 
&gt; Does it go without saying, that we have a difference of opinion when it 
&gt; comes to spending big bucks on restorations? :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I have previously owned a '65 split window - customized camper - with a 
&gt; super 1600 Porsche engine, and a '70 Kombi - with completely customized 
&gt; interior. Mark Blanchard, my SO, has previously owned a '67 bug with a 
&gt; sun roof, and a '67 square back.
&gt; 
&gt; We love our VWs because we can work on them.   (Mark's the mechanic, 
&gt; and I'm  the helper.) 
&gt; 
&gt; We are TOTALLY into gas heaters and studded snows on all four. (During 
&gt; the winter.) And I'm proud to announce, that  ever since I finished the 
&gt; bus, I can easily say - we are both into beautiful old buses... just as 
&gt; long as they don't cost Mark anything but his time!
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for inviting me to share your group.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
