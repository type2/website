&gt; I posted a few weeks ago about my brakes, recieved some tips, followed 
&gt; some advice, and they're still dragging! :-( I've replaced the master 
&gt; cylinder and both rear wheel cylinders with new brazillian parts and my 
&gt; rear brakes still drag. If I adjust the shoes (via the adjusting stars) 
&gt; away from the drums, they work fine for a few miles and then start 
&gt; dragging again. The return springs appear fine, although I have not 
&gt; replaced them (this would require endless scrounging through a junkyard). 
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas? 

	Jonny,
	Maybe this is a dumb question, but if you can always make them
STOP dragging by turning the adjusting stars, then maybe the adjusting
stars are turning my themselves???? Anyway, I second whoever suggeested
checking the parking brake linkage too.

	A sunny-day thing to try would be wait for the dragging
to start, then, if the adjusting star doesn't actually fix it time
after time (eg and is bad itself), pull the brake drum AFTER THE
SHOES START DRAGGING and see what's actually holding them out: 

	Bill
