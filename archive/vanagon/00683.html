Subject: weekend report and shifting prob.

Well, I'm back from my trip to Chicago -- first decent length trip in my 
84 Vanagon.  It was REALLY nice.  My wife played stewardess and served us 
(mew and the kids and our exchange student) lunch which made the trip 
about an hour shorter for not having to stop.  I got about 26 mpg on the 
way down and about 24 mpg on the way back, so I'm pretty happy with that 
part of it.  During the trip, however, my shifter started behaving worse, 
so now it's become hard enough that I really have to fix it.  It goes 
smoothly into first, but hard into second.  It goes easily into third, 
but is REALLY hard to get back out again.  Any hints are welcome.  I've 
read the manual, and it looks like any adjustments are pretty tricky, but 
I'm betting something's worn anyway and adjusting won't help.

Wow does that sound familiar!  If you find the solution to your shifting 
problems, pass 'em on.

The other good news is that the list seems to have run very well while I've
been gone.  (except for mail to Thom Fitzpatrick).

Til tomorrow ...
