Subject: re: Water in headlights


&gt;Has anyone ever tried placing the headlights in the oven (at low temp) to
&gt;bake out the moisture?

When there has been water in one of the headlights, there usually is a samll
crack or hole resulting from a rock chip.  Not sure if getting water out will
help unless you can seal the leak too.
