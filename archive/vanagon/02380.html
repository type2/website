Subject: Hard start rainy weather -


Well I finally got the KG Cabrio out of storage and got it running (after 
two years). 
Everything had been soaked in oil so all the electricals had to 
be thouroughly cleaned before it would start. I had forgotten how &quot;noisy&quot; 
it was. Hydraulic lifters and 15 feet of space betwen you and the 
engine make a big difference!

Now of course the Westfalia won't start...anybody experience hard starting 
in damp rainy weather? Are Vanagon's susceptible to this problem? If so 
what is the best way to prevent it. ( I'm assuming this is the problem....).
