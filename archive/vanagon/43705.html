Hi,

maybe someone here can help. I ordered KYB gas-shocks from my FLAPS, but
was surprised when the guy said that all 4 are the same (and all prices at
$31.95 each). Jack S. agrees that the rear ones should be beefier. Would
anyone (who's been there before) know the correct reference numbers for
both kinds? TIA!

Sami

PS: Please cc or reply to dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu, since I'm no longer
on the list. Thanks.
