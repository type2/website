Subject: Wally's Bra

Well Wally, the '84 Westy is a he and has no usse for a bra. Anyway not the
bra I bought for him in Charlotte NC 7 years ago before the fateful night
the hose blew and I cooked Wally's first engine. Since our interstate days
are over, I am offering the like new black bra I bought at the dealer there
for $50 plus $5 shipping.
