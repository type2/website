Subject: Re:  Ball Joint Removal Tool

I use the pickle fork - what you do is stretch the rubber the opposite
way before you slide it in, then when you bang on it you are just
compressing it, and not stretching it sideways which tears it.

I have had ball joints which the 'puller' wont get apart, only the 
pickel fork did the trick.
