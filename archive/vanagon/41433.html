Yup, another spot for you to admire.  Take out the glove box and air duct 
above it to get a look at the inside edge of the windshield sill.  Mine is 
badly pitted/bubbled in the corner area.  I put this down to a bad 
windshield gasket allowing seepage in.  The outside of the body in the same 
area is in perfect shape, no rust blems anywhere, and seal is 'tight'.  
Looks like our salt-slush winters up here take an unseen toll.  Slush sits 
on the rubber all winter, must seep in by capillary action.  Good place to 
rust spray no matter where you live. You can admire the complete lack of 
insulation behind the dash while you're there too :( Tim
