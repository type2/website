    Subject: VIRUS WARNING (fwd)

    TC/Assist received a Fax from Kenneth Nicholson, Technical Services,
    Moncton

    N.B regarding an Internet Virus called &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot;.  Here is what the Fax
    stated:

    This message originated in Tucson.
    If you receive a mail message with a subject of &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot;, do the
    following:

    1 - DO NOT READ THE MESSAGE
           **************************************
    2 - Write down the name/Email address of the person who sent you the
    message and contact TC/Assist as soon as possible.
    3 - DELETE THE MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY !!!!!!!
           ********************************************************
    The virus originated from America Online and is propagated through the
    Internet. The FCC recently released a warning concerning a matter of major
    importance to any regular user of the Internet.  Apparently, a new computer
    virus has been engineered by a user of America Online that is unparalleled
    in its destructive capability.  Other more well known viruses such as
    Stoned, Airwolf, and Michaelangelo pale in comparison to the prospects of
    the newest creation by a warped mentality. What makes this virus so
    terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact that no program needs to be exchanged
    for a new computer to be infected.  It can be spread through the existing
    Email systems of the Internet.  Once a computer is infected, one of several
    things can happen.  If the computer contains a hard drive, it will most
    likely be destroyed.  If the program is not stopped, the computer's
    processor will be placed in an Nth-complexity infinite binary loop, which
    can severely damage the processor if left running that way for to long.
    Unfortunately, most novice computer users will not realize what is
    happening until it is to late! Luckily, there is one sure means of
    detecting what is now known as the &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot; virus.  It always travels
    to new computers the same way - in a text Email message with the subject
    line reading simply &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot;. Avoiding infection is easy once the file
    has been received by - NOT READING IT!  The act of loading the file into
    the mail server's ASCII buffer causes the &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot; mainline program to
    initialize and execute.  The program is highly intelligent - it will send
    copies of itself to everyone whose Email address is contained in a
    received-mail file, if it can find one.  It will then proceed to trash the
    computer it is running on.

    The bottom line here is - if you receive a file with the subject line
    &quot;GOOD TIMES&quot;, delete it.
