Subject: Friday Fart Joke

An old VW owner came into his doctor's office and confessed to an
embarrassing problem. &quot;I fart all the time, Doctor Johnson, but they're
soundless, and they have no odor. In fact, since I've been here, I've
farted no less than twenty times. What can I do?&quot;

&quot;Here's a prescription, Mr. Harris. Take these pills three times a day for
seven days and come back and see me in a week.&quot;

Next week an upset Mr. Harris marched into Dr. Johnson's office. &quot;Doctor, I
don't know what was in those pills, but the problem is worse! I'm farting
just as much, but now they smell terrible! What do you have to say for
yourself?&quot;

&quot;Calm down, Mr. Harris,&quot; said the doctor soothingly. &quot;Now that we've fixed
your sinuses, we'll work on your hearing!!!&quot;

At least with e-mail, you don't have disgruntled servers killing each other.
