YEP!  I had taken both plastic rear a/c side panels off an '86 once and left
them off, only to find the next morning that the whole evaporator overhead
panel had come crashing down, cracking the center duct that goes out and up
to front of the van, and cracked the evap plastic housing...

Believe it or not - those 2 rear side panels are the only thing holding the
evap. assembly and housing to the cieling....

brace it up there w/ a piece of wood..
