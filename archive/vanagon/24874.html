I did have a little bit of a hard time getting mine off, but eventually did
come off with levering and gentle hammering.  If yours are REALLY stuck, you
might see waht they cost to replace (and if they're in stock) and then
consider whacking them a little harder.  And, about that speedometer cable -
REMOVE THAT CIRCLIP BEFORE YOU TRY TO REMOVE THE CAP.  Otherwise you'll pull
your speedometer cable out with the cap!
