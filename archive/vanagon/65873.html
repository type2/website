Subject:      web page updates

Hey all,
Updated a little tonight.  Added a procedure for replacing the heater
cables in the air-cooled Vanagon, direct route:

I also made the tech page a little less cumbersome, still got some work
to do on it tho but it is looking better.

The tech page has been doing pretty well as far as traffic, so keep that
counter rolling :-)
