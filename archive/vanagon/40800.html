&gt;This is similar to why golf balls are dimpled.  If hit the same, a smooth
&gt;golf ball will not travel as far as a dimpled golf ball.   If this worked,
&gt;the drag would be reduced (somewhat) and mpg increased.

sooo .... we should all go out and &quot;dimple&quot; our buses with a ball peen
hammer???

there once was some folks up in the PNW, named IPD, that had some stick-on
vortext generators that supposedly worked pretty good. but sales were
lousy so they quick selling them. a set for a station wagon (or bus) was
about $50.
