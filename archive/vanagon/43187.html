I wanted a outer front wheel bearing for the 67 camper, so i went to the
local Schmucks, rather than 15 miles to the closest VW shop.    
He asks the computer,  finally found it onthe shelf.   i took it out of the
box and compared it to the one i brought in.  &quot;This one is Too Big,&quot;  i said

so he checker the computer and the shelf, and found another one, which i
again checked
&quot;This one is Too Small.&quot;

back to the computer, and digging on the racks, he produced another box,

&quot;Ahh,  this one is Just Right.&quot;

no one laughed)
