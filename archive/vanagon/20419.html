It takes a long time.

&gt; 
&gt; Does it go bad faster once you open the container?

Yes, the shelf life  of a sealed PB container is several years,
but I'll bet it drops way off once opened

&gt; 
&gt; Should I eat the peanut butter or throw it out?

Open it up and see if it looks weird.  If it looks fine, see if 
it smells weird.  If it smells fine, try just a little bit.
Rotten peanuts can produce a deadly toxin, but it should be obvious
if they've gone off.
