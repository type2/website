Subject: I'm Back!....and.....

It's been two weeks without you guys and now that I've re-subcribed I feel so
_even_ again!! I noticed I was beginning to drink more coffee, I wasn't
sleeping right, I was snapping at my kitties; even Ramona seemed to sense
something was amiss.
And so.......
Question numero uno: Ramona will have herself a set of used heater boxes
installed next week up at VW Bus Heaven and I was wondering, since she's
never had working heat since we met, just how do those funky levers work
anyways?? There are two sets of two; one blue and one red. Is 'UP' open and
'DOWN' closed?? I can't figger it out.
Question numero dos:This one's fer Pa out in California who is the proud
Daddy of an '84 Westfalia Wolfsberg name of Ramon. &lt;aww!&gt;
Recently, he heard a very loud clackety-clack and brought him in to be looked
at. They explained the problem was his CV joint and that replacing it would
cost approx. $1,058 (this quote included some minor rear brake work.) He had
them do the job. Pa called me the other day from Eagle Lake where he is
camping to tell me he is hearing the same exact noise again. I told him to
bring it back to the same garage P-Ronto, and make 'em refix him. First: was
that a 
fair price for the job they did?? Second: Are the chances high that the
problem recurred due to the mechanic's error or could it be another CV joint
going? Are there two?? What's the CV joint do?
Pappa thanks you!!
Question numero tres (is this fun or what?!):I'll be leaving for my road trip
at the end of this month. I am travelling with one other person who is also a
woman. Because it's a '71 Bus with rainbow curtains, should I fret the Law??
I'm legal and 'Mona's legal, but I have this itchy problem with being asked
to step out of the car. Have any of you run into raod trip problemos that
concern local authorities?? Do you kiss ass??? Do you let them search your
van?? Do ya try fer the border?
Question numero cuatro: Did we ever decide which gas is best for our babies?
I've been putting in regular as opposed to Super. Is that good? What about
additives? Which ones??

Okay class, time's up, pencils down, let's see some RE's!!!!
Thank ya-Rach &amp; Ramona
