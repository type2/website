I have a 71 camper with the 1.6 liter type 1 engine.  I have my eye on
a 73 WESTY with no engine. 
 The cross brace is not even there. 
Someone removed the engine and didn't keep it with the Westy.  The 73
body is cream-puff and I would like to drop my engine or a like
replacement into the 73.  Yes, less power, slower, but at my age, this
makes no difference to me.

weel,  1600s were an option in 72-79 buses inEurope.   The motor bolts right
up to the later tranny.  The problem is the cross brace and tin.  I found a
bus in a junkyard with the Euro kit and pulled it couse one day I might find
a nice later bus with blown motor cheap.  The cross brace looks like a type
three.   The tin you'll need to create so the engine compartement is sealed.
  Anyone remember the email address of the guy in the Netherlands who pulled
a 1600 out of a 78 to put it in his 71.  maybe he has the parts this
transplant needs.
