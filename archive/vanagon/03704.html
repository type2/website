I'm still undecided if I'm going to Lawrence or Manassas, Manassas is
about 2 hours shorter

&gt; Anyone out there in net land going to the VW show in Lawerence, MA
&gt; this weekend? Its exit 42W off I-495 at the Lawrence Stadium.
&gt; 
&gt; Its a good show and swap meet.
&gt; 
&gt; e-mail me if you are going.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll probably take the '56 and maybe the EuroVan.
