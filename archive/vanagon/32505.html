Subject: '80 tips

&gt;2)  Tires, tires, tires....I see the one size the manual calls for
&gt;and I've read some chatter about other sizes some of you folks have
&gt;been using but I must have missed specifics of size somewhere.
&gt;What's best for handling, mileage and performance???

You can go 'round and 'round regarding tread patterns but make sure you get
a tire with reinforced sidewalls. These are typically 'light truck' or 'RV'
tires
(although you won't find many RV's with 14-inch rims).
In the states at least these are also designated as Load Range 'C' or 'D'.
I found some nice Dunlop 'D' commercial truck tires which improved handling
by 100%.

&gt;3)  It would appear that I don't have a blower for the
&gt;heater/defroster setup...is there such a beast and what is involved
&gt;in installing one?  (My brother-in-law has one on his '78 and had one
&gt;on his '73 so I want one too...bigger!!)

I thought that they either had the auxiliary heater or the blower. Do you
have the green knob down on the right below the steering wheel? If so, you
have a aux heater. Consider yourself fortunate.

&gt;4)  Fridge doesn't work on either propane, 12VDC or 110VAC.

Sounds like something fundamental is wrong, like the ammonia leaked out or
something. Take it to an RV shop and they can look at it.
Bentley shows how to remove the later models, don't know if it applies to
the '80 though. Don't forget that the vent is bolted on from the
outside.

&gt;5)  I want to put in an auxiliary battery...should it be wired
&gt;through an isolator, selector switch or neither?

The recommended practice with this is to use a relay (aka X-switch) that is
triggered when the alternator is charging. Easiest is to splice into the
wire feeding the ALT light on the dash. Then run the biggest wires you can
find the shortest distance possible to this relay and to your aux battery.
And finally, make sure you've got a deep-cycle or else don't run your
fridge from it when your engine isn't running.

have fun,
