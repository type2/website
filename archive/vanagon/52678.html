With all this discussion about &quot;cab forward&quot; and how Chrysler is using 
&quot;revisionist history&quot; to portray its &quot;inventions&quot;....one must remember that 
the original &quot;cab forward&quot; design (as Chrysler puts it...moving the front 
wheels forward and the rear wheels further back) did not originate with the 
Vanagon either....but with the tried and true Morris/Austin Mini back in 
1959!
