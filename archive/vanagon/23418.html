Subject: 74 VW van stuff

Hi all,

I'm looking for a good place to get parts for my van where I won't 
spend an arm and a leg. I live in the Seattle area but I would not mind 
going out of state for parts at a good price. If anybody has a favorite 
place that they get parts from please let me know. If I get enough 
responses I will compile the list and pass it on

Have a great day,

=Joe=
