Subject: Terryville, CT Show Report

Hi folks,

I made it to the Terryville, CT VW show this past Sunday.  My wife and I
arrived in our '82 rabbit convertible (left the bus home--didn't have time
to wash it and I knew if I brought it to the show dirty IT would be
embarrassed).   As usual, I spent about 75% of my time getting greasy in the
swap area (bliss!) and the other 25% of the time I chatted with some
familiar and new bus faces.  I basically snubbed the bugs/things/ghias since
Lajiri was getting heat exhausted and we had to get to a cooler area.  

Das Bulli House was there with their sheetmetal offerings all layed out
neatly looking like the skeletal remains of a primer-tive grey bus.  Mary
was busy with customers every time I passed by so I didn't get a chance to
introduce myself.  A regular vendor who sells quality tools was there. He
didn't have the crank gear puller I needed and when we discussed prices he
kindly recommended I just get them from JC Whitney since he couldn't sell
his tools for as cheap.  He did have a neat looking ball joint press that he
wanted $100 for.  It was a long, thick steel cylinder cut away on one side
with a huge harded bolt that threaded in the top of the cylinder.  It came
with a box of fittings to accomodate various joints.  Anyone know if these
work well?

As we were talking tools, our attention was diverted when a guy came over
wearing a rubber bug mask on his head.  I saw this guy at the Litchfield
show.  Both days were very hot and he managed to have this rubber mask of a
VW beetle that covered his whole head on everytime I saw him.  His gag was
to take a few drags off his cigarette and seal the mask around his head and
puff smoke out the rubber exhaust pipe!  We figured his face must look alot
like the rubber beetle by now--only sweatier!

I remembered to drop by the sound booth and say hi to Jim Digennaro--Jim was
the only listmember I saw at the meet.  I moved to another booth where some
good natured folks seemed to be having a good time just hanging out and were
incidentally there to sell off some parts.  Aside from getting greasy in the
swap area, most of the fun of these shows is the fraternal atmosphere--where
else can you get 600+ people together and talk about VWs?! ;).   Of course
there were some &quot;strictly business&quot; booths and rightfully so, I guess, since
for some people it's strictly a business.

VW Bus Heaven was there with their usual offerings.  They were still selling
the NOS 68-74 bus clock for &lt;gasp&gt; $200.  The also had a used tent for $600,
a NOS hand-pump faucet for 68-72 for $50 and used sink drain plugs for $10.
I'd recommend them if you REALLY need some hard to find baywindow
parts--they probably have it.  But be prepared to part with the clothes on
your back and a couple limbs.  If the swap meets of the future look like
this (and I'm sure they will), you can count me out.

The engine blow was extremely anti-climactic.  I think the trusty VW engine
went full throttle for about 30 seconds before it siezed up.  Fortunately
the event didn't distract me from my purchasing--I picked up a new rivet gun
with rivets for $5 and new cowhide welding gloves for $4 from a
Harbor-Freight-like vendor.  I was shocked that among all his wares he
didn't bring any bondo with him.  No bondo for sale at a VW meet???  What if
someone needed an emergency repair?!

We checked out the buses in the show area and I bumped into a few people we
met at the Litchfield show. The guy who sold me the rear end off a '73 at
the last show was selling his '74 westy so he could finance roof repairs on
his house.  It had been a California bus and the few bits of rust I saw were
truly surface rust from scratched paint.  The interior needed going over and
new poptop canvas was in order but he was only asking $2000.  He probably
went home without his bus.

There was a vanagon doublecab at the show with Ontario plates.  It was
dented here and there and new paint had been applied over the dents.  It was
nice to see a rare vanagon even if it wasn't pristine.  I spoke with a guy
who had a '77 camper that he was building a custom interior for.  He built
his own birch-face cabinets on the wall behind the driver's seat, with a
built-in horizontal cooler.  It looked great and very functional.  On his
sliding door he had a map of the U.S. glued to the wood panel and urethaned.
His bus made me want to pull my westy interior and build my own.

After that we left, seeking refuge at an airconditioned Dunkin' Donuts.
GTIs whizzed by and assorted bugs struggled by.  I'll have to save these
memories for when the winter gets cold and ugly and my bus is covered with
roadsalt and ice.
