&gt; Let's try this again.... Has anybody out there removed Power mirrors off a

&gt; I'll explain it better this time.
&gt; the wires that come out of the mirror go thru a hole in the door.
&gt; the hole in the door is not big enough to allow the plastic wire connectors to
&gt; pass thru. Is there any way I can remove the wires from the plastic wire
&gt; connectors (the're sort of in there permanently) or do I have to break the
&gt; plastic wire connector? Is the connector something that you can buy by itself,
&gt; or not?  Bentley is no help.
&gt; 
&gt; As I write this , I'm in the middle of trying to do this, that's why the
&gt; frustration and impatience....  :&lt;(
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be appreciated..
&gt; Joel, didn't you install power mirrors on your van??
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,

Chris,
You should be able to stick a jewlers flat srewdriver into the plastic
plug at each of the terminals to release each wire.  Each connector is
held in by a clip that's part of the connector.  You should be able to
see the clip by looking directly into the plug.
