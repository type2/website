Subject: [S] Re: Blasphemy, tires, and handling.

I propose the next time someone wants to bring up the topic of &quot;My car is 
better than *your* car&quot; that they put [s] /s or something like that in 
the message indicating the stupidity of it.
Please refrain (both sides here).  All cars are money pits, and we are 
banded here to keep VW buses running and not to believe that they are the 
be-all and end-all of cars, but because we want to keep ours running.  
Some of the people on this list might even HATE their VWs.  It doesn't 
matter. Please don't get juvenile about this.

Thanks.
P.S. It's in the archives -- why are we rehashing it?
