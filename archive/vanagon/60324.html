This past weekend I spotted a passenger van which looked similar in design
to a Vanagon. The labelling on it didn't reveal any manufacturer but the
model name was &quot;BESTA&quot;. Looked like it could have been made by Lada or Fiat.

The sighting got the best of my curiosity. Does anyone know who makes this?
---------------------------------------------------------------


Even worse than a Fiat but a little better than a Lada.

What you saw is probably a KIA Besta Van. This is a Toyota licensed Hi-Ace Van 
of the 1980's a little bit remodeled by KIA Motors of Korea.
