&gt; After being in China for just about the entire summer, I returned in mid August to 
&gt; discover the necessity of dealing with renewing all of the license and inspection permits 
&gt; on one of our two &quot;regular&quot; cars, a truck, and my '69 pop topper. Well, as you may have 
&gt; also experienced when confronted with the requirements of obtaining proper permits for 
&gt; those functions that should be rights, it took the better part of two days to deal with 
&gt; all of that franchised permit revenue generating crap.
&gt; 
&gt; So, after being put into a super good mood, all of which was generated by the standing in 
&gt; line after line for hours on end, I return to my happy home and proceed to stick all of my 
&gt; bright new labels on the various windshields, making sure that each label is positioned 
&gt; properly, and just as importantly, affixed to the proper automobile.
&gt; God forbid I should err.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, my wife's car seemed to revolt at the idea of having its old sticker(s) removed from 
&gt; the windshield so I was confronted with the necessity of having to go get a razor blade 
&gt; scraper so as to perform windshield label surgery, but alas and alack, I did not have the 
&gt; necessary tool in my readily available grasp. Not to worry, this will keep until tomorrow, 
&gt; thinks I.
&gt; 
&gt; The next evening my wife returns home from work with a ticket. You guessed it.........
&gt; Not having a current sticker on the windshield.
&gt; 
&gt; Yup, I am a happy camper. Back from the People's Republic and into the bowels of the 
&gt; sticker republic.
&gt; 
&gt; What the hey? I'm an adult. I'm grown up. I can handle adversity. I get over it all.
&gt; 
&gt; Two evenings later, I am on Interstate 10, headed for home about 11:00 at night. Whooosh! 
&gt; There goes a heifer cop past me doing about 75-80 mph. No lights. No siren. Just late for 
&gt; the latest batch of fresh donuts and free coffee at the fast stop market.
&gt; 
&gt; I wheel in behind the heifer cop, and proceed down I-10 at her same rate of speed, 
&gt; obviously not endangering anyone, otherwise &quot;we&quot; wouldn't be clipping along at that rate 
&gt; of speed. I stay several car lengths behind her.
&gt; 
&gt; She changes lanes. I change lanes.
&gt; This occurs several times. Each time, I stay several lengths behind her so as to not be 
&gt; following too close.
&gt; 
&gt; She exits off onto the main street that heads towards my house, and, of course I take the 
&gt; same exit. At the very last minute, at the stop light, she again changes lanes.
&gt; Ditto do I.
&gt; 
&gt; We are now proceeding down my home stretch street, and I give her a quick double click of 
&gt; the brights. She whips into a parking lot and does a slick 180 degree maneuver so as to 
&gt; face my entry into same. Obviously she is a trained precision acrobat driver.
&gt; Cool! I feel better.
&gt; 
&gt; Out of the car comes the heifer cop, with her trusty bull cop sidekick staying put in the 
&gt; car. I roll down my window with a cool touch of my power window button and am about to be 
&gt; of assistance to her, when she, using her officer's voice, asks &quot;Why are you following 
&gt; me?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I reply. &quot;Young lady. I wasn't following you. I was trying to get your attention. Are you 
&gt; aware of the fact that you have no license plate on the rear of your automobile? I am sure 
&gt; that you are aware of the fact that Texas state law requires that you have a license plate 
&gt; on the rear of any automobile that you might drive on public streets.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; She replies. &quot;Let me see your license?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I reply. &quot;Surely. May I also see yours? Obviously I was trying to get your attention for a 
&gt; reason&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; She does the old computer check on my license. 
&gt; I proceed to write down all of the information from hers.
&gt; After a while she returns to my car.
&gt; Again, with a cool touch of my power window button, I lower the glass so as to allow for 
&gt; more pleasantries and interesting civilian to officer chit chat.
&gt; 
&gt; She hands me my license.
&gt; I tell her that I will be done with hers in just a few more minutes, and for her to please 
&gt; be patient.
&gt; 
&gt; I hand her license back to her, and again tell her that she must try to obey the laws of 
&gt; the state of Texas when she drives upon our public streets. She replies with an excuse of 
&gt; the car having been just issued less than 20 days ago to the force.
&gt; I respond by refreshing her memory with the fact that under circumstances such as that, 
&gt; she must then have a 21 day temporary permit in her rear window.
&gt; 
&gt; I tell her that there is no need for further action on my part tonight. The rest of what 
&gt; needs to be done can be handled tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; She proceeds to leave.
&gt; 
&gt; As she hustles off in a huff. I give my parting words of wisdom.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;By the way, young lady, I am not a trained observer, such as yourself, but, simply as a 
&gt; judgment call on my part, nothing more, I believe that you might very well have been 
&gt; driving at a bit too fast for traffic conditions. I hope that you will hold it down in the 
&gt; future.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; She doesn't even thank me for my being so courteous.
&gt; 
&gt; I get even by thinking &quot;Bitch!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; ***************************
&gt; You would have thought she understood that what is good for the goose is good for the b 
&gt; gander, but I guess she still had those donuts on her mind.
