Things to look for and another price point.  The Wolfsburg edition had
a special trim package and other options not available on a standard GL.

&gt; 
&gt; I looked at an '87 Vanagon last night (I'm still a wannabus) and smelled that
&gt; sweet smell when I turned the heat on.  (I think it was mostly from the
&gt; rear heater).  Is this something to be concerned about?
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, it's a 87 GL Wolfsburg with the weekender package, AC, 4spd, 105K mi,
&gt; in excellent condition.  Asking 5500$.
