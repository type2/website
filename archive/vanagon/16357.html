I am in the process of ordering all the bits I need for my new motor. 
Exhaust, dist, etc has been ordered.  Next, I am calling about a 
clutch and related items.  I was also planning on changing the tranny 
fluid and working on the shifting a little.  It all shifts ok but I am 
sure it could feel better.  So, what else should I be doing when I 
have the motor out of there?  Looking at the prices in RMMW I think I 
can afford to replace all rubber shifter parts and such.  What I want 
to know is which of these have to be done with the motor out, coupler,
bushings, springs and the like.  I would rather get it running and do 
this later but would do it now if it meant pulling the motor later.
Also, where can one find a rebuilt generator and regulator for less 
than $120?  I might to switch to the alternator at those prices.  
Finally, this is a '71 bus w/1600DP.  The first three respondents get 
a free ride around my block when this thing runs.  Thanks, Jim
