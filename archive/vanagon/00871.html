[Dyer Lytle writes, in part:]

&gt; I have a question about the sink water pump that is described as a
&gt; &quot;wobble&quot; pump in the camper part of the owner's manual.  The pump I
&gt; have has difficulty &quot;priming&quot;, that is, getting started delivering water.
&gt; I find that when the 7.5 gallon water tank is full it will start pumping
&gt; fairly easily but after a gallon or two is gone I have to blow into the
&gt; top of the water tank, pressurizing it, before I can get it to start
&gt; pumping.  I assume that the pump diaphragm or seal needs to be replaced.
&gt; Anyone have any ideas about this?  Can I fix it myself?
&gt; 

Hi Dyer!

I have the same problem with the pump in my '71 Westy.  I replaced all the
insides of it (got a rebuild kit from a camper supply place), but it still
needs priming after sitting for a couple of days.  I have heard of (but not
tried yet) a little in-line check valve that you can stick in the line to
the pump.  This supposedly will keep water from draining from the pump back
into the supply tank, and should keep it primed all the time.  I think
you can get this thing from any camper/trailer supply house.

Good luck, and let us know if it works!
