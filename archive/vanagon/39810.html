Sounds like clutch problems to me.

For a while, I had to cut off the engine to get mine in first. It went 
into reverse, but only after an ugly CLUNK.

It had a just-barely leaky front engine seal that mixed enough oil with the 
clutch-disc-dust to make the the clutch plate stick to the flywheel 
and/or pressure plate.

I replaced the seal and put on a new clutch plate (though I could have 
perhaps just cleaned the old one). Smooth shifting since then....
