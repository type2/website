FUNKENGROOVIN™ New Flash!					February
1, 1995

Hello FUNKENGROOVIN Subscribers,

You may be wondering why you haven’t received the latest edition of the
Vee Dub Chronicles™.  Never fear,  it’s on its way... just a bit behind
schedule.  This update is being sent as a letter of explanation for the
delay.  ( Inquiring minds want to know! )

First,  let us introduce ourselves,  Monique Dermaux and John Mottershaw
here!  As of today we are the new editors of FUNKENGROOVIN™   Dave
Wampler,  VW Enthusiast, father of FUNKENGROOVIN™ found  that he could no
longer continue as owner of FUNKENGROOVIN and editor of The Vee Dub
Chronicles.  He felt a great sense of responsibility toward FUNKENGROOVIN
and you -- the subscribers,  contributors, and supporters.  He began a
search for  someone  to continue the FUNKENGROOVIN™ magazine, The Vee Dub
Chronicles and the World Wide Web Page (http://www.vwgroovin_dot_com/groovin).
 He found us! We are the proud new owners of FUNKENGROOVIN.

We have taken over all aspects of operation.  We also edit our local North
Houston VW Club Newsletter.  We hope to bring to FUNKENGROOVIN a new level
of experience, perspective, and a great love for our favorite vehicle!

We will need a bit of time to familiarize ourselves with all the
nitty-gritty details of the operation and all the wonderful stories,
photos and art works that keep coming in.  ( You are sure a prolific
bunch... no shortage of subject matter for upcoming issues!)  So, please
be patient with us.   We plan to have the next issue to our subscribers 
in March.

The new address for FUNKENGROOVIN is:

FUNKENGROOVIN
16203 Avenplace Rd.
Tomball, TX 77375-8486
Phone (713) 370-2844
Email:  VWcruzin_at_aol_dot_com

Please be assured that even though the January-March issues of
FUNKENGROOVIN will be late so that we can make a complete transition, you
will receive the next four issues of The Vee Dub Chronicles, plus The Who
Do You Call Directory as promised ( just a little late, that’s all) !

Lastly, we’d like to thank Dave Wampler for getting  FUNKENGROOVIN  off
the ground, and providing us with this great opportunity to help connect
VW enthusiasts from all over the globe! 

Sincerely,

Monique Dermaux		John Mottershaw
