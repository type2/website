Thanks Steven and James for all the GREAT info on the Big
Sur area.  Hurrah for the showers!  As soon as I hear from
more people, we can set a date, and everyone can make
their own reservations via the 800 # for mistix I should
think.  Am hoping that there won't be much of a space
problem this time of year.  

So far on dates, there's a predominance of requests for
early January and for the weekend of December 10th.  Let 
me know!
