&gt; I hate to say this, but my immediate reaction was:
&gt; Okay, I'll subscribe to both lists...
&gt; I think people need better trash compactors (er, mail readers), or,
&gt; they should subscribe in digest mode.  I'd be happier if the list
&gt; stayed one. 

I feel the same way. Although I'm a waterwesty person now, I still 
plan to add some early buses along the way, and enjoy the views of 
*all* the volks on the list. 
I'll subscribe to both I guess. But then the volume never bothered me 
since it's still only about 10-15% of my mail... (good mail filters 
are the key!! :)
