Subject: ERRATUM: Re-padding seats: HOW TO


Ooops.... In discussing the posting I made last week with Christa, she 
pointed out I blew the instructions regarding removal/reinstallation of 
the seat cover for the bottom (that is, not the back) portion of the seat.

I'd said that both bottom and back of the seat have covers held in place 
by a series of little metal tabs holding a wire sewn into the base of the 
seat cover.  On our '76, this is true for the seat back, but NOT the seat 
bottom.

On our '76 westy, the seat bottom is held to the frame by a narrow strip 
of cardboard around which the bottom edge of the seat cover is wrapped.  
This cardboard strip is in turn inserted into a channel on the underside 
of the seat frame.  Looking at the underside of the seat after pulling 
the seat from the vehicle, the bottom of the seat cover will appear to 
just disappear into the frame without a fastener.  Closer inspection will 
reveal the channel holding the cardboard strip.

To remove, turn the seat upside down, and have a friend compress the seat 
cushion to give you some slack in the fabric to work with.  Christa had 
me stand on the over-turned frame.  Now you can pull at the edge of the 
fabic, bringing up the cardboard strip with it.  Ta da!

Reinstallation is, as they say, the reverse of removal.

I encourage anyone with lumpy, uncomfortable seats to spend a lazy rainy 
weekend on this cheap and straight-forward fix.  As St. Muir says, &quot;Come 
to kindly terms with your Ass for it bears you.&quot;
