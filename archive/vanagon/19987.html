&gt; &gt;On p. 248 of Idiot's manual, after removing the manifold side sections, 
&gt; &gt;it says to 'smoothe the insides of these two side pieces. They're pretty 
&gt; &gt;rough. Use emery ...'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What does this mean?  Why does it matter that the inside of the manifolds 
&gt; &gt;are rough... nothing but the air/fuel mixture goes through there?  How 
&gt; &gt;did it get rough anyway?  Guess I'm missing something here.  It must not 
&gt; &gt;be too critical since it can be done 'If there's somebody with nothing to 
&gt; &gt;do around...':).  Don't know many of those people these days.

&gt; Just the fuel air mixture?????
&gt; Have you ever heard the term &quot;blue printed&quot;?  I can assure you there are no
&gt; blue parts in the motor when done.  People spend lots of time polishing the
&gt; inside of intake runners, port to manifold connections, etc. in an effort to
&gt; increase the efficiency of their motors.  Maybe these people are somewhat
&gt; anal retentive, or they are racing, but it does help the motor to run
&gt; smoother, especially at high rates of flow.  If it were my motor I would
&gt; polish up obvious rought spots and leave the rest for the archeologists...
