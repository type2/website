Subject: Diesel Additive...

Hi Diesel People.  I have come across an excellent additive to lube, 
clean, and eliminating fuel waxing.  In Canada it is now mandatory to 
run on low-sulphur diesel.  This reduces the lubricity (sp?) of the 
fuel, and thus increases wear on the pump, and can cause plunger  sticking.  

I found out about an additive from  the rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled
newsgroup.  A fellow by the name of Dent (sorry, forgot your last name)
in Quebec is running 3 VW diesels and has had excellent results with this product.

The product is:  Stanadyne Performance Formula.  It comes in a 470 ml 
bottle and is good enough for 235 litres (ie. 4 tanks in a Golf).  
The price is also very reasonable.... $10.95 CDN.   I got it at the 
local GM dealer.  The local VW dealer sells this product as well .. 
for $16.95.  

So, for fellow Canadians running on diesel, you might want to check 
this product out.  I am sure that your local White/Volvo truck 
dealership might have this stuff as well.

Harry.
