&gt; ones that were not there (I was scratching up those nasty dress shoes I 
&gt; make myself wear to work).  BTW thanks to Mr. Stone in the People's

Where did you get the new pedal covers?

&gt; I do need to know how to get the middle seat out of this thing to finish 
&gt; cleaning up the carpet, I've given up trying to do it in the car, this is 
&gt; garden hose and dry in the sunshine work.  Previous owners were hauling 
&gt; well-behaved cattle.  The interior is very dirty but physically in very 
&gt; good shape.

You have to lift up the carpeting by removing the thin metal that runs 
along the floor by the door (three philips screws) and then the bench 
seat will slide out after removing the bolts that hold it into the floor.

&gt; coolant.  I bought two gallons of Sierra, a flush tee, downloaded a copy 
&gt; of the FAQ.

&gt; Anyone have any final warnings, or pearls of wisdom before I start all 
&gt; this stuff tomorrow afternoon?  Expecially on the coolant stuff--It seems 
&gt; like a daunting process--at least my driveway goes up hill!-- 

The coolant stuff really wasn't too bad.  Check out the archives -- use 
gopher to search.
Good luck and welcome!
