Subject: Re: Help With Used Car Pirces Please/F


&gt;I saw a picture of a used car piercing once.  There was this great big 
stake
&gt;sticking out of the ground with several used cars pierced on it.


Ever seen the Cadillac Ranch? Ten old big-tail-fin Caddies, buried nose
down in a field a few miles west of Amarillo, Texas. Just the back half
of each car sticking out. It's been there for years. Don't ask me why.
