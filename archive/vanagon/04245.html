Dear Group,
	Has anyone else in this group seen the real-time video software
called &quot;CUSeeMe&quot;? It runs on either Mac or PC machines and allows
multiple users to conference with video and sound over the internet. All
the information and software you need can be found via anonymous ftp at
gated.cornell_dot_edu in /pub/video. You need a camera and video spigot
system (or a Power Mac AV). The Exploratorium in S.F. has a demo going,
and I've been chatting with tourists and lots of kids. I'd really like
to meet some of you out there sometime. Uncle Joel should eat this up.
