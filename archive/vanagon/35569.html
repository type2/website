Subject: Throttle or Cruise Control for 84 Vanagon

Now that my vanagons head gaskets are fixed I plan to take it for a 
test drive from Michigan to California. Unfortunately, I do not have a 
cruise control. 

Do you have tips how to add... 

a) a mechanic throttle? (I already tried a brick) 
b) an electronic cruise control? If so, where could I buy one?

Thanks!
