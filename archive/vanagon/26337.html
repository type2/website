Subject: Re: What size engine came in a '50 or '51 bus?


&gt;By the way, I can't remember my best friends' phone numbers anymore, but I
&gt;can remember my first car's SN, Motor #, and, of course, my US Army ID #.
&gt;For those old enough to appreciate the difference, it was US, not RA.

For us ignorant young sprouts, what is the significance?
