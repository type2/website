Subject: Exhaust &quot;popping&quot; noises in 85GL

I don't know if this is something that just started happening after my
recent engine replacement, or I am just noticing it now with Spring weather
and the windows being down but when I am &quot;coasting&quot; downhill (wheels driving
engine) I hear popping sounds coming from the exhaust--vauely reminsicent on
my 1975 and 1979 Rabbits.

Any cause for concern, or is my catalytic converter finally spitting out its
contents after 150,000 miles.
