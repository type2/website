Subject: lost 83 vanagon diesel sighted

     Hi vanagon folks
     
     Joel 'F. Gump&quot; Walker just got me hooked back in to the vanagon list 
     after a three year hiatus
     
     hope everyone is more wiser than older (i am just keeping even)
     
     FOr the newcomers(?) I have a 1983 diesel Vanagon that has survived 
     the upstate NY winters for 14 years now still looking great. Only have 
     85k on her but she still starts at the turn of a key and toodles down 
     I88, I90, and I87 at 60 mph (but not much more)
     
     I will have it on the sales block this fall as I have too many cars in 
     the driveway, and the company just gave me a caravan (talk about no 
     character) - ill cry when 'BlueBus' goes because its the first car my 
     wife and I conned the bank into loaning us money to buy together in 
     1987.....
     
     
     
     How are the diesels holding up out there?
