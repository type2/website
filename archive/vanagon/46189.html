&gt; &gt;&gt;Well, here's the scoop: I'm riding Goodyear Regatta touring 
tires, size &gt;  P195/70R14 _at_ 36 psi all around.&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; The manual states that the tire pressures should be 30 front, 40 rear. Does
&gt; anyone know if other pressures give improved performance?
&gt; 
I've found running the rear at max pressure rated on the tire is 
usually best. I'm running re-inforced Conti's on the rear at 42psi (2 
psi over max), and LT rated Yokos on the front at 44-50 psi. (I 
reduce the pressure on rough roads to soften the ride a bit.)
(Because the front are not re-inforced the pressures are higher, and 
max pressure is 65psi.) The factory rating gives about 10psi 
difference for Reinf vs non-Reinf, I think.

For me, the rear seems to affect handling the most, while the front 
pressure mainly affects the ride quality. A drop of 5psi at the rear 
is quite noticeable on the highway.
