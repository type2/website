Sean,
I think you're barking up the wrong tree.  I haven't been following the
thread but it doesn't sound like a ground prob to me.  It sounds more like
a positive wire problem or a bad relay.  Are you sure that juice is getting
to the signal switch and relay?  Use a test light to check the current flow
from the fuse to the switch and then to the relay and then to the lights.

Possible problems are a broken wire, bad fuse, corroded fuse holder,
corroded wire connector, or a short.  Since nothing works, I would guess
that the lights, sockets, and gounds are okay and the problem lies under
the dash.  Actually, I'll go further, I'll bet that there is no juice going
to the switch and the problem is between the fuse box and the switch.
Good luck.

James

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;Well, I am continuing to see if I can find the cause of my mysterious turn
&gt;signal problems on my '78 bus.
&gt;
&gt;For anyone who has missed it so far, my turn signals and flashers do
&gt;not work.  For all practical purposes, the relay is not switching when
&gt;either switch is moved to the on position.
&gt;
&gt;So, tonight I chased ground wires down under the dash in an attempt to
&gt;find out the cause.  I found out something interesting:  When one of the
&gt;ground wires was pulled off of the ground surface, the problem
&gt;continued unaffected, i.e. it is doing the same thing as when it is
&gt;supposedly grounded.  This leads me to believe that I have a bad ground
&gt;somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;I traced a ground wire to the rear of the instrument panel, which I then
&gt;pulled off and proceeded to clean up nicely.  This did not fix the problem.
&gt;Then I traced the wire that's connected to that ground wire over to the
&gt;hazard flasher switch.  I cleaned that one up all nice and shiny but still no
&gt;luck.  I took off the steering wheel in search of the turn signal switch
&gt;ground but found none.  Am I correct in saying that the turn signal switch
&gt;grounds through the hazard flasher switch?  The only ground wire that
&gt;runs up through the steering column is the ground wire for the headlight
&gt;dimmer switch.  And of course, the one for the wiper switch, but that
&gt;one doesn't concern me right now.
&gt;
&gt;Are there any grounds I've missed?  I'd like to remove the ground wire
&gt;from the relay console to clean it up.  Can I just pull it out or is it
&gt;permanently fastened in there?  I couldn't easily get it out when I tried -- it
&gt;didn't want to go anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;Are there any other grounds in the turn signal/hazard flasher system that
&gt;I need to attend to?  Looking at the wiring diagram in Bentley I don't see
&gt;any and I also didn't see any under the dash.
&gt;
&gt;Could my bad ground be located elsewhere, like one of the bulb sockets?
&gt;It wouldn't be one of the front ones as the parking lights and front side
&gt;marker lights still work.  All the bulbs are good.  I know because I've
&gt;checked them by plugging them into other sockets where they promptly lit
&gt;up.  How would I check the bulb sockets for a bad ground?  I have a
&gt;multimeter and a test lamp.
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a lot in advance,
&gt;Sean
