&gt; Hi Gang!

&gt; The wife, son and I are hopping into our 92 Eurovan Westfalia and heading

&gt; 
&gt; We'd appreciate any info on camping or VW Westy camping parts suppliers in
&gt; the area.

I could be mistaken but I don't believe the EV Westy 'CAMPER' was sold in 
this country.  I know I've never seen one.  THe Westy toped weekender was 
sold but I don't think there is much crossover in parts beyond the 
standard Volkswagen stuff.

BUT if you come down through the Washington Metropolitan area  wave when 
you're on '95 south of DC.  I've seen more Eurovans in this area than 
anyone else seems to have seen in the rest of the country.
