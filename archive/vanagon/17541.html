&gt; Well, ahem.... If I don't have a temp gauge or pressure indicator on my

Get gauges.  I don't know how people can live not knowing what is going on
inside their engine!  :)
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I should get some instrumtation going. Any recommendations for 
&gt; effective setups? Do you recommend remote sensors or a &quot;real&quot; line all 
&gt; the way up to the front??

Remote electric sensors are the only way to go in the bus, because of the
distance involved.  VDO gauges are the best, and they make all the right
senders to fit air cooled VW's (and others, of course).  I would get oil
pressure first, then oil temperature, then cylinder head temp in that
order.  Each gauge should cost you around $50 for a set consisting of 
sender and gauge.  The 2-1/16&quot; VDO gauges look real nice in the dash of
a breadloaf.
