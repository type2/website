Scanning my list of catalogs I came across this one...

 MSDS                         (Martin Schneider Designed Systems)
 2643 Rosemead BL.            Porsche engine kits for vanagons/buses,
 South El Monte, CA 91733     brake rotors/stainless steel brake hoses
 (818) 448-8726               for vanagons, 'Panzer Brush Guard' - for
 (818) 448-0706 FAX           mounting winches on vanagons (or just                                           keeping rocks and bushes out of your                                            grill/headlights)

I've never dealt with these guys so I don't know anything about them.
Hope it helps.
