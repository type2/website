Subject: Yet Another VW Web Site
Date: Tue, 27 Dec 1994 12:10:40 -0800 (PST)

Hey everyone,
	Well, I finally scraped together some stuff to put on a World
Wide Web VW page.  This page contains:

1.  GNATT tour information

	I hope to use this site to hold the latest information concerning
	the trip this summer.  Hopefully enough of you have access to
	WWW (World Wide Web) that it will be useful.  I am still entering
	data, and it is a tedious task, so I beg for your patience, and
	ask that you check back now and then for updates.

2.  Brazilian Bus pictures

	10 nice scans supplied by David Black of a pair of interesting
	foreign busses.

3.  Links to Skip's VW home page (which is much more complete than mine)
    and back to my home page, which has my non-VW stuff on it.


&quot;http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw&quot;

I hope this location won't change, but I am still learning this HTML stuff
and I may find that I have to move it to a different location...

Cheers,
	-David
