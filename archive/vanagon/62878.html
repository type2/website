Hey Now!

I'm am installing a CD player in my '87 GL.  I'm wondering about a
switched power source for the radio.  The ones I've found are only &quot;hot&quot;
when the key is in the &quot;ignition on&quot; position and I can hear the fuel
running.  Is there a source that is &quot;hot&quot; when the key is in the
position just before the &quot;ignition on&quot; position so that the CD will play
without having the fuel pump run?  I found one source that was &quot;hot&quot;
when you inserted the key in the ignition, but it didn't carry a current
in the &quot;ignition on&quot; poistion.

TIA
