Subject: Blinking Temp Light.

My temperature light has just started blinking too long after I start.  
It blinks for about 3 miles, or until the engine warms up.  Does anyone 
know what this indicates?  The owners manual doesn't say anything about 
it staying on -- just about it coming on while driving.  I didn't see 
anything in the shop manual in my brief perusal of the cooling section.

Thanks
