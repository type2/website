Subject: Rear Camber Adjustment, Vanagon

Reading the Vanagon list Archives I found reference to adjusting the 
rear camber as being relatively easy.  Is this something a home 
mechanic can do? or does one need the specialized equipment of an 
alignment shop.  I asked my local VW dealer, they indicated that it 
was difficult and expensive.  I have been wearing out tires on the 
inside, enough to negate any warranty on the 37K I have gotten out of 
my 80K tires.  (insert incessant whiny voice here:  If the tires wear 
unevenly they are not covered in the warranty . . ).  Even without the 
uneven wear I can't say that I recommend Sumitomo tires.

I can envision a relatively simple jig mounted on the side rear 
window with a vertical bar hanging down and measuring the top and 
bottom of the rim to determine camber.  With the offset between these 
fixed positions providing a indication of angle, allowing adjustments 
to be measured.  Assuming proper gas, water, oil loads on very level 
ground with tires properly inflated.

BTW, how DO you adjust the camber?

I need the front adjusted also.  What are the possibilites of home 
mechanics doing this?

I keep getting unsubscribed to the Vanagon list somehow, so am only 
on the Type II list.
