Subject: Re: Oil cooler for 81 Westy

Weston -

I run a similar cooler setup we sell on my 80 Vanagon.  Myself, I mounted the
cooler up front behind the air grille to really catch the cool air.  Ran
copper lines about 2/3 the way back to the engine (where I mounted the oil
filter just head of the rear left tire), then hoses from there to the engine.
 Some list members mentioned a possibility of a loss in oil pressure, but it
was insignificant in my case, ran just fine.  I've run similar systems on
other Bugs and Buses I own (and have owned) with little or no problem -
usually mounted them to the front axle beam assembly used on these years
(thru 79).

A popular location is near the transmission, mounted at an angle to catch the
air flow, but I've always resisted that because of possible &quot;road heat&quot; being
caught up into it.
