&gt;boy! that was quick!&lt;

I wish you'd tell my wife that *or maybe she already knows ;-)* ! It 
took me four 8-9 hour days, back to back. That's not including the time 
to get all the parts, tools, and a lot study time! I really did work 
slow though. I ended up leaving the engine in and took a suggestion to 
really clean the engine first (smart!). Maybe this accounted for the 
time, I don't know, but I couldn't get hold of an engine stand and 
honestly, I was a bit scared to take it out. Maybe next time:) Anyway, 
I'll work on some notes/observations that aren't in the archive 
already. Joel, thanks again for all the info!
