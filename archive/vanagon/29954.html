mike

as mark said the year of manufacture should be on the back of the speedo. what year is your bus? 
there is a 58' panel in the wrecker w/ a speedo in it. as fa r as i can see sppedo chaanges from 56--&gt; 
67' are mostly aesthetic.

&gt; &gt; I am not sure if the Pioneer has the correct speedometer or not.  Do 
&gt; &gt; you have any info on what it should look like exactly?  Were there 
&gt; &gt; differences in the early years?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if they did it for your year bus, but my '62 has
&gt; the date of manufacture of the speedo stamped on the back of it,
&gt; it's a month or two before the date of the bus. . . .
