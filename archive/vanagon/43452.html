&gt;Dear list,
&gt;  I recently got my hands on a couple of COIL SPRING ADJUSTERS from jc
&gt;whitneys. They're supposed to remedy the &quot;sagging rear end&quot; that all loafers
&gt;know about. What these things do is basically pry apart a section of the rear
&gt;coil spring, with the net effect of raising the rear end somewhat.

What rear coil spring?  Breadloaves don't come with coils in the rear.

I put on some heavy-duty shocks that have coil springs built onto them, and
while I only measured an inch more height at the rear bumper, the effect
seems much greater.  The bus no longer looks like it sags in the rear, and
it handles large loads much better.  I'm very satisfied with them.
