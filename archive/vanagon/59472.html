&gt;Here's a number, but I don't know if the guys phone is still connected
&gt;as his business is either being destroyed or is undergoing MAJOR
&gt;reconstruction.... (717)-755-5718.

It's been really weird to watch this old VW repair place disappear. I 
haven't had a chance to stop and ask what's going on, but they are 
disassembling this cinderblock building piece by piece and carting it 
away--in a Transporter pickup, no less! (the pickup is probably '68-'74, 
haven't checked real closely).

It's not a huge building, but it's not a small building, either.
These guys charge typically high (IMHO) prices for cars, so I woudn't 
expect the Synchro to go for a steal. However, they hate water cooled 
VWs, so they may be willing to part with it for less.
They also have a Split camper, but lotsa rust and no furniture (or 
engine, I think). The owner once told me he had the furniture up in his 
attic, though. (?)
