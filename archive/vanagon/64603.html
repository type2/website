Subject:      Help! I need an AFM

I have been looking for awhile for an air-flow meter for my 81 vanagon.
Someone said it makes a difference if it is a california or non-california
vehicle. Is this true? I have tried to set the air box myself. Since it has
already been opened up, I figured I couldnt do any more damage than has
already taken place. I have the Hanes manual and have set the timing right
on. The mixture and idle speed however are not cooperating with me. Does
that
sound like I am looking in the wrong direction? Could it be something else
that i am missing? Someone from the newsgroup told me that I may have a
vacuum leak. I checked it out and found no leaks under or on top of the
engine. I plan on just letting a shop do the complete diagnosis, It has
taken
me about 6 mos. to get were I am at so far. I have been looking for a job
in
the meantime, so have not really worked on my faithful workhorse as well as
I
should have. Does it make a big difference what kind of bosch plugs I am
using? I am using platinums right now because they give me a more favorable
I
have had them in for 6 mos. They appear to be burning clean. My 02 sensor
however, has a thick black deposit on it indicating that it is running a
little too rich. It sure smells like it is. I have tried to lean it up some
but like I said before the idle and mixture adjustments are not working.
Any
Idea's? Thanks
