Subject: camping

Got back from a successful camping and canoeing trip in Front Royal Va.  
Met up with my uncle and his 76 westy.  Both campers performed extremly 
well in the mts, even pass a couple of cars on a steep upgrade!  The 
weather was wonderful as was the river and scenery.  It was the begining 
of three camping weekends and was a great start.
