&gt; I have one of those acoustic couplers that are supposed to work with pay 
&gt; phones, But it's not too reliable. Sure would be nice to sit at the edge 
&gt; of the ocean at Big Sur, California (two hours away) and connect up to 
&gt; the net!

At home I have a 486-50 with 16Megs ram and 600 Megs of hard drives.  I'd 
love to get a notebook, but then I'd have to settle for something less 
than what I'm used to.  Besides, I don't have enough $$ left to get one. 
:) 

If I did have something, I think I could make do without the acoustic 
couplers.  They are only good up to about 9600, and I can find a phone 
line to tap into anywhere.
