I'd say that an ammeter would be my third preference, so that you can keep an
eye on the charging system.  But..... given that you need to run some really
big wires quite a ways to accomplish this, I'll be opting for a voltmeter in
the near future when I add gages to my van.  A voltmeter doesn't give you
quite the information of the ammeter, but it's a whole lot easier to install
- especially the way a Vanagon is wired.

Good luck,
