Subject: re: Westy tents

Well, I called down to the Baja to see about one of them there adobe camper
tents Veeduber told me about...

Seems they'll make one to order for next to nothing, but the shipping costs
to get it up here to Seattle were a wee bit high.

Guess I'll keep looking.

Fella from Anchorage sent me email about a so-called &quot;solid aqua&quot; tent but
it was a seasonal item that is currently out of stock. Oh well.

Keep them cards and letters coming.

Jeff
