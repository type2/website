Subject: misfirin' monday blues...

Volks,

Freewayed  in to werk this morning, as usual.  Bonus was the warm, 
sunny spring morning.  Ocassional misfire hinted at maybe replacing 
the spark plug wires, check the platinums at some point over the next 
few weeks.
     Had to leave cross town for an appointment.  Back on the 
freeway.  Able to hold it at 55, but the occasional misfire could now 
be classified as frequent.  Humm... I just adjusted the valves 
yesterday.  Could my neglect to retork the heads (supposed to do this 
at 300 miles, promised to do it a 500, now approaching 1000)?  Naw, 
got to be the &quot;sparking&quot; system..  No time to pull over and check, 
got to keep tardy for my 9:30. 
      After the 9:30 gig, I pop open the engine lid.  The high 
tension wire from the ignition coil is completely off but close 
enough to gap.  I can't believe it even ran.......
