I've talked to Al Knoll by phone.  His server is still down, which is
the reason he hasn't been able to post to the list, but he has asked
me to tell all of you that he confirmed our presence at Panamint
Springs this coming weekend with his friend Jerry, who is affiliated
with the resort there at Panamint, and says we will not need
reservations.  There are apparently some camping spots.  If
they become full, there is as I understand it some overflow into
a nearby circle or oval (I think) open field, where can all
be &quot;together.&quot;  He said that the sites are $7 w/o electricity,
and $11 with.  

Bring stuff to make chili.  Due to the typical disorganized
nature of all this, I'm not going to try and organize who's
bringing what type of food ahead of time.  Just bring stuff 
like chili, and things that go well with, and we'll just
try throwing in everything, and sharing, I suppose.  Hope
that will work out.  

If anyone needs to phone me, feel free to do so (although I
can be hard to reach, but ok to leave message on the tape) at:
510.376.4321.
