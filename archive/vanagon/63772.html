&lt;&lt; One question - an ad in my local paper says a Westy
 has a &quot;jump seat&quot;.  I havent heard anything about this on the list.  What
 is it? &gt;&gt;

Presumably it is a westy w/ the optional cargo floor tracks and the optional
single swivel seat that slid into these tracks, or the westy was outfitted w/
the removeable theatre style rear facing seat from a Wolfsburg edition, or
Carat Vanagon.
both desireable items.

good luck in your search,
chris
