&gt;You Said-
&gt;&lt;who is st. Christopher?
&gt;
&gt;I say, YOU HEATHEN : )
&gt;St. Christopher was the patron saint of travel (and probably other things)
&gt;I think he was excommunicated (probably for driving a D*dge C*ravan)
&gt;
&gt;I think that's who he was anyway.........

St Christopher is indeed the patron saint of travel, he is normaly
represented as and old man with a stick and a young boy on his back
crossing a river, he always has a haylo (sp?). I'm not too sure of
the story behind why he is carrying the boy. anybody know?
I'm not religious but this sort of thing intrests me.
