Subject: Re: 59 single cab question

Jason,
Gotta keep it quick and get back to work. I installed a 1600sp w/ dual
Kadrons and a '67 tranny w/3.88 ring and pinion with super beetle 3rd and
4th into our '57 single cab and it works great. Minor alteration must be
made to the body tranny yoke for the tranny to clear on install. Minor die
grinder stuff. Remember, you had a split case tranny which is a different
shape. Changing to 12v is a no brainer. Ask your local VW guru or look in
the FAQs.

&gt;Can I put my spare 1600 (70) engine into my 59 (If I make all the necessary
&gt;6 volt conversion).
