Subject: Overheating Eng, Why ?


I just completed a partial teardown of my 82' Vanagon, aircld, fi, 2.0L
engine (including rebuilt heads). I've got about 400 miles on this rebuild
and it seems to be running hot. The air flaps are FULL open (i've checked,
double-checked, etc.). I'm going to double check the valve adjustments in
the morn. The vehicle makes a hard &quot;tacking' sound when cold, but sound
disappears after the engine is warm. Sounds like maybe the lifters, but
after 400 miles they should be &quot;air&quot; free ? Could the sound be something
else (piston slap, valves ?) ... something that could account for the
overheating ?

Your comments would be graeatly appreciated.

Thanks, Chris.

For those in S. Cal (particularly San Diego), is it me or are salvage
yards here generally VW-free. I must have hit 5-6 yards today, and many
had ZERO or just a token VW here or there. Many a year ago, they were
relatively easy to find in salvage yards in San Pedro (Long Beach) and
Garden Grove.
