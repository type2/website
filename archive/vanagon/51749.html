&gt;&gt; ...and two lads 19 and 21 both of whom
&gt;&gt; love to speed and don't mind getting tickets (actually each only 1 ticket
&gt;&gt; every 18 months or so, not too bad considering their ages).

When I was 16 and got my license my father said &quot;you get 1 moving violation 
and you don't drive again until you are 21&quot;.  I'll tell you what, to this day 
I still have no tickets or a single accident and I'm 32 years old.  If I had 
someone paying my insurance and tickets you better believe I'd have (and 
still) been driving like an ass*(&amp;( like so many people out there.
