  the Fuse?

Mark,

You'll get a comfortable 3+ weeks using the fridge on gas all the time ,and
cooking twice a day.
We usually  refill at two weeks (compulsive), but it's always embarrassing,
since the thing is never more than half empty.

&gt;Bob,
&gt;How many days will the fridge run on one tank of propane, I will be
&gt;doing the Baja run myself soon and running that thing for better than a
&gt;week straight or better. I knew the propane would be much better, but I
&gt;don't know (and must know) how long I can expect cold groceries on a
&gt;continuous run with the Dometic on propane max cold mode?
