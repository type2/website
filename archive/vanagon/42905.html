Subject: St.Pons

Hey Michael, I'll ask these questions of you seeing that I've met you and know 
that your VW bent is definitely fanatical; If you were to compare Ben Pons to 
St.Paul, would Ferdinand Porsche be considered like St.Peter? Is there a 
Shrine?; I.E.VWoA or Bad Camberg, Wolfsburg? What relics would one wear to 
show  a state of piety and devoutness? Is there a prayer to St. Pons?  Is 
there a order of St. Pons?How does one know when he or she has been blessed 
with the grace of St.Pons? The devout, fanatical and rabid among us await some 
clarification to these matters. Talk to you soon! Tom Czerniak
