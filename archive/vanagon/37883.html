Subject: '88 Front step Rust Repair

Still catching up on mail after a weekend with our new Westy :)

On the topic of rust repair - has anyone found a long term solution 
for rust around the 4 little holes under the rubber mats in the 
Vanagon door steps? Mine has pretty serious rust here, and judging by 
the amount of road spray from below, any normal repairs would be 
futile. 

I was thinking of removing all the rust, then fiberglassing over (or 
under, from below) the area, then making a 'mud flap' for the inner 
front side of the wheel well to deflect the road spray.

Any suggestions?

ps: Our first outing was driveway camping only, but still great..!
