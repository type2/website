Subject: Re: Go with the door sticker.....
Date: Mon, 24 Feb 97 9:42:04 EST

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I just bought a set of reinforced Michelin X tires for my 86 Westfalia. The
&gt; &gt;max tire pressure is 40 psi, yet the sticker on the door calls for 48 psi in
&gt; &gt;the rear tires. The dealer (Wheelworks, a large chain in the SF Bay Area)
&gt; &gt;insists that they are the correct tires. What's going on here?
&gt; 
&gt; The tire recommendation is for a wide range of vehicles, including cars. 
&gt; The sticker is for that tire on your individual vehicle 
&gt; 
&gt; You have a much heavier van.
&gt; 
&gt; I inflated to the door sticker pressure, despite the 40psi on my tires.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion.

Dave,
NO NO NO!!  This is wrong and may get you killed one day.  The number
printed on the tire -- the Max. Cold Inflation Pressure -- is just that.
the MAXIMUM.  If you inflate the tire more than this, you risk
catastrophic tire failure.  This is because as the tire heats up when
driving, the air inside expands, increasing pressure.  Eventually you
will get to the point where the tire fails.  Then, you read on teh Type
2 list about a fellow who rolled his Westy when the right rear tire
blew.  

The sticker on the door is good but only if you buy tires that can
handle the inflation pressure listed on teh sticker.  The max on the
tire is first as far as authority, the sticker is second.  NEVER inflate
beyond the max on the tire, no matter what the sticker says.  Then go
out and buy proper tires for your vehicle.
