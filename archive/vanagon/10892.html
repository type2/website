I do not believe that the author of the 1964 Transporter manual was
telling an un-truth when it came to the description of the Typ2
having an execellent heating system....you have to understand,
the author spent from 1941 thru 1943 testing the heaters on
Kubelwagens during the Russian winters!  8-)
