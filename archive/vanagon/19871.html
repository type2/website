Hello,

About 10,000 miles ago I put AlumaSeal in my cooling system.  It was a last resort to stop a leaking headbolt that I tried sealing in all the traditional ways, including VW's $6/tiny tube sealer.  It has worked perfectly.  Since I live in Phoenix, I can't say much about heater performance, but there have been no cooling problems.

I looked at BarsLeak as well, but decided to go the AlumaSeal way because I liked the idea of tiny bits of aluminum clogging the holes rather than sticky stuff plugging them.  I also though that perhaps the aluminum powder might react rather than my cylinder heads pit.  It wasn't any more scientific than that, and I would have tried BarsLeak next.

Mike
