Subject: Driving in high winds
Date: Mon, 7 Nov 94 9:06:42 EST

Last night driving down the freeway , I had a heck of a time staying in
the lane and keeping up the speed of the Vanagon above 50mph. I was
driving directly against winds betwen 80 and 90 kmh (50-55 mph). Is it
&quot;normal&quot;  for Vanagon handling to be compromised by high winds? Will
reinforced tires help the situation (I have C tires in the back only).
Plus driving into the wind is like driving a barn door into a hurricane,
speed becomes a mute issue except going downhill. DC  --
