    The motor for some reason thinks it is already warm. You do not
    state  the Type of vehicle/ motor etc.    Eric

&gt; I would appreciate any thoughts on the following problem.  When starting

&gt; engine.  After about 5 to 6 starts you can move forward but it boggs out to
&gt; almost a stall for about the first 1/8th mile.  I have tried giving it more
&gt; gas, less gas, putting it in neutral and &quot;clearing it out&quot;-nothing seems to
&gt; make any difference.  Once you get past the critical 1/th mile or so, it's
&gt; fine but not as much power pulling hills as before.  Even if you shut down
&gt; after driving awhile it will be a little rough starting up again.  The
&gt; longer you wait to start again, the more it happens.
&gt;
&gt; If you have had the same problem and found a fix I would really appreciate
&gt; your help.
