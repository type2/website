&gt; In the last post I had 179 miles on my new engine, now I have almost 1000!  
&gt; I drove to northern virginia over spring break, which accounts for 600 
&gt; miles.  I found out why my valves are getting looser:  The adjustment screws 
&gt; are wearing out in a very short time.  It took only 500 miles to get the 
&gt; screws to be so hammered that the ends were no longer convex.  I can't 
&gt; figure out why this is, I had adjusted them to .006&quot; every 100~200 miles.  I 
&gt; replaced all the screws in no. va. and adjusted the valves, and now after 
&gt; only 400 miles the same thing is happening.  This is crazy! How do I fix 
&gt; this problem?  I had also replaced the screws at rebuild time, and the guy 
&gt; in nova hasn't had this happen to him, how about those on the list?  

When I got my bus it had some wierd adjustment screws in it.  They had
small ball&amp;socket joints on the end of them, and a flat surface on the
ball.  Pretty clever, cause it allowed a consistant flat surface against
the tip of the valve.  Maybe you can find some of these for your engine?
Maybe they were Porsche parts?  Anyone know?
