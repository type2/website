Hi.
 These are the tires that I am using on my '81 Westy and I like them. I
originally chose them for their obvious price advantage and really
wasn't too concerned about road handling charachteristics, and I doubt
that I could evaluate them from that srandpoint. I practice 'low impact'
driving in my van, which is: to drive slowly, anticipate sharp turns
well in advance and never over estimate the performance of your VW
Vanagon. Therefore I'm of the opinion that the Uniroyal tires seem to be
plenty sufficient for carrying the weight of these hefty vehicles. To be
honest I've read plenty of long winded rhetoric on the advatages of
using the Michelins, Bridgestones, and Continentals, but I really don't
see the advantages that justify their prices. It makes me wonder what
sort of driving some folks are doing??? It's a Vanagon--it's sloooowww,
under powered, handles like an aircraft carrier, and it likes being that
way!
