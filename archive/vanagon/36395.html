Subject:      Re: (lack of) EV reliability

I have owned bugs,  things,  rabbits,  cabrios,  jettas,  and
currently own a passat wagon and an '83 waterwesty.  I have also
owned a subaru, a buick,  a nissan,  a volvo and an oldsmobile.  Do
you notice a pattern?  VW quality has been very consistant in my
opinion;  the problem with the other fecal-mobiles is that they all
fell apart after around 70k and had to be junked.  Every single VW
has been sold and are still around.  Maybe the others were not loved
en masse or maybe they were pieces of crap.  Yes, my passat had a
recall for power window clips and the timing belt snapped at
50,050 miles,  which if I were a whining prick would not have been
covered fully by VW. The reps love politeness, the service manager
said off the record...whining pricks get the 70%-80% or less
treatment.  So, I guess being respectful to our fellow man no matter
how loathsome their profession is pays off.  And by-the-way I am
certain that there are some real good toyota and mini-van sob stories
out there,  but the grass is always greener...digitized,  but greener.
