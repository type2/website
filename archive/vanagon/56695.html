Subject: 1985 VW vanagon

Hi,

I am looking for reliable transportation around town and for long trip
during the summer -- I am a student -- and have been offered a 1985 vw
vanagon which apparently needs a new engine, for $1,000.

What are these vans like? Are they reliable, economical, good on long
trips, where can I get a new engine, how much does one cost and who in
Berkeley, CA would be good person to get to inspect/install new engine?


That's a lot to ask, but any info would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Geoff
