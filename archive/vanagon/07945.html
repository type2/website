&gt;  
&gt;   You know, what we really need is a European VW dealer, online, from which we 
&gt;   could order parts. If purchases were done with credit cards, the currency 
&gt;   exchange rate problems should be taken care of. Using email should prevent 
&gt;   any odd-hours phone calls. Does anybody know of such a dealer?

    Well there is one here in Coventry called Volksline that seems to
  pride itself on dealing with overseas orders; its walls are covered
  in letters from all over the place asking for the most obscure bits n
  pieces. However, they have no email capability (Dave, the owner is probably
  unaware of its existance), but seem to be happy to business by letter or
  phone.

  In my dealings with them I've had both good and bad service, so if you
  use them be very specific about the required part(s) and year of model.

  Volksline can be reached on ENGLAND 0203 602333.

  (I've no connection with the above other than they seem to take
  money from me on a distgustingly regular basis :( )
