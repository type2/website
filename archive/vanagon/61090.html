Subject: Re: Hi Speed Vanagoning

The laminar airflow across a vehicle turns to turbulent as it leaves the 
rear.  Some of that turbulent flow will be reduced if there is another 
vehicle close behind to &quot;grab&quot; the airflow.  Laminar flow creates lift, 
and turbulent flow creates drag.  

Last winter we had quite a bit of snow in western Washington.  I 
frequently travel by car from Seattle to Bellingham, and on one occassion 
saw an accident in the snow on Interstate 5 just north of Seattle where a 
Vanagon had run into the back of a cement mixer.  The mixer's &quot;funnel&quot; 
was in the back seat of the van.  

Also, about tires, one time in southern California on the 210 freeway in 
the middle of the night I ran into a tire which had just blown off of a 
semi truck's wheel.  I was driving my Scirocco, and the tire and frontal 
spoiler (air dam) both bounced and dragged under my car until I could pull 
over.  The spoiler broke in half, and in a few other places too.  At 
least I wasn't right behind the truck when it blew, or it could have come 
right at my window.
