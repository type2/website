Subject: Idel - 86 Syncro
Date: Sat, 14 Dec 96 14:12:00 CDT


Last month I the engine was removed from my 86 Syncro, ever since the idel 
has run higher.  Initially 3K and now approx 2K.  At times it idels noramlly 
at approx 1K - which usually happens when the engine has warmed and been 
shut down for a short amount of time.  Other than that there is no pattern 
to the normal 1K idel.

Is it possible to adjust the idel?

Could the problem be a vacuum leak somewhere?

Happy Vanagoning
