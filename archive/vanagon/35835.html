&gt;     Assuming I don't need anything else too major, looks like a
&gt;     pretty good deal so far!
&gt;--------------------
&gt;I'd say so! An '82 Westy Diesel was going for $9995 in my area last 
&gt;week - sold by the time I called... aarrghh.

Are you kidding? $9995 for an '82 diesel!!! I'll definitely drive mine to 
BC if I need to sell it. (Not that I would ever volounteerly part from
it)
