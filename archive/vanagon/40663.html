Yep, its an official EV model....the GT, as VWT&amp;A put it:
&quot;The EV is one bitchin' sano van....with plenty of room for a kick ass 
stereo system.....all the babes go for it...&quot;

EV GT Specs:

Engine - detuned Audi IMSA 5 cylinder 20V turbo - 350 hp
Drive train - Audi Quatro Rally 4WD system

Suspension - Double wishbone suspension front and rear, Penske adjustable 
shocks, 1.25&quot; front swaybar (adjustable), 1.5&quot; rear swaybar

Body - roof chopped and lowered 2&quot; from stock MV

Wheels - 16X7 alloy, Pirelli Zero 250/40 x 16 tires

Full Kamei aero package (front spoiler, aero grille, side skirts, and rear 
wing)


In his editorial, VWT&amp;A editor, Dan Bedwetter, had this to say:

&quot;I understand why our models got stiff nipples after standing next to the 
EV GT...just driving the EV GT gave ME a stiffie!&quot;


Satiricly yours...

Ric
