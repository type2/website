Subject: No Mail!!! Wha'???

Vanagon List Goers:

    For reasons I don't understand I no longer get any mail from the list. I
guess I've been unsubcribed....probably by some evil, hacker Chevy
owner....foiled again!
    Could someone please just e-mail me the directions again for subscribing
to the list?? I tried but did it wrong and now the internet mailman's all
pissy with me. 
    Please??? Thankyou!
