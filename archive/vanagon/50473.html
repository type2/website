&gt; Howdy, Could someone point me to the page(s) in the Bentley which illustrate

      Grease???? what's that your kids will ask!

      Greasing a vehicle is old fashion. To the best of my
      Knowledge there is nothing to grease on a Vanagon!
      Just change the Engine Oil. That seams to be hard enought!
