&gt;I am wondering what everyone out there thinks is a reasonable
&gt;price to pay for a set of four 14&quot; X 6&quot; factory Vanagon alloy wheels.
&gt;
&gt;Has anybody bought a set or heard what people are paying for them
&gt;lately ?

Someone was selling a set of five with good tires on the list a few 
months ago for $750.  Really wanted 'em for my '73, but couldn't pony 
up the dollars.  There's a junkyard in the area that has a set of four, 
no tires, for $650.  Unfortunately, they are a pretty RARE wheel and 
most people will get for them what the market will bear.....

BTW, that price is for NY.....out West any better?
