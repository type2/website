Subject: Re: Crashworthiness of Bug Vans /Cadillacs

Never had a wreck in a Bus (the driving position seems to make me more 
aware of traffic situations).  I did get hit in *my* '57 Cadillac Sedan de 
Ville.  Some kid stopped at a red light and forgot to look to his left 
before he pulled out.  I nailed him (well, he hit me right at my front 
wheel), but it barely fazed the Caddy (4700 lbs.) and only felt like a 
slight bump.  Damage to the hubcap, fender, and front door (luckily 
missed the front bumper, you know, the one with the big Dagmars).  The 
Chevy Citation was in pieces all over the intersection.  No one hurt.
Fixing it was another &quot;body shop from hell&quot; story and is as non-VW 
related as this, so I'm done ...

&gt; This stirs up some bitter memories for me.  My grandmother kept her 57 Coupe
&gt; de Ville in her barn since '68 because she had a scarey brake loss
&gt; experience with it.  It only had 30k miles on it and was just waiting for a
&gt; fix-n-drive.  She sold it in '82 for a pittance once I got my driver's
&gt; license. She knew I loved it and didn't want me to get hurt driving it.
&gt; Haven't spoken to grandma since... ;-)
