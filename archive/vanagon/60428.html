&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 	I am going to replace the rear shocks on my '86 Westy.  Looking
&gt; through the archives led me to think that the KYB Gas-A-Just were the way
&gt; to go.  There was a entry that spoke of them being on sale somewhere for
&gt; under $30 ea., that was quite some time ago and they are no longer
&gt; available.  So I am wondering if anyone out there has a hot source for
&gt; these at a low low bargain price:) Or any other price for that matter.
How
&gt; about you BusBoys or Ron Salmon Inc.?  What are your prices? Thanks a
ton.

Cory,
$26.50 each.  This for Gas Adjust rears and GR2 fronts (there are no Gas
Adjust fronts for a Vanagon).
