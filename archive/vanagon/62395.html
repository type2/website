Subject: '86 still plagued! (was rich running) - SOLVED!!!

Hi Volks,

Thanks to ALL of you for the great guidance and support!

Due to problems with the '71 (another post), I was able to spend some time
on Sunday rechecking the '86 and following everyone's suggestions. Today at
lunch, I picked up another new fuel pressure regulator, temp sensor and 02
sensor from the dealer to swap/test again. 

The fuel pressure regulator did the trick!!!

I had originally replaced this with a used one from Indian Vic back during
the first round in March. I guess I should have suspected this, but...

Oh well, all is well in my vw world again!

Thanks everyone for all the help!!

Off to play some frisbee golf and enjoy the day!
