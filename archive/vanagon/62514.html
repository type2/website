&gt;The phone number I have for Country Homes has been disconnected.  Does
&gt;anyone have a phone number more recent than 441-6280?

Ron, Country Homes went out of business one or two weeks ago.  Apparently=

not enough demand to stay in business.  Loosing money for a few years
according to Salim the owner (former).  I do not have his home phone.
