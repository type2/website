  There is a difference in Hatch Struts;  Those of you who have Rear 
Wiper motors have a Heavier Hatch!  VW made 2 different Part #'s, one 
was the Right and one Left.  These struts have 2 different rates of 
shock!  One to compensate for the weight of the Wiper Motor!

  If you install 2 of the stiffer hatch struts on your Vanagon, they'll 
last much Longer than if you install a Right and a Left.

  I only Install and Sell the Right one.  None of our (Volks Cafe) 
customers have complained that the struts lasted too long!  I hate to 
open a Customers Vanagon and have to get my Speacial tool to hold it 
open because they have BAD hatch struts.  At $50.00 a pair for German 
struts, why wouldn't you have a good set on your Van?  

  I'm not trying to sell any hatch struts, just give the LIst the info 
on Right and Left struts.
