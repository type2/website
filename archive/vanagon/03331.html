David wirtes that he did not see very any other &quot;vans&quot; in europe
other than VW...

I saw plenty in France, Switz, and Germany this past January...
Renault Espaces, Ford Transits, even a bunch of Plymouth Voyager
types from the US. The vans are there...

There is even a neat van set up mfgd by Mercedes.
