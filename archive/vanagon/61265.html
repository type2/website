Malcolm,
The Yakima and gutter kit will work fine.  Be careful of the skylight when
sliding your board on.  I've switched to a short board so usually just
leave it and the rest of the gear inside.  When on a long trip with the
wife and dog the gear moves to the roof.  The effort to open the roof with
the gear up there will increase and you'll need to watch the mast bases if
the rear hatch is up.  
Good luck,
Neal

&gt; Does anyone have any words to the wise regarding the idea of putting 
&gt; gutter-mount roof racks (Yakima) on the pop-up top of a Westy, using bolt

&gt; on adaptors? I'm looking at a max load of maybe 100 lbs., and usually 
&gt; much less. My usual load will be windsurfing masts, and I'd rather be 
&gt; able to open the top with them still attached. Comments, anyone?
