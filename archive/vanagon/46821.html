&gt; Amen to that - I'd like to link to it from the VW Canvas page.  If

i will be happy to take pictures of the pieces, the frame-work, the 
tent, and my dog for anyone that wants to post it on a web page.

BUT i can't provide anything in a scanned electronic format so i will just 
send you the pictures and some narrative.  any takers?

send me your snail mail address if you want to do this for the 
collective good.  probably only web site is necessary.  Joe?  David?  
Thom?  matters not to me.
