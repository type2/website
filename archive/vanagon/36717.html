I'm confused.....why would VW bring back the Vanagon, considering it has 
been out of production in Germany since late 1989...considering the 16valve 
engine does not have the desired characteristics (low end torque) for a van 
engine...that the T4 has already sold &gt;1 million units, etc..etc..

I wish people would get it thru their heads that the T4 is a great design 
that it is VWUS Marketing Department's act of Coppulating Vertically that it 
was not the sales success here in the US that it is in the rest of VWs world 
market.

Oh well..I guess I'm cranky...
