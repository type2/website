&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If anyone knows a source for the right spring, please let us know.
&gt; 
&gt; Bob, can you describe where this spring attaches?  Either I didn't see the
&gt; pring that looks similar to one for a retractible pen or mine is missing.  I
&gt; really would like to get the doors to operate as God and VW intended!  
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the springs I've seen on my excursions through the door mechanism are
&gt; the tiff wire spring that is at the back of the lock barrel, the coil spring
&gt; (i think) that rests against the push button, and  what I would describe as
&gt; a clck type spring that you see when the inner door panel is removed.
&gt; Should there be an additional spring somewhere else?

I'm writing from memory here, because it has been a couple of years
since I had to fix one of these.

There is (was) a small spring that hooks in a small hole in a lever
that is mounted in the up-down plane. The other end of the spring
fastens to the mechanism housing. The moveable end of the lever gets
stuck if the spring is missing or broken. You can coerce it out of the
way by pounding on the door above the handle, or you can replace the
spring.  To replace the spring, the lock mechanism must be removed
from the door--not a fun task. That's why I've lived with the problem
for over a year on one of my doors even though I know I can fix it.

Maybe I'll get to it this weekend and post better instructions on the
fix next week.

Long live your '71! -- the best VW bus ever built!
