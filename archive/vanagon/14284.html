Yes, its a lot simpler, and maybe safer?

&gt; regulator back to the tank and whala! you are done, to boot you can hang
&gt; a K&amp;N performance conical filter ($50 or so) anywhere there is room.
&gt; My question is now about the Dasher exhaust manifold. Why? why not the
&gt; stocker, the dashers never had O2 sensors did they, I thougt they were
&gt; K-Jetronic with no feedback only. If not what's the gain.  The Digifant

Its the Dasher manifold that goes 4 into 2 into 1. Its supposed to flow
better, and you just have to drill a hole then weld in the O2 sensor. I
still have the stock diesel exhaust manifold which had to be drilled for
the sensor.

&gt; idea also removes the warm up regulator routing for the K KE system,
&gt; another great plus. My only further concern is cost, a mechanicla lifter
&gt; GTI with all the fixins would run you at least $500 less around here,
&gt; junkyards typically know the value of the knock sensor ignition
&gt; components, etc.

I got my '92 Jetta engine, 30,000 km, for Can$1100. It is in very good
condition. I almost went for a 1800 twin camm, but it was Can$1400, and
would have entailed more bodywork. Besides, I think that the single cam is
more reliable, (at least its not an interference engine).

  Makes me want to run out right now and buy a diesel

I think its not a bad way to go. Often diesels are owned by a certain type
of individual...persnickety, certainly &quot;machine oriented&quot;. My theory is
that they are more likely to be in better condition than gas powered versions.

&gt; Vanagon if I could find one.  Of course it should be noted the Digifant
&gt; cars are rarer in general as well, from '89 up only I believe, I tell
&gt; you though them cross flow 2.0 liters, somebody should look into that,
&gt; the intake manifold would then come in on the passenger side where room
&gt; is plentiful although clearance with the engine cover could be
&gt; questionable, but when I last looked at a Jetta III seemed it wrapped up
&gt; pretty tight over the valve cover, of course also working against you is
&gt; the fact that new block is a little taller.

I've looked at them with envy. But they are very expensive. I think you
can do much with the 1800 single cam to boost the performance at a
reasonable cost. I do think that they have it all over the wasserboxers
for ease and cost of repair.

&gt; is the new 1.9 liter diesel rated for.  Seems you could have the best of
&gt; both worlds if it was good for 75 hp or so, reasonable acceleration
&gt; approaching a Wasserboxer while keeping the mileage.
&gt; 
The tdi diesel is the ultimate motor for the vanagon, if only...

Alistair

p.s. I didn't notice any handicap not having pre-heated intake air this
winter, but it wasn't that cold .
