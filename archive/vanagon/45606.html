Jim, 

I am ready to order some parts from you if you can please give me some
prices.  All will be put on a '79 front axle beam I will be installing in my
'73 Westy.  I plan on switching steering knuckles to keep the '73 knuckles.
It is my understanding that VW switched caliper types between the two years,
and I don't want to confuse the situation any more than necessary.  Please
let me know if an incompatibility is about to hit me up side my head.

I need:

1 pr KYB KG4521 Front Gas-A-Just  (Price still 34.95ea?)
1 relay arm rebuild kit  (include shaft or are these just the bushings?)
1 center tie rod (from steering box to relay arm)
1 left side tie rod (the non-adjustable one)
R&amp;L ends for the right side tie rod.

If there is a way to get away with ends only on the center and left rods,
let me know.  I will forward a CC # on reciept of prices.  In addition to
the parts, I would like to get these by the 3rd, as I plan to install them
on the 4th/5th, so a quote on UPS next-day would also be welcome.

                           H Steven Dolan
