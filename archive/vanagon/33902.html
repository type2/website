Subject: Re: 62 dust-caps (front)/Claw Hammer

The claw hammer is a nice tool to keep in your kit.  I had to start a Bus 
with one for a couple of months (arc across the terminals on the 
starter using the claw end).  Worked better than a screwdriver for solenoids 
with the raised plastic ridge.

&gt;         Ooooh, I just like to use the claw end of the hammer on the dust
&gt; cap.  One little POP! and it's off.  Maybe 2 POP!s sometimes, the second on
&gt; the opposite side.
