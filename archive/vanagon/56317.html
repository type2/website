Subject: fridge fan?
Date: Sat, 22 Feb 97 17:28:59 EST

Hey all,
I have a quick question.  I know that the efficiency of the Dometic
Westy fridge can be increased by installing a little fan inside the
fridge to blow over the fins.  I have heard of some folks getting a
teeny fan like this at Radio Shack.  

I went to Radio Shack today and looked at their fan selection.  The only
thing I could find that was close to what I heard about is a really
small (about the size of a little matchbox) fan that's sold as a CPU
cooling fan.  It runs on 12v DC and draws 0.9 amps.  I assume this is
the fan that is referred to?  Does this fan flow enough air to do the
job?  How would one go about mounting this fan and running the wiring? 

I have seen a fan sold specifically for this purpose, it's made by an RV
products manufacturer and sits in the bottom of the fridge and blows air
up.  I've never seen it in person but I know it exists, I saw it on the
packaging of a water tank filler.  Does anyone know where I could find
this fan?

I'm interested in doing this because of my upcoming camping trip.  I'm
gonna have some perishable stuff in the fridge and I want to make sure I
don't have any spoilage problems.  The fridge itself works fine, I just
want to make it work better.

Thanks,
Sean
