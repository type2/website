Yeah... that the problem with Netcom... no WWW site for the users.  
It's almost impossible to get onto the FTP server.  So, one of the 
benefits of having a Netcom account is that you can access these files 
directly.

Netcom people with shell accounts can access it more easily with lynx with: 
lynx file://localhost/ftp/pub/tf/tfab/bus_pix.html

Or people using slirp and Netscape can use the following URL:
file://[username]_at_netcom20_dot_netcom_dot_com/ftp/pub/tf/tfab/bus_pix.html
Where username is your username, you will be prompted for your password, 
and logged in as as yourself.  I used Netcom20 because netcom_dot_com goes to 
netcom1, and is always overloaded.
DO NOT try this using ftp_dot_netcom_dot_com, your password and username will be
recorded in the FTP logs if try to use the FTP server. 

For all you people that don't have Netcom shell accounts... sorry.

Bradley
