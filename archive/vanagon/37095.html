f anyone had a lead on the warm air duct connecting to
the heater box on the Vanagon since I couldn't locate one locally. I tried
Parts Place and some others without result as well. Today while ordering a
pop top seal from BusBoys I asked about one as an after thought since they
don't list one in their catalog. Damned if they didn't have it for around
$10! 

Aside from my delight at finding one, I was surprised to find something
related to the Vanagon other than the list stickers  that cost $10 or less.
