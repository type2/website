Subject: Re:stalling problem

Another fact we lived with..like the window noise! Actually putting in the
preheat hose solved it in wintertime...and replacing the idling jet also
seemed to help. We also found our butterfly valve was badly worn...eventually
we put on another carb and now it runs perfect! (single port 1600)
However my beetle is a ****** for doing this sporadically, I just had to learn
how to toe and heel the gas and brake pedals!
