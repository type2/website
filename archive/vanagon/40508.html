&gt;I remember some Syncro owners mentioning that their distributors were
&gt;water-sealed with some sort of a gasket or rubber boot - the one in my '89
&gt;is *not*, and I bet Fred's isn't either. 
&gt;
&gt;Did this change on '90-'91 Syncros?  If so, I wonder which one(s) he got
&gt;quoted on?

The only &quot;boot&quot; or &quot;gasket&quot; I've seen on a Syncro distributer is kind of a
rubber &quot;sock&quot; that goes over the top after the cap &amp; wires are attached.  It
looked like it would reduce the likelyhood of water splashes contacting the
distributer &amp; could be added over any similar sized distributer, Syncro or
not.  Certainly a seperate part - not part of the distributer.
