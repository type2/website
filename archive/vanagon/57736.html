Referencing page 97.138 in the Bentley and looking in our own 85 GL I see
no evidence of either a high or low pressure switch. It would be a very
simple mater to attach gauges and verify.

&gt;For the longest time I thought I had no freon in my AC system.

&gt; My mechanic tells me that if I had no freon, my compressor would not

&gt;Can anyone shed some light?
