&gt; 
&gt; &gt;in the new, November 1995 issue of Automobile magazine, they have an
&gt; &gt;article about some snow tires ... and one particularly interesting
&gt; &gt;tire is the Bridgestone Blizzak WS-15. here's some test results:
&gt; 
&gt; One of the TV stations in either Minneapolis or St. Paul (KARE, KSTP or WCCO)
&gt; did a story on the Blizark WS-15.  This is important around here since we've
&gt; already had snow (last week)!  They said that the reason these tires are so
&gt; good is the very soft compound they're made off.  The soft compound also
&gt; means that they don't last too long.  They also said 10,000 miles would be
&gt; about the most you could get on them.  You do not want to use them on dry
&gt; pavement!

Hi all

My $.02...  I've heard the same of the Blizzaks.  For me, I use the
Nokia Hakka's.  I've used them on my Jetta and on my Acura, and I've
had nothing but great experiences with them.
