Subject:       Re: CO Adjustment

Donald asks:
&gt; So I have been experimenting with turning the CO adjustment screw
&gt; counter-clockwise.  My first attempt was to make a full turn of the screw.
&gt; This seems to have resulted in no deleterious effects to the running of the
&gt; engine.  Should I keep turning?

On your '85 you will probably be able to twidle that screw in and out 
all day long without noticing much effect... seems to be a function 
of high miles on the engine and an aging air flow meter.  but don't 
run out and replace the air flow meter, i did on mine and it matter 
not a whit.  :(  The dealer here in Bemidji just laughs when I ask 
about adjusting the darn thing, he hasn't found that CO screw to be 
very effective on the wasserboxers.

if you have a digital VOM, try setting the CO to give you .5 volts on 
the O2 sensor (search earlier posts regarding this)
