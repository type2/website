Subject: LA Contact

        At Christmas, my familiy and I visited the LA area. One of the
things we did was buy some things at Euro-American. While there, the owner
indicated that he was in the process of manufacturing mud flaps for the
Vanagon. Could I ask one of you to call him at 818-716-4214 and see what the
status is?
        Thanks.
