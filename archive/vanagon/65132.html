Subject:      Re: Hot VW's artical

Is there any really anything different about these magazines compare to say
Road and Track?  These Magazines cater to Junk parts suppliers. The other
cater to Junk Car suppliers!!  Both want your money while trying to offer as
little value as they think they can get away with.  But lets not forget that
most of us enjoy these mags and as intelligent people, we should take each
article for what it is worth to us.

My 2cents.

Dennis
