Hi,
	Despite recent posts recommending that people not do this, I have
a severe space problem in my garage and I have no place to store the
seats that I recently replaced in my 73 camper.  They are black, and in
fair condition, and are the shortback vinyl standard bus seats.  If anyone
wants them, I can bring them to the January camping trip, but please let
me know soon, cause I want to dump them this weekend!

Thanks,
	-David
