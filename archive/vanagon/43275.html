In a message dated 96-05-29 20:40:43 EDT, you write:

&gt;  Gene Berg instructions say to NEVER use Teflon tape on the senders. 
&gt;     Don't recall the reason, whether it will contaminate the oil or just 
&gt;     because with tape it would be easy to overtighten and possibly split 
&gt;     the hole.

I believe the reason for this is that the sender requires metal-to-metal
contact to provide a proper path to ground.
