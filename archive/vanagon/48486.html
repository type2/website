Subject: Re: ABS on your 1991 Vanagon??

&gt;Percent of consumers who &quot;believe&quot; they have ABS on their 1991 
&gt;model-year vehicles -- but do NOT
&gt;
&gt;TRUCKS:
&gt;Volkswagen Vanagon 92%

C'mon Harry, 92% of us KNOW that you can't lock the brakes anyway, it's a
vanagon design feature isn't it?  Or is it those cardboard brakes shoes I
got for $3.99 at Crappy Tire?  :)   tim smith
