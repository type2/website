Subject: Re: Self-Introduction

Sami Dakhlia inquires about my Porsche engine collection.  The 71 is still
for sale, for $1500.  The 77 has one cylinder with either bad rings or bad
valve seals.  I'm going to fix it, as I believe it may be a better engine
than the one in the Targa.  The 79 is the first I've had to pay true value
for: the 71 was half in a basket, and the 77's nobody seems to want.  The
79 is what all the 2.7 liter (74-77) people want to move up to, and I have
to admit that 3.0 liters pulls stronger than 2.7 did, even before 2.7 
started running on 5 1/2 cylinders.

Mug a Porsche; your Vanagon WANTS that engine.  Even the &quot;little&quot; 2.2 liter
six is so much happier between 3000 and 5000 rpm than the four cylinder
that it just transforms the van.
