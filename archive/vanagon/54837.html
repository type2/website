Subject: '70s (?) bus: Newcomer's Question

A question from a VW beginner looking to get started in this hobby:

A neighbor of mine back home has owned a Bus ever since I can remember.
It's a non-Westy, white top (ending just below the windows) and green
sides; since I can't identify Buses yet by year, other than early/late, I
can only tell you that this one has the turn signal lights above the
headlights rather than below. From that, I think it's a later-model one.
He rarely drives it, and it has basically been turning into a big blocky
snowdrift the entire winter. 

It has a faded bluish-white rectangle on the back window which once was a 
bumper sticker reading &quot;Beam Me Up Scotty - No Intelligent Life Down 
Here!&quot; :) Faded now, but I remember it well from my childhood.

I don't know what its condition is other than &quot;driveable&quot; -- I've seen it
going up and down the street a few times (rarely), but the body panels are
rusting in many places and the &quot;VW&quot; on the front is missing. I've half a
mind to make him an offer for it.  I've heard of Buses in much worse
condition being successfully restored, and I've got $500 coming my way. 

Opinions: should I pursue it? Shouldn't I? And what do you think the 
prospects are of restoring it, if I have help?
