&gt;&gt;&gt; Amen.  I come to the Vanagon list to GET AWAY FROM COMPUTERS!  You
&gt;&gt;&gt; can only handle eating sleeping breating fixing troubleshooting
&gt;&gt;&gt; networking rebuilding computers for so long and then you need a VW
&gt;&gt;&gt; break.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You came to the wrong place to get away form computers...
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, geez.  You have a van!  Drive out to the country and eat some 
peaches!

Buses also make great places to practice musical instruments without
annoying your neighbors. Lift out the center seat, and anything from
a French horn to a bari sax will fit. Bass trombones may need a walk-thru.
 You lucky ragtop dudes can even do tubas and bassoons-- just head out
to a lonely remote area and terrify the bunnies for a while.
