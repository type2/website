Subject: I Bought the '85 Vanagon!!!!
Date: Thu, 10 Nov 1994 16:46:50 -0800 (PST)

I did it!  I got the 1985 Vanagon today, left the Passat at work and 
drove it home this evening.  Thanks to everyone who responded to my 
queries about this vehicle.

A couple of issues:

I need an owner's manual!  I called around to a couple of the VW dealers 
here in Metropolitan Atlanta and had no luck.  Jim Ellis said they could 
order one but were not encouraging, if they could find one it could take 
months to show up according the parts person.  Is there some kind soul in 
the Atlanta area that could lend me theirs for the purpose of 
photocopying?

I am planning on changing the oil, filter and flushing the cooling system 
soon.  There appears to be no visible coolant in the expansion tank (blue 
or otherwise) but it does not appear to be leaking either.  What sort of 
flushing compund is recommended (if any) and must I use that expensive 
stuff from the VW dealer or are there other Phosphate-free substitutes 
available?  Also, since I don't have any specs on this car, how much does 
it hold?  How much oil, for that matter?

Speed three doesn't work on the front heater/fresh air fan, the other 
speeds work if I jiggle the switch.  Is this a Vanagon only switch, or 
can I buy similar from Jetta/Golf?

I may have let myself in for a real pain here, but I'm sure I will learn 
a lot (I did find out where the brake fluid reservoir is--what a 
surprise!!! quite by accident).  I suppose I should get a service manual 
for the thing but Bentley is really expensive--will Haynes do?

What I really need is the grand tour of this thing--any takers in Atlanta?--
