On the busses I have owned
	69 T2
	70 Camper
	71 7 pass T2
	72 Camper
	74 7 pass
	83 diesel V. (the only warm one!)

all of my CV trouble has occured in the outer joints, usually on the
right side. The inner joints showed wear, but the noise always come from the
outer ones first.

its six data points only but FWIW
