&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I've recently noticed ('78, 2.0L) what seems to be oil appearing on the
&gt;cooling air duct around the spark plug seal on the #3 cylinder.  It
&gt;seems to be coming out from under the seal and is running toward the
&gt;front of the bus.  It's not a gusher or anything, just enough to leave a
&gt;small film on the duct.  

The oil is probably coming from the crank seal behind the cooling fan.
