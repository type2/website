&gt;          Complete rebuilt and warranteed axles,( both CVs etc,) for my '87 
&gt; Syncro are $141 CDN, (ie $100US) so you should do some checking. It is way 
&gt; cheaper to buy a rebuilt axle than to buy a dealer priced single joint and 
&gt; do all the labour and end up without a warranty. Same goes for my ex-Honda!
&gt;   tim s.
&gt; 
Where are you finding complete axles rebuilt for $100 US, the best I
could ever find was remanufactured joints for $45 each, were these
remanufactured with new OEM joints? if so share your source.
