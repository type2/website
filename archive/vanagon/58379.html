Subject: Generic O2 Sensor Question
Date: Mon, 14 Apr 1997 11:54:03 -0500

I just received my new Bosch O2 Sensor. There are three wires one black,
and two white, my question is are the two white wires interchangeable with
each other? I see no way to distinguish the two as to where they go and I
don't want to burn anything up,

Thanks to all
