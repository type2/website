Subject: Engine Rebuild

Does anyone know where I can get an Engine rebuild kit for a 86 vanagon?
also I keep reading about people putting different engines into their
vans,....which alternate engines would fit into the 86 Vanagon and what
type of work would be involved in doing so.
	I'm thinking of picking up an 80 aircooled vanagon.  Can anyone tell me
if I can convert it to auto trans.  What problems did the 80 model have
that I should look out for?
                                              
						Thank You,
						    B.
