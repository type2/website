Subject: 83 Westy Trans. Trouble

Please--I need some advice. I just bought a nice '83 Westy with a rebuilt
water-cooled engine. (My first Westy). It has a bearing noise in the trans. I
took it to the dealer (Trend Motors in NJ) who said the main shaft bearing
was probably bad for a while and that contaminated the trans. fluid.
Therefore, he said, the whole trans was shot. Not even rebuildable, all as a
result of the contaminated fluid. Apparently the mechanic theorised this as a
result of pressure tests and the condition of the fluid. The trans has not
been removed. Does anyone with more experience than me know if this sounds
right? And if it does sound right, what are my options as far as a possible
catalogue order rebuild to install myself. (I'm a fairly adept backyard
mechanic who has done frame up restorations on American makes) Because I
haven't got the $2,600 the dealer wants for the job. Any advice would be
greatly appreciated. Thank you. Thank You.
