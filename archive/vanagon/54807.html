Subject: Re: Shifting, No Clutch

&gt; Question-Does anyone have personal experience or can advise of the 
&gt; damage, if any, that may be incurred by shifting without using the 
&gt; clutch?  This is the second time in my life I have had to limp home 
&gt; without a clutch (first was with an old Mustang).  
&gt; 
&gt; And to concur with what an earlier listmember posted, the slave 
&gt; cylinder failed 200 miles after the master cylinder failed (luckily in 
&gt; my driveway). Probably would have replaced both had I known it happens 
&gt; in pairs, the slave was pretty easy to replace. 
&gt; 
I drove my old Audi Fox over a week with a clutch the barely 
disengaged. During this time, I practiced shifting with no clutch to 
prepare for eventual total failure. It was actually quite easy - just 
shift slowly, attempting to match rpm before hitting the next gear. 
In the Audi, if your off by &gt;100 rpm or so, it would not engage, so 
it meant carefully easing off or on the gas, while gently pushing 
into next gear. After practice, only 1 in 10 shifts would result in 
any gear clash at all...
The key is gentle pressure. I would say that jamming it into the next 
gear would definitely do damage though...
