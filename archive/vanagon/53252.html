Subject: Re: 97 EV's

&gt;  Hi EV Scouts:
&gt; 
&gt; I visited the VW dealer today for routine maintenance and spoke to the
&gt; service manager. He has just received repair manuals for the '97 EV and
&gt; he thinks this is a clear sign that they will be imported soon, probably
&gt; in the spring. HOWEVER....he did some digging and discovered that in the
&gt; States only the automatic transmission will be available on them. It's
&gt; in Canada, where the '97's will have a 5-cyliner turbo diesel option, that
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    
Yahoo!! About time VW brought back the diesel van (in Canada). I wonder when 
Chr*sler will &quot;invent&quot; this one? ;)
