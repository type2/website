Subject:      EVC help

Thanks to Everyone,

By Friday I should be doing Eurobago-ing to Lee, ME for a test.  Thanks for
all the help, everyone, especially Chris and Ric.  Dealer gives me a TWO
HOUR test of all equipment Friday at 1300 so I'm getting excited.  Oop's,
just dropped my little piggy-bank!!

Anyone still interested in the files on '97 EVC's should 'lemme know because
they're pretty good.  Richard Cochran's write up is going with me on the
equipment test.

Gary from Maine
