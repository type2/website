Hey all,
I got my Fridge Mate Fan today from Camping World!  I know, it's not
that neat but I'm easily amused :-) .

Thanks to Ron Lussier for the info that CW does mail order and for
giving me their phone number and the fridge mate fan part number.  I
didn't realize they were in Kentucky.  I ordered it Monday and was
surprised to have it arrive today.  It's a neat little doohickey, but I
don't know if it's worth $15.  It's made in Mexico and looks to be made
of fairly cheap materials so I know they're making a HUGE profit on
these puppies :-) .  But if it helps the food stay fresh, I'll be happy.

Sean
