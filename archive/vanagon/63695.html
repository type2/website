Hi Mikey
 
The alternator and regualtor can be treated as one.  If there's a problem
an autoelectrician is needed to fix it ( unless you are skilled enough to
fix electrical or mechanical problems). BTW check the &quot;fan&quot; belt tension, a
frequent cause of poor charging particularly when the belt is not being
used to drive a radiator cooling fan or water pump and its tension
overlooked.

With a new fully charged battery (the serviceman misdiagnosed an alternator
problem as being a kaput battery) , I drove  over 300 miles in daylight
without an alternator from Armidale to Sydney  in New South Wales.  I used
the minimum of electrical accesories and only stopped twice.  I had a
second charged battery as a standby but it was not required.  I was driving
a Toyota Corona not a Vanagon but I'd think the current drain from the coil
and other vital electricals are similar.

Best of luck
