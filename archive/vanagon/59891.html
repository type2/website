Hi Thomas,  

This is the answer from SDP for the selectable 4WD parts.  I have written
back explaining that VW/USA, VW/ZudAfrica and 300 Syncro owners worldwide have 
been unable to provide any information.  

Bye, Tim

Did you try to get in contact with Frank Libourius, I gave you the phone 
number / fax in one of my last mails. ?

The problem is not that SDP don't want to sell parts they are simply not 
allowed because of their contracts to VW 

Bye, Tom
