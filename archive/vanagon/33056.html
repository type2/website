     I found something similar.  Transmitting on the 2 meter ham band I 
     could double the rate that my turn signal blinked.

I have found that transmitting a signal on the CB radio typically sets off 
the little red oil warning lamp befoe the driver in late model Vanagons. Not 
to be afraid, its just the CB; took me a few times to get the correlation.
