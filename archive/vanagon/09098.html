&gt;there's something in the back of my mind that says the bolt pattern
&gt;on the torsion arms where the reduction boxes bolt up may be
&gt;different on split case trannies v. tunnel case trannies reduction
&gt;boxes, you might want to check this out before going further.

Nope, they are exactly the same pattern.  What is different is inside,
like the axles, or the fact that you have to take the damn tranny
apart to tget them out!
