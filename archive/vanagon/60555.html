Hi Eurovaners:

I've seen from the archives that I'm not the only one to have funky fuel &amp;
temperature indications.  From what I read, it appears a little re-soldering
on
the back of the instrument panel can solve the problem.  Can anyone tell me
if
there is already a posting on the procedure for removing the instrument
cluster
and where to fix the circuit?  Thanks,

Maynard Southard

My gages act strange sometimes too. I have not seen any posting about the
exact procedure but have one in mind:
1. disconnect the ground cable from battery.
2. Remove the steering wheel.
3. Remove the cover from the instruments
4. from under the dash disconnect the speedo cable.
5. remove the instrument cluster (take care to disconnect the cable)
6. solder any connection that looks bad but be sure you look at the ones for
the voltage stabiliser. 

If you are not good at soldering have someone else do it. Do not fry
anything. I have not actually done this but will be doing it in the next 30
days. I will get back to you after I do. Do this stuff at your own risk.

Don, thanks for procedure.  I am waiting for a copy of THE EUROVAN UPDATE
promised to me by another listee that apparently also has a procedure.  I will
post my encounter as soon as I give it a go.  Thanks for responding.

... Maynard
