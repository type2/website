 I am somewhat familiar (second hand) with this kind of swap, but are
you sure the Vanagon is a 1984?  I am only aware of 1982 &amp; 1983's being
imported into N.America, although diesels were available in Europe all
along.  The 1983 5 speed tranny is not as good a match for the gas
engine as the 1982 4 speed tranny.  LiMBO's Jim Digennaro has a van with
this kind of engine swap.
