Subject: Brown Pass. Door Wanted

Just dented my front passenger door on a pole that was below visible level 
when backing out of a parking spot.  :(
I have a used door in another color, but before I pay a body shop $150 to 
paint it, I thought I'd ask if anyone knows of one for sale that's already 
the right color.  (Sure would be easier!)  Color is Merion Brown (the dark 
brown used around 1985).
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
