Subject: Re: CV Joints 80 Vanagon

&gt;-- [ From: Mark Howser * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --
&gt;
&gt;I've got a rattling noise on the right rear of my van.  It occurs when I'm
&gt;moving, especially when I get close to upshifting to the next gear.  I
&gt;checked the outside CV boot on the right rear of my van.  It was torn.  I
&gt;jacked up the rear end and there seem to be a  play in the wheel.  
&gt;
&gt;Question:   Is this a failing CV joint?  What else can I do to confirm
&gt;that's what it is?
&gt;
&gt;If it is failing, what is inviolved in replacing it?  What tools will I need
&gt;?
&gt;
&gt;I priced a CV joint at my FLAPS and it was $108.  Is that reasonable? 
&gt;Should I avoid any suppliers/manufacturers?
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
&gt;

Mark,

Try Transform at 800-508-7267.  They do quality VW tranny rebuilds and carry
lots of drivetrain parts.

I bought four German &quot;Racing&quot; CV joints from them for $50 each.  I would
also suggest replacing the boots with German-made units.  The German-made
boots seem to last several times as long as the ones made in India, Mexico,
Brasil, etc.
