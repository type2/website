Subject: Re: Another battery question...


&gt;The auto battery is rated at 0 degrees F.  the marine battery is rated
&gt;at 70 degrees F.


Here in Sunny Californy, most auto batteries are rated at 32F rather than
0F, since most large cities here never see 0 (or 32, for that matter).
So, the 1000 CCA battery we buy here, is the same one you minnesotans
buy that says 875 CCA on it. Uff da.
