&lt;&lt; Hmmm
 As the original asker ...
 It is a camper AND 
 it has a little doorjamb like button AND
 I just turn the handle to release the brake.
 
 So why have the button? Can't be just to check the light?
 Or is it broken and I'm suppose to push it to release the brake?
  &gt;&gt;

In a ''68-'79 bus, when you turn the parking brakelever to release it, the
lever retracts back towards the dash and squashes down that little botton and
your beake light goes off. 

you don't need to push the little button with your finger, tho I guess it can
be amusing for some to watch that little red light go on and off...  :&lt;)
