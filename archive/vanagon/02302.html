Subject: Sources for replacement mufflers
Date: Tue, 26 Jul 94 14:25:28 EDT

Hello Folks,

I'm on my third Vanagon, but this is the first time I've had to replace
a muffler.  The dealer (the same one I got the CHEAP temperature sensor
from) quoted me $421 for the muffler and $86 for the tail pipe.  AND
a lifetime guarantee is included for no additional charge ...

Are these prices typical for VW replacement parts?  Needless to say, I'd
be most appreciative for any suggestions on alternative sources.
