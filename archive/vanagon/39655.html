Subject: Re: Friday--A cool VW ad...

&gt; ..Maybe I don't get enough sleep, but I have what I think is a cool TV
&gt; ad for a Vanagon (or would've been, anyway).
&gt;
&gt; Shot of a busy highway. Lots 'o cars driving it. Cut to a Vanagon on the
&gt; highway. The Vanagon people are happy (of course). They're coming up the
&gt; highway approaching heavy traffic. Cut to various shots of people in
&gt; other cars who are hot, tired, unhappy, etc.
&gt; Cut back to the van driver. He just shifts into 4rth and cruises on,
&gt; seemingly right into the traffic jam. But then we cut to an outside
&gt; aerial view. The van is now on its own road (that essentially just
&gt; appeared), branching off away from the jam-packed highway off into the
&gt; sunset (or sunny skies anyway). Just cruisin' along.
Or how about this:
 aerial shot of the bus, a camper, in a traffic jam. Everyone else is screaming
and cussing, but inside the bus, the folks have folded out the table, and are
having a pleasant dinner. that would be cool indeed. The caption could be:
Volkswagen campers- you're _never_ late coming home for dinner!
