&gt;We have had two Westy's, and are currently on our third.  In the first one,
&gt;I made curtains out of heavy material (light colored) that didn't let the
&gt;light through.  In no time, they were faded and looked awful.  The second
&gt;Westy had factory curtains that let too much light in.  The material was
&gt;great, never seemed to fade, but you could see in at night.  So I took them
&gt;down and lined them with a darker, same shade cotton. Not only did it give
&gt;us complete privacy at night, but the curtains actually looked like they
&gt;were made of higher quality material. I am currently doing the same for our
&gt;new ('86) Syncro.  It's a bit of work to take down the factory rods, but the
&gt;result is worth the effort.  The factory material (at least in the older
&gt;models) wears like iron, and it may be worth your while to try to find
&gt;curtains out of a wrecked VW Camper.
