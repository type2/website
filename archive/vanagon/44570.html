Subject: Bob Hoover held incommunicado by crashed disk

Relayed by a couple of phone calls, I learned that Bob Hoover's laptop has
let him down.  Something to do with the FAT file on his hard disk.  So, until
further notice he will not be receiving or sending mail -- so please don't
send him any (we don't want to fill up AOL's mail file).  He will let the
list know when he is back online.

Other than that, he is alive and well in New Mexico.  He had a couple of
adventures that only Bob could have, and only Bob could describe -- so we'll
have to wait to hear about him towing _another_ (broken) VW bus across the
Mojave.

Peace,

-Roland
