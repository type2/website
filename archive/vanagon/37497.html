&gt;Get a 50cc syringe from a vet or pharmacy, level the head and do a rough

        Ok, when measuring chamber volume, how do I plug up the spark plug
hole? I don't have any old sparkplugs laying around at the moment. Also, I
need the formulae, I've never done this before.

        Don't know if you saw my general post earlier today about the used
oil coolers. The local yard wants $60 for a complete doghouse setup-but
it's all used, including the cooler. New ones seem to run around $90, ouch.
Do you think I'm better off with a used doghouse? Or should I stick with
the upright? I don't know what condition my cooler is in, when I pull the
engine if I find it trashed then I'll obviously want to go with a doghouse.
The cash thing is a drag though. Brought up the possibility of a doghouse
to the wife, she had a fit about how much money these things cost. She's
obviously got her head where the sun don't shine if she thinks she can get
a new car for these kinds of prices, but how does one reason with
unreasonable emotion? Been thinking about making a nice calculation of how
much all of this has cost since day 1, but I doubt it would do anything
more than antagonize. Until she has AC and a smooth-as-silk-ride I guess
I'll just have to deal with it. Sorry for venting at you...

Peace,
