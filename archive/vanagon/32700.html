Subject: RE: Getting hubs off a '62


&gt;Anyone know offhand what size socket I need to get the hubs off my '62?

46 mm, since I think you mean a bus, right? Bugs are 36 mm.

There are inch-and-a fraction equivalents to this. I have one for my bus,
abd I believe it's 1-13/16.  Sears has them for around $23, but if you shop
around at tool places, you can get cheapos for as little as $9. If you're 
not
a proessional mechanic using it every day, it'll probably last longer than
you will.  :^)
