Subject: '71 westy features?

Good morning!
 This is the first in what will probably be a long series of questions. 
:) 
I finally bought that camper that I've been driving by forever, and am 
currently trying to puzzle out some of the interior. A few particulars:
1) the icebox is just that, correct? put some ice in and go? The reason
I wanted to check is because of the electrical outlets on the other side. 
I don't know where you would fit all of the parts necessary for an actual
refridge, but then again, after trying to replace one of the bulbs in the
dash, I can see how vw would try to wedge them in. :)
2) how does the sink get its water supply? I see two pipes coming out of 
the floor, one is obviously the drain (I poured some warm beer down it), 
i assume the other is water hookup, but it is too bashed up on the end
to tell. :( Is there some sort of pump assembly to get the water up to 
the faucet? Is there a water tank that you can fill up or something? I am 
clueless, but I sure am having a good time trying to 
figure this crap out...(anybody know where to get a spigot, too?)
3) as far as the outside electrical hookup, I plan on taking a look 
at it (i.e. rip it apart) before plugging anything in, but is there
any thing in particular that you folks have found that tends to screw
up that I should look for?
4) and finally, just wondering if anyone can recommend a good source for
replacement canvas and screens for the top.

Well, thank you very much folks. Good to be back online and speaking
volkswagen again. (Between crawling under the westy and remembering how
to work email again there hasn't been much time for anything else. :})

cya,
