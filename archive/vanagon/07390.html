Subject: 1980 Vanagon with a problem, HELP!!!

My housemate has a 1980 Vanagon.  He is blowing oil through his
muffler.  My assumption is a blown ring (at least one).  Any other
possbilities?   Any ways to assure of either this or a different
problem (without taking the engine out, taking the heads off, etc,
etc).

Here is another curiosity, which led me to discover the oil through
the muffler.  He was driving on the highway, doing about 65 when he
suddenly lost a lot of power, slowed him down to about 40.  In a
short span of time he was back up to 70, no problem.  This happened a
few times.  I at first assumed blown front seal and oil on the clutch
plate.  No oil on the ground, and then we noticed the oil coming from
the muffler.  I stuck my hand in front of it, and my hand was covered
in splotches of oil.

Any suggestions?   Clues?   Advice!

See my next post about house karma nd Volkswagens.  You'll love  it!
