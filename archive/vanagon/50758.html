&gt; Hmmm. You got me looking for this because my unix units program told me
&gt; something different, so I went looking.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks from all I can find that
&gt; 
&gt; 1 bar = 14.50377 psi
&gt; 14.69595 psi = 1 atm
&gt; 1 atm = 1.013250 bar
&gt; 
&gt; Something is clearly wrong here, but it seems terribly consistent to the
&gt; conversion program I have.
&gt; 
&gt; Where is this all wrong?  Is one bar really supposed to be 1 atm? Or am I just
&gt; full of hot air?

You where right and I was wrong: 1 Bar = 0.987 atmospheres (so much for
my PhD in physics). The problem is one of metric vs. non-metric worlds.
One Bar is 10**6 dyne/cm**2. It is used by the metric world as the
standard pressure at sea level. One atmosphere is also defined as the
standard pressure at sea level. Well we'll just have to wait ans sea.
