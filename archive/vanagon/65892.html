&lt;&lt; what about tapping off hot-air duct that runs to the front of the van from
the
 heater boxes, splicing in another duct that goes directly into the
 rear seat area?  come up thru the floor and put a vent in the rear seat
 wood work (this is a westy remember).  make the vent and splice be able to
be
 closed to isolate if no passengers.  maybe put a 12volt fan in line to pull
more
 heat thru?  i would think duct work from home supply stores would work
 nicely.  anybody ever try this?  it would entail cutting a hole in the floor
 but you have to do that if you install an aux. heater, right?

look at a van w/ a BA6 gas heater, and you'll see what to do..
