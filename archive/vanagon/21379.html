Subject: Gas Heater Help

Been off the list for a week!  Man, I miss this stuff.  Nothing major 
happened while I was gone I hope.  I traded the rear hatch off my '67 Bus 
for a Southwind gas heater out of a '67 Westy and now I need the 
assistance of the Vanagon-list-gas-heater-guru.  Where can I find manuals 
for this thing so I can *safely* use it in one of the older Busses. (I 
just love the heat in the '81 and recommend everyone who needs heat 
accessorize their Bus with one of these little miracles, except maybe you 
water-coolers).  Oh, my address is now different as the local library 
upgraded their systems this week (that's why I was &quot;gone&quot;).  Thanks for 
the help. :-)
