Subject: Re: calif campout &amp; lisa'a new motor

          1st - hey martha, you got any camp sites closer to
          florida???

          2nd - hey lisa in the land of the burning river, congrats on
          your new motor.  18 hours, eh?  we are in the process of
          beating that record on my '66 kombi.  if it actually fires
          tonight it'll be closer to 20 hours.  question: why don't
          these freaking parts i ordered fit properly??  nothing
          should ever have to go together with the help of a hammer,
          nothing.  and why does my body hurt everywhere?  yesterday
          my wife had to help me get out from under the bus and help
          me up!

          ray (hopefully soon to be as ecstatic as lisa)
