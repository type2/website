Jack, whats the principle behind this? I use EDTA
(ethylamine-diamine-tetra-acetic acid) at work in some buffer recipes. It
functions, in my applications, as a divalent cation chelator. In other
words, it binds ions like Ca+2, Mg+2. Its this property that is used in
the somewhat controversial arteriosclerosis treatment. The EDTA is
supposed to bind and solubilize the Ca+2 (calcium ions) in plaques.
The electrochemistry of the lead acid battery is well known, but not by me
right now! I forget what the valence state(s) of the sulfur/sulphate are.


Alistair, who is going to get the right textbook
