Subject: Re: Any good Camping sites near Santa Cruz/San Francisco?

&gt;	Have any list members camped in that area?  Can you recommend
&gt;a nice camping facility?  All I have is the AAA camping book, and
&gt;I'm not finding a whole lot in that area.

Hi Ron,

One place we *really* like is San Mateo County Campgrounds. Problem is,
it's about 8-10 miles in from the Coast, and may be off the beaten path for
you. Still it's just gorgeous. Tucked in amongst the Coastal Redwoods, with
some nice running streams, lot's of Banana Slugs, etc. We take our annual
nursery school campout there with hordes of screaming 3 and 4 year olds.
Not to worry though, we won't be there till next May.

If you're interested, it's directly East of Pescadero which in itself is
about 30(?) miles north of Santa Cruz on the coast. Let me know if you're
interested and I can hunt down more info for you, or perhaps others on the
list can pass along more info.

cheers,

Bren
