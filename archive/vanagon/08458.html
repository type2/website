Subject: Reverse Light Switch

Thanks for all the info on Smoke,
At least I have some ammo now for when they try to make me pay for their error.
Or was it mine for getting them to do a simple job?.. anyway..blah..

My reverse light is currently operated from a switch on the dash, I would like
to return the operation of the light to the gear stick as originally.
I have pottered through the Haynes manual, but cannot find the location of the
original switch. Nor by crawling around under my bus can I find it - but I enjoy
doing this anyway :)
Does anyone know the secret location of the switch on a '73 Kombi 1700?

Cheers
Carl
