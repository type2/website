&gt;&gt;While poking around at the engine on my '89 Westy I noticed a sort of
&gt;&gt;plug at the back of the power steering pump. The naked prongs of the plug
&gt;&gt;definitely looked as if something was supposed to be hooked up to them
&gt;&gt;and sure enough on closer inspection I found two dangling wires.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;One wire was red and white and the other was sort of white or yellowish.
&gt;&gt;Does anybody know which wire goes on top and bottom or does it matter ?
&gt;&gt;Also what function does this connection serve ? I've had no trouble with
&gt;&gt;the steering.

&gt;I believe it bumps up the idle a few ticks when steering is at full lock 
and
&gt;there is therefore increased load on the engine (pump's working hard).

Yes, it bumps up engine revolutions during idle, but every time when you
move the steering wheel. The wires are going to a switch.
