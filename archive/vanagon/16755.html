Subject: CV Grease

	Chris,
	CV Grease is available from good parts places, including
your friendly VW dealer, in big grease-gun tubes for about $6 or $10. 
One big tube and a bit more were needed for my Rabbit. Its good, serious 
grease, and you won't get the same results with high-temp wheel bearing 
grease. 

	Whenever you see stuff in little containers that you have to 
buy several of, its always worth your while to find the larger size you 
have to buy fewer of. Less packaging to dispose of/deal with, and you 
usually get a lower price too. The one thing I've liked about Wal-Mart
is you can buy gallon bottles of engine oil.

	What makes CV grease special is that, like tranny oil, it gets between
two metal surfaces as power is being transmitted between them. Wheel bearing
grease only carries the wieght of the car. If you think about it for
a second, all the horsepower of your engine passes THROUGH a thin
film of CV grease. I can't figure out how to calculate the power
going through wheel bearings- the load is static, so no 'work' is done,
but there ARE balanced forces. Given the final drive ratio and the
gear box ratios, you can calculate the torque going through the
axles and their CVs- note that all the torque appllied to an axle
goes through BOTH CVs- its not split, they're in series. It must
be several hundred foot-pounds in 1st, from a standing start.

	Hope this helps.
