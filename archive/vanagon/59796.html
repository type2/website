MANY thanks to Gerry for running the list!

Being a list member since mid of last year,
I learned a lot about Vanagons at their
owners. Without the list and its world-wide
knowledge I'm not able to convert my vehicle
in the way I did.

I like to pay my contribution for keeping
V_at_L alive on the net.
