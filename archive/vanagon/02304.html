&gt;Are these prices typical for VW replacement parts?  Needless to say, I'd
&gt;be most appreciative for any suggestions on alternative sources.

that's pretty close to what i was told: $520 for the muffler, $90 for the
tailpipe (by the local Satan-Worshipping Rip-off Scum Dodge-VW dealer).
i don't know why i even bother to call those clowns. i guess cause it makes
me feel sooooo good when i talk to the guys in atlanta. :)

anyway, Jim Ellis in atlanta sold me the muffler (with the lifetime guarantee)
for $300 and the tailpipe for $52. go figure.

also: find an ad for Borla exhausts (check European Car) and call them. the
fellow i talked to had an 84 vanagon and was considering making exhausts for
the vanagons. that was last year, so maybe he's finally gotten around to it.
their exhausts are stainless steel (and cheaper than the vw stuff!).
