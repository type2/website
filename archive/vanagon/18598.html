I have not really followed this but Parts Place
sent me their newest (blue) catalog this week and
I noticed they sell NEW '80-'83 for $350, as to the
maker, I don't know but it would be worth a call
because in my experience with them, it may take a
few tries to get the order right but they only sell
OEM or as good as OEM parts, at reasonable prices
and are quite pleasent about rectifying their mistakes.
BTW though I have heard equaly good things about
Steven's Machining's rebuild and since they are cheaper,
go for it.
