Subject: Re: just for kicks ... some more stats


Joel...if you REALLY wanted to put out some useful stats while
our list-fuhrer Gerry is away...howabout the annual list
of who has the most posts? Huh...huh...

Gerry's away...let's play!!  ;-)

This total of all busses mentioned on the internet, is well, boring..
what we want is real stats...the kind that have caused certain of
us to post and post and post...just to improve our positions on 
the list...of course some of it was done to drive Gerry crazy..
but that's another story for another day!


So come on Joel....spend some more of that Allybamah Tackspain'
Money...give us what we really want!!


Ric (where did I put that other quart of Cappio???)
