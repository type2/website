Subject:      My ex-westy's fridge

Hello from Vancouver Island;  I no longer have my nuch loved 75 westy,
however I do still have the fridge, the cabinet from the rear spare tire
cover, and the mosquito net that covers the back hatch opening when it's
open, and I have the remains of the westy tent  (or parts therof) if anyone
wants them contact me via E. I can guarentee good prices, like free to a
good home, but I'd rather not get involved in the expensive process of
shipping.  Oh, I forgot the rear table, and the little box with the
diabolical strap catch thing that my kids never could figure out how to
open.  Same price!       Larry Carter
