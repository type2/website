&gt; My wonderful mentor in things vanagon (Mark Johnson) says it's probably
&gt; the slave cylinder.  Does anyone else have ideas and also, where is a 
&gt; source for these things that won't force me not to eat for a while?

Before anything else, find the slave cylinder and examine closely for
leaking fluid, (on diesel vanagon trans, the clutch slave cyl is in the
lefthand side of the car, for what is worth). Anyway, when found, try
pulling the rubber boot off a bit. When the cylinder is worn and starts to
leak, fluid often collects in the boot before leaking out and down.
You may be lucky and only need the clutch bled, like you do with brakes.
This happened to me once, the clutch slowly needed more &quot;push down to the
floor&quot; to engage 1st and reverse. Bleeding the system brought it back to
normal and, miracles of miracles, it has stayed adjusted for the last year
or so. The fluid that was bled out was quite grotty, so I really flushed
the system well, bleeding the brakes too. It happened to me in the
wintertime also, although Victoria is NOT Red Deer, thank god :)
