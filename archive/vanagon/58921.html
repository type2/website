Saw this one in a used car lot in Auburn (near Sacto)

'81 Westi, P22 model, not the usual P27.  And that translates to
A Pop-top Wesfalia with sink but no stove or fridge, folding full 
width rear bench seat, two tables, HUGE water tank for sink use, 
small padded seat directly behind sink unit, tall storage in left rear.
81K on the odometer, slip covers over front seats, rear upholstery 
original, starting to get tattered.  Overall it looks like it has 81K 
on it with lots of down time.  Canvas in great shape.  Right head 
has oil leak, probably just cover.  Remember it's at a dealer, so 
price is probably high.  Anyway if interested call them, though I 
could go and look it over for ya!  No rust.  Dark brown paint.

They also rent vehicles, so the possibility exists that they might 
rent the Vanagon.  They have had some interest, but people are 
surprised by the lack of stove.  First time I've ever seen this 
model.

aside to Jim - 
This is a non-L model, so it still stands that the P22=non-L, P27=L.
Do you have a complete description of the differences, if not let me 
know, I'll fill in blanks.  Assuming someone doesn't buy it quickly.
