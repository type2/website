Subject: Re: NATO specs/Tires

&gt;In all seriousness, I'm curious as to what modifications are made to bring a
&gt;van up to NATO specs and how bullet proof tires are designed.  

It has a steering wheel for each occupant so everyone gets to drive, cuts 
down on the squabbling.  Also has 24V electrics so no one else can provide 
support for it. Bulletproof tires? Hah they just run them flat, bullets be 
damned, doesn't affect the overall performance a bit.  

Tim, whose $CDN taxes are feeding NATO coffers to keep genocidal maniacs 
from playing together. 


(but just to get you excited, weren't these units 4WD?)
