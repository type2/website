Subject: 88 Vanagon

Help!  I've just located an 88 in cherry condition.  Only 43,000 
original miles on it.  Air, extra set of tires, bra, am/fm/cassette, 
full camper stuff...very clean.  The guy is asking $19,000.  High book 
from what I can tell is $14,500.  

Three questions:
What should I realistically have to pay for this beauty?
All things being equal, is the auto trans any good?  Enough power?
Any caveats?
