Funny story about bike racks on back of Vans...

My way younger brother saved his money and bought a very 
nice ($$$) mountain bike. The first week he had it, the 
family (they who were still at home) went camping with the
bikes on the bike-rack on the back of Caravan. 

At the camp site, my old-man finished checking-in,
jumped in the nano-van (Compared to a Vanagon), and backed right
into a tree. This smashed the rear window, and bent my brothers
brand new bike. 

He turned around to the family in the caravan and yelled very
angrily and loudly

              &quot;DIDN'T ANYBODY SEE THAT TREE?&quot;

I hope, for *my* children's sake, I come up with something that can
top that someday.

p.s. I did break a finger 2 weeks ago having a &quot;jump off the swing the
farthest contest&quot; with my 12 year old. Still not as good though.
