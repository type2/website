Subject: first west coast trip


	Just wondering,  Looked throught the gopher and (addmittedly, I 
don't know it all that well) did not see any big report on the trip.  I 
did not check my mail during that time.  It was too hard for me to be in 
santa cruz knowing you were all down there having fun.  did it rain? 
still would be fun i imagine.  any way, if there was a report, could 
someon turn me on to it?  If not, then may I suggest?
