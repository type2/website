Subject: used VW parts sold by nice guy in Ga. Save this posting

Anyone who is interested in getting some inexpensive used parts for their
VW/Audi should give my friend Bill Todd a call.  Bill todd has filled his
back yard (roughly 2 acres) with all kinds of derelict VWs in various states
of disassembly just in case anyone needs something.  Bill UPSes parts out
daily to anywhere in the US and gets the right part the first time.  I have
bought many parts from Bill and have been pleased with the things that he
sends.  He has no computer, so therefore, no e-mail address.  simply call
(912) 352-7051.  He's in Savannah, Ga. and ask him for the part(s) that you
need or leave him a message if he's not there.
