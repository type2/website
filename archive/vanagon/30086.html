Subject: Argh! My transmission went kaput!

Hi folks,

Here's another update on my transmission repair. Took the gear stacks 
apart over the weekend. One whole segment of the 3rd/4th synchronizer hub 
had broken off. As I understand it, this is the Achilles heel of the 
4-speed 091/1 and is a common failure. The only other problem I could 
detect is that the ridges on the insides of the synchronizer rings are 
worn down pretty good. I'm going to replace them at only ~$13 each, but 
the synchronizer is $247 from Volkswagen! I've found it for  $225 at a 
German distributor that typically has excellent prices.

Well it's still cheaper than having it done professionally. Any 
recommendations on where to go for the best price? At this price I do not 
want to replace the 1st/2nd for preventative maintenance. Has anyone ever 
had their 1st/2nd break? I'm worried that the 1st/2nd is soon to follow 
but hoping that it's only 3rd/4th that experiences the stress that leads 
to failure. All other gears and bearing look/sound good. Anything that I 
should replace now that the transmission is apart?

Thanks for all the help I have received. I particularly want to thank 
Brian Isherwood and Tom Carrington for their diagnostic skills and 
encouragement.

Steve
