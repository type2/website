Spotted at a used car lot - Weird untalkative salesman so know 
nothing but what I saw.

'87 Red Westi, Automatic, 115K miles, Air conditioning, GL model.  
Some oil leak, but no obvious coolant.  Interior great shape.
Looked in great shape, better be for the asking price of $11,988
1-800-487-1515 Pacific Auto &amp; Trailer, Auburn CA (30 miles NE of 
Sacramento)  I drive by everyday, so can check it out further if 
needed, pmail.
