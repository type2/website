Hi all

So William sez:

&gt;whatever. If you want owning a VW to be easy and cheap, move to
&gt;Germany.

And Joel replies:

&gt;.. now, if only South Africa would start making Left-hand-drive models
&gt;and shipping them over here!!! ;)


William: Move to South Africa. Germany is definitely _not_ cheap, and old
VWs are even more unpopular there that they are in the US. Because, if you
can take an old car off the road, you can sell a new one. And if you can
convince the public that it's a good idea (i.e. we're taking all these
polluting cars off the road (by polluting while making the replacement cars)
or use electric cars to cut down on polution (and burn coal somewhere else))
you really have it made.

Now over here, cars are a _lot_ more expensive than over there, if you
figure typical salaries &amp; taxes. But no smog test :-) And no cup holders in
cars, and not many auto boxes for that matter. The typical American has
grown to accept a helluva lot of 'extras' included in the basic price. For
example warranties - the UK has basic warranties, US has 5 year full
warranties or something, and the vehicle is cheaper in the US as well. (This
is for Land Rovers, ISTR)

So if you like T3 Vanagons, move over here. You can still buy them new
_at_$20K, +-, and you can even get _round headlights_ :-) (You can buy square
grills &amp; lights aftermarket)


Joel:
  There is no way that we'll even think of going to the trouble of all the
emission SH*T to export Vanagons. Not to mention that it'll be way
expensive. Especially with the 'options' like PS and AC which are pretty
standard around your neck o' the woods. Remember, they're _your_
EPA/DOT/whatnot criteria, what's good for the company is good for you :-)
