Sarah,

There may be no controls between the countries inside the European
Community. But you have to follow some rules of border traffics
(alcohol, drugs (specially when coming from NL) etc.) and
sometimes you will find small frontier checks. UK speciality is the
animal quarantine by entering the island. In the past years I saw no
checks on the borders of Holland, Belgium and France.

Next week I will be in Harderwijk, NL for short holidays and have to
unsubscribe in this time. For additional questions mail directly today.

I'm hopefully taking a trip in my '62 bus (um, yeah) to France driving
thro' Belgium to Holland, sailing back to UK from Holland. I have
some doubts as to the smoothness of my re-entry into the country
coming from the Land of Sin, in a Split, accompanied by a Long-
Haired Young(ish) Man.
Advice? I guess the law is different here than in the States - anyone
know? Any UKers on the list actually done this?

More questions to come about this trip..

Sarah
