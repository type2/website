Subject: Re: FS:  '89 Westy at 200% profit!!!

 &gt;&gt;  Just wanted to let everyone know that I have had numerous transactions
 with Mr. Salmon and have been extremely pleased with his honesty.  I have
purchased numerous parts for my Westy from him and he has been very fair
 in all deals.  Most of the Vans I have seen are in excellent to good shape
 at very resonable prices.  I have not seen this van nor am I sure of book
value, but if he says it is excellent condition, then it is.  I have
 bought used mechanical parts from Ron and he even exchanges them for me if
they do not work. Find that from anyone else and I will be suprised.  It
 is a shame that someone who has no prior knowledge (or so it seems) wants
 to be ignorant.  I just wanted to let everyone know my experience with Ron. &lt;&lt;

 I wouldn't know Ron Salmon if he came up and bit me on the ankle.  But he sold
me a Bentley manual for $67.50 and that is a hell of a savings over the usual
price. The deal was simple and straightforward:  send a check, get a book.  I
look forward to working with him in the future.
