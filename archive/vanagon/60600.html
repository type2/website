Todd:
I cured this problem by stopping a vacuum leak around one of the four
large rubber hoses that connect the intake manifold to the intake
runners.I noticed the intake manifold did not look centered. I slid the
rubber hoses into position by tapping them on the edge with a large
screw driver.
Good Luck

&gt;I have an odd occurance with my '88 Westy. In the morning when I start 
&gt;it and
&gt;drive around, it is as if gremlins are in the engine. What happens is 
&gt;that
&gt;occasionally, when at a stop the engine will  decide to idle at 2,000 
&gt;RPM.  A
&gt;good blip on the throttle will bring the idle back down to 900 RPM. 
&gt;There
&gt;seems to be no ryme or reason to when the engine will do this - but it 
&gt;is
&gt;more likely when it is first running.
&gt;
&gt;Ideas?
