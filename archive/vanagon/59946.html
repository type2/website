Ron, 
I was thinking the same thing, I prefer not to use the air unless it's
blistering out there. I was thinking about getting it filled and checked,
but was scared to know how many of the kids I'd have to sell (just kidding
of course! ;) ). From the sounds of it, if there is anything major wrong,
I'd be better off painting the top white ( currently beige metallic ),
getting some limo tint for the rear and side windows, and maybe even remove
the air to put in a moon-roof. Any thoughts on the subject ?

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I didn't use my air all last winter.  (I don't really believe in
it,
&gt; but my van came with it...)  Read the 'use it or lost it' thread.  Used
it
&gt; yesterday, but apparently I lost it.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  If I don't do anything about this for a couple of years, will
it
&gt; matter?  Does not being properly charged harm the system?
&gt;
