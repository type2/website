Subject: Re: Bike Racks

phphphtttt, excuse me :)
Bike racks can be bumper mounted on the front of buses without decreased 
visibility.  Tires are mounted on a sheet metal holder. Bikes shouldn't be 
mounted on the already mounted tires, the sheet metal isn't mounted strongly 
enoungh to stand up to the increased stress of the bikes.
