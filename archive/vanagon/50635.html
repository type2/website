&gt; Hi folks:
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me if there were any diesel syncros ever made?  I believe the
&gt; diesel Vanagons were last made in about 82' and that syncros began production
&gt; in about 86'. Any thoughts?

Hello Gary! In europe transporter syncro pickup singlecab/crewcab was 
aviable with 1.6 litre turbodiesel. Both 14 and 16 inch wheel versions 
had this engine.
