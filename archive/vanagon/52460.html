&gt;$1200? one reason I'm glad to unload the Corrado, try $1000 for the
&gt;computer and $1200 for the accumulator.  Never a problem but always
&gt;in constant fear.  In ABS's defense I drive fairly well and can
&gt;modulate a stock system better than ABS except ABS can really save
&gt;your ass when you get totally out on a totallly unexpected bit of
&gt;loose stuff in a corner.  Still they are not coming because the
&gt;insurance companies that are the true root behind all of this have
&gt;decided that statisticallly they did not help, ABS increases your
&gt;stopping distance as a rule, just allows you to stop, people were
&gt;thinking they had &quot;super&quot; brakes and driving even more like idiots.
&gt;

So if people drive more like idiots, why blame the insurance companies? All
they did was prove statistically they ABS doesn't help. Yeah, statistically
it helps; it helps people drive faster (on average, on average!) but
doesn't decrease the total$$ value of accidents.

So people are handed a good deal, ABS, and they consume the virtues of it
by driving fast instead of consuming the virtues of it by enjoying lower
premiums.

Now of course, most of us (ahem!) don't drive faster with ABS; it's just
the limited number who screw it up for the rest of us.

But isn't that the same thing as original sin?
