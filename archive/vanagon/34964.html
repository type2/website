&gt;Winter Van Starting Tip:
&gt;
&gt;	Take the space heater that you normally leave in your van to preheat
&gt;your interior (my landlord pays electricity and I have a GFI outlet)
&gt;and put it in your engine compartment.  Take some cloth type items and
&gt;stuff them into your air vents.
&gt; 
&gt;	In about an hour, you will have a toasty warm preheated engine.  This got
&gt;me going when it was like -20F (COLD) so I could go jumpstart all of my friends
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Don't try any of this if you are afraid of starting your car on fire, but I fig
&gt;it was too damned cold for a fire to possibly start....

 Or you could use a light bulb. I used to put a 250W  light with a foil 
reflector under the oil pan.
I had planned to make some air intake vent plugs, and put the light in
the engine compartment but didn't get around to it. That was
when I was also paranoid about getting snow in the vents when parked outside
at work today. I pictured styrofoam plugs. I was going to get
my wife to get me some of the bright red 8&quot; long &quot;Remove Before Flight&quot;
streamers that they use on aircraft control locks so I remembered
to remove them;-)
I thought it would look neat in the parking lot;-0 
It also would have gone with the bumper sticker which was on the van when
I got it. it states &quot;WARNING! This Equipment Emits X-RAYs When Energized&quot;
complete with a purple radiation symbol;-)
