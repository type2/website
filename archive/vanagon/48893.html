&gt; 
&gt; Dear Experts:
&gt; 
&gt; Skip Montanaro (skip_at_automatrix_dot_com) suggested that i forward my query to
&gt; you! Thanks for your help.
&gt; 
&gt;    I may be approaching the 3rd water pump changeout on my 84 Vanagon..
&gt;    
&gt;    What gives?
&gt;    
&gt;    Why does my bus eat water pumps every 35k miles?
&gt;    
&gt;    Is there a heavy duty version available?
VW issued a tech bulletin acknowledging the weakness in the water-pump
bearing. Unfortunately, if you want the modified version it will cost you
mucho bucks ,($225.00) . A rebuilt of the original design cost $45.00
or $90.00 for a new but based on the old design. Pick your choice. I too
am on my third water-pump. Yes, 35k miles is about right.   
&gt;    Is this a do it yourself job?
&gt;    If you are a novice, prepare to spend at least half a day. If I were
to do it again, it'll take me at least two hours approx.
