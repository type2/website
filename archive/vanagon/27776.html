Subject: discount with RMMW visa?

 Hey all, I have heard that if you have a visa card issued through Rocky
Mountain Motorworks, that you get a 20% discount when ordering from
their catalog with their card.
As I can't seem to get through any of the 1-800 numbers, I was wondering
if anyone out there could confirm or disprive this theory. It would be
nice...
Thanks
