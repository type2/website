Subject: Re: Where to buy tire chains?

&gt;I'm looking for a set of chains for my bus (205/75R14).

If this is a vanagon, there is a note in my Syncro drivers manual NOT to put 
chains on this size tire, 195/75/14 is stated as OK. Those rear wheel wells 
are huge, lots of clearance but I don't have 205s on so I can't check. Nor 
do my snow chains reach that big (195 max). I can look here for chains, it's 
spring, they may be cheap, the Canadian dollar certainly is!  lemme know
