So Marcus G. Doherr_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody give me some good sources/addresses for new and/or used 
&gt; vanagon (1980) parts in the Central California (Sacramento) area?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------
&gt; A pretty 'fresh' VAN owner:

&quot;Fresh, eh?  Martha will like that.  ;P

Anyway, you're an Aggie eh?  You scum  ;)

Will get yer self over to Sacramento (the big city wannabe cow town) and
go out to Sunrise Blvd. and head south.  You'll go about 2 miles or so.
There auto wreckers all over the place down there.  But the best one to
start with is the &quot;Pick-n-Pull&quot; place.  One buck to get in.  Just have
a look around.  What I usually do is bring a medium crecent wrench, medium
flat blade screwdriver and a medium phillips tip screwdriver.  I pay the
$1 and go in and have a look see at what they got.  If I can remove the
part with the aforementioned tools, then I do that.  If not I go back to
my car for the tools I need.  They stamp your hand so you can come back
in anytime that day.  Bring your grubbies and go to it.

There are other places the the Bug recyclers and all kind of recyclers but
there a rip-off, cause they pull the parts and charge top dollar for the
used parts.  Bring the yellow pages with you so you can locate the other
places down there if you need to.  

There's wrecking yards in North Sac. too but I don't go there to much.

I assume that there are some in West, Sac also, but I don't know them either.

Maybe Thom does....

Cheers!
