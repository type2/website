Actually, my grandfather used to do surveying for the local county
when they were building the main road around here. One thing he did
(at the ripe old age of 72) was to walk ALL 112 miles of route
13, pushing one of those wheely things. Every 5280 feet, he pounded
a stake. It took him 3 months, but those signs are not more
than a foot off, I would wager. I feel somehow proud every time
I see one.

I also use them to gauge my speedometer. I usually take a 2 mile
reading late at night, holding exactly 50 MPH and calculate
my offset. I am only off by 2%, though. The tread wear is enough
to change it by more than 5%.
