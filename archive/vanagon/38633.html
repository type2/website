Subject: WB Head Gasket Replacement

I am planning to write up the step-by-step procedure for R&amp;R the heads in
the wasserboxer unless someone has already done so.

I reviewed the archives and found the images from Import Service which are
OK but deal with the job with the engine removed. Much more difficult for
the DIY mechanic.

Are there any known detailed directions on this job?

BTW, I &quot;learned&quot; from the regional VW Service Mgr. that the FTC agreement
is to terminate in May. Is this true and if so, does that leave everyone
with problems developing later with no recourse other than a lawsuit?

My '91 is doing fine but my daughter's '91 has terribly pitted heads with
some pitting on the block. I worry what happens when my heads begin to
leak.

I will reinforce what has been mentioned several times on this group.
Change your anti-freeze at least every other year. The rust inhibitors
decay and the pitting begins and so do problems. I'm not sure of the direct
cause and effect but it sure should help avoid the problem as long as
possible.
