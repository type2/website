Subject: WESTFALIA ADVICE NEEDED!
Date: Wed, 01 Feb 95 14:26:00 EST


After owning several type 1 VWs, I eventually downsized to owning just my 67 
Ghia cabriolet in 1992.  But I've always loved Westfalias and have been 
fighting the urge to get one for some time.  I think it's a losing battle, 
and before I do lose it I'd like to get others' advice about buying one.  I 
think I'd prefer a 70s model since I like the older styling (when did the 
chrome bumpers go anyway?) and am not likely to find many pre-70 buses in 
good shape.  Anyway, any help in the following areas would be really 
appreciated:

1) What to look for when checking the vehicle over?

I know what to look for and avoid when it comes to Beetles and Ghias, but 
Westfalias are completely foreign to me.  What should I look for (i.e. 
things that should and shouldn't be)?  Is there a reference or buyers guide 
for making good choices out there?  What are the pros and cons of the 
different generations/model years?

2) Can a 70s box be made winter-worthy?

Here in Ottawa, Canada they salt the roads in winter.  My fiancee points out 
that my Ghia already sits on blocks all winter, and that we need 
winter-worthy transportation (she wants a Golf).  Is bus heat as mediocre as 
other air-cooled machines?  Is it feasible to somehow prevent the spead of 
cancerous rust through oil-sprays or other conditioning?  Or is it basically 
just a bad idea to hope to keep a Westfalia &quot;clean&quot; if it gets exposure to 
winter roads?

3)  What are the biggest pros and cons of owning a Westfalia?  How far and 
fast can you reasonably travel on the 4 cylinder engine, and what is the 
&quot;best&quot; engine to look for?  I've been told hydraulic lifters are a real 
blessing - when did they first appear?

Thanks to all who can find the time to share their insights and experience!
