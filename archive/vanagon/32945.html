Subject: flat spot

Joe,

   You didn't mention whether or not you have rebuilt the carb. Another
problem I thought of could be the accelerator pump.  If the pump is weak or
clogged with debris it will not pump fuel into the carb when you step on
the throttle.  Lack of fuel will mean a lean mixture and FLAT SPOT, until
the carb can compensate for the fuel loss.  Its just a thought. I would
consider rebuilding the carb. The kit is cheap, $12, even from the dealer.
Just give them the carb number when ordering(34pict-3)  Comes with
everything you'll need except float, and it only takes a couple of hours.
Longer if you want to soak the carb pieces in solvent. I would get a couple
of cans of carb clean and spray all the passages good with it. Then, if
possible, blow the carb clean with compressed air.   Good luck.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
