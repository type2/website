Subject: Re: Where's rear wiper switch on '87 GL

That's odd... on my '85 you push the lever toward the dash till get
adequate washer fluid on the rear window, then let the lever go... it
spring returns to the off position and the wiper makes a few more cycles
then parks on its' own... are later models different or is your Switch
broken Steven...??
