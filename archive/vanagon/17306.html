Subject:  swivel seats

Newbie just obtained an 81 Adventurewagen, my first VW van, although
I've wanted one for an eternity. The front seats don't swivel like the
westy ones do, though, and I've decided this is a feature I can't live
without.  I've located, but haven't yet seen an 83 parts westy (no top,
much interior water damage), but the upholstery and innards of the front
seats are in really bad shape.  I'm wondering if I can just take the swivel
bases and put them on my seats.  Any comments/suggestions would be
greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
