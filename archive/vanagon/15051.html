I'm familiar with info. in the archives of this list to effect that an 
FTC situation has led to a &quot;secret warranty&quot; for certain engine/head 
repairs, especially within 50,000 miles of when vehicle was new.

I have a somewhat unique variation of this case. My heads were replaced 
two to three years ago, and after the accumulation of about 25,000 miles 
(heads replaced at 133k, now at 155k or so).

Would you think that a 100% reimbursement should be available due to the 
fact that head gaskets go out this soon after heads redone?

TIA

James Cook
