Subject:      Eurovan T belt Broke at 73K!!!!!

Listees,

  As some of you know I work in a repair shop too,  On the Hook came a 94 Eurovan 73K
on the clock.  Timing belt broke!

  This tells me a couple of things;

  One that if there is an interval to do a service, LISTEN!

  And 2 that the theroy of the newer timing belts being made similar to the Japanese
car belts lasting 90 K, I Don't Think So!

  Just want ed to pass on the word about the Mileage.  I've seen Jettas, Golfs Etc go
80-90K on a belt.  The weight of the vehicle may have something to do with the mileage
too.

  Eurovan Drivers Beware.

  Kyle
