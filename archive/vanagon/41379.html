&gt;I would appreciate suggestions on a smooth riding tire for my 85 Van.  I
&gt;replaced some aging pasenger tires with UniRoyal LT light truck tires
(6ply),
&gt;but of course they ride like a truck.  
&gt;Best,

For best ride and handling, I recomend a good high performance tire in a
215-70/14.  Firestone also makes a LT  tire in this size.  It is the Firehawk
R4S.  Has an LTP rating instead of the normal P as for a passenger car.
 Still only load range B but has adequate capacity in this size.  Looks like
a well mannered tire for our application.  Dunlop now has a Sport Rover GTX2.
 HR speed rated sport utility tire.  Interesting tread design and reasonable
price. Yoka hama A378 also good tire for this application.  I've seen a few
used on the Vanagon with great results except for life of only 45K or so.
 Handles great in rain or snow though.  Especially on a Syncro.

Dennis.
