Subject: Re: Sink cabinet for 71 Westy-how to find


&gt;I wouldn't bother if I were you.  In the seven years I have been camping
&gt;in my 73, that space behind the passenger seat has become very dear to me,
&gt;and I just recently ripped out the stove-fridge unit that was there and
&gt;moved it to the other side of the camper (behind the driver).  I am sick

I'll second this, it works well, also turn the unit so the door opens into 
the aisle, easier to reach cold stuff while driving, and the little flip 
table works well. Put the rear facing seat in its place, it can be removed 
rapidly to gain space and doesn't block the door/handle anywhere near as 
badly when left in. My van seemed bigger after I did this. Be prepared to do 
some light trimming to make it fit neatly. The little cabinet/flip table on 
the side of the fridge unit can be put somewhere more suitable, I garaged 
mine.  tim s.
