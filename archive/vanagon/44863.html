Subject: Resurrection of '64 Deluxe

I plan to tow the newly acquired '64 Sunroof Deluxe Bus home this evening 
and start the process of getting it back on the road.  It has been 
sitting (inside a barn) for 13 years.  I will drop the motor and pull the 
tank (to have it cleaned), will replace the fuel pump and probably 
rebuild the carb.  Dave Easterwood suggested that I go ahead and rebuild 
the motor (the Bus has 61K miles).  I would like to get this Bus going ASAP, 
but if a rebuild is required, then it will be done (but probably not by 
me).  I also plan to change all fluids and refresh all lubricants.  Any 
other ideas or requirements?

Still grinnin',
