Subject: Mexican Busses

All,

I've been thinking (now,now David don't hurt yourself), since the busses
in Mexico are watercooled, do they suffer the same head gasket leaks
that the Vanagons get?  If not then why don't those that are looking at
replacing the heads of their Vanagons look in to ordering them from
VWoMex? If they do then the point is moot of course.

Someone who speaks spanish could call them and ask if they are running
into complaints from owners regarding head leaks.

Just a thought,

David
