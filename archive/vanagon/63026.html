Subject:      shocks

Rod,

I'm probably a li'l late but here's my 2cents:

ANY 4 shocks costing that much should be super hi-performance shocks.
You should be able to find better-than-stock dampers at most
tire/suspension stores (Monroe, Gabriel, Rancho, etc.) for a lot less.
In FourWheeler magazine, you can find ads for ProComp, Softrider,
Explorer and others that all make a very good shock.  And no, they're
not &quot;off road only&quot; shocks, that's just how they're marketed.  In short,
non-stock shocks from your local suspension shop or mail order.

Does anyone no of a cheaper aftermarket source for  '93 EV shocks? Even
the Bus Depot wants $390/4 which is still cheaper than the $640/4 list.

                        Thanks, Rod in west Texas
