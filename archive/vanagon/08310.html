Subject:       Coolant bleeder valves revisited

Hmmmm--
gerry says pulling back/out (on the bleeder knob) didn't work for him. 
 Did the knob AND shaft come out/off or just the knob?  Here's one additional thing to 
try.  The knob and pseudo needle valve is held into the female socket 
by a black plastic retaining sleeve (notches in this sleeve hold it 
to the female part).  Use a pliers to gently squeeze the notched part 
of this retainer so that it may be removed.  Now remove the knob 
(hopefully with shaft, if not, go have a beer) and things should be 
wide open.  Poke a suitable thingy in the hole to make sure it's 
clear.

Honest folks, this worked for me.  Don't delete me!
