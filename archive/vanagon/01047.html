Subject: two questions

I hope you will excuse me if I ask too many questions, and if they are 
somewhat naive.

1.  I'm turning my &quot;new&quot; 84 vanagon into a camper (with a queen sized bed!).
I have taken out the rear passenger seats (anybody want them?  This is 
Billings, Montana).  It has been suggested that I have the sidewalls 
filled with urethane insulation.  Reportedly it cuts the noise way down.
Is this a good idea?  The main thing I'm worried about is that if body 
work has to be done and considerable heat applied to the outside, how will
that affect the insulation?  Could there be toxic fumes?

Should I just stuff some fiberglass insulation in there?  I wouldn't worry
about heat and fumes, but maybe there wouldn't be the desired sound-
deadening?

2.  This vanagon has fuel injection, with which I have no experience.  A
mechanic advised me to put 3 ounces of automatic transmission fluid in
every third tank of gas to keep the injectors clean.  I would welcome
comments on this.

Will
