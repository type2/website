Subject: Trips &amp; Vacations

This Baja trip and all the net-talk about has got me dreaming about it. I told my wife Susan who has been there before.....We just live so far (New-Orleans) and it wouldn't be feasible.

I remember in Europe, there had groups where someone will borrow cars, when they went some place.....and then you could do the same, I think that's still going on there.


Well, we could have something like that, couldn't we ? I am personally not selfish and as long as there is no liability, I wouldn't mind letting the van be borrowed by someone


In summary, If you wanted to come to... say to the Smokey Mountains (6hr drive from my place), you could fly here, borrow my van for a week, and fly back home. Same in my case, since driving from here to San Diego would be impractical for the BAJA trip, I could fly over and borrow someone's (who, of course, is not going) van and take the 3-4 day trip and fly back.  Provided we have car insurance, driver's license and a decent driving record, I believe it could be a great benefit to all of us bus-travelers.
