Subject: Re: Coolant Refill Bottle

That's funny I just wanted to make a post about loss of coolant, and
there were several post to day on the subject.
Check the rear heater core, said one. Under the rear seat. But my car
only has a front seat so what would it mean to that type of car? What is
a core? Same as hose or tube?
My car drinks about 1 litre per 100 kilometres. (we're metric over here,
approx 1 pint of water per 35 miles)
Also could someone fill me in on the right pressure for the tyres.
Metric or not, I'll figure it out. Waterboxer, 2.0 litre engine, gas,
1984, yellow...
