&gt; Hey volks,
&gt; The two engine tins that fit directly under each cylinder head are
&gt; missing on my '77 Camper (the omnibus). Would it be worth scrounging
&gt; around for replacements, how much of a cooling effect is the engine missing?

If they are the ones *above* the pushrod tubes, replace them now -
they are vital.  If they are the ones below the pushrod tubes (that
attach on one side to the heat exchangers) then it's not that big of a
deal.  Mine were missing for a couple of years before I finally found
replacements.  Not that I'm proud of it.  I would install replacements
as soon as possible.  :)
