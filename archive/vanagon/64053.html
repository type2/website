&lt;&lt; Hi all, 
 
 Perhaps everyone should slow down before they jump on this 
 &quot;slam the vendor&quot; bandwagon.  There are good and bad guys 
 out there, and it now seems that perhaps Kenneth Winter owes 
 Ron Salmon an apology  for his recent post.  I'm just saying that 
 everyone should slow down and check things out before you type 
 something you might regret later.
 
 Enough said,

Good advice Bill,

I recently ordered exhaust components from Ron at 
Bus Depot, and for one reason or another, there was a mistake on his part
about how to ship the stuff.

When I called him about it, he realised his mistake, apologised and went way
beyond what any retailer would likely do to correct a probem,  even to the
point of absorbing the cost of &quot;Overnight Guaranteed Delivery&quot;.
 Unfortunately,  those costs were far beyond any profit for the parts.

I feel bad that he lost money on my order and hope future business with Ron
will be profitable for him.

Misunderstandings and mistakes can and will happen especially in the
mail-order business,  but I can verify Bus Depot's sincerity and honesty, and
I find it hard to believe that Bus Boys would intentionally cheat their
customers.

I know it doesn't help the frustration we can experience on a botched order,
 but where would we be without mail-order places to buy VW stuff???
