Subject: Update: 88 Vanagon with &quot;thing&quot; on steering column??

Last I wrote:

&gt;  Sorry, I've seen the little thumwheel style knobs there for heated seats
and
&gt;  this is not anything like a thumwheel.  It looks like a little electronic
&gt;  display of some sort.

I have contacted the owner of the 88 Westy in question and he doesn't know
what the &quot;thing&quot; is.  He had apparently never noticed it.  He said that he
would look at it and see if he can figure out what it is &amp; get back to me.

That was a week ago and I have not heard back from him yet.  
The van is for sale though.  I gave him instructions on how to subscribe to
the list and suggested that he place an ad on the list.  Of course, you all
know that a used car in Phoenix will have no rust, it will however have a
&quot;thing&quot; on the steering column.
I haven't seen his ad appear on the list either though.
