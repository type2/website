Subject: Re: Tire question again



&gt;Well I put passenger tires on mine before reading the info on the list. 
They
&gt;are Goodyear Arivas (205/70R14). They work ok but I would say they feel 
real
&gt;squishy compared to the Michilens that were on there before. I have logged
&gt;about 14,000 miles on them without incident, but would feel better 
cornering
&gt;with a tire with a stiffer sidewall, so they will probably get moved over 
to
&gt;my Thing if I have the clearance in the front. My recommendation is to go
&gt;with the light truck rated tires, afterall your vanagon is a light truck
&gt;(almost 5000 lbs). I will be switching tires before winter.


Well, to each his own. But may I submit that, in snow, Goodyear Arrivas were
superior to any tire I have ever put on a car, except some studded snow 
tires on
a Datsun 810 once. This was back in my Summit COunty Colorado days,
when snow was snow and VW's were king of the blizzard-warning circuit.
