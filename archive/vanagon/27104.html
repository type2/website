&gt; story.  Imagine that, towing a Syncro Westy behind your motorhome.  Maybe
&gt; they towed a compact car behind the Westy.  Maybe they towed a motorcycle
&gt; behind the compact.  Oh well, I'm drivelling now.........
&gt; 
Actually, I'd rather not imagine this, if they indeed TOWED a Syncro
westy behind a motorhome, I hardly imagine they towed it on a trailer
with all four wheels off the ground, which could add up to a terrifying
nightmare of VWoA parts prices.  Might explain why it was being sold
with 15,000 miles.
