Subject: installing the dash blower in a Kombi...

A friend of mine has just purchased a '80 Vanagon Kombi, and it lacks, among
other niceties, the dash blower and fan speed switch. 
Has anyone ever retrofitted a dash blower into a commercial series that did
not have one? is the wiring already there for it?

TIA,

chris
