Subject: Vanagon front bike rack seen in Victoria?

Yesterday I saw a late Vanagon Westy, white like mine, with a kayak 
on top *and* a front mounted hitch type bike rack!

In the few seconds I had to gawk at it, I noticed what appeared to be 
a black steel frame mounted just below the front bumper, to which the 
hitch-rack was bolted.
Is the owner on the list, or does anyone know of this van in 
Victoria, BC?

Thx.
