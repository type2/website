Well folks this will have to be my last post for a couple
of weeks since I'll be on vacation.  I'll probably sign off
and ask good ole what's-his-name for a digest. ;)  

The VW dealer got the part (resistor pack) for my AC unit and I
expect to pick my baby up after work.  I really am disgusted
with the way they handled it and will not be returning to them
for any service.  

I'll do a trip report if there is interest.  Hell, I'll do one
anyway. :P  

Sing a song for me Unca Joel so I can putter down the road with
a smile...... :)
