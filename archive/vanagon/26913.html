Here is where the old bunker burner is a real plus.  You can push the pedal
all the way to the floor with no noticible increase in speed while spewing
large black clouds of *retching* smoke out the back.  

It was great fun in my old diesel bunny.

 &gt;     Maybe I should be get some of those european rear fog lights to flash
 &gt;     them, or one of those Hella third brake lights like Joel's,..but maybe
 &gt;     its not in the nature of a bus. I could just take the sign off, until
 &gt;     the next VW Van meet....
