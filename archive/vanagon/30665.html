&gt;In the winter I use RainX Fog on the inside of my windshield.  Seems to do a
&gt;good job of keeping fog off.  Doesn't help with ice on the outside tho.
&gt;Anybody else try this stuff?
&gt;BTW, I have mixed feelings about normal RainX on the outside of the windshield

i had problems with normal RainX on the INSIDE of the windshield ... it caused
lots of rainbow distortion spots at night. but on the outside, it was ok ...
the only problem i had was perception of speed: since the rain drops were
scooting away, i THOUGHT i was going slower than i really was. and in rain,
this is (imho) dangerous.  so i quit using it. (besides, it's a pain to put
put that stuff on a vanagon windshield! :)

now, in the winters down south, normal RainX works great on the outside
mirrors and rear glass ... it keeps dew and ice from forming. didn't try it
while i was up north, in &quot;real&quot; winter. :)

never tried the Fog stuff.
