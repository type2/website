Recipe for a &quot;Bus Roll&quot; or how to enjoy the benefits of a roller 
coaster, but waste a bus in the meantime.

&gt;     You've got to be joking... I have done some real stunts
&gt;     but never rolled.... Obviously your going to try this again?

That I actually rolled a bus?  No it actually happened, a full one 
and one quarter roll.  It was not due to tremendous stunt driving 
abilities however.  

&quot;Bus Roll&quot;

Best served with a generous helping of 
humility, fatalism and good fortune for occupants.
Take one part Black Ice, 
One part '76 Riviera Camper,
Two parts Gusting 40 mph cross winds,
With about a 25 mile per hour travel speed.
Mix generously near Brandon, Manitoba, Canada in October.

The resulting combination yields the following:
As we were travelling the front end blew around so we were facing 
backwards, at least for while.  With the now tractionless bus going 
backwards the wind continued to push us sideways also.,  We
came to the edge of the road and onto the leeward side of the freeway 
embankment.  The right front tire hit the dirt, came off the rim and we 
proceeded to rollover in the 8 inches of grass with about 6 inches of 
that white fluffy cold stuff on top.  Slow roll, almost ended back up 
on the wheels, and then one of those slow motion falls over onto it's 
right side.  No injuries at all to myself, only one huge bruise to my wife 
on her thigh as a wooden box between the seats crashed onto her.  I 
believe in seat belts, even more so after that.  I also believe in 
lashing down as much gear inside the vehicle as possible.

We were able to exit the bus through the driver's door and proceeded 
to figure out what to do in the blizzard.  SO headed to the road to 
obtain help, while I assessed damage and see what I could do.  I 
gained entrance through the driver's door and found the following:
The water tank had parted with it's moorings and was pouring water 
over contents of interior.  I opened slider sliding window, yanked 
(or since I was in Canada, was it canadianed) the water tank out and 
drained it through the open window.  Every bit and piece of stuff had 
been tossed about thoroughly, including our expensive cameras.  
Since the cameras were the only valuables, I gathered them up and 
exited the bus, to find my SO.  I was found by a RCMP trooper who had 
stopped to investigate big rig that had jack-knifed behind us. When I 
got back to the bus, I was unable to get in through the driver's 
door, as it had frozen.  The pop-top came loose and I was had to 
crawl in through the opening.

SO had gotten a ride to a cafe, and was trying to get a tow company 
interested in rescuing us, to no avail.  THEY didn't want to go out in 
the storm either.  Karma stepped in.   Next to the phone was a tow 
crew, getting a bite to eat, overheard SO and offered assistance.

I was riding around in a RCMP patrol car, all nice and warm, trying 
to find SO.  Seems the tow truck had REAL difficulty gaining traction 
in the snow, at least until they hooked up the VW.  Withe added 
weight the slogged out to the road again.  We needed other.
We got it towed to a Buick dealer in Brandon, who allowed us to
place in inside their work area to thaw out.  The next morning after 
it had thawed out, checked out the damage.  RF tire off rim, RR upper 
corner bashed in, no glass broken, doors all sorta worked, entire bus 
kinda twisted.  I started fine, so we put the tire back on the rim and 
away we drove to SO's family in  Kelliher Saskatchewan (a couple 
hundred miles further NORTH).  Stayed a few days and were able to make 
a few repairs to seal out the cold,  but pop top not functional.  But 
who wants to camp in 5 degree weather (no aux heater)
After arriving in Seattle and checking further on 
damage, the insurance company totaled it. Did have to replace the 
clutch cable in 5 degree weather however on the way home.
We met some nice helpful folks in the crash area.  Including the RCMP.

Do it again, naw.  Well at least not on purpose.  Wife still won't 
drive a bus after that.  That was 13 years ago.  Still willing to be 
a passenger, tho after that I don't know why.

I did learn that it would be nice to have a second exit from a bus 
that's crashed onto it's right side.  Previous post details exit 
handle location for a Vanagon rear hatch.
