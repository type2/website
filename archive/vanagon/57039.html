OK, I changed oil and oil light shut off.  Now, the alternator light
comes on when I first start at an idle.  Also, when starter is turning
over motor, sounds like fast clicking on the dash gauge area.  When
engine revved off idle, light goes out.  Any thoughts appreciated!!!

Also, saw a Euro MV- opposing rear seats, fold out table, pop top- nice!
