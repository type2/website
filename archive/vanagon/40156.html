Subject: Re: gasoline prices


&gt;&gt;I haven't seen any increase in the price of gas here in
&gt;&gt;Switzerland really. It's still around US $1 ....  a liter!
&gt;&gt;That's US $4 a gallon. So stop bitchin' will ya!   :-)

&gt;If you all in Switzerland had done some bitchin' years ago, the government
&gt;might not have made your price so high!  :-)

I think that's good old market forces making it that high-- every country
in Europe has similar prices, and has had forever.

But I do wonder why they can't buy it as cheaply from the Middle East
as the U.S. obviously does.

 &quot;Lord, give me serenity to accept what I cannot change, the strength to
 change that which I can, and the the firepower to make the difference.&quot;
