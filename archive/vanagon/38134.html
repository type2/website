&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I posted about my &quot;budget&quot; stereo setup in my Vanagon on monday and
&gt;many of you requested details.  There were so many requests that I
&gt;decided to write up a Budget Stereo FAQ for Vanagons.  For those of
&gt;you who would like to receive it, please let me know.  It is fairly
&gt;long and I've done it on Microsoft Write that comes w/ Windows as a
&gt;txt file so I don't want to waste everybody's time by posting it
&gt;here..  This is so most of you can read it with no trouble.  I'll
&gt;send it as a file attachment to you.
&gt;
&gt;I'd also like to receive suggestions and ideas from anyone out there
&gt;who has something to contribute.  I'll add these to it and put it on
&gt;my webpage when I have that up in 2 or 3 weeks.

Please send me a copy.  Thanks.

Rich.
