Subject: Re: rust in air intake louvres '71



Steve,

I think you have found one of the most inaccessible spots on the bus! Right up 
there with the belly pan on the inside of the sunroof bus.

&gt;From what i can recall those &quot;intake vents&quot; are vertically vented down into the 
engine compartment. It might be advantageous to try and access them via the 
engine compartment route, although a few lessons in hatha yoga and having the 
ability of a mongolian contorshonist (sp?) might be in order to do this. The 
other option to derust htta area might be to use a very abrasive 3M scouring pad 
attached to a long stick that is thin enough to allow you to  manouver in that 
area. Regardless it is a pain in the butt ot get into that area and sand 
blasting might be the easiest route. Suffice to say that thos vents are 
connected to the engine comparment so i whatever crap is sucked, dropped etc . 
in there will evetually make it's way into the engine comparnment.

Maybe someone with more knowledge of a 1971 would be better able to comment.

&gt; I'm going to do some rust-busting soon on my '71 bus. Inspecting the
&gt; vehicle, I found rust spots on the *inside* of the air intake louvres. Now,
&gt; before applying anti-rust stuff, you have to wash the area and wire-brush
&gt; the rust away. How can I do that in this location? Can I safely hose down
&gt; the inside of these louvres? Where will all the rust flakes and general crap
&gt; and water go? Won't it all get sucked into somewhere it shouldn't be?
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has dealt with rust in this esoteric location, I'd appreciate any
&gt; advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; -Steve Tokar
