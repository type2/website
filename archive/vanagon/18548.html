Subject: 1979 Westfalia manuals; refrigerators


Hello, all.  I'm a new member and anxious to benefit (and perhaps 
contribute a little to) the net collective wisdom.

Two quick questions.

Does anyone have/know of a source for owners' manuals for the Westfalia 
stuff on the 1979 camper?  There are a couple of little things (e.g., the 
auxiliary battery charging system) that I'd like some more information about.

Second, I have had the van about three years and it was a bit, er, 
mothballed when purchased.  But I scored a sink/stove/cabinet unit from a 
salvage yard in Austin, TX, and pretty much got the rest of the stuff 
running.  The problem at present is with the refrigerator.  It never 
worked super well, but would generally keep food cooled if (a) the food 
was pretty cool in the first place, and (b) the unit was started up with 
external power rather than off of the battery.  I tried for a while to 
cycle the unit off and on monthly to keep it working and also keep the 
battery charging/discharging, but like most good (?) habits this one 
lasted only for about a year or so.  Then no use of the frig (and the 
battery dead and apparently ruined) for about a year.  Then last week, in 
preparation for camping, the frig wouldn't cool from plug-in, even with 
lengthy (i.e., several hours) periods of operation.  I was a bit puzzled, 
because the coil and exchanger (?) under the hinged grill cover beside 
the refrigerator appeared to heat, but no cold in the frig.  
Suggestions?  I have heard of &quot;burping&quot; these units by removing them and 
turning them upside down to get stuff circulating, but that seems pretty 
drastic to me.  Other ideas?


Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide.
