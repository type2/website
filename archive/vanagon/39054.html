Subject: new westy!

a lovely afternoon for an adventure, so a friend and i drove out in the great
northwoods........

remember that 65 westy with safaris i mentioned a couple months ago?   Well,
i made arragements to buy it and go get it today.    The guy lives out in the
Boonies 10 miles from redneck ville, out in the sticks, past the clear cuts.
 Has a mechanic shop but doesn't advertise, and a penchant for picking up
vws.  Only has about a hundred or so.   Every one there wore something that
said Harley-Davidson on it, even the dog.   A place down the road advertised
 GUNS - CHEAP

So these good folks had picked up a European camper.  It had all the camper
stuff, less the door cabinets and half a dozen holes for speakers.  No pop
top, and the awning is missing, though there are brackets on the roof and
front bumper.  All the wood panels were painted brown with a brush, and are
garbage.  The roof panels really sag, so i'll be looking for replacement the
appropriate size.  Anyone done this?  Safari windows, less wiper arms and
pivots, sealed up good with silicone.    It also has a locking steering
column, but the PO had lost the keys.  luckily the column wasn't locked.   It
had wiring for the two tone taillights, though it has the red ones.  It has
two pop out windows in the back, and four solid ones, instead of the jalousie
windows the US sold ones have.   Kind of neat.  The body is straight and
mostly solid, a little rocker rot, with minimal holes in the front floor.  No
back bumper, ugly paint, and the back window broken out.  All in all, not too
bad

Oh, mechanical?  It was driven two years ago, I guess we'll see.....   At
least the motor didn't have any end play.

So we made the deal, got a few extra widgets off some other vdubs, hung out
and shot the sh%t.  It was real peaceful and quiet out there.

hooked up the tow bar to the camper, and hitched it to the 66 standard, set
up the lights, and pulled that thing about 40 miles home.   :)
