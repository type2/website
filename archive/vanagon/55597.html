&gt; &gt;You'll find a plug at the bottom of the case.  Open it and the transmission

&gt; &gt;out.  Clean the plug.  Put the plug back in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You'll find a simular plug half way up the side of the case, about half &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You'll find the plugs well corroded into place, you'll need a 17mm Allen
&gt; wrench or some similar tool.  BEFORE you dump the oil make sure you can get
&gt; the upper filling hole plug out!!  Otherwise you will be SOOL.  I use a
&gt; cheap pump from Crappy Tire/FLAPS to get the oil in, 75W90 Castrol from
&gt; KMart works fine. There is no easy way to get oil in other than the pump,
&gt; unless you like oil down your arms, all over the tranny, in the drive, and
&gt; you want to spent 1/2hr fighting it.  Buy the pump.   bye, tim

	Yes, do what Tim said. Heating the gear oil on the stove in a bucket of
water helps alot too. And make sure you can remove the side filler
first.
