Hi Volks,

We're designing the logo and webpage for our new neato/limbo chapter club
here in Ohio called the &quot;Tri-State Transporters&quot;. Does anyone have any
artwork they would like to share? Credit will be given! Does anyone know of
any &quot;web stashes&quot; for such artwork? I seem to remember an R.D. Robertson (I
hope the name is right) offering some artwork  while ago.

Any help appreciated!

Thanks,

tony
