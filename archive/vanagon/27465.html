Subject: 84 Westy engine/interior Oregon



I have a very wrecked 84 Westy (result of a collision with an ambulance
which was going through a red - rolled my van!).  All body panels are bent but 
the engine still works (155K) and the camper interior
(fridge, sink, stove, pop-top etc.) is all good.  I do not wnat to part it
out so its all or nothing.  Make me an offer.
