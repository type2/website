Subject: Da VDO pressure thang


	Well, being like I am, I will
give a VDO distrubitor a call and see if they can get this 
plate.  If they don't have it, perhaps just silver soldering a fitting
into the stock plate would work?

What problem would there be with this approach?

If people think this would work, I would probably make
one (or a few)

Matt
