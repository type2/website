Subject: Cleavis pin HELP (and adventure of the day)

Hey there all,
	The short of it is, I need a good temporary replacement for
the cleavis pin.  Will just any screw that fits in there be ok, or
will a threaded screw chew up the little bracket at the end of the
clutch cable.  Amelia is on her way to the parts store to get a new
clutch cable (might as well, I should have a spare anyway) and pin,
but I still need to get home today (about 22 miles). Thanks for the
advice.  Now for the story:)  


	Today has turned out better than I thought.  Instead of having
to work all morning, I got to spend some time under the bus!  Getting
off the freeway on my way to work, I go up the off ramp push the
clutch in, stop for the light.  It turns green I go to put it in
first, and IT WON'T GO.  Oh no!  I try all the gears, what's up?  I
take my foot off the clutch pedal, and there it stays, stuck to the
floor.  So I figure I better get off this hill and get out of the
way.  Rush hour and all, and I am blocking one of the two lanes of the
freeway exit ramp.  I turn off the motor (couldn't get it into first
with the motor running, I tried, but it felt like the shift lever
would break before it would go), get it into first and try and start
it.  The car is on an incline so it can't start because its in gear and
engaged, trying to throw the bus forward and start it at the same time.

	So, I'm a little happier, believe it or not.  Works been
rather stressful of late, and here is a perfect excuse to do something
relaxing (lay under the bus)  WOW.  All right, something is broken, and
I am thinking I can fix it.  I  put on the Ebrake and hazards, put
some wood  and shimmy on under.  Looks like the cable is broken I says
to myself.  About then I hear this voice. &quot;need any help?&quot;  I look
from under the bus and I can see another bus behind me.  I shimmy out,
and explain what's up.  He offers to push me up the rest of the hill
and get me moving so I can get it into gear and get to work.  So back
into the busses we go, he edges up, light turns green and away we go.
Up over the hill, start the motor, wait for the right speed, and slip
it (with barely any grind!) into 2nd.  A big wave to the magical bus
angel (I tell ya, I believe in karma now:)  We made it to work.  Had
to stop once, down shifted to 1st, then the complete stop stalled us
(hard to work brake and gas enough to keep it running and not shoot
out into traffic).  since we were on flat ground I was able to start it
in 1st.  

	And finally, get to work, let people know I'll be hard to find
for a bit.  I go out, pull on the clutch cable at the transition end,
It comes and comes, so I figure yep, its broken.  Take off the clutch
pedal assembly and notice that the cleavis pin had snapped in half
(who was it that said, &quot;CHECK AND GREASE YOUR CLEAVIS PIN!&quot;?  I
actually had on my list of things to do : where/what is a cleavis pin
and how do I grease it.  Well, now I know.  I'll go out at lunch, and
jerry rig something till I can get home and put the real thing in
there.  The only thing left of the cleavis pin was the head!  It had
been creaking a bit for the last few weeks every time I pressed on the
clutch.  I guess I should have known, letting noises go unheeded was a
bad thing.

	Well, that's my story.  I got to spend some time under the bus
today, at work even.  Hope everyone's day is going well!

take care,
	brandy
