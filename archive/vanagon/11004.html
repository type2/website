Subject: My Robot To Find Cyber-Vanagons

I have set my newsgroup robot to scan all 11,000 newsgroups and show me any
time anyone in the world posts a message with the word &quot;Vanagon&quot; in it. I
tested this and sure enough I seem to get about 1 message a day from
rec.autos.vw.

My robot sent me another message today in rec.autos.driving where the author
was disparaging the vanagon as too slow.

I may set my robot to forward all the posts that I get to the vanagon list
for your general amusement. If I do, I will try to change the subject line so
it starts &quot;(Robot)&quot; so you know it was a message not originally intended for
our list. 

I guess I should also scan for messages with the word &quot;Westfalia&quot; in them, or
possibly &quot;Combi.&quot; I wonder what other names I should scan for?
