&gt;&gt;Thom...why don't you order a Gene Berg dip stick thermo.?  They are
&gt;&gt;cheap, very accurate and connect to your oil light.._dot_causing it to
&gt;&gt;flicker when the temp. starts to get high (225-227 degrees).  The
&gt;&gt;part # is GB227a-228 depending on year of bus.  Gene Berg is at
&gt;&gt;(714) 998-7500

&gt;i would concur about the gene berg doodad, they are tres cheap and are
&gt;worth it IMHO. Better than spending $$$$$$$$$ for all of the VDO
&gt;guages

I just got the new VDO catalog, and honestly, I want the gauges.  They have
a set, I cannot remember what they call it, but they describe them as '40's
or '50s style.  They have white background, with black markings, and the
pointers are a weather vane style:

                 )---&gt;
            (hey, gimmie a break, it's only ascii art)
and the bezels are chrome.  Now if I could only get my wife to cough up the
$400 for the speedo, 4 gauges, and senders, and mounting brackets, I'd be a
happy camper.
