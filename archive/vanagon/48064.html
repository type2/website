Argh!  I posted a long rant about this a month or two ago (on
vanagon_at_lenti).  I contend that there is no difference in accuracy between
the sump mounted sender and the dipstick one, and I'd be happy to argue why
I am so sure of this with anyone in person or on the phone.  I don't have
the energy to type it out again.  :)
