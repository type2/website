Hi everyone,

Yesterday I went to the local VW dealer to get a replacement cable for the 
side door on my 84 Vanagon.  It's been broken for a little while and I was 
glad to make time to fix it.   Ya know, the Minnesota winter must be taking 
it's toll on me because in  panic, I charged a replacement heater core for 
the heater under the back seat ($150 - ouch!)  That money was definitely not 
in the budget this month!  But I was in a state of panic, and couldn't stand 
the cold anymore.  After work  I replaced both the cable on the sliding 
door, and the heater in about 45 minutes.

WOW, what a difference it makes to have heat in my Vanagon.  The heater for 
the front of the van never did throw off much heat.  I've felt like I'm 
driving around in a  small drafty cave for the past two years.  Now that 
there is heat in the van, it feels like a modern vehicle.  Wow, it's really 
nice to have heat.  What a difference! Ya know, these Vanagons are OK....

Just had to tell someone.

TC
