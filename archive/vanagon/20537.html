Subject: Any musicians out there?
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 1995 14:57:53 GMT

There was a post back in November about generators making noise at
campsites. Then somebody mentioned a tuba. We like tubas. But we
really hate campers who use generators, and all other noise pollution
including loud stereos.

We just want to know if there are any other wind players out there.
Bob plays trombone in a brass quintet, and french horn in the local
community band.  Penny plays clarinet in the band, too. Four of our
children also play, and we have a family band (wind ensemble).

Sometimes on our epic road trips we bring along all the horns,
trumpets, and clarinets. We have rehearsed at a church or two that
would put up with our music making. But we haven't rehearsed or
concertized at a campsite.

Have any other wind players had the courage or gall to strike up the
band at a campsite?
