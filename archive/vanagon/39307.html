Subject: '82 vanagon rear wheel bearings

I feel rather stupid asking about rear bearings since I've watched a thread
go by without reading any of it, but here goes.

I've just got my diesel van running, and it needs a right rear bearing
BIGTIME, as in I get about .5&quot; of play when the car is jacked up.  Symptom
number two is that it produces more noise than a 1600 diesel motor.

I bought the bearings and seals already, but I have no Bentley manual (yet).
I've done lots of double taper roller bearings (mostly front wheels), and
some Rabbit straight roller bearings.

What am I faced with here?  I've got a Bentley for my '79 bus, but have
never &quot;done the procedure&quot;.  Is it similar enough?
