 David Kao,

 It isn't entirely clear to me what your agenda is. If you just want to get
 your Vanagon fixed, the outfit where I got my longblock &lt;AVP in Sacramento&gt;
 sells remanufactured Wasserboxer heads for $200 each. He says his best 
 mechanic can replace both heads on a watercooled Vanagon in 4 hours. With 
 gaskets, that job would add up to less than $800 if you were to have them
 do the work, right?

 If, on the other hand, you want to make VW suffer for their mistakes you
 will probably need to put something more like $2000 at risk while you fight
 with VWoA and deal with the arbitration of the class action settlement
 business. 

 Now for two grand, you could get into a nice breadloaf Westy that only leaks
 water from the sink...... oil is another matter however.


 On the subjec of oil, someone else posted about oil leaks from their early
 '80s Vanagon. Pushrod tube seals are a likely suspect and some folks say that
 replacing the stock parts with o-rings made out of Viton elastomer will stand
 the heat better. It they have been changed once and the leaks came back AND
 they are on the left side of a California car, it's time to become very
 suspicious of a clogged catalytic converter causing high temperatures in
 that area. Not dealing with a clogging/clogged converter can have disastrous
 consequences as regards engine overheating and it's subsequent damages:
 dropped seats, burned and broken valves and all that other nasty stuff.

 With the exception of the seal behind the flywheel, most of the other spots
 that leak &lt;oil cooler, seal behind fan, rocker cover gaskets, etc&gt; can be
 repaired with the engine in the car. Remember not to overtighten the sump
 nut though in an effort to stop a leak there. 9 ft-lbs max.! Overtightening
 that puppy will distort the center cam bearing journal. Replace the gaskets
 instead, a sump kit is just a couple bucks and there is only one nut to undo.
