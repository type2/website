Subject: Window screens or curtains

We bought a 1991 Vanagon GL and had signed the paper on the dotted line with
the expectancy of the curtains to be in the car and the damn dealer yipped
them before giving it to us.  The previous owner even told us to get the
curtains from them.  Dealers suck!!  Anyway, our new dilemma is trying to
find screens and curtains for our baby so we can camp in peace without the
nasty critters joining us.  We do not have a camper.  Also, is there a
curtain or screen that fits the rear if the hatch is open.  Any ideas and
suggestions would be much appreciated.  Peace, love and Volkswagons--Dan
