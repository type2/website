Subject: 1965 Westy Question

bear with me if this getting a bit redundant for you people out in netland,
the info-bahn or whatever other cheesy name you like.


can anyone explain what the numbers mean on the metal tag that is pop
rivted to the bulkhead behind the front passenger seat on my 1965
Westfalia?

Here are what the numbers on the tag look like

Ultimately I would like to find the original paint code for the bus (i.e.
an &quot;L&quot; number), basically i think i have the original paint narrowed down
to being either pearl white or Ivory (not 100% sure that if that is the
right name)
