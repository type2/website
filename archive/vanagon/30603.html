Subject: Holiday Trek II


I am getting my things together for my holiday adventure of driving
a 65 bus from Kansas City to Atlanta next week.  Last words from
Jon were &quot;sketchy steering, low engine power, probably ignition or
vacuum leaks&quot;.  Not encouraging words for a 2 day drive (under the
best conditions).

Would like to set up a network of people to call on between KC and
Atlanta for what looks like the inevitable at this point.  Hope to
leave KC on the 21st to head back to Atlanta.

Will be leaving Atlanta for Boston via Newark this Friday, the 15th.
Will be in NJ until eve of 16th if anyone there would like to get
together.  Same goes for Boston where I will be from the 17-20th.

&gt;From there I fly to KC &amp; the fun begins.  Carefully going through
tools to pick what I need &amp; shouldn't need.

Wish me luck...

Dave
