So David Schwarze says:

&gt; Okay Steve, it's too late to be condescending!  :-)  

Yep, I thought so.....  But I had to try... :)

&gt; Let's just say
&gt; that if I put *half* of the money into my bus that you spent on yours,
&gt; it would be all over your bus:
&gt; 
&gt; Paint Job &amp; Body Work       $2,000
&gt; Fix A/C                       $500
&gt; 2.7l Porsche six from W. K. $2,500
&gt; Heated seats, 200 watt alpine stereo w/ CD changer, alloy wheels, tinted
&gt; windows, new uphostery in back, etc. etc. etc.      $5,000

Oh David, your such a glutton for punishment... :]  It may cost less for
you to put all those goodies in your van (heated seat?).... But while 
you're doing all those installations, I'm driving mine.... ;p
