 &gt; Berry,
 &gt; I know you guys at parc are always ten years ahead of the rest of the world,
 &gt; but you've really outdone yourselves this time. give yourself a promotion 
and
 &gt; sell this idea to microsoft.

Well, we didn't actually invent it (though we do have an active Microwave 
Materials Modification group :-).  I first heard about on another  mailing 
list; the original article appears to be from Ivan Campbell _at_ LOTUSINT.  I'll 
append it because it's better written than my version (and because I finally 
found the folder I stored it in...)

Does this mean I don't get the promotion?

&gt; Hi Rich,
&gt; Here is a novel game that is guaranteed to shorten those long winter evenings !!
&gt; 
&gt; This is really something for a rainy/snowy day, so long as you're equipped
&gt; with the essentials.  What you need is a microwave oven, some grapes,
&gt; a small measure of sunflower oil and some friends with which to
&gt; compete.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is thus.  Firstly, if the microwave is of the type that has
&gt; one of those silly rotating dish-like things, which rotates your food
&gt; to make sure it gets cooked evenly, then TAKE IT OUT and THROW IT
&gt; AWAY.  You won't need it for this game and, if you get addicted
&gt; enough, you probably won't use your microwave for anything else, so
&gt; you won't need that dish thing ever again.  OK, next, lightly cover
&gt; the floor of the oven with a SMALL amount of sunflower oil.  Just
&gt; generally spread it about, to make a thin, lubricating layer, on  
&gt; which
&gt; a grape may skate about.  Try it with a practice grape to make sure
&gt; you've got it right.  Then, line up a number of grapes at one side of
&gt; the oven, with one grape corresponding to each player.  Important tip
&gt; here - MAKE SURE THAT THE END WITH THE HOLE IN IT IS POINTING AT THE
&gt; WALL.  This is really quite fundamentally important.  Next, lay bets  
&gt; -
&gt; or whatever - on your grape, that it will win/lose/finish in a
&gt; particular position or state/whatever.  Then, set the microwave to
&gt; full power, and switch on.  What happens is that the inside of the
&gt; grape heats up, liquifies, and acts as a jet propellant to push the
&gt; grape along the lubricated floor of the microwave as it shoots out  
&gt; the
&gt; hole at the back.  Thus, each grape travels with varying degrees of
&gt; speed and/or success across the floor.  The first to reach the other
&gt; side of the oven is judged to be the winner, or, failing this, the  
&gt; one
&gt; to travel the furthest.  Some grapes don't make it even this far, and
&gt; either shrivel up or explode messily on the starting line, but this
&gt; just adds to the fun.  Remember to switch off the microwave and  
&gt; remove
&gt; the competitors before replacing them for the next round.
&gt; 
&gt; The game can be varied according to players and their individual
&gt; tastes, like &quot;Stunt Grapes&quot; where the grape must perform a task like 
&gt; jumping over other grapes, etc. These, and other variations, should 
&gt; keep you and your friends amused for hours.
