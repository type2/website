Subject: Vanagon help.

Hi all.
First off, thanks to all the members of this list who have sent me advice on
my upcoming Vanagon puchase.  I will feel a lot more confident of judging the
condition of a Vanagon armed with this information.
So lets see, here's what I can recall:
- Cylinder head gaskets that leak coolant.
- Expensive components - esp. the exhaust &amp; cat / radiator fan.
- Some possibility of rust on the body. (lower lips of rocker panels &amp; spare
tire well)
- Difficult to source tires (expensive).
- Worn out fuel hoses.
- Power steering leaks - worn ball joints [expensive].
- CV joints worn out..
- Coolant leaks (radiator, pipes).
- Transmission fluid leaks.
One question - how will I tell if the engine needs a head job?  Does the
coolant leak into the cumbustion chamber (&amp; make steam), into the oil
passages (and destroy the engine) or just drips onto the ground (not too
serious)?  If it does need a head job - how difficult is this to do and how
much $?
Thanks again for all the help!
Cheers,   MIKE
