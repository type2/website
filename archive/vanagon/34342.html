The sky and the water are blue, and they both come pouring in.

I've written on this one before and got great response regarding the drain 
holes. After cleaning them twice, I'm still getting the shower. The roof 
gets alot of leaves and stuff up there and it's tough to get it out, 
especially from the front. I hooked up a tube to a funnel, then put the 
large end of the funnel on my shop-vac. This worked to pull stuff up and 
down from the drain holes. Coat hanger with a hook works, too.

Upon inspection of &quot;das sheibedach,&quot;  I found the left rear corner dips 
lower than where it's supposed to be. I looked around for simple adjustment 
screws fut found only mounting hardware.

Anyone know of an adjustment for the roof, and why (even with four clear 
drains) I still get swamped?
