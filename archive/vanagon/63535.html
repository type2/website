&gt;5. Now I have an intermittent cutting out during in-town driving.
&gt;I've read the archives on intermittent missing, and wonder if there is
&gt;anything anyone can add. This isn't the kind of cutting out that makes m=
e stop
&gt;by the side of the road.  It only lasts a second or so and then starts u=
p.  I

I had that problem in my '84.  Not the wait 20 minutes, then starts probl=
em.  =

It would just die at stop lights and start right back up.  Sometimes you =

could feel it die while driving but 2 seconds later it's own rolling woul=
d =

start the engine back up.  I fixed it by replacing the ground strap betwe=
en
the cylinder head and the engine compartment wall.  The old strap was a b=
it
frayed but otherwise looked ok...I guess it was just bad enough to cause
an intermittant problem.  Good luck.
