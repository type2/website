Subject: Re: 'roo bars?

Dieter,

On Fri, 9 Feb 1996, you wrote about fitting  'roo bars. 

As the name implies, they are very popular here in Australia for fending 
off wildlife and other animals which wander into the path of (usually) 
fast moving vehicles, particularly at night when they (the animals) have a 
habit of suddenly leaping out of the dark into the path of a vehicle.

But, as the name also implies, their limit of effectiveness is with animals 
about the size of a kangaroo. They are particularly good at keeping sheep 
(of which there are millions in Australia, many in unfenced paddocks) away 
from the bdywork in a collision. 

The problem with them is that if you hit anything bigger than a 'roo, the 
bar, unless it is of the size and weight normally attached to 
semi-trailer prime movers, will distort and bend back against the 
bodywork of the vehicle. So, if your bar is not strong enough, it may 
deflect too much and can actually cause more damage than a localised ding 
at the point of impact. 

There is a balance between strength and weight which is made easier if 
the bar is made from aluminium, as many of them are for cars and light 
commercial vehicles. The truck ones are usually made from steel.

If you intend your bar to bounce cattle or deer away, you'll need a 
bloody big one and the weight would probably be too much to 
consider.

However, I might make the observation that I lived small towns in the 
southern and western plains of NSW over a period of 8 years. In that time 
I did a lot of travelling in a Japanese diesel van (converted to a 9 seat 
bus), both night and day, (about 100,000 miles in all) and only once hit an 
animal (other than birds). It was a sheep and it rolled right under the front 
bumper, an occurence which would probably be repeated in a vanagon. The only 
drivers who get a real benefit from 'roo bars are those who do a lot of 
night driving on back roads at high speed.

I suppose what I'm saying is that, unless you plan on putting yourself in 
situations where you're likely to hit animals, the expense, both before 
and after a collision, may not be worth it.
