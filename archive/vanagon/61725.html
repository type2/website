Subject: Tire pressure for Yokos
Date: Mon, 23 Jun 1997 05:46:03 -0400 (EDT)

What tire pressure is recommened or being used by you Yoko users ?  I just
had a set installed and am wondering what the good setup is.  Maybe this
info is in the archives ?  I have not checked, sorry if it is and if it's
not it may be a good idea to make up a FAQ on the subject of tire
pressures for the different tires used by Vanagon drivers.

Cheers

Frank
