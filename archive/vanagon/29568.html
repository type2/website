Subject: uhhh, Sharan is here.

not your long lost cousin, the Van.  someone (Bill?) had posted that 
they weren't in the US yet. not sure if i read your post right tho, 
pretty quick on the delete key this a.m.

Saw one here in Bemidji.  Really.  but...

Bemidji is once again the site of VW (Chrysler and others too) Cold 
Weather Testing.  Losta new VWs running around.  i don't *think* the 
Sharan i saw was part of that but i'm not sure 'cause i didn't get a 
look at the license plate (the 'test' cars have a manufacturer plate).

On the subject of new VWs, they are making some awful colors on these 
test cars.  a Smurf Blue and a Gumby Green.  maybe it is a 
camoflage tactic to have us avert our eyes when the 'secret' cars 
drive by.

i'm not too interested in new non-van VWs (still have a 
irksome Jetta taste in my mouth) but they have a cute little 
convertible running around, not beautiful (imho) Miata-esque but 
something different from the standard fare.
