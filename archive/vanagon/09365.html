So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; well, since a couple of folks have mentioned it, i'll post it again and
&gt; make EVERYBODY suffer through it (cause you might just meet someone in the
&gt; grocery checkout lane who has a stalling vanagon, so there!):

Well, actually, when I'm in the grocery line I've yet to meet someone with
a stalling vanagon.  I usually get somebody just 'stalling' the grocery line 
for some stupid reason or other. ;)
