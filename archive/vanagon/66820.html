Subject:      A few questions

I just bought a 1991 Westfalia and need some advices on a few things:

1- What do I need to know before flushing the coolant and replacing it ?
Since I don't have the Bentley book, would you tell me where to start.
By the way, I know about the phosphate free collant that is needed.

2- Would anybody have a Bentley book for sale ?

3- When I stop the van or just put it on Neutral( 4 speed-Std
transmission) I sometimes hear a noise (metal) coming from
underneath...like something that sits back in place.This happens around
5 minutes after I turned off the ignition or put it on neutral while
still running. Could it be the transmission ? I find the transmission
works Ok though

4- Do somebody have an idea how much It would cost to have an air-cond
installed in van. Would you recommend it.
