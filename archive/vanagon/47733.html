Subject: Renting EV's in the Northeast

-- [ From: stevek * EMC.Ver #2.10P ] --


Does anyone know of a place that rents EVF in the Northeast? 
Preferable in Ct.  My wife and I and Waldo. our Cocolate lab, want to
go camping in Acadia  National Park in Maine.  We have been tent
camping for 30 years but would like to get off the ground.  I'm waiting
for VWoA to import a TDI EV.

Thanks for any info on 2 week rentals.
