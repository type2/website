&gt;I thought this book might be of interest to readers on this list.  I have
&gt;not seen it.  The full blurb is:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;541826 VOLKSWAGEN: A Week at the Factory. Photos by Peter Keetman.
&gt;Remarkable duotone images tell the story of the production process of the
&gt;'Peoples Car', from parts to assembly, in a pictorial paen to the
&gt;unpretentious little car that became a classic. 71 photos. 93 pages.
&gt;Chronicle. Paperbound Pub. at $12.95 $9.06&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The book is a remainder and is available from
