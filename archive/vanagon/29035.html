&gt;I am planning to add the second battery to my 87 westy in the near future.
&gt; How much do I have to modify the compartment behind the driver's seat to
&gt;accomodate the battery? 

I added a second battery in the driver's side compartment of my non-westy '87
Syncro.  No compartment modifications were necessary.

 Also, do you have to &quot;tie&quot; the battery down?

Absolutely, you should &quot;tie&quot; it down.  I clamped mine down using the same
type of bracket as found on the passenger's side. I didn't spend the money on
a VW bracket, but bought a generic bracket thing at a hardware store and cut
and bent it to be like the stock one.  I drilled a hole through the wheel
well and put through an 8mm dia bolt up from the bottom with a 13mm (wrence
size) nut on top to hold it in place.  Above the nut the bolt was long enough
to go through the bracket and another nut just like the stock setup.

&gt; I was
&gt;hoping to be able to put the battery in a plastic marine battery case.  Has
&gt;anyone found a decent battery that would fit in a plastic case and still fit
&gt;in this compartment?

I fail to see the usefullness of the plastic box.  The 1st battery lives fine
without it.

&gt; I do have swivel seats.

I don't.

&gt; How much should I expect the
&gt;dealer to charge me to set up this system?

An arm and 1/2 of a leg.

&gt; Finally, if I just put the batter

Batter? What is this a cooking mail-list?  :-)

&gt;in and the terminals touch the metal top of the compartment will I have a
&gt;problem?

YES!!!!!
Heed other's warnings on this.  One thing though.  I saw someone mention a
wooden sheet to insulate between the terminals and the cover.  This could be
a problem.  While DRY wood is a pretty good electrical insulator,  if it got
wet (who knows how) it could absorb the water (typical water is an excellent
conductor) which would create a short between the battery positive terminal
and the cover.  This would be BAD news.  I would stick with some sort of
plastic insulator, just to be on the safe side.
