&gt;It's also one of the two ingredients in a thermite reaction. If you think
&gt;burning a VW case is fun, you ain't seen nothin yet. You use a strip of
&gt;magnesium as a fuse, just to get a thermite reaction STARTED.
&gt;
&gt;And no, I'm not going to tell you what the rest of the reaction participants
&gt;are. Even I have limits. I will just point out, that thermite surpassed
&gt;even napalm as an antipersonnel weapon in 'Nam. 'nuff said.


ehhhh... i AM going to tell you what the reaction participants are cause you
all probably have alot of it on hand: RUST, along with powered aluminum
mixed together is thermite.  Ignite it with a strip of magnesium and you
have the hottest burning stuff available (2000 deg F, i think), burn holes
in cement, etc...
