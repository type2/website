Subject: Country Home Camper Co.

I was talking to the FLAP guy recently about the hardware on my pop-top (is
it VW hardware or standard hardware?). He asked me whether it was a Westfalia
or was the conversion done aftermarket. Well, I had always assumed there was
no difference. A brief check of the old paperwork reveals the conversion was
done by Country Home Campeer Co. of Oakland, Ca. I tried contacting them,
they appear to be out of business.
So, I have two questions....
 1) If I don't have a Westfalia, what do I have?
 2) Has anyone else a conversion by this company? (if so, I have further
questions about wiring up an auxilliary battery and so on)

puzzled,

Chris
'76 Westfalia?
