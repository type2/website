Subject: Re: $25,000 splits

A similar thing happended about five years ago in England.
I remember Triumph Stags going for 1 to 2000 pounds, then
within a year they were going for upto 25,000 pounds. Unlucky
for the people who bought them though, because they currently
sell for a few thousand again!

In a way I don't want my '64 Samba to be worth $25000 - it will
only get stolen like a BMW or Porshe.
