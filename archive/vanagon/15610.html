&gt;One of the inner CV joints from my Synchro is sitting on the kitchen counter.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.  Dan
&gt;

Yikes!  On the kitchen counter?  I would be dead before I could even check 
for wear! I'd be dinner!

About the wear ...  I dunno.  How much is a new one?  Is this one much worse 
than the other?  

I really out of my ballpark here, as the &quot;newest&quot; vehicle I've ever owned is 
a 1976.

Happy CV-jointing.
