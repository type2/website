&gt;	The ECU has been replaced, and the air/flow wiring harness has

&gt;place?  It seems that it might be related to the computer since when I 
&gt;turn it off and then on, the problem goes away for awile.  If any of you 
&gt;have any ideas about this or have experienced something similar, please 
&gt;help me.  Many thanks in advance.

The o2 sensor or a bad temp sensor will cause these symptons.  Loose
connections and bad grounds do the same.  Clean contacts of all plug in
connectors.
