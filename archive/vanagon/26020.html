(This is a repost to this list. I messed up the list address on my first 
attempt.) 

Terry,

In my previous post I referred to a 'doova'.

I just wanted to clear up that a doova is not a peculiar Australian 
device like didgeridoo or boomerang.

A doova is an important piece of technology that can't be described in 
any other way. In actual fact, doova is short for doovalackey. It is in 
the same class of equipment as a gizmo, a thingumabob, a thingumajig, 
just plain thingammy or a whatsit.

Hope that's clear now.

By the way, have you had any luck with your door lock?
