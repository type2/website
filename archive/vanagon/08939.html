&gt; Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to
&gt; drive it around yet, I am curious as to what the attitude of cops have
&gt; been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
&gt; often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
&gt; &quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

When I first got my bus (6 years ago) it looked just as bad as it does now
(i.e. peeling paint, dents, scratches).  One night I was working on it late
(about 10 pm) and took it out for a quick test.  I pulled into a (closed) 
Midas lot to make a carb adjustment and a cop saw me and came over with his
lights flashing.  I was dressed in old dirty clothes and had grease on
my hands, etc.  He looked at my license and registration and promptly
accused me of plotting to rob the Midas shop.  After I explained that I
was just stopping to adjust my motor, he gets out his ticket book.  I ask
what he is citing me for, and he says, &quot;No front license plate&quot;.  Then he
says, &quot;Well, I'd better check that you don't have it before I write you up&quot;
and he walks around to the front of the bus and observes at that time that
I had no front license plate (He had not been in front of the bus before).
Lucky bastard.  Then he writes me for no insurance too (I paid for that
for three years).  So make sure you get a nice looking bus or at least
have it 100% legal, and don't stop anywhere and you should be alright.  :/
