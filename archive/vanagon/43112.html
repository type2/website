Subject: Rust remover/preventative recommendations?

Hi All,
Having tried Extend last year on the various &quot;blossoms&quot;, applying touch 
up paint to them, and then watching them reemerge this year, I thought 
I'd poll the collective mind and see what, if ANYTHING, people have had 
good luck with.  (What, me run on?)

I remember seeing something about a 3M product that looked very 
expensive, but haven't seen it in the FLAPS.  Anyone know anything about 
this or other wonder cures?

Jack
