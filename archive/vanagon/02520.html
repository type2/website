Subject: Charles: Seat catalog?!?!
Date: Mon, 1 Aug 94 14:57:59 EDT

According to Armstrong, Charles L.:

&gt; The only catalog I have handy shows $13.95 for a foam bottom seat pad for a 
&gt; '79
&gt; Bus. Just to give you an idea.

What catalog is this???  Sorry I'm so new at this, I've finally got up the
nerve to do some work on the bus, so I don't have any idea who makes seat
cushions or other parts for that matter (except VW themselves).  Also,
does anyone have an address where I can send for such a catalog??  I'd
like to find ones that have parts for all aspects of bus repair
(interior/exterior and engine and mechanical workings).  Thanks a bunch!!

Ken
Movin' right along...
