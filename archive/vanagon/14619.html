So, Joachim sez:

Sig for the day:

&quot;And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up on high,
saying, 'Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou
mayest blow thy enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'  And the Lord
did grin, and people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and
carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and
fruit bats, and large --&quot;

Two points for him/her wot knows wot this came 

And the answer is...
	MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL!

The sig is a quote from Brother Maynard's reading from the Book of 
Armaments, as Arthur and the knights are facing the killer rabbit 
outside the cave. It continues something like-

	&quot;First shalt thou take out thy pin. Then shalt thou count to 
three- no more, no less. Three shall be the number of the counting, 
and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not 
count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to 
three. Five is right out. At the number three, being the third 
number reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch 
toward thy foe, who being not in my sight shall snuff it.&quot;

	Or something like that. 

	Happy Motoring,
