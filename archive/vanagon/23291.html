Whew, that's it. 47 total, unless I have mis-counted. Sorry if I
misspelled your name, but doggone it, write neater!
:)
Hopefully this is everyone that sent in an order. If you sent in a
check, please tell me NOW. I will check the mail tonight, but that's it.
As I am terribly poor, I can't afford to order any extras. 
Anyway, I hope that's taken care of everything, and everyone. I'll let
you know when they are done, and I am mailing them out.
Thanks everyone.
Richard
