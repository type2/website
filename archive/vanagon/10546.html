&gt; PS: Hey Dave K.! '75 beat '74 busses 5:4. Nya, nya, nya... :-O

  I saw that and was hoping you wouldn't notice. What's a guy to do? Maybe
  it's time I moved up &lt;?&gt; to F.I. and got a '75 for myself. BTW, what makes
  you think that the engine would run cooler with F.I.? I agree with all the
  claims of driveability improvement but I don't understand the engine temp.
