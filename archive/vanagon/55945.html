Subject: repair of leaky water pump tank

On my 85 Westy, the black plastic resevoir that houses the faucet/pump
in the sink leaks.  I can't find a replacement plastic housing, called
the tank, because the part is discontinued.  I certainly don't want to
pay $200 for a new faucet/pump.

Any ideas?

Thanks
Don
