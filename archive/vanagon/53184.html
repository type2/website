Subject: what is under the passengers feet? (subwoofer mounting)

Volks,
	After much thought and many hours of crappy sounding music, I've
finally purchased a subwoofer for my van.  I don't really listen to loud
music (mostly bluegrass, really), and I already have a pretty good
stereo and speakers, but any bass I could hear at a stoplight went away
with the highway noise--you know how it is.  This subwoofer is a small
one, a six and a half inch round tube about 19 inches long that will fit
under the glove box in my 90 camper without really intruding on any leg
room (my girlfriend has short legs).  Its made by SAS Bazooka (stupid
name) and sounds great.  Anyway, I need to mount it to the floor and
before I do, I wanted to find out if I was going to damage anything by
shooting some sheet metal screws thru the floor under the glovebox.  To
give you some idea of where I'm thinking doing this, it would be about
toe level of anyone with their legs stretched out, maybe hidden from the
line of sight by the bottom of the glove box.  Anyone know whats under
there or if I'll screw anything up?

TIA.

	By the way, I've looked into all kinds of possibilities for improving
the low-end of the music spectrum in that van.  I put a wedge subwoofer
behind the drives seat (not really enough room to sound really good),
boxes between the front seats (takes up too much space, although one
might make a nice console if cupholders were added), under the back seat
(too muffled and took up too much storage space), on the floor in front
of back seat (too noticable to would-be theives). And any speakers
mounted in the doors just can't deliver the low-end.  So I finally
decided on this SAS Bazooka tube.  Its has an 80 watt amp built in and
was very easy to hook up (5 wires) and is rather inconspicuious under
the glove box--and will be even more so with a little carpet thrown over
it.  I don't have any connection with this company or anything, but for
some of us I know music is important and I thought I'd pass this little
gem along.  Cost me $300.

Ian
