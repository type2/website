Subject: Re: EGR for aircooled vanagon

So Brian M. Miller says:
&gt; I just read a posting that implied that an aircooled vanagon operating without
&gt; EGR would overheat and fail prematurely.  Is this true?  I recently purchased a
&gt; 1980 vanagon (if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it) and
&gt; the previous owner removed the EGR.  If this is potentially fatal I want to 
&gt; know and restore the EGR.  

The removal of the EGR valve can potentially be dangerous to your valves.
What Dennis H. was talking about is that if you remove the EGR, and don't
plug the holes and retime your engine to compensate, you may burn your
valves due to the excess air causing a leaner air/fuel mixture.  I believe
this can be defeated by plugging the left-over holes and adjusting the 
timing a little to richen the air/fuel mixture.  This will take a little
experimenting, but it can be done.

Now if you're in California, the may keep you from passing the emission in-
spection if the technician is knowedgable enough to look for an EGR valve.

&gt; how to get the parts?  I don't know what I am looking for.  Recommendations for
&gt; a knowledgeable used (?) parts dealer who could walk me through the required
&gt; pieces over the phone?

Well, you can look in the wrecking yards and pull one from a donor vehicle
or you can spend ~$150 for a new one from the dealer.
