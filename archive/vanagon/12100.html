Subject: What Happens If Gerry Dies?

I was at the place that Gerry set up in Cyberspace to store all our posts
and stuff. 

Now that I understand it better it is an incredible resource. I saw articles
by myself and others there. And I saw a gigantic FAQ file and other cool
stuff, including archives from the Vanagon list since its inception about
3/4s of a year ago. 

I bet fewer than a quarter  the people on the list have been to that site or
realize what gems it contains. 

But my real question is this, what if Gerry goes under his Vanagon and his
jackstands fail? Or what if he gets fired from his edu cause he thinks about
VWs too much? Or what if the US Congress cuts all the edu's budgets and they
have to cut out all those freeloading sites put up there by fantatics in
love with some specialty? 

We need to have a back up place to store all this treasure somewhere else in
case an ill wind blows across the cold plains of the northern midwest. 

I bring this up cause I found myself actually contemplating trying to
download the whole thing onto my hard drive just in case the site should go
poof some day.
