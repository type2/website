Subject: Re: oil filter wrench


Ryco (of Australia) make an oil filter for T4 motors which have a piece 
of sheet metal shaped into of a large nut and spot welded to the bottom of 
the filter.  This allows the use of a crescent wrench or similar to get the 
filter on and off. 

These filters are convenient but I have to admit that I don't use them
anymore as there are other brands available (without the nut) that are 
cheaper and of higher quality. 

To get the normal ones on and off, I use a 1cm thick steel bar about 
20cm in length bent into an 'L' shape with a 1.5cm groove cut down the top
of the 'L', and a piece of 1.5cm wide webbing sewn into loop a larger than
the circumference of the filter (2-3cm slop). 

To use, I place the webbing around the end of the filter, slide the grooved 
end of the bar onto the edge of the webbing and twist the bar on it's own 
axis in the direction I want the filter to turn.  The webbing pulls tight 
and grips the filter, and with continued force, will turn the filter. I don't 
tighten them down very hard because a) they're only supposed to be hand tight 
and b) it's not hard to crush the filter casing.
