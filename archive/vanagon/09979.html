Subject: Bleeding cooling system



Has anyone tried modifying a coolant resevoir cap to allow pressurization
of the cooling system? Maybe a bicycle floor pump and presta/schrader
valve assembly on a spare cap would work to determine if there are any leaks?
A low cost leak-down test?
Just a thought.

Alistair
