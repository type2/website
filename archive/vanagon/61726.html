Subject: Cool Yellow Headlight Lenses

To All,

Here (USA) I occasionally see a car with yellow headlight lenses, often
a mercedes, and I know this car is from Europe.

I'd like to replace my 91 Carat high beam lenses with yellow european
lenses, if such a thing can be had. I know it is probably &quot;illegal&quot;, but
I don't really care.

This list has to be THE place to ask: anybody know if this part exists?

Thanks,
-- 
Ed Gurney
