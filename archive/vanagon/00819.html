Subject:       help GM alternator in a 74 1800?

When I bought my 74 (1800 dual carbs) van last year the alternator 
did not charge.  I removed it it was a GM AC DELCO.  I replaced it 
with one similar that I got for free.  It worked great till yesterday 
(only about 1000 miles later).  Do these GM alternators not withstand 
the heat in this situation so close to the exhaust or what?  I may 
have the wiring wrong.  Or it may have been wrong when I bought the 
van.  There are three wires 1.  Bolts to alt housing (feild 
windings?) then two wires from a clip 1.  for juice from the 
alternator (already regulated to approriate voltage 14.2 volts).  And 
the other line runs the idiot light.  The line to the field windings 
I think should only be supplied with juice while the key is on and 
the line from the clip should go right to the battery.  Am I right?  
Has anyone any experience with this set up?  Thanks in advance for 
any inputs.
