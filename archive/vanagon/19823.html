Subject:      Liquid wrench OD and that stupid shock absorber



Thanks for responding with a few suggestion. The problem is the bottom bolt
holding on the rear right shock. I got the nut off, it was a 17mm, but the
bolt, a 19 mm, will not budge--#_at_%*_at_--. I tried using my breaker bar, I even
pulled out my old bent torque wrench I bent a few years ago on a rear shock of
a bug, but no go. The space is limited so I can't get a lot of leverage. I
tried pounding from the nut side, it will not slide-- The idea of heat is
interesting. There is a lot of metal surrounding that bolt, I would have to go
out and get a butane torch. Surely it wouldn't cost more than paying to have
the suckers put in, I man I hate to give in. I'm alot of years from that air
compressor and that impact wrench, and man it wore me down workin that bolt.
What do you think, could heat work on that much metal, and wouldn't it make
the hole the bolt is in tighter?

Tim
