&lt;&lt; There was also a special edition Wolfsburg Westy Weekender that was sold
 exclusively in Worland, WY.  Since Worland is located in Washakie County,
 this edition would be called the Worland Washakie Wyoming Wolfsburg Westy
 Weekender, or just WWWWWW for short.  :)  &gt;&gt;

I just remembered the special edition made for sale only in Walla Walla
Washington.  Of course the city Walla Walla being in Walla Walla county the
vehicle would be called the Walla Walla Walla Walla Washington Wolfsburg
Westy Weekender or jus the WWWWWWWW for short!   :)
