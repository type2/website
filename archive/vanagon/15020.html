&gt; The information I have on the Farmington, NC IVWA show is for Sunday
&gt; April 9.  Since there seems to be some confusion about the date, does
&gt; someone know for sure what the actual date is?
&gt; 
The actual date is Sunday, April 9. However, I think several of us are
going up Saturday, the 8th, in the evening, to camp out so as to be
there at 9 or so when they open up.
