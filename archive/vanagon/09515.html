&gt;BTW -- is anyone in SoCal familiar with the Twentynine Palms
&gt;area?  I haven't been there in years, but it sounds like a 
&gt;desert area which would be moderatly close to both the NoCal
&gt;and SoCal people, which the four of us in Zonie-Land could 
&gt;make as well!

Last time I was in 29 Palms, I saw this derelict gas station with both
a split window bus and an early 911 &quot;abandoned&quot; in its side yard.
