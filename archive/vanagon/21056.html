Subject: heat riser, jumping tranny

I got the crew cab home this weekend and the heat riser tube on the dp 
manifold is rusted thru and broken on the left side.  Is there a way to fix 
this or do I need a new manifold.  I know this is important for 
driveability, warmup, etc, so I want to have it working.  

Can the stock, cheap beetle mufflers be used on '68-'71 type 2s?

Also, what causes the trans to jump out of fourth gear when it gets worn.  
What parts need to be replaced to fix this.  It would be nice to have it 
right instead of using the bungee method, although the bungee method is 
probably much cheaper.

Just starting to learn about type I powered breadloafs.

TIA,
Dean
