&gt; ======== Original Message ========
&gt; I need a distributor for a 91 vanagon carat....mine has bad bushings
&gt; which is causing it to miss most of the time on some cylinders
&gt; ..cutting into right side of the cap contacts..while carboning up the
&gt; left side....alot of new cap contact gold dust on the bottom...
&gt; Does anybody have a good one to sell??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks John Matchet
