&gt;
&gt; so, as a standing offer, anyone on the list planning on driving
&gt; through portland, drop me a line and i'll meet you somewhere, take you
&gt; to silly restaurant, buy you a beer and show you a pretty view
&gt; somewhere.  i'll even tell at least one funny story.  then you can say
&gt; at least one nice person lives there. or, roll up your windows and
&gt; blow on through.  either way...
&gt;
&gt; take care all,
&gt;       brandy&gt;
&gt;
...heck, i'll match that offer for oregon's south coast ! you come thru
the &lt;Coos&gt; Bay Area, you let me know ! take you crabbing or clamming or
tidepoolin' or somethin'...got beer here too...
