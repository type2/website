&gt;Subject: Intermittant loss of power
&gt;
&gt;I have a 90 westfalia that about once a month or so loses power after
running about 2 miles. It will slow right down and stall. i can always start
it right up again and it will run oK at an idle but backfire and stall if
given any gas. It will do this for maybe about 2 minutes then as it gets a
bit warmer it runs fine again an the problem may not happen again for weeks.
I have checked for bad grounds but all looks fine . I would be grateful for
any suggestions. thanks in advance.


I wanted to thank the many respondants E Miskow,Joel Walker, T Bill,
Lawrence Johnston, Ken Lewis, Joe Wagner, Don Gibbons and David Katsuki. The
suggestions were
great and so much more helpful than my local dealer who had no suggestions.

Suggestions were:

Put in a special noise reduction harness between the air controland the
normal connector. This was a good idea and had been done already by the PO.

Check the connections to the temperature sensors and/or replace the two
temperature sensors which did fix one similar case.

Three suggestions to check the oxygen sensor and i think THATS IT.

It has taken me all this time cause the problem is sooo intermittant. But it
did fail one day and immediately got better when I unplugged the oxygen
sensor. I ran for a month with the sensor unplugged and no problems. I just
replaced the oxygen sensor with the $49 one from Ron Salmon and all still
seems OK. I will have to go for a couple of error free months to be sure so
I will let you know. Many thanks again for all the help. This really is a
very supportive and helpful group.
I'm proud to be a part of it. (Actually I'm the gratefully getting help
part.)
