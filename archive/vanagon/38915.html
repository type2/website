John, 

A few weeks ago, Bob Hoover gave a pretty detailed description about 
wiring up some lights and a 'silver socket' in the engine bay. 

I think I kept it so if you can't find it in the archives, get back to me 
and I'll see if I can send you a copy.

I have a '72 bus with one of those computer analysis plugs. I fitted 
and wired up some little $2.00 interior lights from K-Mart, as well as a silver 
socket, and they simply plug into the power connection on the computer 
plug. I earthed the lights and the socket straight to the body. 

It's really great to have some light in the engine bay, particularly at 
night when you're in the middle of nowhere.

I realise now that I should have a fuse wired into this little set up so  
that's one of the things I'll be doing during this Easter break.

That is when I'm not at the Australian Hillclimb Championships (motorised 
variety) at Mt Panorama, Bathurst this weekend. There are some excellent 
and very competitive VWs and VW powered open wheelers. There's also an 
amazing bay window bus that tows one of the race cars which should be there. 
It's the fastest bus in Australia. It's 2.2l, aircooled, turbo charged 
and intercooled. It has three cooling fans, two of which are electric.
