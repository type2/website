Subject: Re: How do I lower my late model?

&gt;I have a 1969 type II single cab pick up, it has a mild resto custom look,
&gt;and I would now like to lower it a bit (3-4inches), any advice on what method
&gt;is best, cost, and who has the parts would be greatly appreciated.  Drop
&gt;spindles would be my first choice if anyone makes them for a late model (I've
&gt;only seen them for early),  Thanks!


 Possible solutions:

 1. deflate tires (free)
 2. take tires off (free)
 3. take wheels and tires off (free)
 4. dig a hole 3-4 inches and drive bus to it (free)
 5. move somewhere else which is 3-4 inches lower than where you live (cost
depends on location)
 6. add seat booster which is 3-4 inches higher so the bus feels lowered
(about $20 for a good one)
 7. get 4 roller skates and install where tires go (about $90 and tie shoe
laces good)

 If you need more possibilities, just let me know. Glad to be of assistance.
