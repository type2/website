so i put a new stereo in the beast yesterday.  home built kicker box,
nice amp, nice head, reasonable three ways.  sound good. sounds good.
sounds good!!!! [say that to yourself, it won't make any sense after a few
repititions...kinda like 'egg']  anyway i'm getting interference.  there's
a high wistle from the tweeters that follows engine rpm.  how do i make it
go away?
