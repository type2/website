Subject: Shop Troubles Update

Ok,

	Well, my SO wrote a letter to the shop that hosed her BMW, stating
(in effect) 

	A) I'm pissed
	B) My car is hosed beyond belief
	C) You mechanic stinks and I wouldn't trust him to change a lightbulb.
	D) I've asked VISA to withold payment until futher notice (which they did)

	The shop owner called her back, and she and he set up a meeting with
me, my SO, the mechanic, and himself to try to work this
thing out.

	I'm wondering if we should take it to an independent shop first, in
order to have something to back up our claim that they've hosed the
car, or should we wait 'til after the meeting.  The meeting is 
next Tuesday, so it is kinda short notice.  Plus, I wonder if she should
drive the car to a shop or not.  She hasn't driven it since she
got it out of the shop last time.


Any feedback would be appreciated.

Thom
