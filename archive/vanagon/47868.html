    Try this...as your driving and it's running bad, turn off the 
    ignition switch for 1 second. If it runs good for the next 15 
    seconds or so, you have a computer problem: temp. sensor, O2,
    etc.   IF there is no change check the cap, rotor, of igition
    wires.

&gt; Hey guys!  I need help!  My '85 GL acts up every time it rains.  When you go
&gt; out in the morning after an evening rain it either will not start or starts
&gt; but spits and sputters and won't move for a few minutes.  This morning (after
&gt; heavy thunderstorms last night) my wife started it up and got two blacks from
&gt; home when it started doing its thing.  This time, however, it did not quit.
&gt;  I just spent an hour trying to get it to go, with no luck.  It will idle
&gt; very roughly, but when you give it gas you can here what sounds like a
&gt; flapper valve shutting and it chokes.  Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; My wife is getting fed up and if I don't solve this problem soon Big Blue may
&gt; have to go.  Hate to see that happen.  Thanks.
