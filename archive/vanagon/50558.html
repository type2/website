Subject:       CV joints/axles- new vs. rebuilt?

This does not actually apply to a bus, but the answers should apply 
to a buses...

My 85 Jetta has one CV which is still original out of 3, and is 
starting to go - loud knocking on acceleration. It is not affected by 
turning the wheel, which leads me to suspect the inner joint, 
although I though I had replaced it already. Is this the correct 
diagnosis?

2nd question is more general: I can get new Lobro CVs for about $90 
ea, or I can get a rebuilt axle with 2 new joints and boots for $126, 
made by Etna &lt;sp?&gt;. Anyone heard of this company? Since a boot will 
cost me $10-15, the $126 for the whole deal sounds pretty good...

Any experience with these types of axles would be appreciated.Shawn Wright (VWnut_at_smus.bc_dot_ca)
