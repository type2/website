The first post on this thread was from:

More stuff on this list (like the present message) is a true waste of
internet resources.  *I* am offended by stuff like this appearing on
a list that is already so chatty.  The way to stop this is to send
Ms. Zinini the messages expressing your feelings.  She is probably not
on the mailing list, so all of the vitriolic responses to the list don't
do much good.  

The *real* way to get spammers to clean up is to bombard their host with
messages as well.  She posted this from &quot;interamp_dot_com&quot;, which actually
sounds like a business.  Sending mail to root_at_interamp_dot_com or to
sysadmin_at_interamp_dot_com with complaints is probably more likely to be
effective.  I hate these kind of login names -- makes me think that
the folks at the source are not longtime internet folks (remember when it
was darpanet?), and they seem to be well meaning, if naive users in the
main.

Your mail only went to the vanagon list -- the originator of this message
is probably blissfully unaware that it caused such furor.  Im my search
of the messages this generated, none that were sent to the list were also
sent to her, either on the CC or the To: lines.  She sent one piece of
spam, and the listmembers (including me, today) have magnified this with
a dozen or so time-wasters.

Please, Please, Please -- don't respond to things like this to the list --
send them to the source.
