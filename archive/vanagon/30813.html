&gt;Hello,
&gt;	I have a '73 camper van with a window wash resivoir that won't

Hey Charlie,  have you tried replacing the valve on the air fill for your
torpedo?  My '71 Westy's wahsers went south and that was the problem with
mine.  As for using the spare... it would be like the old beetle dilemna,
where if you squirt your windshield too much, and then you have a flat, you
are left with a flat spare because of this.  I suppose if you kept up on it
it wouldnt happen, but left up to me.... well... What i did with my '73
Beetle was to take the torpedo sysstem from my parts bus and install it on
the Beetle.  Works great.  Well good luck
