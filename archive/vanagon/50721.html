Subject: 84 Vanagon: Would you fix if it yourself (if you were me?)

The engine is running very rich during idle and haphazardly hesitates to
accelerate from a stop.  These symptoms have resulted in.

1.      hesitation from stop to first
2.	hesitation from first to second (happens less frequently than #1)
3.	high hydro carbon emissions readings
4.	high carbon dioxide emissions readings
5.      very bad gas mileage.  

Dealer stated that it'll cost $320 total for the fix...  I have some
questions on the dealer's proposef fixes.
1.      sticking throttle valve ($6.00 cleaner &amp; brush, 118.00 labor) 
        Q: Can just anyone find this throttle valve and clean it?  How
hard is it to locate and remedy?

2.      seeping (seaping?) fuel line #3 ($22.00 parts, 78.00 labor)
        Q: Not yet leaking, but at this point seeping.  Any dangers in
replacing this thing?  

3.      $79.00 Diagnosis fee

Main questions:  If you were me (a person who's not really too
knowledgeable yet... book's on the way from KevinS though... would you
tackle this project yourself and be able to do it in 1 to 2 hours? with
minimal danger?  Kind of worried about the fuel line since fire and fuel
equals possible boom :-)  

More stats on &quot;me&quot;:
1.      Can do oil changes on the 84 vanagon... woohoo
2.      replaced the coolant reservoir myself!
3.      replaced alternator myself! 
These are the extent of my minimal expertise.  Can I perform the first
(throttle valve) and second (fuel line) myself?

Thanks y'all!

John
