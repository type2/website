&gt; and now, we shift over to our Weekly Lesson in Autombile History and
&gt; Lore: this is what the well-dressed bus-driver is driving these days:
&gt; 
&gt;   56 Microbus    1    68 Bus    5    80 Vanagon    4    92 Eurovan    0
&gt;   57 Microbus    0    69 Bus    4    81 Vanagon    8    93 Eurovan    8
&gt;   58 Microbus    2    70 Bus    7    82 Vanagon   13    94 Eurovan    0
&gt;   59 Microbus    1    71 Bus   10    83 Vanagon    5    95 Eurovan    0
&gt;   60 Microbus    2    72 Bus    9    84 Vanagon   10
&gt;   61 Microbus    3    73 Bus    8    85 Vanagon   14
&gt;   62 Microbus    1    74 Bus    4    86 Vanagon    5
&gt;   63 Microbus    1    75 Bus    2    87 Vanagon   14
&gt;   64 Microbus    3    76 Bus    5    88 Vanagon    3
&gt;   65 Microbus    0    77 Bus    7    89 Vanagon    4
&gt;   66 Microbus    6    78 Bus    9    90 Vanagon    9
&gt;   67 Microbus    4    79 Bus    4    91 Vanagon    6


	Reading this, I suddenly remembered that I inherited a '55 bus in 1974
	for taking care of a friend's dogs for a few months.

	It was painted like a big American flag and it had a 1300 engine in it
	which required the teeth to be ground off the flywheel making for
	the only hand-crank start '55 for many miles, I'm sure. 

	And, it was a sure bet to impress folks
	sitting near the windows in cafe's in Alfred, New York to see me
	open the rear hatch, flip a toggle (ignition), mount the homemade
	crank through that stock keyhole and make it start on first try.

	Needless to say, it was a tad cool inside in that upstate NY winter.

	It lost its' brakes on a downhill and was transformed into a chicken
	coop.
