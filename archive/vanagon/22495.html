Subject: New extractor installed. Problems.

The scoop:
'71 Bus with 1600 DP setup. 34PICT3 carb, low compression (7.0),
stock everything else.

I busted the muffler off a couple of weeks ago, and have been trying
to fix it. A buddy of mine pulled an old bugpack muffler out of
the closet, saying it did not fit his new engine, as the
stroker pistons moved the heads too much. Well it fit mine, so I slapped
it on there.

Well, now the bus seems to top out the powerband at around 
3000 rpm. I thought that an extractor (over the stock m,uffler)
would increase top end, not lessen it. I used to be able to turn 45 with
no trouble, but shortly.

What should I do here. It feels like it is having troubles
holding 50 MPH, and I get a bad snap-crackel-pop-Boom coasting
down a hill in 2nd, overdriving the engine. (Means lean, right)
Also increased my oil temp about 20 degrees on the short run
I took yesterday.

What jet sizes are people running with this setup? I want torque,
but I gotta be able to get 4000 RPM to make 60 MPH. Any slower around
here, and Im a traffic hazard. And I have heard that some upsizing 
of the jets are required when switching to an extractor. And I gotta
keep the temp down, even if I have to run a little rich to do it.

Thanx.

BTW, I was at the pub and met a guy that works for VA dept. of Trans.
He said he can get 25 gallon cans of relective highway paint. Im
gonna try to 'buy' some off him and mabye paint the white bumpers
on the bus with it. Should be visible at night then. If it works,
Ill do the whole top of the car. Ittl 'glow' at night.
