&gt; If you are going to go on a trip, you should at least create a banner and
&gt; shirt patches with some odd logo on it...  and what about a mascot?

I have a plec..., er, I never could spell that. I have a fish named &quot;Bert&quot;
that would be a good mascot. He looks like a catfish, he's a scum-sucking
bottom-feeder, and he's been around forever.
