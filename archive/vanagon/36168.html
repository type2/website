So Mark Janello says:
&gt; Anyway, I went to fill up with gas the other day, first time since the fix.
&gt; Expected to put 8 or so gallons in after having gone 80 miles (it's been
&gt; cold, and I take short trips), but only needed 4.
&gt; 
&gt; So hurray for that but boohoo for the past few months where I've been
&gt; getting 10mpg and thinking it was just that it was cold.  I'll do a
&gt; compression test and post the results, hope they're not too scary.

I think you'll find your compression is just fine.  The bad spark plugs
are what was causing bad gas mileage.
