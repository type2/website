Tom,
       Can you please foward this info to the list, as I'm still banished
from Ken's world thanks.

       Camping for all interested before the show in Bloomington-Normal, Suds
1st BUGFEST will be at the Yogie Bear in Goodfeild Il. I reserved one big
section with atleast 35+ camp sites. This is the last camp-out this season in
the mid west.
         SO DON&quot;T MISS OUT ON THE FUN!!!!!!
  A contest for &quot;Grooviest campsite&quot; will be held Saturday, and Bon-fire
Saturday night, so don't forget that old 40hp case or gutted trans.
        Also on Sunday morning all interested are going to caravan to
breakfast than on to the show.
        Yogie Bear is located off of rt 74 exit #112 in Goodfeild IL. phone
