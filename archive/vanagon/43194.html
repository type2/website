The temp sender is not nearly as large as the pressure sender. On my engine 
at least, it fits nicely in the circular recession for the drain plug. 
Nothing much hangs down below that. Plus the syncro has additional steel 
members protecting the bottom of the engine. I guess the connecting wire 
could catch something and get pulled off if you were driving in heavy brush 
or something.
