&gt;Part of a column by Robert Pease [an EE who writes a regular column for
&gt;Electronic Design]. Thought you might enjoy it....
&gt;
&gt;-----------
&gt;
&gt;Just what kind of car do you drive, Pease, to get good reliability? Ah,
&gt;yes. I drive a car with exactly the right amout of modern electronic,
&gt;computerized equipment--a 1968 VW beetle [my wife drives a newer car,
&gt;a 1969 Beetle].
&gt;
&gt;Now, as an engineer, I suppose I should say good things about all of
&gt;the fancy electronic fuel injection and spark computers and diagnostic
&gt;computers and Lambda sensors. But I get 31 mpg and the car goes just as
&gt;fast as I want, and that's good enough for me. The bottom line is that
&gt;I prefer a car that has proven itself by running reliably for 336,000
&gt;miles. In fact, until a couple months ago, it was still running on the
&gt;original engine, and the original crank and pistons and cylinders
&gt;[though it's true I had replaced the cylinder heads].
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes I do connect a Heathkit electronic ignition system to minimize
&gt;wear and tear on the breaker points. But right now it's on the blink, so
&gt;I just went back to the old conventional [Kettering] ignition system,
&gt;points and coil and distributor and &quot;condenser.&quot; I set my own timing and I
&gt;adjust my own valves. That's one good thing about old, simple cars--if
&gt;something does go wrong [which is rarely] you can fix it yourself.
&gt;
&gt;Do I think that electronics systems are going to improve the reliability
&gt;of vehicles? Well, maybe. I recall the story of one of the first trucks
&gt;that had an anti-lock brake system. They were driving innocently down the
&gt;road when a nearby driver keyed the transmitter on the CB radio and the
&gt;truck immediately locked up all the brakes. It turned out somebody had
&gt;decided it would hurt the reliability to add bypass capacitors across the
&gt;sensors and the inputs of the sensor amplifiers.
&gt;
&gt;That's what you learn from MILHDBK-217..remember? So when the transmitter
&gt;went on, all of the amplifiers went berserk. Oh, the *amplifiers* were
&gt;perfectly &quot;reliable,&quot; but the system had not been engineered properly. It
&gt;was a miracle that nobody was behind the truck when it locked up all its
&gt;brakes.
&gt;
&gt;Are the new electronic systems better for the environment? Maybe so. Maybe
&gt;a new sedan can travel down the road emitting even less smog and emissions
&gt;than my VW, so long as its computer is working right. But in 10 years,
&gt;what happens when you can't get parts for the computerized systems? My
&gt;car will still be running just fine. I think I'll stand pat.
&gt;
&gt;After all, I have all of the tools and techniques I need to keep old VWs
&gt;running forever. Forever? Well, there are old VWs around here that are over
&gt;35 years old, and if I can keep my good new beetles running 35 more years,
&gt;they may outlive me. You would not want to bet that I can't keep them
&gt;running. Meanwhile, if I see another VW broken down along the road, I stop
&gt;and see if I can help.
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes I have a tool or a gallon of gas, or the spare part they're in
&gt;need of--a fan belt, or some points, or a clamp for a fuel hose. So I try
&gt;to help solve their problem.............
