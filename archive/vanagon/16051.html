Subject: Re: New starter?+wierd noise (help!)


&gt;Hmmmm...   I've had an irritating and intermittent starting problem in my 
&gt;76 Westy for the last while.  Sounds the same as what Richard describes: 
&gt;turn key, idiot lights at dask ok, but NOTHING (no click, even) from 
&gt;starter.
&gt;POSSIBLE RELATED SYMPTOM?
&gt;
&gt;On the way back, starting around the Mississippi, I noticed a humming, 
&gt;mid-frequency vibration noise from the rear of the car.  Sorta like one 
&gt;of those harmonic frequency things, couldn't isolate which side of the 
&gt;car it came from.  At first only occured at highway speeds (45-55 mph).
&gt;
&gt;As the trip continued, noise got gradually louder, to the point thathe 
&gt;noise developed dropped too: now it's noticeable at city speeds (30 mph), 
&gt;and occaisionally, there is a grinding, squeaking noise (oouuch!!!) at 
&gt;very slow speed (&lt; 10 mph).
&gt;
&gt;When I lay into the throttle a bit, the noise almost disappears.  Steady 
&gt;speed or backing on the engine makes it very noticeable.  Putting the 
&gt;clutch in does not make it go away or change the sound substantially. 
&gt;
&gt;Ideas?  Huh?  Could both the starting prob and this humming, vibrating 
&gt;harmonic kinda noise be related?

This may sound far fetched at first but I think your problems *could*
be related.  A couple of weeks ago I was driving my '66 Westy and began
to notice an awful grinding sound coming from my engine compartment.
I pulled over and turned my ignition switch off.  Guess what happened.
The starter was turning over.  Took the key out.  The starter continued
turning over.  Went to disconnect the negative battery terminal and it
was *HOT*.  Beat starter solenoid with a hammer, no help.  Cleaned all 
the contacts, no help.  

Decided to chance frying the starter and drive home (10 miles).  Pulled
the starter and tested it, worked fine.  Put another starter I had in
the garage in the bus &amp; it did the same thing.  I've decided that the
old ford solenoid I have in there was toasted or the ignition switch is
fried and keeping the starter engaged.  So the two problems could be 
related.  Next time you hear the sound, pull over &amp; feel your neg.
terminal cable to see if it's hot from the extra load.
