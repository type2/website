Subject: Re: Stuck Solenoid

Replacing the solenoid is not too difficult.  I bought a new one for $20 
at the local NAPA store and it took about 10 minutes once the starter was 
out (this is on an &quot;automatic&quot; starter, I think they are all the same.)  
Just start taking out the screws that look like they hold the solenoid on 
and it will come off.  Be sure to get the solenoid core hooked to the 
throw-in lever when reassembling and put back together. Pretty much 
idiot-proof.
