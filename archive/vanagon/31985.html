&gt; Each major area has its own edition. Some overlap, but if you get the Los
&gt; Angeles Recycler, the Orange County Recycler, the Inland Empire Recycler,
&gt; and the San Diego Recycler, you'll pretty much cover the spread, with
&gt; little overlap. And you'll have more old-VW ads than you know what to do 
&gt; with,

My experience with the recycler is, that being free to advertise, they
have a lot of junk and *really thrashed* cars in there.  I prefer the
newspapers, and the Auto Trader.  Both cost money to advertise in, and
both have been very good to me, both for buying and selling.  

&gt; I don't know what delivery options they offer, but if you're serious about
&gt; buying a car this way, ask for the fastest delivery they offer, overnight
&gt; or two-day if possible. Good VWs tend to get snapped up fairly quickly.

Ain't that the truth.  Like by 8 am Thursday morning.  You really have
to be here if you want to catch the great deals.  Often I have been in
sleazy used car lots and seen classifieds on the desks and guys with 
greasy hands eagerly looking through them and calling.  To get the good 
deals, you have to beat all of these guys to them.  The absolute *best*
way to get a deal, IMO, is to go cruising around middle class
neighborhoods until you see a VW bus in someone's driveway or yard that
obviously has been sitting a while.  Knock on the door and ask them if
they will sell it.
