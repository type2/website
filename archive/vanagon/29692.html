&gt;-- [ From: Mike Mott * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --



&gt;Anyone have any ideas for freeing extra large phillips head screws?
&gt;
&gt;
  Mike,
   You can pick up a hammer operated &quot;impact driver&quot; at most flea markets or
well supplied hardware stores or a good tool supply place.  Should be less
than $20.  Probably less.  They work great. The impact of the hammer serves
to keep the phillips bit in the screw and turns it a bit at the same time.
I've used them plenty on the case screws on motorcycles over the years.  It
might even save a screw that allready a little stripped.  Good luck.
              Doug
