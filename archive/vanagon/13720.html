  I think the rotor governers were used on '72 -'74 twin carb Type IV engines,
  not the earlier upright fan engines. The parts place always asks me if I
  want the $30.00 one for my '74 or a $4.00 one from a '71 &lt;which is what
  I use&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;A faulty distributor rotor may cause the engine to cut out on some 
&gt; 69 to 71 VW Type 1, 2, and 4 vehicles.  the rotor has a built in 
&gt; centrifugal govenor cutout that prevents the engine from 
&gt; over-revving.  Low speed cuto out may be caused by a weak govenor 
&gt; spring.  the rotor can be replaced with a conventional non-governor 
&gt; rotor, but the engine may be damaged by over-revving.&quot;
