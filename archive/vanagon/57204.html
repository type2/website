Subject: Re: Help on importing a Canadian EV Double Cab

&gt;To date, I have contacted the EPA and their response was no problem.  All
&gt;1988 and up vehicles sold into Canada meet US Federal Emissions
&gt;standards.

My '85 Crewcab has an EPA sticker on the rear plate inside saying it
'complies with USA/California emissions requirements for year of
manufacture'.   Truck vs. car regs differ, check a bit further on the DOT
stuff.  Tim Smith
