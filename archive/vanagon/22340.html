Subject: Re: Seat Belts

In 1985 my brand new Toyota pickup and I were the filling in a &quot;sandwich&quot;
wreck--smashed it in front to the windshield, in back up to the axle.  I had
my belt on and received only three cracked ribs, caused by the belt.  Had I
not been wearing it I *know* I'd have been in the hospital, maybe worse.  

I didn't get a ticket, either :)

Wear yer belts!
