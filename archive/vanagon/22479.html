&gt; My  heart is so heavy tonight.
&gt;&gt; If it were not for the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia I would not have:
&gt;&gt; -the intrest I have in VWs and my '76 Camper
&gt;&gt; -my girlfriend
&gt;&gt; -my BEST friends 
&gt;&gt; -lots of friends I have not met yet who wave or would stop if I was on 
&gt;&gt; the side of the road because they saw a Dead sticker
&gt;&gt; -the intrest in the varied styles of music that I do
&gt;&gt; -and lots more

My wife and I took a break from the scene about a 1 1/2 years ago for various
reasons (pregnancy, baby, school and more). One of the reasons I bought this
'76 for restoration ws that we were really looking forward to going to the
October Shoreline shows. Would have been the first show for both bus and
baby. Some of our best times were spent in Leilani's old '71 Camper chasing
Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. To me busses and the Dead are
inseparable.
So, the last couple of days working on the body have been bittersweet. I'm
going to miss Jerry.
