Subject: Aluminum Crank Case..Weld or Replace?


hey now,

i was wondering...doing my rebuild my friend sean noticed that my crankcase
has been welded in the past...and we suspect this is were my mystery oil 
leak was coming from.

earlier i was thinking about just replacing it...i can get one for $250 
and this would come with the bottom end also...but Bob Hoover suggested 
that the aluminum cases can be welded and rewelded. i respect bob's 
advice and it's helped me on more then one occassion. i'd like to hear 
what others have done in the past...just to get an overview of the whole 
deal. i'm leaning towards welding...but i want to do this right since i'm 
dropping a buttload of money into the van..it's a keeper. :-)
