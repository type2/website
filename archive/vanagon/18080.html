Subject: Westy Pop-Tops in the wind

Volks,

When I first got my 1971 westy I never had a problem with wind messing with
the pop-top, and cringed when I saw other westies with hold down devices on
the front of their tops.  I had quickly replaced the rubber trim around the
base of the top and also the rubber flap that seals it to the rear luggage
rack area and felt this was the proper way of solving the problem.  Then,
one day, as I was opening the top, I heard a rather metallic snap from the
front.  Since then I have consistently had the wind be able to lift the top
off the car at speed.  I have joined the unfortunates who must use exterior
devices to make sure it doesn't flap up and down in the wind.  I'm using a
strap over the top attached to holes drilled in the rain gutter.  Eww.  I
actually think even if my top hadn't popped something, that I would
eventually, given a high enough wind, still have this problem.  I've looked
up front and can't really see anything broken either.  I tie the inside of
the top down with rope at the old rubber hold down locations, since I don't
trust them for doo-doo.  

Comments?

Eug,
'71
