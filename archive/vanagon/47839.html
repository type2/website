Thanks to everyone for the advice and suggestions. The auction route is a 
bit scary because of the uncertain history of the vans and more so due to 
the absolute lack of after sale support. (I realize VW dealers don't get 
much credit for their parts &amp; service departments, but unlike an 
auctioneer, the dealers at least have parts and service.)

Add to that this particular dealer seems to be motivated to move this 
van...  who knows, I may actually get the stats to change.

Thanks again,

Matt Dekker
