Subject: engine removal/installation

	Dave,
	I've removed a 69 engine, separately, my myself, but having thought 
about it, Ian and I are going to install the engine for the '70 single
cab with tranmission mounted already. If the 74 westie has a welded-in
rear apron, then I wouldn't even consider engine and trannie separately.

	You must have a good floor jack, helper(s) and time in 
either event, but even working out in the open, getting my new
rebuilt engine's clutch to mount on the tranny input shaft took
several minutes and a lot of huffing and puffing and fooling
around. As it was, we probably took about 5 minutes to get them
together, another 5 to bolt and nut everything, including the
starter, in place, and then, and ONLY then, did we install the
exhaust system and the air-directing tin underneath.

	I wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much working with
the tranny already in the car!

	Plus, this way, we have just the motor-mount beam and the front
mount on the tranny, all visable from below, when we do the installation.

	Your milage may vary and all that- I hope to have more progress 
to report after this weekend!
