Hi all

I'm still looking for help on finding the engine bleed valve.   I can't
find it and the Bentley photo is too indistinct.  All I can find is a
rotating valve(?) at the top of the thermostat housing.  I gave it a full
turn anticlockwise but no air or coolant emerged.

Can anyone let me know where it is?  I'd be most grateful.
