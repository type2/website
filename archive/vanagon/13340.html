Subject: Re: What's the difference?

why not i'll try and respond to the best of my abilities. Other feel free
to input, i don't claim to be an authority on all VW Vans

sometimes a combi.

actually they are &quot;Kombi's&quot; (short for combination, i.e. you could remove
the seats and haul cargo) and as far as i know kombi's was the generic term
for window vans w/ no interior (i am not sure if combi's came standard w/
seats or not, anybody know better?). I only refer to pre 68' window vans in
Europe. Kombi is kind of a generic term that is often used in a vague way
to refer to air cooled vans. I have heard Africans refer to bay window vans
as &quot;kombi's&quot;

 So what are Vanagons,

Vanagon's are the standard vans made from 1980-1991. The Westfalia Camper
conversion is based upon outfitting a vangon sheel (w/ mod's)

 Eurovans

Eurovans started production in 1992, the 4th generation &quot;bus&quot;

,
&gt;Buses,

buses is a generic term for all VW vans (IMHO)

Kombis

se above dis.

Syncros

4WD Vanagons were referred to as syncros (the syncro has a viscous (sp?)
coupling that distributes power between front and rear wheels, depending on
terrain, if wheels are spinning etc.) Note syncro's were available as an
option on ALL models (double cabs, vanagon etc.)

and Campers?

camper is a generic term to refer to a multitude of VW authorized and other
note so glorious camper conversions.
&gt;
&gt;Over to you...
&gt;
&gt;B ) 'later...
