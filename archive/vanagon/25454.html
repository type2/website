Subject:      Snow Tires??


in the new, November 1995 issue of Automobile magazine, they have an
article about some snow tires ... and one particularly interesting
tire is the Bridgestone Blizzak WS-15. here's some test results:

and in the article, they say:
&quot;The Blizzak has few if any faults as a true winter-traction tire.
Its level of grip, whether starting on an icy hill or powering out of
a tight corner, is phenomenal.&quot;

ok, so what? well, the only reason all this caught my eye was this:
&quot;Better yet, the Blizzak is newly available this fall in sizes suitable
for many sport-utility vehicles.&quot;

and then, a little father on in the magazine, one advertiser has this:
The Tire Rack (800) 428-8355 ad:
&quot;Vans &amp; Minivans. Packages include: (4) Bridgestone Blizzak Tires
                                    (4) NEW STEEL WHEELS
   Volkswagen  Vanagon (Passenger Van)*   $472
               Eurovan (Passenger Van)*   $528

(their non-package price for 185/70QR-14 Blizzak is $62 each ... ??
the package part doesn't say what size the tires are).

ok. so the &quot;passenger van&quot; seems to rule out the campers. maybe.
and the * seems (to me) to mean the tires are black-wall with black
lettering (since there is a reference to &quot;raised white lettering on
the sidewall of the tire (unless otherwise indicated).&quot;

i don't see anything in the article or the ad about the load rating
or max pressure, so i don't really know if the tires in the ad are
&quot;rated&quot; for the buses.

anyway, if you Snowbirds are thinking about winter tires, you now have
something else to think about. :)
