Subject: Need auto-stop propane tank valve
Date: 22 Feb 1996 06:09:27 -0500



   Hey!

   I've got an 85 Westy that's been a faithful companion/occasional 
residence for the last year, but the auto-stop fill valve on the
propane tank is broken and I'd like to get it replaced for the summer.
I went last summer to some RV mechanic and he told me that it'd cost
about $400 Cnd! Someone out there must know where I can find one of
these babies for cheaper than this... Up until now I've just been
using my backpacking stove and throwing some ice-packs in the fridge.
   Oh yeah- I don't have one of those fancy electric water pumps for
my sink either so I rigged up a hand pump that fits neatly behind the
drivers seat. There must be some kind of cheap electric pump that can
be modified use for the same purpose...any ideas? I refuse to pay VW
for their over-priced parts (make that 'I can't pay')...

   Thanks,
   
    Mike
