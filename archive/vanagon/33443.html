Subject: Slick 50 on the Web

All,

For those that might be interested I have found some web sites that have
test results on Slick 50 and other oil additives, as well as some
general info. I have not had a chance to examine them all in detail, but
as always, use your own good judgement when reading these, as I am sure
that the researchers had a bias one way or the other:

seem to get to it from here, but maybe someone else can)
