I'm confused...of all the Type 2s imported of the split window type,
pickups were never more than 10% of the total Type 2 sales figures,
double cabs were never more than 1 or 2 percent.


As to swing axle handling problems, don't sweat it. First off Type 2
s aren't fast enough for you to get in trouble, and they actually 
handle better with a load. We used a 62 p/u to haul logs around 
15 years ago, and it could hold 3/4 ton no problem.
