Subject: '71 Idle fixed/still wondering about AD Engine

Thanks to Joel for the fix on my idle. The brake vacuum booster cable had
been pulled off and was hanging...silly me, I didn't realize it went into
the intake...thusly, no idle. I fixed it when I went home for lunch. 8-)

I still don't know about the AD stamp on my 1600 engine, but in the words
of Drew Bybee, &quot;Patience is a virtue and a virtue can't hurt-you.&quot; (You've
got to say it for the poetics to do their justice.)

Thanks! Joe
