Subject: flex brake lines for splitty recommendation?



(back from vacation mode :)

I am in the market to replace the flex lines on my single (eep!) master cylinder brake system for my 
1965 Westfalia. I would be happy to hear anyone's recommendations on who is the best vendor to 
deal with (has any body used the brake lines from RMMW??) for these flex lines. I would prefer to go 
the NOS route (or a very good _flexible_ replica) as opposed to the somewhat brittle and hard to 
adjust Brazilian repros (is this what RMMW sells??).

Any advice would be appreciated.

michael
