Subject: RE: '73 Toyo-Westy 

Hi all:
	A couple of questions came in about the Toyfalia. I haven't given
it a close inspection so I don't know if it is a 22R engine or not. What
is more, I am guessing that the owner doesn't know either. So where do I
look on the engine to find out?
	I am no mechanic so I can't really attest to the shape it is in
(i.e., the engine). The owner said it is pretty loud (problem is a rusted
out exhaust manifold). Also, it apparently backfires a bit (Is that very
serious or would a tune-up solve it?) (Note: I am making no pretense of
hiding my ignorance).
	The location of the radiator was also a point of interest. It is
located on the driver's side and is positioned parallel with the wheels.
The engine access hatch on the rear deck (inside the bus) has been
enlarged to improve access to the engine bay. A couple of pieces of wood
have been placed there to cover the enlarged hole.
	Also, there is no air cleaner on the carburetor. It looked as if
an air cleaner just wouldn't fit.
	The kicker is that I am going out of town tonight. By morning
we'll be in old Mexico! So I suppose by the time I get back the Westyota
will be sold.

	Thanks again!!
