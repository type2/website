Subject: Re: Old busses and snow-a good mixture?

My '71 does great with four studded tires.  It does much better then my '84
Vanagon.  I live in the mountains (on the side of Mt. Shasta) of the
southern Cascades.  We have lots of snow. Most of the time wet freezing,
slick, stuff.  The kind of snow that is much tougher on cars and drivers
then the dry fluff of the Rockies.

I have a theory that the older the car the better feel you have for the
road and conditions.
