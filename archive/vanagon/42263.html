Subject: [A] 2.0L pushrod tube seals

Hi gang,

I'm finally getting around to addressing the chronic low-level oil leak 
that seems to be coming from the pushrods in my 1976 2.0L westy. 

I splurged and spent the big $$$ for the official VW seals.  Dunno if 
this helps, but it's done.  The seals came in two different colours: 
muddy brown and brick red/orange.  Both seals appear to have exactly the 
same dimensions, but the brown seals appear to be slightly more dense.  
Why the difference?  Which colour seal goes on which end of the pushrod 
tube?  I was told by the VW parts guy that brown=block, orange=head, but 
the parts guy looked less than confident, and he *does* work for a VW 
dealership, so I thought I'd better ask you folks first.

Thanks!

Tobin
