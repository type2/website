Subject: Re: Thermostat and other things???


&gt;condition warranted. If I replaced the engine and I had the flaps, I 
&gt;reinstalled them, if not, I left them out.
&gt;
&gt;My bus is the first type II I have owned, the thermostat is in and I left
&gt;it in.  So far as I know, it works.  If it ever fails I will pull it
&gt;without hesitation. 

It looks like there's a bit of confusion over this thread. Some people say 
they take out the thermostat (the metal bellows type thing) and some people 
leave out the flaps (the bits inside the fan housing). They will have 
different effects. If the thermostat fails or is missing, the flaps are 
spring loaded (at least after about '60 or so) so they will always be in the 
fully open position. This will just mean that the engine takes lomger to 
warm up. If the flaps are removed altogether the air flow over the cylinders 
will not be as it should. I remember reading this in a VW service bulletin 
that warned against removing the flaps, even in the hottest climate. It said 
that the flaps, when in the open position, direct the air where it is needed 
most, and if they are removed there is a possibility of localized 
overheating. Now I'm not claiming this is gospel but it sounds plausible, 
doesn't it. So some parts of your engine could fry while others never reach 
the correct temperature.
Personally I would prefer to have a working thermostat. It's there for a 
good reason and, whatever you think it does for your engine, at least it 
helps warm up the interior a little faster.
