Subject: Re: Air Vents etc

I have ordered a Bentley so that I can take my 87 Westy apart in order to
plug up the vents at the source.  I would love it, if you come up with a
simpler solution.  Jim McCarthy

&gt;Okidoki, thanks to Jim and others we now have a how-to on the vents etc.       
&gt;
&gt;For winter work, how do you close off all external frigid air to the front
&gt;of a Westie?  I can't seem to get the levers to shut down all airflow so I
&gt;bought some sorels and a blanket.
&gt;
&gt;Now that it's summertime, this is a non too pressing question but I'm sure
&gt;Tim in the great north knows these things as does Harry.  So how-do-dey-do-dat?
