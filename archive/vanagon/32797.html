 &gt; Gregg, there is a small black box underneath the van near the driver's wheel
 &gt; well. It is basically under the speedometer and you can see the cable 
coming 
 &gt; out of it (when you are lying underneath the van). On the front side is a 
 &gt; small button you depress into the box to reset the O2 counter. There is no 
 &gt; intelligent connection to the O2 sensor or fuel/ox control system.

RIght.  There's a picture of this on page 90.15 of the Bentley manual, if you 
have this.

As far as I know, the only purpose of the light is to remind you to change the 
O2 (aka Lamda) sensor.
