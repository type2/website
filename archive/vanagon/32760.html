Subject: VDO Speedo Repair...

Volks,

I finally got to remedy the ailing speedo on my '65 today.  Symptons:

Needle slowly climbs, does not return to zero (readily) when stopped.

Also (minor) Generator light is no longer green.

Removed speedo from dash (requires removal of parcel tray).

pride off chrome casing from speedo body.  Can be done w/o distorting
by using hands and an occasional gentle persuasion via small screwdriver.

I found that by pushing in on the post that receives the speedo cable
causes the needle to bind with in the mechanism.  I removed the internal
casing (cast aluminum, held by two small screws) and inserted two small
washers between this case and the back of the speedo face.  Screwed down
tight and tested by inserting a coffee stirrer (perfect size) and rotated
the female post (where the speedo cable connects in to).  No binding.

For the green plastic generator lense, I found it was burned through at the
exact dimensions of the hole on the speedo facia.  I merely un-taped this piece
of plastic (about 1 cm x 1 cm square) and moved it as to cover the port in 
the speedo facia.  Re-taped (used Scotch mailing tape) and now I have the
green light again.  

Carefully removed all rubber gaskets (between glass and speedo facia) and 
cleaned glass and polished chrome. 

Now off to re-install....
