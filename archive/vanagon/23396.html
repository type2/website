Subject: Re: winches 

&gt;&gt; your van once you get back on solid ground. If you just want to get off 
&gt;&gt; slippery surfaces then a cheap block and tackle set, 1000lbs, 6 foot pull 
&gt;&gt; may suit. Packs away tightly also.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;

A block consists of a set of 3 or 4 pulleys on the same shaft sandwiched 
together in a frame. The tackle is the rope that winds around each pulley, 
back and forth from block to block, plus the hooks/clips whatever attaches 
the thing to the tree. Each pulley doubles the mechanical advantage, the 
1000lb set I have has 8 pulleys (4/block) thus me pulling on the rope with 
125lbs gives 8x that force (1000lbs). Nylon rope, aluminium pulleys, wads 
into to a shoebox size pile, throw it under the front seat. Minor trouble is 
if you want to get 6' of pull at 1000lb you have to pull in 8x 6' or 48' of 
rope, hand over hand. 
        The idea of using a block goes with using a winch also, hook a 
single pulley block onto the rescue tree/truck, run the cable up around and 
back to your vehicle. This will double your pulling capacity, but reduces 
the pull distance by 1/2. Good way to make a light duty winch do some 
heavier work. One note, don't attach the cable back to the winch body itself 
unless you KNOW the winch mount can support 2x the winches rated capacity. 
Better to use an different site, ie. the tow hook.   tim s.
