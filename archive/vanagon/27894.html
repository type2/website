Subject: Midas or not

Any reason not to use Midas for a new muffler on an '87 Syncro? I'd consider 
doing it myself, but I have no garage and it's a bit nippy right now. And 
every time I've messed with exhausts, the dang bolts break off. Plus, if I 
get Midas, it's the last one I'll have to pay for. They want $250 for the 
complete job.
