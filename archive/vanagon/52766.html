I showed my guyfriend  my new keychain, which actually is two interlocking
keyrings, one of which has my VW keys and the other which has all the
insignificant keys.  He wanted to know if this was for quick release of the
VW keys in order to hand them over to the mechanics!?!  Nice guy, right??
(He said it with a smile at least.)
