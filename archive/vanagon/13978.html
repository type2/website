&gt;Anyway, the ones who know what I'm talking about, all point me at the
&gt;Michelin XZX reinforced (185R14) as the replacement for the MXL.  Does
&gt;anyone know the difference between the two?  The best price on XZX that
&gt;I've found is 83.95$ per tire (includes mounted, balanced, new valves, and
&gt;disposal of old tire).  This is basically the same as the MXL price.

i think the difference is width and tread pattern: the MXL is wider.

you ought to have to live with a local vw dealer whose people say &quot;what's a
vanagon???&quot; :(
