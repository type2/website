Subject: Re: Recommendation on Slick 50

&gt; I was at the Sydney Motor Show on Wednesday and a man on the Slick 50 stand 
&gt; impressed me with his display of engines parts that had survived extreme 
&gt; overheating because they had the Slick 50 treatment.

I have read articles and reports that have shown that slick 50 clogs small
oil passages (like the ones in oil pumps and lifters etc.).  Obviously if
the wrong lubrication orifice gets plugged, kiss your engine goodbye.  I
would now use it, but that only my .02 cents worth.
