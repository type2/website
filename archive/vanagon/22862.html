&gt; Yea it has the dual A/C thing, does not have the CD Changer, I don't have

&gt; You just reminded me, I gotta start looking for a hitch.  Do you think 
&gt; the u-haul one is better or about the same as a VW one.  U-haul does have 
&gt; one don't they?

I know there are others - I think I heard that U-Haul had one.  A former 
meber of this list got a hitch put on at a truck accesory place (caps, 
and things)  Don't know what brand.

I put on a Da'Lan (if I remmeber correctly) that I got through a dealer.  
I was so happy with this dealer (and the wife had a part in the decision 
- yes dear) that we got it from Ray Burnette in Alexandria Virginia 
(usual disclaimers)  It was at least thirty dollars cheaper than from 
another dealer!

I would suspect that they all attach in about the same way.  There are 
four bolts that hold on the 'bumper' to the two main beams of the 
chassis.  These four bolts get replaced with longer bolts and two other 
bolts get added.  No welding or drilling.

BUT, getting the third bolt on the drivers side is NASTY.  The nut goes 
behind the heat shield for the muffler.  THat was a cute trick, had to 
pry it open and bend it back.` - even though the nut was a 'handle' nut.  
A nut with a stick welded on.

The electrics on the driver side were easy.  one connector behind the rear 
light access panel.  The passenger side had WAY too many connectors and 
no room to reach them - because of the rear A/C unit.
