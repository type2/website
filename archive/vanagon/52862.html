Subject: Dead '91GL Again

Thanks :-) to several of you who offered ideas to get the van running.

As of today it is still dead. :-(

It has spark at the distributor and at the plugs.

The injectors squirt fuel in a nice cone.

The battery is fully charged and the cranking voltage is somewhat above 10
volts.(Thanks Joel)

When we were changing the water pump we cut the oil pressure line but
repaired it. There is no wire in the rear of the engine except the oil
pressure wire(brown).

I discovered gasoline is a Mountain Dew yellow. I had figured it was red
like in the old days. We thought it might be a batch of bad gas. BTW, the
fuel pump is putting out a good flow. Up to specs per Bentley.

Tomorrow I check the engine timing. Could something have failed a screwed
up the engine timing?

When cranking, it acts as if the timing is way late. It goes puff-puff-puff
but doesn't really get serious about running. No back firing.

Is there a real genius/guru that can figure this one out? More to follow as
we put on a full-court press.

Herb
