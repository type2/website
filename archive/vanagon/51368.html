Subject: 84 Westy Compression Test



I just did a compression test on my 84 Westy which has 153K on the clock (I
presume that this is the original engine but cannot be sure).  I got
the following readings (these are &quot;wet&quot; i.e. with oil in cylinder):

1  175
2  190
3  179
4  213

These look pretty good although I am puzzled by #4 which is 23psi above the
spec for a new engine (90psi).  How could this happen?
