Subject: clattering scare

Well, I had a heart wrenching scare this evening.  We decided to go to the
library, so I started 'er up and there was this quite pronounced knocking. 
It sounded serious and continued the 4 or so miles to the library and
back.  I was pretty sad and scared.  Then, as I idled it, it started to
clear up.  I'm now suspicious and hopeful that it was due to the van
having sat since Tuesday noon and losing oil in the lifters.  Is this
possible or should I keep worrying about major things?

I have an exhaust leak in the side that was making the noise, so it's a
little hard to decide which noise I'm hearing, but the clatter/knock/tap
was definitely not exhaust, and now it's gone. 

Any opinions?

Also, I'm not going to be at work friday (tomorrow) so I guess I'll miss 
out on the immediacy of the fun, but if anyone happens to get a second, 
I'm still curious about whether I should be buying a 228mm disk for my 
clutch?

Thanks.
