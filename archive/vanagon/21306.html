Subject:       Re: Westy table knob/bolt

&gt; While I was at the dealer earlier this week, I priced out a couple 
&gt; Westy parts for fun.  These parts are in CDN $$$, and for a '90 
&gt; Westy.  The water faucet/tap is $171, and the water tank pump is 
&gt; $165.  I was thinking of getting a couple parts here and there for 
&gt; when I need them, but at these prices I don't think so.  Of course, 
&gt; if one waits too long, they won't be available.... hmmm.
&gt; 

You might also want to check with Euro - American RV Products, aka &quot;Delta 
Six Industries&quot;, and OEM for many of the Westy camper components.  I just 
received a catalog and all these parts are listed, cross-referenced by the 
VW P/N.  While prices aren't given, past experience has been that they're 
much lower than VW dealer prices - sometimes half the dealer price.  Still 
maybe more than can be justified for spares, but considering the hassles 
of finding suitable substitutes when VW or Delta Six finally pulls the 
plug, maybe not.
