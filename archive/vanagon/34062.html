Subject: Re: volks cafe in santa cruz, ca?

volks cafe is my favorite vw shop.  they are real nice guys.  Peter, who runs
the place, was the Roving Wrench before setting up shop formally.  Now its
expanded and he never has time to talk.  hed see me mountain biking around
town and ask me if my bus had broken down (no, i like to bike 7 miles through
the redwoods - what bliss, i go to the vw shop when its broken, keep away
when its not)

now when i visit sunny califoria they cut me great deals (should i say this)
as an old customer.   I promised Ron piccies of the meat wagon.

They also put up in greta humour my stupid question trying to figure out my
bus as i wanted to fix it myself

anyway, they are a repair shop and sell parts, not coffee and kuchen

8) :) :)
