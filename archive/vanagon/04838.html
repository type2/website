&gt;Will front seats from any other model VW fit this bus WITHOUT modification?
&gt;I'd rather not have to modify the seat mounts if at all possible.

i'm not 100 percent certain, but they sure LOOK like the same rails. but i
don't have anything to compare my vanagon with, so i can't be sure. best
way would be to go to a junkyard and check it out. cause i'm working from
memory here ... and my memory has been shown to be flakey at times. :)
at the very worst, you could get some later bread-loaf seats ... like from a
1978 or 79. but that's not very much different from what you have on the 68.
