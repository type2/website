Ron L. was inquiring about a bulbless socket found in his tail light assembly:

A couple of guesses here; either a rear fog light doohickee thang (pretty
cool, actually), or, that parking light/lamp thang that's used in Germany
when half the vehicle is sitting on someone's sidewalk.  The only time I've
ever seen those lights (and the switch to activate them) in the US was on 
a friend's grey market 733i.

Tell ya what, Ron, why don't you rig them up so it sents a blinding light
into tailgaters' eyeballs?   ;-)
