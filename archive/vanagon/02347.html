Subject: Re: window rubber

&gt;Well I'm about to go ahead and do it. After two years putting it off I am
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ There's a first time for everyone...
&gt;going to order window seals all around for my 71 bus. Any suggestions were
&gt;from? You got your BFY, your West Cost Metric, your Bus Boys, your Keith's
&gt;Foreign Auto Parts, and of course your JC (what' s an 800#?) Whitney. Is there
&gt;any difference in quality or does one rubber fit as well as another. Recently
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Jeez,
and I thought that thread was starting to die off...
&gt;someone complained on how impossible it was to get the window scraper on the
&gt;drivers side on, I think he said he ordered from BFY. Keith's Foreign Auto
&gt;Parts seemed to have the best price (their catalog is the same as WCM, go
&gt;figure?) but when I called for an updated price list, (205) 251-8965, the
&gt;recording said the # was no longer in service.
&gt;  Well, any suggestions or words of wisdom would be most graciously received
&gt;from one who has never even seen it done. Thanks.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ a driver's license, a van, and
you've never done it ?????????
