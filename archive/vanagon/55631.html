&gt;Looking at this image of the South African Vanagon,  I see the rear most
&gt;windows are sliders, not solid.  Does anyone know if these are
&gt;available?  Same window opening in body?

if you look very carefully, you'll see that the windows are larger than the
euro/us/canadian vanagons. :(  and notice that the side body panels are NOT
the same shape ... the trim indention is gone and the sides are flatter.
take a look at the rear air intakes, too.

makes you wonder if they'd make one in left-hand drive. :)
