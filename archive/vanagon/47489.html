Subject: anyone in Cincy/Dayton, OH area?

Is there anyone in the Cincinnati/Dayton, Ohio (or surrounding area) 
crazy enough to want to help in replacing a wasserboxer head gasket? I 
have a little $$ to pay someone, hopefully with more experience than I 
(which is none!). I'll have all the parts and such by next week. So, 
are ya' yellow?
