Subject:       Oil seal woes

&lt;response to Joel, posted to listserv for interest&gt;

Hi Joel--
We are quite possibly bretheren... I read your list of improvements 
to your van and thought there's a guy as afflicted as I am :-) Our 
winters our cold here and I added a 12volt circulation pump in the 
cooling system to boost heater output, it worked well for boosting 
heater output but the pump seal didn't 
hold up to that slippery antifreeze...
 To answer your question, I'm from Bemidji -- northern Minnesota.  

This listserv is great, I believe I've already found the answer (worn 
main bearings) from Marshall Soares, one of the readers... do you know how long (and 
much) this has bugged me?  I can't stand oil leaks!  Now all it takes 
is a BIG checkbook for a rebuilt engine, any tips/sources appreciated 
for rebuilds.

In the process of diagnosing where the leak was coming from 
originally, I used the floruescent dye tracers for the oil -- that 
really works well.  I had all the stuff for it and brought it into 
the dealer when they separated the engine/tranny.  The dealer then 
order the tracing stuff too!

Anyway, if you find something that indicates it might not be this 
severe I'd appreciate knowing.
