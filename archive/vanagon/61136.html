Subject: Need some bits...

Well, I am now the proud new owner of an '86 Syncro Doublecab Truck,
a god-awful tan color (saddle?  buckskin?) but in really nice shape.

I am in need of some little bits to finish this up, though.  The first
thing I need is the &quot;Transporter&quot; badge from the rear -- this one is
missing.

Second thing is opening rear windows (yeah, I know...).

For those of you who know, is it possible to get vents in the back?  The
hole is there for the vents high on the sides, but the fourth lever on the
heater controls is, of course, not there (it is not there on three of my
VW's now!) and I have no idea if it is reasonable to fit the seals to the
front doors and get *some* ventilation in the rear -- at least until I find
(or make) some rear sliders.  

Finally:  Are owner's manuals, in English, still available for the trucks in
Canada?  The regular manual *says* &quot;Transporter&quot;, and actually is the manual
for the Kombi and the panels, but is there a different one for the trucks?
I'd love to get one.
