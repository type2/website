&gt;How fast ultimo?  My bunker-burner has pushed me up to 75 mph on the flat
&gt;with some pedal left - maybe a little tailwind too ??
&gt;
Long ago, when I was young and foolish, as was my '85 Vanagon, I received a 
ticket for doing 120km/hr. The nice man said I was doing 135km/h, which I 
had to agree was true, but he would give me a break. He had caught up and 
followed me for a couple of miles at 3:00 am on the wide open Canadian 
Autobahn in Quebec. The pedal was not floored, but close I assume. I was in 
the final 300 mile leg of a 900 mile journey, at a steady 120-125 km/hr. 
This was mostly level driving, indifferent wind conditions. The absolute 
fastest sustained speed I have ever hit was 144 km/hr (89.5 mph). Scared me 
when I noticed the speedo, again just cruising late night long trip. The gas 
fuel injection cuts out if you over rev the engine, I don't know at what 
RPM. In second gear this occurs around 65-70 km/hr. The engine misses, 
letting you know what's up. I've never hit this in 4th. gear. Anyone out 
there who has? I don't drive like this anymore, but I must say that the 
vanagon was dead smooth, no wandering, buffeting or floating feelings from 
the beast. Wheeee...  Vanagons do seem to be highway cruisers, better than 
the microbus. Downside, beyond the ticket that is, is that gas mileage goes 
to 15-16 mpg (Canadjun gallons, eh!), normally 21 at 120 km/h. Can't wait to 
find a 160HP Subaru motor, the additional 65Hp ought to do wonders, a 100mph 
bus?. Hope the windshield holds up!   tjs.
