	Thanks for the pointer to Ellsworth, David!

	I'll talk with them and Bugformance, at the minimum.

	First we drill-out the locks on the cargo compartment and
see how much of the engine tin is stowed in there- Previous Owner
says there isn't anything left over, and the entire fan shround is
missing!

	My brother's advice is to start with a long block and not
fool with either the heads or top-end. A number of persons on the list
here have advised against using the case/rod/cranks.

	The Bus Stop's catalog shows all the tin and accessories
clearly, so I can make a complete inventory easily.

	I'm going to talk with the Smog Check referees and see what
they say about accessories, single/dual port, etc. With dual ports,
34 PCIT-3 carb and double-hose distributor, the blown engine seems
to basicly be a &quot;71&quot; style, matching the dog-house oilcooler!

	I went out and sat in it last night- its fun!
