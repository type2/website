Subject: wiper relay

Well I took the advice, and prodded at my electrical system with a wire.  
I took out the wiper relay, turned on the wiper and fan switches, 
connected the leads, and sure enough, the appliances came to life!  Went 
to VW, paid $22.60 for a new relay, and everything works :) Why am I 
always nervous after I fix something, that the solution will only last 
until the next bend in the road. Am I alone here? Anyway, It's REALLY 
nice to be able to wash/wipe my windows again.  I even got a new set of 
wiper blades, and the rear wiper seems to move MUCH better :)
