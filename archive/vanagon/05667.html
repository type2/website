&gt; I would take it that James Brill's 71 made-in-November van was made in 11/70.
&gt; The higher-priced heater boxes in JCWitless are for the Type 4 engines, 
&gt; commencing with 8/71 manufacture for the 1972 model year.

Ok, now we might be on to something.  I am pretty sure that the plate 
in the side of the van says 11/71.  The vin begins 231...which makes 
it a '71 kombi.  So what gives?  Do I really own a '72?  If the plate 
does say that it is 11/70 then I must indeed have a '71.  I will 
double check that.  Sure would be a load off my checkbook to get the 
cheaper exchangers.  That must be it.  Thanks for clearing things up.
