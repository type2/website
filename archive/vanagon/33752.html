&gt;&gt;the weather is a danger to the condition of the car.  I doubt that was
&gt;&gt;the case here.  Cars are meant to be driven and appreciated, not stored
&gt;&gt;in locked rooms.

&gt;David,
&gt;
&gt;I'm on your side.  Some place in Chermanny they've probably got a zero-miles,
&gt;right off the assembly line copy of everything VW has every built.
&gt; Everything else is second-best, no matter how hard you try.
&gt;
&gt;Guys get fixated on this NOS, OEM, All Original bullshit.  The shrinks even
&gt;have a definition of it called The Collector Syndrome.
&gt;
&gt;My Volkswagens are pratical, working tools, not toys or museum pieces.  I fly
&gt;old planes and drive old cars because I grew up with them.  I know how to
&gt;keep them running and quite frankly, I find them to be more honest than the
&gt;modern stuff
&gt;
&gt;Less expensive, too :-)

        HALLELUJAH, brother Bob has seen the LIGHT!! SPEAK the gospel brother...

        Personally, I can't say I grew up in 'em (unless you catagorize a
'78 auto Westy with an old upright-same species, different genus in my
mind). But I too appreciate the simplicity of the upright 1600. I also
prefer the older ones with less plastic, although I have the plastic on my
'70. It's all cracked and old, but when I drove my friends '62 bug, the
steel dashbord still looked whole. Sure, it could use some paint, but paint
is relatively cheap. As for OEM, I simply cannot pay that much-if I could I
would. That's why my bus has the much maligned shag carpet, and why I'm
thinking of replacing the missing door panels with nicely finshed wood that
I can make on my own for roughly a third the price of RMMW's neat OEM
panels. And whether or not I do it, my '70 will continue to be my daily
driver until I can get a split. Shag carpet and all.

Peace,
