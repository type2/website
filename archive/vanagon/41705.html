Subject: Re: Help!: Passing CA smog with a modified VW engine


&gt;Last time I checked, leaded regular wasn't even available in California.


I've seen a few isolated stations, no-names all, that still sell gas
that they call &quot;regular&quot;. It's usually in a pump right next to the
&quot;unleaded&quot; and &quot;premium unleaded&quot; pumps. The &quot;regular&quot; pump has the
larger-diameter nozzles, that can't fit into the filler openings of
most post-'75 cars. Unfortunately, Arco stopped selling this stuff
months ago-- my Mustang misses it.

Interesting to note, though, that what is called &quot;regular&quot; today, has
less lead in it than the stuff called &quot;unleaded&quot; in 1975. But as
standards tighten down more and more, it's now called &quot;leaded&quot;.

Even today's &quot;unleaded&quot; gas, has very small amounts of lead, of course,
but far less than other grades. There's no such thing as completely
unleaded gasoline, just as there's no such thing as completely nonfat milk.
I believe that nonfat milk has to have less than three-quarters of a
percent fat content. Regular whole milk has four percent.

VW Content: all the upright-engine buses and bugs, with compression
ratios of 8:1 or less, run on virtually any kind of gas available
in this country. They were first designed in Germany, of course, to
run on the (markedly poorer) grades of gas in that country in the '40s.
What was the compression ratio of the first Hebmullers-- anyone know?
