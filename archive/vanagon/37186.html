Subject: Beer Budget


To All:

I once had encountered a doctor -- a physicain -- who actually expected me to
do a tune-up on his daughter's bug for a six-pack of Safeway house-brand beer
-- $1.19

I told him I normally charge seventy dollars per hour.  (I don't, but in his
case I was willing to make an exception.)

&quot;That's ridiculous!&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.  But not half so ridiculous as an asshole making two hundred grand a
year expecting to get a hundred bucks worth of work for six cans of beer.&quot;
