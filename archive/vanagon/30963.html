&quot;Alimony is a bitch&quot;

&gt;Actually, The key is to show your SO that you can make money on a vehicle.
The quicker the turn the better. After you do this once or twice you can
S-L-O-W down the p-a-c-e until the &quot;new arrival&quot; ends up as a fixture. On
one occasion, I arrived home with a new title in hand and presented it to
the wife while she was on the phone and couldn't concentrate at the moment
on what it meant. She perked up when I showed her it was a $300. 15 window =)))
&gt;She REALLY perked up when I sold it soon after for $1500. with out turning
a wrench or transferring the title. The guy that bought it was thrilled. (So
was I as it was a rat. He was fully aware of exactly what it was and what he
was getting. It way beyond what I wanted to deal with at the time.
