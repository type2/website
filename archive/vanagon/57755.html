Subject: Re: Eurovans, Winnebago and Westfalia

There certainly were EuroVan Westfalia Weekenders sold.  Saw one today
on 101 south of San Jose, the lovely bright Teal color.  I remember
three lined up, their tops popped a few months ago at the VW dealer on
Steven's Creek in San Jose (all used ones).  Now they have four Winnebagoes,
all white and boring.  The Westies say &quot;Westfalia&quot; on the roofs, but the
roof is really thin, and goes the full length of the van.   

No bright Teal any more...
