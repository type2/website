&gt; Hey Ed,
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't care for the look of yellow headlights why are you even
&gt; wasting your time writing this message. I wouldn't put this in the same
&gt; category as loud stereos and bad drivers. Congradulations if you live in
&gt; a place where the police do not enforce the laws, but here in NJ they do
&gt; (especially the state police). I find it very hard to believe that
&gt; anything goes in Connecticut. If its against the law chances are your
&gt; going to get pulled over and either get a warning to remove it or a
&gt; ticket. There usually aren't any laws against loud music and as for bad
&gt; drivers....well what can you do.
&gt; The issue of headlights is not a town ordinance or a state law  its a
&gt; national standard. I was merely pointing out that this modification is
&gt; certainly illegal and that you might use the money you would otherwise
&gt; spend paying the ticket on something else. Thanks for your $0.02!
&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; I just called the New Jersey Dept. of Motor Vehicles and the person
&gt; &gt;&gt; there said that all headlight lenses must be clear. Yellow lenses are
&gt; &gt;&gt; illegal. Even if you shipped a car here from Europe you must have the
&gt; &gt;&gt; lights changed to meet US specs. Too bad.... the headlights look much
&gt; &gt;&gt; better yellow :-(

&gt; &gt;Dave, every day I see dangerous loads going down the road. I meet
&gt; &gt;murderous drivers with no regard for life. Sometimes a boombox car (not
&gt; &gt;what I really call them) wakes me up in my sleep. I could continue. I
&gt; &gt;don't know about where you live, but in Connecticut its hard to see how
&gt; &gt;the motor vehicle laws are being enforced at all. This crud (yellow
&gt; &gt;headlights) only seems to matter when you're getting inspected, the rest
&gt; &gt;of the time it seems like the reality of it is, anything goes. In other
&gt; &gt;words, I'd say my chances of being called down on this are slim and
&gt; &gt;none.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At 50 I am just not as worried about this kind of BS as I was when I was
&gt; &gt;younger.

Sorry David, didn't mean to wind you up.
