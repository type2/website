Subject: rear bumper for 83 vanagon

A friend of mine here in Orlando has a 83 vanagon that does not have a rear
bumper. I told him one of the users of the Vanagon list could help him find
one. He didn't know about such a list of owners of Vanagons. Maybe we can
help him find a bumper and join him to the list. Thanks, Bob in Orlando.
