&gt;Nonsense!

&gt;Ask the parts person to pullup the microfiche on the tank.  The cap is a
&gt;separate part and number.  I have ordered several in the past for just a
&gt;few bucks.

The dealer around here wanted about $40 for the cap.  Was unable to locate a
replacement and even had a buddy scour through his research lab for
something.  Did find a couple in the local junkyards.  Paid $5.
