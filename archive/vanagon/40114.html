No-
I have a good dual port that does not knock or smoke for $350
complete turnkey, and includes all German parts and a 009 
distributor. You can hear it run on the test stand. It has great 
throttle response, and is showing no major signs of wear.
It is priced to sell. I hope this helps.

I know this is like asking for a silver needle in a haystack but I am
looking for a good used 1600DP or even a SP to put in my little red
super beetle that I rescued from the junkyard last summer.  I can sell
the car to guy in town who expressed interest in it and I figure if I
can get one more VW on the road, so be it!  I need to finance my
project car so I must sell.  Anyhow, if anyone remotely close to
Beatrice, NE (40 miles south of Lincoln or 100 miles south of Omaha/4
hours north and west of KC, MO) has a good used engine that will run
pretty decent, has halfway good compession, no knocks or nothing, I'd
be interested.  Thanks!
