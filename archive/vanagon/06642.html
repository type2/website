&gt; Nice drawing Lee :-) but you want the cold water going in at the bottom and  
&gt; out at the top. Wizard sell these things (complete with plans) so you  
&gt; wouldn't have to bother making your own, although the stainless steel is a  
&gt; nice idea. I think they are about 50 quid. You could use a low powered  
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Andy, any chance of posting details on where to get these things?

&gt; [stuff gone]
