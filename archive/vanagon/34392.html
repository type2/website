Subject: Air Filters

Jim,

The only truly reusable filter is an oil-bath type, and even that requires
the coir baffle to be washed with kerosene from time to time, the oil bath
changed and so forth.  Filters of treated paper are almost as good at
trapping small particles as an oil bath.  Once trapped, they are discarded.
 'Reusable' filters that do not include some disposable element for trapping
fine particles are suspect, since the particles you want to worry about are
too small to be removed by conventional cleaning methods.  

Oil bath air filters are based on a fundamental principle of physics, wherein
the greater mass of any particulate matter, as compared to the mass of a
molecule of air, prevents the particle from negotiating the sharp bend
introduced in the air stream, causing the particle to collide with the pool
of oil and become trapped.  

Paper, cloth or other filters are based on the labyrinth principle.  In
tests, oil-bath (or water, for large stationary engines) have proven to be
more efficient, albeit larger and messier and requiring more maintenance.

Off-roaders use paper filters only because oil-bath types do not stand up to
the jolts.  Military 'off-road' equipment such as tanks (!) use a combination
of centrifugal and labyrinth principles.  The centrifugal filters are either
active (ie, consuming power) or passive, using ducts and vanes to create a
vortex in the air-flow.  Labyrinth filters usually have a reusable outer
filter and a disposable inner filter, the former for coarse material, the
later for fine.

Your Volkswagen's oil bath air cleaner may look clunky and out of date, but
if properly maintained it does a better job protecting your engine than a
paper air filter.
