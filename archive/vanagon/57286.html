&gt;&gt;Why would VW spec out and use Michelin MVX radials of the 205 70/R14

&gt;The 205 70/R14s  is cited on the '90 Carat sticker as being &quot;Reinforced&quot;
&gt;and having the 97 rating. Michelin could have made two tires in the same 
&gt;physical size and &quot;line&quot;, one with a higher load rating than the other.

They DID make both of these.  Vanagons came with the MXL (not MXV) model that
was reinforced.  The Michelin MXL 205 70/R14 was made in a standard version
AND a reinforced version.  As I recall all the size/model lettering on both
tires is the same, except the reinforced version has the word &quot;reinforced&quot;
molded into the sidewall also, and higher ratings shown in the fine print.

Michelin no longer makes the MXL tires and I suppose the MXV is being
discussed as a potential replacement.  I'm not certain of MXV &quot;reinforced&quot; vs
&quot;non-reinforced&quot; details.

With regards to the &quot;passenger vans&quot;  vs  Westy  vs  Syncro  vs  Syncro
Westy, I would bet that they all carried the same recommendation from VW
about tires.  This would be true, because I suspect that they all carried the
same Gross Vehicle Weight Rating.  This rating is the maximum safe rating for
the total weight of the van, the passengers and the cargo.  In the heavier
vans, the maximum stays the same, but their passenger + cargo decreases by
the additional weight that the van already has built into it because of the
added Syncro and/or Westy parts.  If you have the lightest van (a 2WD
passenger model) and you never will load it near the GVWR, you can likely get
by with a tire with a lower load rating.  VW surely would never put its
corporate butt on the line by recommending this though.  They planned for
worst case conditions.  You could opt to plan for less at your own
descretion.......
