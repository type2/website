Subject: Re: TDI:Bolt this onto your van!

&gt;As you can see, it's pretty impressive.  Imagine bolting one of these to 
&gt;your vanagon.  In the pictures it looks no bigger than the motor in my 
&gt;'92 Jetta, which is no bigger than yer average Rabbit diesel motor.  Who 
&gt;knows?  Maybe the 2.4TDI would fit--wheelies in your vanagon!

There has to be some company out there that specializes in engine swaps for 
vanagons, maybe they sell kits or instructions or something? does anyone know?
