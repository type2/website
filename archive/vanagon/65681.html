&gt; On the principle that there is no such thing as a stupid question:

&gt; When I first start the engine, the revs first go to about 1500 rpm and
&gt; then promptly drop to about 1000 rpm where it begins surging between 950
&gt; rpm and 1050 rpm on about one second intervals. After the engine warms
&gt; up, the idle settles down to a respectable 950.
&gt;
&gt; What causes the surging?
&gt; Is there a simple explanation/cure?
&gt; Is it anything to concern myself about?

Larry,
You should find your trouble in one of the following:
1.  Check the adjustment and operation of the throttle switches, namely
the throttle-closed switch. While you are at the throttle body, check
for excessive &quot;slop&quot; in the throttle shaft due to worn bushings;  these
parts are known for wearing out, resulting in an uncontrollable idle.

2.  Check for a vacuum leak.  Be sure and look for a split in the
underside of the boot connecting the air flow meter to the throttle
body.

Good luck.
