Subject: Re: late 80's vanagons



&gt;
&gt;well ... ha! i have ONE (1) unbuilt revell model (from mexico, no less) of
&gt;the vanagon left! there are four  completed versions on my mantle (a camper,
&gt;a panel van, a regular bus, and a double cab pickup) and one incomplete
&gt;version (a shorty ... well, i just never got around to finishing it). if
&gt;anyone finds these things, i'd like to get some more.
&gt;
&gt;now, as to the 'only one', there is a company called Schabak that makes a
&gt;1/43 scale series of vanagons. they are all syncros (just means that the
&gt;gas cap is in the rear) and cost about $10-15. the vw dealer might be able
&gt;to still get the vanagon one. i've found them at a hobby store in atlanta.
&gt;
&gt;and there are other companies (Herpa, Rocco, and Wiking) that make tiny
&gt;HO scale (1/87) vanagons of various types ... pickups, high roofs, panel vans,
&gt;but no campers!! at least, i've not found any. :(
&gt;

	I was thinking that the largest scale model would yield
	the best flume tank data. (see how I make it sound
	like a respectable experiment, not just so that I can
	have models on my mantle) :-)
	
Still interested in a vanagon westy model - Alistair
