Hello,
	I had the same problem with my 73.  No timing marks.  A
neighbor had a later bus, 78 I think, and I belive the marks were
different.  I think the pictures in my Muir book looked different for
the years.  I took my piece off and took it down to a vw shop.  They
didn't have any extras but they lined it up with another and made
marks at the degrees I wanted to know. 

take care,
	brandy
