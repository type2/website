I went to bleed the brakes in my '56 bus last weekend, and I got a couple of
surprises.

1) When I looked in the master cylinder (before I started) there was 
absolutely no fluid left.  Does brake fluid evaporate?  There was some in 
it about 3 months ago, and it didn't have a cap on it.

2) With my SO pumping and the blleder open, it took a long time before
anything came out.  Then I got splatters of air/fluid, then nothing.
I loosened the line at the master cylinder (which is real close to being new)
and I got a lot of air out there, and then some fluid.  What's the deal?
After bleeding the air out there, I got decent bleeding out of the front
cylinders.

3) I only get an anemic dribble of fluid from the back bleeders, and I bled 
the air out at the master cylinder like I did the fronts,, but still no luck.
I mean its just a barely perceptible dribble. 

4) Part of the fluid i did get out looked like old milk.  Like what you would
get out of a carton with the Lindberg baby's picture on it.

5) When I drove it afterward, it pulled so hard to one side it was
terrifying! (left, BTW)

6) The pedal seems reluctant to return to the upright position; it just kinda
moseys on up at its leisure.  How do ya fix this?

So, where should I start?  I'm in the middle of moving, so I am not ready
to spend a bunch of cash and time right now - I just want to get it driveable.
Is there some way to clean the lines out?  Thats what I'm figuring I'll
have to do.  

I know the basic principles of the braking system, and have replaced 
cylinders and shoes before, but I have never had any probel with brake lines.
I have dealy with pulling before, but never this violent (and that is the
word for it)  

Thanks in advance for any help
