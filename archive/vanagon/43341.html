Subject: [Question] Familiarity with Westy leaking heads??

No, this is no surprise to me.  

I am writing because I am considering purchasing a mid `80s Westy with the
dreaded
&quot;leaking cylinder heads&quot; problem.  Right now, it can be described as the
faintest
hint of coolant between the block and the head on at least one side.

My questions are as follows:  

        -- How long does it usually take until the heads need to be reworked??  
        -- When they're repaired, do they merely remove the heads, install
better
seals and replace them??  Or do you have to replace the heads (assuming
they're not
warped).
        -- How long can a vehicle show the aforementioned signs of leakage
before
it buys the farm??
        -- Is there any documentation which reflects VWs knowledge of the
chronic
head problem??  Either from VW or from Consumer Reports, Autoweek, the New
York Times, 
People, etc.?

Thanks for helping out.  If I don't buy this vehicle, I'd like to point it's
owner
in the right direction.
