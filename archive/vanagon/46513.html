&gt; an incredible apology
&gt;

Wow what an argument!  Impressive indeed.  However, I must present a purely
emotional appeal for the more common (in my experience) spelling of
&quot;Westy&quot;.

It is just this:  Westy looks better to me than Westie.  I'm not sure why.
Is the y a more aesthetically pleasing shape?  Perhaps.  Perhaps it is some
streak of peer pressure (I saw a bunch of y's before I ever saw an ie).
Perhaps I'm just mad.

Too much time on my hands,
Eric
Maggie (76 WestY)

Hmm, that capital Y makes even more difference, don't you think?
