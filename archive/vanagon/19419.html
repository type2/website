&gt;I am helping a friend to replace the pushrod tube seals on his '81

&gt;the catalytic converter and won't let him get the cover off.  So we 
&gt;are wondering what needs to be removed to do this.  Does the exhaust 
&gt;have to come off or at least part way?  He says the Bentley is no help
&gt;in the matter.  He is on the way to the store now to buy an idiot 
&gt;book.  This is all I know.  He is half a continent away from me.  I 
&gt;can't check my Muir from work and I figured someone here might have a
&gt;few things to watch for on this.  Ok, thanks for any help.  Jim

Removing the cat is pretty easy on the 81.  there are 3 *through* bolts and
nuts at each end, as I recall.  It is a bit of a pain to get a wrench on the
nuts, but it may be worth it.  Once the bolts are out, the cat just falls
straight down.  Don't forget to replace the gaskets when you are done.  Also
check for disintegration of the catalyst, a common problem on these babies.
