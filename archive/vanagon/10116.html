Subject: Re: [f] What?
Date: Tue, 17 Jan 1995 13:38:04 -0600 (CST)

&gt; 
&gt; What is this [f] that people put in their subject headers?  I also see
&gt; (f).  And then is there also an {f}?  Are they different?  Are there various 
&gt; other permissible bracketings, such as ([{f}]) ?

Somebody correct me if I am wrong here:  A few weeks back some people 
got (understandably I guess) a little bent out of shape about all the 
non-VW related content of the list.  There was a general feeling, 
however, that a good part of it was what made the list the interesting
creature it has become.  As a compromise someone suggested adding 
an [f] F f, you name it, to the subject heading when the message 
strayed too far from the suject at hand.  That would be VW buses.  
Then, the offending message could be done away with one 
activation of the left middle finger, not what you are thinking.  Some
of us, trying hard to keep harmony in the world, have stuck with it.  
So f means fun here.  It will probably tell you very little about your
ride but if you have a minute it might bring a smile to your face.
