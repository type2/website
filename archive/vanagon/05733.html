Subject: Cabtop Cargo Carrier?

I have an '86 Westy and we love it and travel extensively in it. As any 
of you that have Westys know, storage is an absolute premium, so we want 
to use the roof-top storage area above the driver/passenger area to its 
maximum benefit.
We have looked everywhere to find a carrier/cover that fits and even 
wrote to Westfalia in Germany (no answer), but no one seems to make such 
a thing. 
It would be wonderful if someone made a plastic, weatherproof, enclosure 
that fit there, had tie downs that match the cleats in the top, and the 
whole thing opens to the rear facing the popup opening. 
Does anyone know if there is such a thing?
We have seen a lot of different 'sort-of-work' solutions that different 
folks have tried, but nothing that seems to be a really good solution.
Hope smeone has a lead. - Thanks - Jack
