I thought there already WAS an organization--LimBo (Late Model Bus
Organization).  Interest would appear to overlap.

&gt;Listees,
&gt;
&gt;I'll participate in any effort to preserve the Vanagon list.  Please send
&gt;an address to which I can send a check to continue the list.
&gt;
&gt;Now may be the time to create a permanent organization.
&gt;
&gt;One or two of our members are attorneys.  Others are accountants. Others
&gt;are students or educators. Others have esoteric involvements in business,
&gt;government, religion, science, and the arts. Others are retired.
&gt;
&gt;Each of us is a person with occupations, talents or abilities, who could
&gt;provide pro-bono organizational support. We could confer and create a
&gt;cooperative, or an association, a non-profit organization, or some other
&gt;legal entity,for example, to perpetuate the list through financial
&gt;participation by its users with a goal to create a permanent structure.
&gt;
&gt;I'll participate to any extent necessary, including a check for $50 to
&gt;begin whatever process- -volunteer or non-profit, or for-profit--necessary
&gt;to keep the List in existence.
&gt;
