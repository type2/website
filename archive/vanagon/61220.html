Subject: Some more reasons to watch the mechanic

Had a flat this weekend.  Noticed that Sears would repair it for free,
'cause that's where I bot the tires.  Hours later...the mechanic drives
it into the shop, and is about to jack up my Vanagon BY THE ENGINE!
I scream, then point out the jack point forward of the wheel.
Next, he is about to use his powerful air wrench on the PLASTIC WHEEL
COVER FAKE BOLTS!  More just in time screaming.
Takes tire off, is about to remove tire from wheel when I remind him he
hasn't found the leak yet.  Get his boss over to help him... I end up
finding leak 15 minutes later.  Boss helps this dummy patch tire,
doesn't work.  So boss drills tiny leak hole out to a HUGE hole, then
patches it with a HUGE plug.  
I insist he not use air wrench on nuts, I might have to get them off
someday.  Show him how to screw on nuts, use a torch wrench.  I wince
when I think of what would have happened if I had stayed in the waiting
room.
