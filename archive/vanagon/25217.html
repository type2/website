&gt; &gt; How about towing a Syncro with ALL the wheels on the ground?  It seems to me
&gt; &gt; that this would be o different to the drivetrain than coasting with the
&gt; &gt; clutch in or the transmission in neutral.  Can anyone think of a reason that
&gt; &gt; this would be a problem?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;From what I remember from the manual of my old Mazda 323 GTX:(It was all
&gt; wheel drive)  The problem with towing the AWD vechicles is that all is OK
&gt; until you take a turn, then the front wheels are turning at a different
&gt; speed from the rear wheels and everything gets torn up.
&gt; The Mazda people VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED against this practice as it would
&gt; trash an expensive drivetrain.  

Although turning will put more stress on the fluid coupling than
going straight... You turn when driving just as often as when being towed.

The problem with towing the van on it's drive wheels (in this case there
are four, but it's the same with 2WD vehicles) Is that the upper shaft 
in the tranny is turning (the wheels are turning it) but the lower shaft
isn't (the engine aint turning it).  Thus the upper shaft quickly 
centrifuges all of it's gear oil off and becomes mighty dry with out the 
lower shaft lubricating the tranny.  Now... You could tow it a couple 
miles without any problem, but Don't tow it far or fast.  Or you could stop
the tow vehicle, get out and start up the synchro every couple miles (in 
neutral, clutch engaged) to re lubricate the tranny. Or you could pull 
the engine and tow it in gear, or you could disconnect your rear CVs and 
tow it on the rear wheels, or you could tow it with the engine running, 
or you could use a stick to hold the clutch fully disengaged and tow it 
in gear (I don't recommend this... It's stupidly dangerous).
I'd just disconnect the rear CVs... It's the most reasonable.
