Subject: water fill cap

I decided to try my sink out a few weaks after I bought my Westy.  It turns
out I don't have the key to the water fill cap.  I called the PO and he said
&quot;Oh, so that's what those extra keys in the glove compartment were for, I
threw those out.&quot;  He went on to say that his family always went to camp
grounds and never used the tank.  But anyway, I was wondering what is the
best way to get the cap off. Drill it?  Or is there a way in which I can save
the cap for reuse.  While I'm thinking about the sink, my drain pipe is also
broken.  Does anyone know where I can find one, of course I would prefer an
inexpensive one.  Thanks
Oh yeah,  I realize that this isn't the right place for this but I imagine
there are probably more than a few Vanagon owner's out there who brew their
own beer.  I was wondering if any of you have have a good recipe for Bass
Ale.  Thanks again.
