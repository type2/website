Subject: Vehicle Recall

Dear Ron ,

I have read the gas tank leak issues, and have this on my 91 Vanagon. I
feel that the time has come, if it has not already been done to officially
notify the NHTSA.  I found the correct web site address.
http://www-nsa.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/voq_form.shtml.  I couldn't get to the form
page tonight, but felt that I should mention it to the list, before I do.
I've pasted the text of the revelant web page below.  I guess it would be
helpful to &quot;gather&quot; all &quot;safety related issues&quot; and post them at one time.
If a volunteer is needed I'm available etc.

Sincerely
Mark Keller
91' Carat WLE &quot;And no wanting to be Rocket Man???&quot;

YOUR CALL CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE

       The toll-free Auto Safety Hotline is your chance to help identify
safety problems in motor vehicles, tires and
       automotive equipment such as child safety seats, or get safety
information.
       The Hotline is run by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of
       Transportation.

WHY BOTHER?

       Your call or electronic submissions help lead to recalls. You
provide the first information we use to identify safety
       problems.
       We review your complaint and compare it to other complaints. If a
trend develops, it prompts us to open an
       investigation.
       We also let the manufacturer know about your complaint and sometimes
that leads to a settlement for you.

WHAT YOU GET

       You can either download or Hotline operators can send you
information on motor vehicle safety recalls including
       recalls of child safety seats.
       You can also receive a postage-paid questionnaire so you can provide
more detailed information about your
       complaint and return it to us.
       Alternatively, this questionnaire is available on-line.
       We'll send you a follow-up letter letting you know when your safety
concern has prompted a recall.

HOW YOUR CALL HELPS

       If a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle or item of
motor vehicle equipment, the manufacturer has to fix it at
       no cost to the owner. We use the information from your calls and WWW
form submissions to get the process
       started.

HOW TO CALL

       The toll-free Hotline number (800) 424-9393 can be reached from
anywhere in the United States including Alaska,
       Hawaii, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
       Hotline operators are on duty Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to
10 p.m. Eastern time. An answering system is
       set up 24 hours a day, seven days a week to get your name, number
and request. Fax-on-demand is also available.
       If you are calling from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the
number is (202) 366-0123.
       A Spanish-speaking operator is available weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. Eastern time.
       The Hotline is available to the hearing impaired through a
teleprinter (TDD) number: (800) 424-9153. In the
       washington, D.C. area the TDD number is (202) 366-7800.

HOW THE RECALL PROCESS WORKS

       We do not have to receive a set number of reports before we look
into a problem. We gather all available information
       on a problem. That is why your calls are important to us.
       Government engineers analyze the problem. If warranted, the
manufacturer is asked to conduct a recall.
       If the manufacturer does not initiate a recall, the government can
order the manufacturer to do a recall.

EXAMPLE OF SAFETY DEFECTS

       Safety-related defects are problems that exist in a vehicle or a
part of its equipment that:
           1.pose an unreasonable risk to safety and
           2.are common to a group of vehicles of the same design or
manufacture or items of equipment of the same
              type and manufacture.
       Examples Include:
              Steering components that may break suddenly causing partial
or complete loss of vehicle control;
              Complete or partial loss of brakes;
              Problems with fuel systems that results in a fuel leak that
could cause a fire;
              Improperly designed or constructed tires that may blow out
unexpectedly;
              Accelerator controls that may break or stick;
              Wiring problems that result in a fire or loss of lighting;
              Car ramps or jacks that collapse causing injury to someone
working on a vehicle, or
              Buckles on child safety seats that release in a crash.

       Some problems that would not be considered safety-related defects:
              Air conditioners and radios that don't work properly;
              Routine engine or transmission malfunctions that provide
ample warning of failure through noise, vibration
              and fluid leakage;
              Ordinary wear of items that have to be inspected, maintained
and replaced periodically, such as shock
              absorbers, batteries, brake pads and shoes and exhaust systems;
              Nonstructural or body panel rust.

IF WE CAN'T HELP YOU
Our Hotline concentrates on safety problems. If your problem is not safety
related, we'll help you by directing you to the
right government agency that can help. For example, the Federal Trade
Commission handles inquiries on automobile
warranties and problems with dealers. The FTC number is (202) 326-2222. The
Environmental Protection Agency is
responsible for emission control systems. If you have an emission problem,
call the EPA at (202) 260-7645. For a brochure
on fuel economy ratings, which is handled by the EPA and the Department of
Energy, call (202) 260-2080.
