Hi All

I was looking for a source for RV furnaces and a propane setup for my
Westy, and I came across the following on the 'Web.  Having followed 
Bob Hoover's spray insulation discussions, I was wondering if this
insulation (TEMP-COAT) could keep us from foaming at the mouth and
keep up warm at the same time.  Any ideas about this?

All the usual disclaimers apply - I never even heard of these folks
before.  The URL that I've reproduced here (sans hotlinks) is:

III. DESCRIPTION 

TEMP-COAT is a general purpose insulation which comes in liquid form,
available in regular and non-combustible formulation. TEMP-COAT
provides an inexpensive alternative to the high cost of industrial
insulation. Because it physically adheres to the surface that it is
insulating, it significantly reduces corrosion and rust formation. Its
use can greatly reduce the costs of other materials and increase the
size of an interior space by eliminating the thickness of interior
walls required to accomodate insulation. Its use reduces both space and
weight for any given structure or piece of equipment.

Make Up: TEMP-COAT is a complete mixture of various silicas and ceramic
beads immersed in a high quality latex base with acrylic binders. This
combination of materials makes the product extremely lightweight and
pliable, therefore, it expands and contracts with the surface to which
it is applied. The resiliency of TEMP-COAT allows it to double as a
leak stop even though it is not sold or warranted for that purpose.

Other Properties: TEMP-COAT can be tinted to virtually any medium to
pastel color and the tinting does not affect the radiant effectiveness
of the product.

Product Quality. TEMP- COAT works well on both convective and
conductive heat and cold. When used in ways not requiring solar
reflective qualities, its effectiveness has different values. Unlike
conventional insulation such as fiberglass batting, blankets, foam,
fiber insulations, or calcium silicate type pre-formed insulation for
piping, TEMP-COAT is impervious to water and is not affected by salt
water. It forms a continuous covering, not sectioned, like an installed
product. It also forms an excellent weatherproof coating over other
forms of insulation.

Product Limits: TEMP-COAT aids in sealing leaks but is not sold as a
leak-stop material. Product must be applied over a clean, dry, grease
and dirt fee substrate. Operating temperatures can be from -45 F to 550
F. It can be applied from temperatures ranging from 45 F to 550 F. On
extremely warm to hot surfaces, beginning coats must be thin to avoid
blistering.

IV. APPLICATION

Apply TEMP-COAT on a dry, clean, substrate which is free from oil,
grease, wax or dirt. Apply by use of spray equipment. Spray equipment
requirement: 1.25 GPM, 28:1 ratio airless sprayer with a
.021 tip size. Allow product to dry between coats. This is a one coat
system with curing time of 24 hours under normal conditions. Brush or
roller may be used for touch up, but is not recommended for full
application.

Approximate Coverage: Spray: 60 SF per gallon at 15 mil thickness on a
flat surface.

Clean-Up: TEMP-COAT is a latex based product. Clean up immediately
after use with soap and water. Caution:: Use drop cloth and necessary
protection to prevent damage from drips or overspray under windy
conditions.

V. TEST RESULTS

TEMP-COAT has been tested under a number of varying conditions to
produce an &quot;R&quot; factor equivalence.

ACCORDING TO TEST RESULTS, TEMP-COAT WHEN APPLIED TO A THICKNESS OF 15
MILS (15 thousands of an inch), PERFORMS AS WELL AS A 4&quot; THICKNESS OF
FOAM WITH AN R-20 RATING.

&quot;R&quot; FACTOR EQUIVALENCE 
NOTE: Due to the absence of air flow, an &quot;R&quot; factor cannot be used and
all tests are performed comparing the usefulness of this insulation
with an &quot;R&quot; Factor Equivalence.

The product has also undergone a number of ASTM tests as follows:
FLAMMABILITY RESULTS TEST METHOD
Flame Spread 5 ASTM E-84
Smoke Developed 5

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES: 
Cross Hatch Adhesion l00% ASTM-3359
Tensile Strength(lb/iný)66.7% ASTM D-882
Elongation 65%

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES: 
Accelerated Aging: Passed 200 Hours ASTM G-53 
Density (g/cm3)
AT 24c dried film 0.41 ASTM D-792
Weight per Gallon (in lbs. per gal) 5.94
Weight, Non-volatiles 43%
Brookfield Viscosity

(via guarded hotplate)

VI. OTHER EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES

TEMP-COAT , in addition to its outstanding insulating qualities and
superior adhesion, has low flame spread, is impact and abrasion
resistant, is flexible and protects coated surfaces from ponding water,
wind driven rain, cold-heat cycling, chemical vapors, and mildew. These
qualities make it the standard in ceramic coatings.

VII. SHIPPING AND SUPPLY METHOD

TEMP-COAT is available FOB from the point of manufacture in Georgia.

VIII. WARRANTY

Limited Warranty: SPAN WORLD DISTRIBUTION, div. of Southern
Professional Leasing, Inc., warrants TEMP-COAT as an insulation under
normal use and installation conditions for a period of ten years from
the date of application. Complete warranty information is available
upon request.

TEMP-COAT IS A FEDERALLY APPROVED LIQUID INSULATION AND COATING
MATERIAL. NATIONAL STOCK NUMBER; NSN 8030-01-387-1027.

IX. PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

Rooftop installation: 15 mil thickness can reduce under roof
temperatures by 20F- 50F.

Boiler installation: Actual installations have shown that a 60 mil
thickness of Temp-Coat can reduce exterior boiler wall temperatures
from over 400F to less than 200F.

RV Installation: 15 mil thickness applied to exterior roof top can
provide insulation equal to an R20 insulation factor.
