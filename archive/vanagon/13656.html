Excerpts from internet.listserv.vanagon: 19-Mar-95 washer nozzle by
David Carment_at_ccs_dot_carlet 
&gt;  
&gt; Has anyone removed the windshield washer nozzle on a vanagon? One of ours
&gt; is plugged and it needs to be cleaned from the inside out....TIA - DC
&gt;  

Try sticking your finger over the non-plugged one (thus allowing all
the pumps pressure to work against the restriction)
It worked for me.
