VW EV Conversion Manual - use an old VW chassis to make your own electric
car...

Full schematics, blueprints, and many photos.  Information on series and
parallel hybrids, batteries, motors, adaptor plates, controllers, relays,
wiring and optional fiberglass bodies.  If you're in California, with the
tax credits, you can convert a VW for less than $700.  100 pages.  $25.
Author is Ron Kaylor.  

===============================
I recognize the name of Ron Kaylor - in fact, I think I even met him long time
ago (outside the Redwood City Ice Rink) when I owned my two tone electric
Green  '73 van.  Ron has been into electric cars for a LONG time.
