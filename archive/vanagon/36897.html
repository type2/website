Subject:       Re: Headlight oddity

&gt; The headlights on the V6anagon (sorry to cause offense, Jim) have been
&gt; acting a little strange: after being on for 1/2 hour or so during a
&gt; long night trip, they lose power. Later they come back on, and then go
&gt; off again, etc.

Two words:  Chevy alternator.

J/K.

Not that it is of any value, but I wired up my radio the other 
month, and whenever I turned on the windshield wipers my radio would 
go off and on!  

So I made sure last Saturday when I was installing the new CD 
player, that I wouldn't have the same problem. 
I got out the voltmeter, and with the ignition off found a live 12v.
Hooked it all up.

It worked great.  Went into the house, did whatnot and decided to go 
for a drive.  No power to the stereo when I tried it again!

I thought, oh well, and took off, thinking I'd fix it later.  That 
night on my way home, I tried it again to see if it would perchance 
work.  Yup!  Worked great.

Huh?  Turn off lights.  Off goes radio!  Turn on lights, on goes 
radio!

Seems I had the headlights on when I was testing for an always live 
line to hook into!

As Homer would say...  &quot;D'OH!&quot;

BTW, Steve, I found a new engine for you to put into your Vanagon.  
That cool Audi W-12!  It might fit!  &lt;grin&gt;
