Sounds like fun:-( Hope you had plenty of beer on hand.Thanks a bunch for the
recommendations. I will need a lot of rubber and thought about RMMW.

More on &quot;Urge&quot;: I finally got really pissed about the whole situation. Called
the shop AGAIN, got the anes machine AGAIN, left a message. &quot;A rollback will
be there in the AM to pick her up&quot;. That call was returned. :-)

Promised to be ready on Friday or there will be no charge on the stuff done
so far. Wish me luck.
