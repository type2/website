&quot;Sounds scammy to me, but for $20 bucks is it worth cutting your fuel 
line? 
Get a tune up instead.
&quot;


whoa!! no one has to cut up their fuel line!! (ok.ok..i admit, i havent 
looked at the refered to product..butsince no onehas told me i assumed 
wrong about it being the magnetic device, i continue to make an ass out 
of u and me...:)



it slips right on your fuel line, and colects some minerals that may be 
good, and may be bad..

but, according to that artical i remmebr, (NOT a payperad, btw..a 
statemnt from an editor..ok, THE editor, of the magizine..)

what the device does is the strong e-mag fields, from rare earth magnets, 
provide a charge to the gas, which then shifts its hydrocarbons around, 
into a smoother form, that supposedly ionizes better..

now...dont forget! e-mag fields can do any things...like cause you to see 
bright flashes of light INSIDE your head, if i turn this little device on 
that is legal to sell, build, or own..but not to use..

in the news all the time the effects of e-mag radiation..


anyhow.....david.._dot_used to read to much..
