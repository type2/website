Subject: Red Rock, air-races, hot tubs /f

	Gee- I can't wait to see the pictures!

	Rock hopping!?!? I guess I should have figured it.

	The Phoenix air races were neat, and Tony's GLI's new
Bilstien shocks work well, as does the 268 cam from Techtonics.
I got to try driving it and I liked it a lot. Didn't see many
type IIs, but the winning Unlimited air-racer was air-cooled.
Abet 4400 cubic inches of air-cooled :-) 450mph is WAY FAST.

	A friend of mine has a snorkel stove and says they're
great. Transporting hot rocks sounds problematic, but I like
the ethos of the found materials hot tub... just remember to put
some non-hot-rocks on the bottom to keep the hot ones off the
plastic tarp! One might get faster heat transfer from some
cans of heated sand, by pouring the hot sand into the water. 
Little 2-4 gallon galvanized steel pails could be used as
containers, and there wouldn't be any soot. It would work with
gravel too. I'm going to have to try this at the beach...
