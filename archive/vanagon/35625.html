Subject:  Type II pipes in air intakes 

My 1976 type II has some approx 1/4&quot; OD tubing that runs up and back in the
cooling air intakes (the vents on the side of the body behind the side 
windows). These have about 3/4&quot; x 6&quot; long 'swellings'  up in the 
cooling air intakes. They come down into the engine compartment, and
turn into plastic tubing, join a T fitting just above the engine back door
hinges. The output of the T fitting has about 3&quot; of plastic tubing travelling
forward along the ceiling of the engine comparment. The end of this tubing is
melted, and there is no sign of the rest of this tubing? I don't know where the
other ends of these two 'loops' of tubing goes?
What are they? What do they do? I assume they are some part of a pollution 
control? The van runs fine without them going anywhere?

RSVP Thanks
