&gt; couldn't help me because I didn't have periodic services performed by a

&gt; list got help from VW of A.  Were your periodic services done at a VW
&gt; dealership?

My 83 westy went through this route once last year. VWoA paid 75% of the
cost to fix the engine which had a leaky head gasket. The westy had leaky
heads. Luckily the previous owner left me a few work receipts by a local 
VW dealer indicating the westy had the problem at less than 30k miles. 
When I took the case to VWoA it was already at 70k miles at 12 years old.

You need to contact your local BBB office to file a compliant. Call your
local BBB and ask for Autoline. Then tell them the head gasket problem
and tell them it's a known manufacturing defect of VW. They will mail
you the forms to file a complaint. Once they receive your forms they will
contact VWoA and get a deal for you. Befor I contacted BBB I called VWoA
they refuse to do anything for me citing the age of the westy. But I provided
all reciepts to prove that it had the problem since 30K miles and finally
VWoA agreed to pay 75% of the cost to fix the engine.

The local VW dealer had the heads replaced with rebuild heads and had new
gaskets installed. I still paid $500+ for the bill because the total bill
was over $2500. I believe VWoA will offer a deal to you. In my case, they 
still collected $500+ from me. They did not lose much at all. The dealer
did a clean, good job for me.

The previous owner had the westy serviced a few times by dealers. But I
never took it back to any dealer. They never asked prove for services done
by dealers. So far I did all the work for both my 83 westy and 84 vanagon.
