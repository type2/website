Subject: Help! '80 Vanagon info!

Hey now,
        Friend's got a line on a '80 vanagon for $2500, says engine was
rebuilt 5000k ago, alternator busted. Sound like a good deal? He wants me
to help check it out, I can check compression &amp; what not, but are there any
specific things to look for on a 80? Are the compression readings different
from the uprights? Thanks in advance for any info (will search archives
later).

Peace,
