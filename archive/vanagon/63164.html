Hi Mike,

For the '71 Rustfalia I had all the rusted metal cut out and new metal
welded in. Prob'ly not what you want to hear, but...   The job started out
as intending to do a cheap &quot;cave and pave&quot; job, or as VanBondo likes to
call it, &quot;lick and stick&quot;, but you know how it goes. &quot;Well, maybe we'll
just do a little more while we're here...&quot;

Maybe you should try posting to the Type 2 list as well, prob'ly more
rustoration experience there.

Good luck!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Within the next week or so, I plan on undertaking the monumental task of
&gt; performing the necessary body work on my '84 westy.   This involves
pulling
&gt; a few dents, striping the body/seam rust off, and repainting.  Needless
to
&gt; say, I have no experience in performing this type of work, so any
&gt; information would be great.  More specifically, I was wondering about the
&gt; best way to take off the rust and if anyone knows of a 'less expensive'
&gt; paint sprayer that would work well.   Also, I have some (two very small
&gt; spots) rust forming under the rubber strip around one of the rear side
&gt; windows.  Has anyone taken out one of these windows to remove rust and if
so
&gt; how did you do it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike D.
