Subject: Re: Electric Van Conversions?


&gt;Where does one purchase an electric conversion? And how much does it cost?

All I know was learnt from a few articles in magazines. Doubtless they're
still in some heap here in this fire-trap, but I don't know where. I seem
to recall that to convert a Japanese sedan, it was something like $1000 for
the various gizmos and another $1000 for batteries. They can do something
like eighty miles on a charge with this. But don't quote me.

I think one of the better articles was in one of those magazines that cater
to people who want to move to the country and raise pigs--&quot;Backwoods Home&quot;
or &quot;Countryside &amp; Small Stock Journal&quot; or one of those. They're always
doing fascinating things in those magazines.

Once a guy made a still for the purpose of fermenting cow sh*t. He would
shovel cow flops into this little still and add water and let them rank,
and he rigged up a valved system to capture the methane in inner tubes.
Then he injected the methane into the throat of the carb on his lawn
tractor and rode around on it for about one minute until the tube went
flat.

All this was meticulously documented and diagrammed and photographed so
that I, the reader, could confidently go about building my own backyard
lawn tractor sh*t still if I wanted to. I just love those magazines. If you
did this with a Bus you could bring the cow with you. ;)

&gt; Has anyone in Vanagon land done a conversion?

Apparently somebody converted a Microbus. Something about it on the web?

&gt;I've been thinking about it, but haven't done any investigating.

I do know there's a page called &quot;The Alternative Energy Home Page,&quot; or
something like that. Please share it if you find anything good.
