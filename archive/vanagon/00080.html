I also recently did front door rubber (on a '71 as well! :-) from J.C.
Whitney, and I have a few comments:

cc&gt; one place where I was puzzled. The rubber includes a hole for the
cc&gt; limiting strap but I was not tearing apart my door to do the
cc&gt; limiting strap. So I cut the gasket diagonally, slipped it around,

If you look at the other end (not in the door - the end at the body)
there is a way out.  I don't recall exactly now and the bus is at
home, but I think there was a pin that I knocked out, allowing the
limiting strap to come free of the body. Putting it back was a mildly
tricky matter of realigning it and then putting the pin back.

Having skipped the glue on the rubber, you can make this part easy by
fitting the rubber in place (friction will hold it, mostly) and
pulling segments out, applying the glue, and putting them back. 

cc&gt; JC Whitney rubber was what I used. I do not usually use thier
[...]
cc&gt; guys. If I was doing a show car installation, I would not have
cc&gt; even considered it. But I consider my VW a transportation vehicle
cc&gt; that just happens to be 'way-cool' and a hobby. The JCW rubber
cc&gt; wont last another 22 years, but if I get 10 out of it, I will be
cc&gt; ahead of the game.

Ditto.  I figured I could put in 3 JCW seals for the price of a good
one :-) [not my usual mode of operation, but since it's not out in the
sun and all, I figgered I'd give it a try.]

cc&gt; Next on the project list: The granddaddy of all rubber---The
cc&gt; sliding door seal. (And mabye a new windsheild gasket too.) But
cc&gt; first those cylinder heads.

Oh my!  If you should find a cheap acceptable source for those (even
Whitney wants hundreds of dollars, as I recall), we'll be glad to hear
it.  Me? I'm thinking hard about fabricating something myself....
