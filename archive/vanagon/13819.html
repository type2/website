Subject: Drove my '66:-)


For the second time ever (the first time was when I drove it home...leaking
lots of bodily fluids; the bus, not me) I have driven my bus. 

Man I like that:-)

Only problem that I could detect (I was only doing about 20 mph)
was that braking would cause the bus to pull left big time.  
Braking to turn left was like having power steering:-)  Turning right was
another story.
