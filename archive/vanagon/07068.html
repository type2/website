&gt;nothing.  Can someone tell me what the front SHOULD do?  Does moving the
&gt;lever pull the upper (rectangular) part of the latch BACK, or does it
&gt;just push the hook up.  I can't imagine what might have broken here.

before you spend lots of money on new parts, get some wd-40 and spray the
hell out of the latching mechanism. my 88 did that and it was just the grease
on the latching gizmos freezing up in cold weather (and it is rather cold
up there, right?).  about a half-can of wd-40 later, it was working fine ...
and hasn't done it again. :)

and, just in case it really is something wrong, your 84 is the last year of
that type latching mechanism ... the 85's have a redesigned door mechanism
that is 'easier' to open/close, with part of the mechanism at the rear of
the sliding door.  just so you don't get the wrong one from a junk yard. ;)
