&lt;&lt; PS: when you get time could you post the EXACT details of your EURO tuning
 of the vanagons, I now have a 1.9 and 2.1 so whatever you have would be
 appreciated.   &gt;&gt;
Tim I will get together a file with the settings including the new timing
marks for the flywheel, and send them to you. I need some new rubber for my
syncro.I was out in the woods climbing a steep grade here yesterday and could
use more rubber contact on the soil(I currently have skinny 195-14 on them
now).
CAVEAT: For OFF Road Use Only!....Dennis is this OK?
