&gt;&gt;   Thom...why don't you order a Gene Berg dip stick thermo.?  They are cheap,
&gt;    very accurate and connect to your oil light.._dot_causing it to flicker when
&gt;    the temp. starts to get high (225-227 degrees).  The part # is GB227a-228
&gt;    depending on year of bus.  Gene Berg is at (714) 998-7500

i would concur about the gene berg doodad, they are tres cheap and are
worth it IMHO. Better than spending $$$$$$$$$ for all of the VDO guages

(FWIW I have a full set of VDO guages and senders that I have misplaced - D'oh!)
