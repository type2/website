Subject: 90 Carat overheating
Date: Mon, 20 Jan 1997 20:35:31 -0700

Is there an archive summarizing causes of running hot in Vanagons that
anyone is aware of.  My '90 has 105k on it, new water pump and heads at
55k, and has never run hot until last couple months.  I am having
radiator flushed and thermostat changed, but am not sure this will
actually help.  Heat seems to be about right for effectiveness.  Has not
been eating antifreeze.  Runs strong, but when warmed up seems like
turbo lag on acceleration; i.e., slow response from low revs unless you
really put your foot into it.  This is not the case when engine is cold.
 Recent plugs, cap, rotor, trip to Florida from Chicago with 4 kids and
wife.

I read about cavatating on water pump, and wonder if effectiveness has
been diminished? Any way to check?

Thanks for any help-
Ed
