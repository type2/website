Subject: Rear window defogger, '81 Vanagon



   I've just started using my rear window defogger (the electric grid)
   and I've noticed that only one &quot;line&quot; in the grid appears to be
   working.

   Has anyone ever looked tried looking at the defroster to see how it's
   wired?

   Is the grid one long line of resistive wire with current flowing
   through it from one end to the other?  If this is the case, then my
   defogger is OK and for some reason frost is melting faster on one
   line of the grid then the others.

   Or is the grid really a bunch of resistive wires in parallel, such
   that one (or more) of the lines would work, even if the others aren't
   working?

   The wiring diagram suggest the defogger is one long resistive wire.
