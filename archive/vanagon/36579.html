Subject: VW Announces Concept II /f

For Immediate Release              Friday, February 30, 1996

Volkswagen of America announced today that it will reintroduce
the classic VW bus to America.

Like the famously popular Concept I car, based on the VW Beetle 
and modern VW/Audi Components, the Concept II Microbus will combine the 
best of old and new. The body will be based on the original Type II VW 
Transporter, and was penned by a special California VW design team,
based near Sacramento. There will be three engines offered, a 
turbocharged, 227 hp 5 cylinder engine currently in production for the 
VWAG Audi S6 wagon, as well as both air and water-cooled flat-fours.
The water-cooled four will feature a 200,000 mile powertrain warranty.

The Concept II Microbus will be  assembled in Mexico, which has a long 
tradition of preserving Volkswagen history. Production there will keep 
costs down, and VW will sell the Concept II for $14,000.

The prototype Concept II Microbus was built by a special VW engineering 
team, and then sent to Sweden for testing. It recent arrived in the United
States, and will begin a tour of the US autoshows shortly after some 
shipping damage is repaired. A photograph of the new Concept II is 
available for viewing at: http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/54dlx5.jpg

Dealers have already begun taking orders for the Concept II.
Cyberspace VW, the only VW dealer on the INTERNET, reported
that it recieved over 500 orders for the Concept II Microbus
within minutes of opening its new web site.
