&gt;
&gt;Wow, really cool, thanks for the info! 
&gt;
&gt;BTW: What compression ratio are you going to run in this motor? Since 
&gt;you've got such a nice cool running motor now, I thought maybe you might 
&gt;run something reasonable like 9.8:1.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You're  pretty close. I think it will be right at 9.5:1. These engines are
built for longevity so we don't get too  radical on CR. I don't even use
100% race fuel. We generally add 60% unleaded super to 30% 104 trick fuel.
We install a 5th head stud on each of the cylinders to help keep things
sealed up.
   I have been thinking more about the corrosion problem. If you ceramic
coat the heads where they generally corrode, will the corrosion just move on
to somewhere else. Could there be electrolosis at work here?  The way it
works in boats is that you install a piece of zink in the outdrive or
transom of the boat. This a sacrificial plate. It just corrodes away and
everything else isn't bothered. I think they put zink plates in the cooling
systems of boats to keep corrosion from the exhaust manifolds (always a
problem) and other places the coolant touches. If we put a zink plate
somewhere in the coolant of the bus would that help?
    Deisel trucks use different products in the coolant to keep corrosion
and rust away. My neighbor puts Norcool in  his dump truck and when he got a
84 Vanagon he started useing it in there. He hasn't had the heads off(140000
mi). I understand redline now has something on the market. I belive Bently
says the factory put something into the coolant. I think that is where I
read it. Anybody have any knowlage of additives?
