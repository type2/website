&gt;...          Also, I propose that we adopt &quot;UrineVan&quot; as the list-approved
&gt;slang for the latest generation of bus.  Good one, Wizzer!

now, now, children. :)  as much as i like a good phrase, i'm afraid that the
Urinevan name just doesn't fit. all the other nicknames (split-window,
bread-loaf/bay-window, brick) refer to an external feature or the shape of
the bus. besides ... EuroVans don't come in yellow in this country. ;)

so we have to come up with a phrase/word/nickname that is DESCRIPTIVE of the
van, relates to its shape. what does it remind you of when you see it? that
sort of name.

so what does a Eurovan look like?  well, it ain't a loaf of bread. it ain't
a brick. it's rounded, tall, and has a short nose. hmmmmm. i'm not getting
any ideas here. anybody else?
