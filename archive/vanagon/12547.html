&gt;The 914/6 had a variation of the '72 911T 2.4L engine--without
&gt;MFI, I belive.  If you are interested, I could look up the
&gt;specs and email you.  (I have a '72 911T.)

Well! Looks like we have 3 versions of the 914/6: 2.0L, 2.2 (me) and 2.4L!

I think this is legit, though, 'cause they were made over a perdiod of time.

Surprised nobody has mentioned the 912E, which is the opposite of a 914/6 -
a 914 in a 911 chassis!  Sorry, 1976 ONLY!

I too have a 72T, with MFI, a targa even!  '72 is the _coolest_ year 
because of the external oil flap!
