Subject: South Carolina Salvage Yards?

ok all you type II freaks...

I am going to be traveling to Columbia, SC on Monday January 16 to
follow up on a barndoor bus lead and I was wondering if anyone
could point me toward any junk yards in the area where I could
pick up spare parts for my ever growing fleet.  (My goal is to have
a different DRIVEABLE vw for each day of the week!)

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Dave
