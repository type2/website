Subject: Drove the TDI today... :)

No, not a TDI bus, I'm afraid...

But I got tired of waiting for the TDI Jettas to arrive, and I've 
been reading about this engine for a few years now, so I tried a 
Passat TDI.

This is one kickbutt diesel engine! It seemed almost too quiet, in fact, 
only a trained ear could tell it as a diesel. And the power... I was 
amazed - I was going 130km/h on the highway on-ramp when I looked
down, without really pushing it! And this was a Passat Wagon, which 
must be well over 3000lbs.

This would be the ultimate diesel conversion for a Vanagon, 
especially a Syncro - and it shouldn't be that tough - seems to be 
about the same layout as the old TD. 
I guess the tough part will be finding one...
