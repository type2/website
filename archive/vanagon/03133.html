&gt; As the engine gets warm, the bus loses power.  I took off nice and strong,
&gt; and by the time I got 1/2 mile or so, it was already getting weak.   By
&gt; weak I mean there is no power - I feel like I should get out and walk along 
&gt; side to make it easier on the bus!  It will take 5-10 seconds to get 
&gt; enough speed to go from 1st to 2nd gear, and when you get there, you kinda
&gt; wonder if you should'nt have bothered, as the engine just groans under the
&gt; strain.  7 year old kids on bikes are passing me!  No, REALLY!

Sounds like your exhaust might be plugged.  Kinda unusual on vehicles
without catalytic converters, but it might be worth your time to check it
out.  Loosen the connection between the heat exchangers and the muffler
to create a sizeable exhaust leak, and take it for a spin...

&gt; Another nugget of info.  When I put fresh ait heater boxes on a while
&gt; back, there was a pile of dirt about 6&quot; high between #3 &amp; #4.  Seriously!
&gt; We had to chisel it out.  Strangely, the compression on #3 was 115, #4
&gt; was 103, and 1 &amp; 2 were 92 each... Hmmm.    I re-torqued the head on 1 &amp; 2,
&gt; but I haven't re-checked the compression.

I would do that right away...
