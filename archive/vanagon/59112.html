&gt;My '80 Westy had this &quot;Fukengruven&quot; bumper sticker - just like the

&gt;took it off!  Now that she's a worldly 6-year old, i wish still had it. Can
&gt;anyone out there tell me where to find one, or does anyone have an extra to
&gt;sell?

I saw a new one the other day... 'Fukenstroken' with the stick figure
experiencing self-pleasure :-).&gt;&gt;

I was at a Volkswagon show this past weekend and they had stickers that read
&quot;Fukenbroken&quot; with a figure holding a wrench.
