Subject: My clean garage..idle hands, devil's tools etc


I got two responses to my offer of the free heater boxes that I found while
cleaning the garage. How do I choose the winner? Any suggestions? A
quiz... What is your favourite colour etc?

So I have this new found space to work in, so what do I do? I yank the
engine out of my ol' '72 westy that I decided to keep.

I figured that it would be easier to replace all of those rotting rubber
bits and tighten-up this and that if the engine was on the floor!?

As I suspected most of the rubber in the central idling system is cracked,
there is dirt and leaves under the tin, but the only oil leak I can see is
from one of the valve covers.

But I have a question: my heater boxes are rusty and thin at the point
where the exhaust exits and joins the extractor/muffler. I have heard
people on this list talk about about brazing the boxes but I'm afraid that
the void is too big to span with braze and that the box material is too thin.
Does anybody have any other solutions? Some sort of very heat resistant
flexible putty?

I'll keep the list posted on my progress with this self imposed bit of
penance.

Alistair
