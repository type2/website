_______________________________________________________________________________
	So I'm sitting here at home absolutely _seething_!  I called him
up with a chat program we had and just casually asked what was up
&quot;Just working on Neptune (another machine)&quot; blah blah blah.  &quot;Oh,&quot; sez
I, &quot;I noticed that you were looking at my mailbox&quot;  Long, long pause, the
&quot;we'll talk about it Monday...&quot;

	I was _pissed_, so I hopped in the car and went down to the office
to get my stuff.  By the time I got there, I went to log in, and my account
was locked.  Now I was _really_ pissed!  It was all I could do to restrain
myself from downing the machine, booting with the install tape and do
some serious damage! (BTW - due to the massive amounts of data they deal with
(40-60G) they only back up small portions of it... _very_ vulnerable)

   Don't ya just LOVE those InfoNazi tactics? Especially the way a
   &quot;termination&quot; is dealt with: nobody talks!!! I sure hope that no
   one out there drives a VW and works in HR... doesn't seem to add
   up!!!
