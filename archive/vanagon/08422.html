Howdy,

	I need someone to refresh my memory here:

	I'm getting ready to replace the trans in my '56 kombi.  I've done this
before.  Once.  A year ago.  

	What I can't remeber is how far I have to disassemble the axle tube/
reduction gear assemblies to move them to the new transmission.  When I did
the last one, we had to remove a lot to get to the plastic flowers inside,
which were melted on the new transmission (it was from my '67)

	Any help here would be uh, helpful :)  I nned to know to kinda estimate
how long this will take.

Thom
