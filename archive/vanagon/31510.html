Subject: Vanagon owner's manuals

I followed up on a couple of sources for owner's manuals that were shown on a
web page(the names escape me now) and found that none of the 3 had anything
for the 81 camper. One of these in Pa. however, referred me to Barry J.
Schiff in Rhode Island who had both the manual and the camper supplement. As
with most original items it was expensive at $35 + postage but awfully nice
to have.

BTW, Gary Shea was kind enough to pass along the phone and address for
European American RV products as the original maker of the water and power
ports. Today however, I found that number answered by a puzzled hispanic
individual somewhere in N. Hollywood and information shows no current
listing. Anybody have any updates?
