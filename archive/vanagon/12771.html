Subject: Engine transplants

I went back into my old magazines over the weekend and decided to forward
some of the articles that inflamed my desire to put wrong engines in buses.
This is the oldest, I think, which means it took me over ten years to act
on the dream.  Photos in this article are of a refrigerator-white 72 panel
with a massive chin spoiler (down to about 4 in off the road) and wheel
well flairs.  Just makes you wonder what class it would race in.

Turbo Bus
 
VW &amp; Porsche
 
September/October 1982
 
     Perhaps the most important ingredient to a successful
automotive project is the dedication of the builder. Except for
the most simple bolt-on applications, working on improving a
car's basic design or performance requires long hours, great
patience and an ability to adapt to the unforeseen. Otherwise,
the damn car stays in the garage, surrounded by loose parts.
 
     One of the finest examples we've seen of a builder's
dedication to a final design goal is this 1972 VW Bus, created
by Mike Karbacher. Mike has owned the car since '72, and about
four years ago became determined to modernize the dependable but
staid van. Little did Mike suspect that it would take him four
years to complete the car, but his criteria for a good job is so
demanding that he made over many of the modifications at least
three times.
 
     The most obvious changes to the stock Bus are included in a
kit available from Karbacher Prototype, 1107 S. Flower St.,
Burbank, CA 91502; (213) 845-6239. The front air dam, front
fenders, rocker panels, rear fenders, all bolts and brackets,
light covers, one set of fogs and one set of running lights, a
front bumper bar and turn signals are all a part of the basic
kit. Alone, these pieces are enough to change the most homely
bus into a racey machine, but Mike didn't want a mere bolt-on
changeover. For something different, Mike fitted a '77 2.7-liter
turboed 911 engine.
 
     To keep all that power under control, Mike worked hard on
beefing up the suspension of the Bus. He began by lowering the
front of the car about three inches, and then fitted Addco
anti-sway bars and Koni shocks, front and rear. Because of the
suspension drop, the car understeers slightly, but that is
handied easily using the throttle. Three-piece BBS 16x10-inch
wheels sport Pirelli 225/50 VR-16 P-7 tires, and the resulting
handling is absolutely superb. Top speed for the Bus is about
110 mph, and it is rock solid up to that point. Different
gearing could undoubtedly coax some more top end from the car.
 
     Mike stayed with the stock Bus brakes, finding them more
than adequate. The front air dam slots are functional, directing
cooling air to the front brakes.
 
     For power, Mike went to a junkyard and bought the 911
motor. A great deal of engine work was required to get it into
running shape, and then Mike started on the turbo installation.
He used the BAE/Rajay setup with water injection, and it has
worked well for him. He runs seven pounds of boost with the
barest hint of detonation at full throttle under load. That
could be dealt with in the future by the addition of an
auxiliary fuel supply system. Mike estimates the engine puts out
about 225 horsepower.
 
     Engine cooling is achieved through the installation of an
extra cooler in the right rear wheelwell. Panels in the rear
fenders show the location of the cool air intake. Even under the
worst conditions the engine runs a cool 210 degrees F. The oil
system is a 12.5-quart drysump setup with braided steel lines in
all the right places.
 
     The engine was mounted using a special custom bracket built
by Mike, and it was mated to the stock VW trans using an adapter
plate from Kennedy Engineering. Kennedy also supplied a
reinforced VW clutch that is able to handle all the extra power.
 
     The interior is as well done as the outside of the Bus.
Mike fabricated a Rosewood gauge platform, fitting 911 oil level
and fuel level gauges, and also using aftermarket VDO gauges.
It's a very clean setup and very easy to read. The steering
wheel is a Raid Turbo design from Racemark, and good sounds are
provided by the Blaupunkt 3001 stereo cassette with four ADS
speakers. Seating is the superior Recaro with jet-striping
fabric.
 
     The amount of work that Mike has put into this prototype is
really the only negative attached to the project. But the
finished car and the driving pleasure it gives more than makes
up for the years of effort. Fuel economy is quite good at
between 15-20 mpg, and the engine maintenance is easily
accomplished because of the accessibility of the Bus's rear
hatch. Recent zero to 60 times netted Mike a best of 6.48
seconds!  This is an automobile that not only looks fast, it
also drives fast. The kit described earlier retails for around
$1600. Contact Karbacher Prototype for the full story.
 
 
 
Reminds me of how much I miss VW&amp;Porsche magazine as it was in the old
days.
