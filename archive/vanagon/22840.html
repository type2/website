&gt;&gt; Ben Franklin drove a '69 Type 2??? Always knew that dude was smart.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Wonder where he bought parts?
&gt;
&gt;Must have been that 1769 model.Wasn't that the one where you could tell
&gt;the horse power just by counting?


That's the one. And, split windshield was the result of a backfire.
But at least the heater worked just as well as &quot;modern&quot; ones!
