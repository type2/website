Subject: Safaris?

Hello peoples....

Justr scanning through the list, and I realized that I don't know what safari 
windows are...I thought they were those oval things on the sides of the 
roof(usually matched with a ragtop)...I guess they are actually those slatted 
roll operable side windows?  If so, then what the bleedin' 'ell are them oval 
windows on a 23-window bus called?

Just curious....
