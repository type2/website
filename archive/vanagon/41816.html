&gt; 1968-69     Pearl White
&gt; 1970-71     Pearl White
&gt;             Titian Red
&gt; 1972        Pearl White

I think it would be save to add that light blue color (whatever it's 
called) to the list for '71's, since that's what my van's original color 
was. I'm certain it's an original Westy, but I can check further for 
verification if anyone wants me to. Please don't tell me I have the one 
rare light blue westy for which there's been a $20,000 bounty for years; 
I just painted her a different color. =0 Joe

i believe it's Dove Blue, VW's longest running colour.   barndoor  to eurovan
(wouldn't that be a good picture?), kombis, panels, campers, trucks, all yr
commercial vehicles could be Dove Blue.   ;*)

sorry, though, i saw a lovely dove blue 64 westy, with the other style
interior, i dont remember the code, not SO44 or SO42 .  the one with the
chunky cabinet with oval doors on the cargo door.   (help me here)
