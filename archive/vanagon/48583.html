Subject: Dan Houg's tent resto
Date: 	Wed, 21 Aug 1996 12:48:28 -0400

I finally scanned in the pics that Dan sent me (thanks Dan!) of how he
repro'ed the top poles of the tent frame that were missing on his 1970's
era VW Add-A-Room so that he could use the tent w/ his 1987 Westy. A fine
job indeed!

I did a very cusory stab at html'ing at  at http://www.utoronto_dot_ca/gpu/mheron
the pictures of Dan's pole resto are right at the bottom of the page. Hope
the pics are big enough to give people an idea of how he did it. I will try
and make the page look better when I have some time. I have been told that
the page takes a while too load, so you might wanna be patient. The jpeg
pics are about ~100K each
