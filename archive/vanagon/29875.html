Hi David...
Don't worry about it...  I'm glad your trip went OK.  I took a laptop
with me, and did not print your e-mails thinking I could access them
anytime, so I could get hold of your Hotel's phone number from
directory assistance.  Unfortunately we ended up staying in a hotel
with a phone system that was incompatible with 28.8 modems!!!
(somebody staying in the hotel had 2400 baud, and was using it OK!!!),
anyway, It turns out I forgot the hotel you're staying at, and could
not look it up.

It could be that we stayed at a very close-by hotel (Residence Inn at
Kissimmee), there was a Comfort Inn right around the corner.

As to our trip, I survived 8 days of theme parks, a Ford Contour with
two kids complaining of a cramped small car (I actually did not mind
the Contour -- until I heard the price tag for a new one!! they have
to be out of their minds to think they can sell those things for
$15,500 or more!), and I think I put more miles on my shoes than on
the Ford Contour!

For me, the technology used in the parks was somewhat disappointing,
with the exception of a few rides.  Sea World was (as always)
attractive because of the animals, but it happened that police
departments all over Florida had chosen that day as a good excuse to
display their 'crime figthing' equipment, which was IMHO done in a
very tasteless way.  One of the highligts was the laser/holographic
show at the end of the day, which, I think was better than the ones at
other theme parks.

My highlight was the visit to Kennedy Space Center, we had a perfect
day there. 

As to the VW content, we left Florida 7:30 AM Saturday (with temps
already in 70's), and arrived at Allentown 12:30 P.M. to 35 degrees
fahrenheit. The '87 weekender started right up, and when the two other
families we were traveling together had trouble finding taxis, all 12
of us (6 adults/6 kids) and all of the baggage crammed ourselves into
it.  Fortunately, the drive to the first family's home was only 4.5
miles, and after that everyone had a seat belt...

The '87 felt very soft on the brakes with 12 people + luggage, but I
did not notice any big difference in the power -- I really babied the
accelerator, though....

 &gt; I'm sorry I did not contact you while at Disney, but I was out voted on
 &gt; anything that did not involve Disney, Disney, or the other members of my
 &gt; travelling group.  Maybe next time, eh?
