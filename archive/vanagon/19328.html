Subject: FS: 1600 d.p., tranny, bus goodies

Howdy all!

Here's the latest version of my parts available list.  I've dropped the
price on the engine since I'd *really* like to get rid of it.  I've put
year ranges where applicable (culled from Bus Stop catalog).  Prices, as
usual, are negotiable, and do not include shipping from Cleveland.  Here's
the list:

1600 dual port, bus engine, running and complete, minus one heater box and
muffler.  Email for more details.  $250

out of any gear.  $100

**Package Deal!**  Take both of the above for $300!

Passenger seat from '77, brown upholstry, good condition.  $25

2 bus wheels w/tires, one good (Michelin), $25, one no tread, $10

**The above items cannot be shipped (easily) so you'd have to pick them up
at my place in Cleveland.**
