Subject: No Reverse





Hello all.  I have a friend who's '69 bus won't go into reverse.  Short of
replacing/rebuilding the trans, is there any simple solution(s) that anyone
might have?  The bus does seem to work fine in all forward gears.  This Bus
is also for sale in Carbondale Il.(Southern Il)  Price is not set yet though.

'69 Kamper (Soon I hope)
Oh I do own a chevy as well; just in case of heater malfunctions, well i do
have a 10 below zero sleeping bag too so that I don't have to drive the
chevy that much. :)
