For those of you that have not yet purchased (or inherited) a Bentley
manual for your Vanagon yet (it's THE factory service manual for all
model years of the Vanagon), you can order one from Barnes &amp; Noble off
their web page. My VW dealership wanted $95 for this, B &amp; N charged me
$67.96 plus $7.95 to ship it second day air (less $ if you can wait) and
no tax :-) Check it out. Sorry I don't have the web address, you'll have
to search Yahoo. Once at B &amp; N, search for &quot;Vanagon&quot;. It's the only book
that will come up.
