&lt;&lt; 2) the 1.0 volt drop is a pain, anyone run a new 'power' line to the fuse
 panel or somehow got rid of this drop.  I don't want to just upgrade the
 headlamp wiring with a new feed, what about new feed to entire dash/front
 area??  Ideas? &gt;&gt;
 The voltage drop is caused by the resistance in the harness and the
switches.  Run an extra wire from the alternator to the fuse box.  Use relays
to operate headlights to increase brightness.
