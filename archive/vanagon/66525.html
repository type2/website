&lt;&lt;       I am a new owner of a 88 Westfalia (camper version). I am looking
 for an additional middle to bench to add to my camper when I need to
 transport more people in my van. I know it exist but cannot put my hands
 on the specs in order to know that I am looking for the right stuff. Can
 you help or can you tell me where to find the info (the Wolkswagon
 dealers are not a big help on this one since all they say is that it has
 to be custom made and cost a bundle)
         Can you help? I would appreciate any bit of info you could
 provide me with.
         Merci beaucoup...               Delphine &gt;&gt;


does your westy have the seat tracks in the cargo floor?
middle seats are simple to find...(how many do you want!!)
its the same bench seat as out of a regular 7 pass vanagon.
I have 3 for sale
one grey
one tan
and one blue
