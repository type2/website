&gt;
&gt;Big Basin State Park off Hwy 9 between Santa Cruz and San Jose gets
&gt;my vote.  Big redwoods,  streams, miles of hiking paths, some bike
&gt;trails, waterfall(s), flushing toilets, shower facilities...what more
&gt;could a city slicker want?   :-)  Oh, and I thought the camp fees were
&gt;pretty reasonable too (at least they were a couple years ago).

Big Basin is a good park, but my guess is that it's booked.  It sells out
early for holiday weekends.
