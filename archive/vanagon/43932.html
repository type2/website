Subject: Gas Leak 90 Westfalia

After filling the Van with gas yesterday I noticed gas dripping from beneath
the van on the drivers side.  About one drip every 10 seconds.  The smell of
gas inside the van was strong until we used about 2 - 3 gallons of gas.

I remember discussion about vent lines to the expansion tank(s) leaking?

How do I determine if it is the vent lines or something else?

How difficult is it to replace the vent line, if that's the problem?


TIA

Scott Curtis
