Just wanted to let you all know I pulled the panel off the old
sliding door this afternoon, and found a lot of slack in the cable
running back to the rear latch. Since I was there, I took off
the rear latch, cleaned it up real good, lubed it, put everything
back together (after dropping an e-clip down the crack in the 
driveway and going to the FLAPS to get an English equivalent) and
now the door practically JUMPS open at the slightest touch. Now
I just need to keep it away from those T3's I've been hearing
about where the door opens with no provocation whatsoever!
