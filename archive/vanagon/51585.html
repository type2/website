Subject: Finally got a Westy, Thanks Everyone.

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi all,
     
       Over the past three months I have been trying to buy an '83-'91 
     Westy. After being frustrated with the high priced and low selection 
     in the local Oregon market, I started my search on the Net a month 
     ago.  I asked lots of advice from this list and got lot of good 
     advice.  
       Well, I finally purchased an '85 GL from Washington.  It needs some 
     work, but the price was good and I hope to get lots of good use from 
     this vehicle after I repair some of the mechanical problems.  
       Thanks once again everyone for all the information and advice.  I 
     hope in the not too distant future to be answering more question on 
     this list than generating them.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Vince
     '85 VW GL Westy
     '90 Mit. Eclipse GSX
