Subject:      1995 Eurovan Camper

I've discovered a used 1995 Eurovan Camper on a local lot: it has under
17,000 miles, appears to be perfect mechanically with a nearly perfect
body/interior.  Has stove, sink, refrig., auto windows and mirrors, auto
transmission, cassette stereo, cruise-control, curtains and blinds.

They are asking $27,000.  Is this a good price?  Is this a good year for
the Eurovan Camper?

Thanks
