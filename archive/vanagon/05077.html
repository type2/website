So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I rained cats and dogs the day before yesterday, and when I came home
&gt; from work, I looked at the bus sittin' there in the driveway and thought,
&gt; &quot;hmm, I should pull the tarp down over the windshields a bit better; I 
&gt; _know_ they're gonna be leaking&quot;  So I go to grab the tarp, and it doesn't
&gt; budge.  Hmmm.  I look inside, and the tarp that is s'posd to be covering 
&gt; the bus is in the bus.  You see, I took the sunroof bow out to clean them
&gt; up in prep for the new top, so a pool of water formed in the top where there 
&gt; was no support, and it grew and grew until it almost reached the floor!
&gt; 
&gt; 	The poor little bungee cords that were holding the tarp on were 
&gt; thretched worse than if Roseanne Barr had bungeed off the Golden Gate with 
&gt; them!
&gt; 
&gt; 	So I bailed it all out, cleaned it us best as I could.  I guess I really
&gt; need to put the sunroof back in now...
&gt;

Yeah, that was a pretty good amount of rain for the Sacto. area.  My wife said
that the main street to our house was flooded (La Riviera) and traffic was a
zoo at rush hour.  I decided to go up to the other house and get some work 
done.  No problem later at ~ 8:30pm.  

Hope you didn't get too much water.  MMMmmm mildew.   My favorite smell!  ;)
