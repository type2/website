Subject: Pfeiffer facilities


&gt; I have the Pfeiffer State Park brochure and the writeup in 
&gt; Northern California Camping - I'd be happy to mail copies to
&gt; anyone interested. Actually, here is the text from Northern
&gt; California Camping:
&gt; 
&gt; 	There are 217 campsites for tents or motor homes up to 32 feet
&gt; 	long.  Piped water, picnic tables, and fireplaces are provide.
&gt; 	Rest rooms, showers, a laudromat, groceries, and propane gas
&gt; 	are available.  Campgrounds, rest roomes, the grocery store,
&gt; 	and food services are wheelchar accessible. Pets are permitted.
&gt; 	Call MISTIX at 800-444-PARK ($6.75 MISTIX fee plus $14-$16 per
&gt; 	site). Pets are $1 apiece. Park phone 408-667-2315.
