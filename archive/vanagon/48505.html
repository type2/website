Subject: New waterboxer heads, looking for.

I have an `85 1.9l waterboxer that came standard with cracks between the valve seats.  After I added 
lots of corrosion to the head(s) around the water boot, not to mention gaping holes on the sealing surfaces 
where the little green o-ring keeps the water from aluminum head gasket, I'm ready to replace my  non-corable 
heads! 

I have seen a shiny, brand new, zero miles on it, wasserboxer head that was manufactured by &quot;AMC&quot; ! It looks 
like a high quality casting with superb machining!  But, I can't find a source for them! The one I saw was on an 
engine that came from an unnamed source. The running hardware I have ( valves, springs,.... ) is in good shape. 
 I would just need a freshly machined casting!!!! Two would be really nice! would anyone mind sharing a source 
for new, non-VW heads heads, in particular, &quot;AMC&quot; ?? Dealer is too $$$ for original stock ( sorry VWOA, but I 
was quoted jobber price same as retail, and this was about the most $$ I've seen for a bare head for any car 
I've worked on ).

I have also heard tell of some new Brazilian imports, although the tale goes that the metal is softer, and the 
head itself occasionally mis-places a valve seat or two. Would anyone have any info about the reliability and 
maybe a source for these??

A note regarding my use of Sierra brand Anti Freeze, the stuff that's safe for the environment. When I pulled 
the heads for the third time, I found clear, slightly green tinted, crystalline deposits on the heads, about 
1/8&quot; thick. The deposits were also developing in and around the holes for the coolant passages.  Some of the 
corrosion I found did look a little like electrolysis. Some of the corrosion I found was corrosion -- powdery 
white stuff.  The crystalline stuff was not any kind of corrosion I have ever seen. 60% coolant, 40% water, just 
like the bottle says. Does this happen with any other kinds of coolant, or am I doing something I shouldn't. I 
am thinking a ground strap to #1/#2 head might do anything from nothing, to help fight electrolysis and (?). I'm 
checking into the Coolant FAQ ( and maybe the Betty Ford clinic if the little green deposits don't go away! ).

FYI:  I inspected a 1.9l wasserboxer head, picked off the shelf at SIR in Santa Ana, CA.  Both bridges between 
the seats had been COMPLETELY welded up, the combustion surface area built up and re-machined, the spark plug 
threads were immaculate, the little green o-ring surface was smoooth, it was a REALLY CLEAN head!!! I can only 
speak for the one I saw, and the one looked very professional. 

Albeit, I really, really want a brand new head ( or two,  and just the castings ), and I am stubborn that way, I 
have to question whether or not the re-weld job is a superior structure. My father, a Navy Machinist Mate from 
good ol' WWII, says the rewelded area has superior strength without being brittle, if it is done right in the 
first place ( he does everything himself and is always right, you know! ). He says the welded replacement might 
be better choice because of all the rewelding.
