	(Grin)
	My traditional senseless act of kindness is to pay for the
car behind me at the toll booth... sounds like the electronic
toll charge card thingee was designed specificly to thwart me! 
(If they have one, it'll charge 'em anyway). Oh well, I suppose if the
toll-taker notices, they can carry the $0.25 until someone who needs
it shows up.
