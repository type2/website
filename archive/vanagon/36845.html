The last one that broke on me was in '77 or '78, same Bozobus.  That was
the forward coupling.  Prior to that I didn't even know that they existed.
Back then I was still getting my parts from the dealer and I had a terrible
time finding one - and it was expensive.

So - you've given a good reason not to (price), and I've not broken one in
19 years and around 190,000 miles.  Besides, I've got at least a couple of
them in storage, if I could just find them...

But cleaning and rebuilding them would be the ideal answer - very little
expense and few hassles.

I could always hose-clamp a section of thick-walled reinforced rubber
tubing over the entire coupling - tough, cheap, easy, and pliable enough to
mimic the original...

Thanks for the reply (I haven't even started checking the ads or catalogs yet).
