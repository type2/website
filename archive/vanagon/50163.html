Subject: Shift Rod Boot

The gearshift on my '81 Westy has begun making sqeaking sounds when I
shift. The noise appears to be coming from the area where the long rod
which runs from the gearshift back to the transmission enters the rubber
boot at the transmission. The boot itself is torn. Has anyone ever replaced
that boot on a Vanagon, and if so, any helpful hints? Can the linkages
inside the boot be lubricated, and if so, how and with what lubricant? What
are the implications of not replacing the boot?
Thanks,
Mick
