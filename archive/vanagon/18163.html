Subject: Re: life w/ synthetic tranny fluid

Dan Sez:

&gt;I've had synthetic fluid in the tranny of the '87 now for about a
&gt;month and thought i'd give a report.
&gt;
(SNIP)
&gt;
&gt;The real difference:  Shifting HAS improved (no, really, i mean it).
&gt;Before, after the van fully warmed up i would have to kinda smack the
&gt;gearshift knob to get it out of a gear.  Not real hard, mind you, but
&gt;it was sticky.  Now, it releases from each gear smoothly.  THAT is
&gt;the most noticable change.  No leaks so far (fingers crossed).  Cold
&gt;weather shifting hasn't been put to the test.
&gt;
&gt;Was it worth the hassle and $28 bucks. yes.

What someone needs to do is to replace whatever aged gunk is living in
their tranny (aged gunk? not us on vanagon-L, no, no, no, no, no, no) with
brand spankin' new organic (as oposed to synthetic?) lube and give it the
shiftin' test. Then, drain this and replace with synthetic.

Now at this point, is any difference observed?

Better yet, get a friend of a friend to do the changes so you don't know
what's what (and as a side bonus, they get to squirt lube all over
themselves instead of you).
