Subject: Re: USA number for Eastwood?

&gt;	Folks,
&gt;	Someone was kind enough to send me the Canadian 800 number for
&gt;Eastwood Canada, but I can't use it from California. 800 directory assistance
&gt;didn't have a number for Eastwood that resulted in a car parts and accessories
&gt;place, so I'm stuck. I shouldn't have recycled their catalog!
&gt;	Does anyone out there have the USA 800 number for Eastwood, or
&gt;their regular number for that matter?

Just happend to have the Eastwood catalog sitting here right next to the PC. 
Their number is 1-800-345-1178 or you can fax them at (610)644-0560. When I 
win the lottery, I'll be stocking up my tool inventory from them.
