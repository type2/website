My '93 Ev has exact same symptoms...
Sounds like a VW of A recall is in order -- I'll see if I can follow
this up with VW of A once our move to Pittsburgh is complete...

&gt;&gt;Hi, I have a 93 Eurovan with an intermitent electrical problem. It=20
&gt;&gt;seems that occasionally the fuel level and temperature gauge stop=20
&gt;&gt;responding and then start working again after a while.
&gt;
&gt;Yes!  I'm there right now!...  Although I have yet to get the inaccurate
&gt;reading on the fuel level, I do get the on-or-off syndrome on the temp
&gt;and fuel gauges.  It used to bother me (this has been going on for a week
&gt;or so, now), but I find that I can usually jump start these insolent gauges
&gt;by turning on the turn indicator switch...hey, don't look at me...I didn't
&gt;design this thing, I just drive it...   ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Heh, w/ my luck, the wiring harness in the dash'll ignite and I can
&gt;write in about Balls O' Fire, PtII.....   =3D:-O
