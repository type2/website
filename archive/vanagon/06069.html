Subject: pre-tour warm-up

I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both
thought it might be kind of fun to have a fall or even winter
gathering of west coasters from the list (anyone else who wants
to make the trip, welcome, too, of course!).  We both liked the
idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
of Yosemite.  

I'm thinking of something like maybe a weekend, Friday evening
through Sunday afternoon in a campground in Novemeber, December,
or January. 

Would any of you be interested?
