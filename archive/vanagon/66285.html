Dear Tom,

I am a dedicated 4wd-er and I had a few queries regarding a tour I
wondered you could help me out with:

*Is there an &quot;organized tour&quot; throught he rainforrest/Amazones of South
America?
*Is this tour for professional 4wd-ers or also for the less experienced?
*Is it possible for non-members to participate in a tour like that?
*How large would that group be?
*Is there a touroperator or travel agent in Germany that deals with such
tours?
*Can you tell me something about the estimated costs?

I hope you find the time to answer these question for me. I anyway want
to thank you for your effort. Could you please send your reply to this
e-mail address?

Best regards,
