Subject: Re: 92 Eurovan transmissions

&gt; Interesting suggestion.  I just called the dealer to check on progress (and
&gt; to make sure they had actually STARTED on the car, which isn't always a
&gt; valid assumption for one to make, JUST because you filled out the paperwork
&gt; and left the car and key!).

Benn there before...

&gt; Wouldn't start for them either.  No spark and no fuel pressure and they
&gt; don't yet know why.  Damn, if this turns out to be in the ecu, I'm probably
&gt; hosed to the tune of lots of money, since that's not covered by the
&gt; warranty beyond 24K miles (has about 33K now).  I'm gonna be bummed.

Not much I can do to help there.

&gt; On the other hand, the major problem I had last year was due to a battery
&gt; having sat in the car on the lot for up to two years (manufacture date was
&gt; 2yrs and 1month before I bought it).  I imagine that battery connections
&gt; could have a big effect on computer voltage, which would make or break
&gt; whether it ran or not.  Like the FI in the ol' squarebacks we had.  If the
&gt; battery wasn't up to snuff, all the juice went into cranking, and not
&gt; enough to squirting fuel and firing plugs, and it wouldn't run.  Hope
&gt; THAT's it.

Pretty much along the lines I was thinking.  Our battery was replaced 
early on by the dealer since our van too had been sitting around from 93 
to almost 95 before we got it.
