Subject: Hot Rod gathering in Round Rock, Tx

All,

Saturday I went to the weekly gathering of hot rods, in Round Rock(just
before the McNeil road exit, for those interested), among the camaros,
Bel Aires, and Corvettes, I saw 4 beetles. I don't know much about id'ing
them from year to year, but 3 of the four were stock(looking at least),
one was a mid '60s vert, with 13,000 mi on the clock, and what I believe
to be factory a/c(didn't know they put that on 'verts), and the interior
was in pretty good shape(it was kind of dark) the other two were '70s
vintage, and look alright. The last was a custom that I had seen before
driving around No. Austin. It has those old style Ford teardrop tail-
lights, which I personally do not go for, but other than that I kinda
liked it.  I drove my Thing, which garnered a few &quot;whut in tarnation is
thaaat?&quot; or something similar. Maybe next week I'll go again, and park it
next to some of these bugs, just for the hell of it.
As a side attraction to the hole thing, Big Daddy Don Garlitis'(sp?)
dragster was on display, along with the truck &amp; trailer used to haul it.
there was a table with t-shirts, keychains and such for sale. All in all
not a bad evening if you like looking at old, and older hot rods.
