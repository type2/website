&gt;Because we're about to spend a month in the camper I've done a few other things
&gt;to make it more comfortable/convienent. I pulled the front plastic piece 
off the dash
&gt;that is right in front of the stick (covers heating vents and hoses) and 
mounted
&gt;two cupholders, a CB (with weather band) and the refrigerator temp remote 
display.
&gt;We put seat back stuff holders on the back of both front seats (from 
Autoshade). 
&gt;I built an awning with two wood dowels, a joiner, an 8x10 tarp, two spring 
clamps and two
&gt;telescoping legs (from REI). I wrap the dowels in one end of the tarp and 
put it
&gt;in the rain gutter and then secure at both ends with the spring clamps. The 
other
&gt;end is held up with the legs and rope with tent stakes. Works great for shade.
&gt;Tinted the windows to reduce greenhouse effect (we're going to the 
SouthWest) and
&gt;put one of those Fresnel lenses in the back window so I don't customize the
&gt;rear bumper backing up.
&gt;
&gt;Just got 4 new Michelin MXL 205/70 14's (reinforced) to handle the extra 
load. They
&gt;were $83 (not including mounting and balancing) at Western Auto.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this wasn't too boring :)

Not too boring at all.  It gave me some great ideas to &quot;customize&quot; my 79 bus 
I'm in the process of putting on the road.  Should hear from the inspection 
shop today!
