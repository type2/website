Subject: RE: Later breadloafs with Type I engine

Dave Kautz inquires about putting a Type 1 engine where the Type 4 belongs.
You have to value your time real low, Dave, to make this conversion price
out right.  You'll need to fabricate a big apron to seal above-engine from
below-engine, along with the custom rear support member and tricky sheet
metal in the front corners.  It's usually cheaper to make the original 
stuff work right, rather than to get something wierd to work adequately.

Speaking of something wierd, did anyone else see the article about the &quot;car&quot;
that was Scirroco (I think) in front and VW van in back.  Two engines, which
can run together or separately.  Talk about something useful to have in a
camping emergency: &quot;Luckily my other engine was still ok.&quot;
