Subject: Re: loose wipers

&gt;
&gt;I had a similar problem with my 86 GTI, I got a couple of thin washers
&gt;and a 1&quot; section of copper wire (18 ga). I removed the wiper arm, then
&gt;stripped off the insullation from the wire. Next I spread the wire
&gt;along 1/2 of the hole inside the wiper arm. I then put the arm back on
How exactly?  Co-axially with the shaft, or wrapped around the shaft?

&gt;the wiper shaft, placed a couple of thin washers on top of the arm
Why the washers?
&gt;and tightened the whole thing down.
&gt;
&gt;It worked for two years (through snow, rain and rallies) until I decided
&gt;to break down and get new wiper shafts and arms.
