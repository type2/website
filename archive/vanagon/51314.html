Chris;
I bought my 86 in 1989.For the first three years, it always barely passed
HC tests. I replaced the catalytic converter after it self destructed and
a week later the HC test was about 12ppm! I do not remember the exact
numbers but it was an astonishing improvement.
Our 85 has not had a reoccurrence of its hard start problem since I
cleaned and oiled the timing advance mechanism in the distributor. My
theory was that it was getting stuck too far advanced to start. I too
had to hold the throttle wide open and keep turning it over till it
would attempt to fire. I believe that the throttle, being wide open, 
reduced the vacuum to the distributor and provided some timing retard.
Good Luck

&gt;Hello One &amp; All;
&gt;
&gt;I am trying to get my 82 Vanagon (non-California version) through the 
&gt;smog
&gt;emissions inspection in California. Preliminary results indicate that
&gt;at idle, the hydrocarbon (HC) emission levels are 4 times that 
&gt;allowable 
&gt;by CA law (250 ppm HC). At 2500 rpm, the HC emissions are reduced to
&gt;borderline passing (250-300 ppm). Prior to this initial inspection. I 
&gt;did
&gt;a complete tune-up; new plugs (Cu), points, rotor, dist cap, plug 
&gt;wires
&gt;.. dynamic timing _at_ 900 rpm, and even spiked my gasoline with a nice 
&gt;dose
&gt;of methanol The methanol addition resulted in reduced emissions (1200 
&gt;ppm
&gt;to 1000), but clearly not enough to pass.
&gt;
&gt;The Vanagon has the orignal 2.0 L, fuel-inj, air-cooled engine
&gt;that I rebuilt 13,000 miles ago (Summer 1994). Total miles on the
&gt;engine, including rebuild miles, is about 80,000. The rebuild included
&gt;remanufactured heads, oil pump, cam, pistons, main bearings, 
&gt;cylinders,
&gt;rods, hyd lifters, (practically everything in the block), oil cooler,
&gt;coil, rebuilt dist, etc. The exhaust system is a non-California 
&gt;system.
&gt;During the rebuild the EGR filter device (completely rusted out) was
&gt;removed, and the attachment point to the cross-over pipe was welded 
&gt;shut. I
&gt;currently get about 18-19 mpg with this vehicle and it runs like a 
&gt;charm. 
&gt;Only problem I've encountered, prior to and after the rebuild, is that 
&gt;the
&gt;vehicle sometimes is very slugish re-starting after it's been started,
&gt;driven a few minutes, then turned off. This is a sporadic occurrence
&gt;(usually circumvented by pumping the accelerator a couple of times 
&gt;prior 
&gt;to turningover the engine). I usually fill-up with 87 Octane gasoline 
&gt;(major
&gt;brands), and have been using 10W40 Oil (Pennzoil).
&gt;
&gt;I can replace the EGR filter unit and repair the connection, at
&gt;considerable expense, but am unconvinced that returning the exhaust 
&gt;system
&gt;to it's original condition alone will reduce the HC emissions enough 
&gt;to
&gt;pass the smog inspection. Based upon my description of the vehicle 
&gt;above,
&gt;could anyone suggest a reason (or fix) why the HC emissions are so 
&gt;high.
&gt;If I'm paying attention, I can actually smell unburnt gasoline 
&gt;discharging
&gt;from the tail pipe (but it's not overpowering).
&gt;
&gt;Based upon California's stringent smog inspection rules, I need to 
&gt;reduce
&gt;the HC emmisions or the vehicle is not driveable in CA. My options at 
&gt;this
&gt;point are to fix the problem (if it's possible), sell the vehicle in
&gt;another state, or convert it into an expensive coffee table.
&gt;
&gt;Since I would really like to keep this work horse vehicle,
&gt;I would greatly appreciate any help, hints, suggestions, etc., on
&gt;repairs, adjustments I can make to reduce the high HC emissions.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Chris
