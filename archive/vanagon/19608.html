Subject: cooler up front/in back?
Date: Sat, 24 Jun 1995 05:32:00 GMT


I'm going to install an extra oil cooler on my Type IV 73 Westy. 
I've had people tell me that they would install it &quot;up front&quot; on the front 
beam. But to do this will require a lot of jazz I don't have. I will have to
buy a roll of copper tubing and braze fittings on it.

I've also been told that I can install it over the tranny, as is done in
my 71 Super Beetle. (I didn't do it, i bought it this way.)

So, for all the big time extra hassle, is it worth it? Should I spend the 
extra time and money to put the cooler up on the beam? The people who say this
say that the &quot;road heat&quot; in really hot weather wipes out the advantage.

Is this true?

Thanks in advance.
