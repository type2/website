     &gt; Yep, 80's VW products had something Blue that looked like an LED
     &gt; for high-beams. I always intended to get a 'spare' and see what it
     was-
     &gt; my guess is a lightbulb with a blue plastic cover. If its an LED,

     Yes, it is definitely incadescent. I seem to recall some electronics
     course that mentioned that there was no way to get blue colored light
     from an LED due to wavelength, frequency, blah, blah.....

     When my blue hi-beam indicator went on on the Vanagon, I went to the
     dealer to get a new one. They were asking approx $12, and needed to
     special order it.

     I went to Radio Shack, and got a LED with an internal resistor (to
     drop the 12v down to ~1v). Installed just fine...total cost:$.99

     Of course, now my hi-beam indicator is red...doesn't bother me!
