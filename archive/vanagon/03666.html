Subject: HELP!

Howdy.

I hate be real stinker, seeing that I don't receive these postings anymore
(couldn't keep up with all the day to day &quot;traffic&quot;) but you know I wouldn't
be asking if I didn't REALLY NEED HELP!

You see, I'm supposed to be moving back to LA from NY in a little over a
month and I'm taking Mein 1970 Kamper. That's the good part. Now I'm building
this godforsaken DIY trailer made from matchsticks to tow my motorcycle with
me (as a parts fetcher) but I can't seem to find anyone with a suitable TOW
HITCH. Seems like the last company that made them stopped about ten years ago
and no one else has tried because of &quot;liability&quot; problems? I say gimmeabreak!

Does _anyone_ out there know where I could find a suitable tow hitch (Class
1) so I don't have to go out and fabricate one myself?

I would be so grateful, I might just stop by on my way across and buy you a
few beers!

Please to be emailing me at  yeebot_at_aol_dot_com  because I no receive digest
anymore (at least til I get a comany acct!)

Thanks for all,
Mike
