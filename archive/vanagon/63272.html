Subject: Break Fluid

According to the VW owners manual, the vanagon uses DOT 4 break fluid.
 However, I seem to only find DOT3 and some places I have taken my &quot;Baby
Blue Whale&quot; to tend look at me crazy when I mention DOT4.
 -What are the effects of using DOT3 instead of DOT4?
 -What is the boiling point of both liquids?
 -I saw at a local Western Auto a new DOT3 fluid by Prestone.  It claims
to have a higher boiling point than regular DOT3.  Can this be an
acceptable substitution?

I'll contact my local VW and hear what they got to say.

Thanks,
