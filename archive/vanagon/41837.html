Subject: torque, rear brakes


&gt;390 foot-lb of torque is 390 lb with a 1 foot lever OR
&gt;1lb with a 390 foot lever...

Now *that* is a cheater...

&gt;So I measure 1.64 feet on my breaker bar
&gt;and make a mark on the bar and stand with one foot on each side
&gt;of the bar, and equalize my wieght.

Is this right? I've wondered this before. Chiefly because the instructions
to my torque wrench are awfully ticky about having the handle swivel on
that little fulcrum in there while I'm sweating and grunting. No pulling on
the bottom of the handle for an extra two inches of leverage! It's hard
sometimes...

So we want to stand on it, okay. But whatever we put inboard of the
line--the foot-pound line above--is going to be &quot;lighter&quot; than what we put
outboard. Less leverage. How do we calculate how much of the mass to put
outboard? Probably at 390 feet it doesn't matter, but I bet at 4 feet it
does. Maybe Brother Maher knows, he can do math...
