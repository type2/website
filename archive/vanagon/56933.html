Subject: more on Pinnacles


More info (thanks to several on the list for sending in bits of
info on this.  I've compliled and quoted shamelessly without 
bothering to give any of you credit):

Before I forget, I'll be sending out a separate e-mail soon
regarding food/potluck, etc.  Also suggestions for things
to bring/burn, etc.  For now, start collecting firewood -
lots.  Bottle your homebrew, and start making lots of ice.

Our camping trip (sorry to keep repeating, but we keep
getting more new people) is March 21-24 at Pinnacles, about 2
hours south of San Jose.  

For those of you just tuning in, the night of SUNDAY, March 23,
there is this partial eclipse of the moon covering 90% of the 
surface. 9 p.m., PDT.  Not enough for you?  There's 
more:  on that same night, the Hale-Bopp comet will be approaching 
its closest position  to Earth. If all predictions are correct, 
this is slated to be the most stunning celestial event of the 
century. The comet is supposed to be made even more brilliant as the 
night sky darkens along with the Moon.  This all takes place 
Sunday nite/Monday morning, like maybe around 3-5 a.m., so you 
may want to plan to get sick for work now.  For some of you,
this means getting up early, for others, going to bed late.
It goes without saying that you should bring binnoculars,
or better, a telescope, whichJI believe at least one of our
members plans to take along.

Obviously the above is why we've voted to go toJPinnacles,
since we were determined to have a space on a high ridge away
from electric light and air-pollution of cities.  Geologically 
speaking, Pinnicles in northern CA started out as one volcano
near LA, sitting on the San Andreas Fault line.  What one sees 
near Soledad is the part of the volcano which drifted almost 
400 miles along the fault millions of years ago.  Amazing!

For more info on the eclipse, check the following URL:
http://planets.gsfc.nasa_dot_gov/eclipse/TSE97Comet.html

The Hale-Bopp comet appears in the ENE + SSW about 20 degrees 
above the horizon. Best viewing time is supposed to be
4-5 a.m., but possibly will be viewable earlier, as I
understand it.

There's 2 numbers for Pinnacles for your reference:
408.389.4462 and 408.389.4485.  The campground is just outside 
the east side of the park and DOESJHAVE showers and toilets.  If
past parks are an indication, we may need to bring coins
to operate them - be forewarned.  They have room for 22
vehicles plus overflow.  

Remember especially that we need your head count (if I haven't
already heard from you), and that we all need to reimburse
poor Ron, who has made a significant deposit of faith and
$$s in our all showing up if we say we are going to!  

Also REMEMBER:  the reservations Ron has made for us are for Friday
and Saturday evenings, not for Sunday (when the big gazing
event takes place).
