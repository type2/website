Subject:      Re: clutch pedal problems on my '86

  I hate to be the giver of bad news, but the only way to get to the
  clutch pedal mechanics is by removing the dash. I suspect that the
  fork to the hydraulic cylinder is bad. I have seen a few of them
  with big slots worn in them. While your in the dash, replace
  the heater fan motor!

&gt; The hydraulics are okay and the clutch itself is working fine, but the

&gt; With the frame member in the way, I can't even see what the problem might be.
&gt; Anyone ever had this assembly apart?  How to remove?
