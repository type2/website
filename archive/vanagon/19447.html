&gt;Back in 75 or was it 76 after I had my '56 beetle painted, I was
&gt;at the Univ's library working on a project for my MBA...as I was
&gt;walking out to the parking lot a large Cadillac pulled into the
&gt;space next to mine...the door opened and I heard &quot;THUNK&quot;...

&gt;I calmly walked up to my bug, and there was a nice door ding
&gt;in the nice, fresh paint. I looked at the Afro-american passenger
&gt;and made some comment about being a bit more careful...and
&gt;he responded...&quot;Hey Brutha, its only a Vokswagin'...&quot;

I can't imagine what the man's race has to do with it. In those days of
extremely wide doors there were countless people of all races, religions
and professions (even lawyers) who were quite content to ding your car
because of the extra effort it might cost them to open their door
carefully. In addition there was a very cavalier attitude to cars in
general, as they quickly rusted and wore out. Recall the practice of
(parallel) parking by ear.

I agree that the man's behavior was unconscionable, but, again, I don't
think race has anything to do with it. Nor should it be reported by the
narrator.

My two cents (Cdn) worth.
