Subject: Re: Question re: engine removal

&gt;I am about to pull the 1700 engine from my 73 so I can overhaul it (inside)
&gt;over the winter.
&gt;
&gt;Can someone confirm for me that it is NOT necessary to support the
&gt;transaxle with the engine pulled?
&gt;
&gt;NOPE.... support it, use a scissor jack, wood blocks etc. Otherwise as you 
pull the engine backwards the input shaft ends up supporting the tranny 
briefly until it separates completely. Use a jack, not just blocks, because 
you can play with the vertical position slightly which aids aligning things 
on the way back-in. I've never done the work without a support of some kind, 
get some other opinions also, as I may just be a wuss in Email clothing.
