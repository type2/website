Hi All,

While on vacation in New Brunswick a few weeks ago I had the great 
pleasure of driving one of my old buses again--a 1961 Deluxe 
sunroofless Microbus. The place we were at (Grand Manan, a beautiful 
place) somewhat surprisingly had something I having seen in a long time, 
open dumps.  About the only great benefit of having an open dump is that 
it's possible to go to the dump empty and leave with all kinds of great 
free stuff!!  So was the case as my toddler and I  went dump touring with 
Captain James, owner of a magnificent 50' schooner he built himself.  The 
Captain called these dump tours 'Coon Hunting'.  Anyways, we scored a 
great variety of desirable items, a 3&quot; x 5&quot; lengthy piece of Teak wood, a 
huge cast iron sink in very good condition, great lengths of heavy duty 
cable (to be used as cheap re-bar), and a very solid looking door.  All 
these items were stuffed into the bus (the middle and rear seats were long 
removed) and we motored back home.  

It's always been an enjoyable challenge to me to see how much stuff I can 
stuff into my split window buses.  I been doing it for over a decade, so 
I've sort of developed a 'system' for the bus stuffing,  One must start 
by having all items sorted by size and sometimes shape and going from the 
'big' stuff on down to the more negotiable items.

Memorable hauls from the past:

Full sized washer &amp; dryers (the cargo doors were bungied together)
5 large full kegs of beer and 4 'riders' in a 40hp rusty Westy 
          (they can bottom out!) 
A large fiberglass shower
Numerous tonages of VW parts

Any interesting additions from you Vanagon listers?  Come forth lurkers!!
