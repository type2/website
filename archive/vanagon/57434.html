Subject: Help With Instrument Lighting Please

     Hi All,
     
     My digital clock between the speedometer and odometer is no longer 
     backlit when I have my headlights on. Does anyone has any experience 
     fixing this?
     
     In addition, the station preset lights on my VW Design am/fm/cassette 
     radio also no longer light up when the headlights are on. I originally 
     thought the LED's were bad, but another VW Design radio did the same 
     thing.
     
     Are these two situations related? Any help would be appreciated.
     
     TIA,
