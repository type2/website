&gt;Hi and thanks for all the responses to the skylight question. Now I'm 
&gt;wondering about the gas mileage I'm getting on my 85 Westy. The 
&gt;seller said about 20-22 is this realistic? The needle seems to be 
&gt;dropping fairly quickly...is there anything I can do to improve 
&gt;mileage? I am using 93 octane. Also I'm having to replace the power

I have had a 85 GL for the past 9 years. I get about 16 miles/gal city
and 22-25 miles/gal highway. I have used 87-93 octane gas and the mpg
stays about the same although the van runs with less problems on the
93.
