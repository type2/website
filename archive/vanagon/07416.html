Subject: RE: New members starting Problem

My '81 had the same/similar problem - after about 5-10 miles
of driving it would chug or if I stopped it wouldn't start
until after about 45 minutes of cooling down.  Took it to my
mechanic and he replaced some sort of 'heat sensing bolt' (anyone
know what exactly this is?) and it's ran fine since.
