Subject: Re: westy H2O-tank key?

&gt; 
&gt; I have an '81 westy with no key to the water tank.  Does anyone
&gt; know if these keys are all the same or where I can get one?  I've
&gt; tried 3 dealers with no success.  If they ARE the same, is
&gt; anyone willing to make me a copy?
&gt; 
&gt; 

Well the keys are pretty simple, I think that you could easily fashion
one out of a 1/8&quot; piece of plastic or steel.  Grab the next person 
climbing into their Westy and ask them if you could make a quick 
copy from theirs by outlining around the key on a piece of paper.
Take the paper home and fashion one from the above materials (or from
some over cooked cookie dough ;) ) and it should work fine.
