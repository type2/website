Volkswagen Vanagon - A delightful combination of van and wagon for the
                     Eighties
Road &amp; Track, July 1980

Quarter-billion-dollar spending programs are not all that unusual in the
automobile industry, but the fact that Volkswagen spend more than that
on the Vanagon might strike some observers as curious.  However, VW is
not a company given to flights of fancy in dealing with money, and the
tremendous investment in producing the latest Transporter (the official
factory name) is considered well spent.  While the American market will
have only two versions, the Vanagon (in 7- and 9-seat models as well as
the bare-interior Kombi) and Vanagon Camper, Europe and other markets
have a wide variety of models including commercial configurations, a
high-bed pickup, a double-cab pickup, etc.

Speculation was rampant that this third version of the VW van (the model
was introduced in 1949 and a major revision followed in 1967) would be
totally different from its predecessors and could be powered by a water-
cooled version of the VW Rabbit inline 4-cylinder engine.  But, while VW
says the Vanagon is new from the ground up, the drivetrain is a
carryover and represents the last bastion of VWs built in the homeland
with air-cooled, pancake engines.

VW's primary goal in designing the Vanagon was to offer the best
features of a van and station wagon in a single vehicle.  With that set
of parameters in mind, an in-depth study of drivetrain configurations
was undertaken.  As reported in &quot;Transporter Tradition Triumphs,&quot; R&amp;T,
September 1979, 12 possible drivetrain configurations were considered
before the decision was made to continue with the traditional rear-
engine/rear-drive layout.  The engine, then, is the same 1970-cc
overhead-valve flat-4 as before with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection.
It develops 67 bhp (SAE net) at 4200 rpm and 101 lb-ft torque at 3000,
which propels the Vanagon along in reasonable fashion considering its
roughly 3500-lb test weight: 0 - 60 mph in 21.2 seconds; the quarter-
mile run covered in 21.5 sec at a speed of 60.5 mph.  Clearly, this is
not acceleration that will elicit gasps of glee, but it does permit the
Vanagon to keep up with everyday, around-town traffic.  The engine's
driveability is exemplary; it starts immediately whether hot or cold
and runs smoothly without surging or stumbling.  A word of caution needs
to be added with regard to fueling the Vanagon.  Behind the rear license
plate frame is a capped oil filler tube, and one of our editors
discovered an inattentive attendant pumping gasoline into it!  An
extensive crankcase flushing put things right, but Vanagon drivers,
beware: Careless attendants may miss the fuel filler near the right
front door and zero in at the rear.  The point, by the way, of the
license plate hatch is to allow oil-level checks without having to
remove the engine access hatch, part of the cargo floor.

The 4-speed transaxle is located a considerable distance away from the
shift lever, but VW has many years' experience with long-distance
linkage and most staffers rated the shifting characteristics of the
Vanagon quite good -- one, however, found selecting 1st and occassional
contest of wills when making quick gear changes at stoplights.  The
transmission's ratios seem to fall into two distinct categories, with
1st and 2nd designed for acceleration, a large gap between 2nd and 3rd,
and the top two ratios made for cruising -- especially 4th which is an
overdrive ratio of 0.88:1.  The final drive ratio is a rather low one
-- 4.57:1 -- which further aids acceleration.  There is an optional
3-speed automatic transmission too, and with it the final drive ratio
is 4.09:1.

What's different about the Vanagon, though, is the new body, and the
cleaner, crisper styling results in a better looking van.  Some may find
the Vanagon doesn't have the charm of the older VW bus design, but the
familial resemblance is there and along with it are a number of
improvements.  Starting at the front, the shape is more aerodynamically
efficient despite its angular appearance, and VW claims a drag
coefficient of 0.44 (Remember, though, drag is a function of this
coefficient TIMES frontal area.)  The windshield is 21 percent larger
than that of the previous Transporter and there is a 22-percent increase
in side window glass area -- the larger greenhouse results in excellent
outward vision in all directions.  The space between the front seats
leading to the passenger area in the rear is 15 percent larger, as is
the sliding side door (which Volkswagen was the first to use on vans,
by the way).  Moving rearward, the luggage compartment's 36.6-cu-ft
volume over the engine box is 40 percent larger than previously because
the compartment's floor has been lowered 7.9 in. The rear hatch is 75
percent larger than before and the rear window is 50 percent greater in
size, affording considerably improved rear vision.

Outside, the Vanagon is not much different in size from its predecessor
except it's 3.3 in. wider.  The track has also grown 6.9 in. in front
and 4.5 in. at the rear, so both ends now measure 61.8 in., and the
wheelbase is 2.4 in. longer than before.  The wider track and increased
wheelbase are designed to give the Vanagon greater stability than its
predecessors, as well as help reduce susceptibility to crosswinds by
moving the center of gravity ahead of the body's center of pressure.
Obviously, the Vanagon's slab sides make it subject to side-wind
buffeting and one staff member experienced this firsthand on a rainy
night with wind gusts running 25-50 knots.  As expected, the Vanagon
was a handful, but so were all the other vans he observed as they
danced along the freeway.  Nonetheless, VW has greatly improved the
Vanagon in this area compared to previous Transporters.

The Vanagon features completey new front suspension using unequal-length
A-arms, variable-rate coil springs, tube shocks and an anti-roll bar in
place of the previous trailing arms and torsion bars.  The rear
suspension no longer features torsion bars, but now uses progressive-
rate coil springs with semi-trailing arms and tube shocks.  The all-
independent suspension provides handling characteristics that are better
than one might expect when looking at this box on wheels.  There is a
goodly amount of body roll during hard cornering, but the wider track
provides a sure-footedness on winding roads that is perfectly
respectable. Even at relatively high speeds - 80-plus mph - the Vanagon
is very stable and the rack-and-pinion steering is quite precise and
provides the driver with a good feel for what the front wheels are
doing.  Even without power-assist, the steering effort is never too
heavy and low-speed maneuvering is not a muscle-flexing chore.

Volkswagen's chassis engineers have achieved a pleasant balance between
the ride and handling characteristics.  There is compliance and abundant
wheel travel, resulting in a ride that is firm, controlled and yet still
comfortable, without the jarring aspects common to U.S. vans with solid
rear axles.  Dips and rough stretches of pavement are not cause for
alarm and the Vanagon acquits itself very well indeed when the going
gets tough.

One of the characteristics of driving a van that can be somewhat
unsettling to the novice is that you sit quite high.  While that's great
for observing what's taking place around you, it can be a bit
disconcerting in hard cornering or heavy braking situations.  No cause
to worry in the VW, however, as we found the control excellent in our
simulated panic stops from 60 mph.  The brakes were easily modulated to
maintain maximum effectiveness and there was virtually no tendency for
either front or rear brakes to lock during this test.  The distance,
165 ft, was very good, and the amount of fade in our six stops from 60
mph was not excessive, with pedal pressure going from 28 lb to 38 by
the sixth stop.  The pedal pressure was nearing the limit of effective-
ness by that point, however.  Thus the Vanagon didn't earn an
&quot;excellent&quot; overall brake rating, but it does merit a &quot;very good.&quot;
Unfortunately, the Vanagon's leisurely rate of acceleration above 60 mph
prevented us from doing our panic-stop test from 80 mph because of lack
of straightaway at the test track.

In keeping with Volkswagen's stated purpose of offering a combination of
van and station wagon in the Vanagon, the interior design, finish and
accommodation blend in a pleasing mixture of van and car.  Several staff
members commented that driving the Vanagon was similar to being at the
wheel of a Rabbit, and that this latest Transporter is more like a car
than a bus.  The interior is nicely finished with only an occasional
sign of cost-saving in materials.  There is carpeting that has a nice
look and helps with sound deadening, but in our test model it was not
fastened down securely in a couple of spots.  The vinyl used for seat
covering and door panels, as well as other surfaces, seems to be of high
quality, has a nice appearance and should hold up well based on previous
experience with VW vans and cars.  There are a number of small touches
to the Vanagon interior that we appreciate, such as the five passenger-
assist handles at strategic locations for ingress/egress, a deep, usable
glovebox, map pockets in the front doors, day/night mirror and vent
windows up front.  The individual front seats have a 25-percent greater
range of adjustment, according to VW, and can be adjusted for seatback
angle.  The rear bench seats are comfortable and in our particular test
model will accommodate five passengers in luxury.  Another seating
layout accommodates nine people, while the Kombi version has two front
seats and a relatively sparse cargo area which the buyer can arrange to
his liking; the Westfalia-Werke Camper model is fitted with a
convertible sofa bed, table, cabinets and a pantry, while the deluxe
camper has a refrigerator and a 2-burner stove.

In addition to the greater cargo space behind the rear seat, the new
Vanagon's interior roominess has been enhanced by a combination of
lowering the floor and more spare roof design, with the result that the
entire interior seems cavernous and airy.  Also, the middle bench seat
can be removed and the rear one folded down to add another 72.3 cu ft
of cargo volume (by our measurement technique which still leaves
adequate rear vision once packed).  For walking around room, ferrying
all the kids in the neighborhood to the playground or setting up a
commuter carpool, the Vanagon is the ideal choice.

We had quite a mystery for a short spell when it came to the ventilation
system -- it turns out that a 3-speed fan for boosting airflow is
optional, which seems downright stingy in a nearly $10,000 vehicle.  Our
test model didn't have the fan, so heat is distributed by heat
exchangers and engine revs only.  Fresh air ventilation is effective
through well placed dash outlets but they don't carry heated air.  And
there is virtually no air movement, fresh or heated, when the Vanagon
is staionary.

Nearly all of our drivers praised the Vanagon's driving position and
control layout, although one commented that he would like the shift
lever bent back toward the driver a little more.  Sitting up so high
combined with the increase window glass area gives the driver a
marvelous panoramic view.  The driver doesn't sit quite as close to the
absolute front limit of the van as with previous models, because more
than 3.0 in. have been added ahead of the front wheels along with a
larger bumper for greater crash protection.  The noise level is quite
low for a van, aided by the rear location of the engine and the
excellent job of sealing around doors and windows.

All in all, the Vanagon is a major improvement over its predecessors
and, in our opinion, maintains VW's position as the manufacturer of the
world's leading van.  During the period when we were testing the
Vanagon, we also had occasion to drive several U.S.-built vans and we
found them lacking in the level of sophistication that distinguishes the
Vanagon.  Admittedly, the domestic vans do have a price advantage of
roughly $1000-$2000 when equipped in a similar fashion, but direct
comparison is impossible because of the major design differences.  The
VW's independent suspension, effective use of space, quality of fit and
finish -- even something that seems as simple as the sliding side door,
which works so smoothly on the VW and is so ponderous on the domestics
-- are features that have endeared VW van owners to this box on wheels
for years.  The Vanagon version, while it may take some getting used to
and perhaps lack some of the charm of the older, softer, more rounded
design, is a vehicle with the attributes of its predecessors and
innovations of the future.  While its level of acceleration may deter
those who seek more abundant horsepower, and its fuel efficiency is no
longer head and shoulders above the domestics (thanks to reduced
engine displacements and fuel-economy-designed gear ratio combinations
in American vans), the Volkswagen Vanagon represents the state of the
art in van design and execution.  And, perhaps more importantly, sets
the standard for multi-purpose vehicles that are sure to come in the
years ahead.  There seems to be little doubt that current domestic van
configurations are going to be changing, and that several Japanese
manufacturers are considering small-scale utility vehicles that can
carry five or more passengers and luggage.  The VW van, as it has been
since its inception, is clearly the leader in technological development
in its class.

Extended-Use Report: VW Vanagon at 12,000 miles
                     Terrific utility, but is it reliable?
Road &amp; Track, April 1983

It's been our custom to maintain at least two, and perhaps three, cars
in our extended-use vehicle collection.  Currently, that means our
beloved 1979 Mazda RX-7 and a spirited 1982 Alfa Romeo GTV 6/2.5.  Both
are terrific fun and in constant demand, but we wanted something
practical for balance.  One staffer seems to enjoy hauling an amateur
hockey team around and the less sporting among us are called upon to
help move various objects such as a pump organ, a Lotus 7 frame, an art
exhibit and the occasional Benjamin ficus.  And some of us enjoy getting
together with as many family members as possible and going on jaunts:
This might include spending a day at the Huntington Library, or loading
everyone up and batting up to Oregon.  In Volkswagen's modern,
functional Vanagon there looked to be our best choice for a new member
of the team.  When we took delivery of our blue GL in May 1982, we
wondered if it would prove economical, reliable and fun to drive as the
miles accumulated -- 12,000 as of now.

First, economy.  Using our calculations of cost per mile as a definition
of the term, economy begins with the base price.  In our case, we
actually lease the vehicle, but had it been purchased as received, the
bill would have read $11,360 (sans delivery charges and taxes, which
can vary regionally).  Our only options were an AM/VM stereo/cassette
unit ($325) and the elaborate overhead air conditioning system ($1125).
Next, we must consider our Vanagon's current resale value and the KELLY
BLUE BOOK pegs that at $10,125 (conservatively).  The difference is a
depreciation of $2685.

Under fuel consumption, we can report our somewhat heavy-footed driving
manners have caused our Vanagon to deliver 18.5 mpg on average, quite
good considering its barnlike frontal area and 3290-lb curb weight.
Compared with our original Vanagon road test results (July 1980), the
present long-term testing has yielded a 2.0-mpg improvement.  It might
be that this engine is benefiting from being fully broken-in; anyway,
the total fuel bill comes to $942.

And as for maintenance, Volkswagen's specified schedule for the test
period has meant two checkups: the first being on-the-house at 1000
miles; the second, a routine 7500-mile service that cost us a
reasonable $35.13.  The total for depreciation, fuel and maintenance
costs (omitting insurance) comes to $3662.13, which means an average
operating cost of 30.5 cents/mile for these first 12,000 miles.  This
is a very high figure, three times that of the Mazda RX-7, for example
(see 48,000-mile report, R&amp;T, December 1982).  But don't be fooled by
the comparison.

The Vanagon is actually a mini-bus, after all.  With seven roomy seats
in our GL version, the interior's utility quotient is enormous.  Indeed,
if you have reason to haul several people around regularly, the cost per
mile analysis is deceptive.  And also notice that a major culprit in the
cost equation is the sizable early rate of new car depreciation --
which, of course, is not exclusive to Vanagons.

Reliability:  Early on, there were a few teething problems:  The a/c
lost its Freon charge, and later one of the unit's pulleys worked
loose.  These are not uncommon occurances and both were quickly fixed
under warranty.  However, soo a rash of quirky electrical troubles
broke out.  First, a simple electrical connector came loose, and because
it is the ground for both the fuel pump and fuel management computer,
this mishap stranded van and driver until the elusive connector was
discovered.  Next, it refused to start at a high altitude where a tow
truck was needed to restore the Vanagon and people to lower ground and
where the bus started readily the next morning;  no one seemed to know
why.  Further, on the same trip, the driver's side window winder broke
as did a clip that holds a windshield visor -- small, but irritating
problems.

The third air conditioner-related malfunction came at about the 10,000-
mile point when the unit threw its belt while out on the road.  And five
days later, it was the electrical systems' turn again, this time
completely shutting down while crossing a California desert.  This
entailed a 48-mile tow to the nearest Volkswagen dealer, where
strangely the system (again) sprang back to health unaided, no trace of
the ailment detectable to the mystified mechanics.  Clearly, the earlier
electrical troubles had not been left at high elevations.  Trying to
limp home, the Vanagon did 85 miles before stopping once more and,
again in tow, it was off this time to a different Volkswagen dealer.
Amazingly, it took them two months to locate the fault, obtain parts
(a fuel pump relay, distributor rotor and ignition coil) and implement
the fix.  Later we learned that this dealer had given up business so
perhaps other troubles added to the delay.  Yet, it should be pointed
out that all replacements and service costs were picked up by the
warranty.

So if the Vanagon's reliability has been spotty, is driving it still
fun?  The answer is yes without hesitation.  It has a lot to do with the
basic control's offering a delightful directness of feel.  On the road,
the bus responds accurately to the driver's wishes, somehow managing to
belie its outward sheet-metal barn-like look.  And, it has been a part
of many enjoyable excursions:  It has been used to camp out in at races,
visit the Oregon Sea Lion Caves, stop at every weaving shop and used
book store from here to Eugene and go through the California wine
country several times.  We look forward to the next 12,000 miles and
hope that our Vanagon's reliability improves.

Extended-Use Report: Volkswagen Vanagon at 24,000 miles
                     Versatile people and object hauler
Road &amp; Track, December 1983

We admit this 24,000-mile report is somewhat anticlimatic.  If you're
inspired to run off to your local Volkswagen dealer to buy a new Vanagon
like ours, you'll be disappointed: there aren't any more. The air-cooled
van has been superseded by the water-cooled Vanagon Wasserboxer (R&amp;T,
June 1983).  But this report isn't all that pointless, because only the
engine is changed.  The rest of the water-cooled Vanagon is the same
boxy vehicle the R&amp;T staff has come to know and respect during the past
year.  And, as it turns out, the air-cooled engine was the primary
source of our complaints about the Vanagon anyway.

During the first 12,000 miles (R&amp;T, April 1983) our Vanagon seemed to be
infested with Black Forest gremlins that loved to play tricks with the
electrical system.  Coy little creatures, they always struck at the most
inopportune times, like when the VW was at the summit of a mountain in a
national park, or in the midst of the Mojave Desert.  Then, after
lengthy tows back to civilization, in this case defined as any burg with
a Volkswagen dealer, the gremlins would immediately stop their
shenanigans, leaving the Vanagon running perfectly, much to the
befuddlement of both the driver and dealer mechanic.

We've since learned that our Vanagon was not unique in this respect.
Readers and dealer service managers tell us that other Vanagons have
these strange, intermittent electrical power losses, too.  Indeed, in
recent years Volkswagens in general, including Rabbits and Sciroccos,
have been plagued with electrical system malfunctions.  The problems
are rarely serious in that they don't require extensive parts replace-
ments, but they do render the car inoperative and are time-consuming
to trace.

With the Vanagon, there doesn't seem to be any single cause:  both the
electrical fuel injection (Bosch L-Jetronic) and, more likely, the
electronic ignition (with a Hall distributor) can be the culprits.
Gordon Cline and Andy Vaughn, two capable fellows in the service
department at Commonwealth Volkswagen in Santa Ana, California, try to
isolate the problem with a procedure that begins by cleaning the
connection at the idle stabilizer and ends with checking for corrosion
in the power supply for the impulse coil.  Cline and Vaughn say it's
often must a simple matter of a loose or dirty connection.  On one
occasion a thousand miles from home, our Vanagon's engine died,
stranding the Engineering Editor by the side of the road.  Under trying
conditions -- the VW was packed to the gunwales with friends who hurled
epithets about foreign cars -- the EE attempted to effect a cure with
his Swiss Army knife.  Instead, he discovered an innocuous blade-type
connector had slipped apart, which left the entire electrical system
without a ground.  It's odd that the wizards of Wolfsburg would choose
such an insubstantial way of securing such a cricitcal connection.

We can report, however, that after the third stranding and replacement
of the fuel pump relay, distributor rotor and ignition coil at about the
11,000-mile mark, the gremlins tired of our Vanagon and departed. The VW
carried on for another 13,000 miles with no hint of electrical trouble.

In fact, the second 12,000 miles was rather uneventful from a repair
standpoint.  At around 16,000 miles the engine began weeping oil.
Apparently the pushrod tube seals on either side of the flat 4-cylinder
engine frequently become embrittled by engine heat.  Commonwealth
performed a fix using Porsche 911 seals, more expensive but also more
durable than VW's.  This was done under VW's standard 1-year or 20,000-
mile warranty, which, by the way, has been extended for 1983 to one year
with unlimited mileage.  Had the Vanagon been out of warranty, we would
have been charged three hours of labor and $40 for the Porsche seals for
both sides.

Beyond this, there were a couple of routine services, at 15,000 miles
and 22,500 miles.  At the latter service we had the front end aligned
to eliminate some wheel shimmy. At that time the air conditioner belt
also needed adjustment.  You may recall from the 12,000-mile report that
the large overhead air conditioning unit had been a source of constant
trouble.  We've learned that reliability of the Vanagon's air
conditioner is a function of how expertly the unit was installed, which
can vary considerably because all of them are dealer installed.  For
instance, if the stock engine mounts are not changed, the unit will
often have chronic belt-throwing fits.  For 1984, air conditioners will
be installed at the factory in the Fatherland, which should mean fewer
problems.

Altogether we paid $253.34 for repairs and routine maintenance during
the 24,000 miles.  Incidentally, Volkswagen calculates that repairs done
under warranty were worth $364.  At an overall average of 19.1 mpg, we
spent nearly $1700 for gasoline.  Including $2945 for depreciation, but
not including such variables as insurance, state taxes and delivery
charges, the Vanagon cost a reasonable 20.4 cents/mile during our
extended-use test.

Besides the electrical system, there was another aspect of the Vanagon's
air-cooled engine that continually bugged us: a lack of power.  On the
straight and level the Vanagon cruised along nicely with a low noise
level.  But in climbing grades or moving away from stoplights this
oversize Beetle is more tortoise than hare.  Lack of acceleration
combined with an occasionally balky transmission linkage that made
finding 1st gear a real crapshoot added up to major frustration at
times.  Here the water-cooled engine offere some real improvement, with
a 22-percent increase in horsepower.

The engine aside, the rest of the Vanagon was a joy. We used it to carry
everything from a rowing shell to a hockey team, and it did so with
aplomb.  The interior proved not only commodious, but comfortable.  Our
Vanagon GL had none of the austerity of its ancestors, the flower-
power, hippy VW vans of the Sixties.  Instead, the seats for seven were
plush, covered in materials you would expect to find in an elegant
European sedan.  And the interior stood up well under use too.  There
were a few minor failings -- a window winder, a side-window seal and a
piece of torn carpeting.  But at the end of our tenure, the interior
seemed nearly as fresh as it did when we took delivery.

Despite the Vanagon's lack of spunk, staff members were otherwise
delighted with its character on the road.  Drivers unfamiliar with this
genre of VW often had preconceived notions of a truck-like
ponderousness, not unreasonable considering its resemblance to a city
bus.  But the first mile usually dispelled such ideas. Time and again,
drivers commented on how the Vanagon rode and steered like a regular
car.

As something of a backhanded tribute to its maneuverability, several
staff members forgot about the Vanagons' bulk.  Consequently, it
accumulated a few dings and dimples, including a bash on the top when
one driver discovered that his garage door opener reduced clearance
more than he thought.  However, the Vanagon will go through car washes,
an important consideration because the tops of vans are always a real
chore to hand wash.

We've always thought the Volkswagen to be the best of its kind,
especially when pitted against Detroit's offerings in recent years.
But now the people-hauler market is rapidly changing. Toyota is
entering the fray with its Van Wagon and Chrysler has recently
introduced its T-115 and Vista (nee Mitsubishi Chariot).  After living
with the Vanagon and its air-cooled engine's deficiencies for 24,000
miles, we question whether VW could have maintained its advantage
against these newcomers. But with the new Wasserboxer engine, the king
of vans has a good shot at retaining its crown.
