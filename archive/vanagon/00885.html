&gt; &gt; &gt; Quick question.  I have an '80 vanagon which recently
&gt; &gt; &gt; passed Virginia emissions with flying colors.  I am moving
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Sacramento, CA in two months.  I am assuming I may

&gt; &gt; Welcome to my stomping ground Joseph.  Are coming here to work or

&gt; The best solution is to buy a pre-'66  ( a REAL bus by any standard :)
&gt;

&gt; vehicle here, in addition to the normal extravagant fees.  It might be
&gt; easier overall to just keep it registered in Virginia.

Don't do this!!  The fines that you will have to pay when the men in blue
catch you (and they *will* catch you) will make the $300 smog abatement fee 
look like small potatos.  And you will end up paying the fee as well.  This
happened to a friend of mine, and it ain't pretty.  

&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to Sacramento!  Welcome to California!

Yes - welcome to California!  It's a great place (despite the earthquakes,
crime, and outragous fees/fines/taxes/housing prices).  Just wait 'til you
see the coastline (Big Sur, yum!!)
