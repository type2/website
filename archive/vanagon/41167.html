Subject: Rumba is DeAd

hey now,

just talked to my friend sean, who took a look at my bus today. looks
like the engine might have run hot this weekend, causing the valve seat to
drop and a cylinder stoped working damaging the head. now i'm looking at
whether to a) fix it b) new engine. prices are going to be about the same i
thing. any ideas? wow, can words express the feelings i have about this stupid
vw van? tis a sad day indeed. silly ain't it? getting attached to a van? one
option is getting a 165hp engine for $2100! hehehe i'm not sure what i'm going
to do. sean reccommended i keep the van since it's so solid....i will be out of
commision all this spring, possibly into summer. wow. that sucks. and i have no
$$$. oh well. such is life.

later,

jonathan ('74 Retrowestie Rumba, in critical condition)
