Subject: RE: Where can I rent a CO meter in East Bay (CA)


I finally broke down and went to a local &quot;German Auto Repair&quot; shop.

I explained what I needed (timing, idle speed, idle mixture) and he
pretended to look up the shop time this job would take in one of those
big thick book, then hit his calculator a few times (I could see he
wasn't really calculating anything) and then announced the job would
be $46.

It took him 15 minutes to get his Sun analyzer working, then he shoved
the sniffer up the tailpipe.  When I told him the manual said to make
this test in *front* of the catalytic converter, he looked startled
but then recovered by saying that the smog emission folks check after
the converter (I told him I had to have the bus smogged soon) and besides,
in his experience, &quot;everytime I've tried to remove the bolt from the
exhaust, they end up breaking.&quot;

When he checked the timing he said it was OK (I knew that - I set it 
myself!) but explained that since I didn't have an idle stabilizer
the timing was moving around.  (The timing, when I set it, was rock-
steady; and I know that the idle stabilizer works by *adjusting* the
timing!)

While he was working we yacked a bit and he deliverd all sort of
dubious (to me information); don't use Shell gas, always use super
premium gas, etc., etc.

I left the shop $46 poorer, convinced, once again, that I knew more
about my bus then the German-car &quot;pro&quot; I had just dealt with.

I see that JCW has a CO tester in their catalog for $150; all I have to
do is go to this guy twice more and I've paid for it!

&gt; CO Meters are expensive and hard to come by.  In the early eighties, I =

&gt; dealer who had a CO meter that you could build.  Yes, it takes a couple =

&gt; Hope this helps
