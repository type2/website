Subject: Was Re: Open letter to.. now, why i drive a vw


hey now,


well...i find this kinda attitude at the local VW parts 
place..T-Hoff...kinda....yeah, i know what ya need, ya ain't gonna get it 
no where else, i think you are an idiot i'll charge ya out the ying yang 
you vw driving fool attitude...

i experienced this when i went to take back a cv joint i'd bought from 
them. sure, i didn't know alot about cv joints then (i'd tackle mine 
again no problem this time) but i KNOW the joint is supposed to move all 
around and not be RUSTED together. they told me all i had to do was grease
them...duh. they were RUSTED. they shrugged and gave me my money back. 
but gave me the above fore mentioned attitude. 

BUT you also have to remember the really kind people. kind of a brethen
or an extended family that comes with having a vw van. people who help 
you when you are brokedown...who you help when they breakdown. the ones 
you share...hey i just did this to the van...the ones you relate your vw
horror storries and your dream trips to. Like Sean the guy whose helping 
me with my vw...he's a mechanic who is honest..not one who'll rip ya off.
cuz VW's to him is a passion and not just a living. the type who's shop 
is a mess but you feel like sitting down on a stool, kicking your feet 
up and shooting the breeze with your engine on blocks at your feet.

oh well, driving down the highway with the wind blowing in my hair, my 
fiancee amanda beside of me, neil young cranked, and knowing it's my van, 
it's the best investement i've ever made...that it's a part of me...the 
van. rumba. my kitchen, my bedroom....THAT is what makes up for the shit 
we put up with....
