Well..... they shimmy ..... your eyes will probably wear out from all the 
action.  Not flannel  ... sort a native look ... sort of 
native/afro/earthy/islander/sexy or something. It's unique. I've never 
seen performaces and costumes like theirs. Very energetic. When you're 
out in the wilderness there for awhile, it's a fun break for an evening.
All the locals come, and lots of travelers too.
