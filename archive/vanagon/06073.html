&gt; I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both
&gt; thought it might be kind of fun to have a fall or even winter
&gt; gathering of west coasters from the list (anyone else who wants
&gt; to make the trip, welcome, too, of course!).  We both liked the
&gt; idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
&gt; even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
&gt; of Yosemite.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking of something like maybe a weekend, Friday evening
&gt; through Sunday afternoon in a campground in Novemeber, December,
&gt; or January. 
&gt; 
&gt; Would any of you be interested?

I would be interested.  One thing that might be of concern to some
trippers is that Sequoyah will most likely require chains.  I visited
in late February this year, and chains were required then, and there 
was snow all over the roads.

I rented chains at the Chevron outside the park, for $7.50 a day, so
if you don't have them, it's no big deal.

Sequoyah is a _much_ better park than Yosemite, anyway!  Yosemite is
more like a resort.
