Subject: Sway Bars

I have a '77 that I am trying to put sway bars.  I ordered Sway-A-Way bars
from The Bus Stop (Rocky Mountain Motorwerks).  In addition, I ordered the
optional stainless steel clamp set.  I am having trouble with the clamps.
The bars bolt on fine, but the clamps seem too small to go all the way
around the suspension arm and sway bar.  Has anyone else had a problem like
this.  I am probably just going to buy a new set of stock clamps becase they
will work.  Are the clamps only for pre-'67 busses or something?
