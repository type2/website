Subject: air bags, My .02 worth

Hi Volks,
   I happen to notice a thread recently about passenger side air bags.  I
thought I would throw in my .02 worth.  Anyway,  I aggree that childern
shouldn't sit in the front seat of any car with air bags. Definitly bad
news. i saw a story on the news the other nite about a child being kill
after the passenger airbag went off. Unforunatly it was in a Jetta and the
crash wasn't even that bad as far as damage was concerned. (bad press for
VW) Your right about it  being the parents responsiblity for the childs
safty. That goes for even seat belts.  I've never been a big fan of seat
belt laws, but I do think they are a good idea for kids.  Kids cannot be
responsible nor are they in control in situations like that and the law
works for them.
   I noticed that 'Generous Motors' started installing off switches in
their '97 trucks.  I guess that sometimes you can't get around not putting
a child in the front seat.   Someone said something about putting the bag
back after it has gone off.  Well, from what I can tell one the bag goes
off it destroys the dash and front window as well as the steering wheel.
The first time I saw a car after a cash and the airbag went off I thought
the poor guy went through the window. (I didn't know it had a passenger
airbag at the time)   Well, I guess I'll step down form my soap box.

BTW, did anyone see the Vanagon on the X-Files last Sunday? (VW content)=)
Take care.
