&gt; &gt;   these stuff contains some kind of acetic acid which may attack the
&gt; &gt;   aluminium. I just replaced the gaskets and have substituted the silicone
&gt; 
This is entirely true, most RTV silicone does contain acetic acid as
a base which dissapears into the surroundings when cured.  Dad works
for AT&amp;T and told me there are two grades of RTV Silicone, they used
to use the acetic acid based stuff (smells like vinegar) but the
fumes it gave off cracked and crazed the surface of plastic splice
shields on the fiber and coax lines.  The acetic acid stuff will eat
at a lot of plastics, ABS included and indeed may start the problem
corroding the aluminum, there is a solution the other grade of silicone
sealer commonly called electrical grade uses a different base material,
though I can't remember what, the caveat is that it costs 4 or 5 times
as much.  Still change that antifreeze.
