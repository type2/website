Subject: Parkway/ BuRPOBaT report

 Howdy all, I hadn't planned to be back yet, but things which I shall detail
later have made that the case...
  Anyway, I had a wonderful time at Busses on the Parkway! I finally got to put
a lot of faces with names that I see here all the time.  We arrived Friday
morning at about 11 or so, just to make sure we got a good spot. Well, we
shouldn't have worried, since the fog kept a lot of people away, and there
wasn't any crowding, or lack of spaces.  The weather was indeed foggy, but it
didn't actually rain much during the days, and it had cleared up by Sunday, of
course as we were leaving!
  There were lots of busses, and good bus people. Uncle Joel and Dave Schwarze
came all the way from Alabama and Texas, and other listee's came in from
surrounding states. It was great to hang out with all of you. Some of the bus
 highlights were a BEAUTIFUL 70 Dormobile, with a Westfalia interior unlike
anything I've ever seen, and actually seeing Dave Schwarze's Safare camper. It
has an ingenious interior lay out, and seven of us were able to hang out inside
for a few hours in style and comfort in the rain... that's pretty hard in a
regular bus lay-out. I also was astounded by listee Bob Busick's 20,000 some
mile ORIGINAL 69 Westy. It's like stepping into a time machine. Everything is
shiny and new. Man, it's amazing. I'd be afraid to drive it, for fear of
denting or scratching something...
  Alas, the rain dampened any attempts to burn anything signifigant, although
Dave did show us how oil makes a fire better. :)
  My late model pop-top transplant slept beautifully, and I know I'm really
going to enjoy that. The canvas even stayed dry through several torrential
downpours, for which I am grateful. :)
  I sold the rest of the Search and Rescue t-shirts, as well as the extra
travel mugs, and lots of stickers. Many thanks to everyone who bought
those...I'll probably do more shirts in a couple months...
  As for the Outer Banks trip, I wasn't able to make that. My girlfriend and I
had been planning the trip since traveling last summer, and then she broke up
with me a couple weeks ago. That, coupled with the forecast for nasty weather,
and my less-than-2-months-old rebuilt starter crapping out on me, all kinda
made me decide not to go. However, 4 busses are still out there having a blast.
We did have to do more repairs to one bus's brake system, but that got
straightened out, and they left yesterday afternoon...
So anyway, it was a great bus-filled weekend, and I hope to meet more of you at
the one next year!
