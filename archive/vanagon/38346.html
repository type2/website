Subject: LiMBO's Rites of Spring...possible NE V_at_L gathering??


Sunday May 5 is LiMBO's annual Transporter Rites of Spring at Duxbury =
Beach (near Plymouth, MA). Perhaps we can twist Jim D's arm to use this =
as a Vanagon-list gathering for us New Englanders?

Howabout it Moe and Hal...we could have a gathering of the EVs?

I could be convinced to make a batch of homebrew for the occasion...

What do you think folks?

Ric
