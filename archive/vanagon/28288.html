Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;Well Jim,
&gt;You may not be a pinhead about determing the worth of your auto parts,
&gt;but your stance on the scantily clad women in magizines and ads leads me
&gt;to believe differently about how you determine the worth of other human
&gt;beings.  If you MUST partake in the degradation of women, buy magazines
&gt;devoted to that, but there is no reason why a VW (or any other car)
&gt;magizine HAS to have anybody objectified.
&gt;I didn't want to go on a rant about this, but how we act as VW owners,
&gt;and whatever else we all are, has a tremendous bearing on many other
&gt;people. It seems that you have the advantages that allow you to be
&gt;&quot;politically incorrect and proud of it&quot; but the majority of people
&gt;don't.  Try being considerate of other people, it really doesn't hurt...
&gt;anyone.

Shazam, Cap'n.  I think the Enterprise took a direct hit.  Beam me outa here!
