&gt;&gt;There was some good information about changing coolant at a web site or ftp
&gt;&gt;site. At least it looked good to me after changing the coolant &quot;by the book&quot;
&gt;&gt;a few times!  I think it involved installing a &quot;T&quot; under the van near the
&gt;&gt;front and doing some other special things.


Boy did I ever have to do some &lt;&lt;special&gt;&gt; things to change the coolant in
MY '69 bus. ;-)
