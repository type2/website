Subject: re: Wasserboxer Engine Life

I have a 86 Westy that lasted 187K before I ran it toooo far without 
water  :( . It now has an engine transplant and is off and running 
again.

Trust your oil pressure light, but not your water temp gage. The water 
temp shows normal range once the senser is reading &quot;air.&quot; Live and 
learn!

Regards, Vance
