&gt; &gt;&gt;now, as to &quot;blackmail&quot; ... well, i don't know. i mean, it's not like
&gt; &gt;&gt;they're  gonna tell everyone about Steve and that chicken last summer if
&gt; &gt;&gt;he doesn't buy a new car ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I wasn't there. Nobody saw me do it. And the chicken volunteered.
&gt; 
&gt; NOT YOU!!! Steve Johnson!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; soooo ... how'd you get the chicken to &quot;volunteer&quot;???
&gt; 

Now wait a minute Joel!!  Read my lips!!  I didn't say I was doing anything
'with' a chicken.  I said &quot;Chokin' my chicken&quot;.   ;)

Damned Alabama hicks, ya gotta explain 'everything' to them.  ;p
