Subject: Re: Losing Power (the solution)

I want to thank everyone for the help on my problem (losing power climbing
I-80 up to Lake Tahoe.)  The winning answer was the O2 sensor.  When it was
unplugged, the problem disappeared.

I had the choice of replacing it with a generic sensor for $44, or a Bosch
for $85 (single wire).  I went with the Bosch, and also decided to let German
Motors  in Lake Forest do it (aka George's), based on recommendations from
several of you.  While looking things over they found a lot of parts that
were cracked, decrepit, or out-of-date (expansion tanks, distributor cap,
rotors, plug wires, temperature switches).  It was akin to a house
remodeling.  I'm now up to date.  I also found George to have a much more
proactive (and probably more expensive) approach the Fred's Garage in Redwood
City, where I usually take my '85 Westy.  George seemed to have good reasons
for all the changes.   Have others seen this difference?  The reasoning I got
at George's seemed sound.  Fred's just seems to fix what is broken, and not
be concerned with parts that can be updated or improved.

Also I was told that I should be using distilled water with the non-phosphate
coolant.  Anyone else doing this?
