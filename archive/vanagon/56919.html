Here Here!  At 6'5&quot; (195cms) I sleep very comfortably in my Westy.  I have yet to try the upper bunk but that's another story.  Not a day goes by where I don't marvel at the vast number of ammenities available in a Westy that still manages to give one a spacious feel.  

Vive le Westy!

&gt;        Here is the problem....If you are over 5'10&quot; you will not be
&gt;happy in the Rialta.  None of the beds are over 6' long.  I (at 6'3&quot;)
&gt;was uncomfortble just standing stooped shouldered in the thing, and
&gt;there would be know way for me to get a good night of sleep in it. 
&gt;Thank God for the Westy conversion sleeping and headroom space.
&gt;
&gt;        I won't even talk about the $73,000 the guy paid for it.  I'd
&gt;rather buy 6 more Syncros...one for each day of the week.
