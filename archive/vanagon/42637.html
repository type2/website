&gt;I have a question concerning the VIN from my '67 Westy.

VINs are one of those neat little things that can tell alot about your VW.
 Up through the 1964 model year, VW just used serial numbers.  Starting in
65, they went to a 9 digit VIN, in 70 a 10 digit VIN and in 81 a 17 digit VIN
(and that one is the craziest lokking yet, but real easy to decipher when ya
get to know the system).  For simplicity, we'll just concentrate on your VIN.
 The first three digits indicate the model and the year, i.e. &quot;24&quot; is a model
241 or &quot;Microbus Deluxe&quot;, which is what it was when VW delivered it to
Westfalia for their modifications.  The 3rd digit, 7 indicates the model year
which, since the mid 50's begins in August of the previous year, example the
1967 model year is from August 1966 thru July 1967. The last six digits are
the actual serial number of the vehicle. (note: 70-79 models, the last seven
digits are the serial number)  Sometimes the date of production is handy for
those mid year changes.  For instance - Early 67's had the single circuit
Master Cylinder thru October 1966 (VIN 2x7 019 415, x being the model
designator).  The engine number you provided sounds about right for this year
and not from a 73 Beetle, which had AE, AH, AJ &amp; AK serial numbered engines.

My .005 cents worth :-)
