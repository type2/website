I'll vouch for that.  This has happened to me several times over the last
couple of years. The horn going off unexpectedly, that is.  Usually in an
embarassing situation, like sitting behind a cop ;}

It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I finally figured it out.  Now I have
to come up with some sort of plastic ring to cover the gap between the wheel
and the column.  Or I guess I could use non-metallic keys!
