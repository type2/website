What is this, rec.autos.vw? I felt I was being overwhelmed by aircooled 
stuff, which I read nostalgically for the 4 previous aircooled busses I've 
owned. As for being close knit, check out Martha's flannel if you want 
close-knit. The volume of traffic is way down with Gerrys reconfiguring of 
the list response, works fine for me. Keep the peace.  tim s.
