Subject: Need transmission for an '85

Hey guys!

The transmission in my '85 Vanagon is whining and I've been told it's the
pinion gear.  I've also been told that my best bet is to find a used one and
switch it out, in lieu of having it repaired.  Is this true?  If so, does
anyone out there have one they are willing to sell and subsequently UPS to
Hampton Va.  
Also, how difficult will it be for someone with moderate mechanical skills to
install one.  In other words, would I be better of paying a professional to
do the work.
