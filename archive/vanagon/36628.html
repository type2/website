Subject: Bay window for sale in Bay Area

Not mine... I just saw it while I was driving along.  It's in Oakland, CA.
First, info found on sign in window of said bus:

  $1100 OBO 510-531-5233
  Just tuned up, Compression is: 1     2     3     4
				130   135   130   130
  New Cat, EGR filter, muffler bearings.
  Windshield has a crack on passenger side, but bus includes another 
  windshield.

Ok... what I saw.  It's a 7 seater, sunroof with black seats.  Rear seats 
in good condition, front seats had covers on them.  Headliner is in fair 
condition.. has a few rips.  I couldn't see any rust on the outside.  
Paint is pretty faded.  Tires are standard load with some life left in 
them.  The VIN# is 2262101993, so I guess it's a '76... I didn't know 
they had catalytic converters then.

I looked in the back and thought I saw a Westy jump seat stored back 
there.  Not attached or anything.. just sitting on it's side.

Bradley
