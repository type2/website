Subject: Re: Spare Tire Question

&gt;Perry,
&gt;
&gt;The spare tire mount under the front of the vehicle will only comfortably
&gt;hold a standard VW rim with a 185 tyre.Any wider and you get the problem
&gt;that you described.
&gt;
&gt;Yes,VW did offer alloy rims as an option however they are only the same
&gt;width (5 1/2&quot;) as the steel rims.They just looked better than the 
&gt;standard steelies.Recommended tyre was still 185R x 14&quot; so they still fit.
&gt;
&gt;My van has 15&quot; alloys with 215 60's and I have no hope of fitting one of
&gt;those under the front.I have a 5th one which I take on long trips otherwise
&gt;I rely on the original spare with it's original 185R 70 14&quot; which remains
&gt;under the front of the car as an emergency spare to limp to a service
&gt;station.My new wheels are virtually the same overall diameter as the
&gt;originals so whilst driving on a combination isn't particularly good for
&gt;handling,at least I can use it if needed without doing any damage.
