Subject:      91 Vanagon

Hi there!

I have a 91 Vanagon, that has only 24,000 miles on it.  A super stereo
system
was installed and some conservative custom painting was completed when it
was
new, and the car was entered in IASCA sound off events.  To make a long
story
short, in the 91 season, the car never finished less than 3rd in any
contest
and went to the finals in Oklahoma City and finished 3rd in the nation.  I
installed the system myself with no prior experienced in electronics or
stereo installations!  (I did ask experts a ton of questions during the
install).

One of the criterea in the judging is the asthetics of the install and the
overall appearance of the vehicle, ie outside, interior, and engine
compartment.  I have been looking for some after market items to dress out
the Vanagon engine compartment, ie crome valve covers and any other
dress-ups
and upgrades to the engine and exterior that anyone has available.  I've
been
looking thru the magazines VW Trends &amp; Hot VW's &amp; the JC Whitney Catalog,
but
to no avail.  The car has been in storage for 4 years + and I want to put
it
back on the road again soon.  (The interior is currently gutted).  Can you
point me into the right direction for some good info?
