Subject: EV manuals

Well, the EV manuals arrived today. They appear to be the same ones that
Trace received awhile back. Although these have big yellow stickers saying
that they're being provided under Federal law and aren't really meant for
people without factory training! They also have a disclaimer saying that
they were derived from the VW-AG manuals for Britain and Europe.

Included was a set of 3 Technical Bulletin updates - mainly for wiring
diagrams and some troubleshooting sections. Last update was 9/93. That
tells me something.
They changed the bulletin format in 1993, so they obsoleted the 1992
Canadian wiring diagrams - if anyone is interested I could send them. No
guarantees regarding their accuracy though.

Other manuals I don't need: automatic transmission and diesel engine. Maybe
the &quot;CV Camper and MV&quot; but I may decide to hang onto it - the CV Camper
looks like the one they should have imported! It has 2 aux batteries, and
has a control panel up over the rear view mirror for electrical and status.
A nice touch.
I looked around briefly for that rear heating duct that Tim (?) had such
problems with but didn't see it at first glance.
I did find the coolant fan fuses though - those are 50A fuses - quite a lot
of current! (That doesn't seem right - I'll bet they're really on 5.0A)

Also I had heard about the twin door models but here there are pictures -
apparently they were only released in Canada. They also mention flatbeds
and models with dual sliding doors.

And stuff on the rear fog lights - these seem like a really smart thing -
anyone know if they're available in the US? (Also, does the person who
offered to get   proper European fog light switches still subscribe?)

Anyway, if anyone was waiting to hear - these are clearly the factory
manuals. Lots of references to VAG tools. Instructions for downloading the
Engine Control Module diagnostic codes, etc.  Lots of diagrams of engines
and how a lot of stuff goes together. Not a lot of hand-holding. I suspect
that the Bentley will still be a good thing to get *if* they ever get it
out.

Now I'm waiting for the Winnebago manual to come in - that one was only US$20.
