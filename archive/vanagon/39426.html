Subject: Bosch 009 on T4?

I have a 009 dist. on my newly rebuilt type four engine.  I can't get 
the right setup for the distributor.  Number 2 and number 4 cylinders 
are not firing.  I have checked the intake, points, spark plugs, plug 
wires, and valve lash.  All of these things are fine.  When I start up the
engine, the engine will  idle for about ten seconds then die out.  The same 
thing happens with the number 2 and 4 plug wires removed.   

1.  When number 1 is at TDC, where should the mark on the distributor 
housing be relative to a axis through the center of the distributor 
parallel to the case parting line axis?

2.  should the rotor be pointing to this mark when number 1 is at 
TDC?

3.  Are there any tricks to using a 009 on a T4? Besides getting a 
vacuum advanced dist :-)

Thanks,

Aaron
