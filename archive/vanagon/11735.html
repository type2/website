&gt; Thanks for the advice.  I've been fighting this one ever since I got the
&gt; Vanagon (never had it with my three bread loaves).  Usually, I listen for
&gt; the sound of the thing getting near full and try to back off so that I
&gt; can catch it just before it acts silly, but some locations are near such
&gt; noisy roads (and my aged hearing isn't what it used to be ... and never
&gt; was) that I get a fountain anyway.  I'll try turning the nozzle sideways
&gt; to see how that works.  Does it matter which way you turn it, left or
&gt; right?

Hello, Jerry--
I turn the nozzle so that the hose end aims toward the rear of the 
Vanagon. But it might not make any difference if it is turned the other 
way. I think the &quot;splash sensor&quot; becomes more sensitive when the nozzle 
is in at a different angle. Experiment!
