Subject: Reading VIN

My VIN is WV2ZB0257FH051307.  In looking at some tech bulletins, they 
refer to VINs liek 25 FM 050 887 Dec 84 and 25 FH 037 898 Nov 94.  My 
camper was picked up on site in Germany in late January, 85, so I suppose 
it was built sometime in the fall of '84 - around the VINs shown.

So - how do I read my VIN to know whether mine is earlier or later than 
those show?

I assume skip everything up to the 25, then skip the 7.  Is that right?  
And how do I get a date out of that?  Thanks.
