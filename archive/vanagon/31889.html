Subject: Heaters(again)

OK everybody, here are some general questions about the heaters in the 
older buses.

Next Monday I am going to get motivated and put my 74 on ramps and go to 
work on the heater system.  I want to get some kind of heat before this 
camping trip up here in WA.  BTW, has a date been decided for that yet?

I will probably check out the flappers that control the temp of the hot 
air, as the others seem to be working alright.  I noticed in my 
Haynes(rather useless) that there is a secondary blower under the floor.  
Is this an option, or do all buses have this?  Is there any way to 
replace it with one whose speed can be controlled?  I haven't looked 
under it since reading about it, but I have been under the bus (too) many 
times before and don't remember seeing one. 

Also, since I'm on the sublect of lame manuals, I had my wiper bearings 
seize up in the middle of a big rainstorm.  The wipers barely made it 
back to their resting position before they died for good.  After checking 
out the manual, which basically says 

1.Remove the flexible(!) heater tubes.
2.Take out the bolt that holds the wiper motor to the dash.
3.Back out the entire assembly.
4.Revers steps to install

I figured it would be no problem.  Has anyone done this?  I spent about 3 
hours fighting the wires and linkages and NON-FLEXIBLE heater tubes and 
still couldn't do it.  I finally got the thing out, but knew there was no 
way in hell I could get it back in.  I'd already lost about a quart of 
blood from various cuts on my hands, and being 6'5&quot; I was all cramped up 
from laying between the seats.  I spent the money for one hours worth of 
labor and highly recommend that anyone else out there do the same.
