hmmm. that's a thought. anybody know anything about &quot;loop&quot; antennas? like
having one big loop around the inside of the pop-top? if it works for the
old tv sets, why wouldn't it work for a cb transmitter??

&gt;and traded the tape player for the option.  I like it a lot but need some
&gt;more power.  Is there a booster I can add?

as i understand it, the only thing you can LEGALLY do is to take the radio
to a radio-repair person and have him/her tweek the set to obtain the
maximum legal output. otherwise you can get an illegal linear amplifier and
put in the line from the set to the antenna.

but all that does is make you much louder much farther away. i'm not sure
what it does for your reception. and finding one of low enough power might
be a problem ... most are made for ham radios and are up in the 100 watt
range (whereas the normal cb radio is allowed 5 watts output). those linear
amplifiers are also illegal as hell. :) even though lots of turckers use
them, and the FCC seems to have just given up on cb radio, it's still illegal.

any hams wanna comment?
