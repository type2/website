So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; Here in California, all busses since 75 (or is it 76?) have them,
&gt; so it is certainly feasible!  If it is convenient for you to do
&gt; so, then go for it, since we all have to use unleaded now anyway!
&gt; I'm not sure that it is because of catalytic convertere (I suspect
&gt; it is) but lately I have noticed that every time I smell exhaust

Yes.  The reason for leaded gas becoming scarce is because of the 
concern of the toxic lead itself being pumped into the air.  When 
cars came out with catalytic converters they also had the little 
stickers saying to use only unleaded fuel because the lead would 
coat the platinum honeycomb in the cavity of the catalytic converter 
rendering them useless.
