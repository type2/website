&gt;However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
&gt;submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
&gt;electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
&gt;on the word processor.

Do NOT stop. Good prose is where you find it, people, and it's rare.
Gutenberg made it more accesible, but it was no less rare. The Internet
makes it more accesible still, but it's no less rare. I am gasping from a
Biblical deluge of information, but still good prose is almost impossible
to find. If the difference between good and other is not apparent to you,
kindly tap on your space bar and move on to something else, and leave the
rest of us alone.
