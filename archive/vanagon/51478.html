Subject: Blaup.  'Washington' details pls.

Hi all, anyone know the power output of this unit, OEM in the '87? What's
the wattage for 4 speaker config., and when bridged for 2 speaker operation.
DPO/dealer emptied the glove box of any traceable reading material.
Thinking of swapping out for a 25W/side Sony unit.

Minor note from the dealer, a 9Volt transistor battery will sustain the
radio code and presets when you need to remove the radio or battery for long
term. Dealer has power unit that plugs into cig. lighter, useful widget.

Anyone know how long you can interupt the power before it forgets the code?
I've done about 20 secs, but don't feel like Russian roulette.  My VCR hold
its settings for about 10 minutes when power dies.

Thanks, Tim


OH, final request....  I've had only about 5 messages today since AM (no
Statz!) Does anyone even care? bye.
