Subject: Interesting Bus found

        I saw a very interesting bus today, although it wasn't a VW.  It was
a 1959 Mercedes O319B (&quot;O&quot; as in Oscar, not nezo)

        From the back, it looks like a barndoor deluxe on steroids, and
there was a version with roof windows, as well as a panel version.   It has
split-window bus headlights (frame, bucket and all) and has similar belt
trim, the bakelight dome lights from a barndoor, and some other pieces that
look really close.  It has the large lid in the back, but its for luggage,
not a motor.  This thing seats up to 18 people, but only has a 1.7L motor,
mounted in front, making it quite the wimpster, I'm sure.  A diesel version
was also available; the &quot;B&quot; designator means &quot;benzin,&quot; or gasoline.

        The similarities between this vehicle and a VW bus are astonishing.

        There are not many of these here in the US, but a lot in Europe.
The guy who owns it is looking for a lot of parts for it, if any of you
European guys have leads on parts, lemme know, OK?
