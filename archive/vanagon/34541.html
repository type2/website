&gt;Where exactly is this canister that collects the fuel?  I think I should 
&gt;take a look at it.  Once or twice I've filled the tank up, parked on a 
&gt;hill (driver's side downhill) and had gas spill out.  Not too safe, and I 
&gt;was wondering what it was that caused the spill.  The tubes look pretty 
&gt;good, but I'd like to check out the canister.  Is it a difficult repair?  
&gt;Everything else on the bus is in original condition, and I don't think 
&gt;the PO would have tampered with this system, but maybe someone did.

When I first got the '72 whenever I filled it up a large amount of gas would
leak.  Found out that a rubber &quot;elbow&quot; on top of the gas tank had dry-rotted.
 It didn't cost much for a new elbow and it was easy to replace.  Getting to
was another matter though (Step 1:  Take out engine).
