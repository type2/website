Subject: Re: vintagvw List



To All:

Many vintage VW subscribers found my postings of value.  The list 'owner'
deemed one of them 'inappropriate,' explaining it would be necessary for him
to 'review' my submissions before inflicting them on the subscribers.  Hitler
and Stalin used the same logic to control the free exchange of information.

If Hitler taught us nothing else, we should at least have learned the evils
of censorship.  When an info-Nazi gains control of a list, especially one
supported by the taxpayers, its time to pull the plug.

My software is quite primitive (286 platform) yet I have the ability to
vanish assholes up their own.  I don't need anyone to do my thinking for me.
