Subject: flange fixed

Thanks to those who gave me advice about the plastic (now metal) flange 
that connects the coolant hose to the right cylinder head.

I bought the part for about $18 and change at the dealer.  I called a few 
mechanics and most of them said that they'd have to bleed/burp the system 
when replacing this part leading to total labor charges of 1 1/2 hours.  
Instead I went to this mechanic who's helped me in the past.  He had 
another guy put his thumb over the hole after he took off the old flange 
thereby preventing any significant coolant loss.  I ended up paying him 
about $22 for the job.

Why don't they mention this thumb method in the bentley?  Come to think 
of it, they don't even mention the part in the bentley.

Good thing y'all are out there.

david
