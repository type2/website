Subject: Re: who purchased the '87 in NYC



&gt;Just curious if anyone on the list purchased the '87 in Brooklyn.  
&gt;While I was on the phone with the guy, he said that someone from 
&gt;Pennsylvania was on the phone.....when I called back it was sold.  
&gt;I guess you gotta act real fast.....

That would be me.  I've been looking for a spare parts van for my 
'85 Westy. This looks like just the ticket, especially since I can 
supposedly drive it home to Pa. rather than pay for a tow.
Speaking of which, has anyone on the list every bought a paper 
transit tag from NYC DMV?  What do I need to bring, what does it 
cost, etc.?
After I take off what I can use or want to save, I'll be parting 
out anything the rest, in case anyone's interested.
