i doubt that anybody would be interested in even a partial explination of 
the physics involved, so i'll just say that the shape of the rear of the 
bus needs more attention than the front for any significant change in the 
resistance to moveing through the air. 

look at dolphins, 747's, the classic tear drop shape, submarines (like 
the soviet alpha class).

the shapes all have a blunt front and a long tapered tail.

this prevents the low pressure area in the rear from forming.
