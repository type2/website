Thanks Joel, no need to go to Atlanta just for us... actually your
mentioning of recalls tiggered something in my mind. When we took the
camper in for service about  four months ago it turns out that there
is a recall on all 80-83 (I think that is the latest year) front
 DOOR SPRINGS which VW will replace at no cost.  Apparently these
springs are prone to failure and can lead to premature exit from
aformentioned vehicle at high speeds. This no joke.... DC

I was pleasantly surprised that the local VW dealer spotted the make and year
of the van and mentioned it and had it done without any hassle.
