Hi,

I think my '87 Syncro will need a rebuild in the next year or so.
Has anyone lately had their engine rebuilt, and how much did it
cost?

Also, I think someone had prices on the the upgrade to the Oettinger
2.6.  For this upgrade, does the computer need to be switched, or does
it automatically increase the fuel flow to keep the bigger cylinders
from running lean?  Is there much of a HP/torque increase by going
to 2.6l?

I think if the HP increase is slight, I might just do a conversion
instead.

And a few comments on high-priced Syncro components:  A buddy of mine
recently had to have the clutch slave cylinder replaced in his Jeep 
Cherokee.  Cost him $750.

While looking for a &quot;cheap&quot; 4x4 to maybe (dare I say it) replace my
beloved Syncro, I thought about buying an old Suzuki Samurai for a 
few thousand.  I called up the dealer to find out how much a new long
block would cost.  No new long blocks, but he'd sell me a short block 
and head for $2000!  The Samurai has a 1.3 four-cyl. engine.  Perhaps
_all_ 4x4s cost an arm and a leg to repair!

-Jim
