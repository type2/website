Subject: need help w/vintage vw list

I know this has been answered before, but I have been tearing my 
hair out trying to follow posted instructions for subscribing to 
the Vintage VW list.  I sent email to listserv_at_sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu, 
with the body of the letter &quot;subscribe vintag vw&quot;, then I tried 
&quot;subscribe&quot;, &quot;subscribe vintag&quot;, &quot;subscribe vintage vw&quot;, and every 
other variation I could think of.

I ended up subscribing to a vintage clothing list.  Now I can tell 
you where to find vintage clothing in Washington DC, but I'm 
_still_ not on the vintage VW list!

Somebody, please tell me what I'm doing wrong!

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
