Subject: Re: FS 1988 Westi w/22K miles!

I just called on this one - sounds like a really nice Westy.

Spoke with the woman who owns it and received the following info:

One owner, dealer maintained, full maintenance records, dealer/service willing
to talk with potential buyer.

Garaged its whole life, only driven on vacation, mainly to Florida
ZBart undercoating.

Standard GL with automatic trans (why I am not interested), no power amenities
I forgot to ask about air/rear wiper!

Non-smoker

TV installed and works on electric hookup, wired for phone, has CB

Awning installed in Florida (while on vacation) at Camping World

Gets 18-22 mpg on highway.

Standard steel wheels.

The woman is older and sounds really nice. The couple has really taken care of
this one. The 22k miles is original, one owner miles.

Why am I not going after it?
I really do not want automatic, or red (if possible). And it is an '88 - older
than I want. Am looking at a '91 with 29k miles and standard. Although the '91
is more expensive, it is more what I want - but someone who loves Westies
should really own this one!
