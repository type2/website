Subject: waterboxer running a little hot--any ideas?

Hi all,

After recently doing a top-end job on my boxer, the van has been running a bit
hot (and just a tad sluggish).  The temp guage reads just a bit over the
halfway point--used to stay at dead center.  So far, it's not overheated beyond
that.  

I've:

1) put in a new thermostat
2) set idle and timing

Any ideas?  Should I be concerned?


Many thanks,

David
