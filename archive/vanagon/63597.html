&lt;&lt; derek  have read your numerous postings on the 16&quot;,  and would love to
 do the same to my 91 synchro but the prices are steep!  the wheelwell
 extensions in particular must be available from some other source in
 europe....i contacted a manufacturer in taiwan who expressed interest
 but needed a sample to copy....any further ideas?  same with a
 brushguard,  as the cost of shipping the msds unit is absurd. 
 however,  if he made the guard in two pieces, it could probably be
 shipped via ups ( post strike, that is ).  let me know what you think
  &gt;&gt;


Hey...on a similar note...anyone want to take over my position as the
unofficial person who was supposed to get the quad round vanagon driving
light grill imported from SA??? Or better yet, any Taiwanese manufacturers
want to repro these? (I still have the list with those of your names on it
who wanted the quad round SA foglight/driving light grille)
any takers??
