Subject: Volkswagen 'quality'



&gt;
&gt; this thing broke on me.  I couldn't believe VW was stupid enough to 
&gt;make the thing out of plastic.

To All:

The history of Volkswagen 'improvements' is more an example of how to
maximize profits by substituting shoddy goods for the real thing, replacing
bronze with zinc die-castings, galvanized steel with cardboard (windscreen
heater ducts) and so on.  At the same time a number of quality and safety
items were compromised in order to cater to the market's demand for more
speed and bettery 'style'.

The success of Volkswagen in America has more to do with the quality of their
advertising agency than the quality of their vehicles.  The later models are
filled with gim-crack devices of little pratical value, over-priced and
difficult to repair.  The early models have their own short-comings but they
don't inlcude the above.

A recent article in the Wall Street Journal about re-importation of
Mexican-built bugs into Germany says a great deal for the quality of
modern-day German products and the management behind them.
