Subject: Houston VW show and swap meet this Sunday

For the Houstonians on our illustrious list (and any others who care to
come, since I don't want to slight anybody ;^), there is a VW show and
swap meet this Sunday from 10am to 3pm at the Splashtown parking lot
(somewhere up I-45 N).

I'll be the one with the pink carnation...ha.
