Subject: Thanks for advice Re: 2 Qs: source for multimeter; size of plug
	 for tranny





Thanks to all for the great response from my two questions.
Regarding the tranny plug... I used the hex head end of a 10mm bolt with 3
nuts screwed on.  I clamped it with a vice grip (tried an adjustable wrench
but it kept turning the individual nuts) and had no problem backing the
plugs out.  I used 1 qt of Mobile 1 and 2.25 qts of 80W 90.  Of course, I
lost an additional .25-.5 qts on the engine, the cardboard on the ground
and other places during the process.  Seems I can't get enough of that
wonderful smell of hypoid gear oil.

Haven't gotten the multimeter, yet, but will probably look at Radio Shack
first.

Thanks again for the great advice,

Karl
