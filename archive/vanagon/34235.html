Subject: Interesting Theft-related Development

     Last night, while I was driving around, I was listening to a talk show 
     on one of our local stations.  There was a lengthy discussion of a new 
     system that is apparently coming on the market now.  According to the 
     developers, this system consists of the following items - all existing 
     within current technology:
     
     1)  Standard anti-theft alarms and related components
     2)  A satellite-based geographic locator receiver
     3)  A cellular telephone
     4)  A microprocessor based control system
     5)  Self-contained backup power for several weeks operation
     
     Again, according to the developers, this system can do a bunch of 
     things, including - -
     
     1) It uses the cellular phone to page the owner if the alarms go off 
        - it can also do this in &quot;silent alarm&quot; mode if you don't want your 
        lights to flash and your horn to honk 
     
     2) If the car is stolen anyway, the owner notifies the alarm company - 
        they trigger the system via cell phone, the system uses the 
        geographic locator to determine the vehicle's location, it 
        communicates back to the alarm company, and the alarm company       
        notifies the police of the location of the stolen vehicle.  
     
     3) The system can be set up as completely passive - to give no 
        indication to the thieves of its presence or operation.        
     
     4) The system can be connected to a variety of components in the car - 
        lights, horn, electric locks, ignition, etc.  - to permit or 
        prevent their operation.  The developers predict that, once the 
        system locates itself and the police have the stolen car in sight, 
        the police could communicate with the alarm company and possible 
        have them kill the ignition and lock the doors to prevent a 
        getaway.
     
     5) The system also has a silent &quot;duress alarm&quot; - a pushbutton located 
        around the driver's seat where it could be pushed by an owner being 
        forced from the car.  Again, this would be &quot;silent&quot; giving no 
        indication of its presence or operation to the thieves while 
        determining location and notifying the alarm company.    
     
     6) A clever parent could also use the system to find out where their 
        teenagers went after the Saturday night movie! 
     
     The cost of this system was something like $650 plus installation - 
     probably around $1000 all told.  They consider their primary market to 
     be new high end cars - $40 or $50K plus.  It seems to me that such a 
     system would also have application to high value modified and restored 
     vintage vehicles like some VW's.
