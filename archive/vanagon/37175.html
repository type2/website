Subject: VW announces Concept D    /f

New York (AP)  Volkswagenwerk AG has announced that it will stop plans
for the widely-hailed &quot;modern Beetle&quot; Concept I car and replace it with
an updated, but still butt-ugly, version of its long-ago mistake,
the Dasher.  &quot;It took us decades to pull the plug on the popular
and easy-to-repair Beetle and replace it with a total dog,&quot; said
Hermann Teufelswerke, spokesman for VW, &quot;we won't wait nearly so
long this time.&quot;

VW dealers, upset that the inexpensive, reliable Beetle might make a comeback,
are heralding the change.  &quot;We hated that thing, it didn't bring in
the kind of customer we were interested in fleecing,&quot; said Dork Luser,
an upstate New York VW dealer, &quot;valve adjusting screws for 50 cents,
where's the profit in that?, now the kind of person interested in
a new Dasher, there's some easy pickings!&quot;

Engine options are expected to include a standard waterboxer
(with VW's famous &quot;self-changing&quot; antifreeze feature), and an
innovative diesel/methane hybrid, which will include a large
fermenting tank to produce the methane.  &quot;Fill it up with
manure, and you're off!&quot; said VW spokesperson Alfred Scheisse,
&quot;just don't actually sit _in_ the car while driving.&quot;

Features include seatbelt interlock, standard 8-track/AM radio,
and beanbag chair rear seats.  Colors include brown.
