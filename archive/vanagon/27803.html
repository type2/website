Subject: re:discount with RMMW visa?

First of all it is a MasterCard, not a Visa (not that there is any
difference, but you still need to make a distinction)

Second I believe it is a 10% discount. I'm not positive on this but I am
sure that you do get a discount

For those who have not seen them yet, the &quot;Standard&quot; MC has a picture of
a '60s 23 window(?) sunroof, and a Bettle 'vert, and a KG 'vert, in
color, along with the RMMW logo in the top corner. The gold card only
has the RMMW logo in one of the corners.

It is offered by MBNA bank.  I don't have this one, but I do have
another rather cool one offered by the bank. It is call the &quot;Don't Mess
With Texas&quot; card.  It has the Texas flag on the front, with the words
&quot;Don't Mess With Texas&quot; and the star in the blue field is in the shape
of the state, rather than a star.  10% of all purchases I make with the
card go to the Texas highway cleanup campaign.

Cheers,

 Hey all, I have heard that if you have a visa card issued through Rocky
Mountain Motorworks, that you get a 20% discount when ordering from
their catalog with their card.
As I can't seem to get through any of the 1-800 numbers, I was wondering
if anyone out there could confirm or disprive this theory. It would be
nice...
Thanks
