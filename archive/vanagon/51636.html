My 87 Vanagon GL has the same 'feature'.  If I let the pump go until the
automatic cut-off, I ALWAYS have fuel spitted back out.  It's been that
way since I bought it a year and a half ago.

ANYBODY OUT THERE, PLEASE POST TO THE LIST IF THIS IS NORMAL OR IF THIS
IS SOMETHING MORE SINISTER!

I've never worried about it, but some of the postings lately make me
wonder ... ... ...
