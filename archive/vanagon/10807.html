Subject: stripped cap-screws on the CVs...


	Sounds like a 20s movie...

	Friends,
	In spite of being deathly sick, I started working on my
single-cab to celebrate the sunny weather. I got one axle off OK and
went to the second- 2 cap screws on the inboard and 4 on the outboard
stripped when I tried to loosen them! 

	Seems to me that there are a several options for me:

	Dress-up inside of cap-screws with dremel tool so that a 7mm
inhex key fits 'em...

	Find an inch hex key just a bit bigger than 6mm- that would be
1/4 inch or so, see if that works, or try dressing the rouned insides
for 1/4 inch.

	Use Vice Grips. Maybe file or grind flats on the outside
of the inhex head.

	Saw a slot in the head and use a screw-driver to break
it free

	Drill a hole through the head and use a drill bit or other
hardened steel pin to turn the bolt.

	Use a propane torch to solder the 6mm hex key to each bolt
in turn...

	Weld or solder a nut on top of the cap screw to use as
a regular bolt head


	Obviously I'm going to have to clean all the crud around
them (did I mention that they are dirt and grease encrusted?)
and soak the threads with liquid wrench.

	Any suggestions will be appreciated. 

	Please cc me directly since I read the digest. I'll publicly
report and give credit for good ideas!
