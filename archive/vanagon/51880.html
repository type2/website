Subject: sighting-Rialto?

Hey, 

I saw the strangest thing in a campground today--maybe I'm just out of
it and everyone has discussed this a million times, but this was a
Rialto VW Camper...it was like one of those huge Winnebagos but
shrunken--

It's not like the Eurovan camper(although it obviously is a Eurovan)--no
poptop, just extended sides (big square chunks sticking out) as if it
has a bathroom and some other accomodations--it looked seriously laden!

I would never have thought it was a VW until I saw the emblem on the
front--I had a few double takes before I believed it!

I can't even think of how to explain it, except that of course the
owners snarled at me as I slowed to investigate...They were after all in
a campsite and what with me in a mere vanagon camper!

Does anyone have one of these?
