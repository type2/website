Subject: Re: Head gasket FIX!!!


..

&gt;Many cars today have engine compartments that have very bad air flow for
&gt;cooling. When the car is stoped and engine turned off Coolant and engine
&gt;temps can go up very high in a short time. Hey, sounds like Vanagon engine
&gt;compartments. What air flow?

&gt;VW has on water cooled cars put in either an afterrun fan thermo switch OR 
a
&gt;afterrun COOLANT PUMP and thermo switch (Many golf III's and all Eurovans
&gt;have this). MB also has this device on many cars. What it does is circulate
&gt;coolant thru the engine and radiator after the engine has shut off. This
&gt;keeps engine and coolant temps from sky rocketing after shut-off.

&gt;What would happen if vanagon waterboxers had such a system? Would the 
engine
&gt;stay cool after a hot run? Would the water jacket gasket stay cooler? Would
&gt;the heads stay cooler under the same conditions?

..

The Vanagon (sorry, have to say Transporter at this point) with Turbo
Diesel engines got this hot water pump from stock. This was standard
since the Turbos were built into Vanagons.

Later on this thread there is the idea to built in a thermostat for lower
coolant temperature. I can't agree to this. The engine needs a temperature
in a given range to run at it's optimum for fuel consumption. And a lower
water temp during operation doesn't help to keep the coolant temp down
AFTER the engine stops. Of cause, it will take a longer time to heat the
coolant up, but it will heat up. This is not a 100% solution.
