Subject: Re: Coolant disposal

&gt;Around here (Southern Calif) it is &quot;really really bad&quot;(tm) to pour anything
&gt;like anti-freeze down the drain, or on the ground.  Even the junkyards
&gt;have been forced by the state to provide pans to drain the stuff into in
&gt;the yards to protect the environment.  I always recycle it if it is
&gt;anything more than what gets spilled on the floor in the garage.

And I have had the same response from the folks that run the City of Atlanta
Water (and Sewer) department.  Also, rather extensive and humorous
discussions on NPR's &quot;Car Talk&quot; would indicate that disposing of Ethylene or
Propylene Glycol-based coolant is permissable in sewer systems.

I'm not sure that I would dispose of it in septic systems because of ground
water contamination.

What I have done is drain my coolant in front of the storm drain in front of
my house, diluted with lots of water from the garden hose, especially since
capturing all the coolant from a Vanagon (or any VW for that matter) is
difficult because of the conspicuous lack of petcocks in VW products.  Since
the City of Atlanta runs a CSO System (meaning the storm water combines with
raw sewage creating an overflow situation when it rains and dumping the
combined amount DIRECTLY into the Chattahoochee River) I would not do this
after a rain.
