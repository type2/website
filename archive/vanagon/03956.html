Subject: Awning

Following is my response to those who have requested information about my
awning purchase. It is a copy of the letter I wrote ordering the awning. I
paid full retail price for this, which none of you should do, so I think you
can get about 30% off by shopping around. I have files with information about
discount vendors of A&amp;E awnings but am too busy to dig them out (without a
bribe of some sort.) A&amp;E is sort of like the General Motors of the awning
business. I doubt any of you will buy anthing but just the awning and the van
adaptor kit for Vanagon as the screen room is very expensive.
