Subject: Re: [f] Excerpt from Car Talk about our rides ;-)

Because it's an [f] posting I won't bother quoting.

I've seen that article before. And I always wondered why people choose to 
pick on my cars.  I think the '63 Dodge Dart is a good car, and so is my 
microbus.  And I'd love to get a Corvair.
