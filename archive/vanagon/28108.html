Yes, this thing broke on me.  I couldn't believe VW was stupid enough to 
make the thing out of plastic.

&gt; I came across a reference in the archives to a cooling system flange problem
&gt; and want to flag this to (at least) 86 vanagon owners...and probably several
&gt; later years.  On the 86, a cooling hose enters the engine block under the
&gt; alternator through a plastic flange. (See Bentley p19.14--lower right of the
&gt; diagram with the 20 Nm designation.) This flange easily snaps off if any of
&gt; the drive belts break.  VW apparently discovered this problem and has a
&gt; replacemnt flange 025 121 160D made from steel which apparently solves the
&gt; problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; As best I can tell from Bentley the equivalent to this part on the 1983-85
&gt; models was made of metal.  My Bentley does not go past 1986, but I assume VW
&gt; changed to the metal replacement sometime after 1986.  I recommend (from
&gt; painful experience five years ago) that you check to see if you have the
&gt; plastic or metal version.  If you have the plastic version, order the metal
&gt; replacement (about $10 with new o ring as I remember) and at least carry it
&gt; with you until your next coolant change when it can be easily installed.
&gt; 
&gt; I was extremely fortunate that mine broke while in the St Louis region and
&gt; that one (of the then half dozen dealers in the metro area) actually had the
&gt; replacement part in stock.  You clearly risk major engine damage driving
&gt; with this part of the cooling system not functioning.
