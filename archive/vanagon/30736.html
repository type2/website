Mark,

I bought a bottle of Rain X anti-fog treatment and it seems to work ok.  
I've used the Rain X that goes on the outside of the windshield, and 
noticed that it needs reapplication about once a week to remain 
effective. 

Anyone out there used it before?  Also, any tips on aftermarket fans for 
busses?  I am considering putting one in, and would appreciate anyone 
else's advice.
