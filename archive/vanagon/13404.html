Subject: Exhaust Noise...Valves?
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 95 14:00:28 PST

Help Me Oh Mighty List!

Was doing the valves on the old '72 and now I have a distinct
  PUTT PUTT PUTT...
Rolled into a gas station and a young fellow (another bus owner) said
 &quot;sounds like you need to do your valves, man&quot;
I had set the valves to .006 (as per St. Muir). This always worked
 on the Bugs....Is there something about the Bus that I do not know?
Are the valves too loose? Too tight? Should they be set at .004?

Curious minds (and valves) want to know!
