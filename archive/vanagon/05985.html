So William Abbott says:

&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Norman Leong&quot; &lt;norman_leong_at_synoptics_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On 10/31/94, Martha wishes to classify herself:
&gt; &gt; &gt;flannel, WEST CALIFORNIA, air head (oops, I mean cooled)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Would this be the part of CA that falls into the Pacific and makes
&gt; &gt; Steven and Thom instant millionaires by making their homes beachfront
&gt; &gt; property with the next BIG ONE?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Norman, Norman,
&gt; 	The WESTERN part of the San Andreas Fault is moving NORTH and
&gt; RISING. We'll be in Seattle soon, where Martha's flannel shirts are
&gt; the height of fashon!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bill
&gt; 
&gt; 

Either way it makes ~Sacramento beach front property. Cmon' So. Cal!
Push Harder!  ;)
