Subject: Taller tranny for Vanagon (was: a snowy day)


&gt;Have you checked into changine the ring and pinion?  You may be able
&gt;to alter your final drive ratio.  Just bring buckets of $$$.  ;-)


Yup. Most companies such as Transform, install existing ring&amp;pinion
combinations from other trannies or sources that have lower ratios. Some
Vanagon trannies from Europe have slightly lower ratios, and these R&amp;Ps
can be transplanted. But the change in final ratio is very slight (0.82 vs. 
0.85,
for example). Only if you somehow custom-fabricate your own R&amp;P, or have
a shop do it (anyone know of a shop that will, or even can, do this?), can 
you
get a ratio lower than this.

On a related note: Don't most Porsche sports cars have 5-speed 
transmissions?
Anyone know what ratios these use? What direction do they turn (aren't some
Porsches mid-engine designs, with the transmission &quot;backward&quot; from the
VWs we are familiar with)? Are they strengthened for racing, and thus maybe
capable of handling the extra loadsa Vanagon will impose, especially with
a larger non-VW engine?
