My apologies to the rest of the list, a direct reply bounced with &quot;illegal
address&quot;, but then again this probably applies to all FI bus owners.

======================


Lisa - if your fuel pump relay is flakey, then, in my experience in a very
similar BOSCH setup in BMWs, your vehicle's &quot;main&quot; relay probably is not too
far behind with similar behavior (in fact, it may be the culprit and not your
fuel relay - also another possibility is a worn contact on your ignition
switch between the start and run positions).  Because (at least in my BMW) the
main relay is unique and cannot be &quot;swapped&quot; with another same p/n relay used
elsewhere in the car, if the main relay goes, you are stuck /DIW  [Dead In the
Water].  (In my car, the fuel pump relay is NOT unique and can be swapped for
the same p/n in some other circuit.)

These relays are relatively inexpensive and can be changed  easily (if you can
find where they are).  I strongly recommend that you change both at this time.
 I also carry spare relays for those two circuits, &quot;just in case&quot;.  Don't ask
how I know and how long/many times . . . .:-(  .
