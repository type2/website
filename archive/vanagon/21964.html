Subject: RE: Oversize Tires for Syncro Westies 


I've just put a set of these tires on my '90 (non-syncro). Specifically, 
they are BFG Triguard Sidewall radial TAs, aka &quot;Baja Commanders&quot;, 27 x 8.5 
14 LTs. The effects are just as described in your post: 1&quot; increase in 
clearance, slight decrease in acceleration. They have a fairly knobby tread 
pattern and incredibly still side walls. The tread makes a bit of noise, but 
not bad, and the stiff side walls make it corner much better. 

I'm not sure I'd recommend these for vehicles that never leave the smooth 
pavement. You can probably get other tires with side walls nearly as stiff, 
but that don't bring the accel. penalty. For me, though, these tires are 
just what I've been looking for. About two weeks ago I drove the van down 
into Mexico for a 4 day surf trip (as I've done many times before) and as 
usual had to baby it over the typically torn up pavement of the main Baja 
highway, and it only gets worse when you turn off the pavement and head out 
to the beaches. I know, what I _really_ need is a syncro, but I ain't got 
one, so the trusty Wolfsburg edition gets pushed to and beyond its limits. 
The extra clearance and general sturdiness of the 27 x 8.5s is s big help. 
Can't wait till the next chance to see how they work in Baja (The big 
October List trip??).

While I'm on this thread, does anyone know of aftermarket coil springs that 
would fit a later-model vanagon, to give a stiffer ride and maybe even more 
clearance? I've looked into this with local (San Diego) FLAPS and suspension 
shops, sith no luck. While the factory lowering job VW did to vanagons 
starting in '88 does give 'em better road manners, it also makes 'em more 
vulnerable to damage from uneven surfaces. If I'm not mistaken, the later 
models also have generally softer suspension. The '84 I had previously 
seemed much more 'truck-like', not only higher off the ground but with 
tougher suspension. Maybe I can get some coil springs made for an early 
model and put them on the '90?? Could life possible be that simple?
