Subject: CV joint bolts...clunk clunk

Help! My '82 diesel Vanagon has had a re-occurring problem--twice in 
four months.  The bolts on only one of the four CV joints loosen and if 
given a chance will pop out and _hoo-boy_.  The threads are worn but 
not completely wiped.

What is the best repair? What is the easiest? What is the least costly? 
Or any combination.

Thank you for your support,
Steven Sr. in Derby
