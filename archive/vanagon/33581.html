Subject: New Catalog

I just got a new catalog in the mail.  (Can't remember if I sent away for it,
must have).  Anyway, it is geared towards campers, as in mobile homes.  Lot
of neat stuff for our application, somewhat pricey.  It even has Martha's
Kool Seal for sale.

The info is:
Camping World
Three Springs Road
PO Box 90017
Bowling Green, KY  42102
800-626-5944
