Subject: Re: Heater Panel Removal Help 84 Westy

&gt;Can anyone tell me the secret to removing the large plastic heater vent panel
&gt;? It is the large (snap? on) one in the middle of the dash with the heater
&gt;vent openings. Bentley calls it a heater directional panel. It seems as if it
&gt;should pop off and I see no screws that hold it in place. I think this is the
&gt;panel Joel Walker has attached numerous cup holders to. Thanks.

It should slide straight out (horizontally) 
there are 2 plastic &quot;tracks&quot; it is held in with, no screws. 
grasp at both sides, and with plenty of swearing, it should come out. 
sometimes the top of it gets caught behind the bottom part of the metal dash,
and you'll have to pull it down, the same time as you're pulling it out, if that
happens.

Remember, it is plastic, and if forced in cold weather, it will break.
