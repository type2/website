&gt; Subject: Re: Metric Cubic Measurements of '84 Westy
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I've been quoted $60 US per cubic metre to transport an '84 Westy by
&gt; &gt;freighter. This week,  I'm separated from both my Westy and my Bentley
&gt; &gt;manual. Can anyone figure the dimension of a Westy from the bottom of
the
&gt; &gt;tires to the top of the camper top?
&gt; 
&gt; 80 inches or just over 2meters (2.010).  Now you've got me interested,
this is
&gt; a pretty cheap price, shipping from where to where? Overseas??  Shipped
one
&gt; from Halifax NS to France for about the same price, but that was in 1980.
 No
&gt; inflation?
&gt;

Dan Syncrohead calculated the metric volume of the Westy at 17.25.

The freighter shipment (vehicle, only) is from Colon, Panama to Cartegena,
Colombia to avoid an approximate 100 kilometer overland trek through the
Darien Gap, the last unimproved link on the Interamerican Highway, AKA the
Pan American Highway. 

The terrain is passable to 4-wheel drive vehicles in arduous journeys.  My
2WD '84 Westy, my wife, two Dachshunds and I choose not to replicate the
exploits of a unit of British Marines who dismantled their Land Rover and
carried it overland in what may be an apocryphal story.  Much is written
about adventure travel over this route, 4-wheel drive convoy sagas,
impassable in rainy season, bandits, etc.

The recent closure of the Crucero Express between Colon and Cartegena with
its costs of $130.00 per vehicle and $50  per person, including cabin, puts
a new financial perspective on the journey.  The new tariff, including
airfare at $200 per person, one way, and the shipping of the vehicle at $1,
030, one way, hikes a $460 item to $2,460, at a minimum. Then there are
port fees, the costs and extras of the binational flight etc.

We're now looking at other ports of embarkation such as freighter to
Venezuela.  Has anybody shipped or accompanied a Westy to South America by
any other routes or means of transportation?
