Sorrry if this is obvious..but take along some basic spares - I always carry
coil, dist cap, rotor arm, capacitor, plug lead and cap, points, fuses,
accelerator cable, clutch cable...simple little annoyances that are a pain if
you dont have them and easy to fix....more major stuff means bigger
problem....
I'd also grease gun everything before going ...and depending on last change
time either top up /check or change transmission oil and after 1500 miles

Mind you we still have had to be pushed onto the ferry and trailered home from
France twice in the past four years......once cos I forgot a spare rotor arm
(and could not easy get another) and once cos the oil seals blew...
Oh well......have a good trip
Dave
