&gt;PROPANE HEATER:
&gt;The heater is a =F4PROPEX COMPACT 1600=F6 it measures a mere 14 inches lon=
g,
&gt;6inches wide and 4.5 inches deep.

I love this kind of heaters. I bought my one four years ago and it keeps my=
 =
feet
warm. But I got it from another vendor, Truma, on a higher price :-(

If you like to have a Sauna inside your Vanagon, it is available in three =
different
versions:

        Trumatic ED 1800  Trumatic ED 2800   Trumatic ED 4000
        1.9 kW            2.85 kW            4.15 kW
Gas     75-150 g/h        100-210 g/h        150-310 g/h
Air fl. 56-100 m^3/h      70-140 m^3/h       100-185 m^3/h
Electr. 12 V              12 V               12 V
Electr. 0.6-1.1 A         0.55-1.0 A         0.75-1.7 A

All this heaters are mountable in every direction. I mounted the ED 1800
inside the dent in front of the left rear wheel behind the inner panel, in
the case of the Camper behind the gas bottle.
