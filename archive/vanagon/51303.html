Is it best to only let a VW 'specialist' work on your Bus (1982 Vanagon) or
are things so straightforward that an experienced non-specific mechanic
will be fine? Obviously all things being equal you would prefer the
specialist but what if you had to travel a long distance and pay twice the
hourly rate? I am talking about not only the annual service but also fault
finding and things like clutch, steering/suspension stuff, starting stuff
etc.
