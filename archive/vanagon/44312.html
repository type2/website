Subject: EV A/C Preventative Maint.


Before I left for France, I dropped the EV off to have the dealer check out 
the A/C. When I got home, they said: &quot;It just needed a recharge...no leaks&quot;.

Ok, I figured I dodged a bullet...

Tuesday afternoon the A/C started blowing non-cooled air, so I called the 
dealer told them I had the same problem...they said bring it in on Thursday.

Last night I decided to do some snooping, and came across the problem, and 
hopefully save you EVers some grief.

My problem was with the pressure relief valve located on the receiver/dryer 
(the silver looking beer canned sized piece) located in the right front 
wheel well. It also happens to be located right directly in front of the 
tire.

Now VW has decided to shield the horn from debris but not this piece. 
Aparently the pressure relief valve took a couple of hits over the year from 
tire/road debris and decided to quit....

Now my parts book for the EV lists the pressure valve as a separate piece 
from the receiver/dryer....however VWUS sells the whole assy...for $220...or 
at my discount price $170....

I called a local A/C repair shop, they said bring the valve down....I took 
the valve off....brought it down to the A/C shop. They matched it up with a 
used one. Gave it to me, no charge...

Anyway, now to the preventative maintanance....

Next time you refill your windshield washer (what the hell does THIS have to 
do with A/C???) resivoir, save the windshield washer container. Crawl under 
the right front wheel well and make a plastic debris shield for your 
reciever/dryer and pressure relief valve. Hint...you can hold the whole 
thing in place using the same clamp that holds the receiver dryer in place!!

Total cost $0.00....money saved  $225+.


Oh yeah...the VW dealer recharged the system and pressure checked it (again) 
for no charge....
