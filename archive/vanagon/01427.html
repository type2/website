 Hi,

&gt; 	The front end on my 1977 Bus sits way too high. I've been
&gt; scanning through Muirs book, but have yet to run across the cause or
&gt; solution. A hint will earn you twelve Karma points :-).

 I would guess the back is low, rather than the front high. To fix it you'd
need to adjust or replace the rear torsion bars. It's probably not worth it.

 If you want a balanced look you could always lower the front. Best way seems
to be to get a sway-a-way front end which I understand changes the position
of the stops for the torsion bars.

Cheers,
        W.
