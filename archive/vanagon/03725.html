Subject: Gas leaking from filler tube - '90 Vanagon
Date: Fri, 02 Sep 1994 09:51:20 -0700
From: Edward Wilson &lt;ed_at_sun-valley&gt;


I remember seeing some discussion about this earlier, but ignored it
because I have no such problem with my '81.  Since then, my dad has
bought a '90 (both Westfalias), and just recently asked me about this
problem.

He said he filled it up until the pump shut off.  Put in $.30 more gas
to round it off, and went to pay for the gas.  When he got back to the
bus, he noticed a puddle of gas on the ground, and could see some gas
dripping behind him as he drove away.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

       Ed Wilson
