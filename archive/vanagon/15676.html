Subject: 71 rebuild

Thanks for all the advice on engine rebuilders and good local people who will
also rebuild.  My wife and I sat down and decided to do the rebuild together.
We bought the bus to do a major conversion to.  so in respect for the bus we
will rebuild.
after much reading we decided to drop the engine today, but got 4 inches of
snow. I think we will wait a few days longer.  My question is ?  I am looking
for info on how an extra external oil cooler works  I know it is drilled into
the case, but do i need a larger oil pump to push this extra oil through this
new filter and cooler or is just drill and connect.  Nothing can be this
easy. any help.   We will keep you posted as our journey continues.
