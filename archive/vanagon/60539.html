Subject: flashing temp. light ?????

Anyone had this happen and can you tell me what you think.
My vehicle; 1991 Vanagon GL, 120,000 miles, new heads 15k ago.

I drove the 700 mile drive to visit Mom and Dad in Upper Michigan for their
50th anniversary, coolant in overflow tank was at minimum level when I left
Buffalo.  While home I had the local VW dealer (one of the few I trust) do
a 30k service.  I noticed the next morning the overflow tank was dry so  I
filled the tank to the max. level and headed back to Buffalo.  After 600
miles on the Interstates (70-75mph), the temperature light started flashing
but the temp. needle stayed OK.  When I got in slow traffic or stopped at a
light the needle would start to go up.  The radiator fan was NOT coming on.
I made it home the last 100 miles like this, keeping the heat on full to
keep the temperature down.  The light flashed the whole time.  Today, the
day after this drive, everything seems fine.  The light isn't flashing, the
radiator fan IS coming on, but the temp. gauge is reading slightly higher
than it normally does.  The coolant in the overflow tank is also now down
to the minimum level.

Any advice appreciated.  The kids still plan on driving it to the West
coast and back, leaving in two weeks.
