&gt;I just got a factory rebuilt engine put back in my 91 Carat by the dealer and
&gt;noticed that the rpms are about 3000-3500 with the pedal to the floor.
&gt;Occasionally it will burst up to 4000-5000 , giving a sudden burst of power,
&gt;but then goes back doen to 3-4krpms..losing that burst of power...is this
&gt;normal for rebuilts?...my original engine would stay at a high rpm when i
&gt; floored it, until i would let up on the gas.....

uhhhhhhhh ... you might not want to be floor-boarding the rebuilt. it should
be treated just like a brand-new engine, and lots of folks say it should be
somewhat 'babied' for about 1000 miles or so. but do vary the speed on the
highway (don't sit on cruise control at 55) ... it supposedly helps seat the
rings and such.  but it shouldn't be bursting like that. that sounds more
like something electrical or air-related not being hooked up right. ??

&gt;On another note When I depress the brake pedal I notice a vibration comming
&gt;from the left front wheel....could it be that the rotors are uneven?? or
&gt;does it mean I need an allignment......I a set of after market rotors put on
&gt;last MAY, and was experiencing the problem before my engine rebuild....

it could be an uneven rotor. but it should give a 'pulsing' sensation, not
just a vibration. depending on the miles on the car, you could have a worn
rotor (depends on the quality of those  'aftermarket' ones) or just a worn
brake pad that is vibrating (cause it's not pressed hard against the rotor).
you need to check it out, though.
