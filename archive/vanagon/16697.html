Subject: Manassas BugOut

For anybody who is interested in going to the Bugout over Memorial Day
weekend. I have been going for the last 10? years and stay at Bull Run 
regional park (703) 631-0550. My campsite is the one with the big 
&quot;Fahrvergnugen&quot; sign. You can't miss it. Anybody is welcome to stop by to
chat , have a brew or whatever.
