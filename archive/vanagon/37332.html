Subject: Re: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus


&gt;&gt; You guys aren't by chance refering to the wash function, are you?  I know
&gt;that
&gt;&gt; on later busses the hose from the windshield washer tank runs up to a 
valve
&gt;&gt; on the column and from there to the jets on the windshield.  If the 
washer
&gt;&gt; tank wasn't pressurized, then moving the lever wouldn't appear to do
&gt;anything.
&gt;&gt; But I can't remember if this is the same lever as for the wipers, or a
&gt;&gt; different stalk.
&gt;
&gt;It's the same lever, but you get the wash function by pulling up on the 
lever,
&gt;towards your face.  :)  My four-position wiper doesn't do anything in
&gt;the down position either.


On the '80 V6anagon, the &quot;down&quot; position (toward your belt buckle, not
toward your face) is the &quot;intermittent&quot; setting-- the wipers sweep maybe
once every 10 seconds or so. It even works!

Except... when the engine is first started, and the wonderful Chevy
alternator hasn't decided to join the party, the alternator light is
still on, and the system voltage is around 11.5 volts... the intermittent
position sweeps once and then remains silent forever after... until the
alternator finally starts alternating and brings the voltage up to 13.8V
or so. Then &quot;intermittent&quot; works fine.

Makes perfect sense to me.   :-\
