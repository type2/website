I think the concern is that in the event of an accident, there is a much
greater chance of an explosion if you have propane flowing through an open
line.

If the valve on the tank is closed, the tank must be hit pretty square on
for a rupture to occur (you'd basically have to bust open the tank or smash
the valve off).

With the valve open, it is concievable that even a fairly minor crash could
jostle/crumple things enough to rupture a thin little propane line, causing
gas to spew forth into or around the vehicle.

There is an answer to this whole debate however - get an automatic shutoff
valve (which I believe is what most big RVs have).

To quote an earlier post on the subject:

Camping World, that bastion of the one-piece jumpsuit, has such a
device that limits LP gas flow to 10 SCFH in the event of a hose
rupture, loose fitting, or regulator housing failure.  it be $24.75.
