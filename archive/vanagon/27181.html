Subject: Grendel's nose



Two days ago a friend and I took the posey off Grendel's nose.  Used a little
paint remover and a lot of scraping, took it right down to the metal.  

In places, Grendel's nose was clotted with eight layers of paint, plus lots
of bondo.  In the bare metal we could read her history of front-end
collisions:  At least three.  A previous owner had mounted her spare on her
nose.  One of her collisions had impressed the shape of the tire into the
sheet metal.  The crash tore out the too-small mounting clips used for the
spare tire carrier.  So they tried again, drilling three new holes,
installing the carrier up-side down, then promptly went out and got into
another wreck.

Of of the above collisions or possibly a different one, saw Grendel impact
something about knee-high having square steel corners like the back of a
truck or perhaps a loading dock.  The impact tore the front bumper loose from
its bracket, folding the bumper and over-riders into Grendel's nose with
enough force for the bumper guard to punch a neat hole in the sheet metal,
drawing the driver's side headlight fixture down and toward the centerline.

There was bondo under the collision damage, meaning Grendel had been bumped
before.  And up near the right turn signal, down under the original factor
primer, a neat little ding about the size of a pea had been smoothed with
filler -- Volkswagen's own work.  Unfortunately, the filler had been applied
atop rust and the neat little ding was now a dismal crater of corrosion.

I'm considering three options.  The first and most practical is surgery; to
cut off Grendel's nose and replace it.  I have to repair rust damage at the
base of the door pillars , and the rusted-out cockpit floor must be replaced
with mill panels, so I might as well make a job of it and do the nose clip as
well.  

A second option is to ding out the nose enough to repair the crushed heater
duct.  One of the collisions drove the nose skin into the vertical duct,
collapsing it onto the control valve so that the valve rattles around and
heated air spews from all four outlets whenever the heater is heating.  But
I'm not a very good sheet metal dinger, the repair might look worse than it
does now although it would allow the heater to work better.

The third option is to do nothing at all, at least not to the nose skin.
 Repair the structural damage but leave the cosmetics for another time.
 Right now, it's the option most attractive to me.  

I've already ordered new seals for the windscreens and front doors (they're
available from J. C. Whitney).  I don't have an inexpensive source of
side-window rubber and since all of the windows are leaking but only two have
hardware I'll probably pull them, clean up the openings and close them with
metal plates until I can afford to rebuild the windows.  That will make
Grendel weather-tight which is my immediate goal.

Without having to worry about Grendel's nose I can focus my attention on her
butt, which is banged up even worse.  There is up to half an inch of bondo in
some places, revealed when subsequent collisions shattered the bondo. The
engine compartment lacks hinges and seals and the rear body panel is dented
all to hell, presently mounted with bailing wire.  The lack of a seal around
the floppy fitting hatch causes Grendel to suck in a lot of her own exhaust
and heated cooling air, a bad combination for both her and her passengers.
 But this repair is going to call for some heavy-weight body work since it
extends as far forward as the gas tank and involves the stub-frame on the
left side.

Then there is the problem of the damaged shifter rod.  At Shelton I got it to
work by pounding it straight then filing off the burrs with Swiss files while
laying under the vehicle, hammering a junkyard coupler onto the roughly
dressed rod-end after bathing it with JB Weld.  It held up for the trip home
and could very well last for years.  But it is broken and must be replaced.
 Of course, to pull the shifter-rod means pulling  the tranny, which calls
for removing the engine.

Any time you pull the tranny from an early bus the vehicle becomes
immobilized since the wheels go with the tranny.  And with all that pulled
you may just as well go ahead and replace the torsion tube bushings and
overhaul the spring plates.  And of course, the bus must be supported well
above the ground to get at the tranny and axles and since want to keep things
level that means jack-stands under the front-end as well.  Might as well take
care of those junkyard spindles.

And to think all this started by removing the flower from her nose :-)
