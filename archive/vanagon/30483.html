Subject:      eurovan/winnebago ... on sale! :)

well, i stopped by Burton Campers in Calera, AL, and looked the '95 Rialta.
BIG inside. pretty impressive amount of room.

anyway, the guy said they were discounting it, so here's the deal:

1995 VW/Winnebago Rialta.
list: $45,000        new asking price:  $41,500
has A/C, generator, microwave, propane stove &amp; propane furnace/heater,
shower &amp; toilet, and is wired for television (? that's what he said).

if interested, it's at
Burton Campers  1-800-226-1822;  (205) 668-0075; fax (205) 668-0142
320 Hwy 304     &lt;Interstate 65, exit 231; right at the exit&gt;
Calera, AL 35040
salesman is Perry Lauderdale, (205) 688-2723 (home)

for those who can't read maps :) it's about 30 miles south of Birmingham, AL,
on I-65. get off at the 231 exit, cross back over the interstate, and take
the first road back to your right (after you get pass the interstate). you
can see the place very easily from the overpass.

no recommendations of the place (never bought anything there; but they've
been nice enough to tolerate my snooping around the place several times! :)
no relatives working there; all other standard disclaimers apply. :)
