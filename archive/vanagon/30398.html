&gt;Just drove my '85 GL from Atlanta to Durham this afternoon--no problems
&gt;until I got off the freeway.  The cooling led light came on, but the
&gt;temperature gauge never registered hot--and the cooling fan has not come on.
&gt;The fill tank for the coolant is completely full now, far above the &quot;min&quot;
&gt;mark--it was a little below &quot;min&quot; when I left this morning.
&gt;
&gt;I will be at this address until noon on Saturday if anyone has any
&gt;suggestions--particularly Triangle area Vanagon people!

The &quot;cooling led light&quot; is connected to a level sensor in the primary coolant
tank.  If you remove the engine cover, this is the tank on your left, and has
a cap on it with a hose leading to the refill tank.  The refill tank is the
one that you can see through the license plate opening.  The LED indicates
that you have a low coolant level in the primary tank. Once the sensor sees a
low coolant condition, a latching circuit keeps the LED on even if the
coolant goes back up again.  You'll often notice the first indication of a
low coolant while rounding a corner or going over a bump, due to the coolant
sloshing away from the sensor.  The LED latching circuit is reset when you
turn of the van.  

You probably don't have a significant problem.  I'd just add coolant to the
primary tank until it's full and keep an eye out for signs of a coolant leak.
