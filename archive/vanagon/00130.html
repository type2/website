&gt; &gt; I was requested to post this so here goes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I met a couple in the Cameron Park (CA) that had a '91 Syncro.  They
&gt; &gt; showed me a neat propane heater setup they had.  The heater is made
&gt; &gt; and sold only in Germany.  The heater is about the size of a large
&gt; &gt; thermos and is mounted under the bench seat.  It has two small vacuum
&gt; &gt; cleaner type hoses that are used to route the air for circulation.
&gt; &gt; The way they had it was just routed to the panel at the front of the
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I live near San Jose, California, and own a 1985 Westphalia. I've had a 
&gt; great little propane heater installed on the door of the refrigerator for 
&gt; about three years. I believe it's made by Olympian. Their available 
&gt; through various RV dealers. I had mine tuned up at a factory rep. in 
&gt; Napa, Calif. as I recall. Reliable. The larger of the two models provides 
&gt; abundant heat even in subzero weather at Lake Tahoe.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the price was about $400, and the install was about $250.

James,

Can you get a phone number and address of the manufacturer?  I'd like
more info.

Thanks,

Steven
