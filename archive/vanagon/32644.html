Subject: water pump recommendation wanted

The water pump on my '87 wasserboxer is failing--leaking around the shaft
seal. It's only 1 year old and has only 9000 miles on it (replaced by PO).
Looks to be a remanufactured part. Who makes the best replacement pump? Is
replacement a pretty straight-forward job?
