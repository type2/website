Subject:      Re: Vanagon books

Hi Ivan,

&gt; Without much luck, I've been looking for a supplier for two vanagon books
&gt; that I've heard about.  They are:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The Pocket Mechanic, Volkswagen Transporter 1.9 and 2.1 Liter Water
&gt; Cooled From 1985&quot; by Peter Russek Publications, Ltd out of England

This is available from Brookland. I have a fax from them listing the book
but never got around to ordering it. I'll see if I can find it and fwd it
to you.

&gt;
&gt; and
&gt;
&gt; VW Bus Custom Handbook by Laurence Meredith, from The Red House, ISBN
&gt; 1-870979-47-8 by Richard Kurtz

can't help you there. Unca Joel????

good luck!
