Subject: Re: Propane Setup

     Clay,
     
     Just got thru reading your post on this subject on the vanagon list.  
     
     What you should consider is running appropriate tubing to an access 
     point (wherever is most convenient and appropriate) on the perimeter 
     of you van.  Install a &quot;quick disconnect&quot; female fitting on your 
     propane tubing at that point.  
     
     Then get a regulator with LH propane tank fitting, a flex hose of 
     appropriate length, and a male &quot;quick disconnect&quot; fitting.  Install 
     them on your large propane tank, set the tank beside the van, and 
     (literally) plug the large tank into your van's system, open the tank 
     valve, and enjoy.  
     
     This doesn't prevent you from installing and using an 0n-board propane 
     tank. If you install the quick disconnect fitting properly, and if you 
     set the large tank regulator a trifle higher than the on-board tank 
     regulator, the large tank will empty itself first, followed by the 
     on-board (reserve) tank.  Not a bad idea if you think about it.  When 
     you are camping, and the large tank empties out, you will still have a 
     propane supply while you go to town to fill the big bottle.     
     
     Some tips - 
     
     1)  There are several types or &quot;weights&quot; of copper tubing.  You want 
     the heavy duty flexible kind.  You don't want rigid tubing and you 
     don't want the light duty refrigerator tubing.  As I recall, the type 
     you want is &quot;Type K.&quot;
     
     2)  You should use flared fittings on your propane system.  You 
     absolutely DO NOT want to use compression type fittings (known as 
     Swedgelok and by several other trade names).  The compression type 
     fittings have two nasty habits, in my experience:  1) they tend to 
     come loose in situations where there is vibration (like on a vehicle)  
     and 2) it is very easy to overtighten compression fittings - this 
     creates a high stress point in the vicinity of the ferrule, which will 
     later crack or break.  You will have to buy or borrow a flaring tool - 
     which won't be too expensive  - and working with flared fittings takes 
     a little more pre-planning and a little patience.  Save the 
     compression type fittings for water, compressed air, and other less 
     dangerous fluids.  
     
     3) Make sure you use a good brand of liquid (or semi-liquid) pipe dope 
     on all threaded fittings.  For some reason the teflon tape doesn't 
     work well with propane, natural gas, or similar stuff.    
     
     4) Try to plan your propane system so that ALL fittings are 
     accessible.  This may require some creative tubing bending and a lot 
     of prior planning.  But it's worth it.  You sure as heck don't want a 
     leak to develop behind some cabinets where you may not detect it right 
     away or where you may not be able to get to it to fix it without 
     tearing your whole interior apart.  
     
     In most of the systems I've worked on, we ran the main line around 
     underneath the vehicle - thru the frame - installed tee's where 
     appropriate and ran uninterrupted sections of tubing up to each 
     appliance.  If you do this, make sure to avoid potential pinch points, 
     contact with exhaust sytem, moving parts, places frequently hit by 
     thrown up gravel, etc.
     
     5) Install a shut off cock at each appliance. 
     
     6) Pressure up your newly-installed system and go over every inch of 
     it with soapy water to make sure there are no leaks - especially 
     before you conceal any of it behind cabinets, etc.  You should follow 
     up by checking parts you can reach - esp. fittings - again at least 
     once a year - preferably every time you use the system after you 
     haven't used it for a while.  Get a laboratory squirt bottle - use a 
     couple of tablespoons of diswashing liquid per pint of water (more or 
     less  -  not a magic formula or anything).  With the soapy water, even 
     small leaks will be obvious - bubbles everywhere!   
     
     7)  As a matter of convenience, think about providing a &quot;quick 
     disconnect&quot; fitting on the side of your van so you can hook up 
     appliances with flex hoses to work outside.  There is definitely 
     cooking you won't want to do inside the van -  anything that is really 
     greasy and anything (like cooking spaghetti) that will put a lot of 
     water vapor in the air.  You haven't lived until you get rained on 
     inside your canper when it gets cold enough at night to condense the 
     water vapor on the ceiling.  I installed a convenience propane outlet 
     on the side of a popup camper trailer I had a few years ago.  It was 
     set up so that I could run the stove outside or use an outside propane 
     lantern.  Nifty!
