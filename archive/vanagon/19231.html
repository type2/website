Well, since it's Friday maybe I can prove I'm not an uptight jerk after all 
and tell you folks something amusing...

This sounds like a perfect straight line to introduce 

	MICROWAVE GRAPE RACING!

Take a plate or other dish with a smooth surface, put a little film of 
vegetable oil on it for lubrication.  mark parallel lines for start and 
finish. Put it in the microwave. 

Each drive chooses a grape and places it on the starting line, with the hole 
where the stem was pointing *away* from the finish.

Clsoe the door and nuke the grapes for a few minutes.  As the grape juice 
begins to boil, a jet of steam will come out the stem-hole and you will have 
ROCKET PROPELLED GRAPES!

Loser buys the beer...
