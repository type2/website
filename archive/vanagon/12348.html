Subject: Engine Overheating Problem


Hi,

I'm new to the list so this might be an out of date, boring subject but
it's a real pain and i'd really appreciate other peoples opinions.

We own a '79 2.0 litre T4 panel van which runs a sweet as a nut apart from
it's overheating. It pulls well in all gears, accelerates well and doesn't
miss a beat. But whenever we pull up we have to put up with that worrying
'hot' smell we all dread!!!  

Wondered if anyone has any ideas as to what's up??


cheers in advance

N
