&gt; Hi folks;  this is a general inquiry for you sales inclined people.... &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any/seen Westy or Weekender furnishings for sale? I
wish to &gt; make my 7 seater into a home away from home. Will pay bottom
dollar or less, &gt; gifts accepted!  (sorry, no tax receipts) tim s. 

I found a wrecked '88 Weekender at a dismantler in Berkeley, Calif. three
years ago.  I bought the poptop and interior for $400.  That included the
cushion over the engine cover, closet/cupboard in back, full width back
seat, table, rear facing single seat, curtains, etc.  At that price, they
kept the front seats.  The front luggage rack/top was cracked, but I
thought I got a good deal.  They turn up in wrecking yards once in a
while, so keep looking!
