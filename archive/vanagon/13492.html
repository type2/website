Matthew &quot;I'd rather NOT walk&quot; Drahzal laments:

&gt;My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NUBus ('82 Diesel)


well, maTThew, howzabout this...

1) point out to &quot;The Recalcitrant One&quot; that you'll be his best bud in about
   2.5 yrs. or so, when he's thinkin' about gettin' his license.

2) point out that he can entertain many friends in the cozy confines of NuBus,
   despite its lack of alacrity, some of whom may be BBBBs.*
   *Big-Breasted, Blond (or Brunette, I suppose) Bimbos

3) launch an immediate search for a wrecked P-car 930 motor (maybe Ric can help)
   I know you just replaced the motor in NuBus, but I believe you made a 
   tactical error w/ The Recalcitrant One when you opted of the same type of
   motor instead of a raging hormones motor.  Gotta keep in mind, he's under
   a lot of peer pressure!

4) Rebadge NuBus...make it a...MB TD bus, yeah, that's it, that's the ticket!

5) let him walk, the exercise'll do him good.


Norman&quot;I'll be in the same boat in 11 yrs. myself&quot;Leong
