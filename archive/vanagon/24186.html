Subject: more bug o rama - BUSGIRL
Date: Tue, 05 Sep 95 10:56:43 PDT
From: Mitch Hendrickson &lt;mitchh_at_hops.gvg.TEK.COM&gt;


My sweetie and I managed to make it down to the Bug O Rama as well,
later in the day.  Looked like a lot of the good swap stuff was gone,
but picked up a couple things, including the ever-so-elusive '71 bus
air cleaner. 

Anyway, there was a split bus with &quot;BUSGIRL&quot; plates.  Did a double
take, and then a doule check, to make sure Martha wasn't holding out
on us :-).  Nope, somebody else...
