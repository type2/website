So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm one of those silly people, and I maintain that it is better for my
&gt; engine to have the flaps removed.  They way they work is silly!  They 
&gt; direct air away from the oil cooler.  I took them out and my oil temp
&gt; dropped noticably.  The flaps do help the engine warm up faster, yes, but
&gt; IMO that is to protect against the &quot;silly people&quot; who get into their cars
&gt; and immediatly floor it and rev it to redline while it is still cold.  I
&gt; have had the cooling flaps out for a long time now, and have no regrets.

What you don't see and is really silly is that without the flaps your engine
is taking longer to warm up to operating temp. which is more wear and
tear on your engine.  Granted, you are in a mild temp. zone but still,
it adds up.  Anything greater or lesser than the optimum operating temp
is not good for the engine.
