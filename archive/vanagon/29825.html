After seeing a friend's 220D Benz with a fuel cell in the trunk
I wanted one too.  I thought that a good location would be under the rear 
seat/folding bed.  The only thing separating it from the stock fuel 
tank is sheet metal, so plumbing them together would be fairly simple.

That would put the fuel cell inside the cabin area and I have an uneasy 
feeling about doing that.  I store the westy tent poles and the camp
stove in that spot instead.
