Subject: Re: life w/ synthetic tranny fluid

&gt;I've had synthetic fluid in the tranny of the '87 now for about a 
&gt;month and thought i'd give a report.
&gt;
&gt;standard big-arse allen wrench.  I had to weld my nuts on (ouch) the
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ouch indeed!     
                                        
&gt;bolt to keep them from loosening, however.  this tip came after i 
&gt;used 2 hacksaw blades to unsuccessfully try to shorten my allen 
&gt;wrench (what DO they make those out of??).

They are case hardened if you bought good ones, which yours would be. Since 
you are 1/2 way through clamp the bigger portion in a good bench vise then 
covering your eyes, (and any other tender round orbs you possess) tee off on 
the little piece with a good hammer. It will break off cleanly. Neaten it up 
with a grinding wheel. I've done this with 6 and 8mm allen keys, 17mm!? Whew.

I asked the dealer here about synthetics for the tranny, and received a 
strong quick NO!. I've just changed mine to fresh dino juice Castrol 80/90W, 
shifting is &quot;a bit&quot; better. Maybe? I would have /wanted to put synth in, 
just can't get a clear feeling on this. There are many tales of great 
improvements in shifting on the Porsche list, no negative stories. The VW 
service manager indicated that synth was OK in the front diff of my Syncro, 
but not in the rear trans/diff &quot;it burns the bearings&quot; Since the Porsche 
boxes also are german, as are the bearings etc. why can't I use synth in 
VWs. Anyone with real info out there? I don't intend to change tranny oil 
too often, so the longterm price of synth is small. tim s.
