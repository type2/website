Subject: Re: Help with engine rebuild '87 [W] Vanagon

&gt;	I need some guidance on a problem with my recently purchased '87
&gt;camper Van. I was not very careful at getting the Van inspected before I
&gt;purchased it from a dealer in Santa Rosa, CA that deals exclusively with
&gt;VW camper vans. What I have discovered since January is that this van

I'm no legal expert, but my impression is that lemon laws do not apply to
used cars. Also I don't know how much you paid for this van, but if it's
excessive, you can always try to contact the Better Business Bureau.

I'm more confident about the following statement: $5000 for rebuilding the
engine is *way* too much and If I were you, I'd look for a more honest
mechanic.

There may be yet another alternative: resell this van and buy a nicer one.
There *are* nice ones out there, especially in CA. That's where I bought
my '75 camper 3 years ago. I paid $3000, which is on the high side for a bus
that old, but it was in great condition. So far, I have only had few and minor
problems with it. 

Unscrupulous mechanics, however, have been a bigger problem. The first
week I owned the bus, the red panic light went on: low oil pressure! The
next mechanic confirmed this (&quot;Yeah, I've been working on those suckers
for 40 years, and yup, you got low oil pressure, blabla&quot;) and offered to
replace the engine for a lot of money. Since I was broke, I decided to
wait and started to read Muir's compleat idiot book. Taught myself how to
check the oil pressure and checked it: Perfectly fine! The problem was
electrical.

Anyway, I'm diverging... Those were my 2 cents, you'll certainly get other
opinions from the list. Good luck!
