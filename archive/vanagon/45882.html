&gt;Hi Glen -
&gt;Your's is not the first request for this item, we've had a ton of 'em.  And
&gt;of course, every used one we've found as well has cracks forming on it as,
&gt;which would be expected after 15 to 24 years of use and exposure.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;BTW this hose fits 72-79's.

Jim, Glen,

&gt;From my experience in switching the '79 FI tank into the '73 non-FI body,
the filled neck *on the tank* is in the same place, but the filler on the
body changed between those years.  The '79 had the filler perpendicular to
and flush with the body, the '73 has the filler behind a door and vertical.
I don't think the same hose will fit both applications.  Also, as I said to
Glen in a private post previously, while I have not (yet) experienced this
cracking problem firsthand, I looked at my hoses with a previous series of
&quot;gas fume&quot; posts in mind, and decided that, if it became a problem for me
that I would try the following:

Remove filler tube and clean it;

Get a tube of the &quot;25-year&quot; silicon caulk and squeeze a big messy handfull
onto my hand;

Have someone hand me the tube;

Work that caulk all over the outer surface and into the cracks.

Has anyone else considered this?  Tried it?  Did it work?
