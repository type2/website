Subject: [F] Westy shown on news in snow


I was watching the evening news last nite and they have a section on
the weather we have been having here in California.

They show all the snow hitting the hiways to the Sierras, and lo and
behold a bay window Westy ('73-'79) goes flying across the camera shot
and they pan to follow his steady progress.

Cut to scene of 2 or 3 cars on the side of the road and no one else
actually driving.

The VW is the hero of the day! :)

Oh yeah, I need to correct a statement I made earlier about the number
of busses in Santa Cruz: I said that I would not be able to drive for
30 minutes without seeing at least 6 of them. Well, the next day I was
in Santa Cruz and counted 6 in 1 minute! So now let's say that you
can't scan the horizon without seeing a bus :)
