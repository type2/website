One thing that irked me while living in California - the small distances
drivers kept between themselves and the cars in front of them. Then people
wonder why so many accidents on the  fog bound 101...

Here in Canada, Toronto actually, theyput chevrons on the highway - to
mark the distance ther should be between you and the car in front. yes, we
are a more law and order oriented society.

Happy Canada Day Vanagonians everywhere!
