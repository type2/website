&gt;I don't want to drill any holes in my van's body (or my body either for 
&gt;that matter), so I was planning on running the support poles vertically to 
&gt;the ground. I tried this setup with the A&amp;E awning at an RV store and it 
&gt;works fine. You just have to secure the ends of the poles to the ground 
&gt;somehow (tent stake) to keep them from getting knocked or blown out from 
&gt;under the awning.

How about attaching them to something secured by the wheels.  I'm picturing a
couple of pieces of wood or something that you drive the van onto, that
extends out away from the passenger side of the van.  Then attach the pole to
the wood.  

Just a thought.
