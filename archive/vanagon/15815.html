Well, when I built the engine for my bus last September I used an AE 
case from a '71 or so bug.  I bought a new set of 8mm German studs for 
it.  So when I was putting the on the heads I started torqueing the the 
heads on according to Muir, doing a quarter turn a nut.  I was taking it 
up to 23 when a stud broke.  I told the shop and they said that they 
should only go up to 18, but were supprised that a stud would break at 23.
It seems that 23 is for the 10mm studs.
