Thanks Jim for the reply about the Suspander struts. I think I may
rest a little easier after getting your e-mail. BTW, I ordered the
regular variable lift style struts for my Vanagon and I do have a rear
wiper. Everything seems to be working OK but am I looking at having
problems again due to the extra weight caused by my wiper?

TIA,
