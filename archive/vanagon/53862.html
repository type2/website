Subject: Re: Connecting  a 2nd battery &amp; fridge questions

hi volks-

I mostly lurk and appreciate all the great advise I've received here.  While 
making the connections for the second battery in my '88 Westfalia and reading 
in Bentley, I conclude I am either reading the wiring diagram incorrectly, or 
someone else is.  From my reading of the diagram, terminal 87 is switched and 
30 is direct to the + post on the main battery.  This is definitely not what I 
have seen here and in the Ron's faq.  While I don't have my Bentley at work, 
could someone look at this and tell me who is right?

TIA

&gt; Harold, 
&gt; With the original setup, before the aux battery was installed, the 
&gt; fridge was connected to the switched post(30) of the relay while the 
&gt; water pump and control panel were connected to the unswitched post (87) 
&gt; of the relay. The result was that the fridge only received 12v when 
&gt; the engine was running while the control panel and water pump had 12v 
&gt; all of the time (the control panel read the status of the primary 
&gt; battery).
