Subject: Song Parody Archive - problem (eek)

All,

Anyone who has tried to download files from http://www.type2_dot_com/songs/ has
probably noticed that the files don't play correctly or won't download. I'm
not sure whether to blame it on encoding problems or uploading problems,
but I'm aware of two problems, which are:

1. File won't download properly when clicked on. This can be worked around
by right-clicking on the link, choosing &quot;Save Link As...&quot; and then saving
the file. When it's done, it should be playable on any .mp3 player.
Hopefully, when Problem #2 is fixed, the files will download correctly.

2. File has noise in background and/or does not play completely. This is
either an encoding problem or a file transfer problem. I am re-encoding
affected files and uploading them tonight. Workaround is to wait until
tonight, when I post a notice that the fixed files are up.

Apologies to those who took the time to download the files. This *will* be
fixed, or I will have Bill Gates' head on a silver platter. :) I've gotten
good responses so far and plan to continue doing .mp3s. However, I'm not
sure whether or not Ron Lussier will archive the .mp3s - Ron?

Have a great Sunday!

- J
