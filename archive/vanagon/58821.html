&gt;E-MAIL LAST MONTH.
&gt;     THE PROGRAM-WHICH CAN ATTACK ANY DOS,WINDOWS 95, OR WINDOWS
&gt;3.1OPERATING SYSTEM-ALSO COULD IMPLANT OBSCENE MESSAGES.

Everyone remember:

1. A virus like program can not spread in an e-mail message. While an
   infected program could be attached to an e-mail message, the e-mail
   message itself cannot contain one in any form that could be executed.

2. A virus or Trojan horse program can not infect a system by simply being
   read. The current mail readers do not execute an e-mail message, they
   display it on the screen for you to read. You must take care when
   downloading an attachment to an e-mail message. In some mail readers
   you can double click on the attachment icon to have it extracted and
   opened by whatever program created it. If that attachment is a program,
   it is downloaded and run, and running any program you have not scanned
   could cause you to be infected with a virus.

3. What Roy is describing is a Trojan horse program. That Trojan horse
   is attached to an e-mail message and if the reader downloads
   and executes the Trojan horse program, it will do the damage described
   in Roy's message.
