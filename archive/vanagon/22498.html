Bob,
	You guys live out towards Borrego Springs?   This is still great 
California &quot;dream land?&quot;   I dream places in Anza.  Does &quot;still&quot; worry 
you all, too.  Man, the CA dream got flushed along the way.  I do not 
point to the folk from down south.  CA was a place of leasure, of course 
we earned it, but people came out to work.  And their work created a land 
that created more work...  Not the Beach Boy scene.  Last December Yvonne 
and I drove up &quot;indian&quot; trails in our '67 that I have not visited in 6 
years.  It was night and foggy.  Towards the top of a way remembered 
trails, Thick fog, we smelt sheep, lots of them(we live in Christchurch 
New, zealand most of the year), pretty hoof prints wher4e we camped.  
Bob, you guys got some nice stomping grounds(or is you Borrego not my 
sheep?)  We got to get out of NZ.  Those Hippies and Teachers leave any  
space for lazy hard workers?   Serious.  Gary Gibson
