Subject: response on plastics


I don't want to e-mail bomb the air or water bus/van lists with
the responses I promised to many of you.  I did post it
to the ccc's camping mailing list, since it seems the bulk
of the discussion has gone on there.  If any of your are
interested, let me know privately, and I'll be happy to send
you a copy of what I posted there.
