&gt; &gt;My '87 Vanagon has blown 5, yes 5 different coolant hoses since last Labor
&gt; 
&gt; were they all the same hoses?? or each time a different one? it might be
&gt; related to a radiator that's getting more and more clogged over time. or
&gt; just age on the hoses.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;need to be replaced. Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and replace
&gt; &gt;the rest (might have to get a 2nd mortgage on the house)? Are you guys
&gt; 
&gt; my 88 hasn't done this ... yet. :(  any other 87's or older losing hoses?

Well..., you may remember last week I posted the story about my wife driving
after the water pump fan belt broke. This burst 4 hoses, blew the water
pump and broke the plastic housing where there is a 2 into 1 conversion. 

Yesterday (7 days after the incident), the dealer called all happy because 
the final part had just come in. After the mechanic tried to put it all
together he realized the plastic housing hadn't been ordered. AAARRRGGGH! 
Now it will be another 2 to N days waiting for this part. (Where N equals
?????)

It burns me because I specifically mentioned to the service manager that
I saw coolent leaking from this part.  This is the first and last time 
this dealer will ever do any work on my vanagon.

Talk about frustrating!
