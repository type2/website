&gt;Perfect for punching holes in the radiators of those tailgaters when I
&gt;tap the brakes.  I recommend everyone get a trailer hitch on their bus,
&gt;even if you're never going to tow anything.  :)
&gt;Found the hitch at the junkyard, btw...

I will add:
I haven't done that for my Thing yet, but my Chevy has a solid trailer
hitch on it, and when I am tailgated, usually by a Camaro, or something
with an equally low front grille.  My rear bumper is a perfect height
for destroying a perfect radiator. :-&gt;he,he,he

One evening I was driving home from Dallas to Austin, and I came upon a
woman in one of those new Dodge cars(Cirrus or something like that), of
course she was in the passing lane(it seems that I am the only one in
the right lane, even if I am going faster than the traffic(people drive
less than the speed limit unless it is 55 or less, than they drive 70+),
well whenever someone comes up to her bumper, she pulls into the right
lane, and as soon as that person passes her, she moves into the left
lane, regardless of whether or not there is someone else waiting to
pass. It gets ridiculous people in Texas refuse to move over, and they
give you dirty looks if they do.

Cheers from the right lane,
