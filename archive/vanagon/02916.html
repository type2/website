Subject: LSD, the geat hippies, lineage..

&gt;From the messages I see running through this list in the last two months I
get the impression that a higher percentage of Vanagon list people have tried
mind altering substancesin the distant past than one would find in the
general population. The Volkswagen bus has always stood for
something--something about people who are more adventuresome and interesting
than the norm. Perhaps all this talk is just Woodstock in the air again. I
don't need to rummage out a headband and grow my hair long to remember my
roots. I wonder, though, whether driving a 1990 Vanagon is a way of keeping
in touch with those roots without appearing odd in terms of society today.
