&gt; I would consider it a ball park figure if there is no rust and the camping
&gt; equipment is in good shape.  Check the fridge, stove, water pump, general
&gt; condition of the pop-top.  Weekender?  Does that version have all of this
&gt; stuff?

The weekender has the pop top with bed, rear bench bed and fold out table.
No fridge/stove/sink.

The Eurovan Weekender does have a fridge under the driver's side rear
facing bucket seat.
