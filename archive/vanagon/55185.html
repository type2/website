Subject: Re: still confused

Short addendum here:

Both the Eurovans I recently test drove, '95 and '97, could seat 6 (7 in a
squeeze) with the center bench seat. This seat does block access to the 
cabinets and refrig though. Not too good a design in my mind. You'd have to
take a cover or tent to store the seat (comes out easily) in while you were
in campsite. Has 2 tables, but they may be a safety hazard if in use during
driving. Both bench seats will hold 2 adults comfortably, I really can't 
remember if they have 3 seat belts.

Some Westies, full campers, did come with, or you could get, 1 rear facing seat
for behind the passenger. You lost the swivel capability of the passenger to
only 45 degrees. then you could possibly seat 5-6. Again I cannot remenber if
there were 3 seatbelts on the rear bench, but only 2 adults fit comfortably.
The swing out table is a bit more stable in travel, although you should remem-
ber that any hard object can be a safety hazzard in an accident.

Both of these are 'full camper' configurations.

&gt; &gt; What (if any) Eurovan and/or Vanagon comes with:
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  pop top
&gt; &gt;  fold down bed
&gt; &gt;  preferably front wheel drive
&gt; &gt;  2 rear facing seat --OR-- middle bench seat (Either way seats 7)
&gt; &gt;  full fridge
&gt; &gt;  stove and or sink
&gt; &gt;  tables for kids to color on/play board games etc.
&gt; &gt;  cup holders
&gt; &gt;  cabinets
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like you're looking for a motor home.  
&gt; Vanagons ('80-'91) and Eurovans('93+) typically come in either passenger
&gt; versions that seat 7 or Camper versions that seat 4-6.
&gt; No Vanagon or Eurovan was made that BOTH seats 7 AND has the
&gt; fridge/stove/sink/cabinets.
&gt; 
&gt; You'll need to choose either the full camping gear or the seating for 7.
&gt; 
&gt; Complete Camper models were offered every model year from VW, the later
&gt; models being named the Vanagon Camper GL.  These include all the camping
&gt; stuff, but only seating for 4.  It is possible to add a center 2 passenger
&gt; seat (from a passenger Vanagon) to one of these to bring the seating capacity
&gt; to 6, but it blocks access to the refer/stove/sink.  Whith this arrangement
&gt; you could set the van up for camping/seating for 4 OR seating for 6.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1986 &amp; 1987 VW made a basic version of the Camper model that has a
&gt; pop-top, refrigerator, fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating
&gt; for 6 (six).
&gt; 
&gt; In 1990 &amp; 1991 they offered the MultiVan model that was similar, offering the
&gt; pop-top,  fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating for 7, but no
&gt; refrigerator.
&gt; Neither of these models offers the stove/sink but do have a single rear
&gt; cabinet.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that in 1993 VW offered the Eurovan MV which was similar to the
&gt; Vanagon MultiVan in layout, but of course with the Eurovan's front mounted 5
&gt; cylinder engine driving the front wheels.  Vanagons have rear mounted 4
&gt; cylinder engines typically driving the rear wheels.  Vanagons were also
&gt; offered in later years with Syncro all-wheel drive.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
