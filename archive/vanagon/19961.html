Lets see...

Sneak into the helicopter maintainance company thats nearby and swipe
a turbine from an old jet ranger, and while you're there get some
guages and toggle switches to mount on the ceiling between the driver and
passenger seats. Back home cut up the vanagon engine leaving the
flywheel and some mounting spots. Once the turbine is in place (remember
to drain the gas tank and fill up with jet-b, or just plain kerosene), and
all the electrics connected (solder those crimps!) its time to fire it up.
Remember - keep the clutch pedal depressed until the turbine is at normal
operating temps - then raise the turbine speed to a point where max torque
is produced (any help out there with exact numbers?) - select first gear or
reverse (depending on how you parked the car the night before) and smoothly,
but confidently let the clutch pedal up. 

It will be time to shift sooner than you may expect.

Putting fins on the van and painting it black add a nice touch.

&quot;To the Batagon, Robin!&quot;
