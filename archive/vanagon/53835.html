Subject: Re: Rusty East-Coast Vanagons (was Syncro for Sale: Md) 



&gt;The prices I see on this list seem very low compared to what they are here
&gt;in Arizona...Are these nice vanagons or has the rust problem of the 
&gt;eastern states really set in to these vanagons?  


In my experience, it's gotten progressively harder to find solid Busses 
here on in the Philadelphia area,to the point that most of the completely 
solid ones I've seen recently are either garage kept or from elsewhere.  
Vanagons, however, hadn't seemed as rust prone, until recently.  For the 
first time, I've started noticing some Vanagons with major cancer. Severely 
rusted Vanagons aren't the norm here yet (more common is surface rust 
around the body panel seams), but 100% rust-free ones are no longer the 
norm either.  I guess it's to be expected, unfortunately, as they get 
older...
