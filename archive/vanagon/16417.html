&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;4 VW Vanagon tires for sale, Michelin X, 185 R14, PR6, XZX.  Two of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;have about 200 miles on them, two have about 1,500 miles on them.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;came off of a 1987 Vanagon.  Asking $220.  ($290 + balancing &amp; valves new.)

That's a fair price, I believe. I paid $85 a piece for new ones.

&gt;
&gt;I know people think highly of these tires, but I have a couple of questions:
&gt;- do they have sufficient strength for a camper?

Yes, if they are REINFORCED.

&gt;- I have 205r14 tires on my camper now - does one need new rims to switch
&gt;  to a different size like this? (They don't have rims - the van was totaled
&gt;  and the owner only got the tires off it.)

No, you don't need new rims.
