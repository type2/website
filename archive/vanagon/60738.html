Subject: Clutch Woes Need Advice

My 81 Westie clutch decided to hang-up yesterday.Heard a big &quot;thunk,&quot; which
sounded like the engine moving on loose mounts; the clutch will no longer
fully disengage.
I think there is sufficient travel in the arm of the clutch - when pedal is
depressed, the external clutch lever will move to a horizontal orientation.
No leaks noticeable in any hydraulics, nor is resevoir low at all. Pumping

neutral and turning off engine when I had to stop. Starting involved putting

don't think I have a problem there. Clutch clearly drags when in gear and
attempting to push clutch in while Van was &quot;coasting&quot; down hill with engine

stuff and a vise - and most of the manuals recommend doing the job from
underneath. Not really an option for 
So what do we think we've got going on here?  BTW, clutch still &quot;clutches&quot;
fine with 

Please feel free to contact me direct E-mail, as I live in digest mode, and
really could use some advice re: what's going on here.
