Subject: Re: Off to the Vinyard...



&gt;&gt; We're loading the EV onto the boat tomorrow nite and heading to
&gt;&gt; the island...home of the Teddy Kennedy Swim-with-your-back-brace-in-
&gt;&gt; a-drunken-fog Marathon.....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Martha's Vinyard...and its smaller appendage..Chappaquidik
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of which... wasn't there a VW ad circa 1969 which  went something
&gt;like this: &quot;if Ted Kennedy owned a VW beetle he would be president today&quot;.
&gt;The ad was touting the bug's ability to float because of its air-sealed
&gt;compartment....


Indeed there was! But it wasn't a real &quot;ad&quot;... it was in the inside
front cover of National Lampoon magazine. It was a take-off on
the &quot;real&quot; VW ad on TV, where they drove a VW into a swimming pool
and watched it float, while the announcer droned on about how well-
sealed and watertight the dorrs etc. are.

The Natl Lampoon ad, looked just like the TV ad, with same camera
angles, shading, etc. But it was missing the little VW logo that
appeared in all the real ads, and the caption was what you mentioned.
It was GREAT!!!

Right up there with, &quot;If character doesn't matter, then why isn't
Teddy Kennedy President?&quot;
