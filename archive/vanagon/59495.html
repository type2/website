Subject: 81 Westy for Sale
Date: Wed, 7 May 1997 17:26:04 -0400

I have a 1981 Westy with full camp setup (less stove).  Just had VW
factory motor and axles installed 7k miles ago, and new 6500k tires less
than two weeks old.  Price: $3950.  If you can give her a good home give
me a call at (910)759-4638.  I'm located in Winston-Salem, NC.
