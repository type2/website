&gt; The joints can be purchased for $50-60 and good german CV boots are about
  $15.00. It's a messy job, if you are entertaining the idea of doing it 
  yourself, but not difficult. 

  Noisy joints can sometimes be fixed, at least temporarily, by cleaning the
  joint and putting in fresh grease. If parts are broken, you'll have to
  replace. You could certainly extend the life of your three quiet joints
  with the clean and re-lube, IMHO.

&gt; I have an '85 Vanagon that needs new CV joints. I was just interested in
&gt; seeing how much all of you had paid for your replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; The guy quoted 185 for a new joint and labor for 1 (that's making the most
&gt; noise)
&gt; 
&gt;                             OR
&gt; 
&gt; $580 for all 4.
&gt; 
&gt; I know for sure that I can't do all 4...I'm a student w/ $5 in checking and
&gt; $20 in savings. Is there anything that I can do to make sure the other 3
&gt; last just until summer? I should have enough $$$$ for it then.
&gt; 
&gt; *Any* help or suggestions are appreciated!
