Subject: HELP!!!!  Coolant Flush and Fill not going well

&gt;From dbax_at_netcom_dot_com  Sat Dec  3 11:57:21 1994

I have only managed to get 1 gallon of coolant in the system and the 
radiator does not appear to be filling, as I run the engine to fill the 
coolant, the engine begins to overheat and the radiator fan does not come 
on.  If anyone can help me through this, like maybe a little telephone 
support (??) I would be most grateful.--
