&gt;BTW, I did forward the Bus Summary to Jeff.

I already snagged it as &quot;[A]FAQ for Air-Cooled VW Part 3/3: Bus Summary&quot; (no
quotes), though I don't remember from where -- maybe rec.auto.vw.  (Too many
miles with a leaky exhaust.)  Extremely helpful to us new-guys.  You might
give Tobin a pointer to it.  Thanks for remembering me, though.

If Tobin reads the FAQ and Muir, p. 325-336, he'll be off to a running start.
 (Muir = How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive, by John Muir, ISNB 0-945465-12-2,
John Muir Publications, POBx 613, Sante Fe, NM 87504, (505)982-4078, approx.
$24 shipped UPS.  A MUST HAVE book.)
