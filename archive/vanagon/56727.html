&gt;saw a 68 camper in La Jolla recently w/ a pinto engine.  that's a 100hp
&gt;before any performance tweaks.  tough little motor.  i had a '73 2L run
&gt;(hard :-) ) to 145K before having to pull head first time.  actually fit
&gt;the '68 pretty well.  this conversion ran pipes up starboard side to
&gt;radiator on or in the nose (couldn't see the mounting specifics, was
&gt;covered with a bra).  looked like the guy had cut some holes in the deck
&gt;for maintenance access -- couldn't see why he needed them tho'.  seemed to
&gt;be plenty of room in there.

My brother is about to remove the water cooled unit from his VW 
Transporter (it's on its way out and is too expensive to replace) and 
stick in a second-hand air cooled unit.

He is a bit miffed about moving down to a 1600cc unit, but its a lot
cheaper than a replacement water cooled engine.

Has anybody any ideas what problems he might hit before he gets
started??
