Hi all, I hope the summer season is going well so far and your bus
related &quot;problems&quot; are more interesting than enraging. 
	My question involves the Optima 750U deep cycle battery I just
installed per the FAQ instructions. It indicates green light hunky-dory
when the engine is running but red (dead) when the engine is off. This
occurs as a 1-2 second fade from the yellow LED to the red LED. The
charger I have indicates a fully charged battery and no amps being
drawn.
Any ideas?
Thanks as always,
Jay
