Subject: cheap cross country transport?
Date: Sat, 30 Mar 1996 19:46:20 GMT

HI all

good news:  I have found a '77 westy with lots new in the past couple
yrs.. owner has receipts for $2k to $3k worth of work ( by garage )
now the engine has gone and he wants to get rid of it for about $1200

bad news:  I need to get to NY.  i'm an inexeperienced mechanic.  with
my new Muir book in hand though, i'm willing.. no, i'm eager to try a
rebuild.  however, i nead to get to upstate ny from northern colorado
with non driveable bus (if i buy it).  i have no facility here
whatsoever to attempt rebuild before i go.

i'm a little eager to buy here as availabitly of rust free vehicles in
northeast is small and often demands a premium. 

question:  any thoughts on cheap way to move the bus and myself?

thanks
MIke
