&gt; I just got my VW video in the mail.  It is called &quot;In our time:  Volkswagen
&gt; Reborn, an informational presentation&quot;.   I haven't watched it yet (no TV),
&gt;  but think they will push Concept 1.   
&gt; 
&gt; I also got a paper suggesting I go down to the local dealership and test
&gt; drive a new VW.  They lure me with offers of 60 mins free on a calling card.
&gt;  Maybe I'll go down and drive a new EV, say the 54 is gettin on a bit now....
&gt; 
&gt; Tee hee heee
&gt; 
&gt; 
Just called this morning for my video and Jerry poster.  It was quite 
painless and the person at VW offered an internet VW disc(?)  I took it 
and will report back on its contents.  
sittin' by the mail box!
