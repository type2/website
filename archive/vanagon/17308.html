&gt; 
&gt; 			     While reducing our field test data to the
&gt; proper format for the data sheet, we became intrigued with comparative
&gt; acceleration and deceleration rates, and came up with the interesting
&gt; fact that the average deceleration rate from 60 mph to stop was exactly
&gt; twice the average acceleration rate to 60 mph from a standing start.  It
&gt; is comforting to know that you can stop in half the distance that it
&gt; took you to reach a given speed.

Well I shore would hope so.  I bet it took them a quarter mile to get up
to 60 mph.  Looking at it the other way, they are saying that because
the bus decelerated from 60 to 0 in 160 feet, it will accelerate from
0 to 60 in 320 feet?  Get real!  Bad math on their part, methinks, in
that last sentence.  I think it should be more like the *square root* of
the distance, but I'm not sure.  My last physics class was many years ago.
