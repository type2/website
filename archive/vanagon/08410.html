Subject: Re: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?


	Regarding paint scheme- satisfy yourself! I always wanted
to paint my 914 up like an F-14- overall grey, with stars and bars
on the doors, RESCUE arrows pointing to the door handles, NO STEP
stenciled on the trunk and hood, my initials (WBAIV) above the
rear-wheel arches in the same Helvetica that the Navy writes NAVY
in, and the serial number on the fender behind the rear wheels.
Oh yeah, and my name on the driver's door and my late wife's
name on the passenger door. Or maybe other way around as politicing!

	I mean, c'mon, its the logical conclusion of any sports
car fantasy, unless you want to paint racing stripes on it,  
and your name, nationality and blood-type on the door.

	I've seen some way-cool non-factory bus paint schemes,
but be sure you wash it thoroughly and attend to rust before painting.
Even if just spray-paint from a can. Shoot light colors first, 
But above all, THINK BIG. One primary color under each window would
be excellent. Get exactly the colors you want. Use masking tape on the window
and window rubber. Take off the door handles, mirrors, etc first.
Use the best paint you can afford. Remember, this will radically lower
your resale value. 

	One year, for the prom, some kids from the highschool across
the street from me took a big american station wagon and cut the roof
off with a torch, then spray painted the rest of the car black and white,
in a cow pattern, including the wheel-covers and tires, and wrote
&quot;Bovine Love&quot; on the driver's door, and mounted a pair of horns on the
hood. I presume 2 or 3 couples got to the prom in this thing. Then
they tried to sell it for $250, with a For Sale sign on the street.
Someone stole the horns, and I don't think they got the $250, but
I took two pictures of it. It was wonderful!
