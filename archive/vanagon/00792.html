Subject:       Re: Rear axle nuts

&gt; Does anyone have any ideas about how to
&gt; get a stuck drum off after the nut is removed? I've tried everything except
&gt; a drum puller, which may be the last resort... Thanx, A Van Fan
&gt; 

Back off the adjusting screw for the brakes and then  put the wheel 
back on the drum.  The wheel will give you something to pull on.  If 
this don't work then perhaps a drum puller will be required but I 
have never needed one.  Yank like hell on that wheel it should come 
off.  Good luck.
