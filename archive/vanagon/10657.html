&gt; The suspect:  Blown oil cooler seal.
&gt; Now, how much would a new oil cooler run me?  Gasket set?
&gt; I presume that the engine must be removed in order to 
&gt; perform this service.  Correct?  ('74 II) 

I'll let some of the type IV people give you the particulars,
but unless you get the thing out and find holes in the cooler,
you should only have to do the seals (Just did them on my '71)

&gt; I'm
&gt; also wondering if dropping the engine can be done by one
&gt; guy (no gender specificity). 

Sure, it can be dropped by one humanoid unit -- getting it
back in works a heck of a lot better with two ;-&gt;
