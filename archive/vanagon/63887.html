Subject: sliding door adjustment, '78

Yesterday my dad and I spent some time (alright, a lot of time)
R&amp;Ring the sliding door on my 78 bus.  New gasket, cleaned the
rust out of the crevice where the gasket resides, and swapped
out the rear hinge for a better (used) one.

Upon trying to adjust the door, we had some problems.  Mainly,
we couldn't get the front edge of the door to pull in tight against
the new gasket.  We adjusted the top and bottom brackets to the
limit of their travel, and could still see light between the door
and the gasket.  Also, the door is not flush with the body, but
stands out about 1/16&quot; or more along the whole front edge.

The top bracket looks like it could be machined to give some more
adjustment by cutting the two screw slots a little further.  The
bottom bracket doesn't seem so simple.  Anybody have any sugestions
how I could get the door to close better?

TIA,
Rodney
