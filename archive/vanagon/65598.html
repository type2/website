&gt; I have an '86 Syncro that has the default 1986 Vanagon owner's manual.
&gt; In it there is nothing about the Syncro.  Was there, in fact, a Syncro
&gt; owner's manual?  If so, any of you merchants or parts houses sell them?

    In 1986 the Syncro came with a second manual, syncro
    spesific. I haven't seen this for any other year.
