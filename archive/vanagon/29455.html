&gt;any ideas how much it might cost to ship an 2l air-cooled motor/exhaust
&gt;system from los angeles to michigan?

I shipped a Vanagon transmission to CA from Baltimore via RPS for rebuilding.
 Just put in in a heavy cardboard box with a lot of packing.  RPS picked it
up at my front door - it think it was less than a $100 bucks (with insurance)
 for shipping.  UPS won't deliver it because of size or weight restrictions.
  

I also checked with a company in CA to rebuild one of my Vanagon motors.
 They said send it by Air Freight but I would have to deliver it to the
terminal.  They wanted it strapped down to a pallet for shipping.
