Subject: Re: List Bumper Sticker?

&gt;From: RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu

&gt; The Autocross list....&quot;Team.Net&quot; have stickers with the list name
&gt; and a &quot;generic&quot; car racin' around pylons...perhaps
&gt; we could have the list name with each of the four generations
&gt; of Type 2s on each of the corner, and the list name in the center.

I have the GIF version of the sticker.  It has a mouse (the computer kind)
going between plyons.  How about a bus driving around flannel, crisco
and prunes?  ;-)
