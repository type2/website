&gt;her (my still nameless 86GL. anyone have any ideas for a good name? I was
&gt;going to use &quot;Betty&quot; (after my late Grandmother) but I see that's taken) to

so?? lots of folks out there named &quot;Betty&quot;. :) if it is blue, she could
be Betty Blue. :) or Susie Silver or Long John Silver or some such. but
don't try to force it ... it'll come. my silver camper is currently nameless,
but i think his name is gonna be HiHo (Silver, Away!!). ;) either that or
something along the lines of AG being the symbol for Silver. Agatha? nah ...
my buses seem to be Hims instead of Hers. not sure why. Aggie? Agustine?
AwGee?? :)

&gt;only electrical thing that is wet is the wires to the o2 sensor. I wiped

but if this shorts out, the computer will think the O2 sensor died and
start mucking up the mixture. :( it MIGHT cause it to die, depending on
what you were doing to the gas pedal at the moment.

&gt;without going to the outside. Also, can I clean all the contacts and spray
&gt;them WD-40 to make them more water resistant? I have had some good luck

well, if it's worked before on other cars, it's worth a try. i'd also suspect
the distributor cap ... what used to happen with me is that the cap wasn't
sealing well, and the hot exhaust would hit water/rain/whatever, and steam
would come up into the engine compartment and get inside the cap. the engine
would die, i'd coast to the side, open the engine hatch, use paper towels to
dry out the cap, and presto, it all worked again. go figure. but it only
happened when i hit deep puddles or started raining REALLY hard. this was
on an old bus, with points and condensors. i haven't had this problem on the
watercooled buses ... maybe they don't get enough steam in the engine area,
or since the engine area isn't sealed, the steam doesn't sneak into the
cap.
