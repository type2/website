On my 1984 Caravelle GL the driver's side had the convex mirror and the
passenger side had a flat one. I searched hi and lo for a cheap convex
mirror for the passenger side but finally had to get a dealer part. This is
in the UK. I understand that in the US the mirrors are usually the other
way round - ie the driver get the flat mirror and the passenger the convex
one. This makes more sense. I think your setup and my original setup were
anomalous.

&gt; 
&gt; Now that I have my '84 Westy running, I noticed something strange.  The 
&gt; Driver's side mirror is slightly convex, providing a nice wide view.  
&gt; Since I thought a convex mirror on the driver's side was not allowed on 
&gt; US cars, this seemed a bit strange.  Then, I noticed that the passenger 
&gt; side mirror was flat, providing a nearly useless view.  I tried swapping 
&gt; the mirrors, but couldn't quite adjust them to the correct positions.
&gt; 
&gt; So, a few questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) are the two mirrors on an '84 Vanagon interchangable?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Is the normal position for the mirror vertical (like mine are), or 
&gt; horizontal (like they were when I swapped them)?
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps they were taken apart and re-assembled differently to end up this

&gt; way.
