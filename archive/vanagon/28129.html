Subject: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

to All:
Someone has been asking if MOFOCO is respectable?  well, on a 
slightly askew slant, i ask why they and many others sellings VW 
stuff go for the cheap T&amp;A in their shots and ads?  Isn't that a 
little out of date in the 1990's?

I realize i'm stuck up in the tundra of Northern MN (by choice) where 
there are maybe 3 days a year where one can wear that kind of apparel 
(male or female, we're pretty liberal up here) but nearly all 
companies are letting go of this type of advertising.  tool companies, 
car magazines, chemical companies all are becoming more aware of 
sexism in advertising, if from strictly a market standpoint if 
nothing else.  why does it persist in VW culture when supposedly VW 
people have higher states of consciousness than the peasantry?  maybe 
it's only BUS people that achieve this hightened awareness  :)

anyway, food for thought on a Monday morning...
