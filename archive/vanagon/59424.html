Kathy,

Have you checked out the wiring?  Your motors -may- be just fine with
your problems coming from a break in the wire somewhere (possibly
grounding out with just a tear in the insulation, no less).  What
exactly are your symptoms?  There have been a number of
problems/solutions talked about that you should be able to find in the
archives.

Good luck,
Tonya
