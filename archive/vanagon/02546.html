Subject: RE: rear hatch struts

&gt;From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;somebody (ray?) was looking for rear hatch struts for their vanagon ...
&gt;and i just happened to get this rather strange message a few minutes ago.
&gt;i've deleted all the non-bus stuff, and i know NOTHING about these folks
&gt;.. not even sure how they got my address. so buyer beware (?).

&gt;           VW/AUDI list              Prices good while supply lasts.
&gt;              v2.0                   Most v1.0 prices still good.

I got the list a few minutes ago myself.  I don't know how Joel got on it since
you have to send in your name and e-mail address.  I know that Wolfsport is
legitimate because I have ordered stuff from them several times for my GTI.
I don't know anything about German Auto.
