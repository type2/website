&gt; Could someone please tell me how to unsub?  Thanks...

see, that's the whole crux of the matter.  you can't unsub.  oh, 
sure-- many of us have tried it but to little avail.  when one 
subscribes to vanagon_at_lenti 2 things happen:

1.  your computer address is permanently entered into Gerry's 
database and tied into TRW credit files, bank records, and the DMV.  
you can unsub but you will be found within a matter of milliseconds 
and resubscribed.

2.  secondly, a dendrite of mycelial infection, transmitted from the 
keyboard to the fingertips, establishes itself in your brain.  you 
THINK you want to unsub, you KNOW you should for the betterment of 
your family and career, but simply, you can't.  your neural pathways
have been consumed by the lenti fungi and you have become its slave.

you might as well just stay and enjoy our company.  it's not a choice 
any of us have made.
