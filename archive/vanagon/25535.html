Subject: VW repairs shops directory

In my many attempts to find a suitable bus, I am running into a common 
problem.  Due to the lack of buses for sale, I end up driving an hour in one 
direction and then maybe an hour in the opposite direction to see one.  
Since I am not extremely familiar in repairing/rebuilding VW buses, I find 
it hard to evaluate the condition.  I can only judge them by their outward 
appearance.  I have dealt with a VW shop before with my '72 bug and they 
offer a complete pre-sale check-out for about 50 bucks.  This is all just 
fine except that I find myself and hour or more away when looking at the 
buses.  Keep in mind that I have only seen buses from a distance or from 
peering through a window.  How should I go about having one checked out 
under these circumstances.  Most of the time the VW shop require an 
appointment and as mentioned can be 100 miles away.  Should I just use the 
yellow pages to find a shop local to the potential purchase or what?  It may 
seem like a silly question, but I hate to jump into a purchase without the 
proper consideration.  My excitement over finding one has just about gotten 
me into trouble already.  I've heard stories of people waiting a year, two, 
or even three to find the &quot;right&quot; one.  I can't wait that long!!  Is there a 
directory of places I could use to have the buses checked out?  Even that's 
not cheap at $50 a pop.   Help!?!?!?
