Subject: help - bentley manual

        I just called around to the 2 VW dealers in town and neither has a
Bently manual in stock. They can order them in no problem, but they cost
$145 + GST. Thats alot. I know it'll save me in the long run...but I have
to worry about my current short jog.
        So does anyone have a used one to sell (not likely huh?)? or else
does anyone know where I could order one for cheaper?

muchos thanks,
