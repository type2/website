Subject:      Cool low level warning control unit (84 Digijet)

I have been searching in the Bently VW Vanagon Official Factory Repair
Manual for the connections to the Cool low level warning control unit.  The
electrical system wiring diagram on page 97 shows one wire going to the
ground side of the cool temp gage, one wire going to ground, one wire going
to location 89 (the &quot;lite&quot; switch, and one wire toing to location 52.  So
help me, I can't find location 52.  Does anyone know it's location.  The 85
digijet shows the wire going to the emergency flasher relay. It appears
that this is a mistake.  I think the diagram should read point 90 instead
of point 52.  I would appreciate help in verifying this.  Thanks in
advance.

VW is still in the shop with the dealer.  It's been three weeks and they
haven't been able to complet the installation of the new engine.  Now they
say they want to replace the instrument cluster because the temp gage shows
hot and the red light wan't stop blinking.  Sure hope they haven't
overheated the new engine!

George in Columbus, GA (The VW is being worked on in Alabama, and that
probably explains the problem.  Someone once told me to be careful when
traveling West from Georgia; you could drop off the edge of the world!  I
think I understand what they meant!)
