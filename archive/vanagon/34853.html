[long diatribe snipped]

I think Bob's lost it due to an apparent overdose of oil, gasoline, 
magnesium, anti-freeze and other assorted automotive chemicals.

Anyone want to contribute to a fund for Shade Tree Mechanics I'm starting?

Maybe Bob can write a book on his method of brainstorming.  There's a 
bunch of those types of books going around right now.  Then he can 
contribute to his own rehabilitation.

Maybe we should just take away all his VW toys and make him work on Suburus.

Naaaaahhh!
