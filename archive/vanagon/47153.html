Subject: Re: 78 Westy questions

In a message dated 96-07-21 23:35:48 EDT, you write:

&gt;I've got a 78 Westy that I have had parked for 2 years.  When it was parked
&gt;It was running but would suddenly quit.  When I tried starting it then it
&gt;would start but
&gt;would not idle at all. 

This is coming from a complete amateur but I would check the points and
condensers under the distributor because mine had problems doing the same and
this is what ended up being the culprit.  If you keep revving the motor does
it stay alive?
