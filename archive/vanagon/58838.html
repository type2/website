Subject: Re: Dont blink your lights! *GANG DANGER*

I just shoot the people driving with their headlights off.  I figure, why
take any chances?

doing a

danger.
&gt;
&gt;There is at least a 50% chance possibility that you may find yourself
the
&gt;target of a gang initiation. It seems that some gangs initiate new
&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; by trolling in traffic with their headlights intentionally
left
&gt;off. Their goal is to wait until some well intentioned citizen blinks
their
&gt;lights at them intending to add to the saftey factor. The good
samaritian
&gt;ends up in the crosshairs of the newbie shooter.

&gt;I tend to think that I have a fairly decent &quot;sidewalk diploma&quot; in street
&gt;smarts but this was a new one on me. If I can help keep you and your
family
