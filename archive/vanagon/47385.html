Subject: Muffler &amp; pipe patches

From: &quot;W.R. Transue&quot; &lt;trans_at_castle_dot_net&gt;

I've had some on-going diologue with several listees concerning my muffler
system. Basically my situation is this: I've got a broken pipe (the previous
owner of my '87 Westy synchro patched it with either some sort of mettalic
tape or metal with hose clamps securing it), and the muffler itself is
missing the exhaust pipe which comes out the back (appears to have cracked
or broken off leaving a small hole nearly the diameter of the pipe which
went in, with a small triangular chunk ripped off one side of the opening).

I figure that there may be a way to buy an exhaust pipe to connect to the
muffler over the opening (assuming I can find a square or triangular flat
piece attached to the exhaust pipe) and either bolt or weld the piece over
the opening to create a new solid pipe.

I've also been told to weld a patch on the pipe. My question is how do I go
about this? Do I go to an automotive shop or seek out someone who does just
welding?

If anyone else has been doiwn this path I sure could use some advice!!

Thanks as always!
