&gt;Checked our 85 AFM, measured 561ohms between 3&amp;4. FWIW 2.3kohms in
&gt;parallel to 740 will produce the requisite 560 ohms. I know there is a
&gt;schematic for the AFM but can not locate. I will keep looking. On page
&gt;24.28 it is stated that 500 to 1000 ohms is OK. This confuses me
&gt;because I also have seen that 560 ohm spec somewhere.


Ken -

Thanks again for your looking - It might be noted that I have a 1984
published Bentley on page 24.28 that shows the 560 ohm spec.  However,
the latest published Bentley on page 24.28 says that terminals 3 &amp; 4
should be between 500 to 1000 (1K) ohms.  Would have never looked at the
updated Bentley unless you had mentioned it.  So the AFM MAY be OK, but
who knows?
