Subject: Re: European Car Mag Onto The List!


Maybe we can get them off of the EuroPeen' car bent and back into
the VW/Porsche bent. I remember that mag when it used to be VW Greats...
probably even have some back issues. But lately I stopped my subscription
and even buying it at the news stand because the VW content has gone
down in favor of articles about Saabs, MBzs, etc...

The only good thing I can say about EC is that they haven't stooped
to the Jocelyn Elders School of Adolescent Crank Polishing by 
having copious amounts of T&amp;A!!

(We won't mention advertisements disguised as Tech articles...   :-)  )
