Hey, I gotta jump in here. This point intrigues me. I spent a lot of time
rebuilding the heater system for the 82. New flaps were found (orange
silicone disc inserts), all the heater boxes were sealed and all the joints
were sealed and a thermostat was installed. In other words every effort was
made to ensure that the maximum possible heat could get from the rear  to
the front. And you know what? The air IS hot and the flow is pretty good
too even at idle (with a fan installed) except in the most coldest of
temps  - 20 C. To me the issue is not whether the heating system in
Vanagons is insufficient or that air -cooled engines produce lousy heat.
This is not true. The real problem is a) getting the heat from the front
to the back in as efficient way possible and b) making it stay there.
Simply put, the space is huge and the single tube is just not up to it.
So, what is really needed is  a way to insulate the van properly (as was
discussed this summer) and improving on the existing system to increase
air flow. Ideally VW should have had a third tube running up to the rear
seat and a way of recirculating all the hot air inside, plus a lot of top
quality insulation in the doors, roof and panels.
