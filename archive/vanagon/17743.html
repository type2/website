&gt; Some background:
&gt; Recently I've been getting electric shocks from the car (past week or so)
 after
&gt; driving it. Even over a short distance (20 yards!) I would get quite a jolt a
&gt; I climbed out...not noticed this before. (I know you can avoid it but that's
&gt; not the point)

Bad ground in ignition circuit?
Ground strap?
