Subject: Thanks All! Bought the'86 w/36K &amp; sunroof in Seattle

Volks,

     We joined this list about a month ago (at chris' suggestion)  in search
of a Vanagon GL.  We own a '84 GL and wanted to buy a newer one.  We were
having very little luck with the want ads in our area.  We received  a lot of
info from listees on 90-91 GLs and finally decided to buy the '86 GL with the
sunroof in Seattle.  Jeffry Olson posted this ad a few weeks ago and we
responded immediately.  We spent two weeks working out the details.
                
      Thanks to all who helped us: Jeffry Olson (for his original posting),
Rob Lebo (for his &quot;bound volume&quot; history), Kelly Bauman, Chris, Chet Douglas,
Chuck Ankeny, Brian Kraft, Jon Hathaway, Ken Lewis, joel (for his 2 long
letters), John (vwbus),      chris (JordanView) for his input and patience
with my limited computer skills, Don Gibbons,  Rick (will send you th AC info
this weekend), John Nyquist (who writes a very funny letter), and Roy Mathers
for his many EMails back and forth and especially for his ability to unearth
the impossible:  a RELIABLE  DUAL SYSTEM AC  for a '86 Vanagon with a
sunroof!!!!!!!!!!  When I have time I will share the info on the AC system.  
      The van belonged to a 91 year old man who had owned 13 vw vans in his
lifetime.  He walked to the grocery store and drove it once a week.  His
daughter's friend described him as a &quot;German car nut&quot; who was so concerned
about it's upkeep that he used to crawl under the car with the mechanic to be
sure the work was being done properly.  It's been garaged, no dents, not a
speck of rust, with covers on the front seats.  My brother went out and drove
it for us and said that the transmission is tight as a drum.  We've developed
a wonderful relationship with the family over the phone and feel more like we
are adopting a kid than buying a car.   It's really our dream-come-true and
we have the members of this list to thank for it.   
     We need a good name for it (preferably a German one).  It's metallic
silver.  Any suggestions?  We will also be putting Clyde (our '84 GL) out to
pasture before too long, but will post that information at a later date.
      In closing I'd like to say that we will probably stay on this list for
a while.  When I first began reading the listings, I felt like I was looking
in on a close-knit family of individuals who are generous with their time,
really care about one another, are warm, funny, and have excellent writing
skills.  Many subjects I read just for their entertainment value, and
invariably save them to share with the kids and Drew later.
     Thanks to all for this great service,

Warmly, 
Janet and Drew, Ramona and Joseph Van Riper
