Ouch!!

I guess I'm lucky.  I've got the house, and the two vans ('93 EV and
the '87, with collision coverage, $500 deductible, and _no_ limit on
the right to sue for damages) for a grand total sum of $1,400/yr.  I
was too stingy-- I did not register the '82 Westy for the winter.

 &gt; Greetings, all.  Indeed I pay so much more I get sick writing the numbers
 &gt; down.  Because I have two young men----I pay $5000 per year for three
 &gt; vehicles with me (old lady psychiatrist) and two lads 19 and 21 both of whom
 &gt; love to speed and don't mind getting tickets (actually each only 1 ticket
 &gt; every 18 months or so, not too bad considering their ages).  78 VW Westy, 84
 &gt; Volvo DL and 92 Subaru SVX.  $800 each car.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So--------count yerselves lucky!!  Enjoy all your money!!
