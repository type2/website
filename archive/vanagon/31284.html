Subject: No go on ice

glad to hear your van, and yourself are OK.

fortunately or unfortunately here in Texas, when it snows, sleets, or
freezes, the roads are empty except for a few transplanted northerners,
and others who always say, snow, what snow, these are flurries!

Cheers,

David

Hi, all.  Just a reminder to everyone out there in a snowy clime...As good as
the Bricks are in snow, they have trouble on glaze ice.  I was heading home
from work last night, going 30-35 mph as the highways were still kinda slushy
after our 6&quot; snow,  when I started across an elevated bridge.  I saw 2-3
inches of slush in the lane ahead (about 300 yards), and took my foot off the
accelerator so I wouldn't hit the snow full-bore.  Well, as soon as I let up
on the accelerator, the van started sliding immediately (I apparently hit
glare ice), and in less than 2 seconds I ran head-on into the side of the
bridge (I thought).  Four cars behind me who tried to avoid the Vanagon also
completely lost control, and two of them collided. (BTW, I have great rubber
on all four wheels).

Luckily, no one was hurt.  Also luckily, the snow piled along the side of the
bridge kept me from hitting the concrete :)  So, all I got was shaken nerves,
a smear of road grime on the front bumper, and a rude reminder that, no
matter how long I've driven in snowy conditions (every year since I've
driven) and think I know what I'm doing, there's always something out there
that can kill my confidence.  Take it easy out there (I was), and watch out
fer dem overpasses and bridges!

Peace and Merry Christmas/Hanukkah/whatever,

Cliff (still grinning nervously and almost over the adrenalin rush)
