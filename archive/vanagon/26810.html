Subject: re: Winnebago Rialta

We've been talking about a Rialta that would tow a Thing but the Thing 
WOULD be driven! Rialta to carry and satisfy the creature comforts of 
teenage girls.  A THing to satisfy the creature needs of ME!

&gt; Jim Davis asked about the above mentioned vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw one at the show in San Antonio 2 weeks ago, and I have to say I
&gt; was rather impressed with it. Some would say they weren't impressed, but
&gt; I was. Of course this one was probably the loaded one, with leather
&gt; seats, and plush carpeting.  I only wish that they put a larger engine
&gt; in it. It had the 5 cyl gas engine, though the owners towed(yech) their
&gt; Thing to the show, and won the Thing class. How could you not with a car
&gt; that never sees the road except from atop a trailer?
