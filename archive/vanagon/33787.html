Subject: FF/FS: '71 Campmobile ;)

&gt;From HotVWs on Wednesday:

&gt; 
&gt;  1968 VW truck in wonderful condition......
&gt;   $ 8,000. located in south carolina....
&gt; 

&gt;From Joe's front yard on Friday:

1971 VW campmobile in &quot;good condition.&quot; Runs, but needs carb work.  Recent
top-end rebuild by first-timer. Blue and primer-gray. Can have new paint
job before you see it. Roughened bondo for better handling due to dynamic
wind resistance. Meets Arkansas emissions standards (passengers don't pass
out from exhaust fumes as long as you keep the windows open). Stiff
shifter--doesn't slip out of gear. Recently (within last 10 years) painted
top--barely peeling; interesting brush stroke patterns! Some natural body
ventilation appearing in back corners and lower sides. Freshly salted
underside.  Auxiliary heater reputed to work by DPO. All tires hold air.
All curtains and good canvas. Westy interior only a with few rips in
vinyl. Seats in good condition, but need upholstering. Have new seals for
windsheild and back window. Half price this week only -- $4000. Will throw
in Japanese clone of 34PICT3 and spare engine with .016 end play and no
pistons. This is not a joke! I'll be happy to sell the bus at this price!
