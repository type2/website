Subject: parts III / brush guards

To everyone responding to the &quot;parts&quot; posting.   Because of the huge numbers
of people asking for fiberglass bumpers and alloys(surprise), I will, in all
fairness post the phone number of the gentleman along with the prices he
wants for all this stuff.  I will get prices for each and every item you
folks have requested,  the rest is up to you.      Expect the posting
tomorrow evening, between 7 and 8 EST. 

Item #2--- Brush guards.  Anyone interested in buying a Tri-star rep. guard?
 I want one for my van, I know a couple others that do, but I'm not gonna
make the jigs.....etc for just a couple.  Let me know..
