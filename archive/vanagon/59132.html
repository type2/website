Subject: Re: propane gauge?


In Germany we have to make use of a propane pressure gauge. But this is
only good for checking the propane system for leaks. If you recognized
that the flame on the stove is not burning as high as you expected, you
may check the pressure gauge and you know, the propane bottle is really
empty. No chance to get a tee kettle of hot water.

The only way to measure the stuffing is to weight the propane bottle.
If you subtract the container's weight you will get the netto weight.

I don't think a pressure gauge is of any value with a propane tank.  A
pressure gauge is useful with a compressed gas, but not a liquified gas.
With a liquified gas, the pressure will remain constant as long as there is
liquid in the tank-in other words, the gauge will read the same until the
tank is nearly empty.  I know that big RV's have propane monitors, but I
don't know how they work (weight? float and sending unit?).  The EV Winnie
has a gauge, but it is clearly not a pressure gauge, and I was never able
to figure out how to read it.  Surely somebody out there knows how these
things work?
