Hello all,
This weekend, I took Friday off from work and road-tripped from here (Johnson City, TN) to my girlfriend's house (Chester, VA) to hang out with her for the weekend.  It's about a 6-7 hour drive.  Normally.

I left Thursday evening after work, checked the bus out and got on the road.  It was raining most of the way up there so I naturally had my wipers on.  I began to notice that my wipers were making more of a clunk sound than normal, mainly they clunked when they reached the end of their leftward travel.  I didn't think much of it, they had always clunked a little.  It didn't bother me much.  Until they stopped.
