Subject:       Re: Refrigerator and Alarm

Hi Jeff.  Sorry, I misinterpreted your concern.  The Clifford alarm 
that I have * does *  sense the dome light on/off, as well as I have a 
shock sensor.  I have never had a false alarm caused by the fridge fan 
going on/off.  Not sure if the Clifford uses voltage drop method or 
what to detect if the door is opened... I'm not too up on these 
things.  Are there any other methods that alarms use to detect if the 
dome light is going on/off?

I have pin switches on the sliding door, license plate door, and rear 
hatch.  For the sliding door, the pin switches aren't much good as 
the reach is too far, and they break off.  I relented, and bought the 
VW switch parts (switch, rubber boot, and block for the door) and 
haven't had a problem in 4 years with this... besides it looks 
properly finished with the VW switch.

Hope this helps..

Harry.

&gt; down. I'm concerned about using an alarm that is triggered by voltage fluctuations.
&gt; Normally a voltage drop occurs when a door opens and the dome light comes on
&gt; and this will trigger the alarm. Based on your info, I'm wondering if the refrigerator
&gt; cooling fan will trigger the alarm when it comes on. This would be a problem.
