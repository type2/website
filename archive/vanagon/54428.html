OK, so a told everyone about my new heater.  My wife didn't seem to mind 
that I charged it (wow, why did I wait so long?).  Now I'm confused about 
bleeding the air from my coolant system.  Please, what's the consensus on 
the need to bleed the air out of the coolant system after installing the new 
heater core.  Yes I'm a novice, so be gentle.....   Also, since it's cold in 
Minnesota this time of year, do I really have to worry about the van 
overheating?  Seems like the cold weather should have some cooling affect on 
the van (it sure did before I put the new heater in).

Thanks in advance.
