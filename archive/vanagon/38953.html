If other gears work okay, you probably lost the 3-4 slider hub.  These are
very prone to cracking and failing.  Do not use van until fixed.  These
broken parts will wipe out rest of transmission making it unrepairable.  If
interested, I can rebuild this transmission for you.  I live on Long Island,
NY.  I now have many trans parts in stock for these units.
