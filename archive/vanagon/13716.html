Friends and neighbors,
	Unca Joel sent me a few pictures of his Vanagon which I finally
managed to get scanned in yesterday.  Also, Al Knoll faxed me a page with
some bumper-sticker suggestions on it, and that got scanned also.  They
can all be found at http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw.  I had to use
a different scanner than usual, so the scans are unfortunately not as
good as the last batch.  Maybe I'll have time to scan them again later (hah!).
