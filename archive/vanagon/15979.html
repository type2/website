Subject: Re: Interstate Batt--Deep Cycle Batt Found

Interstate came out tops in a Consumer Reports test a few years back so I'd
go with them. 

------------------------------

By the way folks, after a great deal of research I determined that the Exide
combination trolling/starting deep cycle marine battery size group 27 will
just barely fit in the place under the drivers seat as an auxiliary battery.
It has 160 mins reserve capacity and something like 700 marine caranking
amps. The &quot;Gold&quot; version of this group 27 size battery will not fit. Also,
group 27 sizes from other manufacturers usually won't fit although some might.

In order to stuff this monster in there you have to let it stick up about an
inch and you have to saw away the corner of the seat base or the driver's
seat won't be able to swivel. 

I am happy with the way it fits and would do it again. (In fact, I *am*
doing it again, as I used to do this with a Sears marine battery in my 87
camper that is now dead.)

Anyway, this Exide marine battery is the solution to stick a 2nd deep-cycle
battery in the vehicle. The sears deep cycle group 27s no longer fit as they
have a different design with recessed terminals now. 

I challenge anyone else on the list who has a Vanagon to see whether they
have solved the problem of mounting a large-sized deep-cycle battery in that
spot.  Nobody has? Right, I thought so.
