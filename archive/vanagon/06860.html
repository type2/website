&gt;&gt; This notice describes a one time opportunity for anyone who wants a killer
&gt;&gt; trailer hitch to get a Class III hitch. These are not otherwise available
&gt;
&gt;   Are there trailer hitches available for earlier vans -- particularly
&gt;my '73? Preferably with the receiver? This one sounds like it's only
&gt;for the vanagon, right?

there USED TO BE a hitch kit available from the dealer ... cause i bought one
for my old 1971 bus. it bolted to the frame (there are very large threaded
threaded holes already up under there) and was good for a tongue weight of
about 120 lbs. can't remember the towing weight.

you might check your frame and see if these holes are there (on the outside
of the rear frame members, about 1-2 feet forward of the bumper). if so,
you could get someone to weld up a hitch ... or check with u-haul/whoever-
rents-trailers and see what they have in their books.
