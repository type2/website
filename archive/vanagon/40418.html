&gt;But next time, I'm putting a Mazda rotary in it.

But WHY? Why do you keep mucking about? Why waste your time on piddly sh*t?

I mean, you can't really swing a dead cat without smacking one of those 501
cid Cadillac engines in a junkyard, and if you scrounged you could come up
with an old Cad V16.

If we're going to get rotten mileage, Steve, then let's do it up RIGHT! ;)
