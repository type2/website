&gt;      So, here is the question, what do I need to do in order to put a
&gt; Quantum TD into a Vanagon diesel? 

&gt;From my experience of using a '85 Quantum turbo, intake,and exhaust manifolds
on my '83 camper,  I would suggest the following would cover the significant
points:

1.)  Transfer your vanagon diesel oil pump pickup*, and oil pan to the td
engine.  Adapt or extend the turbo oil drain into the oil pan.  I drilled a 
hole in my vanagon oil pan and put an angle fitting for this connection. 
The object is to allow gravity to drain the oil exit at the bottom of the
turbo.
You will probably also use your vanagon valve cover, and oil dipstick.

*I would try to use the td oil pump, with the vanagon pickup if possible. 


2.) The turbo diesel boost enrichment attachement on the td injection pump 
will probably interfere with your engine cover.  For the vanagon the factory
solution 
was a different boost enrichment actuator than on the Quantum or Jetta
models.
Since it is diffiult to obtain in the U.S. you must either have a elevated
engine
cover to clear the boost enrichment actuator or you can run the td engine
with
your vanagon injection pump, which would reduce the td engines power.

I have been running mine for about two years with the vanagon inj pump, and
the fuel 
delivery tweaked up a little to take advantage of the boost, but I have been
thinking about finding a Td injection pump to get better fuel delivery
control.

3.)  You will need to get a muffler shop to fabricate from the turbo exit a
&quot;u&quot;
turn around the outside of the engine sound cover and connect to your
existing vanagon muffler.   I put a larger diameter system on at the same
time but would not reccomend as it has been troublesome with getting
a proper mounting that did not break muffler brackets.
 
4.)   Air intake plumbing,  I am not sure what the original Quantum TD pipes
look like but I think you will have to make a combination of hoses to connect
from the turbo inlet to your air filter.   Since the vanagon diesel air
filter won't
work, you may be able to mount the Quantum air filter housing in place of the
air intake elbow that leads up to the air vent on the driver's side of the
car.
I am using a round cannister type air filter with 90 deg elbows at each end.

One thing that I have found by experience is the engine intake noise is
extreme
without a long pipe going up to the air vent.  Any back seat passengers will 
complain when driving _at_ 65 on the freeway.



Well thats what I remember as the most signifcant items.  Based on my 
own experience, I think the improvement is worthwhile.  Hope this helps.
