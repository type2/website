Subject: Distinguishing _among_ 68-70 busses (was 'between' :^)

&gt;  To tell a '68 from a '69 I'm not so sure. I used to think that a '68 could
&gt;  be recognized by the lack of a metal partition between the engine compartment
&gt;  and gas tank &lt;you can see the tank from the engine hatch&gt;, but someone told
&gt;  me that some later '68s have the partition. There's always the VIN......
&gt; 
Isn't it also true that the '69's have rear defogger wires?  That was 
always a Q&amp;D way to differentiate w/o measuring cables, etc.
