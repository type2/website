Subject: 83 VANAGON FUEL/TEMP GUAGE ??

hello all! i'm a vanagon newbie who just purchased an '83 vanagon gl 
(waterpumper w/roof ac) and i have a question:

--&gt; the fuel and temperature guages are acting unusual. when i first 
purchased the van they didn't work at all. then a freind replaced 
something and they worked for a week. he's gone and now they're 
misbehaving again. the temp light constantly blinks and the guages 
barely register, even though i just filled the tank and the car has 
warmed up. (when they were working, they seemed ok). any tips? i'm 
waiting for my bentley.

thanks

tony
