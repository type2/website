Hi anyone who reads this.

I am female and YES I rebuilt my own motor (a mechanic friend sort of helped
me).  I had a 1600 in my 72 Kombi.  I bought an 88 kit.  Is there anytihng I
have to modify besides changing the barells etc.  The car is going pretty
good, but at first we thought there was something wrong with the thrust
bearing.  Now it seems there is play in the bottom pulley (I am not a
mechanic so please forgive the ignorance to part names :-)) When the car is
idling, the fanbelt (or the pulleys) make a hell of a racket.  My friend
told e what he thought it was (not a VW mechanic) so I would appreciate any
suggestions from some of you guys who know what is happening.

Thanks

Tracey
