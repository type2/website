Subject: In Flight cooling sys. Tech. Tip

       
        Here is a good technical tip!
       
       Here one for the record! I made a 4:00 am mad dash to work
       from my families cottage, about 2 hours drive. After the 
       first hour or so, I was into some major hills here in PA.
       Took a look at the temp. gauge and didn't know what to
       think? The gauge was in the white/cold area. OK ..Ok 
       I tried not to panic! I just came down a 1/2 mile hill 
       but maybe I lost the coolant? No time to stop and check 
       the coolant. What can I do for a in flight check? My next best 
       test was... Heat on full! If it was hot I had to have fluid, 
       and in most vehicles if you have a pressure loss the heat
       gets cold!
