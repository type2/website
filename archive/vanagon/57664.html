Subject: Vanagon fuel leak
Date: Wed, 26 Mar 97 14:23:22 EST

Hey all,
Filled up the Vanagon gas tank today (didn't realize I was so low on
gas, the tank has a dent in the bottom so the gauge stops right outside
the red zone -- It took about 13.7 gal in a 16-gal tank) and drove home.
When I got out of the van, I smelled gas, so looked down to investigate
and sure enough, right as I looked I saw a drop hit the ground, smelled
the liquid and it was gas.  

My first thought was &quot;aw sh*t, I gotta drop the tank&quot; but further
inspection showed that the only thing leaking was one of the rubber
cloth-covered hoses that leads to the vent tank in the driver's wheel
well.  That one hose was soaked with gas while the others were dry, and
I didn't see any leaking on the passenger side.

So, I have to replace one hose.  No big deal, it's in plain view and I'm
happy.  The question is what size is the hose?  Looks like about 7mm.

The second question, mainly for Steve and Tom, is do either of you have
a section of that hose laying around that you wouldn't mind donating?  

I've got some, but of course it's at home in Tennessee and I am not.

Any help is appreciated.

Sean
