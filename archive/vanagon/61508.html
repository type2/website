Subject: Re: Where to keep my buds??

&gt; &gt;Anyway, I once had a lovely bud vase (which was an option on the Type
&gt; &gt;II) for putting fresh flowers on the dash (were you expecting
&gt; &gt;otherwise?) and I'm now wondering if anyone has seen a more modern (but
&gt; &gt;still attractive) substitute for Happy?
&gt; 
&gt; I bought a pair of lovely 'modern' bud vases for Beethoven from Joe Gunyan
&gt; on Long Island, NY.  He produces cut crystal vases for approx $75 apiece.
&gt; They're very classy.

		Martha Stewart uses these in her bus as well.
		After all, what would the society girls say if she
		used, say, Budweiser cans chopped in half.
