I would appreciate a hamburger today and gladly pay for it on Monday. ;)

&gt;All,
&gt;
&gt;I am looking for a camper, pre vanagon era(not that I have anything
&gt;against Vanagons, I just don't want one).  I need the body/pan to be
&gt;in good condition, condition of motor(or lack thereof) is not that
&gt;important, nor is the condition of the interior(I only ask that the
&gt;components be there, and in a condition that can be fixed, rather than
&gt;pitched), it needs to be within reasonable distance of Austin,Texas
&gt;(3/4 of a day drive- 1 day drive), and can be towed(I don't want to
&gt;purchase tires, just to get it home, and (as if that wasn't enough) it
&gt;needs to be cheap, I could probably weasle $700 out of the wife, but
&gt;I would have to pay for it later :-O
&gt;
&gt;Any leads would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, I am looking for a pop-top camper, not a weekender version.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
