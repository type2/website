Subject: cruel trick to play on you're SO
Date: Sat, 6 Jan 1996 10:42:58 -0800 (PST)


Apology in advance:  For the next week or so, I won't be able to talk
about anything other than barndoor busses....

My SO did the &quot;Girl Thing&quot; last night, while I stayed home and some
of the local &quot;Bus Guys&quot; came over to look at the pics of my '54,
pics of another guy's '55 panel, pics of yet someone else's '55
Deluxe, and the '55 non-barndoor camper I'd found.  Within a matter
of a week, there will be 5 barndoors in the Sacramento area!
('54 kombi, '55 panel, '55 deluxe, '54 RHD deluxe, '54 single cab)

So she ended up coming in quite late, and slept in while I got up 
and puttered around the house.

I went in a couple hours later to see how she was doing, and she was
still quite groggy.  I snuggled up next to her, and started whispering
things like &quot;I want you so bad I can taste it&quot;  &quot;I can't wait till I
can ride you&quot;  &quot;Your the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyee on&quot;
and so on.  Well, this got her attention all right, but what she didn't 
realize what I was looking thru the pictures I got yesterday of the '54...

I let this go on for a few minutes, and let one of the pix drop onto the bed,
and the jig was up.  Good thing I was fully clothed (protected) or she
prolly woulda Bobbitized me!
