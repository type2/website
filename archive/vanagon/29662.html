Subject: portland pizza bash ???

    Okay, I'll give it another try: I'll be in Portland on sunday, Dec3,
'cause I'll catch the plane monday morning to go to Germany for a couple
of weeks. And I was wondering if anyone is interested in meeting for beer and
pizza, like the Bay area folks always do. Probably won't burn any engine
cases this time (actually, who knows ...) but it might be fun anyways...
  Any takers ???

                    Gregor
