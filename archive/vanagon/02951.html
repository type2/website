Subject: Camping Opportunity (1/2, long)

A colleague made me aware of this and I thought some of you would want to 
know and maybe go:

FREEDOM RIDGE/TIKABOO PEAK FREE-SPEECH ENCAMPMENT
AUGUST 27-28, 1994, STARTING NOON SATURDAY

CONTACT:  psychospy_at_aol_dot_com or 702-729-2648

Everyone in the world is invited to a free camp-out on Freedom 
Ridge on Aug. 27-28, 1994.  Come see the military base that 
doesn't exist from a legal viewpoint on public land.  This land is 
being sought by the Air Force and may be closed before the end of 
the year, so this is a good chance to catch a glimpse of the 
secret Groom Lake base at &quot;Area 51&quot; while the weather is still 
warm enough for camping.

Below are the details for this event.  Please follow this advice 
to assure a safe and legal trip.

 ----- DISCLAIMER ----- 

This is a loosely organized get-together of interested citizens.  
A schedule of events is suggested, but people can do whatever they 
want.  The organizers of this event accept no liability whatsoever 
for any loss or injury.  You are responsible for your own safety 
and for understanding the rules and risks of the place you are 
visiting.  In this document, we have tried our best to give you 
the information you'll need to enjoy this event safely, but we 
accept no liability if any information is omitted or in error.

 ----- GENERAL PLAN ----- 

We will meet at 12 noon (PDT) on Saturday at the Freedom Ridge 
trailhead.  (See directions below.)  After a briefing, we will 
proceed to the top by foot or four wheel drive.  We will set up 
camp, build a campfire and spend the night on the ridge.  The next 
day, people who are interested (and in good shape) can hike 
Tikaboo Peak, the higher and farther viewpoint that will remain 
open even if the Air Force closes Freedom Ridge.

If there is enough interest, an event similar to this one (but 
much smaller) may also be held Sept. 3-4.  Contact the Encampment 
Coordinator for more info.

 ----- OTHER OPTIONS ----- 

People can feel free to come and go on any schedule they choose.  
For those who cannot arrive by noon, our cars will be easy to find 
and the trail is clearly marked.  Look for instructions posted on 
one of the cars.

Those who don't want to spend the night on the ridge will have 
plenty of time to hike down before dark.  They can camp near the 
road (where it is easier to pitch a tent) or spend the night at a 
motel in Rachel or Alamo.  (Rooms are limited so reservations are 
essential--see phone numbers below.)  It is legal to camp anywhere 
on public land without a permit as long as you clean up after 
yourself.

If you arrive on Sunday and don't find our cars at the trailhead, 
look for instructions posted nearby.  Some people will probably go 
to the Little A-Le-Inn in Rachel for breakfast or lunch.   The 
outing is expected to disperse on Sunday, with only a few people 
making the hike to Tikaboo Peak.  

Since the Tikaboo Peak hike requires further instructions, you 
should contact the Encampment Coordinator if you plan to arrive on 
Sunday.

 ----- LOCATION ----- 

Freedom Ridge is a hill next to the border of the Nellis Air Force 
Range about 12 miles west of the Groom Lake air base.  The base 
can be plainly seen from this distance, but you will need 
binoculars or a telescope for the best view.

Freedom Ridge is located about 140 road miles north of Las Vegas.  
The nearest towns are Rachel and Alamo.  The terrain is scrub 
desert at an elevation of 5000 feet.  Due to the high elevation, 
the August weather is relatively mild, with daytime highs in the 
90s and nighttime lows in the 50s.

The summit of Freedom Ridge can be reached by a moderately 
challenging 50-minute hike from a well-maintained dirt road.  The 
trail is marked by ribbons tied around Joshua trees.  Any vehicle 
can easily make it to the trailhead.  The summit can also be 
reached by a very rugged four wheel drive road taking a different 
route; for this you will need additional instructions.

 ----- HOW TO GET THERE ----- 

The Freedom Ridge trailhead is about 2-1/2 hours north of Las 
Vegas (or 2-1/2 hours east of Tonopah).  From Las Vegas, go north 
on I-15 about 20 miles to US-93 at Exit 64.  Go north on US-93 
about 85 miles to SR-375.  Take SR-375 (not SR-318) west 15 miles 
until you reach the big dirt road to Groom Lake at milepost 34.6.  
(It is marked by a stop sign and maybe also a &quot;THIS WAY TO SECRET 
BASE&quot; sign.)  This is a good dirt road that any car can handle.  
Take the dirt road west 13.6 miles until you see our cars parked 
beside a &quot;Keep Right&quot; sign.  DO NOT DRIVE PAST THE WELL-MARKED 
MILITARY BORDER JUST BEYOND.  Try to park off the road or as far 
to the right as you can.

The best place to shop for supplies is Las Vegas.  (Try Sahara 
Ave., west of I-15.)  Gas up there, too.  There is no gas or 
groceries between Las Vegas and Alamo.  Last gas before Freedom 
Ridge is at Ash Springs (or at Rachel).

 ----- RISKS ----- 

 -- The greatest danger in this area is wandering across the well-
guarded military border, which is immediately adjacent to Freedom 
Ridge and the hiking trail.  The border is marked by orange posts 
every 50 yards and stainless steel balls on posts every quarter 
mile.  There is no fence.  Wherever a road crosses the border, it 
is marked by clear Restricted Area signs but no gate or guard 
house.

People who are caught on the other side of the border are 
immediately arrested.  Bail of $600 cash is required to spring you 
from jail, AND THERE ARE NO ATMs IN THE COUNTY.  You will be 
required to appear in court at a later date, and the fine is 
usually $300 to $600.

Because the orange posts and trail markers are almost invisible at 
night, it is unwise to hike after dark.

 -- Nasty desert critters, like rattlesnakes, are rare here, but 
you should still be careful where you walk and put your hands.  
Snakes will do their best to stay out of your way if you give them 
a chance.

 -- Gas is a available at only a few widely separated locations:  
Las Vegas, Alamo, Ash Springs and Rachel.  Be sure to come to the 
area with a full tank of gas.  The Ash Springs gas station is open 
24 hours.  Rachel's is open only 7am-7pm.

 -- Cars can easily get stuck in the sand or on rocks on 
unmaintained dirt roads.  Stay on the maintained dirt road unless 
you have a four wheel drive.

 -- Bring plenty of drinks.  In this high altitude desert, you can 
get dehydrated quickly.

 -- Lightning can be a danger in the unlikely event of 
thunderstorms.  If there is any hint of thunder clouds, it is 
important to keep well below the top of the ridge.

 -- The 50-minute, 1 mile hike can be moderately challenging, but 
shouldn't be much trouble for most people.  The vertical distance 
traveled is only about 500 feet, but the high elevation makes it 
much more tiring than at sea level.  People who are seriously out 
of shape should think twice about hiking.

 -- When driving in this area, cattle in the road are a serious 
danger.  Cattle are unfenced and wander freely across the highway.  
Drive slowly at night.  If you hit a cow, you are required by law 
to report it to the Sheriff or the rancher.

 ----- EQUIPMENT NEEDED ----- 

 -- Given the short length of our stay, tents are not necessary.  
All you'll need is a sleeping bag and a tarp or piece of plastic 
for a ground cover.  You should also bring enough plastic to cover 
yourself in the unlikely event of rain.  (When rainstorms come, 
they are usually brief.)  The summit is rocky, but just below the 
top there are sandy patches big enough for a person to lie down 
on.

 -- Two quarts of water per person is advised.  You should carry 
more in your car.

 -- You'll need only enough food for a couple of meals.  For 
sentimental reasons, military MREs are the preferred ration.  
(They are usually sold in Army-Navy stores.)

 -- Wear short pants and light clothing for the hike, which can be 
hot.  It is also a good idea to bring a sweatshirt and long pants 
for when the temperature falls at night.

 -- Binoculars or a telescope are important for viewing the base 
and the sky.  There is no legal limit to size and magnification.

 -- Remember to bring a flashlight.

 -- For people who have CB radios, Channel 15 will be the one to 
monitor.  (It's &quot;51&quot; backwards.)

 -- A lawn chair is a traditional convenience if you can easily 
carry one.

You probably won't need much beyond these items.  You should come 
prepared to carry all of your own equipment to the top, but people 
with four wheel drives may be willing to carry it for you.

 ----- SANITATION ----- 

&quot;Powder room&quot; opportunities will be limited, especially before 
dark.  A primitive latrine will be erected at the summit of 
Freedom Ridge, but it won't be pretty.  An RV with a simple toilet 
will be available at the trailhead.  The gentlemen shouldn't have 
much difficulty finding discrete locations, but the ladies must 
plan ahead and take advantage of their opportunities.  Away from 
the ridge, all of Nevada is at your disposal.

 ----- EXPECTATIONS ----- 

Some people may be disappointed by the view from Freedom Ridge.  
What you see in the distance appears to be an ordinary Air Force 
base--albeit a very large one--beside a dry lake bed.  No flying 
saucer bases or underground cities are evident.  On weekends, the 
base is usually very quiet, with almost no aircraft or vehicle 
traffic.  Since this camp-out has been well publicized, you should 
not expect to see any secret craft--be it earthly or alien.  The 
main satisfaction is derived from the fact that this base &quot;isn't 
there&quot; officially.

 ----- SECURITY ----- 

The border area is actively patrolled by an anonymous force of 
security guards wearing camouflage fatigues and driving white Jeep 
Cherokees.  These &quot;Cammo Dudes&quot; watch Freedom Ridge with high 
power binoculars and video cameras that are capable of reading car 
license plates from a mile away.  These guards are under orders to 
avoid contact with visitors (unless you cross the border).  If 
they feel you have violated a law on public land, they will call 
the Lincoln County Sheriff to investigate.  In this open terrain, 
the Sheriff can be seen coming from miles away.  One of the radio 
frequencies for the Sheriff is 154.86 MHz.  The radio frequencies 
for the security patrols are usually scrambled; they include 
418.05, 408.4, 142.2, 170.5 and 138.3.

Be aware that the security patrols may record your license plate 
numbers and will probably run those numbers for identification.

 ----- FREE-SPEECH PROTEST (OPTIONAL) ----- 

According to a 1948 federal law (18 USC 795), it is illegal to 
take or publish photographs of any military installation 
designated by the President as requiring such protection.  Signs 
at the border warn against photography here, but this hasn't 
stopped photos of the base from showing up in many major 
periodicals and TV shows.  No one has ever been prosecuted for 
photographing the base or publishing these pictures, even when 
they admitted taking them, but many innocent visitors have lost 
their film and equipment to authorities who claimed they were 
enforcing this regulation.

Many video tapes and rolls of film have been seized by the Lincoln 
County Sheriff's Dept., which has a service contract with the Air 
Force.  Film has been confiscated indiscriminately from anyone 
seen near the border, whether or not they were near a place where 
the secret base could be seen.  Once taken, the film is turned 
over to the anonymous authorities at the base.  Regardless of what 
the film shows, it &quot;vanishes&quot; and is rarely returned or accounted 
for.

Along with countless private citizens, news crews from ABC News 
and KNBC-TV have had their video tape confiscated, along with some 
equipment.  ABC News eventually got their tape and equipment back, 
but KNBC-TV and most others have not.  The irony is, because it is 
easy to see the Sheriff coming, only the innocent ever lose their 
film.  People who intend to photograph the base are careful enough 
to not be seen, and they take the obvious precautions with their 
film.

To protest the arbitrary seizing of film from visitors and the 
withholding of it without due process, we will be conducting a 
&quot;Freedom Ridge Camera and Video Show&quot; to coincide with the camp-
out.  Participants are invited to bring cameras and display them 
proudly on the ridge.  The &quot;cameras&quot; do not have to be functional 
or real, and to avoid the charge of inciting a federal crime, we 
cannot recommend that you bring film or video tape.

It may or may not be illegal to photograph the nonexistent base, 
but there is nothing illegal (that we can tell) about simply 
having a camera on the ridge or even pointing it at the base.  If 
some people have film in their cameras, that is their choice, and 
they are taking their own risk.  The Sheriff or an army of FBI 
agents could raid the camp-out to seize this film, but it would 
require a lot of manpower to do it, and the raid itself would 
create a compelling news story and result in a lot of interesting 
pictures.

The aim of this protest is to secure the return of all film and 
video tape that has been confiscated without warrant and not 
returned.  If any film must be seized for national security 
reasons, then a hearing or appeal process must be provided to the 
victim to assure &quot;due process.&quot;  We also want the Air Force to 
make public a definition of exactly what areas, by presidential 
order, cannot be photographed, so that citizens have enough 
information to obey.

But realistically...  What we hope to gain by this protest is to 
separate the Sheriff's Dept. from the Air Force, to make it beyond 
the means of this local police force to play the front man for the 
secret base in enforcing this antiquated law.  If the Air Force 
wants film confiscated, then it must identify itself as the 
complainant and find its own means of enforcement through open 
channels.

If you choose to take part in this protest (It is entirely 
voluntary.), then you must be prepared to accept your own 
responsibility for whatever happens to you or your equipment.  In 
all likelihood, there will be no confrontation--The authorities 
would have to be really dumb.--but if there is, at least you will 
have the company of others.

Your &quot;camera&quot; should be displayed only in the company of the 
group, since our strength lies in numbers.  If, by chance, you are 
stopped by the Sheriff and asked any question about photography, 
you should politely decline to provide any information and not 
turn over any of your property without a warrant.  You also should 
not reveal to your fellow campers whether or not you have film in 
your camera, since there could be spies among us.  (They're 
invited, too!)
