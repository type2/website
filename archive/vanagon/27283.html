&gt;&gt;WOw I am so happy to hear you are getting you piston slap fixed. I 
have
&gt;&gt;a '93 EV and my warranty that is out of milage.  Please send me all
&gt;&gt;practical info in how you got the piston thing fixed and also the
&gt;&gt;number of your dealer and the mechanic, and also more info on the
&gt;&gt;window thing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    Thank you Elliot
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Elliot,
&gt;
&gt;Just talked to my dealer rep, seems they got a bad head gasket and 
need to
&gt;reorder. The van won't be ready until mid-week.
&gt;
&gt;About the only practical info I have for you on this piston slap thing 
is
&gt;that I heard about here on the mailing list and it seemed to apply to 
my
&gt;car. What I'd heard is that piston slap makes a metallic clattering 
sound
&gt;for about 20 seconds after starting a cold engine. It sounds kind of 
like a
&gt;diesel enging starting.
&gt;
&gt;The only way to confirm this is to take it to the dealer, park it
&gt;overnight, and let them check it out the next morning (cold
&gt;engine--remember?)
&gt;
&gt;Also, the warranty I'm talking about is the 5 yr/50,000 mile power 
train
&gt;warranty, not the bumper to bumper 2 yr/24,000 mile warranty. If you 
have
&gt;under 50,000 miles on your car, it's still covered!
&gt;
&gt;The dealer I'm working with is Carter's in Seattle (206) 782-7474. My
&gt;service rep is Todd. Good guy. I'm very pleased with the service I've
&gt;received so far.
&gt;
&gt;Another point of contact is a salesman that works there named Jim 
Tandoo.
&gt;He only works Thursday through Saturday though. I don't usually like
&gt;salesmen,  but this guy is different. He used to run a VW garage, 
knows VWs
&gt;inside and out, and is one heck of a nice guy. Give him a call if you 
have
&gt;any questions and tell him Jeff DeLeeuw sent you.
&gt;
&gt;Can't tell you much about the window thing. There was a recall on some
&gt;power window components, my dealer told me about it after they'd fixed 
it.
&gt;All I know is that before, lowering the windows made a fairly loud 
clunk
&gt;when they hit bottom. Now they don't do that anymore. Not sure what 
they
&gt;replaced.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,
&gt;
&gt;Jeff
&gt;
