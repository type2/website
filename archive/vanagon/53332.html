&gt; What aftermarket cruise control systems have you installed in your
vanagons?

Zemco.  I've installed several in various VWs including two 87 Vanagons.

&gt;  Who did you buy it from?

JCWhitney

&gt;  What model?

Unsure, but it's basically a little rectangular box style, not the stalk
style.  I mounted it on top of the steering column cover between the steering
wheel and the gauges.  Very handy placement.

&gt;  How well does it perform?

Well for years, but it's been acting up recently.  I think I found the
problem, a loose vacuum line, but I have not confirmed yet.

&gt;  Any recommendations?

Don't even attempt to get a Zemco.  They've gone out of business.  I was
suprised to find this out after being pleased with their products several
times.

&gt;  I've got an 87 syncro van.  I've looked at some of the JHW systems, but 
&gt;  would like to get a recommendation from a listmember.

I suppose you mean JCWhitney?  I can't recommend a specific brand, but if I
were buying one today, I'd definitely get the same style as mine (the little
rectangular box) since it can be mounted in such a handy location and almost
looks as if it belongs there.  The thought of mounting one of the turn signal
stalk ones on the Vanagon's stalk leaves me cold.

Good luck,
