EPA has an auto fax system (202 233-9660) which will fax you the 
information and forms needed to import a vehicle.  Apparently, for 
Canadian vehicles, there is a &quot;list&quot; of vehicles which are certified as 
&quot;identical&quot; to US specs (I'm referring to the EPA declaration code EE 
on the form if you get it).  It also states that &quot;all 1988-1995 model 
years cars and light trucks (gas and diesel) are on this list. 
Reminder-this list refers to Canadian vehicles only, so don't even 
THINK about bringing a late model vehicle from Europe over, unless you 
have lots of cash. The instructions with the form are pretty good, I 
encourage anyone interested in importing a vehicle, be it Canada or 
Europe, to give the number a call and get the form. DOT is another 
matter...the regs for DOT differ slightly, but I never got info on late 
model vehicles.  Their general information number is 202-366-5286.  I 
believe these two agencies (along with US Customs) are the only ones 
you need to deal with as far as the regulations. My wife also happens 
to be Canadian, which gives us even more options!  If anyone doesn't 
have access to a fax machine, I can mail you a copy of these forms if 
you e-mail me directly.    Good luck!
