Subject: Pillow Support for Westy

Listees,

I have wanted to post this for quite a while and finally have time.  What
is the collective wisdom to hold pillows (prevent them falling) from the
top bunk of a Westy?

We have tried the following:
1.  Sleep with head to low end of roof - uncomfortable.
2.  Velcro on corners of pillow attached to velcro on fitted sheet -
prevents snuggling and bunching of the pillow.
3.  Turning the fitted sheet head end upwards to wrap around the pillow -
makes the top bunk a little too short.
4.  Creating a net attached along the bunk head and about 300mm high held
verticle by two strings running up to the roof support frame - hard to
climb up and down over the net.
5.  Sleep on the lower bunk where you can reach over and pick up the pillow
- miss out on the sounds of nature!
6.  Make a long pillow the same width as the bunk and rely on my wife to be
the anchor - works fine most times but when it does fall the result is two
people awake!

I am expecting some wisecracks about my being a hopeless sleeper, but after
hearing about the way the lower bunk can create a back rest for early
morning reading and tea/coffee I am prepared to take the flack to be sure
that I do not miss out on a brilliant solution!

BTW we have a great solution to having a radio accessible from the top bunk
- we have two wire hooks that go over the horizontal support tube of the
roof support and onto the handle of the radio.  There is room for the
aerial to be extended and a semi conscious arm can reach all the controls!

Soooo fire away!
