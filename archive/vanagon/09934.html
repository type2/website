Subject: ORAPOST bad messages.

Well, I've done a little exploring into the 100s of bad messages posted 
to the list, and I've found something amazing! The person whose mailer 
blew up on us is from Lichtenstein.  So, with much sadness, I'm forced to 
remove from the list people from a very tiny country.  I feel like such a 
bully, but what can I do?
