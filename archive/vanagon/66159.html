Subject:      price check on 85 westie

&gt;&gt;The body is not perfect but very good with only a spot here or there,
no seams etc.  My question is how does $6200 sound for it?

I bought my '85 Westie here in Seattle 3 months ago for $5200. It had
110,000 miles on it with a recently replaced engine. Interrior is great,
exterrior fair. I think I got a good deal.

&gt;&gt; One negative is that I found a bottle of cheap coolant in one of the
cabinets.  It had phosphate (sp?)in it.

I would put some money in a savings account earmarked for
replacing/rebuilding the engine. Regardless of what type coolant was
used, there is a pretty good chance that an engine with almost 100K
miles on it will need some TLC. Hopefully I'll be wrong and your money
will quietly earn interest.

&gt;&gt; The interior is very nice and it drives ok ( alot slower than an 86
auto though, is that normal?).

My Westie is an auto as well and it is ok on the flats but going up
hills it lacks any real power. I have to go over passes at 40 with the
gas pedal floored. I always assumed this was normal. Resist the
temptation to drive fast and you will save your engine undue stress. My
normal highway speed is 60. I want to buy one of those bumper stickers
that says &quot;Too slow? Too bad.&quot;

In all, $6200 is a pretty good price for a vehicle that can drive you
and house you anywhere.

Good luck.
