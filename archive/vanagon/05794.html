Subject: Tranny oil


&gt;   any particular reason? i've wondered about changing the transmission fluid
&gt;   every year, but decided that with so many cars still running around that have
&gt;   NEVER changed their tranny oil, it would be ok to continue at every two years.
&gt;   i'm almost paranoid enough to change brake fluid and coolant at one year
&gt;   (instead of two) ... almost. not quite. :)

When we lived in Pittsburgh, I befriended a real nice fella named Mitch.  Those
of you who live around Pittsburgh may know him -- he owns the shop called
Volkswagen Haven.  He had quite a setup where he rebuilt VWs from scratch --
he had a 4-story building full of chopped up VW parts.
It was a respectable size business even then, almost a decade ago.  I once
asked him why he never bothered to change the tranny oil -- he would
change everything else.  He told me that he has yet to see a transmission
broken down because of bad oil.  According to Mitch, the only way a VW tranny
will go bad is if it gets low on oil. Otherwise, he said, it will last
forever, with the original fill of oil in it.

I hope he's right -- I never bother to change the tranny oil in my vehicles.

BTW, Joel, what sounds are we supposed to make when we drive model diesel
     Westy's??? Clatter-clatter-clickety-clack-put-put-put-vrooooom?
     (Hey, it's Friday, what do you expect?????).... :-)
