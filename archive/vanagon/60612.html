&gt;Subject: EV Transmission Preference
&gt;
&gt;Could the T4/Eurovan/Caravelle owners on the list who have the 2.5 litre
&gt;engine let me know their preference for manual or automatic transmissions?
&gt;(especially in terms of derivability and service.)
&gt;

I think with the smaller engine the manual is preferable. Several quick
gear changes to get up to 50, but you can control the shifting. (I've heard
the automatic tends to &quot;drift&quot; a bit but I don't have personal experience
there.)
Engine cam has been tuned for this gearing so you get *relatively* good
acceleration, but it's nice to have that 5th gear overdrive at 65+ speeds.

&gt;IMHO, I like automatics, but maybe a manual transmission is the way to get
&gt;the most out of the available horsepower.
&gt;

Personally I think manual's are simpler, hence less of a maintenance issue,
but automatics are built pretty strongly these days. And you don't have a
clutch to replace. (But I've got over 90K on my Volvo clutch without
replacement.)

Note that '97 model in the US has only automatic transmission.

&gt; (And I have 16 gears on my Moulton ;{&gt;   )
Does it have an 8x2? I guess road bikes are up to 9x2 now, but I have mine
setup 8x3 using mtb components. Gives me a real granny gear!
