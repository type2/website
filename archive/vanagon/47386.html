Subject: Reply to: To use Thermostat or not?

Jonathan,
Whatever you've heard about it being good not to have it is BS.  Get your thermostat, hook it up, make sure it works, and your engine will love you forever.  It warms up quicker, so you get less cold-engine wear, making your engine last much longer, which is the point of a rebuild anyway :)

Put it in.

Sean
