Ok, folks ready for today's installment of &quot;Stalling Vanagon&quot;?  (You might
remember I'm the guy with a 1991 Multivan that stops running after driving
for 20 minutes and won't restart until it cools off for another 20 minutes
or so.) 

Left work during lunch and picked up a coolant temperature sensor and
O-ring from VW dealer.  (Cost was only $11.  I was expecting $35!!)  My
plan was to steal back my Vanagon from my mechanic on Saturday and install
the temp sensor myself.

Called my mechanic later from work and he told me had &quot;found the problem
for sure this time&quot;.  Said it was the ignition coil.  Said it had orange
spark on the plugs when it should have had blue.  I said, &quot;Great, I'll come
pick it up after work.&quot;

I fully expected my van to die on the way home like it did on Wednesday
when he had &quot;found the problem for sure this time&quot;.  Well, it DID NOT die
on th way home.  I even drove around for an extra half hour just to make
sure.  It never died!

Now the question for the panel?  Does anyone think that a bad ignition coil
could have caused my Vanagon to die in the way I have been describing the
past week?

I'm still skeptical.  I feel like I have been betrayed by a loved one.  It
is going to take a long time to rebuild the trust.
