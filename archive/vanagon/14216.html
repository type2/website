Red Rock Trip Report Part 2 - The Camp Site 

I took a long look at the stylish VWs that stood at the foot of a
ridge formed by 10,000 years of wind, rain and erosion.  I thought,
what a fitting sight for an ambush.  I drove into my spot that I
paid for and shut down a greatful purring machine that faithfully
carried me to this place with no complaint.  Maybe it knew too, that
I had some purpose in being here.  

I slid out of my '91 GL and immediately felt the biting cold of
wind that traversed several thousand miles to sting the bare skin
of my hands and face.  I cautiously approached the other VWs and
and noticed the panaramic view around me.  Miles and miles of 
sage brush and rock formations and jutting rock that looked as
though it burst from the earth just recently to escape the agony
of being held down for so many millenia only to stop and gaze
at the sun in frozen astonishment.  

Just then the door of the '81 Westfalia slid open and a carefully
laid foot hit the ground followed by another.  He was a tall man
with loose fitting pants and a dark brown sweater and he walked
with kind of slight saunter.  I could tell by the look in his 
dark eyes that he was no ordinary being.  We walked up to each
other and hesitated just for an instant.  But in that instant
I could see that he had many years of life in him and that there
was untold knowledge that could spin many tales of adventure and
intrigue.  We exchanged a short greeting and then he held up a
bag that could be only described as thick cellophane and he
uttered, &quot;Would you like a prune drop?&quot;  

I froze as he held out the small cellophane candy and I knew 
exactly what was hidden inside.  I could only surmise that this
was some kind of trick and I would have to think of a polite
but honorable way to refuse.  I said, &quot;No.&quot;  

There was a tense moment, but then gratefully he offered me 
a beer.  I thought for a nanosecond and said, &quot;O.K.&quot;

He pointed to an red ice chest up the grade and said, &quot;They're
over there.&quot; and paused for moment and snickered, &quot;Well, I'm
not gonna get it for ya.&quot; 

Another man and woman stepped out of the '81 and greeted me 
as a guest and we talked of friends we knew and who would be
arriving later.  A small dark dog skiddered out of the van
and whimpered like it was just told to step in front of a 
speeding car or die. 

The man with the prune drops, I'll call him Bradley for short,
and I were able to view the ranger station from the site and
could distinguish the sought after vehicles that would be
arriving later.  We observed an orange bay window or 'brick'
VW that might be with our party.

We decided to sit in the van and we talked of strange things
and about people on 'the list' that were going to be there
as well as those that were too meek to make the trip.  Mean-
while a shiny orange '72 Westfalia steadily made it's way
into one of the designated sites for our group.  We all sat 
in the van and just kind of waited in heavy antispation.
There was some snickering and chuckling and someone said,
&quot;We should just stay in here and let the person in the other
approaching van come to us.&quot;  After a few minutes, Bradley and
I jumped out of the van and approached the newcomer.

We walked up to the man who stepped out of the orange beauty
and noticed that he must be drunk even though Bradley and I
were the ones with the beers in our hands.  We exchanged 
greetings and strolled back to the van we came from and climbed
in.  He was offered a beer and said his name was Jack Stafford
and we then knew, for sure, that he was one of us.  We had a
good feeling about this trip.  As a matter of fact, I think
we all had a good feeling about everything at that point.

Two more vehicles rolled into the campsite.  Another cream 
'82 Westfalia and then a '73 Blue Safari.  Out of the '82
jumped a tall heathly man and a lovely lady.  They introduced
themselves as Scott Harvey and Alice ---- .  They were
friendly and amiable and showed no malice.  They had a 
golden retriever that showed a real passion for a scratch
behind the ear.  

A man stepped out of the Blue Safari and I immediately new
him as the Schwarze-miester.  He opened his van and from
it he pulled out a cardboard box that was about 2 and 1/2
feet long by about 2 and 1/2 inches squared and said that
it's contents was a shower curtain for privacy.  As the words 
left his lips the first woman, who is Martha, swooned with 
excitement and snatched the prize from the Schwarze-miesters 
hands and immediately expelled many words of praise and 
described extravagant plans on constructing a palace for 
exquisite bathing and sanitizing.  A place where one could 
become whole again.  We pleaded with Martha that this was 
a camping trip and that a few days of grunge would be 
acceptable and that the shower at the end of the trip 
would be a reward in and of itself worth waiting for.  
But she would not listen and instigated our help in trying 
to construct this proposed paradise.

Meanwhile more vans of the VW persuasion arrived including
another early vintage make of Vanagon with the same cream
colored paint that covered the other two Vanagons.   A
man and a woman stepped out of this van and two lovely 
children whose names have escaped me.  The woman introduced
herself to the rest of us as Alice Gibb and the man as
Larry McPhee.  We exchanged more greetings and discussed
who was here and who was expected to come.  We also talked
of our travels and where we came.

Another vehicle came into view which caught my eye like a
fish in a net.  It was a '59 pickup.  I gasped as it rolled
into our camp ground and could barely contain myself.  It
was restoration project beauty.  Hardly any rust anywhere.
Minor dents and two open holes in the rear where the original
brake lights had been.  Two completely different type brake
lights had been shamelessly stuck in below the holes which
I was told later by it's current owner, Bob Kenyon, that it 
came that way when he bought it. Bob Kenyon stepped out of
the van with another man and they introduced themselves and
the other mans name was Al.  I learned later on in the trip
that Al did amazing thing with vehicles that would net 
incredible amounts of horsepower.

As we were talking I could see at the ranger station yet another
of the expected in our party.  I recognized a faded red '70
Westfalia and new immediately that it was Sam and Susie Williams.
They eventually drove the trek around the park and took a spot
down the grade on the opposite side of the drive from my camping
spot.  They looked like they had a long trip but were ready for
whatever was to happen and greeted everyone warmly.     

I was still drooling over the '59 which probably made my '91
jealous but I couldn't help myself.  It was so straight for what
had obviously been used as a workhorse.  Bob and I discussed it
at length and I knew in the back of my mind that someday I
would not be able to hold back and would acquire one of these
beauties without a second thought.  Until that time I would
have to wait.....

After a time, a brown Oldsmobile station wagon pulled up and
a man with two early teenage children got out of the wagon
and introduced themselves as David, Nickie (sp?) and Sienna (sp?)
Kautz.  David explained to those that were not aware of the
problem he had with the bits of metal in his last oil change
and so decided that he would not drive has prized '85 to
this gathering.

Several of the people had mountain bikes with them and proceeded
to do some exploring while others sat and talked and exchanged
stories of their travels.  Others set up their campers and tents
so that they would be ready for retiring when they needed to.

Finally another older bay window with faded tan paint was noticed
at the ranger station and as it pulled around we knew it must
be the one expected member from Arizona.  It was David Phillips.
He pulled into the site and parked his faithful '68 bus and
hopped out and introduced himself and explained that he had
traveled since 4:00AM from Tucson against strong winds the
whole way.  

So now everyone expected in the party had arrived.  Everyone
commented on how cold it was always with an almost imperceptive 
glance at the Schwarze-miester.  I don't know if he noticed this 
but I was keenly aware and knew that if he did, he bode it well
and kept up an oblivious look on his face.  That look might have
been from the copious amounts of beer being inhaled, but I couldn't
tell for sure. 

As it was approaching the evening, everyone started to prepare for
the first feast and so hauled out their groceries and started to
prepare the food as needed.  My contribution for that evening was 
a veggie dish which was chopped carrots and celery.  Others brought
chili which was Jack Staffords contribution which was excellent.
Scott/Alice brought a delicious green salad.  Alice and Larry put 
out great tasting corn muffins that went great with the chili.  I 
do not recall who brought what for the rest of the main meal but it 
was great none the less.  And to top it all off, the Schwarze-
miester made strawberry shortcake that was above and beyond the call 
of excellent desserts. 

As the evening progressed and the beer was consumed in mass quantities
thing began to blur together.  The fire was warm and yet my
ass would freeze, so we'd have to rotate ourselves so that all
sides could enjoy the warmth.  All this done with a casual leer
in the Schwarze-miesters direction.  Marshmellows were passed and
roasted on a special implement that Martha had purchased for just 
such an occasion.

The Schwarze-miester, Martha, and Bradley (pruneman) commenced arranging
their vans into a square formation.  During the moving of vehicle
to this arrangement the Schwarze-miester in a blaze of glory plummeted
one of the site boundary posts mercilessly with the back bumper of
his Safari.  Everyone pretended not to notice, but then, they could
contain themselves no longer and burst into uncontrolled laughter.

More talk and information exchanged continued at the fire till
it was getting late.  Finally, I could keep my open no longer and 
had to retire.  This was a task in itself as it was so cold that I 
was shaking as I climbed into the upper bunk and unrolled my bed-roll.  
After a few minutes my body warmed up and I finally was lulled into a
slumber with occasional interruptions from the revelers still
at the camp fire.  When I last was awake, I heard what apparently
was a mouth harp playing strange cords in the night.....

                           To be continued..............
