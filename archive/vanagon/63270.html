Greetings VolksFolks..........

While sitting inside a very stuffy vanagon during a torrential downpour at
O'Leno State Park Campout this past weekend, we were trying to determine
how to improve, increase, or modify ANYTHING to get some ventilation.

Question #1:
I would be *very* interested to hear what ingenuity the &quot;Royal&quot; and
&quot;Collective&quot; &quot;We&quot; has invented in that regard.....

and .....

Question #2:
Dave Easterwood and I were discussing the possibility of manufacturing
custom jalousied windows for vanagons. Would any of you be interested?

and....


Question #3:
Has anyone retrofitted the top canvas to reinstate the side triangular
windows as are in my 72?




Thanks!
