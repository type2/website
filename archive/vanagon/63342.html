&gt; Subject: Asbestos in VWs -- VWOA Denies it's a Covert Recall
&gt; Date: Tuesday, July 22, 1997 11:12 PM
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For those of you who haven't been following this, I've been trying for
&gt; quite a while to get VW to issue a definitive written policy on
replacement
&gt; of heating system components in '72-and-up aircooled Transporters.
&gt;
&gt; In June, I specifically asked for a statement detailing what VW would
&gt; replace, under what circumstances, in which countries. Ten days later,
&gt; having received a &quot;we'll get back to you&quot; email from Marilyn Kenyon of
&gt; VWOA, I reiterated that what I was looking for was a specific policy on
&gt; what, why and where.
&gt;
&gt; Following is what VWOA considers a &quot;definitive&quot; response (their word).
It's
&gt; not an unofficial recall, which is what I called it; it's not a parts
&gt; exchange, which is what one listee was told; it's a scientific sampling.
&gt;
&gt; It isn't clear whether they're going to continue to replace the heater
&gt; systems; if they've concluded there's no health hazard there's no reason
to
&gt; keep on replacing them--but it doesn't say they won't, either. No word on
&gt; whether this &quot;investigation&quot; applies to non-US markets. That is, they
&gt; answered none of my questions, they merely distanced themselves from the
&gt; dreaded r-word.
&gt;
&gt; At one time I had some reservations about whether VW ought to be held
&gt; responsible for components that are so old. But the way Ms. Kenyon tells
&gt; it, if VW replaces your heating system, you're doing VWOA a favor. Ain't
&gt; science wonderful?
&gt;
&gt; Somebody post Le Coz's phone number again.

&gt; &gt;Priority: normal
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Dear Mr. Hooper:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is in further response to your E-mail of June 12 to our Web site
and
&gt; &gt;follows up on our interim reply of July 1.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You have advised us that you are aware of  &quot;an unofficial recall
&gt; &gt;concerning asbestos gaskets used in the heating systems of post-71
&gt; &gt;air-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.&quot;  You appear to base your conclusion
&gt; &gt;upon information from several owners of Volkswagen vans who have
asserted
&gt; &gt;they are the beneficiaries of certain repairs paid by Volkswagen.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In fact, Volkswagen has not conducted any recall concerning asbestos
&gt; &gt;gaskets in heater systems of Volkswagen automobiles and has no plans to
&gt; &gt;do so.  Your misimpression may have been based upon the removal and
&gt; &gt;replacement by Volkswagen of America representatives of certain heater
&gt; &gt;system components in a small sample of older Volkswagen vans although
the
&gt; &gt;vehicles were far out of warranty.  Volkswagen removed these components
&gt; &gt;from customer-owned vehicles, and naturally installed replacements,
&gt; &gt;because its engineers were interested in confirming whether or not
heater
&gt; &gt;system components used in 1972 through 1982 Volkswagen vans equipped
with
&gt; &gt;air-cooled engines posed a health hazard after 15 or more years of use,
&gt; &gt;as some persons have suggested.  The investigation performed to date by
&gt; &gt;these engineers confirms that the heater systems in these Volkswagen
vans
&gt; &gt;do not pose a health hazard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Some owners have also expressed concern about the supply of replacement
&gt; &gt;heater parts for these vans.  Because of the age of the vehicles in
&gt; &gt;question, Volkswagen's stock of replacement heater components has
&gt; &gt;unfortunately been completely exhausted.  However, we know that heat
&gt; &gt;exchangers are available as replacement parts from a number of
&gt; &gt;aftermarket suppliers.  We suggest that any owner of a 1972 through 1982
&gt; &gt;model Volkswagen van who requires a new part we can no longer supply,
and
&gt; &gt;in particular a new heat exchanger, ask his repair facility to contact
&gt; &gt;one of these suppliers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Please let us know whether you require any additional information.  If
&gt; &gt;you believe it to be helpful, we would be pleased to meet with you at a
&gt; &gt;place and time convenient to you for the purpose of further review of
&gt; &gt;your concerns.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Sincerely yours,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Marilyn Kenyon
&gt; &gt;Team Leader
&gt; &gt;Customer Relations
