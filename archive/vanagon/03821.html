Subject: '86 Vanagon Head Gasket Leaks

Furthering the '83-'85 Vanagon Folks message on head gasket leaks, the
problem definitely effects '86s.  I, and a friend with a similiar '86, had
head gasket leaks at approx 60K miles.  Both were repaired by the same dealer
and we have had no problem since (now at 135K miles).  I was told that they
used a &quot;new, improved&quot; head gasket!!  I did have the heads checked for torque
a short time after the work (actually part of a recall).

My friend was able to get some cash back from VW resulting from his CONSTANT
complaining to the district office about the problem.  As I remember, it 
cost approx $900 for the dealer repair.
