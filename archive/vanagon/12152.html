Subject: Re: Ebersparker (SP?) heater for 1970 Westie

&gt;At the Palo Alto swapmeet Yesterday .I got myself a good working ebersparker.
&gt;But there is a problem.
&gt;
&gt;The westie has a spare wheel well just where the heater is meant to go.  Does
&gt;one just cut away at the bottom of the spare wheel well and put the spare
&gt;wheel on the front of the bus. Shoud the cut-off wheel well be filled with
&gt;plywood say 1/2 &quot; thick or a piece of pop-riveted sheet metal.

I would use sheet metal for fire proofing -

&gt;Should the heater connect to the regular heater so that is works as a
&gt;defroster and everything or should the heat just get into the bus under the
&gt;rear seat?

You should get the ductwork that routes thru the firewall, past the gas tank 
and behind and under the back seat.  There is also a cable that runs to the 
front seat and a special timer switch on the dash.

I just took a unit out of my parts Westy and sold it.  I keep my Westy off 
the road in winter.
