There was an article in one of the Boston weekly newspapers (not the
Phoenix but something like it) a few days ago about the Boston comedy
scene, and it described Click and Clack as a couple of MIT guys who were
primarily comedians (and, by implication, car experts secondarily).  The
author rendered this description in all (mechanical) innocence, it
seemed to me.  From what little I've seen or heard of them, they seem
mostly common sensical -- such as the observation that brakes are
cheaper to replace than clutches so think twice about routinely
gearing-own to slow a vehicle, etc., and their website is fun to read. 
Beyond that, dunno. Cheers, Art
