&gt; i would strongly recommend NOT getting the MXV's ... they are NOT
&gt; reinforced and hydroplaned badly on my 86 bus!!! and i mean like in
&gt; &quot;moderate&quot; rain at 40 mph. i got rid of them as quickly as i could afford.
&gt; 
&gt; joelI have been told by various tire shops since 1988,that the Michelin MXL 
Reinforced tire is no longer made. BS! Last year I purchased a extra set 
from  TIRE RACK. The set before that I got on special order from SAM'S. 
look alround folks,they are still out there.
