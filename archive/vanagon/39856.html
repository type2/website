Subject: removing westfalia letters or in praise of WD40

Vanagonians,

It's said to report, but my Westy is nolonger readily identified by the 
masses, I've removed the Westfalia letters from the pop-top. The rear ones
were pealing off and weren't looking too good, so I peeled them off. At first I
tried to heat the remaining glue with a heat gun, but was afraid of damaging
the fiberglass, so I started to use denatured alcohol. This kind of worked
but some glue was still left behind. So I went to remove the letters off the
front of the van by peeling them off. This didn't work, so I used the heat
gun to loosen up the glue and pushed the letters off with a paint scraper.
This left a lot of glue behind, so I tried the alcohol again but there was
too much glue for the alcohol to work. It was at this point that I remember
someone from the list recommending using WD40 to loosen up glue when removing
stickers off windows. So I sprayed some of the glue with the WD40 and sure
enough it started to come off. I then soaked a rag with the WD40 and the rest
came off. 

I used some rubbing compound all around the sides of the pop-top followed
by a wax. This deep cleaned the pop-top and gave it a nice shine, also there
is no trace of the letters. Next time I'll have to do the rest of the top.
