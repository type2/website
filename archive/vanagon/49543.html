Subject: Re: What's the biggest box you carried in a VW

I once carried a 10' piece of countertop home from Building's Screwed in my '72
Westy, all doors closed. Also an extra large capacity Whirlipoo washer in the
box (had to take the sink/icebok out for that one). Also carried home 13 sheets
of plywood home on top, no luggage carrier, just a sheet of cardboard and a
nylon strap attached to the gutters. Cranked it down tight and the plywood
curved down around the roof (I don't have a pop-top). It was extremely stable in
this configuration. Try *that* in a Brick! (Of course, you could probably get 13
sheets *inside* the Brick).
