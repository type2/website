Subject: Query about knob on '60

out enough about it to drive it but there's two knobs to pull like 
chokes on either side of a twist knob below the middle of the seat.  
The knobs refuse to be pulled and twisting the knob doesn't do anything 
to the motor.  There's no instruction book and a dealer I phoned said 
it's the heater control.

    Your knowledge and reply is appreciated.
