&gt; 	Where can we find a cushion for the bed that goes
&gt; 	over the engine compartment?
I made my own from 5&quot; foam padding. I reupholstered the entire bed anyway, so I
just made a new cover for that pad, and it all matches. It wasn't hard at all,
although it helps if you have access to an industrial sewing machine.
&gt;
&gt; 	Is it advisable to mount the spare tire on the front?
I know many people who think so. A friend of mine was run off the road by a
semi, and hit a wall head on. HAd that tire not been there, she might not be
here today...
&gt;
&gt; 	If so, how hard is it to do this?
No trouble at all. You can either use threaded rivets, or bolts and washers...
