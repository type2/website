Subject: Re: Oil Pressure Springs and Pressure adjusters


I'd go with a HD oil pump and the grooved piston, larger spring.

The grooved piston/larger spring was an update VW made to the late
1500/early 1600 single port engines. It can't hurt. The larger
oilpump will boost pressure somewhat as well as increase the
flow of your oil
