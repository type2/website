Subject: 1986 Vanagon Info Request- Please, Please, Please

Vanagoneers,

I have begun work on the &quot;1986 Vanagon Model Summary USA&quot; and have the
following requests/questions for the group (1986 owners - in particular)
about Vanagons in the USA:

1. Does anyone have a 1986 VW Color &amp; Upholstery Guide?
   If so, can you tell me which paint colors were available on which models?
   Which upholstey types/colors were available on which models?

2. Was a 1986-1/2 Wolfsbug Limited Edition produced?
   If so, can someone please describe the standard &amp; optional equipment for
it?
   Any special paint options also, please.

3. Anyone with a 1986 window sticker or other reliable MSRP information,
please send     me the pricing details.  There were at least 7 models, so
please don't think that       someone else on the list will send me the
information.  It will likely take all the list's    86 owners to come up with
a price for each model.

4. Was there a center seat option for the GL Camper models this year?
   If so, what was the seat like and what did it cost?

5. Were the optional power mirrors heated?  I know that they are in later
models, but the    brochure never mentions heat in the mirrors.

6. The brochure mentions in one small place, a 9 passenger seating capacity.
 Was       this really an option in 1986?  If so, what was the seating
configuration that       accomidated 9 passengers?
