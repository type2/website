&gt;PO was in Florida, west of Orlando, when he got the plastic piece that 
&gt;extended the useful life of the original hatch openers.  I cannot find a 
&gt;suitable replacement anywhere.  Anyone have a source for this piece which 
&gt;bolts onto the metal rod and has a 5 inch plastic piece that you press 
&gt;against the rod and lower the hatch until the top piece of the hatch 
&gt;opener is stopped.  Should sell for less that $10.

I've bought these from JCWhitney before and have seen them for sale at
Walmart.  They're about $5.00-$7.00 each and come with a little hacksaw blade
to trim the prop to the right length.
