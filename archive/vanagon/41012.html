Subject:  81 maximum battery dimensions? 

i am wanting to put in a deep-cycle for music listening, etc. while
camping, and would like to put it in as soon as i get the van back from the
shop, where it has been for the past month. as i don't have access to it,
does anybody know the maximum battery dimensions for fitting under the
driver's seat?  any brand preferrences?

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)
