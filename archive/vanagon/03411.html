Subject: Re: article on A/C retrofit to R-134a (new freon)

I heard the other day that DOT and EPA had given tentative approval to a
company making a direct replacement for r-12. The only problem with it was
that it was very reactive with R-12, so the system would have to be
evacuated and the fittings to fill the a/c system would have to be changed
so that r-12 couldn't be pumped in..
