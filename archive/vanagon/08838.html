Right. &quot;Normally&quot; with a water-cooled VW Vanagon, you remove the
transmission to do a clutch.  Then, once you get the clutch out, you find
you need to remove the flywheel to replace the seal.  The transmission is
bolted to the engine which has remained attached to the car via the rear
engine mounts and suspended on the front via two cement blocks and a 2x4. 

Picture in Bentley on 13.40 figure 9.
Vanagon '84 1.9L DH engine DU tranny. (4 speed 091/1)

Still scratching my head.
