Subject: muffler possibilities

Has anyone, or does anyone know if the early, federal, late '70's muffler
will fit '80 heater boxes?  That arrangement they call an &quot;exhaust system&quot;
has got to be the all-time weak spot in VW engineering history.  I
acknowledge that removing the catalyst from the system is not exactly legal;
but I know for a fact that a properly maintained engine without a catalyst is
much more efficient and cleaner burning that a poorly maintained,
cat-equipped engine!  Besides, shouldn't I get some kind of karmic 'pollution
credit' for commuting by bike? (everyday, and this am its 42 and pouring,
thank god and WLGore for gore-tex!) TIA Patrick and
Utta ('80 westi, engine here, parts flying at it from all directions!)
