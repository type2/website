Subject: More about Brazilian buses

It seems that there is more than one kind of Brazilian bus.
Let me describe the one that my mates got (it sounds almost
like yours - Harris).

It's a '78 bus, it has Bay window front cab doors and front
panel, with the VW logo pressed into the front panel - not a
stick on badge. It has side opening doors on one side like a
split. It has split rear arches, grilles and four square
windows down each side.

It has 23 window corner windows in the rear quarters and a
narrow tailgate with the larger 23 window style glass.

The rear lights are off the '74 -&gt; '78 model van.

The rear bumper is off a '64 split, and the front bumper is
unique - designed to match the style of the rear, yet fit
onto the front bumper mount of a '78 front panel.

It has the chassis of a split and the running gear also
(reduction boxes etc..).

I've got a photo which I'm gonna scan and I'll try and post
it somewhere. The bus has been fully restored and won a few
prizes at shows. Its history was traced back to the Falkland
Islands (You know that one we had the little dumb war over).
Where it came from before then, well I guess Argentina.

I've got another mate whose got a '60 23 Window and a (get this)
Twin Sliding door Split Panel Van - mega rare!

They sure did make some weird boxes!

I'd love to see a picture of the front radiator model Brazilian
Bus.

Lee.
