In response to your self-tightening question. Could it be that the lug
&quot;bolts&quot; are tightened the opposite direction the wheel turns and over
time become tighter? This is what the previous owner told me, and I broke
a  socket wrench reaching the same conclusion. The fourway cheapo spanners
are BTW useless for taking off VW lug &quot;bolts&quot;. I found slipping the hollow
end of the jack over the wrench gives more torque BTW.

It may also have to do with the greater surface area a lug bolt has (and
potential for rust etc) over a conventional nut. Maybe some engineer can
tell us the physics behind the different designs?
