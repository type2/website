Subject: poptop alignment

I currently have no seal on my 69 westy top, I've noticed that the camper
portion does not line up with the luggage rack. It appears that the last
inch of the top should rest on the lip of the luggage rack. Right now the
top rides below the lip of the rack. When I replace the seal, will this
correct the problem or do I need to look for another solution to the
problem. ALSO is it possible for a generator to run out of balance?
