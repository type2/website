Subject: recall info

Hi out there,

Does anybody know a nice simple way (preferably on-line) to find out
when and where recall service was performed on a vehicle?  There were
apparently a number on the 87 vanagons.  According to VW of Am., mine
has had them all done.  However, since I bought it used, I didn't have
any of it done myself.  Also, I wouldn't put it past the dealer I bought
it from to have checked off that he did them all during the time that he
had the vehicle.

Thanks for any input,
Tonya
