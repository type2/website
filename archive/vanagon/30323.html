Subject: Heat Exchanger mystery, solved! 

	Brian,
	I believe that is exactly the answer! The 'odd' heaterbox's
geometry reminded me of something, and reading your response I realized
it was separate control boxes that I had on my 914 (type IV).

	Maybe I should put it back together, take it back to the 
junk yard and get another one? Hmmm, maybe I'll give 'em a call
anyway... I guess I can use the wrong-handed flapper as a pattern
for having a new, correct, one made up. A neat little mystery, this!

	And I've just realized I don't need to be told an angle for
the operating lever, since the remains that are still attached to
the flapper pivot *are* at whatever angle they need to be relative
to the flapper.
	Thanks!
	Bill
