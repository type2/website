Subject: RE: where did J.C.whitney get my address?

 &gt;DITTO HERE
But the last time I bought something from them(it was those magnetic
screens you put over the drivers &amp; pass windows) I received a card in
the mail (along with the latest Car &amp; Driver Mag). that said
compliments of JC Whitney! I got a whole years subsciption for free,
but have you ever noticed they never have Anything about VW in C&amp;D?
P.S. along with those screens I got the phone # of the mfg. and bought
a similar magnetic  screen for the sliding door that was made 
specifically for a VAnagon, it works great . I'm sure you folks in the great
northern tundra would not be interested in screen ventilation for 
every door and window in your Van this time of year, but here today it got up to 
70 f . I guess I won't be putting the electric heater in the engine 
compartment tonight. 
If anyone wants the mfg phone # let me know.
