Subject: 23-Window Value?

Towed the '63 23-Window Sunroof Deluxe in this past weekend (the one I 
traded a '72 transaxle for).  There were some severe cross winds, but the 
amount of rust in the Bus lessened the effect.  I haven't had a chance to 
dig all the stuff out of the Bus and give it a good going over, but it appears 
that the rust has gotten a good foot-hold.  Due to cancer beyond my meager body
working skills, I'll probably pass this beauty on to someone else.  Anyone know 
what a rusty Deluxe, w/o a motor or title might be worth?
