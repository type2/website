&gt; blinks for a short time after starting up. 
&gt; I don't know why it does it or what its supposed to tell the
&gt; driver but its bloody annoying.

It blinks at startup to tell the driver that it is working properly.  If
you ever start the vehicle and it doesn't blink, then don't expect it to
blink for you if the vehicle over heats.  The problem some folks are having
is the initial test blinking persists longer than it should.
