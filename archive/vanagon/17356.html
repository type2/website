&gt; Yah, like the other guy said, the vents to the rear are where the rear
&gt; facing seat and sink would be in a westy.  I am using the door panels off a
&gt; non-westy for both front doors because they have the armrests, mainly.  I
&gt; also grabbed the vent parts from the parts bus I had and will someday
&gt; install the rear vent on the passenger side.  I don't think it's worth it on
&gt; the drivers side since I like the rear facing seat.
&gt; 
&gt; Eug,
&gt; '71   
That was going to be my next question -- I'm looking at replacing
the door panels someday -- from what you say, the vent tubes are
attached to the panel, and there are westy/non-westy door panels.
If I order an aftermarket set of door panels, will I get ones
with vent tubes?
