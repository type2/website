Subject: Re: 84 Vanagon Fuel Pump


&gt;&gt; A friend of mine with an 84 Vanagon just called me to ask
&gt;&gt; if he was getting hosed for a $375 fuel pump.  I said he
&gt;&gt; probably was.  I don't think a fuel pump should cost more 
&gt;&gt; than $150.

Thanks for all the replies.  I ended up ordering a new pump
from NOPI (who I absolutely HATE dealing with).  Check out 
the difference in prices...

		Over Counter	Mail Order	Sale Mail Order

New Bosch	$218		$196		$145
Rebuilt Bosch	$124		$108		$80

If I could get the Sale Mail Order price over the counter I
would drive 4 miles to pick it up and have the Vanagon back
on the road within 1 hour.  Now I have to wait until Monday
for it to be delivered.  Judging from my success rate with 
them in the past I will probably have to return it because
they sent the wrong part.  AAARRRGGGHHH!!!  The things we do
to save $75...
