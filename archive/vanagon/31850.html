Ah, yesss, mein schatz, ze syncro grabbie hoppie stalls in tight turns zymptom.

1.  Could be a locked rear diff.  Czech by seeing if the scrape marks from 
the tires are from the front or the rear when you crab it around.

2.  Most likely failure is the VC ~1800$US for the part alone.  If you have 
driven the car or the DAPO used tires that weren't within say 5-10% of 
indentical diameters front and rear for a lengthy period of time, the VC was
transferring some amount of power all the time and may have warped the 
internals due to heat dissipation problems.  If this is the case the unit
is not repairable and must be replaced.  BOHICA VWUSA gotcha.  

To czech this the front wheels will crab badly and stall the motor in tight
turns in either direction on dry pavement.  The VC will continue to function
but will always be slightly &quot;on&quot; and will degrade to a full &quot;on&quot; over time.
