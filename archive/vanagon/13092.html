We are dedicated to having a paint job done. Even though the Van cam from
CA and we were able to cut through most of the faded paint a paint job
serves other purposes, namely protecting all surfaces from rust and
corrosion wcih can be quite a problem up here (especially if we plan to
drive in Winter). Yes I have gone the rubbing compound route, then the
touch up paint and then the spray bomb all of which help...still a paint
job is better for
other reasons. We are not however dedicated to MR Scheib or MAACO so if
anyone has any ideas on that account...

My wife is determined to have the roof painted in the same ivory colour.
This I guess would be better than  a dark colour (if it must be painted);
although I am partial to the original white. The big concern is peeling
since paint does not stick as well to fibreglass.....

As for wallpaper Martha, we will keep my eyes open. My first choice would
be to cover over the existing paper rather than remove it....
