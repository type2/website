Subject: one more Idiot Factor story /f

	I told my dad about this thread and he sent the following two
and a half examples. Geez, it runs in the family! Better not tell my 
fiancee... :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This doesn't [formally] qualify because it was with my 356C but it's 
the &quot;Same&quot; engine so:

I began to have problems with fuel starvation. I would run along and all of a
sudden, cough, cough, sputter, die. I'd roll to a stop, wait, fire up, and go
again. Happened on freeways mostly. 

I reset the carburetor float levels, disassembled and cleaned the fuel pump,
replaced the fuel pump, nothing worked. Checked the ignition system many times,
new plugs, new coil, new wires. Nothing. Suspected muffler, dismounted it,
checked inside. Nothing. 

If the latter seems bizarre, it was because I have a friend, Dick Williams,
whose wife Shirley had a Ford Thunderbird of the 1960's, big, hulking, plush
variety. She complained of poor performance.

He is an excellent mechanic who began life as an aircraft engine mechanic at
NARF Alameda overhauling Navy piston engines. He did all the ignition,
electrical and carburetor stuff on Shirley's beloved T-Bird. No joy. He then
overhauled the engine! No joy. Poor performance.

He finally measured manifold pressures on the newly overhauled V-8. Intake
vacuum not what it should be at idle-not enough vacuum. Drilled and tapped a
hole and measured exhaust manifold pressure. Sky high! Eight to ten psi! Thought
about explosions as he shut it down.

Exhaust pipes and manifold okay, open and clear. Cut muffler apart to find that
one layer of a two layer chamber had worked loose and become bent inwards enough
to almost entirely block the gas passage. It all became painfully clear to him.

Finally, I had to abort a trip to Sacramento and rent a car at the Oakland
Airport because the problem, leaving the 356 in the parking lot. It was
overwhelming me.

Finally, in Sacramento, at Uncle Walt's, the light dawned, about three months
after the onset: it must be a clogged fuel filter! Clogged enough to prevent
fuel delivery at high speeds but not enough to inhibit idling, street driving,
etc. The car would accelerate to freeway speeds because the caburetors had full
bowls but at speed, the fuel flow could not keep the bowls full, their levels
would drop, and the engine would starve. If you drove at or less than the speed
the fuel filter could sustain, all was well. Idling was cinch so you could never
find the problem in the garage.

I bought a new filter in Sacramento, reclaimed the car, replaced filter in the
parking lot and drove home at freeway speeds with no problem. Ripped open old
filter and found a mass of rust particles-just as I suspected.

Only then did it dawn on me that the onset was connected with something I had
done to the fuel system up near the tank, where I had apparently stirred up 20
years of quietly lurking rusty sediment that promptly headed aft to the filter.
I think what I had done was for no apparent reason other than it might be a good
thing to do, something I had read, like, HOT TIP #n: Every five years or
60,000km blow out the fuel lines. Or something like that.

I had blown out the fuel line from the REAR and promptly shot all the
accumulated crud back into the tank where it began its return journey to you
know where!

Moral of the story: Blow out fuel lines towards the ENGINE, into a bucket, not
towards the TANK! ANY idiot knows THAT! But I didn't... and it cost me about 3
months of flailing around. No brain in use there.

This stupidity is exceeded only by my escapade of trying to drill a hole with my
new electric drill running in reverse, something I did not notice even while
watching the drill bit smoke and burn in ruins! My mind told me that the steel
tube I was driling was miraculously hardened when I had drilled a hole in its
other end with no problem a week before! How dumb can you, or rather I, get?
That takes the cake and taught me a lesson: Be aware if your tools have a
forward or backwards switch. At the time, that had escaped me. No brain in use
there.
