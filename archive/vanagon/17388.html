Probably,
Spammers have used the &quot;dying kid&quot; routine to get mail floods
many a time.
And even if it is for real, there are more important things in
the world than receiving post cards or getting into the guinness
book of world records.  
Someone should post that their kid is dying from some horrible
disease and the kid wants to make a collection of VWs.  :)
Sorry if I offended you by making light of what you consider serious,
but spamming is irritating.
