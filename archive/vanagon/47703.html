&gt; Hello everyone, I'm building an engine for my girlfriends ' 61 Bug and am
&gt; wondering about the thermostat.  I'd like to NOT install it at all and wire
&gt; the cooling flaps into an &quot;always open&quot; position.  I'm taking out the heat
&gt; exchangers and running J-tubes so not having a heater is obvious.  I did this
&gt; with my Type III engine, wiring the cooling flaps open but I'm just want to
&gt; get some advice for doing this with a Type I.  It's not driven much in the
&gt; winter although the winters can be cold (Eastern Washington). Thanks for the
&gt; input.....

THe thermostat is used to close the flaps when the engine is cold so it 
warms up quicker in cold weather.  Without the thermostat installed, the 
flaps are wide open as you'd like them to be.  The only trouble may be in 
the cold weather so you may need more time to warm up.
