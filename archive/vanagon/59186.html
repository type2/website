Hey Sean, your connection makes sense.  That pilot light is directly 
behind the driver side window area.  Mine usually stays on, but has 
occasionally gone out, could of been the window.  Presumably there is a 
safety device that shuts off the main gas feed when the pilot goes out (I 
hope, does anyone know?).  I'll experiment next time I go camping.
On the subject of pilot lights, it took a notice on a gas pump to remind 
me to shut off the pilot when fueling, I felt retarded!

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I've noticed that when driving with the fridge lit on propane, rolling
&gt; down the driver's window usually causes the flame to extinguish.  I
&gt; think it's setting up some kind of draft or suction.  Any ideas from
&gt; anyone?

&gt; &gt;      I have driven many thousands of miles contiguously with the 
&gt; &gt;      refrigerator in my westy running on propane while driving (three 
&gt; &gt;      trans-american trips in the last two years).  
&gt; &gt;      
&gt; &gt;      I've never had a problem with the flame being extinquished.
