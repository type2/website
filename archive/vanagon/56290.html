Subject: Re: **BIG NEWS!!** 

&gt;no advertising/low margin approach is working.  Also, thanks to Ken's (and 
&gt;Gerry's) assistance, I will be able to verify that those who claim the 
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!          
&gt;discount (and check writing priveleges) are in fact listmembers and are
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^!
If my name and email address has been passed on from V_at_L to a 3rd party
without me being advised of it I want it removed from any newly created
list.  The distribution of mailing lists without express permission of the
members is something generally frowned upon.  I trust you will have no
problem complying with this removal request Ron.
