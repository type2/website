Try Jefferson, Co. (Louisville) Kentucky.
I was trucking down down that way from Ohio to visit some relatives when
Buford Fat A$$ pulls me over.  The 45 minute ordeal included such choice
quotes as &quot;...things would go much smoother if you'd co-operate&quot; or my
favorite, &quot;...why don't you let me take a look in bus...&quot;
kentucky considers a motor vechicle to be private property-i.e. you have
to pay property tax on it.  I finnaly got tired of Officer
Traumatic-Head-Wound and began to get beligerant...a) I wasn't speeding-he
pulled over just after an on ramp!  b) I drive a westy, aka motorhome aka
&quot;got a search warrant&quot;  Sheriff Lobo there finnaly let me go after I
convinced him that I wasn't going to &quot;let him take a look inside my 'bus'&quot; 
I am firmly convinced that he was an asswhole (misspelling intentional)

moral of this story: Be prepared for Louisville, KY if you are
a lawbreaking hippy type, (ie you have some dead stickers)
