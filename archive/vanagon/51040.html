Subject: Turbo Diesel Purchase

I have been looking for a diesel engine as a spare for my VW truck( or one
to put into a blown Jetta or Golf for my son to drive to college).  I
purchased my last VW Diesel engine from a Japanese engine import place here
in the L.A. area.  I could them recently and yes, they finally had a VW
Diesel engine available. The price is about $400.00 complete.  When I made
arrangements to pick it up, the fellow informed me that it was a VW Turbo
Diesel engine.  (complete with pump and turbo).  Well, I'm not sure about this.
Could I use this in a non-turbo VW sedan or Rabbit pickup?  Or is there
someone out there who would be interested in this engine for a Vanagon
prodject?  The import place usually gives 30 day Warr. on Diesels, but he
said since this engine is rare, no warranty would be given.

Your thoughts on this?
