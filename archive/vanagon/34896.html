&gt; Is anyone using a Bosch 009 distributer on a 1700cc pancake engine?  
&gt; I was told that the 009's were made for a different engine(Bug 
&gt; engine) and that they retard the spark to the #3 cylinder.  I was 
&gt; told that this is not needed for a bus engine because the #3 cylinder 
&gt; does not have an overheating problem like the bug.  I bought a 1974 

That's basically true.  The mechanical-advance 009 distributor did not
work well for me on my type IV 1800cc bus engine.  There was a major
flat spot at part throttle that I never could get rid of.  One day on a
whim I put the stock dual vacuum advance distributor back in and guess
what?  It ran a whole helluva lot better, and no flat spot.

&gt; camper with a 1700cc engine(hardly ran) an it has an 009 distributer 
&gt; on it.  I am in the process of rebuilding the engine now.  The same 
&gt; guy who told me all this about the 009 said that to put it in a 
&gt; pancake engine the right way you have to cut the tins a little. Has 
&gt; anyone had to do this.  He also said he has seen alot of people that 
&gt; have it put in backwards so that the #1 plug is retarded. 

I think he's retarded.  There is no reason to retard the #1 plug or any
plug for that matter, and the distributor can only go in one way unless
you are talking about resetting the distributor drive shaft which is a
very stupd thing to do, IMO.
