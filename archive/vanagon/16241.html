Subject: Re: stripping the undercarriage

does anybody know if there are wire brushes (the type that fit in your
ordinary drill) that would fit in a 5&quot; Disc Grinder. Right now i have a
cutting disk on it and would like to outfit it with a bit less abrasive
disk (i.e. the wire brush idea) and strip some surface rust off the bottom
(i.e. undercarrige) of the bus.
