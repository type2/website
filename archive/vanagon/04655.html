Subject: 5-seater Westy?



&gt;   I'd obviously love to have one myself, having grown up with 3 VW 
&gt;   campers, but I have a family of *5*.  And no, leaving someone at home
&gt;   is not an option - get off the list *now* if you feel that way...

I was faced with a similar problem with our 82 Diesel Westy.  I went down
to the Favorite Local Parts Recycler (in political incorrect: junkyard) and
pulled a middle bench seat out of a carcass.  It served our purpose well, 
even though I had to drill the holes, rust-proof the openings for the bolts,
and adopt some wing-nut based fasteners for it.

The true solution became apparent after we bought the weekender:
The rear-facing seats are a cinch to install and take out.  They
do not bolt onto the floor; they just rest in two depressions on
the floor and they latch onto a hefty attachment that is bolted
to the base where the front seat rests on.  If I knew then what
I know now, I would have just taken a rear-facing seat out of a
weekender, and installed it.  I am quite mad at my local dealer
for not pointing this out to me when I needed the advice....
