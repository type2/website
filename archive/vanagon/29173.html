&gt; &gt;        Hi all,
&gt; &gt;        First, let me tall you that there is a very cool thing
&gt; &gt;up near Seattle, the Boeing Company Surplus Sale Building. Its
&gt; &gt;at South 208th and 84th Ave South, in Renton, I believe, and
&gt; &gt;open Tuesday-Friday 10-5, Saturday 9-4. Their info line is 206 393 4062
&gt; &gt;and that's got directions and hours, you can talk to a person there
&gt; &gt;at 206 393 4065.

Yeah!  The ultimate upgrade for Steve &quot;Ratboy&quot; Johnson's diesel 
porta-potti!  

Hey kids!  How about replacing those worn-out squashed down uncomfortable 
seats with some comfy full reclining business class airline seats?  
Looking for a pod to mount all those guages in?  How about the instrument 
cluster from a 747?  Ever considered installing RADAR in the bus?  Why 
not pick up a few hydraulic pistons off some landing gear and make a lift 
for your garage?  Instrumentation?  Did you say you wanted some 
instrumentation?  Come right this way--voltmeters, ammeters, 
decompression warning lights, you got it.  My favorite are the &quot;bargain 
bins&quot;--55 gallon oil drums filled with pipes, sheets, airfoil 
cross-sections, etc., of titanium, aluminum, etc. all for a flat low, low 
price per pound.

And a VW Bus has LOTS of space to hold all the goodies you'll walk out of 
there with!
