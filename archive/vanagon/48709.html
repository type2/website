&gt;    i for one would be happy to pay for some stuff, even if the prices are
&gt;    just a bit more than the actual cost to produce it.
&gt;    
&gt;    everyone:  be nice, and realise that he is doing us all a favour!

If it wern't for the list, I would never have purchased my bus, now the
&quot;Road hoop-tee&quot; 

Support The List!
