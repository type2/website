  Thanks for all the info on books, now all I have to do is make some 
 time to get them and start reading.  I wish I had more sunlight to work 
 it even gets cold in NC after the sun goes down.  My stick lamp only 
 keeps the hand holding it and the side of my face that gets burned warm.
 I sure would love to have a garage to work in.  
 
  While mom is crusing around back home in my '73 Rusty (more rust I think 
 than camping gear), I am bumming rides from nice people.  I'm still 
 tinkering every evening with the FI on the '78.  I got it to run one 
 early evening, even took it out for a &gt;35 mph spin.  I got all excited 
 and cleaned the motorcycle parts out of the inside and proceeded to tell 
 my friends I would be driving myself to school.  I was smart enough to 
 give it one more test drive to find out if it would take me all the way 
 to school.  The rest is history.
 
  I packed up my toolbox and my trusty dog, Buddy, and we went for a spin.
 We stopped to get some fresh gas and add that bottle of injector cleaner 
 my wife got me.  Next, I was off to see if this mailbox of mine would go 
 the distance.  With Buddy in his seat and me in mine, we set out with 
 visions of passing cars on the beltway.  We must have gone... oh I don't 
 know... maybe... two blocks and then it happened.  The bus idled but 
 would die if I touched the gas pedal.  So I did the all familiar &quot;jiggle 
 every single wire connecter in the engine compartment,&quot; and nothing 
 happened to make me go.  I would get power after starting, but then it was 
 like I was out of feul pressure and I would come to a halting stop if I 
 didn't push the clutch in fast enough.  I did have a sorta down hill 
 ride back to the homestead and the starter and battery helped with the 
 slight hills.
  Buddy loved the adventure, especially since he didn't have to get out 
 and push.  I wonder what must have been going through his head....
 
 &quot;Hey Myles, I can wait to go for a ride later when you get it running.&quot;
 
  Oh well, tomorrow I get out the test lamp and the ohmmeter, along with 
 the wire brush and the pocket knife.  I'll make all the conectors sparkle 
 and make sure everything makes contact.  Then maybe I'll get Buddy and 
 we'll take the bus out for a push.

  Maybe taking the dog fo a walk would be easier?  I could use the exercise.
