Subject: Re: Make those backup lights bright


Those lights from Herrington are available from JC Whitney for $20 a 
pair. When we used to rally the 86 GTI, we took a fog light that 
had a sandblasted lens, put in a 100W bulb and ran a lead to the
back up light...and one to a switch (just in case some idiot
was sitting on the back bumper with hi-beams on).
