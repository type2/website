&gt;paved surfaces, or maybe less, but what it amounts to, is that a flat
&gt;tire will not keep you stuck in the line of fire.

Ah. So &quot;bulletproof&quot; really means, &quot;we don't care whether you shoot holes
in them.&quot; In all the brevity, precision and concinnity of military
specification language. ;)
