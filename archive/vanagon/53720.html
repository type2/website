&gt; 
&gt; &gt; if your'e one of the lurking sniveling unknowns how do you go about 
&gt; &gt; becoming known?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; why, by telling us who we are..er..make that who YOU are..:) i presume 
&gt; most of us know who we are..
&gt; 
&gt; and what drives you. and maybe where it livees..:)
&gt; 
&gt; 

Actually and more importantly you tell Joel Walker, who knows who all 
of us are and what we drive, though I bet off hand he does not 
currently know my collection.  Joel's address escapes me at the 
moment but he posts the stats every week and can be easily responded 
to.
