Subject: Re: used parts

&gt;There are junkyards in South San Jose that let you dismantle and pick whatever
&gt;you need from hundreds of retired/injured cars including VW busses (not 
vanagons).
&gt;They charge significantly lower. I picked up an alternator for my Volvo for
&gt;$18 including a voltage regulator mounted on it. It was pure breed volvo
&gt;alternator. I saw 4 or 5 busses and at least 1 camper with the pop top
&gt;raised up. I saw a pair of air cooled cylinder heads lying on dirt and no one
&gt;seemed interested. They are probably for 1600 bugs. I think there are at least
&gt;30 may be 50 bugs sitting there waiting for parts seekers. There are still 
a lot 
&gt;of useful parts on them. Many good body parts (no rust mostly).  If you happen 
&gt;to be in San Jose go check them out. 
&gt;

Where at in SJ?  I used to live in South SJ.  I moved to Minnesota 
(Brrrrrrrr!) in 8/93.
