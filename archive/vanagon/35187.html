&gt; Maybe this was covered before but how good are NGK and
&gt; Nippendenso plugs?  I heard they give a smoother idle 
&gt; and have less &quot;resistance&quot; compared to Bosch.  Anybody
&gt; have good or bad experiences with these?  I have a SP

I put Nippondensos in my bus at one time and it ran like crap.  Replaced
them with Bosch and it ran great.  My engine didn't like the
Nippondensos, but as usual YMMV.

&gt; 1600 with a 30 PICT 1 and it idles kind of rough.  The 
&gt; timing is perfect as with the dwell, etc.  The carb
&gt; is a new &quot;rebuilt&quot; job that has a little (very little)
&gt; play on the throttle lever.  A buddy said this is 
&gt; creating a bit of a air leak.  The engine is also running
&gt; a tad rich.......  How can I get a better idle?  Replace
&gt; the carb?  I just bought the damn thing.  Oh well.

I think this &quot;air leak around the throttle shaft = big trouble&quot; thing is
a bunch of hooey.  I have two cars with lots of play in the throttle
shafts and they run and idle great.  I think you have another problem
that is causing the rough idle.
