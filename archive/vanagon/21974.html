Subject: RE: How come so slow up hill?



&gt;Got the new engine in a-ok. Thought that dogs and cross country runners
&gt;would no longer pass us going up hill. I was wrong. Is it the auto-
&gt;matic trans? Or is it just the nature of this beastie to have no
&gt;pickup, and be reallly slow up hills?


THE SHORT ANSWER:

Yes.


THE LONG ANSWER:

This is where your type-4 engine should be better than my upright-fan
relic, Lisa. Tho your trans gearing may be taller, and your van may
also be heavier...

I'd check dwell and timing first, and correct spark plug gap and
heat range. Sorry, I don't know the specs for your engine. Mine
('70 single-port 1600) needs 48 degrees dwell, about 7.5 degrees
BTDC, and Bosch W8ACs seem to run fine. Also look for corrosion
and scarring on the cap and rotor contacts-- all the usual suspects.

One more thing to check-- carb adjustments if you have carb(s).
For these, I take it to a good VW shop. Misadjusting a carb can
toast your valves real quick, especially if you set it lean.

On moderate hills, my bus tops out at around 45 in third gear (manual
trans). On steeper ones, around 30 in second. The engine is near
redline (4400 RPM) at these speeds. Haven't had to drop down into
first yet. When I get the dual Kadrons on it, and single quiet
pack, hopefully I can use the next gear without blowing the heads
off.

OTOH, there have been some cross-country runners that I wouldn't
mind staying in back of and watching, particularly those of the
female persuasion...  ;)
