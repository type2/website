Subject: Re: fatal waterpumper flaw/Subaru?

Fine,
we know that there is some kind of flaw, and it has to do with
heads/gaskets but,
WHAT IS THIS INHERENT FLAW, already?  I mean specifically what is it and
what is the miracle cure that Subaru figured out and VW sued over?  More
details please. Let's have some definative info!!

I've never heard about this flaw, or the law suit so I'd like to know more.
And, if there is a flaw ISN'T THAT A DEFECT?  Why can't VW be made to
recall all the wasserboxers and fix the flaw?

Personally, I think that this account of the &quot;lawsuit&quot; is hogwash,
otherwise, every wasserboxer owner on the planet would sue VW.

&gt; &gt; &gt;lawsuits against Subaru, who corrected the flaw.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm unfamiliar with this legal contretemps, and as the driver of an '87
&gt; &gt; Subaru as well as a VW, am curious as to what exactly the flaw is
&gt;
&gt;I believe it's a head gasket problem.
