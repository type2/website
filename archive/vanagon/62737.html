I have ordered the parts microfiche for all of my cars.  They are about
$20 Canadian.  They are available through your local VW parts
department, but they may be reluctant/do not know how to order.  The
information is invaluable.  They show assemblies much better than
Bentley, and give give you part numbers and revs to boot.  I would not
do any work without them.  The catch is that they are quite large, and a
standard fiche reader does not handle them very well.  You can modify
the slide holder on some readers to accommodate the larger size.
