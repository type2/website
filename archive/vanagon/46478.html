Subject: RE: '87 Synro jerky running on highway

Sounds like an old, familar problem.

The first step is to check out Technical Bulletin 92-01,
located off the VW Bus server at 
http://killer-whale.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/bulletins.html#001

If thats is the problem, there are some other, less expensive fixes, check the
archives.

Good luck,

Tom F.
