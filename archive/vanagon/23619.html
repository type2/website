Subject: Re: VW-Vanagon Mailing List Split?

Hi All, 

  About this split proposal.  Maybe it's because I have both but I cannot see
any good reason to split up our group here.  I've only had loaf ('72 &amp; '73)
and the brick ('87) but I stiil like reading about splits and EV's.  Those
that don't like reading about anything but their own spheres of interest
always have the delete key.

Just my opinion.  For what it's worth as an AOLer ;-).
