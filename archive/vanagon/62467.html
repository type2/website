Subject: Re: Heater Slider Lever

Thanks to Joel Walker and Jack Reed for their correct guesses on problems
with connections to the heater boxes.

Mechanic now says he disconnected the heater boxes.  I had complained that
there was a bad smell from using the heater (when I first bought the bus
from him).  He says it was because the heater boxes were soaked in oil.
Engine was leaking when he bought it from previous owner.  He rebuilt the
engine, so the problem is solved, but he says I should wait a few more
months for the boxes to dry out completely, and then he will re-connect
(says it's a 15 minute job).

Does this sound reasonable?  Bear in mind that it's in his interest to do
as little as possible, since all work (and there has been a lot so far) is
at his expense for the 90 day warranty period.

Thanks
