Subject: Spare tire carrier bolt

Answering my own question: the bolt securing the spare on the Vanagon is 12mm
with 1.5 threads and 35mm in length. I picked that up at a hardware store
along with a washer so now I'm &quot;safe&quot;. I didn't try a lug bolt so I don't
know if they are the same size as someone suggested.
