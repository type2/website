&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So far as I know, the work done on the heads was proper. I have no 
&gt;&gt;evidence of a problem.

James:

Can you tell us some details of the work done? Did they machine the heads
or did they replace them with new/rebuilt heads? Did they do anything else 
for your engine? How much did they charge you? Did VWoA pay any portion
of the bill? Much appreciated if you could reveal more details about the
work. Thanks again.
