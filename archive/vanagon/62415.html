Hi Volks,
Texas recently reinstated emissions testing and I was wondering how
the criteria here differ from other states, eg the permitted HC is
220ppm and CO is 1.2% (at least for my year).

And yes, thank you for asking, I passed.  Well, ok, the Vanagon did.
I just stood there, sweated in the heat, watched, and then paid the
piper.
