&gt;Anybody know if the U-joint is really a replaceable and available part,

&gt;new one?  (Or got the old one still hanging around with a U-joint left
&gt;on it ;-) ?  No doubt these are hard-to-find items at *any* price.

A good driveshaft shop can get you the U-Joint. I can also get them for about
$35.00 ea.  The shaft may have to be balanced and the u-joints may have to be
shimmed to maintain concentricity. The balkance problem is a difficult one
and explains why this is not considered a serviceable part.  I have had
experiences where the only cure to the wierd vibrations was to repalce the
driveshaft.  Good luck.  There is no problem operationg te Van with the shaft
