Subject: re: EV woes (coolant tube replacement)


Don't get me wrong - I love the EV.  BUT, the thought of having another repair
come up like the one just fixed really scares me.  To replace the leaking
plastic coolant pipes running to the aux. heater (problem previously
posted) cost me $375 even with VW paying 50%.  That's a $750 bill for what
should be a do-it-yourself job on my other VWs.  In order to replace the
$185 part, they had to remove the gas tank, transmission, and some left-side
suspension pieces.  I suppose I could have eventually fixed it given a
garage, all the right tools and a week's vacation.

(No more leak, but now a shift linkage problem and a smell of gas - sigh)

On a happier note, the $12.95 (for all four) rear brake shoes from Rapid Parts 
look fine, surprisingly.  Big difference in cost from the $58/shoe dealer
quote.
