A brief update on the state of the bus I bought last week:

It was disassembled when I got it, doors off, windows out,
needed new rubber all around (some of it came with).  There
is some surface rust under the front windows, and more on the
floor in the cab area (with some small holes in the floor).

My plan is to treat as much rust as I can with the aim of 
getting the bus back in drivable shape, so mostly I'm paying
attention to areas that will be under window rubber so I
don't have to take it out again.  The rest can wait a bit,
but I have stored the bus in a friend's driveway for the next
two weeks while they're away, so getting it on the road
comes first.  A full paintjob/resto has to wait until I 
get a real job  :-)

Getting the doors and windows back on is a little bit of a project:
the door screws were missing (I assume they got trashed taking
the old ones out) and are a size not easy to find (8mm dia. 20 long
1.25 pitch, if you must know) so I had to order them, had to buy
a box of 50 and I only need about half of them so if anyone
wants some big screws . . . .

The biggest problem is the cargo doors.  The plates that the hinges
actually bolt to were not fastened to anything on the inside of the pillars
that frame the door.  So, when the doors were removed, the plates
fell down inside the sealed up tube :(  I've tried fishing them out
but they are a funny shape and are hard to get ahold of.  I've got
probably one more afternoon of fishing before I get drastic and
cut a hole in my bus to get these things out.  Either that or I
make new ones and try to slide them in somehow but it's pretty
tight in there.  Anyone else have this problem?  Surely people
take the cargo doors off.  Any advice appreciated. . . . .

OK enough rambling. . . .
