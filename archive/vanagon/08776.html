As long as you use 20w50 in temps above 50 F and keep the revs up you
should be ok. Of course you will never be a speed demon... but if you are
really concerned get a head temp gauge and allow the engine to cool down
when the head reaches 400F. On the
gas pump isssue, rebuild kits are available for mechanical fuel pumps and it
is a
simple operation to repair. Vapour lock is unlikely unless temps are hot
and/or your engine is running hot; assuming that your fuel lines are not
clogged, there isn't water in the system and your filter is clean, then
the likely culprit is the pump. ....DC
