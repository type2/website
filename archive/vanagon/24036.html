Subject: Re: f/ tv worth watching 

I saw an episode of Unsolved Mysteries last night that showed a guy in a 
Baja Bug (orange in color with unpainted Baja kit) who was referred to as 
an &quot;offroad enthusiast&quot;.  He came upon a scene in the desert where a girl 
had apparently been abducted.  Three tatooed &quot;hippies&quot; then surrounded 
this guy's Bug, basically scaring the guy to death with taunts and 
threats.  The guy was having a lot of trouble finding reverse (nice shot 
of a '70's style plaid interior, wood-rimmed steering wheel with &quot;Elvis 
Sunglasses&quot; spokes, etc.).  He finally found reverse and got the hell out 
of there (neglecting to tell anyone about the girl, who was found dead 
sometime later).  What do you think his problem was?  Bad bushings in the 
shift linkage?  Is his tranny going?  Is there a &quot;Sermon&quot; we can refer 
him to? ;-)
