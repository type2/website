Subject: FW: All those needing stove flue caps...

Digging from my archives (since no one can bother to read the FAQ):

Folks, once again, Euro-American RV Products has EVERYTHING that was part
of the standard late model Westfalia packages.

The phone number is (818) 760-4214 and
FAX is (818) 760-4216.

I have purchased several items from them (flue vent cover, sink p-trap,
skylight cover, fresh water inlet cover), and all were equal or better in
quality to the originals. Prices, while not super cheap, are much better
than from the dealership.
