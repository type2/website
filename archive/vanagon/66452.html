Subject:      Vanagon BRA caution

I have an '88 Vanagon with a bra who's mesh extends over the high-beam
headlights. I though, no problem, I'll have a friend who can sew - correct
the mesh so that the headlights are uncovered.

Well, be aware that doing this, uncovering the headlights, makes that part
of the bra act like an air scoop - and causes the bra to flap on the front
of the Vanagon. I have not determined if adjusting the retaining straps
will remedy the problem. But please be aware that this may be a problem if
you plan to adjust the mesh over the headlights.
