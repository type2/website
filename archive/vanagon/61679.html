Subject: Michelin MXT?


	Got new tires this morning for the '91 Westy. They're Michelin
	205/70R14 99S Reinforced (made in U.K.)

	The sidewall says:

		Tread plies  2 rayon
			     1 polyamide + 2 steel

		Sidewall plies 2 rayon

		MAX LOAD: 775Kg (1709 lbs)
		MAX PRESS. 340KPa (50 psi)

	I was REALLY motivated to do this after driving around and acrosxs
	the SF Bay and being buffeted by the 25-35mph crosswinds! The PO's 
	Visa V700 unidirectional 205/70R14 93S 35psi max tires resulted 
	in a scary, squirrely ride.

	Since my Westy is a non-syncro, I wasn't interested in a M+S tire
	like one of the LT195/75 Load Range D tires that have been discussed
	frequently... with 35psi front and 45 psi rear, these Michelins
	provide a stable ride with good cornering performance. I'll explore
	the envelope over time by playing with the pressures and pressure
	differential. And they're quiet...

	For those in the Bay Area: Wheel Works (also known as Howard Tire, 
	in some locations) has these in stock or can get them at ~$80 per
	tire. This tire is probably known as the MXT, although mine do 
	NOT have any such identity on the tirewall.
