&gt;         My girlfreind and I will be leaving on Aug. 3rd for a two week
&gt; excursion out to the west coast and Im starting to get things ready for it,
&gt; and would love some input.
&gt;         Things I have to get done on the van before I leave are a) new
&gt; seals for the pop top which Ill be ordering from California Imports
&gt; tommorow since they were the cheapest around. b) NEW TIRES..now Ive been
&gt; following the banter about tires here for awhile but have come to no
&gt; definte conclusion on what the hell I should invest in. I am presently
&gt; riding on Continental TS 750 185 R14's  (which is all greek to me BTW). I
&gt; was thinking about just getting the same, but some people here think
&gt; Conti's aint that sh*t hot. There was mention of the Yokohama Y370's being
&gt; solid...any other suggestions?
I have the Conti TS750's on the rear &amp; Yokos on the front. I plan to 
rotate them &amp; see how the Yokos are on the rear. I suspect they will 
be much better since they're rated for ~300lbs more and can take 
65psi. Even at 2 lbs over (42psi) I find the Conti's look soft, and 
worry about sharp rocks cutting them up on the backroads. The tread 
wear on the Conti's is also not that great - the PO put them on about 
35k km ago, and they look to be more than 1/2 worn. I plan on getting 
2 more Yokos when they wear out.

&gt;         Other than that I must also get a oil change..put some of that
&gt; brake squeek stopper stuff on, and although I hate myself for even thinking
&gt; this...I was going to take it to the miney sucking shop to gewt them to
&gt; make sure everything is all tickityboo and ready for trippin.
&gt;         What Id like to know is if anyone has other suggestions for 
things
&gt; I should get checked before I leave, and other things I should take with me
&gt; 'just incase'.
Waterpump belt...! I'd go with a synthetic oil, too...

&gt;         And...if there's anyone in Vancouver (or area) that wouldnt mind
&gt; giving me there # or address so that 'just incase' something happens I have
&gt; a contact, instead of spending all my trip money on a tow and fix.
If you make it to the Island, I'm in Victoria 592-2411 or Shawnigan 
Lake 743-9911. Have a great trip!
