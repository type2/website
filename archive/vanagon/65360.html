Subject:      Free Side Mount Antenna

Is anyone on the list (or not) interested in a side mount antenna from WCM?
 It should fit any Vanagon 80-91, and a host of other VWs (Thing, Bug and Bus
mentioned on package).  I bought it by mistake, actually needed the front
mount.  I will be happy to give it to anyone interested.  Pick it up if your
in the area (I doubt that will happen) or we can arrange shipping.
