Subject: The split and a camper ?

Just wanted to let anyone who is interested know that they are holding
a survey over on the net at rec.auto.vw regarding splitting off the 
air cooleds from the water cooleds and (possibly) creating another 
minor group like rec.auto.vw.buses.  Check it out, if you're interested
in such things (I know I was tired of reading about Jettas and Golfs just
to read a couple of messages that related to my old bus and my love for
them.

I also have a question regarding the origin of my '64 camper.  The guy I
bought it from said the previous and original owner has picked it up in
Europe and that it was the Euro' version of the Westy camper.  The 
interior is all done up with blonde colored wood and is mostly solid
wood (no plywood).  It has facing seats with a removable table and a fold-
down table on one door.  The seats re-arrange into a bed, with the two 
seat-backs coming off to create the forward-most bed section.  One 
seat-back is thinner than the other, so the German engineers added hinged
flip-up supports that raised this section to level with the bed (the 
seat-back is thinner to account for the spare wheel well extending into 
the rear passenger area).  The camper also has a wardrobe for hanging
clothes, cabinets for folding clothes, an ice-box (not powered), lots of 
under-seat storage.  It also has a hatch that opens up above the forward 
door in the rear area so you can stand up inside while getting dressed 
without getting out of the bus.  Finally, it came with the linkages for 
a side canopy (cover is missing), but there are four fittings that the 
linkages fit into, and only the front and rear ones are needed (I have
yet to figure out what the other (inner) fittings are for.  Unbelievably,
I found a front bumper in a junk yoard with the bracket for the canopy 
linkage, but I am not sure if the rear bumper had a similar bracket, as
the bus had no bumpers when I got it.

Any info would be appreciated.

Thanks,

terry ('64 camper

                   '65 bus, and '75 Westy)
