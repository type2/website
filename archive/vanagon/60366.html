to a
 minor mishap in 95, i.e., we rolled it.)
 
 The Platinum's corroded and wore so badly that after 6 months they were
 useless.  I'm really not sure why.  Both local Dealer (West Side VW) parts
 guys, and several other reputable contacts I know said stick with the stock
 plug.  I'm now on stock plugs, and will see how they wear after a month or
 two.  &gt;&gt;

Wow!!!  I'm shocked at the short life of your platinums.  Our 88 is on it's
third set now at over 120,000 miles.  I just put them in a few months ago
making over 50,000 miles for each of the first two sets.  Similar performance
in my 87.
