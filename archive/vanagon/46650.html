Thanks, but I'm not the one with the problem, I was helping someone else out.

&gt;James,
&gt;
&gt;I had the same problem occur on my 88 Westie.  Check to see if you have
&gt;the AUTO SHUT OFF type valve, I cant remember the manufactures name, I
&gt;do beleive that it was standard equipment on, or around our year vans!
&gt;If you have the auto shut off valve you may well find as I did that it
&gt;is KAPUT.
&gt;
&gt;When I got mine replaced by Globe Propain in CA the old guy told me that
&gt;the Auto Shut Off type valves have been nothing but trouble since their
&gt;introduction, better off without this c*ap he told me.
&gt;
&gt;If you have tried more than one service station, chances are that
&gt;someone is doing something right.......could well be your valve!
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
