Subject: 1989 Syncro for sale

This is my first participation on the list.  If this message goes to the
wrong place, I apologize.

       I have a 1989 Vanago Syncro Weekender (non-westie) for sale.  Have
spent thousands keeping it running since It is one of the most functional,
comfortable and fun vehicles I have ever owned.  However, I need to move on.

It has 186000 miles on it but the engine compression is excellent with no
leaks that haven't been fixed.  New clutch at 105000 miles, new cables here
and there, new exhaust, new water pump and a hundred other items that add
up.  Also, just put a rebuilt front drive line in it.  Brakes are new of
course.  Tires good.  It was (is) the fancy version with air conditioning
(works well) power windows (converted driver side to manual) power mirrors
(don't work) etc.

It does have some rust on it and could use a paint touch up.  There is also
a slight rumble noise when driving that I and my mechanics haven't been able
to pinpoint.

Anyway, I'm thinking of selling it for around $5000 unless someone wants to
pay more for it.  Also, considering the price of good used parts, I may be
willing to take it apart and sell the pieces, if enough revenue could be
generated.  (EG: I needed a new wheel and since these are the fancy ones I
was lucky to find a used one for $200 - new are $400.)


If interested email me at rgilmour_at_ditell_dot_com or call me at (801) 649-1161.
The van is in Park City, Utah  (Salt LAke City).  I may be taking a drive
trip to Vermont in October, and would be willing to deliver it back east if
someone were interested.
