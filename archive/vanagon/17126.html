Subject: Parts from the Bus Stop

     hi Bus-Stop fans,
     
     I have also got their catalogue and it looks good - and they seem nice 
     and helpfull when you call. They seem quite happy about sending stuff 
     to the UK.
     
     One question though...
     
     I like the look of their -&gt;'67 chrome bus door handles and I just 
     wondered if anyone has seen/bought any chrome handles off them. I 
     assume that the handles are reproduction ones at that price (25$ each) 
     about I just wondered about the quality and its not clear whether the 
     handles are actually chrome or not - I've heard that they are painted 
     black.
     
     anyone know,
     
     Lee.
