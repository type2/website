Subject: VWUS Came Through

I just returned from Star VW after speaking to the VW rep.  They 
will cover 80% of the head expense since I was the original owner 
and serviced the the van regularly.  He said that each situation 
will be judged individually.  I'm well satisfied, the 86 Syncro has 
over 96K.
