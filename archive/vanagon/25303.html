&gt;anyone have experience with the &quot;PC 300&quot; model 110v inverter?  They 
&gt;are about 70$ now and was wondering if anyone has used it.

Yes, I got that one from Damark catalog (thanks to Bradley). However, I
have not extensively tested it yet. Tried to plug in an old electric drill
but apparently 300W continuous was not enough. It ran for a second, then
the buzzer went on and the power supply was cut off. David S. has the next
larger model and is satisfied as far as I know. Alledgedly, he even runs a
microwave oven with that. 

If you want, I'll submit it to more tests this weekend.

&gt;it is rated for 500watts intermittent and i've heard either 300w or 
&gt;150w continuous...  seems there's a disparity in the rating.

I guess that would be the PC 150.
