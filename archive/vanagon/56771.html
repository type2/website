First of all, you should go bug VWoA to do the SU recall campaign to your
a/c roof vents - the metal brackets to keep this from hitting your head -
doesn't sound like it's been done.  If they insist that it has then show
them the fallen roof vents.

Second, don't know the direction of flow for dryer, but if necessary I
could consult the Bentley tonight.

Third, sounds familiar, my a/c blew the &quot;service valves&quot; from too much
pressure (freon got too hot probably due to the head gasket problem at the
time).  Sounds like your &quot;relief valve&quot; could be the same thing - just
different terms from different dealers.  Valves are very inexpensive, but
be certain to evacuate the system now that it is open.

Fourth, 15 second running time for the fan sounds normal, and yes it is a
two-stage system.  The low speed radiator fan is supposed to run all the
time when the a/c is on.

Fifth, consult the archives as there was some mention of a resistor switch
(or something electronic) that could be the problem.  Someone whose spent
even more than I have on the a/c posted this suggestion back in December.
Someone else even posted that you can use a $25 (Ford?) dryer on the
Vanagon.

On a hot day last summer the pressure relief valve on my AC dryer gave
out.  When it goes out it makes a startling noise and sight,
particularly when your standing right next to it.  I replaced the dryer
assembly and expansion valve with only one problem. The old dryer was
not marked as to the direction of flow of freon through the hoses.  The
new dryer will fit on in both direction. The van is a 1987 Wolfsburg
with 2.1? gas engine.  The one with the AC ducts that swing down and
smack you in the back on the head when you hit a good bump.
  1. Can someone please tell me the direction of flow for dryer
assembly?
  2. The goof I asked to check out the AC said that dryer pop off
valves    sometimes wear out.   I don't think I buy that one!  There
must         be an under lying cause for the pressure to build up.
  3. My vanagon has never indicated that it was hot.  But I have
noticed   that the cooling cycle is different than it used to be.  Now
the fan only runs for 15 sec at a time.  It may run several
times, but
for only 15 sec.    Is that a two stage system?
I guess it's off to the money suckers if I can not figure this one out.
Thank you for any suggestions.
