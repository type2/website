Subject: Forget the Drums, How do you get the Lug nuts OFF!

Item Subject: Text_1
     Hi All,
     
       Well I attempted to put to use all the good advice I got on how to 
     pull (maybe hammer would be a better description) the drums off the 
     '85 Vanagon.  However, I naively assumed it would be easy to get the 
     wheels off--I could not remove even one of the lug nuts.   I have 
     tried penetrating oil soaked over night, heat from a propane torch, &amp; 
     a six point impact socket and 2 foot breaker bar.  None of these have 
     even allowed me to get a slight turn out of any of the nuts.  I even 
     looked in the owners manual to see if I was turning the nuts the 
     correct direction.  Looks like the previous mechanic did not use anti 
     seize on the studs--may the fleas of a thousand camels infest his/her 
     arm pits.
       I am about ready to bring it to a shop so they can use the air guns 
     on it--if they are this stuck are the air guns likely to break a stud? 
     Can you replace a single stud?  Judging from the lugs nuts, it's not 
     going to be pretty getting the drums off either--so maybe the shop is 
     the best option.  Any advice on this situation?  
     
     TIA,
     
     Vince
