Subject: Quad driving light grille on SA Vanagon (pics)

Hi, All - 
check this website out (courtesy of Tony Moore)

http://moorelab_dot_com/vw/grille/chrisvw.htm

I gave him a picture of a Vanagon with the type of Quad headlamp / driving light
setup used on current South African Vanagons  (yes, they still make them there -
only they call them &quot;Buses&quot; / &quot;Caravelles&quot; and they have the Audi inline 5 ( EV
engine) in back instead of the wasserboxer) 

Anyway, this is similar ( I know this is image is a LITTLE large :&lt;)  and the
van wasn't in the greatest shape, but I'm sure you all will get the idea..) to
the grille that I'm thinking of bringing a bunch of over 
&quot;a-la-Forhan&quot; style (to save on shipping costs), IF, that is  IF I get enough
positive response. Unlike the picture, the grille will be of the &quot;newer&quot;
('88-'91) style with the larger VW symbol and fewer and thicker louveres, fins,
tines or whatever you want to call those things. It still will fit all '80-'91
Vanagons, though you '86-'91 guys will have to rob an '85 down Van of it's round
headlight buckets.   As it looks now, it would be under 300 bucks for the whole
assy. Negotiations are still being made, so e-mail me if you'd be interested. 

And before any of you napalm heads light your flame throwers, this is NOT a
money making venture on my part. I was just interested in this lighting setup
for my van, and due to the current crappy SA Rand exchange rate, it seems as if
anybody else wanted one too, we could all get a good deal on shipping. 


let me know  (p.s. this ain't gonna be an overnight thing....it may take
awhile.. if it even happens...)
