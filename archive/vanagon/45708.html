Subject: Unknown noise: 77 Westy

My 77 Westy is making an intermittent noise.  It is a hollow sounding
&quot;clunk, clunk, clunk&quot; whose frequency is related to vehicle speed, not
engine speed.  At times I am sure that it is coming from the front,
but then later it seems like it is coming from the rear.  I guess that
it is simple reverberating through out the &quot;drum&quot;.

It will be silent for several days, and then make the sound during
left hand turns.  Latter on it will make the noise steadily for several
miles, but only when the clutch is disengaged (pedal up).  

I did not see anything suspicious down below, and the CV joints don't
seem to have excessive play.  What is going on?

Thanks,

Kirk Hilliard
