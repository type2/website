I have had my 81 West for about 6 mo and have had a fair shair of character
building moments. Currently though I am stressed about a very worrisome
problem. After the engine is good and warm 15-30 minutes, I start to get a
flicker in the idiot light for the oil pressure, at idle. This will get
progressively worse the warmer the engine get until it will be on almost
fully (lightly flickering) when idling. 

My mechanic and I have checked out the engine fairly thoroughly. The oil
sensor is fine (new), the oil pressure is where it should be. So not a bad
oil pump. (just so you know) Compression is 125 in the back cylinders and 115
in the front. My current options for solutions are, use 20W/50. add Slick 50
oil treatment and/or add STP oil treatment. 

Am I screwed. All the bearings in the engine are fine. No noise. I believe
that the engine experienced trauma before I got it and perhaps the case is
warped. Any other theories or advise.
