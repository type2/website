&gt; Funny, after I fixed mine, the smell went away rather quickly.  I put down
&gt; a couple of towels under my usual junk after I wiped it up a bit.  Haven't
&gt; smelled it at all after about a week after the fix.

I have no idea how long this had been leaking since the problem pre-existed
my ownership.  It was an antifreeze swamp under the back seat.  It took me
quite some time before I was convinced that the smell was coming from residual
coolant left in the floorboard and not from a very slow heater core leak and
that is why I'm the proud owner of a never-been-used heater core.
