Subject: re: '85 Vanagon with alternator problem

Hi folks,

Thanks for all the input on the alternator. The consensus is that I have a 
bad alternator. I'll have it checked out soon. For as long as I can 
remember the alt and OS2 light always came on at the proper shift reminder 
marks on the speedo. I just assumed that this was a &quot;feature&quot;. It's only 
recently that the lights would come on before the shift marks on the 
speedo.

Thanks for all the help!

Steve

Hi folks!

I know the van has an electronic governor that will cut the engine at a 
certain rpm . You are warned of this by the dash lights coming on. The 
problem I have is that the lights come on prematurely. For example, at 
45mph the lights will come on when I'm in 3rd gear (normally I think you 
should be able to go 55mph in 3rd gear). Oh, I have to explain the  engine 
is not cutting out prematurely at this speed; just that the lights are 
coming on. 

This is really no big deal but when the lights are on the alternator is no 
longer generating a charge voltage to  the battery. I go up some long 
grades with headlights and heater ablaze and I don't like the fact that 
everything is running off the battery.

What do you think? Is my alternator weak or is the brain going out? 

Thanks!

Steve
