Subject:      Eurovan Fridge Update

Like Clendening, Mera and Low, I just had the elevation kit installed on
the Norcold fridge.  (This fridge has had a troubled life - 2 burners
failed so far!)  It was burning merrily when I got to the dealer.

As well, other warranty stuff was done - stumbling when cold was due to
the failure of an air pump, crazy power door locks required the
replacement of the lock motor (second time!), Winnebago replaced the
paper blind on the sliding door (kept coming adrift, then moving
sideways in its frame and fouling the door frame), and the sliding
cupboard door latch was upgraded to the 1997 model when the old one
died.

I would be interested to know if other owners of EVCs have had the door
lock problem.

Oh yes, those infamous fan resistors went a couple of months ago.
