&gt; No the real moral dilemma here is, do you set yourself above the law 
&gt; simply because you don't believe in it.  Say for instance I don't believe 
&gt; that the murder laws actualy accomplish anything.  Does that mean that I 
&gt; may disregard them and murder at will!  I think not.  

There is one failure in your analogy.  Disregarding the &quot;murder laws&quot;
and murdering people is akin to disregarding smog laws and driving a car
that pollutes more than is allowed.  I don't think any of us want to do
that.  I myself am just arguing that it is ridiculous to fail a car that
runs cleanly because it has a non-original oil filler cap, for instance.
A better analogy might be:

Say, for instance, that I have a dull knife in my kitchen.  The law says
I may not sharpen it, because modified knives could be used as deadly
weapons.  The law says I either have to use the dull knife as is, or buy
a new, sharp one, which of course could never hurt anyone.  

Well, that's not a great analogy either, but it's the best I can do at
the moment.

&gt; If the law is bad work to change it.  

I know you will think this is a bad attitude, but I'd have a better
chance of walking on the moon than getting this law changed.

&gt; You may not disregard a law merely because it 
&gt; inconvieniences you and you believe it does no good.

I do it every day.  Have you ever driven 56mph on a freeway?
Everyone does what they feel is right, for whatever reason.  We would be
better off concentrating on our own morality than blindly following
every rule on the books.

And that's MY $.02  =)
