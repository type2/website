Subject:      how about it?

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in running some kind of
&quot;workshop&quot; during BUSES BY THE ARCH a few weeks from now? It might be a good
thing to set up a workshop at each BBTA. A good one for this time might be one
on taking out the refrigerator and cleaning it ;-) ;-) ;-)

Actually ANY topic of general interest where people could actually DO
something to their vans (for those of us who are mechanically *challenged*)
would be good. Are there any takers? If so, I can call ahead and set it up.
Lemme know.. .
