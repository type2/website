&gt; Well VW friends, it looks like VW has done it again.  It appears that the 
&gt; heater boxes for the 1979 Transporter are one year only.  They are no 
&gt; longer available new (Why would somebody make replacements for a part 
&gt; that was only produced for eleven months??).  They resemble the '72-74 
&gt; boxes and can be modified to fit the '79.
&gt; 
&gt; However...
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know if the muffler connections on the earlier heater boxes
&gt; will match up with a 1979 exhaust system?

If I recall correctly, the 1979 engine had squarer (&quot;vanagon&quot;) exhaust
ports, and so none of the earlier heater boxes will fit.  The later
ones should fit though...
