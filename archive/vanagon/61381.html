Listees,

I pulled off my left tail light unit, and to my surprise, a plastic
ridge on the back of the unit had cut through the outer insulation on
the air conditioning hose, and was in the process of cutting into the
actual hose.  It would have been only a matter of time before the hose
was cut open.  I took a utility knife, cut the ridge down flush,
duct-taped up the hose, and duct-taped it out of the way.  

This may be a one-of-a-kind fluke, but you might want to check your
vans, too.
