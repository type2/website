Subject: RE: tinting vanagon windows

In response to the question posted about tinting vanagon windows (medium vs dark):

I've had two vanagons tinted ('84 and '90) and found that, for the area where I live, the darker tint is 
best. Summer gets HOT in San Diego, and the dark tint keeps things nice and cool in there. I usually keep a 
surfboard of two in the back of my '90, and the tinting keeps the wax from melting and the boards out of 
sight. It's also a nice private place to change into and out of my wetsuit! (I know, I know... all this 
surf talk is hard to relate to for most of you, but hopefully you get the picture about the positive 
aspects of darkening the windows...Also, a vanagon really is the best surf vehicle around - lots of 
space, good mileage. Oh, for a syncro Westy...). When I had the '84 done, I took the 'low bid' route, and 
was sorry. The place that applied the tinting film did a poor job of cleaning the windows, and the film 
bubbled in little places within about a year. So, my advice is pay a little extra to someone who will do 
the job right, or (if you're brave) do it yourself.
