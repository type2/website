&gt;You mean not everyone igorned that thread like me?  8-)  (sarc. intended)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Amen!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, can anyone tell me when European busses ceased to have
&gt;&gt; semaphores.  I saw a green kombi with the same taillights as my '57,
&gt;&gt; but not turn signals, and I couldn't see any semaphores by the doors.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Odd!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I'll guess that they stopped the same year as the bugs--1960

i think they may have stayed on until 61 or maybe even 62?? don't know
exactly but i think the euro busses stopped using semaphores around this
time??
