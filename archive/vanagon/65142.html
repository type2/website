My wife and I love Baxter State.  Unfortunately we were on our way up there
this July when our '87 Westy died on us (in Bangor).  Sucked to be us.  We
had to rent a Subaru at the airport for the week ($500), buy a tent, stove
and stuff like that.  When we finally got to the park we realized we had left
90% of our clothes in the van, as well as our cooking &amp; eating utensils.

What a disaster,  It was also our first family vacation with our new son (5
mos. at the time).  Anyway we are in the process of buying a '90 Westy and
can't wait to head up there successfully next summer.

Peace,
Rob
