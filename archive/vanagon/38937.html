&gt;  According to Piaget linear concrete thinking stops being a problem
&gt;  at
&gt;about age 5 or 6 when we learn to use abstract concepts.  Get over
&gt;it!

no wonder i have so much trouble with the real world!!! i never
learned to use them abstract concepters ... kept poking myself in the
eye with them! :( so i just use the regular concepts. it's not as
fast, but then, my reality doesn't fray along the edges (like it does
when you use abstract concepts).

and what's all this &quot;linear concrete&quot; stuff?? everybody down here
knows that concrete is FLAT. period. flat, flat, flat. well ... unless
you make a pillar or something with it. and the sides of it are still
flat!

fences are linear.

so where do concrete fences fit in?
