&gt;The correct metric tire size for your bus is a 185/70R14.  The bus/camper is
&gt;a one-ton truck (payload capacity).  These are required to use light truck
&gt;tires as a result.  Almost noone in the tire industry realizes or cares
about
&gt;this requirement.  Therefore, many vans &amp; busses run around on &quot;substandard&quot;
&gt;rubber.  Most tires today seem to be  overbuilt so it's a moot point anyway.
&gt; You said that you currently use 195/70R14 tires on your camper AND the
&gt;speedometer is reading fast, and you are looking to go to yet a larger
&gt;diameter tire???   Listen to this carefully....
&gt;
&gt;When you go to a larger first number you are going to a wider tire.  185
&gt;refers to 185mm in tread width.  195 refers to 195mm tread width, etc.   The
&gt;middle number refers to the sidewall height in relation to the tread width.
&gt; 70 would be 70% of 185  = 129.5mm of sidewall height.  70 would also be 70%
&gt;of 195  = 136.5mm of sidewall height.  The difference between the 185 and
the
&gt;195 70's would be a 14mm difference in overall tire height.  Not much
&gt;difference, you say??
&gt;
&gt;

This information is incorrect.  The original tires were 185/r14.  The lack of
an aspect ratio in the number indicates the tire is actually a 185/82-14.
 This tire has a diameter of 25.6 inches.  In a 70 series, you actually need
a 215/70-14 tire to get the same diameter.  In 86, VW started using a
reinforced 205/70-14 as an option.  It is very important to match not only
diameter but also the payload.  The wieght rating is listed on the tire
sidewall.  Note that the federal government now says that when using pasenger
car tires on a light truck, the sidewall rating must be reduced by 10%.  This
in not a problem for early busses, but vanagons must be careful.  Especially
syncros with thier GVWR of 5515 lbs.
