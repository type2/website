Subject: Re: syncro

Need advice!

We're in way northern Cal. and saw the note on the syncro with 90k miles at a
dealership in way southern Cal.  Thinking of offering a trade for our newly
gotten 91 GL westy that only has 60k miles.  It's about 10 or 12 hours drive
for us and buying a vehicle blind is scarey.  If we're really serious, a kind
soul that lives about an hour away  has offerred to possibly check it out for
us. We've been wanting a syncro because the snow in the mountains makes it
tough to drive around here.  I'm sure we'd use it but 25,000 bucks for a
vehicle with 90k on it?!  Should we be serious?
