Subject: Mail order source for Michelin MXL's

&gt;  ...                           The MXL reinforced are $63 each and are your
&gt;best bet on the Vanagon since Conti discontinued their Vanagon tire. Shipping
&gt;for 4 is $27.24-total is $279.24

I've been calling every tire dealer in the area and its amazing how the
quality of information varies.  I ask for a 185R14 reinforced and get ...
&quot;you're missing the middle number&quot; or &quot;what do you mean, reinforced&quot; or
&quot;whats a vangoon&quot;.  Its refreshing when you finally get someone who really
knows the vehicle.

Anyway, the ones who know what I'm talking about, all point me at the
Michelin XZX reinforced (185R14) as the replacement for the MXL.  Does
anyone know the difference between the two?  The best price on XZX that
I've found is 83.95$ per tire (includes mounted, balanced, new valves, and
disposal of old tire).  This is basically the same as the MXL price.
