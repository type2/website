Subject: Re: Brake questions...

&gt;4) brakes.  I read with interest kyle's description of a failing master
&gt;cylinder.  Here are my symptoms.  Remember, '78 with power brakes.  Basically,
&gt;brake pedal height varies.  sometimes pedal height is high and brakes are firm,
&gt;other times pedal is somewhat low and brakes seem slightly spongier, but not
&gt;air-in-the-lines spongy.  Braking pedal effort is always low, i.e. power assist
&gt;works fine.  What may cause this condition?  drum brakes out of adjustment
&gt;maybe?  failing master cylinder?  I really hate brake work but if my master
&gt;cylinder is going to suddenly fail, I want to do something about it.

I replaced the front calipers,rotors,master cylinder, booster and front
hoses on my '71 last summer. Braking has been wonderful since then (I went
for too long without a power booster!!), but recently, 10,000 miles since
the installation of the new hardware and 15,000 miles since I last adjusted
the rear shoes,  my pedal has dropped an inch or two and it looks about time
to adjust the rear shoes (no spongy feel here, just normal adjustment time).  

My recent problem is similar to what Sean described above: the occasional
experience of a very hard pedal feel (pedal height high) usually after the
some driving after the brakes have heated up. The pedal then has very little
travel and feels very stiff.  The condition reoccurs ocassionally and then
reverts back to the increased pedal travel (but not at all spongy) which I
attribute to the unadjusted rear shoes.  I haven't done the rear adjustment
yet, but I'm guessing that the rears are so woefully far out of adjustment
that the valve (compensating/proportioning??--I'm forgetting the name) that
equalizes pressure from the front to the rear can't do its job and the front
pads are doing all the stopping work.  Is it possible that this valve is
responding to the huge travel distance difference that the rear shoes have
as opposed to the front pads and is sticking closed, forcing the calipers to
do all the work, effectively bypassing the rear hydraulic system and causing
the high pedal condition? (This is pure speculation--I'm seeking
illumination (flames?!).  Do I have the function of this valve--that's
bolted to the frame--I believe, correct?).

Also on the topic of brakes, I followed the recent star adjuster/brake
thread with some interest.  If I remember correctly, the little metal tabs
that are riveted to the block beneath the star adjusters to hold them in
adjustment are probably rusted off on both my rear drums.  I don't suppose
there is a source for just this part---I'd hate to replace the backing plate
for something so fixable.  If there is no part available, anyone have ideas
for fabricating something to do the job?


Thanks,
