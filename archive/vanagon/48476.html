&gt;The catalog on rebuilt drive shafts says the aircooled shafts are
&gt;shorter than the watercooled model of the same year, the drive shafts
&gt;are $ 125.00 each exchange at wholesale, as if anybody knows what

Bentley says on manual trans shafts are 547.8 mm both sides, on auto
left/right are different lengths.  No difference air/H2O!  Parts Place
catalog shows same shaft '79-92 !!!! and  list shafts at $125 retail :).
Something's wrong with the catalog you have.  Tim Smith
