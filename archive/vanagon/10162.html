Subject:       Looking for a bus

I'm looking for a VW bus.  I will be travelling throughout the Yukon 
Territory for two months this summer, collecting biological 
specimens, and a bus would be about the right size.  It would be 
ideal if it were mechanically reliable, so that I don't have to worry 
too much about being stranded in the middle of nowhere too often.  
I'm living in Nova Scotia, Canada right now, but will be heading west 
and north in mid-April.  I could pick up a vehicle anywhere en route. 
It would probably be best if it were near here or at least in Canada, 
but whatever would be great, if I can get a good deal ($).  ANy input 
as to what is a good deal would maybe be good too.  The bus doesn't 
need to be at all camperized, as I will be tenting most of the time 
anyways, I just need the enclosed space for my equipment if the wind 
or weather is really bad.  So, if you can help me out in any way, 
that would be really grand.
Thank you so much.
