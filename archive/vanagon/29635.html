Subject: re: red lights

As cool as red-orange guages and indicator lights might look, there is no
real advantage in a automotive application. In aircraft or on a ship, there
is a lot less white light ( headlights, oncomming traffic, etc), so the red
lights can protect night vision. With a car dash, you can actually loose
readability by going to red or red-orange. There are many human factors
studies to prove this, but try to tell any trendy automotive designer this
and he or she will say &quot;But it looks so cool!&quot;
