Subject: RE: Vanagon Alternator Wires

I took Dennis' advice and added an additional #4 wire from the alternator
down to the big 00 aught (spelling?) battery wire going to the transmission.
Spliced it on to that wire with a bugnut. Soldered all connections with a
blow torch &amp; solder and then shrinkwrapped.

At 10:03 PM 3/24/97 -0600, you wrote:
&gt;One larger wire would be stiff and increase the possibility of breakage at the 
&gt;connections.  Especially with all the movement a Vanagon engine has to offer.  
&gt;These wires though are still too small to carry the full output of the 
&gt;alternator without heating up and causing an excessive voltage drop.  I run 
&gt;another #8 wire from the alternator to the fuse box.  Makes a noticeable 
&gt;difference in light brightness.

&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps someone can tell me why there are two wires going from the
&gt;alternator to the starter (and main battery) instead of one FAT one?  As
&gt;far as the wiring diagram shows, they come from the same place and go to
&gt;the same place.  Is it for redundancy or leftovers from an older stock
&gt;system?  Would a larger gauge wire affect current flow or something like
&gt;that?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
