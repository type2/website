Subject: emissions equip for 73 Bus
Date: Thu, 20 Oct 94 14:31:34 PDT

So Steve Lindley says:
&gt; 
&gt; I need some info on what emmissions equipment my 73 Bus needs to become a 
&gt; legal CA resident (it is visiting from NC).  It seems to have nothing beyond 
&gt; exhaust pipes, and has a single Weber-style carb.  I also have a 74 914 
&gt; engine that does have an EGR valve, but also has some sort of Weber-style 
&gt; single carb.  The people at the two smog places I took it to were basically 
&gt; appalled, and told me to junk it.  The bus is in pretty good shape and I'd 
&gt; rather drive it around some more or sell it, rather than send it to the 
&gt; scrap heap.  Anybody know what I need to put back, or where I can take it to 
&gt; get it smogged, or any other course of action?  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

Sounds like yours is a prime candidate for the smog exemption.  Just pay
up to the limit (yours is probably ~ $50.00) to fix whatevery you can
and then you get a sticker that says you are exempt.  The gotcha is that
you'll have to pay this fee every time you get it smogged which is every
other year now in California I believe.  You can mooch smog parts from
wrecking yard vehicles and attach them to yours except, your heads 
won't accept the heat pump tubing that attaches to the heads.  

To be CA smog equipped you need the EGR valves (2) that attach to the
manifolds.  A heat pump (smog pump) Various hoses and anti-backfire
valve, EGR filter and tubing.  Pretty gruesome eh?  Well, it can
be done but someone else was trying to get the EGR valves for a '73
for a while.  Don't remember the end of the story.  From the dealer?
Forget it!  ;)

Cheers!
