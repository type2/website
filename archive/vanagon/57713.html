Hi Karen, I've had exactly the same problem and tried a number of different
fixes. The two metal plates are supposed to rub together but if you put
some grease on one of the rings it will stop the grating noise with no
adverse affect!!

&gt; Hi !
&gt; You have helped us in the past,  maybe you can again. Our 85 westie 
&gt; steering wheel makes a scraping sound everytime we turn it. We have 
&gt; taken the plastic cover off the column and cleaned out any grime we 
&gt; saw, this stopped the noise for about 2 days and now the noise is 
&gt; back. We see the two metal plates rubbing against each other is this 
&gt; the way it is supposed to be?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
