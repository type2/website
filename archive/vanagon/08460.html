&gt;My reverse light is currently operated from a switch on the dash, I would like
&gt;to return the operation of the light to the gear stick as originally.
&gt;I have pottered through the Haynes manual, but cannot find the location of the
&gt;original switch. Nor by crawling around under my bus can I find it - but I
&gt;enjoy doing this anyway :)
&gt;Does anyone know the secret location of the switch on a '73 Kombi 1700?

ha! :) it SHOULD be on the transmission. as i recall, it's up 'front' toward
the small end of the transmission, on the left side (assuming your shift
pattern is the same as ours: reverse being engaged by pushing down and over
to the left and back).  it's a small 'bump' on the transmission with some
wires coming out of it.

the switches have been known to go 'bad', hence the switch on the dash
(probably by the Dreaded Previous Owner). so you might want to try a test
for continuity throught the switch ... before you start popping fuses and
such (after hooking the switch into the circuit).
