Well Joel, you can finally add me to your list. 1980 Vanagon, (cinnamon
brown), camper, in WA state.
Everything checked out okay. I filled it up and drove it the roughly 25
miles home (over the bridge and across the ferry though!)
Pulling up the road toward my house, hit the brakes and the damn brake
light came on. I sure wish I would have at least gotten it into the
driveway before the first problem hit!
So anyway, a real mechanic and myself both looked at the wheels and didn't
notice sign of leakage. the brakes feel fine - they don't pump up really,
but if you do pump them the light doesn't come on it seems. Opened up the
dash to look at the master cylinder (nice of them to put that plastic tray
around it to prevent spillage) and it's right at the max line.  There are
some indications that a little brake fluid has been under it in the past,
and a slight bit of &quot;dampness&quot; where the reservoir meets the vacuum assist.
Had the owner been topping it off? I don't know - I'll call tomorrow and
see but I doubt it - the previous owner just took it to a garage anytime
something went wrong.
But why does the light come on if the level is full? And is it really safe
to drive? (My Volvo has dual circuits - when it came on there we knew we
still had two good wheels - this thing only has one tank within the master
cylinder reservoir so I presume that means there's only one.)

I sure hope this isn't a sign...

Rick
