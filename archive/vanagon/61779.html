Could be the voltage stabilizer - but don't weight the coolant gauge reading 
too much - my '91 regularly reads below (like yours) - but my '87 nearly 
always reads above. (This often indicates radiator partly plugged from head 
corrosion debris.)

Check the instrument panel first - pulling the tank to get the sender is a 
pain - there is a cross-tank vent line that runs OVER plumbing under the car - 
so you have to pull the fittings for it out of at least one side in order to 
drop the tank. This often means replacing at least one seal - and possibly a 
vent fitting if it cracks. (Had to pull a tank to cure a fuel smell from a 
cracked fitting.)

	Additional information, normal operating temp according to the 
	coolant temperature gauge is above the warning light... since
	the voltage stabilizer serves both gauges, looks like I'll be 
	looking at it for a starting point. (my coolant temp &quot;norm&quot;
	is our '91 Carat whose gauge reads below the warning light...)
