Subject:       '57 Deluxe Saga Update

Yes, the ownership of my '57 is a saga.  Much like those trashy 
romance novels you'd read which have the titles of states (ie. 
Utah!).  But getting on with things!

My bus had been running hot.  I'd not been driving it much because of 
the condition.  Just around town (pop. 5000).

Yesterday evening I took it to a great mechanic in Provo (Utah of 
course) to get the timing done.

It was advancing &gt;&gt;50&lt;&lt; degrees!  WOW!  It was at like 19 at idle!  
(This is a 1776cc with Engle 110 cam, and balanced crankshaft)
Can you believe I hadn't burned the thing up yet?  It was also 
running a little lean.

So he got it back down where it should be, and I drove off a happy 
camper--with about TWICE as much power in the middle band!
It is still running warm (can barely hold onto the dipstick), so I am 
going to locate a thermometer for sure today.

Don't know if I said that I got the bumpers on!  Looks superb!  I 
will get some photos and throw them on the web.

Also, I have upped the priority on my three-point seatbelt 
installation.  As those of you know who are also on the Audi list, I 
totalled my Quattro last week, and if it weren't for my seatbelt, I'd 
probably be a messed up little camper.  So, I want to get some soft 
of safety restraint for the Bus, even if it is more of a saftey 
blanket than anything.

Well, that's it for now!
