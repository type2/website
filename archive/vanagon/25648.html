|&gt; Got carried awat ay auction-- wife says must go.
|&gt; 
|&gt; 1956  Single Cab  6v unrestored.   Was farm truck, so looks it.  Someone
|&gt; who couldn't paint painted it, so can't tell where rust is or is not-- but
|&gt; seems remarkably rust free (for Iowa)
|&gt; 
|&gt; Owner claims has rebuilt 36 horse &amp; tranny-- but wouldn't guarantee it.
|&gt; Last run 1986.   Runs well though.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Great Project-- $1500 firm

Over on rec.auto.vw for the first time in ages and saw this
