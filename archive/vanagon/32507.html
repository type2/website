Subject: Re: Prudhoe Bay ?/top of the world tour

Hi Folks,
Had any of you &quot;top of the world&quot; folks been planning on on parting with the 
rest of the group and going to Prudhoe Bay ?  If so, let me know and 
I'll check with the public lands center and get the necessary permits.  I 
will  also offer the hospitality of my friend Larry Ballard should you 
stay in Fairbanks.  Larry has plenty of room for camping, a personal bar 
that puts most commercial bars to shame, and a yard decorated with 40+ 
bugs buses squarebacks and ghias.

Tobin, could you put me down in the maybe list?  Thanks.  Time 
permitting, I will join the convoy in Whitehorse or thereabouts.   

-Tom

&gt; Subject: BMW: Dalton Hwy (aka North Slope Haul Road)
&gt; 
&gt; For those considering riding all the way north to Prudoe Bay, AK this
&gt; summer, an article in today's Anchorage Daily News indicated that The
&gt; Fairbanks Borough voted to close the last 8 miles of the Dalton Hwy to
&gt; visitor traffic. Although contrary to the 1994 decision by the Alaska
&gt; Legislature to open the hwy to the public, it appears that dipping your
&gt; toes in the Arctic Ocean in Alaska next summer might not be an option.
