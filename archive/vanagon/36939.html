&gt;Hello to all,
&gt;
&gt;I had a mechanic install a rebuilt '78 air-cooled in my '84 Westy. The 
&gt;water-cooled did a number on itself. I'm new to VWs, but I think I *may* 
&gt;be learning fast that there are mechanics, and there are other wanna-be 
&gt;mechanics.
&gt;
&gt;I put 500 easy miles on the rebuilt engine, per the mechanics suggestion. 
&gt;Then went on a trip, w/said mechanics blessing. To make a long story 
&gt;short, I was towed a couple of hundred miles to my destination. VW 
&gt;mechainic here said I had a hole in one of the pistons. Previous mechanic 
&gt;hadn't installed all the tin (baffling?) around the air-cooled engine and 
&gt;it overheated.
&gt;
&gt;1st mechanic sez &quot;enough&quot; tin is there. The rest is a dust barrier. 
&gt;Folks, there was a good 4 or 5 inches of opening all around the engine. I
&gt;have installed aluminum sheeting the best I could to block this opening. 
&gt;
&gt;My question to all you experienced VW owners;  How tight does the metal 
&gt;work need to be around the engine? Do you agree with the 2nd mechanic, 
&gt;and my feelings, the 1st mechanic was negligent in not installing more 
&gt;tin? He, #2 guy, has agreed to take care of the engine. I paid a bundle 
&gt;to have him do the original work and I think I've learned something from 
&gt;the experience. But I want to be able to continue with my plans to knock 
&gt;around the countryside in my little Westy camper. I'm on Soc Sec 
&gt;disability and can't afford to be ripped off.
&gt;
&gt;Now that I'm on the 'net and reading you guys, I should be able to avoid 
&gt;this in the future. Thanks a million for any and all comments you care to 
&gt;make.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Ron....I *think* I'll be the proud owner of a '84 Westy *sometime*
&gt;

Question!!  Why would one pay for a rebuilt air cooled engine and pay to have
it installed in a WC Vanagon??   In addition to the tin, there are other
variables to consider.  Many air cooled vanagons regularly blow engines.  You
are probably also missing the EGR set-up.  This will cause an air colled
engine to melt heads and put holes in pistons under the right conditions.
 Also, what do you now do for heat and defrost?  Save your money and put
proper engine in there.  You'll be happier in the end.
