&gt;I'm surprised no one has offered opinions on the morality of this.
&gt;Emissions tests exist to keep our air clean.  Bypassing them seems a very
&gt;selfish thing to do.


==================

I believe it was St. Muir himself who pointed out that regulating 
*percentages* of various chemicals components of emissions as a means to 
lessen air pollution is, at best, moronic.

A &quot;70's loaf, even one moderately in need of a tune-up, while not being 
able to meet emissions percentage benchmarks is still probably ACTUALLY 
PRODUCING a fraction of the pollution that a fully emissions-compliant 
Toyota LandCruiser is dumping into the atmosphere.

 If the government tried to regulate speed limits in the same way they 
try to regulate emissions, it would be perfectly legal to roar through a 
school zone at 65mph if the next time you were on the interstate you went 
20mph for a couple of miles   =8^D

Essentially, to question the morality of complying with emissions laws as 
they exist, one must first assume that they actually function as 
intended; the reality is that they do not.
