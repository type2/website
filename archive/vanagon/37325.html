&gt;&gt;Buzzing down the freeway this past week, I saw a Vanagon called a &quot;Carat&quot;
--
&gt;
&gt;&gt;what is it?
&gt;
&gt;Carat refers to a specila interior and trim package.  Was start of the rear
&gt;facing fold up,(theather) style seats ans center table.  Usually had
&gt;aerodynamic(joke) trim package.
&gt;
The rear facing seats and fold up table started (in non-Westy models) with
the '87 Wolfsburg Edition, &amp; continued with the '88 Wolfsburg Edition.  These
were so popular (in relative Vanagon terms) that VW offered the Carat in '89,
'90, &amp; '91 that offered the same interior package in a distinct model that
was available all year long.
