Subject: how does listserver work?

Vanagon Folks:

I recently joined this list server and am dismayed to find out that it is 
forwarding lots of individual messages, flooding my mail with lots of 
interesting but somewhat excessive information. 

Other list severs I belong to send a single message containing all individual 
message when the volume reaches a predetermined level, typically twice a day.

Is the vanagon server setup to forward individual messages by design or 
accident?

Thanks,

Tom
