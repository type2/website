&gt;Hey all,
&gt;	I have some questions about an '81 Westy (or any early
&gt;	air-cooled Vanagon for that matter).  I'm looking possibly at an
&gt;	'81 Westy which looks really nice rather than a breadloaf.  I
&gt;	wonder how many of you guys can tell me advantages/disadvantages
&gt;	to owning a Vanagon as compared to a late model breadloaf bus.
&gt;	Things like power, engine access, reliability and all that.
&gt;	Also, this Vanagon is a Westy with stove and refrig. and all
&gt;	that.  the owner says that the fridge works on 110v power but it
&gt;	doesn't work on propane power.  He says it's probably the
&gt;	ignitor.  How big a job is it to fix something like that?  Are
&gt;	the parts expensive?  Speaking of which, how reliable do the
&gt;	camping parts of Westys tend to be?  Do they break a lot or do
&gt;	they generally hold up well?  I'm asking about Vanagon Westys
&gt;	but also breadloaf Westys.  
&gt;
&gt;	Taxing the collective knowledge of the group again,
&gt;	Sean
&gt;
&gt;

If you want a Vanagon, go for a water cooled.  86 and up is best, mpre
options, power, better brakes.  Usually have power steering.  Camper A/C is
so so.  Air cooled Vanagons tend to blow engines, especially on long trips.
 Primary use of a camper.  Water cooled Vanagons do have head problems,  but
that can usually be avoided with proper care.
