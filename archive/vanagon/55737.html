 &gt;&gt; Maybe.  There is a tell-tale hole on the water pump.  Crawl under the
engine and look at the underside of the waterpump housing just below the point
where the pulley shaft comes out of the housing.  There is a 1/8 diameter
hole.
 When the waterpumps bearings are dying, this coolant will allow coolant to
comeout.  &lt;&lt;

 Thanks for the advice - it took a lot of staring lit by a halogen light but I
finally caught the bugger dripping out the weep hole.  Now to make a fast deal
on a pump.
 Thanks again for the tip!
