&gt;Wow!  Same model as The Bozobus.  Mr. Bozo is S/N 682457 - how close is
&gt;that to yours?  He is/was Dove Blue.

Hey!  Sorry so late with the reply!  Would you believe I bought mine last
July and just brought it home yesterday? (BTW, you wouldn't believe the 
looks I get whenever I tow a bus behind my '77 Westy!) I was going by 
the guy's word that I bought it from about the year of the bus, because I
couldn't get the engine lid open (church key broken off in the latch).

Well, after I got it home I look under the rear end, and that don't look
like no 1200 sitting in there.  After prodding with a hammer &amp; 
screwdriver for about 30 minutes, I finally get the lid open.  Sure
enough, there's a 36hp!!!  Grabbed the belt &amp; it turns right over.  The
engine number is 179XXX which makes the engine a '57, I believe.

The bus s/n is 501XXX which I think means it's a late '59 or early '60.
I'll have to look up the numbers when I get a chance.  This monster's
color is RUST.  (ha, ha!! LOTS of surface rust, but little rust through)
The paint looks like Sealing Wax Red, but I don't think that color was 
available on commercial vehicles.  Probably just a very faded Ruby Red.

Anyway, I've temporarily changed my sig until I find the correct date.

Later,
