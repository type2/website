So...  Not only is it warm it DOES do well in the snow in comparison?  I 
hadn't driven a rear engine bus in so long I couldn't remember to compare.

I do like my Eurovan....

&gt; Having owned just about each one of these vehicles and having driven
&gt; them in snow/ice for long periods of time, here's my rating, from best
&gt; to worst:  (All vehicles below had standard transmission)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    Best, By Far:  '93 EV  (and the '85 Audi 5000)
&gt; 
&gt;    then,       :  '82 diesel westy (not much low end torque, well
&gt; 		   distributed weight, lack of power steering also helps)
&gt; 
&gt;    then        :   73 Bus 
&gt; 
&gt;    then        :   '87 Weekender and the '73 SuperBug (too much low
&gt; 		   end torque)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Having said this, remember, any single one of these are *much* better
&gt; than a LARB under any circumstance (I've driven those, too...)...
&gt; 
&gt; Of Course, I've also driven my '85 Renault Encore  around in
&gt; Pittsburgh snow -- I think the EV would be no match to the Renault
&gt; . ( underpowered 1400 cc engine, narrow tires with good thread) in
&gt; Pittsburgh (those of you who know Pittsburgh's hills will know what
&gt; I'm talking about).
