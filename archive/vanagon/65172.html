Subject:      Luggage rack part

Well, I've successfully managed to fix the leaking gas tank and replace the
front rotors on my '88 Westfalia, and now I am very ready to move on to
easier and less grimy tasks.

My luggage rack (front of the poptop) is missing one of the chrome metal
tie-down hooks. (They are pop-riveted into the top) I asked about getting one
from the dealer, but everyone in the parts room just laughed. The parts guy
finally said, after wiping the tears from his eyes, that he would not even
bother to look it up because it would cost so much, because of shipping and
handling, that I'd never be willing to pay the outragous price VW wanted for
it.

So, does anyone on the list have any ideas? Or one of these lying around that
they do not want?

Thanks
Todd
'88 Westfalia
