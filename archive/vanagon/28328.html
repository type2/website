Subject: Clutch Tube Replacement

Hi,

	Went to tighten up the clutch tonight, and d'oh! No more
threads!  So I said what the hey, I'll just replace the cable, I have
a new one!  I get it all threaded in, back to the bowden tube, when,
d'oh!  The old bowden tube is too small - the cable won't go thru!  I was
puttingin a later style cable with a wingnut.  Out comes the new and
back in goes the old.  Drat.

	I did do one thing right tho.  I made a special wrench for
tightening the old style clutch cable nut.  I broke a check 13mm and welded
it back together at about 30 degree angle.  Looks like crap (I didn't 
do any finish work on it - it was getting dark) but it worked like a 
champ.  I now call it my runt wrench.

	So what did I do about the adjustment?  Took a slightly bigger
nut and washer and put them in front of the adjusting nut.  All better
for now!

	And now in search of the right bowden tube...

Thom
