&gt;but then, not Everybody agrees with what Muir or even Bentley says.

&gt;anyway, it's just a thought right now. lemme know what you think.

A scary thought, that, but you're right.  The logistics are a bit shy
of say, a NASA launch, but probably do-able.  If it goes through, I
wanna edit for punctuation and grammar.  The lack of writing skills in
most gearhead publs. makes me crazy.  Besides, maybe I could count it
toward my promo. to Associate Professor...
