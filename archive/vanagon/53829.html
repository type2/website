Subject: '81 Vanagon L FS, in CO $350

I have an '81 Vanagon L for sale in Denver. The motor and trans are 
already gone, but everything else is still there. It has no rust, but 
some slight damage near the left turn signaland the interior is not that 
great. I am asking $350, it has a clear CO title. I would also consider 
parting it out, if I do not sell the van as a whole. Please E-mail if 
interested. I would accept any reasonable offer.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Josh
