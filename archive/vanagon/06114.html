&gt; Hi Folks. Has anybody used these spark plugs in the Vanagons?  My '90
&gt; Syncro Westfalia just chews through the stock Bosch Supers (w7cc0).  VW
&gt; says 48000 Km or 2 years for spark plug intervals, and after 32000 Km
&gt; and a little over a year the plug gap is over 40 thou!  I bought a set
&gt; of the Bosch Platinums (wr7cp) and haven't put them in yet.  They are
&gt; supposed to be the ultimate plugs, and they will wear 2 - 3 times longer..
&gt; .so I have been told.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any experience with these plugs?  I picked up a set for
&gt; a little over $15 Can. at Canadian Tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Thx. Harry.

I have had excellent results with platinums in all my vws..Longer life 
smoother idle and better running.  This may not be true for everybody 
however, as i have read bad things as well.  However i use nothing else
