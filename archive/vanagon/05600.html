&gt; As near as I can figure, the porta-johns are simply a receptacle to hold a
&gt; large plastic bag and some sort of sewage treatment liquid. If anyone knows
&gt; different please enlighten me. Anyway, If I'm correct, I'm thinking about
&gt; something that might fit in the flip-top storage stool that came with some
&gt; mid-70s buses would look better. Now, has anyone seen one of these items in
&gt; good shape in a salvage yard somewhere? Does anyone have any experience with
&gt; portable toilets?

Clausson makes a very nice, compact, reusable porta-potty.  You do have to
get rid of those rather nasty looking gurkins first, but after that
miserable job, you're off and running (so to speak). 

Got us through 4.5 months of European circumnavigation quite handily.
