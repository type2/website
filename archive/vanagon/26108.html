Subject: Speedo Cable--HELP!!!

OK--Just started to hear that dreaded speedo cable noise and the needle 
started to bounce.  I need help.

Is there a way to Lubricate the cable with out removing everything??

How can I solve this problem quickly before the cable breaks or 
something else happens.

This is in my 76 Westy.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks

Joe
