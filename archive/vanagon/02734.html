I need to replace the forward bush on the rear part of the linkage. That 
probably sounds a bit confusing, its the one in the front chassis 
crossmember. The Haynes manual says that the gearbox has to come out to 
remove that part of the linkage since it can only be removed rearwards. Does 
the linkage have to be removed to change the bush or does anyone know of an 
easier way? I can live with the slop if it means dropping the engine and 
'box to fix it.
