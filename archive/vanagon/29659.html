Subject: Sharan (one last time)

I see that the Sharan in town *is* part of the cold weather testing 
group, just thought i'd clarify that.

Got stuck behind a caravan of Caravans (6 of 'em) doing Chrysler's
cold weather testing... didn't get hit by any loose body parts
flying off them but i DID notice a peculiar smell......
