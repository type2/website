Subject: armrest fix for idiots

I thank all the list Volks for their help re my collapsed front seat armrest!
 It's certainly great to discover such a supportive community.

Since I have a simple mind, I look for simple solutions...  Yesterday, before
trying to remove the arm as per all the good advice, I found a tiny, almost
paper-thin adjustable wrench in my tools.  I simply grabbed the loose
flathead screw by its threads, turned it a number of times- and now have a
functioning armrest!!!

Tally-ho   ;-)
