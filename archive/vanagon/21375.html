Subject: Gas Heater for '82
Date: Sat, 22 Jul 95 10:41:26 EDT

We are in the market for an auxiliary gas heater for a 1982 Westfalia Vanagon.
The van is from California and did not have the gas heater feature, so we
would be interested in the whole set up (heater, switches, and
underplate). We would also prefer to buy a used one in good shape. We do
not want to pay more for the heater than we paid for the van and so the
new ones are out of the question.

Thanks for any leads or offers.

David C.
