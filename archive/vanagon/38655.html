I realize that this is not totally van related...but the theories and 
concepts do apply...

&gt;From Friday April 12 thru Monday April 15 (or Tuesday, April 16) I am going 
to be doing some major work on my '56 Beetle. I figure I would &quot;share&quot; this 
experience with anyone out there who hasn't either turned a wrench on a VW 
or hasn't gotten into some of the &quot;major&quot; areas.

Here's what's up. My transmission is acting &quot;sick&quot; (even sicker than its 
owner 8-)  &lt;-obligitory humor here...) so the engine has to come out, etc. 
As I began to walk thru the process, and compared the process to the parts I 
have on hand and would need, this taks suddenly grew to the following:

1. Remove Engine. While the engine is out it would be nice to clean the 
INSIDE of the engine tin. While the engine tin is off, I have to replace the 
sealing rings between the heads and cylinders (I re-used the ones on there 
now and I'm getting some exhaust smell in the heater).

2. Remove and Replace Tranny. This will include replacing all mounts, seals 
and boots.

3. Replace Brake Components. Because the tranny is being removed, the brake 
system has to be &quot;opened&quot;. So its a good time to replace the 20 year old 
wheel cylinders with new ones...and if I have to do that, then the brake 
shoes probably need doing...

4. Replace link/king pins. If I have to pull apart the front brakes, it 
doesn't take much of a stretch to do the link/king pins. I have a rebuilt 
set sitting around...

So there you have it. I'm in Dartmouth, Mass....outside of New Bedford...35 
miles from Providence, and 60 miles south of Boston.

Its a great opportunity to get your hands &quot;dirty&quot;.

E-mail me if interested.

Ric
