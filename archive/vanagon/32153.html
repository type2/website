Subject: Used Bus Bits page update
Date: Sat, 06 Jan 1996 14:43:34 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


&quot;Rodney L. Boleyn&quot; &lt;boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com&gt; made the suggestion of
also indexing by year, so I've added that.  Also, the values in the
indices are now sorted.  The order of the actual entries is still
relatively random.

I've actually been asked to take stuff off the list, because it's been
sold.  This is a good thing, as it means people are finding the page
useful.

A reminder:  If you want a listing on the Used Bus Bits page, you must
mail it to me (dworkin_at_village_dot_org) directly.  I typically ignore for-
sale and looking-for postings on the list, as they tend to remind me
that I paid too much for my '58....
