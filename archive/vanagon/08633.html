&gt;  Why not just buy a blown up 71 dual port engine for the parts (shrouds,
&gt; stands, manifold, etc.) and then buy a really nice long block DP?  It
&gt; would be a lot cheaper than a complete turn-key.  Wouldn't a 71 engine fit
&gt; into 70 bay?

	The most significant reason I don't do this is fear of the
smog stuff. I'm not very lucky in evading legal requirements, so if
I call the engine a '71' then I'll have to show them the EGR, etc.
that a real 71 has. But fear is often based on lack of knowlege,
so step one, still not done is talk to the smog refs. Perhaps today.
