&gt;         Looked at a '59 today here in Austin (I believe it was posted to
&gt; the list a few days back) and it has some hardcore cancer. Down by the
&gt; jackpoints (or where the jackpoints are on a baywindow, I'm assuming they
&gt; remain constant) there are holes about 2-3&quot; wide. This is on the
&gt; crossmembers that the floorpan rests on. Hardcore. Seems to me this is real
&gt; difficult to repair, any thoughts? The fellow has done a decent job on the
&gt; interior, it's in pretty fair shape, just a few spots with water damage.
&gt; Cute paint job too, real hippied out. The wife loves it, but I'm afraid
&gt; it's beyond me since I can't weld.

Anyone can weld.

Look at my '54 to see a real rust case.
