Hope the list is really working now.

When I was replacing my coolant, I found that a dime placed between the 
throttle stop screw and the hammer seemed to hold the engine at 
2,000-2,500 RPM quite well.  No part number on this item, though.

The person that sold me my '85 Vanagon was able to crack my stuck oil 
drain bolt.  Issue resolved and I now have 4.5 quarts of rassuring Mobil 
1 in my crankcase along with a real live VW filter.  No flames, please, 
after 150,000 miles on my '85 Jetta and Mobil 1, I'm sold on the stuff.

The Bridgestones are great, so far.  The Van seems much less susceptible 
to the cross-winds on the freeway and I don't have to endure the 
embarassment of the whitewalls that came on it any longer.  Any sources 
for new wheel covers that isn't my friendly dealer?  Mine look pretty 
ratty.

Last month on this list, someone had mentioned putting a Ford O2 sensor 
in as a replacement for the expensive factory item.  Does this really 
work?  If it does, could I get the part number again?

Last question: Just what is considered to be an &quot;abuse&quot; of this list? --
