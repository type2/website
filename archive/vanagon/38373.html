Subject: Re: RE: Burning Buses

&gt;Unfortunately, saw a mid-70s camper catch on fire this weekend (next to a 
gas
&gt;pump, of all places).  When I inquired, the station attendent said the 
cause
&gt;was that it &quot;backfired.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The question:  What is it that makes these buses burn?
----
my 73 camper had a 77 fi motor in it.  After a few years with long summer
road trips i wore the thing out.  On thing it did in it's final throes was to
backfire and shoot flames out the tailpipe.  It only did this a couple times,
but hm, i suppose that could help a bus catch fire.
