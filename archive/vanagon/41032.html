Subject: '64 Bus/camper int. For sale

Howdy all, I am posting this for a friend, so please call him directly.
The bus is in Raleigh, NC, and you can call Sean at 919-834-2800 for details.

1964 standard bus, with westy interior
full restoration about 4 years ago, including nicely welded new metal.
No rust, paint is in good shape (red/white)
Solid mechanical shape (i.e. lotsa new parts)
Interior was covered in 2-tone custom carpet. It looks cheesy, but was at least
done well.
He is asking about $3600, but I think that's negotiable. I have seen the bus,
and it does look really nice, if someone is looking for one...
Anyway, thanks
