Subject: Re: relabeled Trooper

&gt; The regular VW (Army) Jeep 'Iltis' has a removeable canvas top and 4 canvas
&gt; doors w/ plastic windows. Should be easily distinguishable from the Izuzu
&gt; Trooper. Had to drive the Iltis for a while, they are underpowered (around
&gt; 4000 pounds, &lt; 2.0l in-line 4cl gasoline engine), but fun to play with
&gt; (especially in summer with doors out and top down) .... 

Well this was a hard top with metal (looking) doors.  I really think it 
was a warped kind of guy with vanagon badges or VW had a licensing 
agreement we didn't know about.
