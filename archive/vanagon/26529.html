Subject: '80 Vanagon getting chopped.

My roommate finally finished cutting up his car in the driveway, so I get 
to move the Vanagon in and start on it this weekend.  I already mailed 
all the people that I have definate deal with about parts.  If you didn't 
get any private mail from me today, and you want/need parts you should 
write to me.

I found out it's an ASI conversion.  So if anyone wants any ASI camper 
stuff then come get it.  I'm giving all camper parts away, or throwing 
them away.  It only has an icebox (no power), but the sink and stove 
work.  Including the electric pump, and hand pump.

I had fun driving the Vanagon around during the last month, I put about
1000 miles on it.  It's much more like a car than my '66, but there's a
nice primal thing with the '66... you can feel the road.  

I really think VW should have put out a performance edition of the 
air-cooled Vanagon.  After driving Martha's and this one, I think they're 
a bit on the doggish side.  They should have made an option with beefed up 
suspension, and an engine with about 2.5-3.0 liters.
