Subject: Re: Audi 5-cylinder information needed. 

&gt;but we need more 
&gt;&gt; information, i.e. height, transmission attachment, personal experiences 
&gt;&gt; (are they good? we hear 300k miles is no problem).  
&gt;
&gt;Yes.  300k miles before rebuild is a number I heard from my mechanic.  
&gt;They are a bit heavy, I think.  I love the smooth power and low-down 
&gt;torque of my VW Quantum Syncro.  It revs to the 6K limiter like it wants 
&gt;to keep going.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; VW in south africa 
&gt;&gt; supposedly made vanagons with audi 5 cyln in them, any specs? does anyone 
&gt;&gt; have VWSA's number?
&gt;
&gt;They will probably just tell you not to do it.
&gt;
&gt;Start by joining the Audi list.  There are lots of folks there that have 
&gt;done all kinds of things with the 5-banger.

&gt;Quattro List Info Message - May 15, 1995 
&gt;
&gt;*** SAVE THIS MESSAGE AND READ IT TWICE *** 
&gt;
&gt;quattro is a list for Audi *enthusiasts*. You need not own an Audi to 
&gt;join the list, nor must you own specifically own a quattro model, though 
&gt;many list members do. Anything and everything about Audis can be 
&gt;discussed, from problems to features, where to get parts and so forth. 
&gt;
&gt;This list is served by majordomo, an automated mailing list manager. All 
&gt;subscribe/unsubscribe requests are processed automatically. Majordomo 
&gt;commands ARE SENT TO MAJORDOMO, not to the list. Please remember this!
&gt;
&gt;This list is unmoderated. That means that anything you send to the list 
&gt;can and will be delivered to all list members without any approval or 
&gt;editing. Note that since this is a discussion list, the Reply-to line is 
&gt;set to the list. Replying to a message will cause your reply to be sent 
&gt;to the whole list. If you want to send a personal note to the person who 
&gt;sent the message, you need to specify that in your To: line. Some mailers 
&gt;do this automatically, some don't. In some extreme cases you will need to 
&gt;cut-n-paste the originator's address from the message headers or his 
&gt;signature line.
&gt;
&gt;*** Subscribing:
&gt;
&gt;To subscribe to the quattro list, send email containing the line 
&gt;
&gt;subscribe quattro
&gt;
&gt;in the BODY of the message to majordomo_at_coimbra.ans_dot_net. 
&gt;
&gt;*** Submissions:
&gt;
&gt;Once you have been subscribed, you can send messages to the list by 
&gt;mailing to quattro_at_coimbra.ans_dot_net.
&gt;
&gt;Should you have a problem requiring human intervention, send mail to 
&gt;quattro-owner_at_coimbra.ans_dot_net.
&gt;
&gt;*** Digest:
&gt;
&gt;The quattro list is a moderate volume list. AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy 
&gt;users please note - your mailbox may overfill. This happens quite a bit. 
&gt;If it does happen often, you will be dropped from the list. If you are 
&gt;paying per message received, you will do better with the digest instead. 
&gt;
&gt;The digest version of the list contains all the messages sent to the 
&gt;list, grouped into large chunks so you get less mail messages (albeit 
&gt;larger messages). If you want to be on the digest version, simply 
&gt;subscribe to quattro-digest using the method outlined above. If you are 
&gt;on the normal quattro list and want to change to the digest version, you 
&gt;must unsubscribe from quattro and subscribe to quattro-digest using the 
&gt;normal procedure. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Bounces:
&gt;
&gt;NOTE: bounces will not be tolerated. If I notice a bounce continuing over 
&gt;a 
&gt;period of more than 2 days or so, I will attempt to notify your admin of 
&gt;the problem but most likely you will be dropped from the list. You can 
&gt;always resubscribe once the problem has cleared up. 
&gt;
&gt;Archives:
&gt;
&gt;Before you start sending questions to the list, you should look at the 
&gt;archives. There are various files on topics such as parts_vendors and 
&gt;mechanics (the subject of these should be obvious). If you have any good 
&gt;additions to these files, let me know. Also, the list itself is archived 
&gt;in monthly chunks called quattro.9410, quattro.9411, etc. All these files 
&gt;are stored on coimbra.ans_dot_net and can be retrieved using 3 different methods:
&gt;
&gt;- email: send mail to majordomo_at_coimbra.ans_dot_net, in the body say: 
&gt;
&gt;index quattro
&gt;
&gt;You can then use the get command to retrive files. 
&gt;
&gt;- http://coimbra.ans_dot_net/quattro.html
&gt;
&gt;ftp will NOT work, nor will telnet, so don't bother trying. 
&gt;
&gt;Enjoy the list!
