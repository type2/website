Subject: Turn signal switch.

Me again.

I was also failed on my inspection becasue my high-beams do not work.
I disasembled the turn signal switch unit on th '71 Bus and found that
three of the wires in there has become disconnected.

Two of the wires are for the high beam switch, and the third 
connects to the little PC board in there. I dont know if 
I can solder it back on, as there is so little room to work
the soldering iron. I dont want to burn the insulation off the
other wires, and I can take the unit out, as the
wires go into a loom, and through some small holes.

Any suggestions? Should I rewire the high beam switch to 
another switch, on the dashboard, and tear off the bridge that
coveres up the other wires that are coming off?
