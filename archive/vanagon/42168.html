Subject: Re: '90 Weekender - What's it worth

Hi Bo,

&gt;I didn't even mention the pop top.  I does have one.  I didn't even think
ofthat.  It is a 90 &gt;or 91.  It has the silver/grey bumpers and side molding.
&gt;No sink/stove/refrig.  Has a 3 person back seat that reclines into a bead
&gt;and two rear facing seats.  Has a table or two as well.


It looks like you found a Multivan (if it has the rear clothes locker,
curtains, and window and rear hatch screens).  A pretty rare beast, as I
recall, and one I wouldn't mind finding for myself &lt;g&gt;.  Looking at Auto
Trader for the last month or two I don't see a Multivan for sale, but I would
guess the price should be somewhere between a Carat and a Westfalia.  '90-'91
Carats seem to go for between $8 and 11K, and Westfalias of the same vintage
are about $14K.  Given the high mileage and the condition of the poptop, I'd
guess that $10-11K would be a fair price.

Good luck,
Ryan
