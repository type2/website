Subject: California Syncro Off-Road Trip at Red Rock Canyon

Syncronauts,

I'm planning on doing a Syncro off-road trip as an adjunct to the next
California Camping trip scheduled for Red Rock Canyon the weekend of April
27th.   Red Rock Canyon State Park is located about 25 miles north of Mojave
California and is a desert campground.  The southernmost stretches of the
Sierra Nevada mountains are just a short trip away.  

I don't know exactly what the California Camping Crazies are planning, but
I'll be bringing the kids (8 &amp; 5 yrs old) and planning a family style weekend
of fun and Syncro outing or two.  

I have a couple of friends that may go and bring their Jeeps.  I know the
Jeeps don't fit in too well with typical VW buses, but they'll mesh nicely
with the Syncros on the trail.

Let me know if you're interested.  

I know that some of you are on the Vanagon mailing list and will be getting 2
copies of theis message.  My appologies.
