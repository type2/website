Gary,

You inquired about info. on Transporters in Canada.  A friend had one some
time ago and I understand it refers to the cargo version Vanagon. Still
quite a few around here and I see alot of new &quot;eurovan&quot; versions on the
road.  Good choice of vehicle for those in the delivery/courier business.
My buddy loved his!!
