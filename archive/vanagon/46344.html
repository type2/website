Subject: Re: Firearms and Inuvik?


Ummm... why would anyone feel the need for a gun in Canada?  It's not like 
anybody's going to shoot you or anything.

If you want to bring a rifle into the country for hunting, there 
shouldn't be any problems as long as you register it at the border and 
follow the strict guidelines for transportation of firearms.  I can't see 
hunting on the inuvik trip, though, since we'll be moving nearly every 
day (not any time to clean or cure), and hunting permits are expensive 
for non-Canadians anyway.

Fishing is a cheap and quiet way to obtain your food, if that's your 
thing.  We're even bringing a barbeque.
