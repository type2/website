##Pickups continued to have exposed underframes and some Westy's have the

Speaking of heater tubes...I looked at mine this weekend.  Small rust 
holes, darn.  

1)	How do I replace it--a competent local welder?
2)	What about the &quot;insulating&quot; sleeve and the tube to the rear heater?
3)	Is there a kit?

Thanks!
