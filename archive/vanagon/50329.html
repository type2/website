Subject: Vanagon CV noises?

In early June, I had some work done at the local dealer in order to &quot;get it
right the first time.&quot; I wished to avoid multiple day delays that I had
experienced at other mechanics that I have used in the past. &quot;Well man, I'll
get to it and call ya when I (get off my dead *** and) get it done.&quot; (days
and days later the vehicle still sat idle...)

*The Problem:
The work in question was prompted by the tell-tale knocking of the right
rear CVs. I had no experience in doing CVs and needed the daily driver on
the road. The local VW dealer showed me shiny wear on the CVs and said that
the wheel bearing also needed done. OK fine. Grrr... It cost an arm and a
leg which I didnt have. (Mondo $$$$~shoulda, coulda, woulda...) Magic
plastic to the rescue. =(
About the first week of August I took it back and complained of a squeaky
noise with a frequency (of occurence) which matched the speed of the
vehicle. reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet... The
guys checked it out and test drove it on and off the lot and basically
topped off the tranny lube and shrugged their shoulders. &quot;Gee, Mr.VanBondo&quot;,
they said in all of their profesionally polished politeness &quot;we couldn't
really locate the noise. The tranny lube was down a tad and humma humma
humma. Drive some more and see how it goes.&quot; $40.00 for tranny lube, labor
and &quot;shop supplies&quot; Grrr... I couldn't afford to keep the car off the road
or to be bent over like a punk date.
reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet... I called the
dealer back again yesterday and asked about bringing it back and approaching
it as a &quot;come-back.&quot; &quot;Well Mr. Mr.VanBondo&quot;, they said in all of their
profesionally polished politeness, &quot;We certainally take consideration for
parts warrantees...&quot; When I pressed the point re: control of the expenses I
was told that I had control over that. Interpreted to read as &quot;If ya wannit
fixed afta we gets it torn down on the rack weez gonna hose ya again...&quot;

*Bottom line Question:
Does anyone have any technical insight as to what mechanically could be
malconfloogilated? Me thinks it's high time that old Rusty breaks out the
crescent wrenches ;-) and gets the thing fixed right once and for all...
Could it be something in the brake drum rather than CV related?
reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet-reet...
