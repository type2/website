&gt;My tires are nearing the end of their life.  We usually get tons of rain

possible.

&gt;Last night in the rain, doing about 45 mph on a back road, I could just hit 
&gt;the gas and the tires would start to spin.  Not what I call a secure
footing.

I believe the eurovan uses 205/65-15's.  I do not think this size is
available in Aquatread. Ive seen aquatreads used on Vanagons and those people
are very pleased except for the slight noise they make.  Especially on
concrete pavement.  They seem to last about 50K.  I would look for a high
performance tire in a 215 or 225/60-15.
