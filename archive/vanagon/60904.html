Subject: Re: What weight motor oil?

&gt;I don't want to start another week long discussion on motor oil.
&gt;But what weight oil should I put in my 84 Westy.  I have been told
&gt;several things.  Right now I am leaning toward 20w-50. ??????

I would bet that the CW on the net says 20W50.  Certainly for summer in
most parts of the world this would seem to make sense.  However, I just got
my oil changed at a VW dealer.  They used 15W40 and claimed this is per VWs
recommendation.  I am not that well versed on the topic but think this may
be regional.  Vancouver is cool year round so I am not worried if someone
got it wrong.  

By the way, the oil change was free (C$7.00 for the filter).  All I had to
do was download a coupon from the net.
