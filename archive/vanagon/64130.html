Subject: Can you VR6 a Vanagon?


'will' it fit...'can' it fit...please James, MAKE it fit!! (I'll mail you
an oversize shoehorn).  If I had a VR6 sitting on the garage floor I
wouldn't be able to sleep!!! (the VanaGon's taking over my life?!).

&gt;I have &quot;aquired&quot; a VR6.  Does anyone know if it will fit in my '85?
