Well,

I didn't expect much of a response, but there are more diesel fans out
there than I expected.

The tools have been spoken for.  I do have another diesel-related item:
the Bentley manual for rabbit/jetta diesels.  This covers the engine
that's in the Vanagons.  This is the service manual, not the repair 
manual (like the vanagon), so there are lots of how-tos.

This little beauty comes with black oil stains, and got a bit waterlogged
in its past, but all the pages are still readable, and considering the
price, a good deal.

Again, as a special deal to the readers of this list, it goes for the 
low-low price of $5 or so.

-Jim
