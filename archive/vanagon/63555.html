Subject: vanagon wheelwell extensions






derek  have read your numerous postings on the 16&quot;,  and would love to
do the same to my 91 synchro but the prices are steep!  the wheelwell
extensions in particular must be available from some other source in
europe....i contacted a manufacturer in taiwan who expressed interest
but needed a sample to copy....any further ideas?  same with a
brushguard,  as the cost of shipping the msds unit is absurd. 
however,  if he made the guard in two pieces, it could probably be
shipped via ups ( post strike, that is ).  let me know what you think

cheers 
jim catterson
