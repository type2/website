Subject: Re:  Fuel Gauge inaccuracy


	Additional information, normal operating temp according to the 
	coolant temperature gauge is above the warning light... since
	the voltage stabilizer serves both gauges, looks like I'll be 
	looking at it for a starting point. (my coolant temp &quot;norm&quot;
	is our '91 Carat whose gauge reads below the warning light...)
