                  Thanks for your interest in the ALL VEHICLE TENT...

1.      If you've supplied your USPS mailing address,  our standard AVTent

packet is en route.     (Please e-mail your mailing address if you haven't
already.)

2.      ***  NOW OPEN:  World Wide Web access to ARKATENTS feature
products via
HomePage Mall  --  http://www.primenet_dot_com/~jimb/arkatent/tents.html  -- 
or
e-mail any time to  74353.2767_at_compuserve_dot_com.  ***

3.      The Eureka! ALL VEHICLE TENT fits most popular minivans,  SUV's, 
and
pickups with cab-high caps/toppers  --  if you're driving anything from a
standard hatchback to a Suburban,  it will fit  (including all domestic
and
most import minivans and SUV's  --  contact ARKATENTS via e-mail if in
doubt).
        We use it with our Plymouth Voyager minivan,  for family camping
trips and
outdoor trade shows.  It is big but light in weight,  sturdy,  waterproof
(with roof rainfly attached),  easy to use and maintain,  and versatile 
--
great for all outdoor events,  including track/running meets,  astronomy
gatherings,  beach camping,  emergency and expedition base station,  you
name
it.
        The AVTent  (blue &amp; gray in color)  includes an integral
porch-style awning,
waterproof floor,  roof fly,  and walls,  huge doors and screened windows
(versus smaller designs of a few cheaper knock-off models),  and all poles
(heavy gauge shock-corded aluminum,  versus cheaper &quot;composites&quot; found in
recent knock-off models) and hardware,  plus ample stuff sacks for stowage
and carrying,  and Eureka!'s lifetime limited warranty against defects in
materials or workmanship  (pre-purchase warranty copy on request).  It
sleeps
4-5  (9' x 9' floor),  with 7' center height for stand-up headroom.
        The unique hatchway connection to the main vehicle means added
protection
from the elements,  increased privacy,  and increased use of the &quot;host&quot;
vehicle  --  you can pitch the tent,  drive around,  and re-connect later,
for base camp-style outings any time you camp!
        
4.      If you're ready to order  ($395.00 US,  free UPS delivery in
continental
US,  street addresses only;  other locations add 40%,  subject to freight
restrictions) our 1-800 order line for Visa and MasterCard users is
