Subject: Re: Parts Place

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi again.  I'm still trying to put my '81 into factory condition.  I have
&gt; &gt; some stuff coming from the Parts Place.  Are they usually reliable?
&gt; 

Unlike some on this list I have always been perfectly happy with them 
over 10 years of use.   Have saved me a lot of money over the years, 
they are not always the best price (but always a good start, never 
pay more than them) and I have had more than my share of returns to 
them but like everything else mail order use a credit card, be very 
plain but descriptive when ordering parts, and if forced to return 
speak forcefully but peaceably and you will never have a problem from 
them.  They do some neat tool rentals (FWD wheel bearing puller) that 
no one else does.
