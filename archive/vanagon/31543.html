Subject: Re: FAQ Needs Critiquing

&gt;Inversely, for cold weather the above should still be true as well
&gt;as the flaps in the fan housing that allow air to blow on to the
&gt;engine should be in working order and the thermostat hooked up so
&gt;that it can close the flaps in cold weather and thus, keep the engine

Doesn't the thermostat OPEN the flaps as the engine temperature rises? 
Unless I'm still confused about this, I believe the spring holds the 
cooling vanes (&quot;flaps&quot;) closed and the thermostat pushes them open as the 
temp rises.

Would someone with more experience please validate or refute this?

&gt;at optimum operating temperature.  Otherwise, a cold running engine
&gt;will wear out in a much shorter than expected time.
