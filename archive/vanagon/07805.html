&gt; A while back their was a thread regarding &quot;interchangability&quot; of vanagon
&gt; driver and passenger seats with other car seats, ie. Audi 4000?
&gt; Any more info? Anybody installed non-stock seats?

I just got done doing it, and I don't think there are very many seats
that will bolt right in.  I had to mount boards to the floor (which is
not actually the floor but the raised platform that the seats sit on)
and bolt the seats to the boards.  It wasn't really all that hard, just
time consuming.  Oh, and the seats are higher than the VW ones, which were
very flat.  I think this is typical of &quot;other&quot; seats.
