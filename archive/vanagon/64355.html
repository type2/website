You have the &quot;Weekender&quot; (or for 86/87 the non-GL camper) that originally had
a removable AC/Battery fridge just behind the passenger seat. Should be two
bolt holes in the floor either side where it latched down. The battery under
the driver's seat goes to the &quot;lighter&quot; socket on the inside of the passenger
seat base (between the seats); where you were to plug in the fridge so you
could kick the plug out whenever the passenger moved about in the van.
