Just a weird thought...how about a windshield washer pump? There are millions of
them cheap in junkyards all across the globe....

&gt; &gt;   Interiors remained nearly identical through the 1973 model year. When the
&gt; &gt;   pop-top changed in 1974, it was not longer possible to vent the sink 
&gt; &gt;   throught the roof and it was moved to the left &lt;drivers&gt; side and vents
&gt; &gt;   throught the wall below the passenger window. The water system got an
&gt; &gt;   electric pump at the same time. 
&gt; &gt;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know about the chances of said electric pump fitting my 
&gt; &gt; '71?  It doesn't work at all now.  Somewhere I have the name of a 
&gt; &gt; place that sells rebuild kits for these.  If a '74 or newer pump would
&gt; &gt; fit I could salvage one and then rebuild it.  Yes?  No?  Indifferent?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that this would be easy to do.  I know what you mean
&gt; about the manual pump.  I bought a rebuild kit from a local RV supply
&gt; place, and it worked good for a while, but if it sits unused for any
&gt; length of time, then all the water drains out, and it takes a lot of
&gt; effort to get it primed again.  One solution to this (which I haven't
&gt; tried yet) is to get a small in-line check valve (again from the local
&gt; RV supply) so the water doesn't drain out.
