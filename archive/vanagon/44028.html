The awning I ordered for my '87 Wesfalia arrived and I got it installed 
yesterday. I'm really pleased, it's a high-quality product and was quite 
easy to install without drilling any holes in the van. I got the A&amp;E 
Systems Catalina 2500 in the 9' 10&quot; size. With the van adapter kit for 
rain-gutter installation, total cost came to about $400. I purchased the 
awning through Camping World via mail order. Their number is 800.626.5944. etc.

        I also have the same awning and agree with Mark's assessment of its
virtues. However I have some preventative advice in preserving the value of
said awning. I would definitely rig up some wind stabilizing devices. I have
a hold down kit that I got from Camping World that holds the support poles
in the ground and works very well. What I don't have and wish that I had
had, is another strap to hold down the awning material itself. This strap
would go over the top of the awning from side to side and also be secured in
the ground. It too is available from Camping World. When I was camping in
the Florida Keys this past spring I had the awning set up in a slight rain.
I went off to take a shower and when I came out of the washroom a full blown
gale had arrived! I ran back to the campsite where my wife was hanging on to
the awning fabric. It had begun to tear off the roller at a seam. We both
hung on to the thing for about in hour in 35 to 40mph wind and driving rain
it was too windy to roll it back up. After the storm passed I had a tear
about 2ft off the roller and I still havn't fixed it yet.
