Subject: corrections on capacitor fix air flow box (22MFD vs 10MFD?)




Scott,
The procedure you sent out is incorrect,was also incorrect form the Lars
Herrnsdorf in Sweden. The capacitor (+) could go to terminal #2 and (-) to
teriminal #4(ground). Below is the post form the file archives.Also note
the added ground wire. I bought a tantalum 22MFD 35VDC capacitor cost me
$4.50, the tantalum types cost more other types. Also the electronics store
(Forbes Dist. in B'ham Al) did not have the 12volt but said the 35V would
be OK.(?) I will research this before installation.Also wondering if the
22MFD should be used over the 10MFD,maybe some of you electrical engineer
types might comment on this.

tantalum type (cost me .41 cents). Solder the + side to wire #4 and the
negative side to #2. wrap the bare wires in electrical tape, then slide the
boot back up over everything, this seals everything in well. This
information was made available to me through the many helpful Vanagon
people on the web.

flow Sensor Modification.&gt;The addition of a capacitor to the air flow
sensor wiring may help with intermitent miss. (The mechanic at the
dealership says this will also cause stalling after being driven awhile and
will not restart for
about 30 minutes. Runs fine when restarted.) A 10uF/25
Volt capacitor can be installed.)  Remove the connector from the air flow
sensor.)  Pull back the boot on the connector for the air flow sensor.)
Remove connectors 2 and 4 from the hardshell connector for the air flow
sensor.)  Cut the connectors of the ends of the wires, strip the ends of
the wire and connect the '+' side of the capacitor
    to the #2 wire and
the '-' side of the capacitor to the #4 wire.Crimp on new power timer
connectors on the #2 and #4 wires and reinsert them back into the hardshell
connector.
5)  Reconnect the airflow sensor connector)  Connect a ground
from the metal part of the air box to the empty 6mm ground connection point
on the right cylinder head.
