&gt;&gt;                                    than a speeding EV; and longblock is 
$650
&gt;
&gt;Isn't this the small Chevy V6?  I got one in my S10.  The EV is more
&gt;powerful with its inline 5.  Seriously.
&gt;
&gt;Okay the Chevy V6 is more plentiful and I'm sure cheaper than the VE 5.

Seriously, this feels like a great conversion to me, now that the throttle
is set up right. The Holley carb and direct exhaust may be helping the power
somewhat, tho I don't know what the engine was like before they were
installed. I believe the Vanagon may be lighter than an EV, and it has
a much shorter-geared transmission than an S10. All these add up  to
sports-car-like acceleration, though not like my old Mustang.

Gas mileage suffers (17 mpg freeway), but this thing is a blast to drive,
and is surprisingly quiet. The heater out of a Volvo, beneath the back seat, 

kept me toasty in a snowstorm at night in the mountains north of LA before
Christmas. In truth, my old '69 bus with original German heater boxes,
did the same in the mountains west of Denver, in 0 degree winters, except
going downhill.

You pays your money and you takes your choice, I guess.
