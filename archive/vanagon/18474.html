Matthew,

You're in luck!  The battery isolators used for 12v systems are much, much
simpler than those used on 6v :-)

Call J. C. Whitney (312) 431-6102.  Tell the young lady you would like a
battery isolator; that you don't have the catalog but you wrote down the
number: 12VT9422T, twenny buks.  (page 96 of catalog #572R, order code
NLFA1).  Pay an extra two bucks, they'll get it to you the next day.  (The
isolator comes with instructions.)

A battery isolator is nothing more than an industrial-grade diode that will
allow you to charge two (or more) batts from one alternator but will prevent
the batts from discharging into each other.  And the standard automotive
variety works just fine on 6, 12 or 24 volt batteries.

Whitney offers a large number of isolators and kits of parts.  But you can do
just as well using locally procured materials.  #10 wire will handle the
charging current to your auxiliary battery.  Be sure all fittings are
soldered as well as crimped and make sure both battery and wiring are well
secured; if it can shake, it will break.  

-Bob
