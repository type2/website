&gt;      Bob,
&gt; 
&gt;        This sounds a lot like Vanagon Syndrome (yes--so many Vanagons have
&gt;      this problem that there is a special name for it).  I have not had
&gt;      personal experience with this so take anything I have to say about it
&gt;      with a grain of salt.  There was some discussion of this about a month
&gt;      ago because another list member had this problem.  There is a
&gt;      technical bulletin the describes the fix.  Essentially you install a
&gt;      wiring harness that VW has since developed to fix the problem.  I
&gt;      think it goes on the Air Flow Sensor.  Other list members should be
&gt;      able to tell better if your exact symptoms are the same.  If you need
&gt;      any more detail search under the name Vanagon Syndrome in the
&gt;      archives.
&gt; 

Before you spend that 100+ on the harness, I don't think that will help
in this situation.  The problem that the harness fixes isn't so
debilitating.

As someone who has experienced the 'replace everything-and it didn't
help', no there are no easy answers.  Things to look for considering how
you describe your problem:  1) bad wire somewhere, 2) vacuum leak, 3)
bad ground.

Has the dealer been doing all these great deeds for free or gouging
you?  If it's been free, let him check the above 1,2,&amp;3.  If he's been
gouging you, it's very simple (and free) to check yourself.

Seriously, the way you've described your problem, one of these 3 things
should be it.  i.e. when it's down you have to fiddle in the engine
compartment to make it work--doesn't really matter what you fiddle with
as long as you fiddle; then it magically works until the next time it
breaks, then fiddle and repeat cycle.  This sounds like a connection
issue, not a component (albeit an electrical or vacuum connection).

Good luck,
Tonya
