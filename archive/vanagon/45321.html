Subject: next CCC's camping change/update


Earlier I sent out e-mail to all of you proposing that the next CCC's trip
be the last weekend in July.  This turned out to be not good for many of
you, and additionally, this weekend is the the weekend that our vanagon/bus
list admin, Gerry Skerbitz and his family will be in the bay area visiting.
As a number of us wish to get together and finally meet Gerry, I propose
that we put the next campout on the following weekend, which is the first
weekend in August.  Stay tuned on that one; we have been doing some pre-
site scouting for potential good camping spots for the group.  All suggestions
welcome, as well, of course.

So this e-mail is also to invite all of you interested to get together
and meet Gerry.  Plans are still a little vague, but it looks like we'll
have a gathering either that Saturday evening and/or Sunday brunch, these
days being on the last weekend in July.  I'm happy to have something
here, as they will probably spend Sat. nite here anyway (and anyone else
who wants to is welcome as well, of course).  Or/also, we may arrange
an event in Sacramento, where they'll be headed upon departing the Bay
Area.  We'll keep you posted...

 Current lust list: a TDI Passat wagon, DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     on to the outside of your shoes, and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.  Thanks!  /m
