Subject: Thom's bus pics available on the web
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 1995 18:27:03 -0800 (PST)

Hi again folx,
	Thom Fitzpatrick sent me seven nice pictures of his bus, which I
scanned in and are now available on the net.  They can be downloaded via
anon FTP or gopher at &quot;bolo.nosc_dot_mil&quot; in the directory &quot;/ftp/tiff/vw/fitz&quot;
or viewed on my VW web page at &quot;http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw&quot;.  
I plan on posting pictures of the pizza gathering, the pfeiffer trip, and
the GNATT tour when they become available, and if anyone else would like
to send me pictures of their VW's I would be happy to scan those and make
them available as well, time permitting.  Enjoy!

-David
