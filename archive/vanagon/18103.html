&gt; On May 22, Bill Abbot asked:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone in this group had a rubber or braided stainless
&gt; &gt;brake hose or oil line fail? The early type IV FI engines had a LOT
&gt; &gt;of engine fires because of fuel line problems, anyone here have one?
&gt; 
Well, I've seen a couple of Type 4 dual carbed Buses which had severe
engine fires but never a f.i. engine.  However, I too was a great
procrastinator on replacing them in my old '76 as I didn't want to
have to pull all those injectors and cut off the factory crimped on
fuel hoses.  One out of the four was seeping gas slowy when I sold it
early this year, a testament to the OEM German cloth covered hose, the
hoses to and from the fuel main ring had been replaced twice in the
things life, as they were exposed to the elements under the bus, and I
must say I have never taken the requisite gas shower, simply clamp off
your lines with fuel line clamps then drain the tank before changing the
ones to the tank.  I told the new owner to have em changed and gave her
a discount for their condition and she had it done when the guy replaced
the fuel gauge sender and since he was doing that work as well didn't
soak her on the labor too bad.
