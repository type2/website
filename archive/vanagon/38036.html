&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Haven't called on it but $300?!?!?!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Called the Star Tribune.  Two errors in the ad.  One was the phone 
&gt;number.  The other was the price.  He wants $3000.00.
&gt;Knew it was too good to be true!
&gt;Correct # is 782-9939, if anyone is still interested.
&gt;

All,

I tried to post the correct phone number and price yesterday.  I don't know
if it processed or not as I haven't received much mail from the list since
(&lt;25 postings).
