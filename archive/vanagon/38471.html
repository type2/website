Subject: '90 Rear Heater Leak Fixed :)

Hi Everyone.  We took the van into the shop today to get the rear 
heater looked at.  It definitely was leaking from the control valve 
(between the metal bracket and plastic).  However, it didn't leak 
when I drove it there this morning!  So, as one not to gamble, I 
figured change it anyway.... like I really want 17.5 litres of 
coolant *inside* my van when she blows!!  I also had the vent plug 
changed as mine was the original plastic one.

So, a quick run down..

control valve   $116.59
gasket              $   6.22
bolt                  $  5.26
seal                  $  1.89
-15%             -$125.93  (they give me 15% parts/labour)

All prices are in CDN $$$

Here's the good stuff... they didn't charge me labour! :)  They felt 
sorry for me as I had just had the cooling system pressure tested and 
flushed 2 weeks ago.  It was 0.8 hours labour (_at_ $78/hr CDN) to do 
the work.

So, I have the old parts, and I'm going to see if I can rebuild that 
valve one day.  If I can seperate the metal plate from the plastic 
body, there's gotta be an 0-ring in there to change!

Now, back to &quot;spring&quot; cleaning the van...

Harry.
