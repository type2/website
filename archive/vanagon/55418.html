Subject: Driving from FL to CO, any tips?

I will be driving my 89 Westy(non syncro) from Florida to Colorado and
back for vacation.  I have very little experience driving in snow and no
experience driving a vanagon or Westy in  the snow.  Will this only be a
problem in the mountains?  Any tips or great camping suggestions? 
Thanks a lot for any help. I have never been there:(
