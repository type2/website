Oops--- Warning! Warning! Brain fart in progress!
Pay no attention to that vanagon behind the curtain, etc. etc.

After posting my thermocouple expertise for all to see, I actually
looked it up and found out I was flat wrong, while David Schwarze was
right.

A thermocouple is a pair of dissimilar metals bonded together,
which produce a voltage when heated, all by themselves. Such a device
may indeed be inside the CHT gauge, and would need no external power
to operate if correctly designed.

The gadget I described (a resistor which varied its resistance with
temperature), is a &quot;thermistor&quot;, and must be powered externally
to run a gauge. This is what's in the water-temp sensor of the
V6anagon.
