Subject: 1986 Vanagon for sale (amended)

Hi.
In preparation for *emigrating* to Australia, my parents are putting their
1986 Vanagon up for sale.  It is a *4 speed stick-shift* &amp; is in excellent
condition.  I had both cylinder heads re-manufactured by RimCo last
December, and there are no problems at all with the Vanagon now.  It has
also had a full set of new hydraulic lifters installed, and the oil &amp;
filter has always been fastidiously changed.  I changed the AC compressor &amp;
receiver/dryer about 10 months ago and had the system recharged with freon.
 Coolant has been changed annually.  The Vanagon is Silver and has blue
upholstery - both in excellent condition (no dents or rust at all).  We are
asking $4800, but this is negotiable.  Located in Riverside, California.
Please reply directly via e-mail if you are interested in purchasing the
Vanagon.
Regards
MIKE
