&gt; I think we need a kind of Old Bus Recovery Squad, a group of us foolish

&gt; evaluating the mechanical condition of old buses, providing our skill and
&gt; expertese extracting said from bogs for the purpose of trailering, towing or
&gt; driving (shrill laughter) the wreck to where ever the new owner wishes to
&gt; commit mechanical seppuku.

I could help with breadloaves in Southern California.  I just installed
a 3500lb hitch on my bus, too, so I'm ready to tow!  Well, almost ready.
I have to install the engine first.
