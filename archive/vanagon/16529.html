V&gt; Were you perhaps not level?  Those propane fridges are very sensitive to
 &gt; that.  Even a couple of degrees of slope and they won't cool well.

That very well may be it, though if I wasn't level, it 'twernt by much.
I thought that you could also run the fridge off of DC, while the car
was going. But if it needs to be level all the time, it would never cool.
