Subject: Re: Copy of: Re: Looking for 4WD Diesel VW van

&gt;| &gt; Road and Track did an article on the 16&quot; diesel syncro - it's in the
&gt;| &gt;  archives. 
&gt;| 
&gt;| I've just searched the archives at:
&gt;| http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html
&gt;| and was not able to come up with this article.  Can you send me a copy or
&gt;| help to pinpoint the article by letting me know the year of the archives it
&gt;| should be in?

	Oops, you're right, the link is off of Tom Forhan's nice Westy Syncro
page... Look in the table for the Road Test of the 16&quot; Diesel Syncro... The
Syncro Westy page can be found at:

http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm

Anyway, I followed the URL for the article into the archives and did a search
for diesel and found that this was an article translated from a German car
magazine (which is said in the post eariler, oops again). So I was wrong, the
review was not by Road and Track, those are in the file archives...

Sorry to disappoint with false hope... The article if anyone is still
interested can be found at:
