&gt;Ok,
&gt;
&gt;y'all with dualport 1600cc ingins in your bus can respond to this one.  

Well, I have a single port 1500 in my '59 pickup. I think the vintage is
around '65.

&gt;What is your top freeway speed(on flat ground), and how often do you go 
&gt;through ingins?

Well, the speedo's a bit suspect, as I'm running 15&quot; wheels, and the
speedo's from a '67 which I think had 14&quot;, but I can go 60-65, and have
gone even faster. I don't like going that fast, though, because I get tired
of steering and I still have '59 brakes.

&gt;I'm interested because I've had my bus for almost a year, and I really 
&gt;baby it.  It drives no more than 55, yet I've seen similar buses(same 
&gt;year range 68-70) scootin by me, and I always think &quot;Boy, they must not 
&gt;like their motors&quot;.

I've had the vehicle for a year now, and haven't had any problems with the
ingin yet... (knock on rust!)

&gt;So what's the scoop, am I a Wolkswagen Weenie, or are these people just 
&gt;askin to blow up thier engine(oops! ingin)?

A volkshead (bubble head) friend of mine has this saying: There are two
kinds of Bus owners. Those who have blown their engines, and those who
will.
