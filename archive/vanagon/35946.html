&gt;Hey all,
&gt;So, all you folks out there who have buses with Type IV engines, what
&gt;do you use to get the oil filter off??  It's a little cramped under there so
&gt;it
&gt;doesn't look like I'd be able to get one of those standard oil filter
&gt;wrenches up there.  I have a wrench from Toyota that attaches to a
&gt;ratchet and slips over the bottom of the filter, but it's too small in
&gt;diameter
&gt;to fit the VW filter.  Is there a special filter removal tool that you have
&gt;to
&gt;buy or can it be done another way?

Same style socket is available for the VW tye 4 filter.  By filter at FLAPS
and get wrench to fit while there.
