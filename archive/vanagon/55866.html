&gt; Well, I'v had the '81 westie for almost 2 weeks now.  There are a couple of
&gt; minor problems I could use some advice about.
&gt; 
&gt; First, when I start it, it takes several seconds (maybe 7 to 10) for the
&gt; oil light to go out and the buzzer to quit.  Then, if I let it idle too low
&gt; during the first minute of so it is on, the light will flash again.  It
&gt; seems to happen more when I am going out my driveway, which is down through
&gt; a ditch.
&gt; 

Is your driveway angled somewhat steeply?  The oil buzzer shouldn't buzz
to begin with when you start it up (at least not on 87's).  The lights
are suppose to come on to let you know that the LEDs work.  If the oil
light stays on with buzzer, it may just mean that while parked (assuming
the van is angled quite a bit) the oil has drained away from the sensor
and it just takes a few minutes to get pumped up through the system.  If
this is the only time it does it, I wouldn't worry.
