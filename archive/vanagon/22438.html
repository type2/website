Hello,
My topic for yesterday was toys, today it's power.
Does anyone out there know of a good method of increasing the power output 
of
the Vanagon Wasserboxer engines.  I'm looking for something smog legal in
California, like intake or exhaust parts, computer chip, or most other 
things
short of an engine swap.  I already use synthetic engine oil and it seems
that K&amp;N does not make an air filter for the Vanagon.

Since I mentioned exhaust parts, it seems to me that the Wasserboxer exhaust
system is particularly tortuous with all that tubing &amp; bends and all.  I
think an ideal setup would be a dual exhaust system with a small cat. and
muffler on each side.  What do ya think?

Is the answer to my question spelled p-i-p-e  d-r-e-a-m?

Hoping it's not,
Jim Davis
