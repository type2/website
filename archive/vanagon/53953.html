&gt; Now, I am just about out of ideas on how to get my daughter's '91GL to
&gt; start whe &quot;cold&quot;, below 30F.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that the engine cranks reasonably well but gives no sign of
&gt; wanting to run. Now and then it will puff but not sound like it wants to
&gt; run.
(snip)&gt; 
&gt; If the outside temperature gets above 40F then it will start instantly.
&gt; Below 30F it refuses to start.
(snip)&gt; 
&gt; Checked that the fuel pump is running and pumping by partially filling a
&gt; milk jug from the T connection on the top of the engine.
   Check the fuel pressure. At cold start up and full throttle the pressure
   needs to be corrcect. The pressure maybe low because of the vacuume
   operated regulator nexted to the distributor.  

&gt; 
&gt; Checked continuity for the O2 and coolant temp sensors
&gt; 
  Check the resistance at the computer, when cold. 

&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible that there is something in the ECU that controls starts that
&gt; has failed but would not affect the running once started? If it is possibly
&gt; the ECU, where is the little bugger and can it be swapped easily between my
&gt; van and hers?
    COmputer are very expensive, but this is a very unusual problem
    and it is the first time I think it may be the problem, if the
    above checks out.
