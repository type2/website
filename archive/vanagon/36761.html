All the gudgeon pins I've had any experience with tended toward tight--I
assume this is normally the case. When installing the pistons, Muir says to
bang the pins in. He's nice about it, he says to put something behind the
piston to soak up the shock, but basically you whang the mothers in there
with a hammer. That's the way I handled the last short block I did.

But I didn't like it. I know bearing material (in the rods, in this case)
is deliberately soft, and I can't see how it can withstand being levered on
with a force like that without ending up beveled. I don't care whether
you're just tapping, if it's enough force to push that pin through it's got
to be orders of magnitude *more* force compressing the edge of the rod
bearing.

Has anybody pressed the pins in with a huge C-clamp or something? Am I
being too prissy here?

I like that term &quot;gudgeon pin&quot;-  very odd

I just tap them in.  It ought to be tight.  It's easier if you warm up the
cylinder with a propane torch first, and oil the pin.  I dont tap directly on
the pin, i use this angled widgit on a 3/8 extension.  I also like to pad the
back of the cylinder with rags.   I dont know how much difference it makes,
but being a Virgo, i like to  pay attention to details.   I feel like it
could hurt the piston, being hit against the head studs.  (note excessive
amount of masculine terminolgy in engines- i'm feeling very macho now)
