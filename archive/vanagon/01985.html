&gt; &gt;Maximum speed on flat ground? 95mph on I-10 East in Calif.
&gt; &gt;It's International Orange; the same color they paint utility vehicles
&gt; &gt;and garbage dumpsters.
&gt; 
&gt; well ... i always heard that Ugly was faster than Pretty. :)  &lt;it gets to
&gt; ya quicker, don't you see!&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; seriously, FLAT ground? as in, no hills, bumps, hollows, etc.? i think
&gt; you had a CHP car pushing you, bub. trying to get you OUT of california
&gt; as quick as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; on a more congenial note, that is actually NOT a bad color to have a car
&gt; painted. one, you can ALWAYS find it in the mall parking lot. two, very
&gt; few people will park next to you. three, other cars can see you very well
&gt; on the highway, in all sorts of weather.
&gt; 
&gt; my sister had a volvo station wagon in that color (factory paint, no less!)
&gt; and, while not being the most attractive shade, it was very practical and
&gt; useful. i would recommend one small change/addition: paint the roof white.
&gt; this seems to make it even more noticeable (while reducing the heat intake
&gt; of the bus).

Orange is a BEAUUUTIFUL color for a bus!  Especially Orange and White!  
*hmmph!* UGLY indeed! 

(There there, Bobo, it's alright, you're not ugly like all those mean people
say... (even if you look a bit, well, stupid...))
