Subject: Re: Help With Instrument Lighting Please

     I have the same problem with my 1983 air-cooled van.  The instrument 
     lights went out one day as I was adjusting the dimmer (rheostat).  I'm 
     assuming that I may have an open circuit here.  I have not yet checked 
     the dimmer since I'm not sure how to yank it off the dash.  Fuses and 
     bulbs are fine.

     Hi All,
     
     My digital clock between the speedometer and odometer is no longer 
     backlit when I have my headlights on. Does anyone has any experience 
     fixing this?
     
     In addition, the station preset lights on my VW Design am/fm/cassette 
     radio also no longer light up when the headlights are on. I originally 
     thought the LED's were bad, but another VW Design radio did the same 
     thing.
     
     Are these two situations related? Any help would be appreciated.
     
     TIA,
