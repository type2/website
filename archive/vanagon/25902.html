Subject: Re: heating ideas (insulating curtain)

An easy way to stay warm(er) on a long drive is to put up a curtain 
behind the front seats and direct all the heat forward.

I attach an old sleeping bag to the ceiling lip below the pop-top. This
way, I have a much smaller space to heat and all my air leaks from the
pop-top and louvered windows don't affect me... 

Note: any passengers in the back need to be in sleeping bags because it 
can get bitterly cold back there! Of course, you need to be good with the 
side-view mirrors too....
