Subject: Three Chairs for Gerry!!!

or is it 'three cheers'?  mebbe after all that beer that's been sent to
him, three chairs is more appropriate &lt;g&gt;

anyway, a resounding thank you to Gerry for his work thru the years.  my
knowledge of these wily vehicles has been increased immeasureably from this
list.  vanagon_at_lenti has enabled me to keep a vehicle i might otherwise be
tempted to trade for something economical, reliable, and inexpensive to
repair...... uhh, and despite all that i still feel a great gratitude for
Gerry's efforts :-)

he has selflessly kept the wheels turning of the listserv, joined in our
successes, and disciplined our excesses.  a superb job.  yes, Gerry, you
truly are a List God.
