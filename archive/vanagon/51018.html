Subject: Propex heaters

Hi Tom,

I'm one of those fence-sitters trying to make up my mind whether to get in
on the Propex deal.  Part of what's holding me back is:  although the
Propex will allegedly fit under the back seat, will it fit into the
compartment containing the rear heater core/fan assembly?  The rear heater
assembly in my Westy is not installed (the previous owner removed it,
presumably because it was leaking).  I've been looking for a propane heater
to replace it with that could fit into the original heater's compartment,
so that I can continue to cram the rest of the space under the back seat
with the tools, oil, tire chains, and other junk I obsessively squirrel
away in there in case of emergency.

Will the Propex fit in that space?  I realize that I could dig up the
dimensions of the Propex from last week's list messages and then go measure
the compartment for myself, but as I am a rather klutzy do-it-yourselfer I
thought it best to get a second opinion before plunking down $350 or
whatever.

Please reply via email instead of (or in addition to) the list, as I
receive the list in digest mode and may not receive the next digest in time
to join the Propex party.

Thanks,

Mark Daley
