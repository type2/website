Subject: The water heater project

     Here we go again,
     
     After a long (80 miles) drive last week I decided that something
     had to be done to my '64 heating system. It's got brand-new heater
     boxes, with new pipes and it's all wonderfully sealed and it's CRAP!
     
     I relish the days when I get into my FIAT and get out at work (6 mile 
     trip) all red-faced : )
     
     So my friend (Danny, '67 bus) and I sat down to design the ultimate
     heating system. 
     
     Firstly was the design of a water filled heater box. I am going to 
     buy one bare J-tube (cost about 7 quid) this weekend. Basically it's
     a heater box exhaust tube - without the heater box shroud and fins.
     I am going to weld a water tight tube around this J-tube as below:
     
     J tube \ ___
             /               water tight tube
       out__|_____________ /
             \_|__________|___
               |__________|_ 
                             in
     
     Then (change of tense) add an inlet tube at the bottom towards the
     rear of tube and an outlet tube at the top towards the front of the
     tube. We thought that the cold water should enter the water box as 
     far away from the exhaust port (of #3) as possible to minimise exhaust
     tube cooling. Cooling the exhaust might result in large exhaust 
     pressure difference for number 3 cylinder - something to think about.
     
     Ok so then fit a water pump (electric or fan belt driven) obtained 
     from a junk yard to power the water around. Then two 15mm copper house 
     radiator pipe the water to and from the cab. In the cab fit an 
     all-in-one radiator and fan unit from a, you guess it, small Italian
     car. Seriously all small water cooled FIATS seem to have these nice
     little water heater units in the engine bay that consist of a small
     radiator and boost fan in a nice little box. Connect the copper
     pipes to the in and out tubes on the FIAT radiator and mount it
     somewhere under the dash board and err, maybe bingo you have a toastie
     bus in winter. Well I'll let you know if it works.
     
     Some other points to note are that you will need a header tank in the 
     engine bay to &quot;let off steam&quot; and don't forget that foam lagging round 
     the copper pipes. Don't worry about boiling in Summer, just drain the
     water off coz you'll not need the heater in summer.
     
     any thoughts ?
