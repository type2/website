&gt; Item Subject: Advice Rebuilding an 84  : head coating
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Todd,
&gt; 
&gt;   How much did it cost to have the water cooled used heads repaired and coated?
&gt; How long have the used heads been in use so far?  I live in the Corvallis area,
&gt; who and where is the shop in Portland you used?  Did you also rebuild/check any
&gt; of the other aspects of the used WC heads before coating?
&gt;   I was going to look into some other coatings that are used in my profession
&gt; (Machine Design), but I like the thermal insulating properties of ceramics as
&gt; well.  However, that is an entirely different thread.  Any answers you can give
&gt; to the above questions would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Vince.
&gt; 
&gt;     Hi Vince: It cost me about 100 dollars to have the coating done. I just reground the valves after having the coating done. You must give the head to the coating shop bare. The shop I used (I think it is the only one in the NW is RM engineering. He's in the book. The guy you want ot talk to is Russ. If you do this please keep in touch.  Todd
