&lt;&lt; As part of an attempted tune-up on my '78 Bus, I removed the

 On reinstalling, forgot to seat it properly.  Isn't the contact
 on the rotor supposed to line up with the notch on the edge of
 the distributor housing, when you're around top-dead center?
 Mine is now 180 degrees off.


 Am I confused on the theory here?  If not, how do I get the
 distributor properly realigned? &gt;&gt;


YIKES!!!

You only should be able to install the distributor ONE way, that is, in
alignment with the distrubutor drive gear, which it doesn't sound like you
removed. The top surface of the dist. drive gear has an eccentric groove
which, (in my experience) keeps one from reinstalling the distributor in any
orientation other than the correct orientation. If you removed the drive gear
too, check the Bently or Haynes manuals for &quot;lining up&quot; photos and
procedures. Otherwise, go back out to the van, un-bolt the distributor,
rotate it 180 degrees, and gently shove it back down the hole until it seats
with a &quot;clunk&quot;.

subpoint: WHAT bushings?

haven't typed the word &quot;distributor&quot; that many times in my life,
