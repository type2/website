Subject: Re: early vs: late cutoff

     Mitch,
     
     &gt;Just curious...is there a formal cutoff year between what is 
     &gt;considered 'early' vs. 'late'?  Often in manuals and posts I see 
     &gt;things like: 'In early models' do this, use that ,etc. with no 
     &gt;reference to the year.
     
     Well in terms of models there are early and late models within the 
     distinct models. For example: early splits (barn doors) and late 
     splits, OR early bay windows (wrap round bumpers, small rear lenses) 
     and late bay windows (square bumpers big rear lights) OR early Type 
     25's Vanagons (air cooled) or late vanagons (water cooled).
     
     OR
     
     you could say early buses in general are split screen and late buses 
     are vanagons.
     
     As far as manuals are concerned I think the first scenario is more 
     likely, because usually a manual refers to one model type ie, split, 
     bay or vanagon. So the references to early and late are to models 
     within the major model type.
