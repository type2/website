&gt; 
&gt; With so many people expressing an interest in westy tents, is there an
&gt; aftermarket version that just isn't as good as the original ones??  How about
&gt; making up a pattern from an old one and the making it yourself.  Is this even
&gt; possible??

Are we talking the ones up on the roof, or ones that somehow
attach to the sliding door side?
