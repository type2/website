Subject:       RE: Bus drivers and waving. 


&gt; Ok I have to share one of my experiences...
&gt; 
&gt; I have an 84 GL. It is painted (by my own hand ((not finished yet)) and
&gt; looks a little tattered). I was in Woodside CA. coming out of a store, when
&gt; I noticed a woman picking bugs out of her 91 Weekender's Bra. I went over
&gt; and made small talk. I said yeah I love my bus too.(I have become used to
&gt; saying bus as a means of description, because when I tell people about what
&gt; takes me on my travels, Vanagon usually gets me a blank stare.) She looked
&gt; at me like I slapped her and said, &quot;this is a vanagon, not a bus. I don't
&gt; drive a bus.&quot; Now my vanagon was parked right next to hers and my door was
&gt; open as I spoke to her. God, I was boiling, I hate when you reach out to
&gt; others to share a common interest and get snubbed like that...
&gt; 
&gt; matt
Sounds to me like her bra strap was too tight... ;)
