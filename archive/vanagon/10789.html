&gt; 1) to the right of the spedo, there is a dummy gauge, was there a factory 
&gt; option gauge for this hole?

I think you could get a clock to go there, but I have never seen one.  I
have however seen a few people mount VDO Tachs there with nice results.

&gt; 2) Just under the said gauge hole, there is a red light thingy with a &quot;B&quot; on 
&gt; it.  Anyone know what this is?

I always assumed it was &quot;battery&quot; cause it seems to work like an alternator
idiot light - i.e. comes on when I turn the key on and goes off just after I
start the engine.

&gt; 3) I found out that I have a frozen heater cable on the right side.  Any 
&gt; ideas short of replacing it?

Soak it with Chrysler Heat valve penetrant.
