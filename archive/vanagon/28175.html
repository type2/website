Subject: Tires (I know, yet again)

I'm trying to replace the tires on my Syncro with the original
MXL (reinforced). I've been using these tires for three years and 
have been happy them.

Michelin doen't make them any more and calls them an &quot;Emergency 
Release Product&quot;.

I know we've had numerous discussions on what is the &quot;best tire&quot;,
but I've had good luck with these and I'd to stay with them.

So anyone have any ideas? Based on other Vanagon driver's recent 
experience, am I SOL?

According to Tom Forhan's Range Rover post today, both he and
Derek use the BF Goodrich Radial All-Terrain size 27LT8.5-14. I remember
Harry Yates raving about some Yokohama's. (Harry,  I don't remember the
model so would you please let me know about these tires)

Since this is now my wife's daily driver, I am more interested in the
passenger tire for &quot;comfort reasons&quot;.

I don't have alloys so I don't think the Goodrich will fit. 

As always, any and all opinions and info greatly appreciated.
