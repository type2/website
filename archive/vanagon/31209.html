&gt;Peter DePaoli's mad puppeteer story reminds me of friends whose MGA broke
&gt;its throttle-linkage far from home.  They hooked up two strings for the
&gt;passenger to use: pull one to open throttle, pull the other to close.  After
&gt;a few hours they had their timing teamwork down to where they could 
&gt;doubleclutch on downshifts.

My brother &amp; I had a similar situation in a Baja Bug.  We had cut (O.K., it
was in my youth, no flames please) the 62 bug into a truck shape.  We somehow
lost the throttle return spring and replaced it with a group of rubber bands.
 The rubber bands lasted long enough to get us several miles from home.  The
solution?  I got into the bed of the &quot;truck&quot; (called the Trug, for TRuck-bUG)
and reached out over the engine and acted as a human throttle return spring!
 What a ride!  Pretty stupid though.  I wouldn't dream of doing that today!
