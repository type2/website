Subject: Gasoline difference

I used to use Shell gas since 10 years ago when my 84 vanagon was new.
I got 20 mpg/city 23-24 mpg/highway. I used Shell because Shell gave me my
very first credit card and I have used it since.  About 5 years ago I shifted
to BP beacuse there was a BP station in my neighborhood and cheaper.

I also noticed that my vanagon is getting old. The gas mpg is getting lower.
I noticed that I got only about 220-230 miles between filling up. The mpg
figure was kinda about 18-19. With more freeway driving I could get to about
20 -21 still. I thought that is not bad at all.

Suddenly, the BP station in my neighborhood was sold to Shell. I started to
buy shell again.  I thought I am paying expensive gas again. I am happy.
However, I am surprised to find that now I am getting 260 miles between 
filling gas again. Is it true that there is a difference in different brand of
gas? I never believed this before. Now I am wondering.

My commute to and from work has been slightly increased on freeway/city ratio.
Maybe this is the answer. But the difference is so obvious that I am quite
suspicious about gas qualities now.

Any vee dub owners any experience of this?

David
