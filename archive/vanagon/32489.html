Subject: Re: Which Carbs?

&gt;After trying to nurse my sick, old, tired carbs along on my '72 bus 
&gt;and not wanting to pay through the nose to get the throttle shaft 
&gt;bushings rebuilt, I decided to pay out the %&amp;# and purchase some new carbs.

I noticed a rebushing kit for the 2 barrel Solexes on my '65 Porsche,
$24.95/carb from a place called Automotion in California, they have a
1-800-#.  It was a step drill, to remove/oversize the old bushes and new
bushes to press in.  Has anyone checked into this concept?  I can measure
the Solex shafts, maybe the Porsche kit would work?? Tim Smith

Oh, BTW, sorry but I gave away my '72 1700.  The new owner says the carbs
work fine, he's stuck then on an 1800 FI motor he had brain probs with. They
are a bolt-in BTW, I've done the same thing.  Which opens up the option of
bolting the FI system from a '75 say onto your '72!!
