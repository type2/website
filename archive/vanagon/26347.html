Subject: pancake oil leaks
Date: Thu, 10 Aug 1995 18:48:04 GMT


I traveled a tad shy of 10,000 miles these past several weeks, and the
only problem I couldn't &quot;fix&quot; was a moderate leak. I added an oil cooler
in anticipation of the &quot;desert run.&quot; Filled the beast with straight 50
weight, and then headed north into cold weather.

Developed an oil leak that I THINK is where the original oil cooler
connects to the case. But oil has been puddling up on the top of the
engine, on the right side, on the flat spot of the case right next to
the rod that controls the warm-up flaps.

Any experience or suggestions on changing out an oil cooler seal? Is
this an engine-out operation. :(
