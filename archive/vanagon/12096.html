Subject: Re: Brake Problem


Thom,

I know you've probably already done this but...
Before starting to rebuild your master cylinder,  Check that your shoes
(brake shoes) are moving freely, and that the springs are in good shape.
Thoeretically this shouldn't have anything to do with brake system pressure
but...  just check.


Cheers
