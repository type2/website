&gt;I don't know if this is something that just started happening after my
&gt;recent engine replacement, or I am just noticing it now with Spring weather
&gt;and the windows being down but when I am &quot;coasting&quot; downhill (wheels driving
&gt;engine) I hear popping sounds coming from the exhaust--vauely reminsicent on
&gt;my 1975 and 1979 Rabbits.
&gt;
&gt;Any cause for concern, or is my catalytic converter finally spitting out its
&gt;contents after 150,000 miles.

Check the throttle switrcheds to make sure they are set correctly and
working.  During closed throotle with the engine being over run, (above 1300
rpm) the fuel injectors are turned off.  In fact, if you drive down a steep
enough hill long enough in the condition, you will see the engine temp drop
as the engine is pumpin air through the cylinders with no combustion.
