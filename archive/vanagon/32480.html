So David Easterwood says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	...or, Some People Just Shouldn't Own VW's
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; He called me up a couple of weeks ago because he can't get it 
&gt; started again.  I think I have done all the charity work I can do
&gt; for this kid at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; But I think of it now as she is my ex-wife and there was a reason 
&gt; for us to split up.  Now she has slept with another man and things
&gt; would never be the same between us.

Good story David..

Sorta reminds me of the kid that bought my beloved '68.  I
had rebuilt the top-end about 20K before and the engine
was at about 125K miles.  I knew the engine was living on
borrowed time and I didn't drive it hard at all and babied
it up the steep inclines.  I made that abundantly clear to this 
guy, who lived down the street from me, the condition of the
engine.  He still insisted on buying it.  A couple months after
I sold it to him, he came over and told me that the engine
blew and wanted to know what I thought.  I told him it was
probably a rod and later on, sure enough, that's what it 
was.  I whated that car sit in his driveway for 3 years and
I know my wife was watching and every time she'd just say, 
&quot;forget it&quot;.  I know she was right and eventually it 
disappeared and I haven't seen it since.  - sigh -

Oh well, too bad...
