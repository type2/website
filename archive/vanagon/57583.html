Does anyone here know of a VW camper van available for sale in the 
central Texas area?  Especially in Austin?  A friend of mine in Michigan 
wants a reasonably rust-free bus to travel around in on his honeymoon and 
thereafter.  I'm planning on buying one for him here and driving it up to 
the wedding.
