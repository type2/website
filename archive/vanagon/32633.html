Subject: Braking for Possum (it's Friday!)

Last night, was travelling home and saw an early model bus (sorry, I'm not
yet fluent with all of the model years) with the following bumper sticker:

I BRAKE FOR POSSUMS

&gt;From all of Unca Joel's postings on this thread, I wondered if the owner of
this bus is a member of this listserv, or is a common thread to which I am
not privy, having come on the scene only lately?  (this sighting was in St.
Louis, northbound on Lindbergh Blvd, Thursday night, 1/10/96).  I tooted the
horn and waved as I passed.

As I continued on my merry way, I began to ponder how Unca Joel would feel
about braking for possum, since speeding up would increase the likelihood of
a clean kill (assuming, of course, that the VW bus is the weapon of choice
for hunting such a succulent delicacy).  It would seem to me to be an ideal
weapon.  Think of it...Two tons of steel, coupled with an adequate tread
pattern, would further tenderize and flatten the flesh to allow its use in
possum rouladen, minute possum steaks, etc., etc.  The possibilities are
endless!

Whaddaya think?  ;-)
