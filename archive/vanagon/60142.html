July 4th - 6th. The International Bus Meet at BVF International. SSVC and Bulli
kartei are organising the special indoor display of rare vans, focusing on
special body types, utility vehicles and commercials. BK are bringing over
their Mobile Museum (including the 46 Plattenwagen, the 56 Ladder truck, the
school bus, a cherry picker, a hearse etc) and are coming over in force -
approx 70 vans will be trekking to join us! Bus lovers from all over are coming
- from Finland, Australia and all over Europe and SSVC will have a hospitality
marquee to bring us all together and act as meeting place! The special display
will also feature some unusual Bay windows - a six wheeler and a hydrualic
lifter included and VW Commercial will be showing the latest models off. 
The fact that it is 50 years since the inception of the VW Transporter is also
central to the celebrations.
BVF is an established family show held on a purpose built Showground with full
camping and catering faciliies. Visitors who fly in will find guest house or
hotek accommdation close by. The show has the usual VW related concours,
partsmart, trade and club stands but also has a large craft market. There is a
special childrens marquee manned by the Burk Bros (Clowns extraordinaire) and a
full entertainment programme including a live band on Saturday night. a special
attractuon is the Rundfahrt where about 200 Veedubs cruise round the beautiful
Malvern Hills.
Situated at the footills of the famous Malvern hills the local area is known
for its beauty and history - nearby Worcester Cathedral and thr medieval market
town of Evesham are very close whilst startford and Shakespeare country are 30
minutes away. Historic Malvern is easily reached by rail or road and is only
125 miles west of London.
You are all warmly welcomed to the Bus Meet of The Millennium hosted by an
established organisation - British Volkswagen festival is one of the few shows
left that appeals and caters for VW lovers of evry generation!
