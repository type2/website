Subject: TDI:Bolt this onto your van!


Here's the TDI stats, for all diesel-freaks (&amp; the merely curious).  From 
&quot;Volkswagen Audi CAR&quot; a British mag.  The article is on the Golf GL TDI, 
with the following:
(edited for brevity)

Type			Direct-injected, intercooled turbo diesel
Displacement		1896cc
Bore/Stroke		79.5x95.5mm
Output:			90bhp(66kW)_at_4000rpm
Max. Torque:		149lb-ft(202Nm)_at_1900rpm

MPG			55mpg.(5.1L/100km)
Max Mpg.		75mpg(!?)(3.8L/100km)

Max. Speed:		110mph
0-50			7.5 sec
0-60                    10.2 sec


As you can see, it's pretty impressive.  Imagine bolting one of these to 
your vanagon.  In the pictures it looks no bigger than the motor in my 
'92 Jetta, which is no bigger than yer average Rabbit diesel motor.  Who 
knows?  Maybe the 2.4TDI would fit--wheelies in your vanagon!
