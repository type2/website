What Joel said (backwrads) means counterclockwise.  The Bentley for 83-84
vanagons has a mistake (at least my Bentley is wrong) about this. It says
to turn the crank pulley 90 degress. More precisely it should be 90 degrees 
counterclockwise. I think this applies to all aircoooled bus/bug engines.
Oh, hydraulic lifters can (need to) be adjusted if they are repacked,
as described in the Bentley manual.
