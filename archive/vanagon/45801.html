Subject: westfalia

   I desperatly need your HELP!
since I was a child I was dreaming of having a westfalia camper ,and I
always had a super beetle , I finally bought my dream machine ,it is a 1970
westfalia.
I rebuilt the engine and now it is the turn for the interior, I need any
information I can get about this model ,I don't know how the acsessories are
supposed to work ( fridge,stove,water pump ).Also the heating system inside
the sleeping area I cannot figure out if it exist or not, the connection to
220volts 
current from the outside and what it is supposed to feed,the function of the
2 batteries I have on board ,especially that the manual I have is from the
VW company and it is describing the functions of the normal bus and not the
camper .I would apreciate your help,especially that I already have plans for
the month of August to tour Europe with it .I need any information I can get
,no matter what it costs .
       REGARDS   MOUNIR-ITALY .
