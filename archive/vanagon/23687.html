Subject: Moped carrier for Westfalia



Hi again,

	Sorry to bug you so soon again, but I've been looking for
a mailing list like this for a while now and just found out about 
it..

	I need to get a carrier to put on my Westfalia '86 that 
can stand the weight of a moped and a bike. My moped is only about
110 lbs (50 kg), but I guess that is still too much for a regular
bike-carrier. Has anyone got references (counter-references) to
give me? Has anyone in or near Switzerland got one for sale??
Are there advantages to having one that ties on the front/back
of the van?

Thanks a bunch!
