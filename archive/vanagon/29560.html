Subject: 1990 Engine Clatter

The noise you are experiencing is normal.  It is simply the noise created
from valve lifters that have lost oil pressure.  Rather than running the
vehicle (at idle?) for 10 to 15 minutes in your driveway, try running it on
the road (and through the gears) for about 20 minutes while closely
monitoring the temperature and oil pressure.  I'm quite sure that when you
get home the engine will sound the way it should.
