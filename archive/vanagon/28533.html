Subject:       MatchBox bus.

A recent string has reminded me of my collection of matchbox cars.
I have been collecting them for more years than I can remember and if 
any one has one to sell or knows where I could get a pre '80 bus It 
would make an excellent addition to my collection.  A white '72 to 
match my bus would be the cats petunias.  I am not picky about 
condition and hot wheels and ertl have also made their way into my 
collection over time.
Thanks.
Ed.
