If you do suspect your engine is too hot, and decide to stop, do you turn it
off, or let it idle so the fans keep blowing air over it?
My fatherinlaw, a long time bug driver (like from the early(?) forties
in the German army (something called a kubbelwagon) ;-))
still lifts the hood on his Pasat at the end of and long trip
to &quot;let the engine cool off&quot;. Is this an ex-aircooled habit that was 
necessary at some point? He is alway telling my I should open the engine
door on my van to let it cool off after any trip of more than 30minutes.
