&gt;Howdy,

&gt;I just got a new primary battery installed.  A Sears Diehard
&gt;International.  The battery has a vent, but Sears didn't connect it
&gt;to anything, and it's not apparant to me where it would connect.
&gt;
&gt;Where is the external vent connection for the primary battery?
&gt;Is it bad to leave the battery venting into the battery
&gt;compartment?

Look in the wheel well above the front passenger-side wheel and you should
see a corrugated tube about 1.5&quot; in diameter handing down a few inches. Buy
a couple of feet of clear vinyl tubing and snake it up this tube to your
battery compartment and connect to the battery vent. Batteries vent hydrogen
when charging so it's probably not a good idea to allow it to accumulate in
the battery compartment.
