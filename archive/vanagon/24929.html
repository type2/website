Subject: She purrs even in crosswinds

Hello everybody! I just got back from a test drive with my 1978 Westy.
Yesterday I replaced the lower bracket that holds the alternator and I tried
to figure out if there is still any problem or noise in my bus. I took her for
a 60 miles trip around San Juan at the same time that we are receiving the
first heavy winds (40-60 mph) and she was riding in a stable condition. Once
in a while the bus was shaked by hurricane Marilyn's winds. When that happened
I understood that it was time to come home. We are expecting very strong winds
(70-100 mph) in the late evening and about 10 inches of rain by tommorrow
morning. I put my Westy in a safe place waiting to go the 3rd Bug-In in the
city of Caguas on Sept. 24. I'll keep in touch ASAP.

Be good.
