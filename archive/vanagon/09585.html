So Dean Paul Karpowicz says:
&gt; Oh, yea, the black plastic that the heater/fan box is made out of tends to
&gt; be really brittle (I mean REALLY BRITTLE) so watch how you tighten those
&gt; screws back up.

Um, Dean, so are you gonna tell us where to get the replacement screws that
you drilled out and how to put them in or are we to be left in suspense with
the Chilton stand by 'installation is the reverse of removal'?  ;)

Enquiring minds yada-yada-yada....
