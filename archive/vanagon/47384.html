I get a magazine called &quot;Publish.&quot;
This months issue has a review for MacroMedia Extreme 3D. (whatever!)
As a demo of its luminosity/rendering capabilities several views of a bay
window are provided within a dialog box labeled &quot;67 Van.&quot; (HONK!~wrong~)

I took the time to seek out the website to see if online images may be &quot;viewed.&quot;
NO VW images are currently on-line but for more info about the product try

http://www.macromedia_dot_com/software/extreme3d/index.html

Watch the Gallery link for the image to appear. 50-50 chance that it will be
placed there.
