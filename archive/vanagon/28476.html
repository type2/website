Subject: Re: thermostat

Mitch, I'm no expert, but having fried two VW engines due to chronic
overheating, it makes sense to me to keep the cooling system as stock as
possible...including the thermostat. I also would be wary of that
doghouse with the ducts welded shut. You should be able to pick up
another doghouse pretty cheap with all the fried engines out there. The 
way I figure it, all those Porsche/VW engineers had to know more that me 
or Bubba about how their engines needed to be cooled.

Personally (the voice of only one-ever, recent rebuild), I'd pull the
engine and install the right stuff. It's too much work and too expensive
to rebuild an engine every 20,000 or 30,000, which is what I got on my
last two &quot;mechanic&quot;-serviced engines. Maybe it was the same guy who
butchered yours? Ever been to Arkansas? ') Joe

BTW, my message got bounced when I replied directly to your e-mail 
address. May be an incomplete table on my end, but thought you should know.
