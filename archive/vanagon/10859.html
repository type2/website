Subject: music festivals

I know, I know.  This does not have anything to do with micros, breadboxes or 
the younger genrations but it sort of does in a cursory way.

Does anyone have any information (re: dates and location) in regards to 
bluegrass music festivals such as the Rooney Festival in the Catskills which 
is held in August.  I've been to Rooney twice and am aware that others exist 
such as the Blue Herring Festival (sp).  To have a fun destination to go to 
for a weekend trip in the van always adds an extra level of enjoyment to the 
trip.  I am interested in so called festivals that would occur from New York 
to N. Carolina on both sides of the Appalacian Mtns.

Let me know your thoughts if you have ever attended any of these festivals 
and I will summarize the results for the list.

DIRECT EMAILS ONLY PLS, I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DISLOCATED FROM THE LIST FOR A 
WHILE.
