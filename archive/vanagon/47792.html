Subject: Blue LED's?, Valve adjustment procedure, buslust


	Yep, 80's VW products had something Blue that looked like an LED
for high-beams. I always intended to get a 'spare' and see what it was-
my guess is a lightbulb with a blue plastic cover. If its an LED, it'll
turn ON in micro-seconds, if an incandesent lamp, milliseconds, so  if
you're sharp-eyed, or can make a highspeed film or video of it
you can tell without sawing the thing apart. An led will conduct only
one way (its a diode after all) while a lamp will conduct both ways.

	Just for the record on GEX, my brother installed one of their
engines (and a trany I think) in his wife's first Beetle and liked it
fine. But they didn't keep it a long time. Tiresome old *%()$* that I am,
I find their 'ad art' offensive and bought my last rebuild from ECI, who
are no longer in business. So much for the warranty!  Pay your money,
take your chances. 

	William A. McKenley,
	Turning the *aircooled* engine backward for valve adjustment
of #s 4-3-2-1 is *EASIER*. You can be sure you're at the right place,
it takes less time, you can do both sets of valves under one valve
cover in sequence. My time and attention is *REAL*.

	Nancy,

	Busses are neat
	But seldom compleat
	Like owners who fix
	Nine faults with one stich (weld)
	For parts you will search
	Their power is worse
	Heaters perverse
	Up hills you will nurse
	And gently brake down
	(Say it brother)
	Gently break down
	(Sing it sister)
	Gently break down

	Time, money and friends,
	Your troubles will solve
	(Kautzes and Bradley and Rubins arrived 
	after the new engine revoloved
	With salad - bread - wine - dessert and
	new bungee cords)
	Though my brother half installed it
	He missed the pizza
	But dream for your bus
	Share with us your lust
	Happily, we act and we sin
	With a bus in your life
	And life in your bus
	You need no permission to begin!

	Keep taking the tablets!

	Bill
