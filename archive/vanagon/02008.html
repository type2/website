Subject: Re: Failing Fuel Pump?

I would replace the fuel pump fuse and the fuel filter whether you think you 
need to or not.  A plugged fuel filter can put a lot more load on the pump 
motor and thereby draw a lot more current through the pump power circuit.  I 
have had intermittent VW fuse failures in the past.
