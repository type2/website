Subject: 	Re: control arm bushings for 85 Westy

&gt;I'm in the process of getting parts together to do the control arm bushings 
on 
&gt;my 85 westy. I have found a few reasonable sources for the tops but no one 
has 
&gt;a part # for the bottom bushing . I have'nt gone to the dealer yet so I'm 
&gt;wondering if any one knows the # or if the top bushing can be used in the 
&gt;bottom; as well as a probable source for said bottom bush. Any advice would 
be 
&gt;great. Thanks, Tom Czerniak
&gt;

Tom:

        Are you replacing the bushings because of the terrible squeaking
when you go over a bump?
