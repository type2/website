&gt; &gt; I wouldn't even consider a motorhome with the EuroVan engine unless 
&gt; &gt; they squoze a VR6 in there.  110 hp (or whatever the EV has) is not 
&gt; &gt; near enough to drive a motorhome in the mountains!  (Speaking from a 
&gt; &gt; Rocky Mountain dwellers point of view. &lt;grin&gt;)
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I can't believe that I'm coming to the EuroVan's defense, but...:)
&gt; 
&gt; While the rated hp is around 108, it puts out 170-180 ft-lbs of torque.
&gt; Thats not far off what the VR6 produces. It is this torque (which is
&gt; produced at reasonable rpms) that, in my opinion, gives the van the hwy
&gt; cruising qualities that Bill and Ric enthuise about.
&gt; 
&gt; Its been said before but it bears repeating :
&gt; 
&gt; 	&quot;horsepower sells cars, torque wins races&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, actually, I think reliability wins a good share of races too ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Alistair, bravely wading into the hp vs torque tarpit

I think that this torque goes a long to way explaining why the pickup 
version of the 'EV' in Europe is rated for towing more than the American 
V8 pickups.  Its a shame we can't get VW pickups in this country.  I'd 
LOVE a pickup version of the T4 ('EV') or of the Synchro T3 ('Vanagon').
When I'm ready to 'dump' this S10 pickup of mine - done paying for the EV 
really - I might try to work on one of these.  I've heard there are ways 
to pickup the T4 truck in Europe and import it a couple weeks later.
