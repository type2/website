Lionel etc.,

I can't believe that you have that problem in GB.  Here in dry Phoenix Arizona it is common, and to me a major irritation.

There are two likely causes of your static electricity problem:

1) Your clothes and seat upholstery.  A classic static generator 
   when you exit the car.  The charge builds up between you and the 
   vehicle.  Mild, but annoying discharge between you and the car 
   any time during exit or even after, when you reach for the door 
   handle.

   I have learned the habit of holding onto some bare metal part of 
   the Vanagon as I exit.  This bleeds the charge as it is generated 
   so it can never build up to the level where it can be felt.

2) Tires.  Tires generate a static charge as they roll.  However, 
   most, but not all, tires have a high enough carbon content to 
   bleed the charge so that it doesn't build up.  For tires, the 
   charge builds up between the vehicle and the planet.  A more than 
   annoying discharge between you and the vehicle after your feet 
   are on the ground.  However, the shock may be very mild if your 
   shoes are good insulators.

   If you suspect this second kind of static build up, it may be 
   remedied with a ground strap (available at FLAPS) that is 
   attached to the frame and drags along on the road.  I'm sure that 
   you've seen these on trucks (lorries?).

Or, wait for rain.

Have a nice day,
Mike
