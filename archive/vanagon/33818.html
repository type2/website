Subject: PST Dead of Winter Campout


Peach State Transporters will be having it's &quot;Dead of Winter
Campout&quot; on February 10-11.  It will be held at Cloudland
Canyon State Park in the NW corner of Georgia (practically
in Tennessee).

So, for those of you who thought it was too cold at the Stone
Mountain campout last November...  BRING EXTRA BLANKETS!!!

Cloudland Canyon is a beautiful park with hiking trails around
the rim as well as down into the canyon.  There are two water
falls at the bottom.

For more details, you can email me at deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu

Dave
