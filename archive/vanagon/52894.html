Subject: Syncro Tire Rotation

I'm pretty sure we've discussed on the list, the tendency of the Syncro to
chew off the outside edge of the front tires (does anyone else remember
this). In any case, mine certainly does. I'm now at the point where having
rotated my tires front to back (about 10,000 miles ago), all four tires
have equally rounded outside edges.

So here's my question:  Should I have the tires rotated again, this time
dismounting them from the wheels and flipping them so that the relatively
unworn inside becomes the outside? Or will this just be a waste of
time/money? These are fairly aggressive tires with only about 20K miles on
them, and part of what I am wondering is whether my snow traction be better
with more tread to the outside of the tire (it seemed as if I had better
snow traction when the tires were new)?

Any Thoughts?
