I'll try to contain myself a bit since there are so many contented Westy
owners here. :-)

An Adventurewagen is camper van conversion performed by a small company
located in Fort Bragg, CA.. Between the mid-sixties to 1991 they built
their conversions on the VW bus, and later the Vanagon chassis. In 1992
after VW stopped importing the Vanagon they switched and are now building
their AW's on the Ford Club Wagon chassis. In my case they started with a
stock 1983 Vanagon GL waterboxer and then added their conversion package.

People could order a full conversion package or just the items they wanted,
a le carte. A full conversion has many similarities with a Westy but the
implementation may be different. Its' most distinguishing characteristic is
its' aerodynamic raised fiberglass roof rather than the Westy's canvas
pop-top. Headroom in my AW is 6'2&quot;. The aft top area contains an adjustable
double bed/storage area, and the forward area over the cab an 11 cubic foot
bulkhead cabinet. Unlike the Westy with main components aligned along the
driver's side the AW splits those items into two major groups. Behind the
driver is a wooden unit that contains a closet, vanity, kitchen cabinet,
spice rack/shelves, 10x14x5&quot; stainless steel sink with butcher block
cutting board 3/4 cover, 19 gal. fresh water tank with 12v pump, flip-up
shelf/table, and a 12,000 btu forced air propane furnace with house type
thermostat. Across the aisle behind the passenger seat is a matching wooden
cabinet holding a 2 cubic foot Norcold refrigerator, plate and utensil
drawer, and 2-burner range top with stainless steel cover. When the cargo
door is open the exterior side of this cabinet has a dish towel rack, two
shelves for canned goods, etc., and a flip-up shelf/table. This allows
someone the option to prepare food and cook while standing outside next to
the van. The refrigerator and furnace fan are powered by two 235 amp/hour
6v golf cart batteries or 115v shore power. The van's alternator recharges
these batteries and when new, or in good shape, they will last 3-5 days
without having to start up or move the van

A 20x26 folding table is in front of the stock Vanagon contoured rear bench
seat with armrests. The seatback is folded forward to get to the lower
47&quot;x75&quot; bed which pulls out fully made up with sheets and blanket in place.
There are a variety of storage areas around this rear area. The underside
of the van holds the propane tank and a 13 gal. holding tank for the sink.
Another option is a 4.3 gal. solar water tank which is attached on the roof
and accessed through the sunroof hatch. The kit includes the tank, regular
shower hose and wand, a custom shower curtain which attaches to a tub which
you stand in. A Thetford Porta-Potti with matching Vanagon fabric
upholstered cover is standard equipment. There are five reading lights, two
in the cab, and three in the cabin, as well as two florescent lamp housings
built into the roof.

While there are a lot of other things these are the major items.
