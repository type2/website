&lt;&lt; If I do tow it (all 4 on the ground, likely with a tow bar) are there any

The Bentley manual actually (perhaps not exactly) says:
&quot;Unlimited speed and unlimited distance&quot;
Makes me wonder how the tires would hold up towing it across the Bonneville
Salt Flats behind a rocket!!!

Good luck and let us know if you buy it.
