Subject:       Re: gas mileage and range

My Syncro's average mpg is 19. I start looking for a station at 320 
miles, and usually takes about 17 gals. 

I have a question for other syncro owener's about topping off the  
tank. When the pump kicks off there is about 5 gallons of air left in 
the tank. I need to pull the nozzle out so that it is just in the hole
and enough to keep the pump going. Then I have to pull the lever on 
and off for a few mins until the tank is full. It there a fix for 
this air bubble. This really got old after 200,000+ miles of pumping.

Thanks...   Paul Bjork  '87 Syncro
