Subject: N.C. Gathering report/ shame on you!!!! 
Date: Mon, 16 Oct 95 10:25:27 EDT
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

  I must start off by saying that Mr. Rob Tommaselli (hope that's
spelled right) came all the way down from NEW JERSEY!!!! So, anyone
living closer than that should be ashamed for not joining us.
 He was sporting a shiny, new '95 Eurovan Winnebago with *all* the
options.
Quite a smooth ride indeed.
 Anyway, he and his father joined regulars Stefan Ufer ('76) and myuself
('67) for a lovely evening at Umstead park.
A very imoprtant lesson learned was to ALWAYS have a big tarp in your
bus, as you never know when it will rain. Luckily, we were prepared, and
managed to keep a roaring fire going despite a good ninety minute
deluge.
 A gourmet meal of 'dogs n' beans was enjoyed by all, as well as a
delicious homemade salsa, courtesy of Rob.
The meal was topped off with plenty of s'mores, and then it was off to
bed, as the rain lulled us all to sleep.
 Anyway, I am counting on LOTS more people showing up in April, so mark
your calendars now...
Richard
