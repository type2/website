EUROBAGO HIGH ALT. FRIDGE--UPDATE

My van is in getting the upgrade.
Saw a VR6 with the upgrade.  Looks the same as before with one extra vent
below the other round vent.  After my talking to the dealership, they only
order vans with the upgrade.  They have 30 rentals and sell new ones.

The big question is who will pay.  I am hopeful.
I will let y'all know what happens.
