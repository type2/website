Q: How many Microbus owners does it take to change a light bulb?
&gt;
&gt;A: Yeah, but first you need go check your collection of several old bulbs
in the back yard. One for the filament, one with a good base, Genuine glass
from another... Maybe schedule a trip to Bulb-O-Rama if the parts arent all
present.
