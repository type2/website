Subject: removing radiator

Here I am, another list junkie waiting to ask a question. BTW, thanks guys
for all the hard work on the list.

Has anyone dropped the radiator out of an 89 vanagon with air conditioning.
I have'nt seriously tried it yet, but the two freon lines running
underneath the the radiator appear to have it stopped from dropping
straight down. Do these lines have to be removed or is there room to jockey
the radiator around them?
