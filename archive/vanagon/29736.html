Subject: VW Magazine conspiracy revealed...
Date: Tue, 28 Nov 95 12:21:43 EST
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

Here's something to think about...

I am in the process of moving, and therefore changing my mailing address
for various scholarly publications that I receive, among them both Hot
VW's and VW Trends. (there *are* good bus pictures every now and then.)
Anyway, I called the subscription info hotline for one (I forget which
was first), and spoke with a nice customer server. I hung up, and called
another number for the other magazine. The voice I spoke with sounded
familiar, and as I gave my address, imagine my surprise as she filled it
in! I confirmed that indeed it was the young lady I had just spoken with,
and related my surprise at the two publications being related. She
laughed, and said that indeed it is all the same thing....
   Anyway, just thought that was a rather curious thing. PLEASE do not
respond with any thoughts as to the content of these publications, why
anyone would read them, etc...
Richard
