&gt;okay, been cruising round lately, me and rumba, doing great...then yesterday
&gt;i
&gt;notice a definite lack of power and my brakes are stiff. hmmm...maybe i hear
&gt;a vaccum leak to..hmmm...okay, i've yet to track down the leak but i got
some
&gt;new vacuum hose and will put that on shortly. question: what is the purpose
&gt;of
&gt;a one way vaccum valve? i have one that joins two seperate vaccum
&gt;hoses..which
&gt;is really one..but joined together by this one way vacuum valve. do these
&gt;wear
&gt;out? do they get clogged? i hear a leak under there..seems to be coming from
&gt;this valve...any suggestions? on a side note, i cleaned the carb and put on
a
&gt;new fuel filter, both were dirty and now we seem to run better.
&gt;
&gt;

The vacuum valve is needed to maintain a constant vacum supply in the brake
booster.  Since the manifold only has a high vacuum during idle,  vacuum
needs to be stored and 1/2 the volume of the brake booster is used for that
purpose.
