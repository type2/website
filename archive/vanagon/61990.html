 &gt;&gt; &gt;The compressor seems to make alot of noise (as if the bearing are worn)
 &gt;I was wondering is this normal?

        Are you sure the noise is bearing noise? If it's an intermittent
        (or even steady) squeaking/squealing sound, it may be that you
        need to adjust or replace the A/C compressor's belt... &lt;&lt;

 Amen to that.  Shoot a little hair spray on the belt while it's moving - if
the noise stops, you've got the culprit.  I installed at least 3 water pumps
on various Fords before I learned this little trick...
