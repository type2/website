&gt;here in the East, where most state parks are $8-$12 a night. Some 
&gt;of the sites out there are $25 or $35!  You could get a nice hotel 
&gt;room for that much around here!)  Half-Moon Bay State Beach looked 
&gt;good, but they don't take reservations and they tell me they'll 
&gt;certainly be filled by that Friday because it's a holiday weekend.

Not quite there, but very nice, is Marble Quarry RV park, about 4 hours east
and in the Sierra Nevada foothills.  Marble Quarry is a very nice park
located within walking distance of the historic town of Columbia, and within
an hour or so of Yosemite.

It's definitely worth the drive if you plan on spending a few days.
