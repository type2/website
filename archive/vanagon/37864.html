Subject: Re: Mods to install door speakers in v-gon?


I put Advent 10&quot;'s in the front door bottom.  Built a box that fills
the footwell.  These, plus Infinity CS-5&quot;, tweeter, 3 amps and
active crossover sound pretty good.

Jpg's on request.

 &gt;&gt;Has anybody else put larger door speakers in the v-gon doors?  I don't

 &gt;
 &gt;Actually, my installer claims that the best place to install speakers is in
 &gt;the kick panels, down in the bottom outside corners.  This comes closest to
 &gt;equalizing the speaker-&gt;listener distance.
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;One further question:  what kind of aftermarket sound systems have list 
 &gt;&gt;members installed in the v-gon?  I was thinking 5.25 mid/tweeter separates 
 &gt;&gt;in the doors, a 3 way amp driving them and an 8&quot; woofer in the board under 
 &gt;&gt;the rear bench.  Then at a later date, adding another 2 way amp driving 
 &gt;&gt;6x9's in the airconditioning unit where the rear 4&quot; speakers are.
 &gt;
 &gt;Great topic for discussion, since I'm slowly upgrading the sound in my van.
 &gt;I got a PPI 4x25 amp installed recently, as well as a Sony CDX600 head unit.
 &gt;The speakers that I want are the next (and very expensive) step, one I
 &gt;probably won't make this year, with Inuvik on the horizon.
 &gt;
 &gt;Can you fit 6x9 speakers in the air conditioning unit?
 &gt;
 &gt;One problem I keep trying to figure out is how to install speakers so that
 &gt;the sound is great from both the driving and the sleeping positions.  I
 &gt;think it's near impossible without a HUGE budget.
