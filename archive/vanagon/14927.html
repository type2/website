Subject: EuroVan's got new shoes!!


Yep, UPS came by Monday with 4 new Michelin MXVs from Tire Rack ($80 a
pop)....so off I went to the local tire store to get them mounted..
they incidentally said they couldn't get the MXVs and tried to sell
me regular car tires....Hmmmmmm.....

Well, it took Tire Rack two separate orders to Michelin because
they (Michelin) only release 2 of these tires at a time...some sort
of Consumer Hold I was told.

Bottom line...it was worth the wait!! I thought the EV always handled
good, and yep...I'm a legend in my own mind when it comes to late
braking for exit ramps and giving the ABS a workout  ;-), but compared
to the Michelins, the Contis that came with the EV were REAL CRAP!!!
I'll never, never buy Contis again!!

With the Contis the EV, in the words of them NASCAR good ole boys, had
a bit of a &quot;push&quot;....well the &quot;push&quot; is gone!! I wonder if there is
an SCCA autox class for EVs??
