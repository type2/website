Hi Normen,

As strange as this sounds, I've don't believe ever having seen someone
recommend doing this, but I think it's a good idea.

Something to do when checking out a vanagon to purchase--(I don't think
this applies to diesels)

If possible drive it around for at least one hour, longer if possible. 
I dealt with an extremely annoying problem and have read numerous
requests for help for the same phenomena from many listees.  A vanagon
can work absolutely perfect for about an hour and then exhibit various
symptoms such as loss of power, intermittent cut-out, dying on the side
of the road, and/or idle searching.  This problem is typically due to
something itty-bitty, tiny, possibly cheap, but extremely tedious to
diagnose.  It's best to know about such things before taking a trip home
with it.  I could have EASILY sold my vanagon to someone in Baton Rouge
that would only drive it on short trips (i.e. commutes, errands, etc). 
The unsuspecting new owner could easily own the van for MONTHS before
taking a trip and run into this.  While mine was acting up, the dealer
even said that they couldn't find anything wrong with it!  Indeed, while
mine was doing this, I temporarily traded vehicles with my
father-in-law.  He worked here local and used the vanagon for running
about town.  My work at the time was 60 miles away and the van insisted
on dying about 10 miles from work.  If it was a cool morning, it might
make it there, but would die on the way home.  My father-in-law never
had anything but exceptional performance from the vanagon while he was
using it.

Now as I said, it's usually something minor causing all the problems. 
With mine, it was a $12 sensor.  But it took 9 months to find out that
that's what it was (and many many dollars to the ole' part changers, aka
mechanics, who couldn't figure out what was wrong with it)!  For others,
it's been wiring, or ground straps, or vacuum lines, or ...

Point of story--It is aggravating enough to make you want to get rid of
the thing, so, if possible drive it around until it's had an opportunity
to get good and hot (at least an hour, maybe longer in cooler
climates).  At least you'll know if you're going to have to play
detective or not.

Also, there are a number of things you also have to look at in a
Syncro.  If you don't get replies from syncro-ites, check the archives
for testing information for syncro-specific stuff.

Good luck finding one!

&gt; Besides the head gasket leak what other problems should I look for.
