Subject: Re: found a syncro..need help 

&gt;After many a &quot;wanna syncro westy&quot; posting, I think that I've found one! A 
&gt;91 with 21,000 miles... I have to sell my kids to get it....I'm most 
&gt;interested in comments about specifics to be checked out on the rig 
&gt;before purchase,  any comments?
&gt;
At 21,000 miles it should be perfect! No H2O leaks, no visible 
corrosion/dried anti-freeze build-up near the headgaskets and bolts. Same 
warnings as to any wasserboxer van I guess. Check fridge, H2O pump, connect 
to street H2O and make sure all that is tight. Canvas OK? skylight ? roof 
rubber... Syncro bits, how easy is it to shift? Mine is terrible to get into 
1st or 2nd from neutral, low is ok. Locking diff ok? Does the engagement 
light come on when knob is out? Drive it in a tight circle on DIRT road only 
and see if the inside rear wheel is really churning up the ground, this will 
show the axle is locked. Any major underbody damage from offroading? Ball 
joints? (any clunking on washboard roads) Wheel bearings? (any droning on 
the highway). CV joints all PERFECT, no tears, no stray grease. 
U-joints/seals, look for leaks where shaft exits trans / front diff. Brakes? 
Power steering rack leaks? Heater? AC?
        Try the thing for a weekend before you commit, you need to drive it 
a fair amount to detect any bugs, ie. the ball joint won't show up in 
highway driving. A quick drive on potholed dirt roads will let you hear what 
is loose. There are other '91s on the list, maybe more concerns?  tim s.
