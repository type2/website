Subject: Bonehead Newbie has Questions...

Hi all!

After many years of wating and wanting, I am now the proud owner of a 1985
Auto-Westy Weekender (174K, but in remarkably good shape for a 'northern'
Vanagon).

As with many used vehicles, this one didn't come with even a whisper of an
owner's manual, so I really need some help until the Bentley arrives....

1.  Power steering.  Found the reservoir -- it's low, but I do not know what
the recommendation is for fluid type.  ATF dipstick demands Dexron, but the
PS doesn't say...

2.  Brake fluid reservoir (here's the Bonehead part).  Where is it?
I think that I've found everything else (washer fluid containers, fuel tank
overflow lines, coolant reservoir and expansion tank, extra battery
compartment and connectors, etc.) just not the master cylinder.  I'd really
like to make sure that I am not peilously close to a dry cylinder, and all
help will be appreciated!
