&gt; Seriously, tho.  I've camped several times when I've gone surfing.  I had
&gt; totally blacked out windows and a canvas separator behind the front seat.

How did you black out the windows?

My approach:

I placed some velcro strips on various parts of the ceiling and windows 
edging. If I camp, I often attach some rubberized, black window covers 
like they sell in photo development stores...to black out the room. No 
light comes through. Velcro makes it easy to put up and take down, and 
permits the cuts to just fit each window and keep the light out...and in.

I also put a strip of velcro on the bottom edge of the rear ceiling where 
the air conditioner sometimes goes. At night I can hang one of the black 
out curtains from that and it keeps the rear most area of the lower bed 
in total darkness without requireming me to put up the front curtain at 
the front seats..... which can tip off folks that you're there.

I've also found that I can enjoy a really quiet night in a city setting 
by using these soft little foam rubber ear plugs.....absolutely silent. 
In fact... a few times I have slept near an airport and with these plugs, 
I didn't even hear the planes take off and land.

I find that my sleep is much better with these little gestures....even in 
a serene remote area. The morning sunlight doesn't wake one prematurely, 
and the silence is deep.
