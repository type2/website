&gt;Yeah, I'd love a 20 gallon tank, but I'd be happy with 15 gallons.  And 
&gt;rumour has it that a 68-72 tank will fit in the split window buses.  
&gt;They go for $17 at the wrecking yard here, and look like they should 
&gt;fit.  

Yes, they will fit.  I got one for $5 at U-pull-it here in Sac.  The
difference is that the 15gallon tank has is taller in the middle, and
has a big hole in the top for the fuel guage sender.

I wanna hook up a fuel guage for mine, anyone know if it will work on
6V, and how in the heck its wired?
