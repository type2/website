I did mine myself ('89 Vanagon).  I got a new pump for $61.82.  The
installation was a pain in the but because of the factory hose clamps (they
are hard to remove without the proper pliers).  Also, the pump is mounted on
studs and it takes a bit of jiggering to get it clear so that you can remove
it.  If fact the Bentley manual says, &quot;The water pump can be removed without
removing the engine.&quot;  Which is code for it is going to seem impossible, but
you can get it out.

The job is not difficult, just a bit time consuming.  Especially since you
have to refill and bleed the cooling system.  It helps if you have a helper
when you get to this part!  

Just follow the instructions in Bentley and you'll be fine.

Lots of luck,

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;I have a noise from my 1986 Vanagon engine compartment.  Upon further
&gt;investigation I find that the waterpump bearing has a lot of play and is
&gt;getting ready to let go.  Does anyone care to venture a guess at what this
&gt;job could cost. I wonder if I can do it myself.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas will be welcomed
