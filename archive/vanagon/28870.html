&gt; whaaaaaat?   A bus is a type 2.    T2=transporter of all models (truck,
&gt; ambulance, 21 window, vanagon et.)
&gt; 
&gt;   Does this mean post 67?

Yep, all buses are type II, but the bay window is a T2.  It's the 4 
distinct bus type, T1 for splits, T2 for bay windows, T3 for Vanagons, 
and T4 for EVs.

And speaking of T2s... I have an opportunity to get another '77 for a 
good price, but not running.  Seems complete, and in decent shape, and 
has a sun roof.  Is a '77 7seater w/sunroof worth ~$500 not running?  

Hey Joel... who has the most buses on the list, and how many more do I 
need to beat them.  :)  Oh... and all three of mine run too.
