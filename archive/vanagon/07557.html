&gt;About a month ago, someone posted about a product by 3m which was some
&gt;kind of sealant goop you could put around/in/under your window &quot;seals&quot; to
&gt;keep the rain out. Anybody heard of this stuff or something similar? I've
&gt;had my windshields replaced as well as the seals, but they still leak
&gt;rain water onto my stereo. Help!!

if it was 3M, it was probably me. :)  the stuff i use is 3M Heavy Drip-Check
Sealer, part number 08531 ... but you'll have to get it at the folks who sell
supplies to the body shop repair people. look in the yellow pages for the
Auto Repair Suppliers catagory.

you'll also want to get some 3M General Purpose Adhesive Remover ... to clean
up any oozing out from under the rubber. this stuff works great on bugs and
road tar, too. it leaves a little white film, but that washes off with water.
