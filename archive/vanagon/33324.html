Subject: More Barndoor Pix

I've uploaded some new picture s of my barndor to my '54 Resto Page
(http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/54resto.html)

I hope to have some more bus pix scanned sometime this week.  A gut at work
sez he can scan them, so we'll see how it turns out...

I think I just need to buy a scanner...
