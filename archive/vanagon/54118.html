Subject: * IS AN '86 GL SYNCRO A GOOD BUY?? *

Hi,

I am considering buying the following, any info within the next few days
(weekend) would be sincerely appreciated.. =)

The Beast in Question:

- 1986 Vanagon GL Syncro
- 143,000 Miles
- AC (option)
- Rear Wiper (option)
- Locking Rear Differential (option)
- Metallic Silver-Blue Paint (option)
- Straight body, no apparent damage, other than small scratches
- Cracked windshield
- Defective rear heater core (being replaced by  current owner)

* Asking price: $4000.00

* ANY SPECIFIC TESTS that I can perform myself to check the Heads, Viscous
  Coupling, Driveshaft, etc?

* I will be taking it to have mechanic(s) look at it- what should I have
  them look for in a pre-purchase inspection that is SPECIFIC to this
vehicle?
  Viscous Couplings, Driveshaft, CV's, etc..

* Any suggestions for any EXCELLENT (non-dealer or dealer) mechanics in
  the Portland, Oregon area?

* Could someone explain to me the merits/de-merits of this year and model
  of Syncro Vanagon?

* I'd like to correspond with other owners of same, if possible.. Swap
  heart-felt stories of joy, or veritable tales o' horr-ah, what have you..

* Please respond via e-mail and/or here..
