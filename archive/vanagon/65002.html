Subject:      Re: S&amp;S Headers

What is this &quot;sniffer&quot; tube?  I installed the S&amp;S headers, Turbo Muffler
and CAT - Seems all was in place...

My gas mileage is also up about 1.5 mpg, with a notable power difference
(especially in 3rd gear..)

&gt; The U-tube is missing the sniffer tube that the stock one has - I
&gt; don't think it would be too much trouble to have one welded on - but it is a
&gt; notable omission.
