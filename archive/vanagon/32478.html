Subject: RE: Don't Swap -- Add!


&gt;How about this approach to building a faster Vanagon:  take a Syncro,
&gt;replace trans with 2wd trans.  Replace center driveshaft with engine
&gt;and trans from a front-engine, rear-drive car, driving the front diff.
&gt;No modifications needed to the rear deck area, use the new engine cover
&gt;as a table, and no emissions hassles (unless you mention the other
&gt;engine).  You could even go hybrid, with an electric motor for the
&gt;front wheels and gas for the back.


Awwww... I was going to put the superconducting magnetic levitation
device there.

Back to the drawing board.
