Subject: Vanagon/Eurovan rentals in Colorado?

I'll be flying out to Colorado in the beginning of August and will need to
rent a car for an all too brief driving tour of the state - 10 days only :-(

Does anyone know of a livery that handles Vanagons or Eurovans. I need a lot
of headroom, and don't find enough in most vehicles, other than a Volvo or
full-size pickup.  

We will either fly into Denver and go from there, take a shuttle flight to
Durango and start in the bottom left corner of the map.  Any suggestions
would be appreciated.
