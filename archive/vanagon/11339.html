Sam,
	You obviously have never seen my bus.  Or Bradley's bus, for that
matter.  I take pride in the fact that my bus is probably one of the
ugliest on the planet.  Just ask anyone that went to the Big Sur trip.  :)
In fact, I think I will stage an ugly bus contest at the Red Rock campout.
Entry fee will be $5 with a $5 grand prize.   Or maybe a big can of prunes.
Did I mention that I'm judging it?
