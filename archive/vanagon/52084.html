Subject: Re: Exhaust Pipes 2.1 86and up!

&gt; Maybe everyone can put in $10 and buy a test set for... uummm... Malcom. 
&gt; He should give us a complete report!  ;)

Hey, why pick on me!  I *know* I'm opinionated...

Well, actually I *was* thinking about a set.  I wonder if they'll fit
a Syncro, since the pipes are different.  My are way rusty, but I really
wanted a nice stainless set...
