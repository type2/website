Iif getting sprayed while filling up, maybe the simplest solution, particularly

Iis to flip the little lever on the pump handle (where available) iso it will

Iautomatically and shut off when full.  Then get the hell out of the way and let 
Iher blow! :)


	I agree with Larry on the above,but I might add that when
	getting out of the way, remain in sight of the pump
	handle. once on a trip through ohio i stopped at
	a 76 station, and because i wanted to reach chicago
	before nightfall i set up that little lock lever
	on the pump handle and let her blow, while i ran
	off to the bathroom (trying to save time). when i
	came out there was a sea of gasoline spilling out
	all over the place like old faithful. the station
	owner just sat there watching, so i ran to stop
	it . the station owner blamed my car, but it
	was something with his pump, and as i was in
	a rush and had no time to argue, i had to
	leave the place paying for all that gas that
	spilled !
	moral: two things at once, maybe not better.
