Subject: Re: Rubber seal

&gt;Hi volks,
&gt;  I'm new to the list. Don't know what's kept me so long. Hopefully I'll 
&gt;be able to help someone out (own an '89 Westy with it's share of foibles) 
&gt;but for now I'm looking for advice. The seal around the cap (poptop 
&gt;section) never seemed to be properly attached from day1. I drove the van 
&gt;for the first couple of winters and freeze/thaw made a bad situation 
&gt;worse. Wound up peeling the whole thing off. The metal strip inside was 
&gt;badly corroded. I removed it and cleaned up the inside of the rubber 
&gt;strip assuming I would be able to glue it to the cap directly using 
&gt;&quot;goop&quot; or someother sort of product. 
&gt;    Has anybody tried this or is it necessary to purchase a seal with the 
&gt;metal clips inside?
&gt;   Phil
&gt;   '89 Westy
