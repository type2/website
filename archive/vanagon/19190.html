The Schwarzmiester/GNATT Tour is about to crash my house!

I just got a call from Bradley and they were enroute coming
down I-5 and looking for a place to regroup and Martha wants/
needs a shower.  David S. asked if there were any more people
that were planning to hook up.  I told him that I hadn't seen
anything, so if any of you ARE planning on meeting with him
then please email me or post.

later...
