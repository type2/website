&gt; For your puzzlement and Friday entertainment, I donate to the public
&gt; domain of the vanagon list the following crossword puzzle. It's small but
&gt; it's good!
&gt; 
&gt; This is a 5 by 5 crossword.  Each entry is five letters; there aren't
&gt; any &quot;black squares&quot;.  It is sort of in the spirit of Ted Shane.  I
&gt; recommend a collective effort here if you get stuck on any of the entries.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Across:
&gt; What the German Shepherd's tail was doin (when he got to ride in the vanagon)
&gt; Part of A DIAMOND, could be A FIRST
&gt; Old _____ Home, type of import junkyard
&gt; Eventempered Underpowered Longlasting Easygoing Throttlers, organization of
&gt;   those of us who hurry slowly!
&gt; What you have to come up with for the spouse when you've dropped another
&gt;   thou on a beautiful restorable old brick carcass
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Down:
&gt; What the friendly brick driver does upon sighting another friendly
&gt;   brick driver
&gt; A way to come when sailing
&gt; Swilled by sots, downed by drunks, dipped by dipsos--by the gallon!
&gt; A long narrow ridge or mound of sand, gravel, and boulders deposited by
&gt;   a stream flowing on, within, or beneath a stagnant glacier.  Also,
&gt;   a practitioner of the art of esking.
&gt; Like a Westy (that's been all fixed up to be homey)
&gt; 
&gt; Humbly submitted for your approval:

W A G I N
A B A S E
