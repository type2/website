Subject: Re: Engine Questions

I just got my GEX engine.  I have all of the accessories from the engine I
used to have.  NOW what should I do.  I noticed that there was a little tag
near the distriributor mount which said &quot;Do not rotate engine until dist is
installed&quot;

Why?
 - - - - - - - -  
so the distributor drive shaft doesn't pop out away from the gears.    it
would have been set in right by the engine builders, and if it is off a
couple teeth the spark won't be right.


Is it becvause it has been set at TDC?  Does this mean I could set the
pulley wheel correctly as well?
 - - - - - - - - - 
the crank pulley?   there is only one way to put it on, as the is a key way
on the pulley.

happy assembling!
