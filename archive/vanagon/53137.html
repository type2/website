Subject: Archives are still broken...


last night I wrote:

    I fixed another egregious bug in the archiver.  It wasn't locking the
    directory.  I believe some of the problems I was seeing with the archiver
    were because multiple copies were running and stepping on one another's
    toes.  I fixed that problem.  We'll see if things work a little better.

Well, I'm sorry to say that appears not to have been the problem, so I'm
back to manually stuffing batches of messages into the archive.

Sorry,
