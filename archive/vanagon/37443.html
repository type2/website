&gt; &gt;Sounds good to me. Unfortunately, the surplus gun turrets
&gt; &gt;from all those WWII bombers, are pretty much sold out by
&gt; &gt;now...

&gt; Maybe Q from James Bond's technical department could come

What would be really cool would be a transmitter/interrupter that you 
could use to talk over on their cel-phone channel.  &quot;Hey you bleeping 
bleepard, why don't you hang up that bleeping phone and try to pay 
attention to the bleeping road!&quot;

Kind of reminds me of a friend of mind who had a 15 watt FM transmitter 
up in his attic. He would do the cute boyfriend thing and play songs on 
the radio for his girlfriend...awww. Unfortunately, every tuned into a 
particular local T.V. station would be watching Dr. Quinn in the 
foreground and hearing Pearl Jam in the background.  Never saw that lady 
rock out so hard in my life before.  That wild wild west....
