&gt; Looking at my maps, Prudhoe Bay is significantly further north than Inuvik.

Yes, Prudhoe Bay (70.20 N) _is_ farther north than Inuvik (68.25 N) by a 
little under 2 degrees latitude, or about 117 nautical miles.  I love 
going for the extremes; however:

1) Last I heard, this road (the Dalton Highway, from Fairbanks to Prudhoe 
Bay) is closed to the public, and is for access to the Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline by maintainence crews, and for supply shipments to the camp at 
Prudhoe Bay.  If this has changed, and the Dalton Hwy is open for public 
travel all the way to Prudhoe Bay, I'd like to hear about it. 

2) Because the road primarily follows the pipeline, views are often of, 
well, the pipeline.  The Dalton was built to service the pipeline, 
whereas the Dempster Hwy to Inuvik was built in typical Canadian fashion 
because the government felt is was essential to...  to...  well, just 
'cause!  :)  Consequently, the Dempster offers views of no industry at all.

3) I know nothing of the road conditions on the Dalton, but if it's 
typical of unpaved industrial haul roads, it may well be rougher than a 
lot of people might want to subject their vehicles to.  The Dempster 
is at least graded and maintained to some extent, even though the term 
&quot;highway&quot; is used a lot more loosely than those of us who don't live 
North of 60 would expect.

4) I'm pissed about the Alaskan fishery mess, and until this thing gets 
sorted out, and the Alaskans show some good faith in the dispute (like 
not fishing the heck out of salmon spawning in BC rivers), I'm a little 
reluctant to go dumping my tourist bucks into the state.  Flame away, 
if you must: I feel it's my perogative to spend my money where I want, 
and if I disagree with policies endorsed by a state, I'll use what little 
economic power I have to express my feelings.  I'm sure many of you would 
balk at spending money on things or in places with policies you find 
disagreeable as well.  Sorry for the non-vanagon content, but this issue 
is vaguely vanagon-related in that it affects my feeling regarding 
the route for the Far North trip.  Hopefully this whole fishing dispute 
thing will get worked out by next summer anyway, so the issue will 
become moot by the time we start the trip.  
 
Really, though, I think all those who might be interested in 
participating in this thing should consider points 1, 2, and 3 first.  If 
point 4 is still an issue next summer, we'll deal with it then.
