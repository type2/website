Subject: wtt: rabbit for van...

i have an 84 rabbit gti, not too much rust and a siezed engine, id like to
trade it for a van.  I have 2 complete interiors, enough stuff to build 1
good one, with some effort.

i am looking for a vanagon, but will consider busses, running is of
course, optional...

thanks, 

stephen white
