Subject: Re: /f Road hazards (overpasses)

&gt;A lady that I work with and I were discussing why I don't park the Vanagon
&gt;Westy in the parking garage with the seven foot clearence and the uneven
&gt;concrete with the hanging water pipes etc. Her story was that her son has
&gt;been a truck driver for years. She told of a time that he used a concrete
&gt;over pass to peel a load of new fork lifts off the back of his flat bed 18
&gt;wheeler at 65mph+. Jeesh!, If I were the traffic behind him at that point
&gt;I'd wish that a deer had jumped out in front of me instead! I've been the
&gt;deer route and can't imagine the scene. BTW: no injuries, just DOT driving
&gt;school for the trucker.

I saw something like that when I lived in Indianapolis, only it was a load of
new Buicks.  Made the top three convertibles!

I also saw an overpass on I65 between Indianapolis and Louisville, KY after a
flatbed with one of those BIG dump trucks that they use on construction areas
hit it.  The overpass was knocked off the supports and on to I65 (over the
southbound side) northbound side was almost.
