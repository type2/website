&gt;&gt;An informed discussion and/or pointers to 12v solar panel stuff would
&gt;&gt;be interesting.  Now that summer is here I'd love to implement a solar
&gt;&gt;powered ventilation system.  Anyone seen such?

Well, David Schwarze started it and I'm following into his footsteps. We
both have a set of 4 solar panels, each 1 by 4 ft. in size.  The set is
rated at 87 Watt. David has his already installed, while I'm struggling to
find time on a rainless day. 

Another problem is that those 4 panels weight about 20 pounds and they
will make the pop-top so much more difficult to lift. Maybe some gas
struts would help. I'm also very nervous about drilling holes into the
pop-top. Maybe a couple of beers would help. :-)

David?
