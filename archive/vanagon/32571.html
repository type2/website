Subject: VWoA Warranties?
Date: Thu, 11 Jan 96 13:57:00 PST


I have seen some postings lately regarding VWoA working out warranty deals 
with folks experiencing engine faults (Bad Heads, leaks etc).  These were 
mostly surrounding 87 and up watercooled Vgons with 80k + miles on them.  I 
am experiencing some head leaks in a VW Factory longblock bought new three 
years ago and put into 83 aircooled Vgon.  This engine has about 35k on it 
now and is leaking oil at the heads, I have not checked if it is the valve 
covers or a full blown head leak (will find out this weekend).  I  was 
wondering, if it is indeed a problem with the heads, will VWoA be as 
generous with me as they have been with you watercooled or is this something 
I should discuss with shop that installed it?  I am more than happy to do 
the valve gaskets but head work may be over my head at this point.

Just thinking while I should be working, TIA.
