&gt;
&gt;Vanatics,
&gt;I was wondering who has the newest Vanagon on the list?  If you 
have a 1991
&gt;Vanagon and would like to see if your's is the newest on the list, 
send
&gt; your
&gt;VIN (vehicle identification number) to me.  I'll keep a list and 
let the
&gt;whole list know the result.  BTW, your VIN will likely read 
something like:
&gt;WV2YB0259MH999999, where the last 6 digits (999999 in the example)
&gt; represent
&gt;the sequential production number.  
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Jim Davis
