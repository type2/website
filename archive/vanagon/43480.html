Subject: questions about '83

        Well got back yesterday from my second weekend trip in a row, which
was even better than the first. Some friends and I went out to a local lake
and hung at the beach all day. Met this guy how had parked just down from
me in a '78 and he said he had the original tent with it, but then
mentioned that it attached to the back. So how big are those things and how
do they even attach? He trook off with his kids so I did pester him with
too many questions.

        Also, while I was cooking lunch (some Tex-mex Klik in a can) I
fionally tried to start my right burner, but to no avail. I cant seem to
even turn the knob to the on position. Has anyone had any similar problems?
I got back late so didnt get a chance to fiddle with it, but I plan aon
cleaning her tonight and wanted to solve that little problem. Any
suggestion would be welcomed.

        Now my next question may seem very stupid but I know nothing about
brakes. My front right brake is starting to scream at me a bit whenever I
am forced to brake somewhat quickly or hard. Is there anything I can do
myself about his or is this a problem that I'll end up having to take to a
shop. I have limited tools, but do have a friend who has some I could
borrow, and Im veryt willing to try to fox it myself as I dont have much
cash and the cash I do have wil be spent moving out in two weeks. So please
someone give me a schooling in the brake dept. Thanks.

        I also saw the MOST gorgeous samba bus painted green and white with
wood panelling and a cool lookin roof rack. Absolutely amazing machine. I
know where it is and plan to take a photo on thursday so Ill try to post it
somehwere for ya all.

take care.
Mike
