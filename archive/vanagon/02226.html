To be truthful 400 miles a day is a lot - in a vote i would go for less
too Will but am worried such a civilised pace will cause time crunches -
alas it would with me, assuming i can even join up (i have a relatively new
business and cant afford time-wise to be away unless i can sell this
bridge between Brooklyn and Manhattan...

Of course miles/day figure will vary with region !!
