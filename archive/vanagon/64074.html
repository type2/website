Subject: RE:Tires for 91 westy - options?

I have owned Coopers before and replaced them in short order. As I recall they
did not stay round ;|. They were an economy tire and I guess you get what you
pay for. This was 15 years ago. -Things can change-.

       The only other choice the dealer has available was one I'd 
       never heard of: 
       
       Cooper Signet 185/80SR14
       8-ply
       $63
       
       Has anyone ever heard of this tire brand?
