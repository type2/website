&gt; is that for real? i thought that was just a myth ... put out by the tire
&gt; companies. do the little sticky beasties really eat tires and rubber hoses?
&gt; 

I've had porcupines eat wooden shovel handles before, but I dunno about
rubber...

However, if you have one of those old VW engines that have the wood-filled
pushrods you'd wanna keep in motion through porcupine country!  ;-)

No, it's not Friday yet...
