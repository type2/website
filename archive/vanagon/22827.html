Good luck w/your EV.....

I could not find a floormat for the back that I liked, so I went to a
hardware/home improvement store that had a sale on small carpets,
bought a 5' wide carpet for $20.00 .  It was real easy to cut with a sharp
knife.  For extra protection from the kids, I placed a layer of nylon
(heavy duty garbage bags) underneath it, cut out the holes where the
heater is and where the seat mounts are.

It seems to have worked reasonable well so far...
