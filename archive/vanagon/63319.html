Subject:      New Beetle Doings

     Though not strictly a Vanagon issue, I thought I'd pass this along:

     A few weeks ago, I signed up as an &quot;interested&quot; party of the New
     (Concept) Beetle on the V.A.G. (Germany) web page.  Yesterday, I got
     an envelope from Germany with a somewhat informative letter about the
     new car and a complimentary pin/tie tack depicting the design of the
     car as &quot;two little bumps under a bigger bump&quot; meant to represent the
     side profile of the car.  Pretty cool.
