Yes, it is possible.  It's also possible that while doing this you or your
mechanic might inadvertently allow some metal shavings to fall into the
cylinder.  Instant cylinder-wall scoring and loss of compression.  Just
bite the bullet, remove the cylinder head, and do the job the safe way.
It's a lot cheaper than an engine rebuild.  All IMO, of course - others may
tell you different.
