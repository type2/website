Subject: Re: philosoph.advice 


&gt;I have a '65 split window, original paint, original interior (excpt 
&gt;uplstry), only a little rust (under the battery), with a '71  1600 SP, 
&gt;original leaking trans, original leaking weather stripping. It sounds 
&gt;pretty desperate but it runs well and looks pretty nice too.
&gt;  My wife and 
&gt;I are planning to move from Western Colorado (Dry) to the Twin Cities (Wet).
&gt;I am continually wrestling with the idea (and the cost) of a complete 
&gt;restoration, but sometimes I feel that it is necessary in order to keep 
&gt;this 30 yr. old vehicle on the road.

I stand by a product sold as &quot;Rust Check&quot;, you can buy spray tins or get the 
franchise to spray you, for $100 or so. First time around, let them do it, 
as they really soak the vehicle, in cavities, underside etc. Powerwash your 
van underneath thoroughly, say the day after a long drive in the rain to 
loosen the dirt up first. Once the RC has set up, say a week, spray the 
wheel wells inside with underbody coating, lots of it, 4-6 tins. Spray the 
crossbeams where they show gravel rash etc. Under the battery tray, corners. 
This will keep the underside intact for 2 bad winters, ie sand/salt/slush, 
then re-spray the undercoating. Buy the biggest ugliest mudflaps you can 
find for the front wheels, this takes a load off the underside. Keeping the 
body OK is harder, wax well and try to rinse off the surface crud 
periodically when you get a warmish winter day. Good luck on the 
preservation trail.   tim s.
