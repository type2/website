Oh I just had to wade in...


the mention of veg oil as a fuel for diesels reminded me of something I 
heard on the radio last year - a round the world motorboat trip, diesel 
engined and fueled by used oil from deep fat fryers (no, not the monk 
like creatures).

just keep scarfing that fast food and y'all can drive...

i had heard of farmers using canola or sunflower oil in their tractors, 
some mods had to be made else the fuel system got gummed up a bit.
