Subject: HELP! FI Fuel Supply(?) Problems with 75 Westy in Phoenix (fwd)
Date: Thu, 5 Jan 95 14:39:15 PST

So jds_at_media.mit_dot_edu says:
&gt;   Any ideas?  Please respond to me directly; I receive
&gt; the mailing list digested.  I really like Phoenix, but
&gt; I've been here tooo long.
&gt; 

My guess is that you've got some crud in your injectors and
they need to be cleaned out or replaced.  Have the shop take
a look at the spray pattern and see what they say.  I'm speculating
that the increased ethanol has moved some crud that was further
back in your fuel system and into the injector(s).

Good Luck

Steven
