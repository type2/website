Subject: Anyone have a  floor-to-dash heat coupler for an '82 vgon?

I tossed my 82 vanagon's floor-to-dash heat coupler in the trash this summer
thinking it was a part of a vaccuum cleaner that I junked... oops!  It is
a black plastic piece about 10 inches (?) long - its round on the one end
(to mate w/heat vent coming up from the floor) and oval on the other end
(to mate w.the dash board connector)  All my heat is going into heating
the solid metal part of the dash assy... I tell you, its like sitting
in front of a fireplace!  Anyway, if anyone is parting out and wants
to sell this part, I'll buy it, otherwise its off the local wrecking
yard.
