Paul,

I used to haul a lot of gasoline to service stations.  I loaded it all 
from the Williams Brothers pipeline terminal in Coralville, and delivered 
it to Mobile, all kinds of off-brands, etc.  The gas came out of the same 
pipe, but some might have different additives mixed during loading.  The 
additigves could be injected in the gas stream as it was pumped on board.
