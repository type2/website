Subject: RE: Vanagon Alternator Wires

One larger wire would be stiff and increase the possibility of breakage at the 
connections.  Especially with all the movement a Vanagon engine has to offer.  
These wires though are still too small to carry the full output of the 
alternator without heating up and causing an excessive voltage drop.  I run 
another #8 wire from the alternator to the fuse box.  Makes a noticeable 
difference in light brightness.

Hello,

Perhaps someone can tell me why there are two wires going from the
alternator to the starter (and main battery) instead of one FAT one?  As
far as the wiring diagram shows, they come from the same place and go to
the same place.  Is it for redundancy or leftovers from an older stock
system?  Would a larger gauge wire affect current flow or something like
that?

Thanks,

Noel Leavitt
