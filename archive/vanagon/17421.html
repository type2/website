Jeff Rosen would like to scoop in more air into the engine compartment of
a '78 bus. I don't think this would help much since the volume of cooling
air is determined by the fan's rotational speed, i.e., engine rpm. &quot;VW's
engineers probably knew what they were doing.&quot;

When we travelled through Arizona 2 years ago, the oil temp kept getting
higher and higher on a long uphill road to Flagstaff. So I decided to
drive with an open engine lid, which was certainly a mistake because of
the back pressure it creates.
