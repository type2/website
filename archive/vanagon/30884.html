Subject: sunroof like i Jurassic Park

&gt;Subject: sunroof like in Jurassic Park

&gt;I really wish I had a sunroof to expand the angle of vision
&gt;and double the pleasures of sight-seeing. With a wide
&gt;sunroof reaching far down towards the windshield, we could
&gt;see summets during mountainous drives.

I looked at a splittie single cab a few years ago that had
that done.  The roof was cut off at the drip channel and
replaced with several pie-shaped pieces of plexi-glass.
Since there was very little in the way of fresh-air venting
and very little roof, it was fairly easily done.  Sitting in
the driver's seat it had the effect of being in an old WWII
bomber, but you could see from 8:00 to 4:00 with very little
obstruction.
