Subject: Vanagon Windshields

Soon I will be repairing some damage inflicted on the front of my 
vanagon.  I can remove the windshield when painting but I'll probably 
break it if past experience is anything to go on.  So . . .

How much do new windshields cost?  Anybody ever find just a really 
great deal?  If so, where?

TIA,

Greg
