Subject: Alternator Repair

Hello All,
	My alt stopped putting out electricity, red lite on all the time. I
cleaned all the connections and tightened the belt. Using a meter the
battery was still less than 12V with the engine running. Bad news. An alt
for my '86 was somewhere between $150 &amp; $200.
	I took it off and took it into a Starter/Alternator repair shop this
morning. They called this afternoon, the brushes were worn out. 
	They are changing the brushes and fixing the commutator (right word? The
surface the brushes ride on). I'm going to pick it up in the morning $40!
	I'm going to change the plastic water fitting under the alt while I have
the alt off. Picked up the fitting today, I just need to get the gasket.
	I'm happy. Now if I can find a bushing for the front blower motor....

	Rob
