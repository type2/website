The West Coast Metric windsheild seals look like crap, and they leak.  There
are all kind of extranneous marks on them, not a very clean mold.  The
Wolfsburg West ones looked a lot nicer.

I have used the WW seals and the windsheilds don't leak.   I found some seals
at a flea market that were even better, though, but their origion was lost.
  I have heard bad things about WCM rubber, too.  (Worst Coast Metric)

The seals for the doors are WAY too stiff.  The seals on my 42 year bus are
much more pliable than these things were out of the box.  Makes the doors
very hard to close.  (WCM)

i use original door seal rubber.    I grab it out of every  junk bus i can.
 If you look at the repro stuff, it is made completely differently than the
VW stuff.  It came as one kind of rubber wrapped around a different core, yet
the repro is all one stuff.    And costs way too much.   

pop out window scrapers are another sore point.   I'm finding NOS stuff to
put on my resto project.   I have  repro seals on the 66 standard, and they
are very difficult to open and close.   But the bus is pretty airand
watertight.

my local vw shop gets very nice engine compartment to motor seals for only
~$9

the knee bangers reproed are the wrong colour.

picky picky, aren't I
