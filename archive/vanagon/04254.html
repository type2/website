&gt; 
&gt; Food for thought (fuel for VW's):  does anyone have an opinion
&gt; (silly question!) as to whether super or regular gasoline makes

Martha,

  Based upon my understanding of Combustion Principles, NuBus
runs much better on Diesel Fuel. YMMV, but I *always* use 
diesel fuel. I do not believe I would get anywhere near the 30 MPG
i get using regular.  So, switch to Diesel (you may need some slight
engine modifications for best performance)

 NuBus is coming home this afternoon. It has another engine, and it
will be treated to a complete washing and interior cleaning. After reading
about all the trouble the gas-burners have, I *know* I made the right choice
of sticking with an oil-burning engine.

p.s. According to my Chem E. buddy (who may be wrong), regular and super
both have the same BTUs/gallon, and in a well-running vehicle, will
deliver the same performance.
