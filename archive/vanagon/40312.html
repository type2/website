Subject: Jalousie window rubber is in! (at hand)

Not installed yet.

Picked up the grey rubber gasket &quot;spline&quot; poop for around the jalousie
windows this afternoon. The guage of the rubber is a bit thinner than stock
but promises to to look pretty good (close but not exact) when installed. At
least it's fresh, not weathered.
I will wait to install before making any proclimations of victory. The stuff
cost me something like $12.00 (US) for 35-40'.  I could have had the 100'
roll for $30 but I figured ther would be more where that came from. It is a
regularly available item.  I will let you all know how it goes.
First impression is that absolute purists might want to stick with the old
dried useless stock stuff for the &quot;look.&quot; The soaking of the stock gaskets
in Goop provided marginal if any results. Just made them smell like Goop amd
got the dirt off.
