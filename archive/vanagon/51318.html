Subject: automatic vanagon wanted in Phoenix

Yesterday I recieved a call from someone via an ad for a Vanagon that I have
for sale. &lt;separate thread&gt; The fella was looking for an automatic vanagon.
His wife insists on the autotranny. If you are selling (or feel stuck with)
a nice van of this sort within the SW USA please email me privately for the
fellas phone or for me to pass along the vitals of your Vanagon. He really
would like a later model but he called on an '80- so who knows...
thanks-

Please no need to start a thread re: the virtues of auto vs. manual. That
has been discussed to death...
