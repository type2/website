So David Garth says:
&gt; Hi all!
&gt; 
&gt; My '86 Westfalia has begun to lean towards the drivers side. It's been 
&gt; gradually getting lower on the left, but still handles fine with even 
&gt; tire wear.
&gt; 
&gt; My mechanic says the springs are sagging. Cost to replace (VW OEM, with 
&gt; labor): $1,100. GULP! He says the only after market spring that he knew 
&gt; about were the same price.
&gt; 
&gt; Any brilliant ideas out there in Vanagon-land?

Umm....lower the other side with Bus-Boys lowering kit?  ;)

Look at your old replacement coolant line receipts and say to yourself,
&quot;This ain't so bad.&quot;  ;)

I have this sag too.... maybe we can trade springs from opposite sides? ;p
(I take the passenger side ones from your's... okay? ;) )

Obviously, I don't have any good answers but I'd definitely shop around 
for other opinions.
