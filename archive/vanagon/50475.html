Subject: Power Window problem

Hello,

The bracket which hold's the power window ondriver's side my 87 Westy
shattered.  (I rolled up a metal pay phone cord  up on it to block traffic
noise...don't do that!)  At any rate the motor works....the part's $120 plus
installation.  Can I switch the one from the passenger side to the driver's
side or does anyone know of a less expensive source for this part.  The
motor's fine.

Thanks for any help.

Craig Charles
