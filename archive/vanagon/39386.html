Subject: Double Cab

All,

I'm looking for a nice double cab, any year, Splitty - Bubble - Vanagon.  I
would like to find one that is straight, solid, and complete.  Must be
drivable (long distance) from day one.  I am not looking for a major project.
 If it needs paint and/or upholstery to be perfect that's okay.  Willing to
pay for a nice one.  Dedicated long-term VW enthusiast.

All leads appreciated.
