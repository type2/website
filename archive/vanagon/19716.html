So Roy Jared Michael says:
&gt; 
&gt; I live in Boulder CO. I have been talking to Verners VW and Wolfgang's VW 
&gt; repair. Both have quoted me around $2200 - $2500 for the rebuild. Or I 
&gt; can get one from GEX for around $1600 plus $400 core charge plus either 
&gt; place will put the GEX one in for $400. What should I do? All the places 
&gt; offer 12 months 12,000 miles.

I think I'd go with the local guy.  That way if anything goes wrong, you
can complain to them directly.  GEX is in the mags, but I rather (if I
had to) be able to get in the persons face if something goes wrong and
they're not willing to fix it.


FWIW - I look at it from a different view - At least in theory, the GEX
engines are completly rebuilt on a production line basis.  That means
standardization and experience.   How many rebuilds on this type of engine
does the local guy do, and when was the last one done?  If the GEX blows up
underwarranty, and your local guy is reputable, you should have no problem. 
If it is out of warranty - you are probably on your own in any case.  Based on
an insignificant sample size of 1 -  when I needed a longblock to replace my
vanagon diesel, the GEX route was the most cost effective, and since
rebuilding VW diesels is not common to most shops, a production rebuild seemed
to offer the best chance of a good product.
