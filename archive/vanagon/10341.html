Today I replaced the fan switch in my 82 (the three speed for the
defroster). What amazes me is that this kind of item is available
aftermarket (apparently the same as used on Rabbits). 

I bought the switch at a  place David Schwarze took me
to  in San Diego called
Vee Auto. They seemed to have everything, except for one thing. Both
David S. and I are looking for the sump plate provided with the 914. This
plate apparently has a take up for an oil temp sender and fits perfectly
on the Vanagon 2.0 l. All Vee had was the simple screw in sender which
apparently leaks badly.

Anyway with the fan now working, the auxiliary fan installed in the heater
pipe and the front air intake blocked off, it is now possible to get
a decent blast of hot air up front to all defrosters. The two fans combined
does the trick. The tube fan pulls the hot air from the back and the OEM
fan throws it up on the windshield. DC
