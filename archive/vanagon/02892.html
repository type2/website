&gt;Joel's post about a 'Rovorx' or something like that sounded to me like
&gt;a Wankel type compressor - especially the note about the seal life.
&gt;Dont know if this is right or not ???

almost. it's actually a little like a wankel turned inside out. sort of.
the rotating part is circular, and the chamber is elliptical (almost like
a football shape). to the seals only work to compress/expand on the sides
of the chamber, not all the way round (like in a wankel).

&gt;Its a little sad when you realise there is no marketability for solutions
&gt;that require a yearly seal change, or the like, compared to more
&gt;expensive solutions that are intervention free (the whole industry
&gt;reflects this). Basically there arent many of us willing to 'put up' with
&gt;a car that needs tickling twice a year....oh well lets not go that
&gt;thread again ...

yup. it's a sad day, but it's the Way of the Future: NO Maintenance. No More
Tune-Ups for 100,000 miles on the new Ford Whatsit. which means: gee, folks,
you don't even have to look under the hood for 6 or 7 YEARS!! oh, well.
