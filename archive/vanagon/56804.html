 Actually, by California Standards, it's quite a bargain  (I've seen =
some in
excess of 80,000 miles go for over $20K!!!)
  &gt;&gt;

that's practically more than they cost NEW!!

Yea, I know.  I wish I had bought one 10 years ago, driven it 100,000 =
miles, and could now MAKE MONEY by selling it to someone else!!!  (And =
let *them* deal with the inevitable collapse of the drivetrain &lt;g&gt;)

I have pretty much given up on buying a Syncro for this reason.  (My =
wife would *kill* me if I paid $20,000-plus for a 10 year old car unless =
it was a damned Ferrari!)
