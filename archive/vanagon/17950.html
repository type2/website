Hi All,

I can't remember if I put this out before, but her it goes...  last year, I had 
an opportunity to weigh in on a truck scale that measured in 25# increments and 
my Syncro Westie tipped the scales at 4750#.  The factory stated weight for my 
Syncro is quoted at 3900+ # and at first I couldn't figure out the discrepancy 
between the manual and the actual readout.  I finally realized that the factory 
weight is without ANY options such as power windows/door locks, air 
conditioning, awnings, portapotties, radio systems, etc., etc....    and to 
think....  I have a whopping 90 HP to get me down the road!!

&gt;I don't have the exact weight figures, but I remember the EV weighing
&gt;about 400 lbs more than a Vanagon.


The curb weight of a base CL is 3806 lbs, GL is 3839 lbs, and the
MV is 4246 lbs.  I'm presuming this is w/o the poptop.

109 horsies pulling over two tons won't put you on the pole at Indy,
but, hey, if you can block people's view and bully them with bulk
who needs power!   ;-)
