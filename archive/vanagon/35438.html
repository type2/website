Subject: Re: Something positive

I drive my '81 Vanagon daily.  It has 149K on the original bottom-end (PO 
put new heads on at 100K) and I have had no major problems (unless you 
count yesterday's problem with one of the blower motors on the gas 
heater).  It receives irregular maintenance (meaning I don't do it as 
often as I should).  I've been very happy with it. :-)  The others 
haven't run in years.

&gt; have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
&gt; one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt; without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
&gt; be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.
