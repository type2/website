&gt; 	This tire has a load carrying capacity of 1710 lbs at 65 lbs of 
&gt; 	air pressure, 1530 lbs carrying capacity at 55 lbs of air pressure, 
&gt; 	and 1435 lbs of carrying capacity at 45 lbs of air pressure.  
&gt; 	As many of you know, Harry Yates likes this tire and says it is 
&gt; 	an &quot;excellent&quot; all season tire.
&gt; 
I just ordered a set of Yokohoma 185/75 R14 Load Range C.
I don't know the model # or the load carrying capacity, but will post it 
when I pick them up next week.  A friend of mine has been running these 
on an '83 Vanagon for 3 months now and likes them a lot.  They are about 
$80/tire.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have experience with any of these tires,  it would be great if you 
&gt; would share it with the rest of us.
