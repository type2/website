&gt;some other thoughts:
&gt;
&gt;fuel system pressure
&gt;
&gt;throttle switch (full throttle enrichment) on the throttle shaft-thingie=
=2E
&gt;
&gt;evaporative emissions system ... might be leaking.
&gt;
&gt;good luck.

&gt;

fuel pressure was OK at 30

I replaced the switch a while ago as the idle cutout was not working.  It=

is set kind of tight as the engine surges when I start it up until I give=

the gas pedal a touch.  The throttle shaft is a little loose but not too
bad.  Sounds like one area to look at.

OK I'll check that out too.

Thanks for the help

John
