Subject:       Body work update

I stopped by the body shop that has our van today.  Work is 
progressing.  They had all the new sheet metal in (NO body filler!!) 
and I was pleased to see that the replacement panels were original VW 
items.  Then it got me to thinking...  maybe there IS no aftermarket 
panels for the Vanagon.  Anyone know?

they had done the cutouts for the camper stuff-- nice job.  
Hopefully, they will be EXACTLY where the original ones were...

seeing all the metal filings and dust and cramped work areas (ie
wheel wells) really makes me glad i don't have to 'work' for a
living  :)
