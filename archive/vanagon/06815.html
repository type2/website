Subject: '56 Kombi Progress, Rocker Panel

	First of all, thanks for all the input on the crank start setup.  I
would probably just try it once or twice, but at least now I won't
maim myself!

	I welded the outer rocker up tonight, and this proved to much more
of a job than it should have been.  The outer rocker that I got from
West Coast Metric didn't fit for beans!  There was not enough curvature
at the bottom for it to fit properly, necessitating some &quot;adjustments&quot;
on my part.  Hmmmph!  In order get it tack welded, I had to hold the panel
with one hand (using a hammer) and weld with the other.  A lousy way
to do things but it worked.

	I also ended up drilling holes in the side rails, and using a long screw
to coax the panel up to where it was s'posed to be.  Prior to this, I'd 
flanged the recieving side.  I also applied a liberal amount of undercoating
to the complete inside of this assembly and then sprayed some more down along
where the two pieces join just before welding it.  I'm not taking any chances
here!
	
	I only made one little booboo, and that was trimming the front part
a wee bit short, by about 1/8-1/4&quot;  I now have to find a creative way to fill
this gap, which is made more difficult because it's 1/16&quot; away from the seam,
and the new rocker panel didn't have the flange to make a new one...

	This weekend doesn't look like I'll get mus bus stuff done, gotta new
nephew to visit and gramps turns 80 tomorrow, and then I promised the SO
I replace the guibo on her BMW...
