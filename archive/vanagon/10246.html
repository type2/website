&gt; 
&gt; I looked at an '87 Vanagon last night (I'm still a wannabus) and smelled that
&gt; sweet smell when I turned the heat on.  (I think it was mostly from the
&gt; rear heater).  Is this something to be concerned about?

The rear heater is either still leaking coolant or has at some point in 
the past.  There was a technical service bulletin issued on the rear heater
bleeder screw and the T housing that the heater hoses connect to.  My bleeder
screw was leaking and upon replacement the problem was solved.  The heater 
core itself could be the culprit.  Ascending in cost to repair would be as
follows:  Bleeder Screw, T Housing, Heater Core.

Due to the absorbant characteristics of the fiber floorboard used in the 
Vanagon I still smell coolant from the rear heater and I did everything
I could to clean up the mess, i.e. removed carpet and floorboard, rinsed,
shampooed and dried in the sun for several days.


&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, it's a 87 GL Wolfsburg with the weekender package, AC, 4spd, 105K mi,
&gt; in excellent condition.  Asking 5500$.
