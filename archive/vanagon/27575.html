Subject: RE:65 bus won't start

I thought I'd give those who responded to my cry for help
an update concerning my won't start problem.  I determined
the engine was receiving fuel so it had to be something
electrical. A few days ago I checked to see if the coil, distributor
and plugs were receiving power.  Yep, they were getting power.  Decided to
check the coil again today and got no reading! So, I traced
the wire coming from the ignition switch and bingo!  Apparently
the PO must have ran out of wire half way between the ignition and the
coil and slapped on another piece of wire using only tape to keep them
together.  Well, I connected the two wires up and presto, bingo,
bango...she starts right up!

Although searching for the problem was a big headache I learned
a great deal from the experience, especially about carburetors. 
Thanks to all those who responded.


&gt;Your responses had great advice, most of which was to check that the
&gt;This morning I went to start my bus and it turned over like every
&gt;other morning. But after a few seconds it just died. Tried again to
&gt;start it and everything is churning but it won't start. So, I let it
&gt;sit for 5 minutes(thinking maybe it is flooded) and try to start it
&gt;again. Starts right up but again in a few seconds it dies. Applying
&gt;the accelerator pedal to keep it idling didn't work.
&gt;
&gt;I let it sit again for a few minutes and try once more but get the
&gt;same results.  I was late for work so I didn't get a chance to check
&gt;things out thoroughly.  I'm pretty much a novice mechanic, so any
&gt;ideas on what to check or if someone has had a similar problem,
&gt;your help would be much appreciated.

&gt;Your responses had great advice, most of which was to check that the
&gt;fuel lines were unclogged and that the fuel pump is pumping fuel.  I 
&gt;thoroughly checked all fuel lines(no clogs) and the fuel pump is indeed
&gt;pumping fuel.  So, I assume the culprit to be the carburetor. I check all
&gt;of its electrical connections and fiddle with the valve on top of the 
&gt;carburetor(where the air cleaner connects) then decide to try and see if it
&gt;starts. It starts right up!

&gt;Two days later it won't start again. Again, I fiddle with the carburetor and
&gt;once more made sure the fuel pump is pumping fuel. Still won't start. It does 
&gt;have gas, by the way.  So, I take the carburetor off, look at its insides, 
&gt;things look OK(nothing loose or free), clean it up then put it back on. 
&gt;Nothing.
