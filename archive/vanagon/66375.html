Subject:      Re: Propex heater

&gt; With regards to the Propex heater, can it be operated while the vehicle
&gt; is in motion?

My origional instructions advised against it (1992).  BUT, I have
inadvertantly and with no ill effects.  I suppose its all down to how
you route the intake &amp; exhaust pipes!

Does air ever come in the vent pipe and blow the furnace
&gt; out?

NO.  but it may if its facing forward under the vehicle.  The exhaust
pipe MUST vent to the side of the vehicle and to the REAR if your
heating and moving!

&gt; You guys are making the Propex sound like THE heat solution for an
&gt; air-cooled van.  Now the question is, where can I get one?  Does anyone
&gt; have one for sale (in the U.S.)?

I've not anything more VW-like!

Chris Gibbs
