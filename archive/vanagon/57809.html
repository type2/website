&gt;I think you're being a tad harsh.  VW isn't selling the specified book, 


this is an out of print document, last printed in 1984.  Yes the copyright
still holds, and VW have refused xerox permission. This is a shame.  On the
other hand...
  The document covers engine/chassis protection for 1200cc Beetles, Type2s,
vanagons both diesel and gas. It is particulary apt for 2WD vanagons, and
the fabrication drawings are nice to have (er... ahem, well) As far as
useful driving information, it is very limited, a nice list of spare parts
to pack before a long trip to nowhere, and tiny bit of info on dirt track /
desert roads. Plus how to crack a tire bead off by jacking down on the tire.
Try a visit to your library for a better book on off road driving technique.
The real worth is the skid plate dwgs, which can be reproduced in any CAD
system in about an hour, then redistributed?  Don't know how the penalty for
that would be? Anyone?

One frustrating point to note is that none of the bits fit Syncros, except
for jackpost protectors, maybe spare tire cover.  Book predates the Syncro,
but you do sense that VW recognized the potential of the vanagon as an
'overland' vehicle.  In Africa (Australia?) primarily, not in the
boulder/bog strewn and dense arboreal forests of North America.
