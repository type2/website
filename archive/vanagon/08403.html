Subject: Re: Fuel line replacement


Indeedy, yes.  There is a piece of fuel line that connects the tank to 
the steel piece, which runs through the engine tin back into the engine 
compartment.

&gt; I have replaced all of the fuel lines on my 71 bus that I can see.  
&gt; There is a metal line running from the fire wall in the front (FIF) of
&gt; the motor and I replaced everything from there back.  Bentley mentions
&gt; something about how this metal line is hooked to the tank by a 
&gt; flexible line.  I think this was right.  There were no pictures or 
&gt; description here or in Muir.  I would think one or both of these books
&gt; should have a detailed description on how to replace all your fuel 
&gt; lines.  So, is there one in there that I missed and how do I get to 
&gt; it?  Oh, just a FYI.  I ordered the 801 series and a catalog from Berg 
&gt; last week.  The woman on the phone said $30.94, the receipt in the 
&gt; package said $30.94.  My Visa was charged $30.94 plus the $5.70 
&gt; shipping.  I don't have a problem paying this but was a little miffed 
&gt; that I was never told about it.  Is this a common occurance from them 
&gt; or a one time goof?  TIA for any help with my fuel lines, Jim.
