Subject: RE: Type 2 Engine Mount


&gt;&gt;several of these things used with no apparent ill effects. But some older
&gt;&gt;engines (maybe 1300cc and smaller?) had 6mm studs holding the oil pump
&gt;&gt;cover on instead of the stronger 8mm studs used in later engines. I'm
&gt;
&gt;        Uhh, correct me if I'm wrong here-the rear busmount was used on
&gt;'68-'71 models, right? And these models came with respectively, '68-'70
&gt;1600SP and '71 1600DP, right? So who in thier right mind would put a 1300
&gt;in thier '68-'71??? Just a thought...   ;-) Although if some masachist
&gt;*really* wanted a 1300 in his breadloaf, who am I to say no?  ;-)


Exactly. I have seen a 1300cc in a baywindow bus, in the U.S. no less.
Personally I wouldn't do this-- my tendency is toward larger engines
rather than smaller, as a few listmembers may have noticed.  :^)

But if some college student just toasted his 1600 and still has to get
to work next Monday, then that old bug engine under the tarp out back
may offer a more viable alternative than walking. And with a busmount
adapter it will virtually bolt right in (well, if it's 6V he'll have to
change that too). I was just noting a potential problem with stress on
the oil pump cover studs, especially the little ones.

I've seen bugs in countries other than the US, with a bewildering
variety of engines that came as standard equipment, so I was told. In
the Philippines, for example, there are 1971 bugs that came standard
with 1300cc engines from the factory. The guy I talked to, was incredulous
at the idea of a 1600cc engine in ANY bug-- I was referring to a custom-
built hot rod, right? I don't think I ever did convince him that 1600s
were standard in the US from the late '60s on.

I wasn't looking at buses at the time, so I don't know if these &quot;smaller&quot;
engines were also available in breadloaf buses in these countries. In the
US, bug and bus engines from the same model year were always the same size
until 1972, weren't they? If that's also true of the overseas buses (don't
ask me), then there might well have been 1200cc or 1300 cc baywindows in
some of these countries. Buses needed bigger engines even more than bugs
did-- Maybe these overseas buses followed the same upgrade lines as US
buses did? Anyone know?

In the U.S., as you correctly point out, all baywindow buses came with 
various
1600cc type-1 engines, or with 1700cc or larger type-4 engines after 1971.
But 'tain't necessarily so in other countries.
