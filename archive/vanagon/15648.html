Subject: Weekenders and Stuff

hello.. i am having a difficult time finding my dream van, so i was wondering...

what was the earliest year vanagon to come with the weekender package, (fold 
down bed)

can i/how much will it be to put a weekender bed in a normal vanagon?
I REALLY WANT A BED, I PLAN TO DO TONS OF TRAVELING

if i can install one of these, where can i get one, from VW? or maybe jc 
whitney's VW only catalog, (actually i dont think this really exists, i have 
called them 3 times about sending me one, and each time they send me a 
regular one, are these people retarded?)

i just talked to a guy who was considering selling his brown/light brown 
vanagon GL, 1985, he says it leaks no oil, he changes the oil like every 70 
days i think he said, BUT has been using prestone, is this a RED FLAG? 
should i avoid this at all costs?

an another bit of news, kmart/walmart is selling rand mc nally road atlases 
for 4 bux, which is like half price, grab em while you can road trippers.

Drive Safely.
