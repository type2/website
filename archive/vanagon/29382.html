Subject: Bus autocross?

OK, It's late I'm reaching on this one, but I'm wondering if
anyone would be interested in autocrossing Buses/Vanagons etc.
Stupid as this sound I truly have got to the point where it seems
I can hustle the RWD Bus through the corners damn near as fast
as the Corrado.  A Bus really doesn't handle badly it is just
the often profound body roll that makes one uncomfortable.  Recently
I joined a local group who is getting together to road rally VW's
of all kinds, Buses, Bugs, Jettas, my Corrado etc.  But it seems
some timed autocross events might be really cool for a Bus, since
brute power isn't what they are about, instead handling and good low
end torque.  I imagine these anti roll skids attached to the jack points
like outriggers to keep anyone from rolling, and a standard sort of
autocross course.  Could be REAL interesting and a whole lot of fun,
hell maybe we could even start a whole gambit of aftermarket performance
handling parts then a magazine deicated to hot rodding Type II's and
and and.

Oh BTW I won't be here Friday.
Later Everybody
John
