Subject: Emissions

Thanks to the generous help of this list (especially Mike Catlin, Bob
Hoover, Jack Reed, and Yvonne Reineke) I passed the Emissions Test.
Things I did -- 
  retarded the timing
  Backed out the CO screw. (More CO less HC)
  Tightened  down a loose exhaust pipe bolt (Off the #1 cylinder)
  Set the idle higher 

Ironically, the test results were the best I've ever had (even cmpared
with the one from when I had the van tuned by a real mechanic (who knew
vanagons) at a real garage). 

Finals were 
HC: 137 CO:  00.74 CO2: 06.9
Max 220       1.20 Min   4.0
 
YES!
