The 205/70 have a diameter of 205 x .7 =143.5, while the 205/75 have a
diameter of 153.75. The difference is about 7% in circumference, which
will lower your speedo reading, increase road clearance by about 2 inches,
increase your top speed, diminish torque, improve quiet, but reduce engine
cooling for given speed.
