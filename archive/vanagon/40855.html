Subject: Re: Buying the VW Shop: The Fantasy

Hmm.. All I need to do is convince my 'boss' (I 
independently work me computer stuff outside of 
business)...
..who is in the taiwanese body panel business. Yes, all
them chevy pickups with the fixed fenders made out of 
old toyotas..or whatever cars they have in China..

..that he aughta invest in this. He could ship me
the body parts to sell independently, and...

..aaag. this is distracting me heavily from reality.

this after hanging out w/ our local veedub/subaru
repair guy.. spent an hour just staring at scattered
engines (reference, eh, for when I tear down them 
vanagon heads)

While I was there: 
I saw one of the weirdest kit cars that ever came out of
a catalog... Looked like a mustang w/ a camaro front
end.. rear tires giant, giant...a '92 model, didn't
know people still had such bad taste..
w/ a standard 1600 engine. currently being rebuilt.
There weren't any vents I could see, I fear this monster
likes to eat vw engines.. just airflow from the wheel
wells, nothing else,, looked like a beer keg for
a gas tank.. two seats. Just Plain Ugly Assembling..
Plastic side windows! sheew...

Charlie &quot;Does owning more than one vw make one a shop?&quot;C
