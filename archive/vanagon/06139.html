Sorry for the slow reply, but I'm with the group that favors the
coast instead of the Sierras (at least during winter).  Someone
mentioned the campgrounds by Morro Bay.  Montana de Oro and
Los Osos state parks are choice.   Plus, us surfers can do our
best imitations of shark food at Morro Rock.

Pick a weekend, any weekend.
