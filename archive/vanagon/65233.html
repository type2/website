Subject:      VW EuroVan chassis &quot;Rialta&quot;

The last time I looked at one I was surprised by the small amount of ground
clearance of the gray water pipe.  Furthermore the pipe descends forward
toward the front.  As I examined it I imagined that it could get hung up on
a curbing when the front wheels were high and the rear wheels were still
low.  But, better than my imagination, is to hear from users.  Jim.
&gt;
&gt;I've seen a couple of real live motor homes based on the EV chassis.  These
&gt;are called Rialtas.  Anybody know anything about them, who makes them, how
&gt;much they go for?   Though small for a typical motor home they are much
&gt;larger than a EV Winnebago camper.  Probably a bathroom and microwave in
&gt;there somewhere but I haven't gotten a peek inside yet.
