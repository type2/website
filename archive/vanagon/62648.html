&gt; How does one go about removing the interior panel on the sliding door w/o
&gt; damaging anything.  I need to access the handle which has become loose.
&gt; TIA!

I drilled a 3/8&quot;hole directly opposite the location of the handle (refer
to bentley) and removed with magnetic screwdriver (careful now). 
Inserted similar plug to other white ones on door.  Worked for me since
my 83.5's inside panel is a little brittle.
