Special rubber? Only if you want to switch to silicone.
Try, Castrol GT/LMA low moisture absorbtion formula,
at your favorite WALMART for $1.70 or so a pint. It is
DOT 4, a supersedence of DOT 3 and fully compatible.
DOT 4 has been VW reccomended since the mid/late 80's.
If you want the full exotic, VW sells the ATE made super
DOT 4 rated stuff (may be bluish in color) for $5+ per
pint but the Castrol is just dandy, use it in all my
families VW's.
