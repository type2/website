&gt;FS: '67 Camper Bus
&gt;
&gt;Hi.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, I live in the Vancouver WA- Portland OR area. I have a '67 camper
&gt;Bus that I need to sell. The bus itself is in fair condition. It needs
&gt;some body and transmission work in order to be fully restored. However, I
&gt;recently installed a new clutch, and gave it a tune-up. The buyer will
&gt;also receive a child's cot, a full sized canopy that can be used when
&gt;camping, and of course, all the owner's manual. I'm willing to sell it for
&gt;$600 or best offer. If you are interested, please send e-mail to
&gt;orclord_at_mail.pacifier_dot_com.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your time.

&gt;HI ALL: The bus is gone. I know because I bought it. It happened to be
about 10 blocks away form my house and turned out to be a very good deal. My
wife didn't speak to me for a couple of days but, oh well, I have another
cool bus. It is now getting a paint job and some restoration that it needed.
