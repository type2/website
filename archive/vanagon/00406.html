Subject: A/C question

Well, the weather is slowly warming up in central Massachusetts and it's
reminding me that I need to get the A/C in my '91 Vanagon working again.
(At the end of last summer, I noticed it was having a harder and harder
time cooling down the interior.) I've been reading that the cost of the
R-12 (Freon/CFC) refrigerant is being manipulated to make its cost rise
dramatically, so I'm dreading the cost of a recharge, which of course is
in addition to the cost of finding and fixing the leak it must have.
Facing this repair bill, I was thinking that this is a good time to find
out if there is an upgrade kit available to switch to the new R-134 (HFC)
refrigerant. So, does anyone know if there is such a conversion kit
available for the waterboxers?
