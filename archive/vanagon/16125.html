Subject: CV Injection Procedure??

Could somebody who's re-greased their CV joints via the big needle-grease
gun method give a detailed rundown of this procedure?

And how does this compare - in terms of results - to a full disassembly,
cleaning and repacking? Am I actually extending the life of the joint by
just squirting some more grease in there?

I have neither the time, nor the workspace to do the full repacking job
myself, and my mechanic would charge me almost 8 hours of labor (yay
Syncro!) to do the full job (might as well just have them all replaced and
be done with it at that rate).

The needle method sounds like just the ticket. I get the piece of mind of
knowing that my joints are lubed and I can do the job myself.

Wishful thinking??
