Subject:      Re: Stuck Door Lock

&gt;
&gt; I unlocked the driver side door with the key, though the lock pull
&gt; didn't return to the full top position before I pulled on the door
&gt; handle.  The result? - one stuck door lock.
&gt;
&gt; I have pulled the door panel back and tried moving things from the
&gt; inside, to no avail, even after gallons of WD-40.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone out there experience a problem like this?  What's the fix.
&gt;



My situation was that the key wouldn't unlock or lock the driver's door.

Easy fix:  took the lock &amp; key to a good locksmith.  $18 later, works
like a charm.
