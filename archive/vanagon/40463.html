Subject: ECU Campaign Details Requested

I found the following information in the archives

&quot;1986 Vanagon  WV***02**GH000001 -  1987/08  PB   Replace Control Unit/
1987 Vanagon  WV***02**HH041180                  Digifant
              includes Syncro. see Campaign details.
              new part: 025-906-022  (yellow dot)&quot;

Is there a place I can receive the entire text of this campaign? It sounds 
like my car fits the bill, and it would sure be nice to have VW subsidize 
my parts aquisition habit for a little while. I called VW of America, and 
they can't seem to find it in their database. Should I be surprized? 

Thanks in advance for any information. Regards, Vance

Please e-mail to J316_at_msg.ti_dot_com.

'86 Westy with dead ECU. Previously owned 411 and '69 bus.
 If I'd known what I know now, I would have pulled the timed heater out of 
the totalled 411 :(
