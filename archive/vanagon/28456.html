Subject:       Re: Stock Aircooled heater fan/Ode to Bently

First, a question:
I'm just curious about this--why dos Bently show a booster fan for 
the defroster in the wiring diagram for my '71 bus?  Was this 
optional equipment or just a little engineering humor?

Second, Bently Rules:
Can we do this?  Can I unabashedly plug a product?  Because I Love 
Bently.  Buy it if you want to do things right.  I love the list for 
the help it gives, and St. Muir for diagnosis and religion, but for 
saving time and doing things right, I love my Bently book.  The price 
is steep for some (Most?) editions,  I've seen the 
price tags for split manuals, and I'm not sure what you  Brickriders 
pay, but for those of us 
blessed with the Bay Window Mystique, It's $33 well spent.  St. Muir 
is great;  the Zen approach to VW work is, next to a 13mm combination 
wrench, the most important tool in my box, but worshipping at his 
altar is only  $8 less than getting 
the '68-'79 Bently last time I looked to purchase (both my idiot books are 
looking a little rough.  One is in a manilla folder, and I just take 
whatever page(s) I need to do a particular job.  Convienent, as long 
as it's not windy).  I tried muddling 
through with Haynes and cross referencing to Muir, ect ect ect.  for 
a while, but now when I need to know ANYTHING, from how westie 
package fits to adjusting torsion bars, I don't have to take the whole 
car apart to figure it out.  I like it.  I love it. I want more of 
it.


Oh well.  If I can't plug, sorry.  I have no ties to Bently, etc, 
etc, etc.  I just want to say that it is an 
extremely useful tool.  The purchase price is high, but the savings 
in time and aggrivation were well worth it to me.  It's nice to be 
able to just look somthing up and do it..   And know that I'm doing 
it right.

One last thing--By looking in Bently, I've been able to find out what 
the flywheel endplay measuring tool looks like, and using aluminum 
bar stock, a vise, a drill, and a hacksaw, fabricate my own.  No mor 
wrench/feeler gague jigs.  Haleluja (or however you spell that)
