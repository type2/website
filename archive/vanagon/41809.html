&gt; 	Someone has offered me a set of 15&quot; chrome wheels that he

&gt; wider than standard Beetle rims, and are apparantly Brazilian. They 
&gt; accept the stock moon hubcaps, and have oval cut-outs around the 
&gt; edges (around the perimeter of the moon hubcaps).  The bolt pattern 
&gt; looks the same as the Bus pattern at casual glance. The owner wants 
&gt; $35 apiece for them, and they are in relatively good shape.

They sound like the standard aftermarket wheels you can get new for 
around $50 or so.  They come in 5.5&quot; and 4.5&quot; widths typically and it 
sounds like these are the 5.5&quot;.  You are luck as the 63's are the first 
year to have the lip on the rear wheel wells as they have more wheel/tire 
clearance for the typical 5.5&quot; wide wheels as you described.  It is a 
tight fit, but I know 165 15's work.  You can go a little wider/bigger, 
but as I say, it gets tight.  Trial and error on *all* clearances is a good 
way to check before running them on the Bus.  BTW, 205/75 15&quot; tires are 
the *very* tight clearance-wise on the 5.5&quot; style wheels.  The price 
seems a bit high for used, maybe you could bargain a bit.  Good luck.
