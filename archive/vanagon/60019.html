well, on the subject of glue i have a recommendation.

available from shoe stores is a brand of contact cement called barge
cement.  This stuff is used to glue rubber to leather, or any two porous
or nonporous surfaces together.  It sticks VERY well.

might be worth considering, it worked great on my rock climbing shoes, but
i cannot give any testimony as to its uses with velcro.

peace,

Steve
