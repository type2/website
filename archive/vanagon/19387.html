Subject: New Buses, Show &amp; Shine


Update on buses bought this week...

Monday	Bought 1964 21 Window Deluxe.  Straight body, needs minor
	floor repair and seal channel at top of front doors.  Complete
	but partially disassembled.  Will probably go straight to the
	body shop.

Tuesday	Bought 1966 non-poptop Westfalia.  Fair shape.  Needs rear
	hatch glass.  Damn yahoos cut rear wheel wells.

Last reminder...

The 3rd Annual Georgia Vintage Volkswagen Show &amp; Shine will be held
THIS SUNDAY at Southern Tech in Marietta, GA.  All air-cooled VW
owners and enthusiasts are welcome to attend.  If you've got a bus
and live within driving distance, you'd better show up.  It is a 
little known fact that all VWs in the southeast that don't attend
will rupture fuel lines, have blocked brake hoses, cracked heads,
burned valves, stuck points, flat tires, bad water pumps (just 
checking to see if you're paying attention), etc if you're not
there to pay homage to the Wolfsburg gods at the lunchtime prayer 
service.

&gt;From I-75 take exit 112 and go west on the south Marietta Lower 120
Loop.  After crossing Hwy 41 Southern Tech will be on the left.

I hope to see you all there.

Dave
