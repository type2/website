Subject: Rare sighting/speed stickers

It may be a common sight in the US, but here in southern England a genuine
Vanagon Westfalia is a rare sight. But, a couple of evenings ago one showed
up, in the local supermarket car park, 'B' reg plate so an 84/85 LHD import,
generally tidy. Most vans say Transporter (or Caravelle for the people mover
version), first one I've seen that I've seen one with a Vanagon label.
Didn't have time for a real good look.

As for speed limit stickers, a truck passing through several countries will
need the relevant sticker for each country. So it could have several, with a
mixture of MPH and KPH - just to confuse you. 

Regards,
