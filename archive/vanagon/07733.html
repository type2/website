Subject: Re: Should I buy a '70 single cab with a blown engine for $1200?

&gt;&gt;I'm MIGHTILY tempted by this single-cab.

I would be too...  What's everything like other than the
engine?

Is it anywhere near Iowa?  (Just in case you don't go for it...)

Seriously, I'd probably do it, although as a matter of course
I'd dicker with the owner on price.
