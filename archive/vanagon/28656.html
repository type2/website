Subject: RE: 71 Bus ignition switch

Steve,

I did this and it is tough, the books say there is a spring (there is ) 
 and that you can fish a wire into the mechanism and release it and the 
 core will come out (you cant). I ended up pulling the column mount 
 with the switch in it and thene carefully grinding away the outer 
 portion until the whole assembly could be removed. I then could reach 
 the leaf spring and remove the cylinder. I have heard that you can 
 drill a hole through the mounting bracket and reach the release spring 
 but you would have to know exactly where to drill.

Good Luck 
Clay


&gt;Anybody replaced an ignition switch on an '71 Transporter recently?
&gt;This one seems different from the switch on my old '69 bus. the '71
&gt;needs only half a turn to go from &quot;running&quot; to &quot;steering locked&quot;,
&gt;while the '69 needed either 3/4 turn or 1 full turn (can't remember--
&gt;it was a long time ago!)

&gt;My questions are:

&gt;1.) Are there any unusual hassles involved in the replacement?

&gt;2.) Anyone got a working used one they wouldn't mind $selling?
