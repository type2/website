Subject: Syncro Air Filter CDN $$$

Hi Everyone.  I bought a Syncro air filter off Kyle a few weeks ago, 
and it arrived with all charges (exchange, shipping, duty, pst, gst, 
customs handling charge) for a total cost of $47.14 CDN.

I contacted my dealer today and asked him how much this filter is 
worth (costs) today..... $156.00 CDN.

Hmmm ...  a little math here indicates that I saved a MAJOR pile of 
dough :)  Now, I'm still running on the same filter since 1993 in 
which I drove across Canada, etc.  This filter is STILL clean and in 
excellent shape.  The Syncro's dirt trap prior to filter helps to 
keep that dirt out of the filter.

Thanks, Kyle, for making this available to us!

Harry.
