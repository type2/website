I'm thinking about replacing a leaking head bolt. Is there anything to this 
process other than removing the old bolt and replacing it with a new bolt 
that is sealed with the Bolt Prep stuff, and torquing it to spec? Do I have 
to loosen all of the head bolts and retorque in sequence? Anything else I 
should know?

The bolt in question is on the upper right side of the passenger-side head 
of a 2.1l engine.
