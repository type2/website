&gt;How the hell do you remove the V-gon Pwr. Mirrors????
&gt;I took off the glass, and that little motor, I took off the doorpanel, and
&gt;unplugged the wire connection, But The stupid wire connectors won't fit thru
&gt;that little hole in the door!!
&gt;I tried to pull the wires out of the plastic wire connector but no-go.
&gt;Grrrr.....I'm ready to cut the wires........  :&lt;(

now, now ... there is a trick to it. look on the backside (where the wires
come out) of the plastic connector. there is a little &quot;clip&quot; sticking down
out of the plastic &quot;hole&quot;, and this clip is grabbed by a little metal &quot;tang&quot;
that sticks up from the metal connector (the part that is crimped onto the
wires).

what you have to do is still something small and long and hard/sharp into the
hole in the plastic connector, and pry the &quot;tang&quot; away from the &quot;clip&quot; ...
this lets you pull the metal connector out of the plastic connector.

then you can feed the wires/metal connectors through the hole in the door,
one by one. yeah, it's a bitch, but that's the only way, short of cutting
the wires. :(

and you'll have to pry the &quot;tang&quot; back up a little bit when you put the
metal connectors back into the plastic connector (otherwise it won't latch
with the &quot;clip&quot;).

good lucl.
