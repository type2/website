Subject: ccc's peppermint this weekend!


Time is drawing nigh.  Here's the list of victims...er, I mean, attendees
for this weekend (Feb. 23-25th) at Peppermint (north of Lake Isabella).

(I realize that a few of you are still &quot;maybe&quot; but thought I'd include
you just in case....)

If we can believe David Schwarze, bring hiking boots!  More on
other packing items later.  

So far, we have one person bringing dolmas, and another brining
chicken and dumplings.  Please sign up.  I think Stafford will grace
us with his spectacular homebrew again.  

As a reminder, dinners are potluck, as are breakfasts. Lunches are
do-yer-own, and we may want to pack lunch stuff to pack for hiking
to the ranger lookout Dave suggested.  

Dress WARM - Dave (or someone) should know by tomorrow if this place
should be open (hope it won't be closed from snow, but stay tuned
until the last minute just in case).  Bring heaters (no AC, I think,
though).

Bring firewood as if your life depended on it.  It may.  :)  We will
be using the fire this time not only to hallucinate, but may actually
need it to stay warm for once.  

Also bring weird stuff to burn.  Does ANYONE out there please have
a Barbie Doll they wouldn't mind sacrificing?  Don't ask - you can
wittness it first hand, or read about it vicariously in the trip
review.  I plan to burn some REALLY foul limburger-type cheese left
over at my house from the last party here, and will bring along Nikki
Kautz's neck brace - the one he had to wear for 6 whole weeks non-stop
right next to his body while his broken collarbone was healing.  He
offered it to our &quot;cause.&quot;

Also, bring whatever you drink, plus ice.  Will try to do a more
detailed packing list, as I say, as time gets closer.

Keep watchin'...
