Where ya at?  :)

&gt; I am looking at about $700 to $800 to get it running smoothly and smog it.  
&gt; This price I give as it was explained to me: that much money to get the fuel
&gt; injection system fixed.  The body is straight and clean with the typical late
&gt; model surface rust on the top.  The inside is clean too.

I have been stock piling FI parts. :)  I think I have two '76 CA ECUs, part 
number 022 906 021 S.  If you're local (Bay Area) I'll help ya out...
one way or another. :)

Also... if anyone wants to trade a '76 ECU for a '77... write me.

Bradley
