Subject: Dave Black! Jim Brill! Westy parts catalog cometh!

I need Dave Black and Jim Brill's snail-mail addresses.  I have pat 
Walsh's and ROn Van Ness's.  Need Michael Heron's, too.  Sorry.

Anyone have info on the Franklin Mint microbus deluxe?  I heard about it 
on r.a.vw but nothing concrete. Now the latest DB&amp;HVWs mentions it.

&gt;From DBHVWs classifieds:
 
 1968 - 79 Westphailia Tent new, $600.  (516) 221-4083

 1966 Westfalia with rare side awning.  Daily driver, rebuilt motor and 
brakes, 12, NEW Michelins, child's cot, MINT interior! Drive home today.  
Sacrifice, $4,500! Scott Gaillard, 2211 Welcome, Williamston, SC 29697, 
(803) 261-7105.

 [IMO the &quot;rare&quot; awning dowsn't look factory.]

Tell 'em you saw it on the 'net!

Joe
