Subject: Need help with propane valve
Date: Wed, 8 Jan 1997 19:58:40 -0500

Hey all,
I've been trying for a while and despite John Anderson being good enough to
explain it to me slowly so I'll understand ;) I still can't get the valve
apart on the propane tank of my '81 Westy.  So if anyone has any ideas,
please please let me know.  The problem is that the on/off valve on the
tank is leaking.  It seems to be leaking past the seals in the valve.  I've
been trying to get the valve apart so I can rebuild it.  I managed to get
the screw out of the middle of the knob, but I can't get any farther than
that.  That knob just will not pull off.  Behind the knob is what looks
like two nuts run together but I can't tell if it's just a big single nut
or two separate nuts.  I figure if I can get the nut(s) off I can withdraw
the valve but I can't get those suckers to budge at all.  This is getting
really frustrating.  Should I just take the thing to an RV place and have
them do it or what?  

Thanks,
Sean
