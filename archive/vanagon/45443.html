Subject: Ratios:RPM/Speed('81 Westy)

Hi all....

Please note the anal-retentive/politically correct subject line!  ;&gt;

The query I have for yous all is simple:  In an '81 Vanagon, what is the RPM at 
each marking on the speedo in each gear?

Also:  My tranny sound/feels good in all forward gears, but when I let the van 
roll backwards while in reverse, or if I go backwards under power, there is a 
terrible rumble/growl/grinding sound and feeling...anyone know what this might 
be?

Too dul oo
