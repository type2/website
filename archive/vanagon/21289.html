Subject: Help locate 93 or 94 Eurovan
Date: 	Fri, 21 Jul 1995 04:09:48 -0400

A friend of mine is looking for a 1993 or 1994 EuroVan to replace his
1987 Camper.  He was told by VW Dealers, here in Ontario, that this model
is not imported to Canada, so he decided to look for one in the US.  Not
much luck so far. He contacted many VW Dealers in the US.  They didn't
have any available.

If you know os somebody selling his EuroVan or have any helpful information
of how to find one, anywhere in the US, send mail directly to me at:

Your help is greately appreciated.

Avo
