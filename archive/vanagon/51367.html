Subject: Re: Start &amp; Go (or no quick escape!)

I have a 1980 fuel injected Westfalia that does the same thing!  Does anyone
out there have any ideas on this problem?  I would sure like to get it to
idle better on cold starts and after short periods of rest.

Thanks for any help you can give.

&gt;Thanks to everyone-trip in our &quot;new&quot; '85 Westy a big success.  Also cudos 
&gt;to my VW mechanic who is really a race boat mechanic!
&gt;Now to another problem:  Cold start, hard to get to idle on its own until 
&gt;about 30 seconds.  No matter what you do, you can't put it into gear and 
&gt;leave.  Ususlly you have to stall at least twice and restart, no trouble 
&gt;starting.  I notice this will also happen on a hot start like after going 
&gt;in for that quick cup of morning coffee on the road.  Could this be a 
&gt;fuel pump problem?  Seems like if you let it set for more than about 5 
&gt;minutes you have the problem-like when you are gassing up.  Any ideas?
