Subject: Re: electrical/convenience stuff (solar)

An informed discussion and/or pointers to 12v solar panel stuff would
be interesting.  Now that summer is here I'd love to implement a solar
powered ventilation system.  Anyone seen such?

- Frank

 &gt;I recently got an Adventurewagen, and compared to a westy it is a little
 &gt;sparse on the conveniences.  I think i would like to install a deep cycle
 &gt;battery to power one of those electric cooler things (and other stuff),
 &gt;and possibly charge the battery with a solar panel.  I have little
 &gt;knowledge of electrical systems (other than what I learned in an EE
 &gt;class long ago) and wondering if ther is a good resource book about
 &gt;12V systems to get me up to speed.  I'm also wondering if anyone has
 &gt;ever used one of those cooler things, and if there may be another
 &gt;alternative (other than ice) for keeping my food and beverages cold on
 &gt;trips. I have access to westy conveniences (sink, stove, fridge,cabinets)
 &gt;from an 83, but I am thinking that trying to put them into my van may be
 &gt;more than I can handle.  If it is easier than it seems, please let me know.
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks,
