Hi all,
	The response to my earlier post was greater than I anticipated.
The first four people that mailed me have had cards sent in their behalf,
but for the other 15 or so I am going to have to go through some of my older
catalogs to find more cards.   This is great, though!  If JC Whitney knows
that there are lots of type II owners reading their catalogs, maybe they
will go to more trouble to get parts!
