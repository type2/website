&gt; So how do the rest of you folks winterize your westie?  
&gt; I've seen foam window covers, propane catalytics, micro forced air furnaces,
&gt; lots of dogs and other schemes for winter camping.  I'm thinking of a ski
&gt; excursion with the syncro as bed and breakfast in such chilly places as
&gt; Sun Valley ID, Jackson WY, McCall ID, Bozeman MT, Driggs ID, etc etc.  So 
&gt; what's the recommendations for winter camping from some of you Westphilias that
&gt; have done such bold adventures and lived to write me about it?

a realy good, no, an excelent sleeping bag for the cold, and some kind of 
heater you can reach out and start quickly with one hand 20 minutes before 
getting out of the bag.
