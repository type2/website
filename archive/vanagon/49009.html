Subject: Early1969 Westfalia interior into a 1961 split?

I've got a simple question.
Will a westly interior for 68 or 69 fit into a 1961 split? Is the interior
volume of the later bay window larger then the earlier vans? The reason I'm
asking is that I was offered a full interior at a good price. If it'll fit
I'll go for it, but I don't want to mess with to many refabrications. If
that is to be the case, I'll hold out a little longer until a correct
period piece shows up.
