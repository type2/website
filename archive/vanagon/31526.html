Subject: Re: Jerque du Jour


&gt;Just saw CNN's Computer Connection featuring the Highway 17 Jerque du
&gt;Jour page.  Stated that common targets are &quot;slow poke VW Busses'.  Gotta'
&gt;love it.  Showed a nice maroon-colored mid-70's Bus.  Anybody want to
&gt;claim it?


Wasn't me. But I may go up there and cruise that freeway at 30 mph till
I get my 15 minutes of fame!   :^)
