&gt;The water pump is on the left side of the engine, so a leak on the

&gt;where it attaches to the head.  And people talk about good German engineering!
&gt;I know -- Lucas musta designed this for them (I know, we aren't supposed
&gt;to dis Lucas...).  OK.  There is this pipe, attached to the rear of the
&gt;right side of the engine, and it's plastic, and it ain't worth crap, and it
&gt;probably cracked or warped in the cold.  Check this first -- you might be
&gt;lucky and find this has failed.  It's a simple part to fix -- I think its
&gt;replacement might be metal.  I fixed mine temporarily with RTV and a prayer,
&gt;and it seems fine after 10,000 miles, but it only means that it still is
&gt;about to fail...  I'll fix it proper someday.

The plastic coolant flange on the right cylinder head has been replaced by
(metal) part # 025 121 160 D; be sure to also replace the gasket, 
part # N 901 685 01
