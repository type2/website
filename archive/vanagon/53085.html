&gt; Hi, tony----- I can't send postings to the list.  Well, actually , I can
but
&gt; they are being delayed by A WHOLE DAY!!!!!   So That's the reason for all
those
&gt; repetitive posts about the sunroof.  I thought it wasn't being sent, so I
kept
&gt; re-sending it, because I did not see it coming up on the list.  That
message
&gt; about the '88 van for sale by someone that asked me to post it for
them--- I
&gt; sent that last night-------and it didn't show up on the list till 24 hrs
&gt; later!!!
&gt; 
&gt; will you please do a favor for me and explain to all the listmembers that
I am
&gt; having a 24 hr delay from between the time I post, and the time it shows
on the
&gt; list??
&gt; 
&gt; I could post an apology, but it would not show up until Sat morning at
the rate
&gt; things are going.  Why is it doing this??   Any ideas????
&gt; 
&gt; thanks 
&gt; 
&gt; chris
