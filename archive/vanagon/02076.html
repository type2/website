&gt;Joel's list only lists 6 people in PA.  Yet, I think we definitely
&gt;have more bricks around here.  I guess they just do not have access to e-mail.
&gt;I would suggest that we could ask the dealers and VW mechanics to put signs
&gt;up related to the tour once we know the details......

oh,yes, but only those 6 are subscribed to the Vanagon list (that i know of,
that is ... there are likely some of the lurkers/no-bus/no-locations who are
in PA).

AND ... if this Great Mass of Foolishness ever really gets rolling, what if
the NEAT, SOTO, and LiMBO bunches (who likely don't have computer access)
got involved in the act? well, here are the 'clubs' that i know about:

E0G 1Z0  CANADA

and, as a parting thought, this talk about WHEN (early May, academic schedule
and etcetera), has anyone thought that this thing, once started, will take
a finite amount of TIME to complete? as in, starts in one place at such-and-
such a time, but continues for the whole summer as it winds its way around?
it would likely require a while (driving, camping, whatever) just to go
from SCA to NCA (that's Souther california to Northern california). the
point being that (1) maybe it wouldn't get to your area until you did have
the time or (2) a smaller amount of time could be taken off from work to
'catch up' as they passed through your area. :)  or something like that.
well, it SEEMED like a complete rational thought when i started typing it!
