Subject: 1971 Pulley  &quot;Hot&quot;

The generator pulley is getting very hot. Just replaced the fan belt and
the belt is on the loose side not the tight side. The outside pulley half
seems to have a slight groove worn into it that might be affecting the
way the belt fits in the groove. Can't adjust it any looser and have it
stay on. The pulley gets too hot to touch after running just a few
minutes. Any other ideas? Thanks for the help in advance.
