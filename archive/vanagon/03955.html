Greetings from NJ, PA, NY, MA, NH, VT and Quebec!

Anthony and I just returned from 13 days (1553 miles) and 2 VW shows
in our 1967 Westy camper - had a great time! If anyone was looking
for me, that's why I didn't respond to your e-mail (yet).  

Joel, I'm not on your list of unknowns but here are the buses we have at
home:

1967 Westphalia camper 
1967 non-sunroof deluxe
1966 sunroof deluxe (21-window)
1966 crew cab
1962 crew cab

There's also a bubble bus (70 or 71, I think - I'll check later with
Anthony).
 
Also, 5 bugs at home - I think 3 66's and a couple more.

More later - have to get to a meeting! It's great to be back (on the
vanagon list, if not at work).

Lori &amp; Anthony
