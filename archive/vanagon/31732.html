&gt; Whats the difference between a 25hp motor and a 36hp motor?
&gt; I mean besides the (duh) hp rating &amp; displacement.  
&gt; 
&gt; And is that bhp or SAE?
&gt; 
&gt; Is is something you can detect with the naked (!) eye?
&gt; 

I was reading just this morning about 25hp motors.  They
were refered to as &quot;bhp&quot; and a characteristic was that the
generator pedestal was cast as part of the case.  

&gt; How hard is it to get parts for one of these beauties?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess its obvious that I'm looking to add a vehicle with
&gt; this tremendous amount of horsepower to my stable...  Details
&gt; when I get the deal gelled...

Good luck!
