Subject: Clutch Cable Replacement??
Date: Mon, 21 Nov 94 10:07:01 PST

What Fun!!!

Yesterday my clutch cable seperated on my 72 bus - 8(

So, tell me...How do you replace one of these things? I have done it
in a bug (had to remove the pedal assembly..) I know what it loos like
on the rear, what about the front? What needs to be taken off?

Any and all help greatly appreciated!

Regards,
