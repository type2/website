Hi

Thanks to all who gave advice on the possible purchase of a bus a week
or so ago.
I haven't even purchased my first bus yet.  With the help of this list
and archives, etc... , I now have an idea of what I want and what to
look for.
Thanks for letting me lurk and answering my newbie questions.
The inclusion of the Muir book to my bookcase has been great.
I just know I'll be drunk, hosting a party sometime and telling
someone I barely know that I love them and they should read that book
as it changed my life. :-)
Relocating back to NY and probably no internet access for a while.
But, I will return... oh yes, I will return.  And I shall be riding a
gleaming bus!

Thanks for listening, as they say.
Mike
