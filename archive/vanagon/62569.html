Subject: help on gas fridge problem

Hi Y'all!  Any Dometic Fridge repair help out there?   Here's the problem....
My 182B Dometic runs great on AC, DC, and starts okay on propane.  But on
propane, it doesn't get very cold.  on AC and DC, it freezes ice in about 2
hours.. No Way on propane.... 

I've changed the thermostat,  cleaned the burner jet, air intake and exhuast
tubes, and burner assembly housing.   I've put on a new propane regulator and
had it calibrated at 11 lbs per the manual.  I've checked for any leaks, and
there aren't any..    On my other van,  the fridge works great on all
functions, and when on propane,  I can hear a loud rumble of the burner
assembly through the flue vent..  On this puppy,  I can hear a faint rumble,
like it's not going to high flame.... What to do?  When in a remote area for
long stay,  you need propane operation to work correctly.   I've also talked
to the tech guys at Dometic in Indiana,  but they don't seem any more helpful
than the owner's manual,  and every suggestion they made,  I did as above.
  I think I need the real Zen Master of Dometic Fridge Karma to help me......
Thanks for any replies...
