I went through this problem already with my '92 Passat.  Turned out it 
was a wheel weight left in my tire after having a flat fixed.  I only 
heard the tick, tick sound at certain slow speeds.  If it was too slow, 
the wheel weight would just slide along the bottom of the tire making no 
noise at all, too fast and the centrifigal force would keep the weight 
stationary.

I thought I would be looking at an expensive bearing repair.  Maybe there 
is a god.  Although I wonder if this was some technician's idea of a 
cruel joke.  You know what they say: &quot;Even paranoids have enemies.&quot;
