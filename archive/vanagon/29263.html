Subject: Long Lost Bus Has New Home

I *finally* fetched the '69 Sunroof Bus from its old home (where I bought 
it two years ago) and delivered it to a buddy whose very nice '70 Bus 
died in a fire a few weeks ago.  He was very happy to have this Bus 
(which has NO RUST) as his new project.  He will give it a better home 
than I would have.  If you ever get a chance to see a Bus after a major 
fire ... don't.  Oh, and Joel, delete the '69 from my stats.  Thanks.
