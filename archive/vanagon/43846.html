Subject: Type 2 Engine Mount

&gt;several of these things used with no apparent ill effects. But some older
&gt;engines (maybe 1300cc and smaller?) had 6mm studs holding the oil pump
&gt;cover on instead of the stronger 8mm studs used in later engines. I'm

        Uhh, correct me if I'm wrong here-the rear busmount was used on
'68-'71 models, right? And these models came with respectively, '68-'70
1600SP and '71 1600DP, right? So who in thier right mind would put a 1300
in thier '68-'71??? Just a thought...   ;-) Although if some masachist
*really* wanted a 1300 in his breadloaf, who am I to say no?  ;-)

Peace,
