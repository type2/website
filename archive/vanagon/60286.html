Subject: Syncro in York, PA

My apologies to everyone wanting information on this Vanagon.  I stopped
in to see it Saturday afternoon about two and there wasn't a soul
around.   I was going to stop in on my way back to MD on Monday but, the
Vanagon was not there.  I don't know if it's sold or not.
	Chances are that it is not sold and will not be sold at the $6000
asking price.  The body is in good shape.  The engine may be a little
tired.  The oil doesn't smell good and is quite thin.  The coolant
resevoir was dry.  These signs do not bode well for the heads.
	There are a couple of small dings in the doors and a very strange worn
mark on the front.  The undercarriage looks good and rust free.  The
interior is a little dirty and used but, in great shape for a ten year
old car with 103,000 miles on it.
	I'm sorry I didn't get to check out the engine or take it for a drive. 
I won't be in PA for a couple of weeks to try again.  Maybe one of the
York locals on the list could check it out.

	Be cautious of this one.
