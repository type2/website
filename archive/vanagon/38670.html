Subject: '88 Fuel line size

After tracing all the lines, I finally found the source of gas small 
on my '88 - the hose from fuel pump to filter.

During my inspection of the myriad of fuel lines around the engine, 
I'm now wondering if I should replace them all...

Can someone tell me what the inside diameter is on the fuel pump to 
filter hose? I have some 1/4&quot;, but didn't want to take it off unless 
I had the right size. Also, is the size the same for all the fuel 
lines to injectors &amp; stuff? If so, can I just buy a few feet of it 
(and a ton of new clamps) &amp; have at 'er? 

Thanks!
