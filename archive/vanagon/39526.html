Subject: 78 Engine Rebuild Fragen

Well, I'm to the point in my  engine rebuild (heads mainly, rebuilt by Mark
Stepehens due to list recommendations) where it's out of the bus and pretty
much stripped to the longblock. I'm very glad that I'm undertaking this
myself as there is so much labor intensive cleanup involved I could have
never gotten a decent job done by a shop, cheaply that is!

I'm definitely in need of some parts for the engine and was wondering what
some good companies are that have good catalogues. I plan on upgrading to
at least a 70Amp Alternator, new exhaust, probably just have the heat
exchangers cleaned (man they're expensive new!). So any suggestions for
companies servicing busses would be greatly appreciated!

&quot;Who are You?&quot;
&quot;I'm fine thanks, who are you?&quot;
&quot;I'm fine too, but you no get in without the password&quot;
