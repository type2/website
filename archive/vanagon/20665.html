&gt; I know this sounds anal, but here goes.  Yesterday I added Dura Lube

&gt; odor.  

If you are convinced that it is you causing the odor, rather than the VW,
I would suggest modifying your dietary intake before trying to fix the 
problem by hacking up the van.  You are right, the problem sounds anal.
