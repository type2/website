    I had the same problem in my bus. The relay used by VW for the 
    indicators/hazard lights was changed around 71/72ish ( I don't
    know exactly when), but the following is only correct for the
    earlier type relay.

    The black `thing' plugged into your fuse box actually contains 
    two small relays and a few components. (Careful here, the cover
    isn't designed to be removable). In my case I plugged the coverless
    board back in to the fuse box, and watched it whilst the indicators were 
    blinking. After a few seconds one relay stopped clicking and so did 
    the dash light.

    I tried to get another complete relay box, but the early ones are a 
    stupid price at the dealers and so far I haven't found a working one 
    at a scrap yard. In the end I soldered a link between the two relays 
    and that solved the problem for me, but obviously this is a bit of
    a bodge I not really to be recommended. If your problem is the relay, 
    getting a new/replacement one is a far better solution.

    Good luck,
