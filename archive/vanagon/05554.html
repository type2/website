Thanks to everyone who's commented on non-westy campers.  It seems
that pop-top is most useful for storing the kids at night, and for
ventilation during the warmer months, and giving some headroom
while parked.

I'll probably go and visit Country Homes Campers south of here, and
see what kind of prices they have.  A lot of the mini-mini vans 
(like the little Toyotas and Mitsubishis) have camper tops done by 
Country Homes, as do lots of Vanagons and EVs.

Thanks again for everyone's help!

-Jim
