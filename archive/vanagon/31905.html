Subject:  heaters and propane

Volks,
	I've been wanting to install a vented propane heater in my bus for
some time.  One thing I am wondering about though.  Those of you that
have installed them, are you using the stock propane tank?  The little
dinky one?  My '73 Safare has a slightly larger tank than the Westy (3
gallons) but I don't think I could get more than two nights worth of
heat out of it.  If I'm camping in the snow in the boonies for a week,

I have a 6000 BTU vented heater installed which seems to be more than enough to
keep us warm on ski trips.  At this output rating a gallon of LP will provide 17
hours of continuous heating.  Since we don't really run it during the day, our
capacity for 51 hours of heat generally gives us about a week's worth of heat.
If we want more, I have a quick connect hose fitted to the heater that lets me
plug in a portable 5 gallon tank.

Enjoy.
