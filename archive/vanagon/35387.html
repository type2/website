turning Kombis into 21 window lookalikes....there's a big VW event on Sunday
over here...will post anything interesting, practical etc that doesn't repeat
anything else that might get posted meanwhiles.....Me? Well I just pay
someone...! Or else I just dream about what would be nice to do if I had the
skill, the tools, the know how, the time....
