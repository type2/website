G'day Jack,
When I was serving my apprenticeship I saw a Stellite drill being used for
just this sort of thing.  I would depend how big the stud is and how small
a drill you can get.  I've no idea where to go to get one of these things
as I havn't been in the trade for 20 years.
P.S. I might have spelled the name wrong but that was the name it had.  It
is triangular in shape with a triangular pyramid at the end with a notch
in each of the base corners.  Further up the shaft is round.
I hope that helps.
Reece.
