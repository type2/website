In some of the larger villages there is an EPA enforced  regulation that
fossil fuels must be oxygenated during the colder winter months in order
to reduce emissions. These fuels are more expensive and reduce mpg...but
the significant decline in 03, NOx, CO, etc. raises the benefit:cost
ratio, IMHO. 
Or it may be the lunar harmonic convergance that gave you better gas
mileage...
