Subject: adapting '88 Volvo 240 seats to bus
Date: Thu, 8 Dec 1994 22:01:32 -0600 (CST)

&gt;i'd be interested in hearing how you installed the volvo seats, if you
&gt;don't mind elaborating
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;&quot;duct tape- is there anything it can't do?&quot;

No trouble! Here you go:

Before you decide to use Volvo seats, I suggest you look at the
alternatives.  Usually seats from sports cars are flatter and smaller and
therefore would fit better. Measure height, depth, width, etc. of your VW
seats and then compare. The junkyard had one seat from a Civic CRX which
looked like a nice fit, but I wanted 2, plus I wanted heated seats because
I figured it would be a nice compensation for the deficient heating in the
winter. 

Removing the seats from the Volvo is straightforward: only 4 bolts for
each seat. Keep the bolts/nuts, you may need them later. Also, the seats
are probably heated (don't mention this to the junkyard boys or they'll
charge you extra for having a fancy butt), so make sure to take all the
wiring and switches, too. The switches are located between the seats by
the parking brake; the wiring goes back under the carpet all the way up to
the dash.  Take it all. 

Back at home, remove the sliding mechanisms from both seats. That will
remove at least one inch of height. Now you'll notice that the driver's
seat differs from the passenger's seat in that it can be adjusted up and
downwards. I suggest you install the non-adjustable seat first because
it's easier. Note that you can make it your new driver's seat if you want
(I didn't because I didn't think of it). 

Non-adjustable (passenger) seat: you will notice that the distance between
the left and the right track is only barely large enough to bridge the
depression between the wheel well and the little storage compartment where
most people keep their Bilstein jacks. So unbolt the tracks and reattach
them inside out. A frontal view of the seat without tracks would be: 

			_at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_
			 |	 |

whereas the tracks would be:  |_  and  _|

Before, we have: 	_at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_ 
			 ||_   _||

and after:		_at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_
		       _||       ||_

You'll know what I mean once you get there.:)

Now place the seat in its destined position, sit in it, adjust the
recliner, etc., and carefully determine where you want to drill the 4
holes. The nuts and bolt that were left after you removed the sliding
mechanisms are perfect, but you'll have to add some solid washers. Drill
the 4 holes, 2 into the wheel well (don't perforate your tire :)) and 2
into the storage compartment. Remove the metal shavings and treat/paint to
prevent rust. Bolt the seat in and you're done. You can also put some
silicone gel on the washer to help keep water out. 

Test it and see if you like it. You're now sitting 1 or 2&quot; (2.5 or 5 cm)
higher up, so if you're short, you may have trouble touching the floor
with your feet. I'm just 5'10&quot; (176 cm) and I'm fine. If it's acceptable,
install the other seat. If not, take the seats back to the junkyard and
pay the restocking fee. 

Adjustable (driver's) seat: the problem here is that the 2 tracks are
integral parts of one large piece, so you can't do the same inside out
switching.  However, the distance between both tracks is sufficient,
though barely, so you'll just have to position the seat carefully. Before
you do this, though, remove the base of the height adjuster and rotate it
180 degrees back to front (no bolts here). This will move the tracks about
6 inches (15cm) to the back and make the bolting in much easier. Again,
spend a lot of time getting the seat in the right position by sitting in
it and making sure you're comfortable. If you're not, this is the time to
stop and put the old seat back in. Large people might find that there is
not enough clearance between the seat and the steering wheel. By the way,
there is no need to remove or alter the original VW sliding mechanism
except for drilled holes, hence you can always revert to stock -- but why? 

And the butt-heater switches can be set in a face plate attached to the
dash board where once there used to be the ash-tray I no longer use.
That's also were I put the knob to balance front to back speakers as well
as an on-off-on switch to choose whether the head temperature gauge should
be connected to the thermo sender on cylinder #3 (left head) or the one on
cylinder #1 (right head). 

Good luck! If you need clarifications, send me an e-mail or give me a call
at (314) 935-7472.
