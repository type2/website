Subject: Re: Some mechanics belong in the penitentiary [here's my
  longish              rant]

  This is a very interesting topic,

  I work in a VW shop in Santa Cruz Cal.  We have been doing a very high
volume of service for the last 7+ years.  We have become the shop to take
your car to in our area:)  It's very hard to keep up with the pace sometimes
due to the # of people wanting to have us work on their VW's.  We're in a
process of change right now, and over the next 6 months or so we may even be
looking for a Air-Cooled tech.  

  I'm writing this on the topic though, and that is that you can often tell
who the rip-offs are, and in our business I've sen more than my share of
repair orders from other shops with &quot;Extremly High &quot; charges for simple tasks.

  I hate to see people being Ripped Off!  We at Volks Cafe have a different
theory, if the customer has been taken care of Correctly, ie not ripped off.
Needs and wants attended too.  They'll be back, they in turn will tell 4-6
of their friends (VW owners or not) and so on and so on.  This has brought
our little shop (14 Employees) to the #1 voted &quot;Best foreign car repair shop
&quot; in our area.  I'm not writing this to brag, but to let the consumer know
that there are shops that are still doing an honest business.  I've found
that I ask a person from out of town &quot;who do you have service your VW?&quot;  Are
you happy with the service?  ETC, this give s me an idea of who is doing
Quality work in other area so I can possibly point someone else to those
people that may be from that same area.

  I love the Type 2 list and the V_at_L list.  The info sharing etc is the best
way for people that don't have shops like ours or a Tech acrross the
street(KEN) to go and ask.  I too have nieghbors, and I work on their cars
too.  It's always been that way for me, and in fact II learn more about
other types of cars that way too.  I still prefer to work on VW's though.

  Ken I hope you like hundai's, I know that I don't personally work on them:)
