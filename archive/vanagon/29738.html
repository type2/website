Most likely, you were talking to someone that works for Neodata,
either in Longmont or Boulder Colorado.  Neodata is a very large
magazine subscription service, which handles subscription maintenance
for a *lot* of magazines.  You wouldn't believe the number of phone
lines each of their buildings has....

There are a few other subscription services around the country, whose
names I'm not familiar with.  Basically, when you do anything
involving multiple subscriptions, there's a good chance you'll be
dealing with the same service for all of them.  It *is* a little
surprising that you got the same person twice in a row, though.
