Subject: Subscription info for various VW-related lists please


A fellow on the net happened upon the Vanagon server here at Automatrix and
noticed that I talked about the mailing list but neglected to provide
subscription info, so I'm adding that.  I've got this list's subscription
info (listproc_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with a body of &quot;subscribe vanagon First
Last&quot;, right?).

There is a Vintage VW mailing list.  Is it active?  Anybody know the
subscription info for it?  I tried contacting the Web server at Simon Fraser
just now but couldn't make a connection.

Also, I know the gopher server at lenti is unavailable at the moment, but
what's it usual URL?

Thanks,
