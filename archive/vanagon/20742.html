&gt; &gt;Are there other people, like myself, who remember peoples' Bus-names
&gt; &gt;but not the peoples' names? I will use as an example, &quot;Das Boot&quot; and
&gt; &gt;&quot;Bozo Bus&quot;.
&gt; &gt;It would help *me* a great deal if we could get a mapping of vehicle
&gt; &gt;names to people names...Does anybody else feel this way?
&gt; 
&gt; AARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! not the &quot;let's keep Joel busy&quot;
&gt; thread again!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; oh, sure, YOU don't care about MY problems!!!! it's only diskspace, after all,
&gt; right!!! :)
&gt; 
I for one, have resisted naming our Vanagon because family history has 
proven unkind to this type of tradition. I once had a '78 Jeep Cherokee 
that I happily named JP on the day I bought it and happily got it stuck 
in a snowbank (first 4x4 and all that). Two weeks later a rod bearing 
piggybacked and chewed up the lower end (360 V8). Cost to fix? $900+, and 
me a poor college student.

This also applies to any vehicle described by a family member as cute, ie 
'75 Chevy Monza (my mom's) and '78 Renault LeCar (&quot;Gosh, that's a big oil 
puddle&quot; and &quot;The engine's in backwards so the front seal that is leaking 
is really in the back and BTW that'll be $400...if I can find the parts&quot;)

So, the Vanagon is simply &quot;the van&quot;, or when it needs work &quot;_My_Wife's_Van_&quot;
and the Rabbit is simply &quot;my car&quot; or &quot;_My_$#%&amp;*_Car_&quot;.

Sorry, no cutesie names here.
