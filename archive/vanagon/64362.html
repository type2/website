Subject:      88 Vanagon air flow meter question

I think that the cause of some early morning hesitation and stalling at
idle may be due to the age and condition of my air flow control box.  I had
a 1980 model with a similar box and the black plastic cover on top, would
just pop off.  Mine appears to be glued on.  Does this indicate work by the
PO or the PO's repair shop?  Should that black plastic cover be removable
so that I can check out the resistor and wiper arm that hide inside?
