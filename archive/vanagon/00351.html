	Just recently I lost a valvu seat on the #2 intake.  I ended up
reaplcing the engine with a 2000 FI and now I have lot of good parts if
anyone is interested
	
	Crank , still pretty good
	1 head
	Good case align bored about 5k ago.
	Clutch plate and pressure plate, both have about 5K on them
	3 pistons and cylinders,  honed 5K ago.
	4 new rods with 5K, again
	Fan housing with good altenator
	Good tranny, rebuilt 15K ago by Peek performance, in DC.
	And various other little engine things I can't rember

	If anyone is interested give me a yell
