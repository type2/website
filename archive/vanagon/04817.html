Subject: Hydraulic Press For Vanagon

Many operations in the Vanagon repair manual seem to involve use of a heavy
duty shop press. I see that there are many of these available cheaply in the
throw away used-merchandise-for-sale catalogs around here but I don't know
what size to buy. I see that a recent Harbor Freight catalog has 6, 12, 20,
and 30 ton presses.

Anyone know what the largest size you are likely to need to do all the
operations on the Vanagon? 

Anyone have their own shop press?
