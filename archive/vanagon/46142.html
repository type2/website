&gt; &gt; Need Help,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have an '85 Vanagon and the lifters occasionally stick at start-up.
&gt; &gt;  Typically they will free up before you get out of the driveway. 
Today,
&gt; &gt; however, one stuck and did not free up for several miles.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have two questions.  First, can this damage my engine?  And second,
is
&gt; &gt; there anything I can do to prevent them from sticking?  
&gt; My '88 did this almost every day until I switched to synthetic oil 
&gt; (Mobil 1 15w50) after which it disappeared almost completely. Only 
&gt; time it came back was at about 5500km when it was due for an oil 
&gt; change. Fresh oil got rid of the noise again. Can't say it will work 
&gt; on all engines, but since I planned to switch to synthetic anyway, it 
&gt; was a nice bonus 
&gt;

Shawn,

I had the exact same experience with my '86 westy.  I changed to Syntec
5/50 and I have not had a noise since then.

PS. I did the same thing with my SAAB 9000 and no more noise.


One of my better moves
