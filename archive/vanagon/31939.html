Subject: Re: new engine question

Mark, don't have any insight regarding reliability, but remember, the
engine you buy may be &quot;complete&quot; as a engine, but lacking as a complete
powerplant. That is, does it include a carburator, alternator, exhaust
system, etc. These are items that can add up when you're considering the
cost of getting your Westy on the road.

Thanks! Joe


&gt;        I am considering purchasing an '83 Westy without an engine.   I
&gt;live in the Los Angeles area and am wondering how dependable these engines
&gt;are that many sell complete, for under $1000.  Has anyone experience with
&gt;these businesses?  If so, which engines and companies are reccomended?
&gt;TIA.
