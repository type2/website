Ummm.

The point is, somebody needs vanagon parts.  If you can help him locate a
source, why do you care what his religious beliefs are, and I doubt that
keeping his friends vanagon running is going to cause the destruction of
Belize's indigenous culture.  Belize is a British Colony, not a small,
undiscovered island with no links to the modern world.


Cheers.
