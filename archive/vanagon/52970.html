NO, unfortunately you have a vehicle that there just isn't that much
info. out on.  The best I can say is find someone in your area that has a 
Vanagon and talk to them.
       good luck

&gt; Ever since the weather got colder, the power locks on my '87 Westy seem 
&gt; to be 'frozen' - not as in 'frozen with ice in the lock', but like the 
&gt; electrical connections are preventing the locks from moving. When I turn 
&gt; the key or press down the lock button, there's a huge resistance, like 
&gt; with 2 resisting magnets, &amp; they just don't lock.  Not conducive for 
&gt; taking my van on outtings into the city!  This happened last winter too, 
&gt; &amp; finally cleared itself up around June.  Who knows, maybe it has 
&gt; absolutely nothing to do with the weather - I'm in Seattle &amp; it's not 
&gt; cold like Minnesota - but regardless, help!!
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?  I don't know much about VW engines, let alone electrical 
&gt; systems, but if somebody could point me in the right direction I'd 
&gt; appreciate it!
&gt; 
&gt; Also, it has become apparent to me that as a Vanagon owner I really need 
&gt; to learn how to maintain &amp; repair it myself.  Any suggestions for 
&gt; elementary books, other than Bentley, which I've heard is more for the 
&gt; already-initiated?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
