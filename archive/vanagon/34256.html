Subject: some Weber / carb questions

Hi all,
	OK, I have some weber carb questions I hope someone can help
me with.  I've ordered the weber book (not the haynes, but the other
one) but it may not be here until next week and I want to look at some
things while I do a tune-up this weekend.

First of all, what kind of Weber carb do I have?  I have a Weber,
but I can find no markings besides a 26 and a 27 on the barrels.  Is
this a DFAV 32/36?  A second question is where is the accelerator
pump?  I would like to check and see if it is sticking.  I've looked
at the carb a bit, and maybe someone can identify some parts for me.

there is a nut on the bottom side of the carb where the fuel line
attatches.  This has a slight oil drip.  What is this nut and, what
kind of thing can be done for the drip?

On the front (FIF) and the bottom of the carb is a hose that goes to
the oild breather.  what's this for, and what is an oil breather's
function?  Is the oil breather the same thing as an oil cooler bath?

On the back left is a square peice, with a screw in each corner, and a
round piece in the middle that says WEBER.  There is a lever in the
middle of the round piece.  When I move it, it sounds like something
is opening up.  What is this?

Now for the screws.  There are five that I saw that were adjustable.
If some one could tell me, I'd love to know what each of them is for. 

1) back, right, angled a bit, attached to the piece that moves when
   you give it gas.
2) back, center, and low.  has a spring on it.
3) one to the right of the place where the gas line attaches
4) and one at the front.

Are three and four the idle jet holders?
Is one the idle adjustment screw?

Where is the choke and how do I check it?  

I think that's all for now.  Thanks everyone for any help you can
give!  

take care,
	brandy
