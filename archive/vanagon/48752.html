Subject: more on A/C Water

Hi Folks... thank you for the many many replies to the orginal post.  I
followed up on the advice re the ruber tubes.  I inserted pipecleaners but
cam up against no obvious obstruction al all, yet again more water appeared
during a trip this weekend.  Methinks I'll have to take the a/c unit out to
really find the culprit.
