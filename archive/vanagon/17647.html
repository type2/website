I'll second (or third) the recommendation for Fred's Garage.
What I like, besides what's already been offered, is that 
they have long hours: 7:30 AM- 6:30 PM, and you don't need an appointment.
If I bring my '85 Westy in by 9am, they almost always have
it ready the same day.  And you can get  a loaner car from their
impressive collection of nearly dead VW's if you reserve it a few
days ahead.
