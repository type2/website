Subject: Radiator/Condensor fan

After replacing a burst a/c hose on my '86 westy, I took it in to have th=
e
system charged. The shop discovered that the condensor fan is not coming
on. They let the pressure go up to 400#, but the fan never came on.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this electrical
problem? The 30A fuse is intact, but that's as far as I got.
The shop says it could cost as much as $200 for them to troubleshoot, a
cost I would very much like to avoid.
