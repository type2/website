Subject: Early Distributor Question

        This one is for the Clara Williams and Jon Christensen's among us..

        I got four early, cast iron distributors with this parts stash.

        VJU4 BR8 (2 of these, one with thin wire clips, the likes of which
I've never seen before)
        VJR4 BR18 (no vaccum advance hookup)
        0 231 153 009 (yes, a 009, but really really old!)

        Any idea what motors these woulda come from?

        On my '54s motor, (# -20-0816018) I have a VJR BR8

        These distributors don't appear to be in very bad shape, a bunch of
grease and grime on them, but aside from that they are probably good.  No
caps or rotors, tho :(
