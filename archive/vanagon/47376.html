&gt; Just a few weeks ago, I replaced that section of pipe on my 85.  Yes, the Bosch
&gt; sensors are expensive ($60-80); however, your FLAPS can get you a &quot;universal&quot;
&gt; one that requires a small bit of wiring on your part, for about $20--apparently
&gt; works just the same.

Mine screws into the converter and not the pipe section, but if a 
universal one works, why does anyone buy the bosch in this case?  By the 
way, the bosch for the '87 is around $140.  The reason I ask is that when 
I called busboys, they first quoted ma e price  for the '85 O2 sensor 
which is about half the price of the '87 sensor.  I assume that there 
must be some difference.

&gt; with getting gaskets off, but with getting the darn old bolts out.  Had to heat
&gt; them up with a propane torch and punch them out--a real pain.

Do you have your own torch?  I drove my vanagon to a local muffler shop, 
and for some reason they torched the bolts for free (the 3 bolts holding 
the connector pipe to the cat. converter).  I also broke the head off one 
of the bolts for the muffler clamp, so they torched that out for me too.  

Guess I'll take the good luck with the bad.
