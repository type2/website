Subject: diesel fuel injectors???


        Hi volks.....another question

First day on the road with the vanagon...small problems...lost hubcap..found
in weeds..

LEAKING fuel injector...QUESTION...is there a procedure and a maintenance
schedule
to clean diesel fuel injectors???

I just finished removing the injector down to the head...WHAT a
mess.._dot_carbon everywhere ...I cleaned with a small bruch in solvent all the
parts and cleaned out the hole where it sits ...replaced all parts as tight
as possible (must be some special wrench to use that i dont have???) Haven't
fired it up yet...SHOULD CHECK WITH THE FOLKS ON THE VANAGON LIST BEFORE
PROCEDING...

                                                        THANKS AGAIN

                                                                Brian

                                                         82 diesel ..sure is
cold in
Virginia ...buuuurrrr
