&gt; 1.  How often can I expect the solenoid to stick from now on?
&gt; 2.  Is this a sign it going to fail permanently soon?
&gt; 3.  How much will it cost me to get it fixed if it does fail?
 
I had a very similar problem this summer on a trip out to VA.  Once I got 
the '71 started again, I found that the selenoid failed only when the bus 
was hot.  It did fine in the mornings, but when we would stop for gas or 
lunch, it would not start unless I crawled underneath to jump across the 
selenoid.  Muir talks about rebuilding the selenoid, but I have not found 
any information on how to do that.(haven't really looked)  My mechanic 
buddy says to just replace the entire starter unit.  so to answer your 
questions....
1. From my experience only when you shut off the van for a short period 
of time.
2. I don't know about how soon, but it indicates something is amiss.
3. Depends on what you do, but a rebuilt starter will run ~$90.
Hope that helps.
