&gt;My Canajun '85 panel has the badge 'Transporter' on the rear hatch. It's
&gt;your for $5,000, and I will include a suitable shipping container, delivery,

hmmmmm. this &quot;suitable shipping container&quot;: does it have four wheels and
headlights? :)

&gt;and do your laundry for a year. But seriously folks, if you want me to ask
&gt;at the dealer for this badge I would be happy to, are they rare or summthin?

they are rare in the states. if you make it by the dealer one day, how bout
asking for the part number and price and estimated delivery time (to you).
there might be a bunch of folks who wouldn't mind ordering through you (or
someone else north of the border). :)
