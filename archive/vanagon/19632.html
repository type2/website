Subject: have a tent, need a bus

Well my wanabus search took an interesting turn yesterday,
I went to a yard sale and bought a beautiful Westy tent
(guy used to have a '74 camper) for $50.  It looks
brand new, now all I need is a bus to stick it to. . . .
am I correct in thinking this will fit all buses, split
and bay window?  what about a vanagon?  just wondering.

Ok, off to surf the WWW tent page  :-)

P.S. If you know of buses for sale (&lt;$2000) let me know!
