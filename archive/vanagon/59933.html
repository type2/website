&gt;There is a two part &quot;bug screen&quot; on our ('85) Westy skylight. It attached

&gt;you can secure it to block out the sun or open it to let in air.  I don't
&gt;know if it is the original configuration or not but it IS made out of the
&gt;same material as the curtains.

I have the same thing on my '90 Westie.

Speaking of this... what *is* the glue-of-choice for getting the Velcro
(tm) strip to stick to the roof???
