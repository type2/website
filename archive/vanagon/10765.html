I know that there is a fact list out there on this, but the original size 
was a 6.40 x 15 which I believe is about the same diameter of a 205/75 x 
15.  It is important to note that when folks complain about the low 
gearing of their older buses that the original tires were a few inches 
taller than the bug's which are often installed on the older splitties.
