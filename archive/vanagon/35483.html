Subject: '71 Westy ?

On may way to work this moring I passed by a orange Westy I have had my eye
on and finally decided to stop.  It is at a small tow yard and has been there
at least a year.  I asked the owner if he was interested in selling it and he
said he was but was waiting to get the title (or registration) and was going to
ask about $200 for it, just the price of the tow and storage.  I took a quick
look at it but was not able to identify the year.  As I said it is orange.  The
body is in great shape, no rust, except under the front window which was 
repaired well.  It has Alabama plates so I guess it missed the rust belt.  It 
has the pop top that opens from the front and the sink right inside the door.  
It has disc brakes and an upright engine, but I believe it has the new larger
taillights.  Does all this add up?  I think the '71 had the small taillights 
and may not have come in orange.  Could an upright engine have been added to a
newer bus?  
By the way the engine doesn't run but is all there.  How is $200-$300 sound for
a excellent body with a dead? engine.  Oh yeah, the front window is badly 
cracked.
