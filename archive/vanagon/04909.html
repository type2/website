Well, I can tell you that none of the WEST coast states do.  I vaguely
remember seeing a *truck* plate from somewhere that was black and
white, but I can't remember what state... Pennsylvania mebbe?  Hmmm...
maybe it was Texas.  California used to use Black plates with *yellow*
letters, but they went to a blue background around 1970 or so.  They
are kinda hard to find now.

p.s.  My choice for a *new* car costing under $300K is... the Porsche 911
turbo 3.6 ragtop (I think that model exists, anyway...).  I would have
gone for the Ferarri, but the gas mileage sucks...
