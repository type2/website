Subject: Camper Propane Tank

Such speedy replies for my camper bed question, thanks everyone.  
As a new owner of a '85 Westie Camper, I haven't filled the gas bottle 
yet.  In MA, gas bottles have to be pressure checked every 10 years and 
restamped with the date.  This applies to gas grill bottles and torches 
etc.  Has anyone found a problem betting an older one filled?  How do 
they do it? (and) in the horrible event it IS no good, where do you find 
a new one for under $800.00? That's what I'm told they cost.  
Thanks in advance.
