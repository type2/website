&gt; many (not all) of the fuel injection systems use bosch fuel pumps, and these
&gt; are &quot;cooled&quot; by the flow of the fuel through the pump. if you run an EFI
&gt; system dry, there is NO fuel in the pump ... which can burn up the pump.
&gt; also you can get some of the crud that is in the bottom of the fuel tank
&gt; sucked into the lines and the pump and possibly the injectors.
&gt; 
&gt; it's not that running out once will completely distroy your system ...
&gt; it won't. i'm proof of that. but it's not something you want to do every week
&gt; or even every month. it' like running your tires with too much (or too little)
&gt; air in them: you're gonna ruin the tires sooner or later.

About 10 years ago I ran out of diesel with an old friend in a Mercedes 240D (diesel).
Luckily we coasted into a gas station and filled up with diesel #2. There was a small
hand pump (akin to a Coleman camp lantern) connected to the FI.  I suppose this purged
the &quot;ring main&quot; of air and pressurized the lines w/diesel.  We were on our way in minutes.

Keep an eye on that fuel gauge over the weekend, folks. :-)
