Subject: Re: DEALER SURVEY PLEASE RESPOND.

The only dealer on Southern Vancouver Island now is Speedway Motors.  My
experience with them is bitter.  I believe I can say this because I have
bought 3 out of 5 new VW's from them and persuaded 6 other friends to buy
new VW's and all bought them from Speedway (and yes, they're all still
friends...no thanks to Speedway).

Service:  expect to go back 2-3 times to get the problem fixed 85% of the
time.   If you get the right Service manager and then the right mechanics
you can get away first crack lucky.  I have a history of idiotic mistakes
that they've made on my vehicles that have induced other problems.  There
is not one, repeat one person I know that has thought beyond satisfactory
for this dealership in service.

Sales:  I recently took a GM-Type friend in to test-drive a Jetta GLX
(VR6).  Well, he didn't even get to drive it until I told the salesman that
I was incredibally put-out by his attitude.  He drove the thing for 15
minutes and then let my friend take the wheel for the last 5 (after major
complaining) in heavy traffic...GREAT!  his excuse was that my friend's
wife wasn't with him even though this was to be  his business vehicle,
leased for business and his wife had the Buick and couldn't drive standard!
Anyhow, my friend liked the car but will not buy from them if he considers
a VW now.  He went and took out a Sunfire and was treated like royalty.

Poor attitude, poor service, inflated egos and prices.  I don't know where
I'll buy my next new VW from.  Maybe I'll keep buying used from other
dealers...like the Honda dealer I bought my Westy from!  Bruce
