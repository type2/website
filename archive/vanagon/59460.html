Lloyd,

As far as I know, there is only one general coverage Owners Manual
available for the Vanagon/Transporter of all models.
I have an original 1989 Transporter sales brochure, which covers all
models(single and double cab, and vans)  and includes technical
information, from which I have made copys.  If you are interested please
e-mail directly.

Rick
