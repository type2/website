&gt; Doin' the ol' tuneup this afternoon, I checked my compression for the

&gt; #1= 135		#2= 130		#3= 107		#4= 135

&gt; I assume #3 is toast. How bad would you say this is? How soon does it 
&gt; need attention? all plugs have white deposits, so I'm gonna assume its 
&gt; running too lean...

I wouldn't say your engine is toast just yet.  Have you checked the valve
clearences lately?  Make sure the #3 valves are not cranked down too tight.
Keep a close watch on the compression, and if it goes any lower, pull the
heads and have a valve job done.  While your motor does not meet the 15%-
between-highest-and-lowest rule, it is not too far off, and if you take it
easy, it could well last quite a while.  I suspect your #3 exhaust valve
is just a little crusty and is not sealing as well as it used to.
