Subject: VW NewYears Resolutions (F)

On the &quot;other&quot; list there is an appropriate thread going on. Being Friday
and close to the year end I think it's  a really good idea. What are your VW
resolutions?

Rusty VanBondo resolves:

1.&gt;To get my _at_#$%^&amp;*! '67 Westy Resto From Hell out of the  _at_#$%^&amp;*! paint
shop from hell and get it on the road! ;)  January 15th makes 16 months in
this shop and over two years of  resto &quot;in progress&quot; so far!   $200 paint
job by a relative (my butt). Color me two toned- foolish over patient.

2.&gt;Write a tell all book of memoirs about OJ and me. The behind the scenes
look at why Al Cowlings was the second choice for a get away after the
VanBondo '57 Single cab broke down... No wonder he looked pissed! ;)

3.&gt;To receive at least one SOTO newsletter per year.

4.&gt;To trust everyone more especially relating to catalog parts purchases and
&quot;sight unseen deals.&quot;

5.&gt; Not to be a smart ass or a dumb ass.

6.&gt;Not to grovel for '66-'67 Westfalia &quot;what-not&quot;spicerack  cabinets unless
I hear of a good one to be had.
