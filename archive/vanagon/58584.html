Subject: Speedometer cable

My 82 Westy has a broken lower speedometer cable and I dont seem to be
able to figure out how to get it loose from the front wheel.  The bugs I
have had before all had a &quot;c&quot; clip on the dustcover which would allow
you to pull the cable out.  This one the sleeve covering the cable will
pull out, but the cable stays secure.  Any suggestions???
Thanks, Chaz
