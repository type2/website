Hey, couldn't a propane lantern use up your oxygen and produce
CO, also?

I want the heater for personal warmth.  

Would you guys out there who have the catalyic heaters
drive with them on? 

Is Dave Garth the only one who has a vented/ducted in/out
such catalyic heater?  Dave, does this mean you don't 
get a moisture problem?
