Subject: westy H20 leak


Last weekend, I worked long and hard to get my sink/faucet/drain
stuff operating properly in preparation for the Red Rock trip.  It
all works fine, except that I'm convinced (after finding a lot of
water on the &quot;living room&quot; carpet of the westy) that I have a leak
in one or more of the following places:

1.  the water tank itself
2.  the line form the tank to the pump
3.  the line from the pump to the faucet
4.  the line from the sink down to the outside drain

Help!  Has anyone had this happen?  Any suggestions for how to track
it down (please remember I am NOT very left-brained  :(            )
