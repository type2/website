 Gang,
 
         As the original poster for this thread, I wish to say THANKS!  I really 
 appreciate the helpful hints, tips and comments.  A nice, helpful group.  
 (Typical for VW owners I think!)  I found a van to my liking in dark blue 
 (can't be too picky!).  20,000 mi and in great shape.  Will be taking a 
 round-the-US trip this summer in it.
 
 Best wishes to all,
 
 Roger Traylor
