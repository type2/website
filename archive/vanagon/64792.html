Vanagoners:

        I want to sell my Vanagon because I use it only as a daily driver, to and
from work. I'm the original owner.
        Details:                VIN     WV2YB0257MH002570
                        111K miles, 13K on new engine and cooling hoses (dealer installed),
automatic
                        A/C compressor 2 years old, drier, expansion valve 1 year old, Orly
Blue, Gray interior
                        new CV joints around 80K miles, always lived in Mobile so no rust

        Joel Walker has seen and driven this vehicle. I trust he wouldn't mind
giving his opinion if you emailed him privately.
        I'm asking $9995.
        Let's make market for this vehicle. I got little response from Auto/Truck
Trader.  :(
