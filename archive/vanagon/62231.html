Subject: FS:  2.1 wbx eng. (Nor Cal.); was 2.1wbx engine needed

I'd consider selling mine.  This would be the complete 2.1 engine,
flywheel, clutch, bellhousing, all engine accessories, ECU, engine wiring
harnesses and hoses, i.e., a conversion kit.  It has about 150,000 miles on
it and 50,000 on the heads.  If anyone is interested, I'll come up with a
discount price after surveying local dismantlers.  

The complete air conditioning system would be available separately.  I
might even be willing to sell the power steering complete, too.  All of
these parts are on a daily driver located in Davis, California.  It's a '88
GL.
