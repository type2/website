Subject: Re: table for vanagon westies


I have a '79 Westy that's pretty much original, and I too had a lot of 
trouble finding a table.  Finally I came up with the idea to use the 
stove cover piece for a table top.  It's pretty much big enough, matches 
the rest of the interior, and requires no additional storage.  I removed 
the hinges from the bottom and installed countersunk nuts on the top of 
the stove wood molding, drilled holes to match in the top of the stove 
cover piece, and hold the top/table down when not being used via thumb 
screwed bolts inserted through the top (works quite well).  I then 
screwed a piece of shelving bracket (the kind with small holes every few 
inches) into the front of the stove assembly at the correct height, 
and inserted screws of appropriate size (to fit in the small shelving 
bracket holes) on the appropriate end of the &quot;table&quot; top.  These are 
left protruding enough to enable their use as anchors to the bracket.  
Finally, I found some cupped fixtures into which 1 1/2&quot; diameter aluminum 
piping fits, installed two on the other (non bracket-anchored) end of the 
&quot;table&quot;, and cut the piping to appropriate length (with rubber caps on 
the bottom of each pipe).  The pipes store underneath the hammock in the 
under-seat compartment.

The whole thing works quite well, actually.  Disadvantages: not quite as 
large as the stock table, but still permits use by three seated persons 
(if friendly) on back seat, and an additional two in camp chairs on the 
other side; (this is an important caution) the top is no longer hinged, 
and therefore  modification must be made to maintain the safety feature 
of the metal plate on the top that guards against burning up the van 
curtains.  This hasn't been a problem, through.


My terminology is fuzzy, but perhaps you get the idea.  It may be worth 
trying for some of you &quot;non-table wanna be's&quot; (care to make a count, Joel?).
