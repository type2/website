Subject: Rust prevention...


I've been checking around locally and the only rust prevention stuff
available and suitable for injection into frame heads etc is by a company
called Crown.

This stuff is a liquid that does not dry to a hard surface but rather
stays liquid and contains penetrating agent, seeping agent, rust destroyer, 
rust inhibitor, etc, etc.

They company charges 100$CDN for a car, or sells 5 gallons for 250$CDN
(enough for 4-5 cars).  They apply it everywhere: inside doors, window frames,
frame heads, under the car, above the trany, behind bumpers, wheel wells,
tunnel, everywhere.  They also recommend yearly applications.

Anyone heard of this stuff?  Opinions on it? 

I'm not crazy about the yearly applications.  The bottom of the car will be
cleaned, painted, protected this weekend so uncoating with the stuff will
probably not be needed, but window frame injections and above the trany etc 
might be desirable.
