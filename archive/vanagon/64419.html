Subject:      re Eurovan T belt Broke at 73K!!!!!

&gt;
&gt;  As some of you know I work in a repair shop too,  On the Hook came a 94
&gt;Eurovan 73K
&gt;on the clock.  Timing belt broke!
&gt;
&gt;  This tells me a couple of things;
&gt;
&gt;  One that if there is an interval to do a service, LISTEN!
&gt;
&gt;  And 2 that the theroy of the newer timing belts being made similar to
&gt;the Japanese
&gt;car belts lasting 90 K, I Don't Think So!
&gt;
&gt;  Just want ed to pass on the word about the Mileage.  I've seen Jettas,
&gt;Golfs Etc go
&gt;80-90K on a belt.  The weight of the vehicle may have something to do with
&gt;the mileage
&gt;too.
&gt;
&gt;  Eurovan Drivers Beware.
&gt;

What kind of damage, if any, was done to the engine by running with a
broken belt  (however briefly that may have been?)

As for the service interval on these: Volvo dropped theirs a few years back
from 60K miles down to 45K I think it was. I didn't find out until it was
time for a 60K mile service though! Luckily it didn't break. So it's not
just VW's that need to be watched.
