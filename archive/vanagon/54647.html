Subject: next CCC's outing


This past weekend in the cabin at Tahoe was great fun.  While there,
we were discussing future dates and places for the next CCC's
camping trip.  Nominations were made for the 2nd half-ish of March,
meaning one of the last two weekends in that month.  A small group
of us will probably make a reconnaissance trip to check out
potential sites soon and will report back.  

In the meantime, perhaps those of you who wish to attend could
give me your vote for which weekend in the last half of March
suits you, and site nominations as well.

Thanks,
