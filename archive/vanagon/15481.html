&gt; I agree  on the lithium, better but expensive is cv joint grease as it
&gt; does not harden and is impervious to water. I use it on all linkages (gear
&gt; shift front and rear) and door locks as well as the upper sliding part of
&gt; the door.....DC

Oddly enough, I'd like to note that genuine AUTOBAHN CV joint grease
is a bargain, $10 for a 14 oz tube last fall when I repacked the joints
on the '76 before selling her. As most people want $3-$4 for a 3oz tube
for each joint, VW finally has a bargain here.  Good stuff to, can't
believe I was paying $3.50 a tube from Parts Place for the same stuff.
