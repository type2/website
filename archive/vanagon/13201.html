&gt; I am shopping for tires for my vanagon again too. One of tire dealers I 
&gt; talked
&gt; to said 6 ply tires and the reinforced tires are the same thing.
&gt; 
&gt; For XZX 185R14 reinforced side walls they want $66 each. After tax and all
&gt; sorts of charges they want $350 for 4 wheels. I want to shop around more.

David, just for another reference point...I put a new set of tires on my '82 
Westy about 20k miles ago. I opted for the LT195/75R14 Uniroyal Laredos that are
carried by Costco (I went to the one in Santa Clara). They are a reinforced 
sidewall 6-ply light truck tire. Maximum recommended pressure is 50psi. They 
cost $49.99 /ea. Total price including mounting, balance and tax was about $250 
for the set. So far they've been great....quiet and good handling. The 
ever-so-slight size difference is imperceptable, at least to me anyway.

One peculiarity they have is that when you buy them they have these little 
rubber spikes all over them (koosh-ball effect), leading to some interesting 
handling for the first 50 miles or so. I think Costco and/or Price Club carry 
the Yokos as well. Another decent place for prices is Auto Parts Club in Santa 
Clara, if they carry a brand and size you like (selection can be spotty). Last 
month I bought a set of BF Goodrich T/As for the Jetta and had good luck.
