&gt;If you write to Michael, you may want to be nice to him and include a couple
&gt;of one dollar bills, or perhaps even a five dollar bill to cover his postage
&gt;cost. I'll bet he'd also appreciate a self-addressed envelope or a stick-on
&gt;label with your address on it.

There is a lot of confusion about International Reply Coupons (IRCs) among
the ham radio community, which is far and away the single largest user of
IRCs. An IRC is supposed to be good for the smallest unit of airmail postage
in any participating country. Apparently, some postal systems interpret that
to mean the smallest unit of postage, period, i.e., surface mail. Last I
heard, IRCs were 95 cents each in the USA. For Germany, you'd be best off
sending two IRCs if you want an airmail return. It just seems easier for me
to send two one dollar bills.
