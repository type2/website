Subject: Re: Help: 89 Westy w/Noisy Speedometer

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know a common failure/problem that would cause a speedo to
&gt;&gt;click constantly while driving? (needle bounces also) Current mileage
&gt;&gt;92,000. Should I replace(new/used), or tear into the speedo head?
&gt;
&gt;Although I agree with Steve Mather....when my speedo acted up by clicking
and jumping I tore into the speedo only to find the the plastic gear
that drove the odometer was partially stripped and therefore caused a bit
of binding and thats what caused the needle to jump.  If you disconnect
the cable and insert something in the hole(pencil) and rotate it by hand the 
needle should move smoothly.  If after rotating it a while you find that
it binds...you know you have a problem inside.
