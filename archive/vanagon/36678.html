Correct procedure is to watch where garages &amp; tyre places put their
body lifts &amp; trolley jacks !! (And to tell them if you're not happy)

Unless you hear otherwise, try judicious use of a Big Screwdriver,
bodging bar, etc.....

Check that jacking point itself hasn't *moved* - it means that there
may be rust (shock horror) in the sill assembly.
