Hey Eugene,  
  I know what u mean about the top.  Noticed a couple other posts, but	
no solution.  Mine was moving around a little also, like every time a
truck went by :O .  After 5 years I finally looked to see exactly what 	
is holding it down in front.  It's kinda like the refrigerator light	
dilemma; there's a latch that catches, but you can't see it when the top
is down...  I got in there and gently bent the 'hook' up a little. That	
definitely helped with the high wind situation.  It still squeaks a little
when the trucks go by, but I figure that if I'm going 60, the truck is 
going 90, and the wind is blowing 25 against me, that's a lot of wind!!	
I just live with it, knowing my bus is the coolest thing since sliced 
breadloafs.  ;) 	
   Have a day.
