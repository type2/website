&gt; I recently test drove a nice looking Syncro from PA.
&gt; The body was beautiful.  But when I raised the deck lid the motor
&gt; compartment was covered with rust and corrosion.   Is this common in
&gt; cars from the north.   I was certain I was going to purchase the Van
&gt; until I found the rust and corrosion.  The few mechanics I spoke with
&gt; said every nut and bolt on the underside of the van will be rusted
&gt; solid.  Are they correct?
    Rusted yes.... Solid no! I can get apart anything with my blue
    wrench.... My 1936 Chrysler was this way, and I didn't break
    a single bolt. I even have nuts that were almost rusted off
    and I still got them to unscrew!


&gt;
&gt; These vans are hard to find.  I don't want to miss out a good deal.
&gt; Someone with rust and corrosion fighting experience please give me some
&gt; helpful information.  At this point I am afraid I will  Have to pass on
&gt; the Van ??????
   If rust is the only problem buy it.
