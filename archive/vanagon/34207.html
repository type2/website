Tom et al,

I recently had this to say on this subject:

Speaking of wiper relays, I have one in my 87 Syncro that allows for a
variable intermittant timing.  I originally bought this for my Jetta, but
after I totaled it I pulled the relay and stuck it in my van.  I think I
remember paing about $25-$30 for it in about 1987.  It works with no
additional external controls.  You just put the wiper stalk into &amp; back out
of intermittant position, causing the wiper to wipe once.  Then, when the
windshield gets to the point where you want it to wipe again, just put the
stalk into intermittant and leave it.  It will keep wiping at the interval
between the first wipe and when you pushed it back into intermittant mode.

Unfortunately, I don't know where I got this little thing.  I recall phone
ordering it from an advertiser in a VW magazine.  Does anyone know if these
are still available &amp; from who?
