&gt; &gt; Take it from me, Bradley's bus is UGLY.  Of course, mine is even UGLIER.
&gt; &gt; It's almost cute, in a thrashed rusted scratched sort of way.

&gt; No... Mine is uglier!

Bradley, I have to support you here (sorry, David!).  Your bus is much, 
much uglier than David's.  And it's not just me: I asked Christa and she 
agreed with me after pondering the question for about, oh, 1 second.  

I showed photos of Bradley's and David's busses from the Big Sur meet to my 
parents, and while they were much enamoured with the split window design, 
they (independently, I should add!) commented on the ugliness of 
Bradley's bus.

I can see Bradley and David are setting up for a good pissing match here, 
but perhaps we can settle this thing democratically.  There must be pics 
of both David's and Bradley's busses on David's home page, so I suggest 
all the folks on the vanagon list with web viewers mosey over to David's 
page and have a gander at the two busses in question.  Maybe David can 
build in a CGI script to allow voting through his page (if Bradley will 
trust David to handle to vote counting).

:)  ;)

(Whose loaf is *beautiful*... until you look at the underside, where I 
think it would win out in ugliness over even Bradley's split.  Or maybe I 
mean scariness...  =:O  :)    )
