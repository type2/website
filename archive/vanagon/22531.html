&amp; &gt;There's a mounting bracket for this. 

&amp; Yeah, I've got one of these. I just removed it to paint my '76 (and take out
&amp; the dent in the nose). Are these really sturdy enough? What's supporting the
&amp; weight of the spare besides the body panel? 

Nothing. I thought the same thoughts when I took my spare wheel off for
the first time. Then yanked on the bracket a couple of times and finished 
thinking that I've never heard of bus spares ejecting and since even the 
GermanTechnical Inspection (TUeV) accepts it, thus it must be fine.
  That was before I realized that the fourth bolt was stripped ....

I fit mine though with some shims of copper tubing such that when I 
tighten the wheel nuts, the spare is not pressed against the nose panel
but theld in place just by the bolts. Jens.
