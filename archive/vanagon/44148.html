Hey there Everyone!

	Well, Amelia being the wonderful woman she is, at the end of
her 9th month (pregnancy that is:), came on out to work and brought me
a cleavis pin and oatmeal cookies!  She offered (half jokingly) to
replace the cable for me, since she's done it before, and I haven't.
But... I got back under there and hooked it all up.  I did some
looking and saw that the PO used a screw and bolt, that was slowly
eating away at the little U-shaped piece at the end of the cable.
That must have been the creaking noise I heard. It was about halfway
through that little Upiece.  The part on the clutch pedal assembly
looked fine.  Adjusted the clutch and gave the bus a whirl around the
block.  Everything better than before, BUT...  

	Ahhh!!!  Now I can change gears without pressing the clutch
pedal, but only when the motor is off.  If the motor is running, I
have to press the clutch pedal.  Any ideas?  I losened the clutch
cable, till I had the most amount of &quot;allowable&quot; freeplay, but still
no dice.  I figure I'll go ahead and try putting the new clutch cable
in and use the other for a spare, but has anyone had this problem
before?  I'll swap out the clutch cables and play with adjusting it,
and let everyone know what's up.

take care,
	brandy
