&gt;in a fast car behind me on a wet cloverleaf-type on ramp and sandbag it
&gt;until the joker is right behind me.  After i floor it I usually dont see
&gt;them again.

uhmm, do you have a standard engine, or do you have a P-car flat six back
there?...

it seems unlikely that an AWD Vanagon w/o engine mods would be able to pull
away from a &quot;fast car&quot; on a ramp, ground condition notwithstanding, unless
the other driver wasn't interested in playing, or was a weenie driver...

now, if you had purchased your Syncro Vanagon with the James Bond oil 
spewing option, then, my hat's off to you!  :)
