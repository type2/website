Subject: Northwest gathering

I am quite interested in a NW gathering but I don't want to get optimistic
in view of some problems.  The main one is that I can take the vanagon
that far until I replace the head gaskets, and I am not planning to do
that until Spring.  But by all means, put me on the &quot;maybe&quot; list for sure!
