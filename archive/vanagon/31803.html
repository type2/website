Subject: 110 Volt Heaters Not Sufficient

&gt;Conclusion: The easisest and most effective 
&gt;alternative is to stay at an RV Park and run an electric heater. ($30, 
&gt;plus $15/night), but this won't work on cold evenings at a trailhead...

No good either. For winter use, a 110 volt heater is not adequate to heat
the interior to comfy warm conditions--the BTUs are simply insufficient, I
have found.

&gt;Note on heater safety: my CO detector triggered 3-4 times; always due to 
&gt;idling of the engine in the morning....(don't sleep in your car with the 
&gt;engine running :)

exactly what I have found too
