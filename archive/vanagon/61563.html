Subject: e-mail address change

To whom it may concern, my new address is:
JordanVw_at_aol_dot_com

the old address:
JordanView_at_aol_dot_com 

is no longer being used.
(drop a couple vowels and it takes on a whole new meaning..)

Carry on....

(FYI, &quot;Jordan View&quot; was the name of my parents farm that I grew up on in S.E.
PA - &quot;Jordan&quot; being the Jordan Creek, not my first name or any references to
that overpaid basketball player......  :&lt;)
