Subject: Re: Brake Fluid Bleed Questions

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I am attempting to replace the brake fluid in my '87 Westy and I have a couple
&gt;of questions:
&gt;
&gt;1)  Bently mentions the bleed sequence and volumes.  It says there is a front
&gt;upper and a lower bleed screw, but does not show a diagram.  I only see a
&gt;single bleed screw on the front caliper.  Is this the only bleed screw in the
&gt;front?  If not, is that one  the upper or the lower?  Where is the other bleed
&gt;screw located?  If this is the only bleed screw, how much fluid should I remove
&gt;to ensure complete flushing with new fluid?

Dunno, my 87 had two obvious bleed screws up front. Drain fluid until clear
new fluid flows. Takes quite a bit of fluid, I used almost 2 liters.

&gt;
&gt;2)  Is the clutch hydraulic fluid derived from the same reservoir as the brake
&gt;fluid?  If so, should I bleed that, also?

Yes it is, but you don't have to bleed the clutch. Might as well if you
feel ambitious though.
