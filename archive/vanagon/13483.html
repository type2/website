&gt; My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
....

&gt; So, am I alone with this? Any net.experience on remoulding
&gt; recalcitrant posterity?

Just wait a few years until he gets his license and say that's the only vehicle
he can drive.  It will grow on him.  Then he will find out how popular he is
when he can haul 10 of his best friends at the same time.  Driving with the
sliding door open get bonus points.  It worked for me in high school when I
drove a bus.

Is he in a band?  They make great equipment haulers.  My younger brother drove
the vanagon when he was in a band during high school.  Lots of people dig
musicians regardless what you drive.
