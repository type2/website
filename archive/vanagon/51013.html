Subject: Re: diesel engine replacement 

&gt; I need info. about a replacement for my 82 vanagon diesel ...I found a good
&gt; deal          on a low mileage engine from an 86 jetta .
&gt; 
&gt; _it looks like it will fit?? the junkyard guy says no problem!!
 
&gt; -does the 86 jetta engine have more HP than my old 82.
Nope, same 52 hp. Late '86s came with hydraulic lifters - there will 
be a sticker on the valve cover indicating this. Other than that 
engines should be identical.
&gt; -do i need to swap over anything other than the oilpan , oil pump pickup tube, 
&gt;  fly wheel and clutch assembly.
And the oil cooler &amp; &quot;Y&quot; hose  on the oil filter housing - the Jetta diesel doesn't 
have this.

&gt;                                                 keep on surf&quot;in the vw net
