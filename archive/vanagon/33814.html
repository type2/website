Subject: High Idle after driving - '81 Westy

A new engine phenomenon has just recently developed which I am at a loss to
explain.  Perhaps one of the list's more technically-enhanced members can
help me out.

The engine starts and runs just fine.  Even better since I ran a few
bottles of  Techron (actually, Auto Parts Club equivalent by Chevron)
through it a few months ago.  (I posted about that at the time.)  But now,
when I park and idle before shutdown, the idle doesn't come down from the
last engine speed at which I was driving for almost a minute.  If I put it
in gear, step on the brake and let out the clutch a bit, I can &quot;drag&quot; the
idle down below normal, then depress the clutch again and it speeds up to
normal and it stays there.

I've given the engine compartment a cursory inspection and nothing appears
amiss.  Can anyone give me some hints about where to look?

TIA for any help.

Lee
