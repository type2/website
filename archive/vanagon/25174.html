Subject:       RE: AH...why didn't i check the air filter? (and others...)

I have no idea what that box is but I have one to on the '74 engine 
in my '72.  There is nothing in mine and the hose has been cut. If 
anyone can offer insight as to what it is/does and if/how it should 
be reattached I would appreciate it.
