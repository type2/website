&gt;In regards to this:
&gt; On a side note.  What has anyone found that works (without breaking) to take
&gt; off the rear axle nuts???  Last time we had them off we got a BIG socket and
&gt; a BIG breaker bar and put the end of the bar on the ground and used engine
&gt; torque to break the suckers loose.  It was hard even then (the back of the
&gt; bus would start to raise).  I have to adjust/clean up the rear
&gt; brakes/parking mech.
&gt; 
You can get A wrench to fit that nut (it's I think 46 mm for old buses).
You remove the cotter pin, put the wrench on, and bang on it with a
hammer until it comes loose. I had some problems with the reduction
boxes on my bus, and used this quite a bit...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
