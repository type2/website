&gt;Brother Cheese wrote the following calumny:

&gt;&gt;If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the

&gt;
&gt;For which reason I am compelled to defend our honor by contradicting
&gt;him: ;)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The bus has little loops welded to the front of the frame intended for
&gt;&gt;towing use.
&gt;
&gt;Those aren't designed for towing use. They're designed for
&gt;holding the vehicle down when it's on a car carrier being delivered to the
&gt;dealer.  They're pretty weak.  In truth, I tow with them, too, but if you
&gt;do it you ought to be good at it. If you go jerking on those little wire
&gt;loops, there's no reason they shouldn't fail. It is very unwise to
&gt;underestimate the velocity at which a loose tow hook can travel--they can
&gt;punch through sheet metal and easily through windshields. The tow-er
&gt;needn't fear for his life but the tow-ee might consider whether it's best
&gt;to persuade the generous tow-er to use his bumper.

Hey, I'm from the South (well, sort of).  Just a little joke.  Sorry if I
offended anyone down in the land of cotton.

Anyway, regarding the &quot;towing loops,&quot; I quote from the 1979 VW Type II
Owner's Manual:


&quot;Towing eyes

Your Volkswagen is eqipped with towing eyes at the front and rear.  They are
for emergency towing only over short distances.

Place gearshift in Neutral.

Release parking brake.

Brake booster assist will not be operative when the engine is not running.
More brake pedal pressure will be required to bring the car to a stop.

Turn ignition key slightly to the right to unlock steering.

If necesssary, turn on ignition to be able to operate turn signals, parking
and stop lights.

CAUTION - DO NOT leave the ignition on for long periods of time with the
engine not running, as damage to the ignition system may result.

The driver of the towing car must be very careful when driving off and
shifting to avoid sudden and abrupt jerks.

The driver of the towed car must always keep the rope taut.

If you are towing another car, it should not be heavier than your VW.


Emergency towing by commercial tow truck:
Your car can be towed by commercial tow trucks using conventional sling-type
gear.
Always tow with rear wheels off the ground.
If excessive damage or other conditions prevent towing your car with rear
wheels off the ground, use wheel dollies.
Never allow passengers to ride in a towed vehicle for any reason.&quot;

End Quote.
