&gt; obviously trumped-up accounts.  Another cast doubt on the veracity of my
&gt; mileage figures.

Didn't Joel once observe over 40 mpg on his trip computer while drafting
behind a truck on the highway?  I never get over 20 myself but I have a
hightop.  I am inclined to believe that 40 mpg is possible, but I
imagine that to achieve that one would have to be going at a good clip
while having their gas pedal depressed only a fraction of an inch
instead of the usual 3/4 throttle.  I, for one, would notice this, but I
have driven Bob's bus and his throttle cable has even less range than
mine.  It's basically either full throttle or no throttle.  :)
 
As for your posts in general, they may often be tales of woe, but the
style they are written in makes them endearing, and entertaining, and I
kind of enjoy reading them.  I don't think they are out of line (but of
course nobody asked me).  :)
