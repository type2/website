It's not VW's fault on this one, I believe.  The Bentley folks have (for over
3 years) promised a Workshop Manual for the Eurovan.  I've called and bitched
at them a number of times about it, but talk about the project being slower
than molasses goin' uphill in January! :)  Maybe a whole bunch of us oughta
call Bentley direct all at once and try to light a fire under their butt?
