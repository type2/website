I am wondering what to do with that charcoal canister that is hooked 
up to my gas tank.  One of the hoses hooks to the fan housing so that 
air is blown through the thing and into the air cleaner.  I am now 
running an air cleaner that doesn't have such an option.  If I just 
plug both ends of this thing will my tank still work ok or are these 
tubes needed to vent the tank?  Oh, '71 bus.  I am sure the system is 
similar on all vw's that have this setup.  Thanks, Jim
