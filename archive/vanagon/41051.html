Subject:      re: Moose

a fellow at work tells the tale of when he was living in alaska (as an
army brat), and he and his dad were out and about in the family pickup
truck. it seems that Mrs. Moose decided to cross the road just about the
same time their pickup came round the curve. WHAM!! one big moose up on
the hood of the truck ... broke the windshield, crushed the hood, broke
both headlights out, and holed the radiator. scared the bejeesus out of
the humans inside, but didn't really harm them.

so they get the truck stopped, and force the doors open and get out to look
at how to best get this &quot;thing&quot; off the truck so they can try to see how
bad the damage is... and the moose wakes up! scrambles off the hood, stands
around shakily for a moment, then ambles off into the woods ... apparently
unhurt.

the truck had to be towed home.

moral of the story: don't hit a moose. :)
