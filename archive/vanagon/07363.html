Subject: Re: New member's starting problem

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I drove about 4 miles from work to that same darned bank machine, turned 
&gt;&gt;the van off briefly, and it refused to start again.  It sits there now as 
&gt;&gt;I wait for both of us to cool off.  Can anyone help?
&gt;&gt;

I had similar experiences with my 84 vanagon in the last few months. Mine 
missfired while running around 65mph on the freeway. Once it did it so bad
that I had to pull over and then it stopped. I couldn't get it started again.
I had it towed home (the very first time being towed). After it got home it
started fine. 

I swapped all FI and Ignition parts from my 83 westy trying to identyfy 
the bad component. I tried to swap one at a time but then two at a
time untill all were swapped. I could not find any bad part. The problem 
occassionally surfaced still. I swapped all parts back. I got stucked twice
again when stopped shortly and couldn't get it started. It got started fine
each time after resting a few minutes.

I decided to switch gas!!! I switched from Arco to Shell. The problem hasn't
bothered me since then (for about 2 months now). Shell costs a lot more.
Ouch!!! It is about $.10 more per gallon here in San Jose.
