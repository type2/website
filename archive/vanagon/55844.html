Subject: Water tank plate cover

 I'm replacing all the rusty looking screws on the three plate covers 
(it's a retentive thing). However,the two lower screws for the water tank 
plate cover,although they backed off no problem, are in a stubborn spot.
 
The &quot;flap&quot; which looks as if it should flip up doesn't budge, hence 
there's no way to remove the screws unless I drill out the holes which 
allow you to back off the screws in the first place to a larger size.
 
Perhaps the &quot;flap&quot; is seized ? Although I have the impression this is 
maybe just a flap in disguise made this way so it looks like the other 
two plate covers. Any ideas ?

P.S. Thanks all for the info on the P/S wires
