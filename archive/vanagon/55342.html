Subject: Re: Audi Turbo wheels on a Vanagon

well, i was just wondering...

how different are the offsets? since some machining is required are the
offsets different or is the width/height of the rim different..

also, are these available in 14&quot; with the correct bolt pattern?

take care all,

steve white
