Subject: Rear Heater Assembly Question

I finally have all the parts required to reassemble my rear heater--a new
valve, new heater core and O-ring gasket.  My question is, should I use the
RTV sealant/gasket (the blue stuff in a tube) in addition to the O-ring?

Since I took both of the rear seats out and cleaned the cork sound
insulation and the carpet, I also decided to remove the interior panels and
stuff the cavities of the van with R-11 insulation. Even with the interior
parts removed back there, the van is much quieter and solid sounding with
the addition of this insulation.  Cheap solution to sound control.
