In checking out my '88 Westy, I decided to take a look at the spare,
Unfortunately the 19mm bolt that hold the tray that the spare rests on does
not want to come off. Any clever ideas? I was thinking of just finding a
garage with an air wrench that I could talk a mechanic to applying to the
bolt.

My Dad used to have my Grandfathers '37 Buick.  One day, long after we had
stopped using the vehicle, Dad was going to see if he could get it going so my
brother-in-law could take it out to Custer S.D. and make one good car from
two.  He had another out there.  

Dad went to pull the plugs.  Tooooooo tight.  He used a BAW (big as wrench),
still toooo tight.  So, this being a flat head, he poored some liquid wrench
into the holes and came back an hour later.  Still toooo tight.  Soooo he
poured in some more liquid wrench and came back later that afternoon.  Still
tooooo tight.  Soooo he poured in some more liquid wrench and ...... forgot it
for a month.

When he came back to the project, the plugs turned out by hand with his
fingers.

Moral of the story: trust liquid wrench.  It works if you give it some time.
