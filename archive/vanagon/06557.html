&gt;     It's the first time I've been to the Slough meeting. We set off
&gt;     at 06:50 in the V6 Caravelle from Manchester and arrived at Slough at 
&gt;     about 09:54 (amy guesses at average speed?).
&gt;     

Well, depending which way you went, I'd say somewhere around 66mph.
(Ok, ok, I have an unfair advantage...I used to live in Beaconsfield, Bucks.)
