Subject: Re: Route 66


&gt;If *you* ever get here, I'll give you the full Route 66 tour of Greater
&gt;Springfield.

Thank you! I do appreciate it. It would be nice to see it with a &quot;local&quot;
who knows the area, as well as a fellow busaholic! Although, the way
things go, I might have to arrive and blast off almost immediately--
it's 1600 miles to San Diego: two LONG days drive. I hope to arrive
on a Friday evening, and get home by Sun eve, hopefully without falling
asleep at the wheel. Not a late-night driver, I'm afraid.


&gt; What *is* happening with the V6anagon?

Precisely nothing. The PO has received the clutch and $$ deposit, but
has been working 16 hrs/day, 7 days/week on a new computer system. This
just ended yesterday, he says, and so &quot;should&quot; be able to do the install
this week. I told him I wanted to come there on Thanksgiving (he said his
family wasn't doing anything for the holiday and it would be fine). It
might actually slip to the following weekend-- we'll see.

He also still hasn't had a chance to look at the tie rods and rack in
front. He's doing me a huge favor, replacing the clutch, so I don't want
to ask more of him-- just a look-see. I also asked him to resurface the
flywheel, and sent money to pay for that-- evidently he hadn't intended
on doing that part (!). But if I can find out what's loose/shimmying in
the front end, I might show up there with a couple of inner tie rod ends
and boots in my suitcase along with my tools.

Can I tap your wisdom again for a minute? Ever replaced inner tie rod ends
on an '80-'89 Vanagon? Any tricks or gotchas to watch out for? What tools
do I need to take the old ones off? Do I have to use heat? Or would Liquid
Wrench, a set of metric hand tools, and an earnest attitude suffice?

If/when this show ever does get on the road, I have dreams of driving most
of Route 66 from Springfield to SoCal. Time permitting, of course, which it
might not. Doggone, Thanksgiving would be the PERFECT time for the trip,
but family responsibilities may preclude that.

Stay tuned for the next exciting installment of this long-running serial.
Same time, same list.address.
