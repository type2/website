Subject: Quick story, I promise...


	Greets all.  I'm Matt Moffa, 16 years old, and I live in western 
Pennsylvania.  Ever since I saw one, I swore that a VW camper would be my 
first car.  I work at a local theme park (Idlewild park, you can find it 
on the net at http://yahoo_dot_com), and one day, as I was parking cars, I 
saw a BEAUTIFUL yellow, restored camper...(I couldn't tell, but I think 
it was a 72 or 73).  Well, as I was parking, the owner came to get a 
towel for the pool.  I told him &quot;Man, that's a beautiful VW you've got 
there&quot;.  He said &quot;Oh, you like them, huh?&quot;  I replied &quot;Yeah, I've been 
trying to get my hands on one {which I have}, and can't find one&quot;.  To 
which his buddy said...
	&quot;Hey, I've got one for sale back home.&quot;
On the off chance that I could afford it (You bet I'm rollin' in it 
working as a sweeper), I asked the price.  He said...
	&quot;I dunno.  A couple hundred.&quot;
Well, I went on my way to look at it.  It's a 1970 camper, and the 
fella's mom had restored all the seat cushions, put on a new canvas top, 
and it was inspected through October.  All I could see that was wrong 
with it was a spider-cracked windshield, new fuel pump and battery, and 
bumpers.  (The engine was transplanted from a Ghia &lt;sp&gt;, and was in great 
condition)  We settled on $250, and my father drove it home for me.
	Sounds too good to be true?  It turns out...Well, I could see 
that it needed some touch-up body work on the bottom rim of the beaut, 
but nothing major.  A little putty under the fingernails, if you know 
what I mean.  When my dad (I don't have my permit, because I don't have 
my birth certificate, thank you Penn.) took it to be inspected, the folks at 
the garage called him a glutton for punishment.  The frame is so rusted 
you can poke through it with a pencil...(Ouch).  I'm gonna need a lot of 
welding, and a whole new front axle assembly.  But, I don't have that 
much cash.  I'm hurting, not because my generator died at the same time 
(honestly) that Jerry Garcia did, so much as that my virgin car may not 
be the Camper I want it to be.  I was glad to get it because my dad owned 
an original '69, and I knew he could help me fix it.  So, now where do I 
go?  Where can I get a front axle assembly cheap, and where in PA can I 
find people who love VWs enough to do the welding?  My friends all want 
to see this puppy on the road, as do I.  Even my girlfriend told me over 
the phone how impressed she was by it.  (Now THAT'S a keeper)  
	So, tell me, o masters of the net's true VW karma, what're my 
choices?  Give it to the local Vo-Tec?  Get it done right by holding up a 
bank for the cash?  Sleep with the mechanic's daughter?  Promise NOT to 
sleep with the mechanic's daughter?  I trust on you for your help, as I 
know you feel the passion I do.
