Subject: Flame bait :-) /f

	Bob reintroduces himself with:

&gt;But perhaps I shouldn't ruffle any feathers; the list owner of the vintage
&gt; vw list kicked me off after I pointed out a number of dangerous errors in
&gt;the wildly popular VW manual written by John Muir.
&gt;
&gt;-Bob

	Too much of a tease! WHICH dangerous errors in Muir? Its really 
just a tech manual, not a bible. I'm sure you can utter the forbiden words 
here- heck, most of us think Muir is all wet on one point or another. Its 
still a good book, I still use mine. The point of this list is the open 
exchange of VW Vanagon and other Transporter model information. 

	Muir advises hand-rolling a cigaret and lighting it while
playing tunes on the throttle with your foot rather than the automatic
choke- that's way dangerous in my book. What were you thinking of?



	In response to Matt's wondering how one can justify running
a lawnmower engine with not emissions control (That's an assumption
too- you can get catalyzed lawnmowers...) Wm. Kennedy asks how one can 
justify:

. airconditioning in ANY car
. taking vacations in privately owned vehicles
. mowing lawns with gas powered tools
. more than Diesel Vanagon power in ANY car
. speed limits over 55; 45; 25; horsedrawn speed; walk speed
. eating more than 2000 calories a day
. taking vacations
. educating my child instead of feeding yours
. ad infinitum

	I guess you just pick your fights (eg ones you can win!). You 
strike a balance. Its like the old rabbi said: 

&quot;If I am not for me, who will be? If I am only for myself,
what am I? And if not now, when?&quot;. 

	I suspect that running an lawnmower engine on the roof *isn't*
worth it to get air condtioning, which is why very few do it. On balance,
I find operating a non-catlayzed car a much more common activity, and one
that is obviously more harmful to the world at large. But I love old cars.
I guess I live with the contradiction. I keep 'em running as good as I
can. 

	Cleaning your plate *DOESN'T* feed starving children in Africa. 
Eating a whole bag of Oreo cookeis doesn't kill someone in Asia. You CAN 
choose to spend your marginal dollars here or there, and you can do great 
good with them. You can make a difference. But not by silent self sacrifice.
Maybe you earn points with your god for not taking vactions, but you don't 
help anyone else directly, unless you are trying to set a spiritual example.
Take a vacation. Trust me. EVERYONE will be happier.

	(and educating one child instead of feeding another sounds like
the real question people confront all around the world, every day. There's
ALWAYS another starving child. Feed some, make your kid work a summer job.
People make these decisions all the time. To what extent is it my problem
that someone has kids they can't feed? I'm trying to make *damn* sure I
can feed my family, if I get that lucky)

	Your milage may vary and all that!

	Bill
