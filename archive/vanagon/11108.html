EXTRAVAGANT UTILITY
Andrew Kirk
Autocar, February 18, 1987

If you have to travel by bus it doesn't have to be slow and tedious;
all you have to do is have Oettinger tune your Caravelle and that
humble VW is transformed with the power of a 165bhp engine.

Chances are you will never come across a Volkswagen Caravelle that
looks, performs and sounds like this one. If you do, the best advice
we can give is to move over and let it past. Have you ever heard a VW
Caravelle that sounds like a Porsche? This one does and its perhaps not
surprising when you realise that a whopping 3.2-litre flat six engine
lurks in the rear.

This Oettinger Caravelle is but one of many conversions to come from
the tuning concern founded by Gerhard Oettinger outside Frankfurt in
1946. Oettinger has always preferred to work with Volkswagen products,
initially converting the original cable-operated Beetle brakes to a
more efficient hydraulic system, but is perhaps best known for his
engine work.

Volkswagen commissioned him to build a flat-six experimental engine
years ago; it was never adopted by the motoring giant, so Oettinger
bought its production rights and now offers two six-cylinder
alternatives as motivation for the long-serving Caravelle range.

The 3.2-litre engine has a bore of 94mm and stroke of 76mm and a
capacity of 3164cc, the same internal dimensions as the 2109cc
Volkswagen flat four. The explanation is that Oettinger has managed to
graft on an extra pair of cylinders and barrels, together with a revised
crankshaft and crankcase to achieve this conversion. Compression is set
at 9.8:1 and fuel is delivered by Oettinger's own digi-jet fuel
injection. Power output is a creditable 165 bhp at 5000 rpm with a
peak torque of 191 lb ft.  That's considerably more than the 112 bph at
4800 rpm and 128 lb ft torque set at 2800 rpm of the 2109cc Volkswagen
engine and substatially more than the 78 bhp at 4600 rpm and 108 lb ft
torque at 2600 rpm offered by the smaller 1913cc flat-four.

In the case of the 3.2-litre conversion, power is fed to the rear wheels
via a Volkswagen three-speed automatic gearbox with revised and
strengthened internals to meet the greater demands made upon it and to
suit the bigger engine's different power and torque characteristics.
The 165 bhp conversion also comes with uprated brakes, huge ventilated
discs front and solid rears.

The rest of the conversion is carried out to individual customer
requirements and in the case of the test vehicle, no expense had been
spared to produce a more complete and impressive conversion. The
suspension is lowered by 2 ins all round and uprated springs and dampers
substituted, but otherwise the suspension layout is unchanged.

An Oettinger Caravelle body kit, costing about 1750 Pounds, is fitted to
the lower half of the transporter and that consists of a front
bumper/spoiler, sill extensions and a rear bumper/under-valence section.
All parts are colour keyed to add further impact to the visual
transformation. Oettinger also offers a more specialised wheel and tyre
combination costing 650 Pounds per corner using Rial light alloy wheels
measuring 7x15 ins fitted with low profile 235/55VR 15 Goodyear Eagles.

Inside, the specification of this German registerered Caravelle GL Carat
is high, with swiveling centre seats, folding picnic table, built-in
stowage compartments in the rear, reclining rear seats, and special
reading lights. In addition, an 'Executive Pack' comprising power
steering, central locking, tinted glass and air conditioning is also
included. More specialized Oettinger fitments include a leather-bound
sports steering wheel, full Oettinger instrumentation with a higher
calibrated speedometer, rev counter, plus oil temperature and pressure
gauges. As a result, a driver has all the necessary information and
creature comforts he might require to make driving the Caravelle a
rewarding experience. But it's the engine that's the most rewarding
part of this VW, allowing a reasonable turn of speed whenever conditions
permit, even if it does help make the conversion 150 kg heavier than the
base Caravelle GL. The engine, extensive air conditioning system and
larger 85-litre fuel tank, replacing the previous 65-litre item, all
add up.

Performance is not exactly staggering but certainly a cut above the
norm by Caravelle standards. Even operating through the power-robbing
three-speed automatic transmission, we were able to cut the 0-50 mph
dash to 8.1 secs, compared with 11.7 for the 2.1-litre engined Caravelle
five-speed. Top speed is better still, 106 mph rather than 91 mph,
though such velocities are a little irrelevant when you experience how
much buffeting the transporter is subjected to. Even with its lower
stance and aerodynamic aids, the large, flat-fronted Oettinger Caravelle
was easily blown off course.

That is not to say that the vehicle is unsafe; it simply illustrates
that it was not designed to attain such speeds in the first place;
treated with respect, however, and driven within its aerodynamic
limitations, a driver cannot fail to enjoy what this Oettinger
conversion has to offer.

The most impressive performance gains are from, say, 20 mph to 70 mph,
where the usefully increased torque delivers performance more akin to
that of a 2-litre saloon car. Indeed over the 20-40 mph increment the
Oettinger Caravelle is quicker than a new 2.4-litre V6 Granada, for
instance. Acceleration does not begin to tail off noticeably until
70 mph is reached with the Caravelle feels increasingly slowed by the
turbulent airflow which is generated.

Considering just how specialised is this conversion, the Oettinger
Caravelle is still very easy to drive, perhaps even more so now with
its power-assisted steering, automatic gearbox and higher level of
interior luxury. In addition there is considerably improved grip and
handling matched to a very supple ride considering the stiffer
suspension settings. You can still generate plenty of body roll in hard
cornering, but unless the wheel is turned sharply and power kept on,
all that will develop is a progressive understeer. If power is kept on,
then the inside rear wheel just begins to lift and spin, limiting speed
in the process. For all its size, the Oettinger Caravelle handles like
a very well sorted saloon car, has precise and responsive steering and
enough feel, except at motorway speeds, to let a driver know exactly
what the wheels are doing.

The complete conversion as tested here is thorough ... and expensive.
Mind you, a customer can opt for a less costly state of build, either
a body conversion, engine transplant or even just a selection of
Oettinger accessories.

UK importer and VW main dealer, Scotts of Sloane Square, which has
recently taken over as sole agent for Oettinger engine conversions
and accessories, is able to carry out conversions on right-hand-drive
versions, too, and with Oettinger engines and suspensions VAG-approved,
there can be no denying the quality of parts used.
