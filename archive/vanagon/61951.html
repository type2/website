&lt;&lt; Anyway, the problem with the Vanagon dash is that there's not any good
 place to put extra gauges.  I could put them to the right of the radio, but
 then they're out of my line of sight.  I'm thinking of one of the 2 or 3
 gauge clusters that RMMW sells mounted on top of the dash, over the speaker
 grille so I can still use my ashtray (I don't smoke but it makes a handy
 change holder).  How do those gauge pods typically mount?  Screws? 
 Adhesive?  
  &gt;&gt;

get a gauge cluster out of a Audi 4000, S or E, '82-'84 vintage. 
This fits right into area on heater duct cover faceplate (plastic panel
behind gearshift)
