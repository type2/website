Subject: Re: mpg?

I just did a tune-up on my 90 camper and I'm averaging 19.58 mpg around
town.  go figure.  sure I may have done a little highway driving, but
not much...

and to think, I'm selling this van (don't ask me why, its killing me) to
a fellow listmember.  He's coming tomorrow to get it.  I'm going to miss
it.  

The thought occured to me as I was cleaning it out, that unlike _any_
other car I've ever had, its impossible to lose a french fry under the
seat of a vanagon (at least in the camper).  I'm going to miss that...

&gt; What kind of gas mileage do you folks get? We're getting 13 to 15 mpg in
&gt; town and on average 20 mpg on the highway. Our vw mechanic thinks we should
&gt; be doing better than this and have more power too.
