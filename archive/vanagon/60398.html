Subject: transplant update - 35,000 miles



My '82 westy with the '92 1800 8V engine just turned 140,000 miles the 
other day, which means I've put 35,000 miles on the engine in three years 
(the engine came with 20,000 miles).

Coincidently it happened the same time I did any sort of repairs on it, 
replacement of timing belt, new cam seal, new idler pulley seal, new 
valve cover gasket, and adjustable cam gear.

The engine is driven hard and I'm very happy at how it has performed.

The adjustable cam gear was set up with 2 degrees advance, a 
conservative start to moving the max torque point down the rpm range. It 
has made a difference, engine &quot;comes on cam&quot; a little sooner. Will try a 
4 degree advance this weekend.
