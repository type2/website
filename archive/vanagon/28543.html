Subject: Auto Techs: the Next Generation

During the recent thread on Quality -or- They Don't Make 'Em Like 
They Used To, reference has been made as to the difficulty, if not 
impossibility of repair on modern fuel, computer, or electrical systems.  
Well.....

Those systems can and are being repaired.  However, they are being 
diagnosed and repaired by well-trained technicians that have a good 
understanding of the fundamentals of engine systems in addition to 
system specific training.  Modern autos are unquestionably complex, 
and yes, often beyond the repair of the corner garage hack that makes 
his bread and butter on oil changes and car washes.  BUT those 
systems are highly logical and succomb to a systematic diagnosis.  
The technician must be able to read well (and understand), have 
access to modern equipment eg 'scopes, gas analysis, and break-out 
boxes AND believe it or not, meet the public well.

This don't come cheap.  Equipment, tools, and training are bringing
the costs of running a top-notch repair shop into the realm of a
running a small clinic.  In fact, a good technician is closer to a
good physician in terms of comparison than anything else. 
Unfortunately, they are equally as rare.  If you find a good shop
but they charge $65 an hour, they will be worth it from an economic
standpoint alone in terms of the speed of their diagnosis and
ability to repair once, the first time.  It is money well spent if
it is a task that cannot be done by yourself.  In fact, i'll be
brash enough to say that this is also the place to get your everyday
stuff done (oil changes, belts, etc) as they may spot trouble and
bring it to your attention BEFORE it becomes major.  It is in their
best interest to drum up business for themselves and in your
interest to repair something before it leaves you stranded. 

The bad ones are slowly dying out.  But for now, consumers are left in the 
quagmire of well-trained techs and those not-quite-dead hacks.  You 
pays yer money and takes yer chances.  If you find a good one, pay 
'em and smile knowing it could be a whole lot worse.
