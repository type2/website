Subject:      Primary battery ventilation?

Howdy,

I just got a new primary battery installed.  A Sears Diehard
International.  The battery has a vent, but Sears didn't connect it
to anything, and it's not apparant to me where it would connect.

Where is the external vent connection for the primary battery?
Is it bad to leave the battery venting into the battery
compartment?
