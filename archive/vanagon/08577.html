So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Was _anybody_ able to properly view the ASCII file I posted yesterday?
&gt; I tried it on my PC, and it does work, although I had to edit a couple
&gt; of lines out to keep it from setting my terminal to 40 column mode.
&gt; (edit out the very first and last lines, and there is one in the middle
&gt; but ya gotta know how to find it)
&gt; 
&gt; On a VT100, VT220 or ansi terminal, it works perfectly!
&gt; 
&gt; At least the complaints here were not as bad as on the Posche list - I
&gt; got a zillion flames cause the wannabe techno-weenies with their AOL
&gt; accounts couldn't figure it out!


Well, I ran it on unix.  It runs pretty fast on a work station.  I've 
seen something similar about 8 years ago.  I like the train.  I wish
I new how to slow it down though.
