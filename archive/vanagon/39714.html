Subject: New German word invented! (nonvw)

In the thick of the (non)productivity of late Friday's work day a new German
word was invented.

Binderh=F6rder (bin-der-hor-der) noun |  def'n=3DThe person in every office=
 who
happens to have all of the office supplies when everyone else is without
supplies. Most typically a &quot;boss&quot; type with a dual PhD.

e.g. =3D &quot;That binderh=F6rder had dry erase markers of every color, but held=
 a
secret obsession for only the Jumbo paperclips.&quot;

If the o with the oomlaats didn't come out in your mail reader please edit
to insert ascii char (alt 0246)
