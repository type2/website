Subject: Dometic fridge helpers

I would like to thank all the people who gave input on how to troubleshoot my 
westies fridge unit. Turned out to be nothing more than a totally blocked jet 
.I cleaned it up and now I have a nice blue flame. I did'nt think it was going 
to be a big deal but it's always better to go into the unknown armed with a 
little knowledge. Thanks guys! Tom Czerniak   85 Westy
