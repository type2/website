Hi,

	I went to the neillo Porsche swap meet and concourse this morning.
Picked up a 050 distributor, with cap/rotor/condensor, etc. for $4

	Anyway, they have a 65/66ish bug out in the back.  Its tags expired
in 92.  Its all there except for the hood logo.  Bumpers, lights, 
everything.  No body rust that I could see.  It had bias ply tires,
one was getting low.  The interior is all there, orginal radio, hass all
the white knobs.  Kinda greyish/green in color, quite faded but intact.

	If you're interested, you might try contacting Neillo BMW/Porsche
and asking around, or if you're close to Sacramento, check it out yerself -
its on Fulton Ave between Marconi and Alta arden.

	No, this is not a dream!

	
Thom
