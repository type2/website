&gt; little out of date in the 1990's?

Ok, I'm gonna catch some flack for this, but...

I personally like the babes in bikini's. Yes, I'm a family man over 40, 
but I'm not upset at having to look at scantily clad women on every other 
page. Quite the contrary. 

I do however agree that the writing in these magazines are about 6th 
grade level and could be improved, but pleeeze, don't take away the babes!

Running for the hills now....
