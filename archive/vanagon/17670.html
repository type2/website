Subject: Left-over part?: starter re/re

Ok, so yesterday I *finally* got around to replacing the starter solenoid 
that packed it in after starting(?) the camper in -30 C temps in New 
Brunswick a couple of months ago.  Got sick of push-starting and 
strategic parking.

So I pull the starter, no prob, but I thought I heard something drop as 
I'm pulling the starter clear of the tranny case.  Hmmm...  Lying on my 
back, look around, I see nothing.  Crawl out, replace the solenoid with a 
new one, get ready to go back under the bus to reinstall the whole thing.

I see something lying on the ground.  It looks just like a 5/16ths ball 
bearing, nice and shiny, but with a threaded hole (maybe 2-3mm dia.) that's 
tapped about 3/4 of the way through the &quot;bearing.&quot;  None of the manuals I 
have (St. Muir, Bentley, Haynes) make any mention anything like this.

Did some vandal put it under the bus when I had my back turned just to 
screw me up?  Or is it really a part that belongs in there somewhere?  I 
couldn't find an obvious home for it, so I just pocketed it, finished the 
job and the bus starts and runs just fine.

Any ideas on what this thing is?  Does it belong to the bus at all?  Has 
somebody on alt.shenanigans tracked down my address and done me in good?
