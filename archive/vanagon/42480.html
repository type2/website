Subject: 82 Vanagon,  banshee front pads!

 Friends!   Problem-solvers!   Mechanics!   Lend me your ears!

        When my front pads wore down to the thickness of onion
skins, I replaced them with a Beck/Arnley set.  Talk about a
lot of noise!  My teenagers don't want to ride anywhere with me
because they are too embarrased to be seen by their friends in
such a screechmobile.  Talking with experienced hands, I was
told to &quot;buy a set of good quality German pads; then you won't 
have that problem.&quot;  Dutifully I went out and bought a set of
Pagid pads. Ok, so now it's not quite so shrill, but it's still bloody 
annoying. Coming home very late at night, I must creep in at slow
speed, then apply the hand brake to stop so as not to wake up
the entire neighbourhood! On the plus side, when I stop for a
pedestrian, he fairly hustles to the other side, not being entirely
certain that this tub is capable of stopping...............
         Do those dampening plates that go behind the pads do 
any good? Any brands of pads that brake noiselessly? Anyone 
out there have a solution, before I go completely deaf?  I'm 
learning sign language, just in case. I'm getting desperate 
enough to apply a thick coat of Vaseline to the rotors, just to 
get some peace and quiet.
