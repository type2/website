Subject: Re: Leaking Head Gasket

&gt;Bob,
&gt;
&gt;I had the headgasket problem with my 85.  VW picked-up the cost of
&gt;parts to replace the gasket twice and finally the head.  If I can
&gt;find my receipts, I think we also cut a deal on the labor.  I only
&gt;paid a percentage.

I've still got it with one side of my '85, when did VW 'honour' the warranty 
on yours? Canadian warranty was 2 year/100,000 Km, long gone.  thanks tim s.
