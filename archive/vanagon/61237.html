Subject: SEARCH &amp; RESCUE MUGS IN/OUT...

 Howdy all. I arrived home yesterday to find the Search &amp; Rescue mugs waiting.
I must say they look really good- count yourself lucky if you ordered one, as
they're all sold...
:)
Anyway, if you ordered ONLY a S&amp;R mug, OR a S&amp;R mug and a plastic mug, then you
should be getting them in the next week or so. If you ordered the ceramic 4-bus
design, then please bear with me, as I'm hoping to get them any day now...
Hopefully you folks that ordered just plastic mugs should get them now, as I
mailed them last week...
 Anyway, many thanks to those that ordered so far...Plenty of 4-bus ceramic
mugs and stickers just waiting to make you happy!
:)
THanks,
