I'm sure this has been asked before, but I was wondering what is the
highest mileage any of us has seen on a bus.  I don't care about
rebuilds, swapped trannys etc., just how many miles has the bus
traveled since it rolled off the showroom floor?

Sorry to the jokers out there, but I'm answering this in a semi serious way..

I met a mechanic,   whose shingle read &quot;Marginal Mechanical Repair&quot;,  out in
the desert in California.  He said he has worked on a local bus there for 20
years, for a guy who uses it as a delivery vehicle for work,  and  clocked up
a million and a quarter miles on it.  Of course, the motor and tranny have
been replaced...

BTW,  any other interesting repair shop names anyone has seen?  They seem
wierder in the back woods,   Why be normal and call it Dave's VW?
