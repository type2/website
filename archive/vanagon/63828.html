Subject: Nantahala (N.C.) Whitewater Rafting Campout!


Greetings Volks!

A group of us from Atlanta will be camping out this coming weekend, Aug.
16-18 at the Nanatahala Outdoor Center, North Carolina (see blurb culled
from their website below.)

We will be going whitewater rafting, canoeing and mountain biking! Hope
some of you can join us! If interested, email either Dave Easterwood or
Louise Christensen (loudesign_at_mindspring_dot_com).

It's supposed to be great weather!  There are still some spaces open for
rafting trips on Sunday (Saturday is all sold out), so if you are
interested, reservations go fast for the river trips. At last call to NOC,
there were spaces left at the 9 am departure, 11am departure (going
quickly) and then 4pm departure, I believe.  The river trip runs about
3.5-4 hours though mostly class II and III rapids... although they may seem
like 4 or 5!

We'll be doing a cook out on Saturday night, so c'mon out! (Rumor has it
there might also be key lime pies....) Hope to see you there!

The Shaconage, or &quot;place of the blue smoke&quot;, as theCherokee call it, is
