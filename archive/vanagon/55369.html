Subject: 1/87 Scale vanagons

For anyone interested my local hobbyshop, D+J in Campbell CA has all of
there ROCO Minitanks stuff at 50% off.  In addition to armor they have a
couple of Vanagon models too.  I got an od green single cab with US Army on
the doors and an ambulance for $11.  There also was a &quot;Follow Me&quot; airport
van with a checkerboard roof that I passed on. $6 is still pretty steep but
sometimes you just gotta get it.   E-mail me if you are interested and I'll
see if there are any more available.
