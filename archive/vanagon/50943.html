Subject: 1980 Westy Faucet Asssebly Needed

Hey! I'm looking for a faucet assembly for my friends 80Westy. And..I'm
just happy happy happy that this list exists.  My local dealer wants
$1,100 for a new driveshaft. Yikes!!  I'm currently debating(mostly with
myself) as to whether I should replace the U joints or go for the $450
driveshaft D Haynes has mentioned. Any comments are welcome. Sitting 2wd
in a foot of snow in Montana.
Thanks one and all.            Rob
