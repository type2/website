Subject:      question

Hey,

        I've got one you've never heard before - it's a Norcold question.

        I am a proud, 2 month owner of an '87 Westy replacement for my
venerable '78 Camper Bus (laid to rest _at_ 230k).

        Anyway, as the family gets excited about more Baja trips, the thought
of cold beer haunts me.

        I'll make this short - can anyone tell me honestly that this fridge
works as well on gas as on AC?

        It works fine on AC, and I just finished cleaning the jet and external
cooling fins. Still, the gas powered cooling seems pretty weak.

        If someone gives me some strand of hope, I will go ahead and add a
better fan to the back and a small one to the interior. Maybe even some
deflector sheets to channel air over the rear fins.

        Anyway, my fingers are crossed.

Thanks,
Brendan
