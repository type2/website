Subject: Re  N vs S CA

On 10/31/94, Martha wishes to classify herself:

&gt;flannel, WEST CALIFORNIA, air head (oops, I mean cooled)

Would this be the part of CA that falls into the Pacific and makes
Steven and Thom instant millionaires by making their homes beachfront
property with the next BIG ONE?

A quick note for David S. in SD (that would be San Diego, not the state):
When you put your itinerary together for the Bricks Across America thing,
you can label I-5 the &quot;CalCan Highway&quot;!  meow, meow, meow...
