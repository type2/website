Oh,oh,

Checked under the mighty road hoopty (84 GL) after smelling coolant, and
found that in one part by the rear of the bus right where the coolant pipes
bend up towards the engine bay, there is a small dripping leak through the
pipes. 
Question, I know the pipes are mucho $$$. What about sawing off the part
that has rusted out and replace it with a length of fleible tubiing or even pvc?
