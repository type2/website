Subject:      Vanagon puzzler solved! (?)

Some time ago I posed the following problem:

1. Van starts normally when cold.

2. When hot, just cranks, no firing.

3. Sometime will start if I open throttle all the way first.

4. Will start when I put it on BOTH batteries, causing it to crank just
a little bit faster.

Got answers all over the place.

Lived with the problem some more.  Then when poking around, trying to
figure out why it was running rich I noticed the idle screw was rather
far out even for having to run the AC.  Hmm... maybe the timing is off.
Retarded the timing and vola, the starting problem was solved!

What I still can't figure out is why.  We all know that if it fires too
early when starting it is hard to turn it passed TDC.  But in this case
it cranked just fine.  ???

Closest correct answer award goes to whoever said 'Check distributor'.
'Course, he went on to say check everything else, too.

Anyway, running fine now.  More insight appreciated.
