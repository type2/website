Subject: Re: New web page

&gt;Greetings all,
&gt;  I recently scanned in a bunch (87!) of Vanagon/Bus photos for an addition
&gt;to Skip's web page and wanted to know what kind of images you guys would like
&gt;to see.  The only older stuff is a bunch of images taken from a '66 Westfalia
&gt;brochure; the rest are all Vanagon related.  I have a shot of Oettinger's
&gt;WBX6 6-cyl. wasserboxer, some shots of Projekt Zwo's modified Vanagons
&gt;(Single/Double cab, Serious off-road Syncro Kombi), Kamei Eurovan, my '84
&gt;(will be posted regardless&lt;g&gt;), Color Syncro cutaway, Westy interior shots
&gt;and various other things copied from my brochure collection.  Let me know,
&gt;and I should have them posted within a week.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Ryan
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like you have some pretty cool pix. The six cyl Boxer and the Off
road Kombi sound good to me. Thanks for asking.
Todd Francis
