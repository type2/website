Subject: MISSED THE GASS SHOW ('71 Rustfalia tranny prob - fixed now tho') :-(
Date: Mon, 7 Jul 1997 14:44:06 -0400

Hi Mike and list,

Good to hear from you. Yep, my rustfalia failed me :-(  I was about 30
miles on the North side of Columbus, stopped to fuel and check things out
and the shifting got REAL sloppy, couldn't find any gears at all! It had
started feeling funky (at least more than usual :-) when driving my wife
back from Louisville, KY earlier in the morning, but I ignored it in my
anticipation to make it to the GASS show in time to catch Teddy Bear's
famous bratwurst. Removed the shifter hoping for something simple and not
finding it. Looked in the rear and all looked visibly fine. I had just
replaced the clutch and feared this the problem. Finally called AAA for a
tow. Had it towed to Bill Westerfield's shop who let me work on it there.
(BTW, if you're ever near Lawrenceburg, IN, Bill's a *GREAT* guy and even
better VW mechanic) Pulled the engine to get a better look at the tranny
and with some guidance from Bill (who am I kidding, a *LOT* of guidance!),
found the problem, replaced the &quot;hockey stick&quot;, and all was well. But it
was too late and I was too tired to drive to the GASS show, which I had
been looking forward to *ALL* year!! :-(

Anyway, sorry to all I was suppose to meet. If I could have called, I
would. Maybe I can catch you all at the Columbus show in August?? Or if
anyone wants to come down/up for the Cincinnati show, I'd be glad to host a
party at my place the night before and put anyone up??

On the plus side, I did get a chance to work more on my wife's plagued '86
and FIXED IT! More on this in a post to the vanagon list.

Sorry I missed everybody, figures the guy who made the stink wouldn't show
;-)

PS - the &quot;rustfalia&quot; is going to need a new name, getting a temporary &quot;cave
and pave&quot; and cheap paint job this week. (trading a body man neighbor the
job for violin lessons to his daughter) yeah, i know, flame me, but the '60
is getting all the $$ this year :-)

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Erik and list,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep! I'll be there!! I'll be arriving Saturday late afternoon/early
evening
&gt; and will be leaving Monday morning. I'll be in my white '71 Rustfalia
&gt; assuming all goes well with the new carb install. Been *REAL* busy and
&gt; haven't got around to it yet :-(  If not, I'll be in my wife's blue '86
&gt; weekender. But the '71 will have to be pretty darn bad before I show up
to
&gt; a GASS show in a waterboxer ;-&gt; Just kidding, really!
&gt; 
&gt; I'd love to get a list camp sight together! Ted Finesman
(tedebare_at_aol_dot_com)
&gt; will there in his white/tan '75 standard on Friday. I'm sure I could get
&gt; him to save some spots for us.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a good possibility that some of the Marshwiggles will be there with
me
&gt; too. So if any other musicians are going to be there, maybe we could have
a
&gt; campfire jam? Todd Swangstu of CampBox News *promised* me to show up with
a
&gt; guitar. He's a great guitar player! Look for my '71 Rustfalia and Ted's
&gt; nice white/tan '75 with &quot;Tri-Transporter&quot; signs. Also, look for an
upright
&gt; bass with &quot;American Gothic&quot; painted on the back, that'll be me!
&gt;

&gt; &gt; If anyone's interested, I'm trying to figure out who is going to be at
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; G.A.S.S. show in Columbania, Oh next weekend. I've compiled a list of
&gt; who's
&gt; &gt; going to be there and when, that I know of, it's listed below. First,
the
&gt; &gt; listing of show info from the G.A.S.S. site....

lately]
&gt; &gt; Tony M &amp; friends  ?????
&gt; &gt; Susan S (88' Westy) Sunday
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's all I know of right now. If you're in the area let someone know
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; stop by. The N.E. Ohio area is not that big on VW vans, so this is one
of
&gt; &gt; the few important events of the year for us. Tony M mentioned something
&gt; &gt; about getting a little section together at the show for listmembers.
