&gt;First, let me tell you what I'm calling a &quot;flat spot.&quot; Symptom: Bus idles 
&gt;fine. Accelerates while cold. Once she warms up, will only accelerate 
&gt;when I give her gas GRADUALLY.

This sounds like a problem with your accelerator pump on your carb
to me.  The accelerator pump squirts a little extra gas down the
throat of the carb.  If it pumps too much, it will momentarily
flood and &quot;stall&quot;.  If it doesn't pump enough, your engine has to
build momentum from the other components of the carb in conjuction
with either the vacuum or centrifugal advance of the distributor.

&gt;... This also could be (I hope) due to
&gt;some slightly stiff components on the carb (specifically, the throttle
&gt;valve lever, which doesn't always return completely).

There are basically two systems that affect your problem: the 
ignition system and the fuel system.  You have pretty much
eliminated the ignition problems.  If you have KNOWN problems
with the fuel system, those are the problems to fix FIRST.

BTW the accelerator pump diaphram is included in the carb rebuild
kit.

Good Luck,

Dave
