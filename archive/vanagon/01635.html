Subject: A plea...

I really appreciate the gobs of info that come out of this list, but as I
only log on a few times a week, I find myself overwhelmed by the 30-50
messages that I find. Could a make the following plea?

    Please don't include the text of the message you're replying to,
    this list is so active I'm sure we all have it in our inboxes still.
    If you feel we wouldn't how about a brief summary instead?

Mucho thanks, Tim
