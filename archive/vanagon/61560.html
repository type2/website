Subject: Re: preventing theft

My '83 camper installed its own anti theft devise!  It simply stopped
engaging the starter.  I ran a wire from the battery to the starter, put
a starter button on top of the battery cover, (OPPS!  now I told you!)
and covered that with the carpet.

I'd like to see 'em try to steal it!  Bring a tow truck!
