Subject: Re: fix the plug!!!

&gt;If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  That cylinder could easily be worse off
&gt;after you 'fix' it.  Inserts often leak and the metal shards you'll
&gt;inevitably get in the engine will not be helpful.  Although at least # 2 is
&gt;easier to get to, on my engine.

That was my thought.  I had the engine stripped down to the long block, and 
applied heat, WD40, and everything else I could think of.  I couldn't get it 
to budge.  I'm not going to try to do anything about it until I have to.  

In response to those who said that the life of the plug depends on many 
things: I might add that the compression is 130-135 all around, and I 
replaced the other plugs with platinums.  The motor burns very little oil, 
like less than a quart every 2000 miles.  It leaks a couple of drops too.
