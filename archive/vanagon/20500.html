So COPICH_at_calvin.cc.duq_dot_edu says:
&gt; Vanagon owners!
&gt; 	I'm relatively new in the vanagon scene but I've noticed
&gt; with many of the vanagons that the ...I'm not sure what they are
&gt; called...maybe support struts that hold up the back hatch have
&gt; been under designed.  They must go bad after about 7 years.
&gt; It was interesting to see the creative ways of proping   ping up that
&gt; deADLY hatch.  I'm currently using a tomato stake.  Anyway
&gt; is there or has there been anything designed to replace
&gt; these wimpy struts?  

Well... as an alternative to the deluxe stick in the hatch routine, here's
an exerpt from a previous posting about a place that had those shocks on
sale:

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the place they're talkin' about.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; anybody out there want to call and see whether this is just hype??
&gt; 
&gt; They gave me a price quote of $29 each for the Vanagon.
