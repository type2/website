Subject: Vanagon 1.9L seized
Date: Wed, 11 Sep 1996 22:38:48 +0000

I bought an 1984 Vanagon with a seized(?) engine.  I got a tow home and have
been reading Bntley and lurking ever since.  I dismantled the engine and
discovered much sludge and not a drop of oil to drain at the plug or oil
filter. When I took off the oil filler tube from the crankcase out poured
clean oil.  I split the case and found a piston rod seized to the
crankshaft.  I called the local (Portland, OR) auto salvage yards and found
no replacement engine.  I did find an 1983 1.9L core for $250.  They said I
had just missed a &quot;runner&quot; sold for $550.  I now have the 1983 salvage
engine core dismantled as well.  I found head and valve damage in cyl. #1.
I hoped not to have to split the 1983 case, but there was excessive
crankshaft endplay(?), and my concern of the impact the cyl #1 valve damage
(the rocker assembly shaft was bent and the push rod loose to the side under
the valve cover) had on the camshaft, bearings and case.

I phoned Camelback Volkswagon (from vanagon archives
&quot;A-Few-Parts-Suppliers&quot;) for parts price quotes.  Is there a better source
for quality replacements for the following?

head gasket set
main bearings
rod bearings
camshaft and bearings
piston rings
distributor drive gear
water pump
pushrod tubes
flywheel crankshaft seal
muffler and clamp
exhaust pipe
C.V. boot
brake shoes
right and left rear hatch struts
passenger side mirror

Should anything else be replaced/done while the engine is out for a strong
rebuild?  
Is it OK to combine crankshaft shims from both engines or should I buy new
shims?
Should I replace the pilot bearing in the crankshaft that mates with the
automatic transmission?
I plan to reuse the piston rods unless I find excessive wear.  Is it OK to
reuse the rod nuts and bolts?
Is it OK to reuse the valve lifters with the new camshaft if they pass the
Bentley check for wear?
I have a sears click type(?) torque wrench.  Bentley says not to use click type.
Is this critical?

Last but not least, these heads.  Could these heads be OK after 120K-130K miles?
I removed some of the valves and have valve/guide wear within tolerance.

I am not sure you can classify me as a Vanagon owner yet for stats, but I am
a Vana-Want-to-Be.

Thanks,
