Hi Steve,

&gt; Can anyone give me a clue on:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.) Where's the d*mned tank,
&gt; 2.) How do I get to the electrical connector on the float sensor,
&gt; 3.) Has anyone has this problem on a Vanagon, who might be able to
&gt;     suggest a possible cause (sticky float? Gauge problem? etc.)?

Answers:
1. The d*mned tank is behind the d*maned spare tire.
2. To get to the d*mned connector you have to drop the d*mned tank.
2a. To get to the d*mned connector you have to cut a hole in the floor 
(not recommended).
3.Yes, we have.  Possible causes are:
a. bad float.
b. poor connections.
c. bad sending unit.
d. bad gauge.
e. adjustment tabs bent incorrectly.
f. none of the above (there'll be a quiz on Friday).

Jack

PS -- I have a post that I can repost on dropping and reinstalling the 
tank, if requested.
