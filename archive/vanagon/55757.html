Subject: Re: Needed - EV Oil Filters

&quot;Pete&quot; S. inquired:

&gt;getting oil filters for the Eurovan in bulk or from some source (mail
&gt;oreer) OTHER than a VW($) dealer and saving a few bucks.

Pete, can't help you out w/ a place that has the OEM Mann
or Mahle EV filters for cheap, but in a pinch, if your FLAPS
carries WIX filters, ask the guy at the counter for the filter
that would fit a full-size Ford truck; it's the same one for
the EV.  I don't recall what the model number is off the top
of my head, but if you need it, let me know.

I've been using the above filter (as well as the OEM filter) 
for my oil changes and I've been pretty happy w/ it.  I usually
pick them up for about $8, which I guess is a little less than
the dealer's OEM filter.

Good luck.

Norman
