Subject: Heat Tabs on AVP Rebuilds

This is for all fellow travelers with AVP engines. Seems they put
heat tabs on the block to check if the engine has been overheated.
To find yours, take of the stone guard on the bottom drivers side
of the engine. It is located on the drivers side of the block,
alomost at the bottom (not underneath) and in front of the screw
hole for the tin. It's about the size of a dime, with what looks 
almost like a spot of solder in the center. If you can see the
spot of metal, it's OK. If it looks like there is a whole in the
center, you've overheated the engine. Just thought you would like
to know.
