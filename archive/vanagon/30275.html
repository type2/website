hi there,
	just as a suggestion...  i have had this problem before too.
i noticed it most when it was raining, so i thought perhaps water was
getting into my fuel line, or even rust somewhere blocking.  but two
weeks ago it got REALLY bad and my entire engine shutdown, first
slowly losing power then none, a chugging and a lugging the whole way.
turned out my alternator finally kicked the bucket.  when i went to
replace it i saw that three of the four lines that leave the
alternator to go their various ways were in terrible shape and
exposed.  my theory is that they would short or ground out, causing a
momentary loss of power.  i replaced all the wires and the alternator
(boy what a story that was:) and things are looking great.  on my
first highway drive i looked down at the spedometer and 70MPH!!!!
within moments of getting on and switching to fourth.  (yes, i quickly
backed off)  but more importantly, haven't noticed a chug-a-lug since.

hope this helps.

take care,
	brandy
