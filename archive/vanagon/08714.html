As Maria and I always suspected, Type 2
owning/shopping/fixing/improving/driving/pushing/camping/loving folks are
a really fun, kind, and very social species. It was a pleasure meeting all
of you! 

Everybody took lots of pictures and it is my understanding that some will
be posted on the net. We got Bob and Bradley's splitwindows, Dave and
Patrick's breadloaves, and Martha and Jim's vanagons. Bill drove his sexy
Corrado VR6.  (While waiting for his even sexier singlecab to be fixed
up!)

Let's do this again!

Merry X-mas and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
