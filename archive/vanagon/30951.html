&gt; should try ?  

You could try the only thing that worked for me when all else failed, 
crank the spring on the AFC (if you have one, Bo don't know 84s) a few 
clicks tighter.  I sweated, strained and checked every component on the 
engine, including having the AFC tested by Bosch and that was the only 
action that got it to pass.
