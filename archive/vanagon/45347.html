Subject: Splitty Deluxe Skylight Tint?

Another newbie 20+ Window owner question:  Being up close and personal 
with only a few Sunroof Deluxes I just now noticed that the skylights in 
my '64 are tinted a dark green, while the ones in the '63 are clear.  Is 
this a difference in year models or an option?  If an option, does it 
have an M-Code?  TIA.

Still looking for an answer to the sunroof slider lube Q and a source for 
original style (hook/eyelet) seatbelts...
