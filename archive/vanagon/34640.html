&gt; &gt;I would agree with fixing rather than waiting for the gaskets to blow.
&gt; &gt;Granted, not all engines are the same, but we had a 63 Buick with a V-6
&gt; &gt;(cast iron, not alluminum) that, when it blew a head gasket, the increased
&gt; &gt;pressure of coolant leaking into one of the cylinders while it was running
&gt; &gt;at freeway speed literally pounded a hole through a piston.  Even if that
&gt; &gt;didn't happen in the Vanagon, I'd be worried about the hammering of the Rod
&gt; &gt;bearing by this increase in pressure (if the leak is INTO the cylinder,
&gt; &gt;that is).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The haed gaskets that leak coolant on a Vanagon are entirely different than
&gt; the head gaskets on most other &quot;normal&quot; cars.  A &quot;normal&quot; head gasket (like
&gt; on a Jetta or Eurovan) does dual duty in sealing both the combustion chambers
&gt; and the coolant passages.  The Vanagon head gaskets that leak only do the job
&gt; of keeping the coolant inside the engine.  Compression sealing is seperate on
&gt; a Vanagon and not generally suspetible to leaks like the coolant gasket.
