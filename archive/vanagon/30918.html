Subject: Smokin' 'n' leakin' !

Well, Scarecrow ('79) is not smoking in a major way any more but when I
stopped today and opened up the access door I did notice a little bluish oil
smoke coming from below the fan.  It looked like leakage from the oil
dipstick, dribbling down past the fan where it was cooking.  Probably easily
taken care of.

A bigger worry is the amount of oil leaking I'm getting.  After parking at
home, I noticed a trail of dime-sized oil spots behind the Bus showing where
I had driven it, still wet.  Underneath, a spot of leakage (from last night
and today) more than a foot square.  Is this even too much leakage for a
Bus?  (I checked the level and it doesn't seem unusually low, but you can be
sure I'll be keeping a close eye on it for a while.)
