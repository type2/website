Subject: Catalytic heaters

Hi,

I went to that web page which has the pictures of the catalytic
heater.....I have a few concerns with I do not understand.

First of all, the combustion exhaust is a plastic tube which points
down in the wheel well.

The exhaust will be a hot gas which will tend to rise, not go around a
down corner, unless it was somehow propelled that way. Has anyone
researched how to make one of those catalytic heaters exhaust
correctly? Do they all have an exhaust or does one just build an
airtight space for the burner to send the CO2.

The feed to the thing was propane copper pipe exposed in the wheel
well, would this not get beaten up by rocks on gravel roads? I live at
the end of a 350KM long one.

These are just concerns which I am wondering if anyone else has
answered.
