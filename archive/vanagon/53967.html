I too had this problem on my 87 syncro.  turns out after a while of this
problem the pigtail wire from the starter to the solenoid burned up.  I
took the starter apart, but was unable to figure out how to repair that
wire.  225 later I had a new starter in.  
ps A good wrench to have is a sawed off shortie offset 13mm wrench for the
battery connection to the starter.
