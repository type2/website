Subject: Re:  Cat smell

&gt;        Paul writes about getting animal smell out of a Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;        Nature's Miracle enzime pet smell remover. Not cheap, $7/pint,
&gt;buy it at the good pet stores. White plastic bottle with red printing.
&gt;Cured unaltered male cat urine smell in a matress I own. (He's alterned
&gt;now, but we've become friends...) Follow the directions- spray it on,
&gt;sponge in if necessary, wait two weeks before you decide if you need
&gt;a second application.

        And if you're not sure where the cat did the deed, get a black
light. The urine spots will glow. I worked for a pet shop for 2 years, and
we rented a black light for 3 days free with purchase of Nature's Miracle.
It was the only product we recomended for the job, although we carried a
few other brands. Never had a bottle of Nature's Miracle returned. Almost
never sold the other garbage.

Peace,
