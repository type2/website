To locate one source for Waxoyl try:
http://www.classicar_dot_com/vendors/nwimpprt/NIPCAT3.HTM  Scroll down a bit.  Jim

&gt;which reminds me: i think that stuff is called Waxoyl (or something that
&gt;sounds like that) and you CAN buy it and spray it back under the bus and
&gt;into the cavaties (like suspension arms and so forth). but where to get it,
&gt;i don't know. :(
