Subject: Reputable/Affordable body work in Central OH?

	Hi :
School loan check has come in, and I'm looking for a reputable body shop
in the Columbus area for repair of the rusted area under my battery. The
engine compartment ought be contained, right? Or at least not ventilating
from underneath! Can anyone recommend such a shop or individual?
