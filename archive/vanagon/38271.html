Subject: heater cable snap

&gt; {Charlie snapped his heater cable}

Real solution: go buy a heater cable and thread it. This could be easy 
or hard depending on the condition of your tubes and the sharpness of the 
turns. (I'd try to avoid it...)

Quick solution: Crawl under the bus. Look for two big tubes that leave 
the front of your engine on each side of the trans. Find the heater 
control box and wire the boxes permanently open. (Have someone play with 
the controls to help you find'em...) Obviously, you need to undo your 
handiwork when summer arrives.

Best solution: Lift up the back seat of your Beetle (yes, I said Beetle). If 
you have heater ducts under there, check the cables that go to them. My 
ducts had these sweet little cable connectors that allowed one to insert 
two ends of a solid cable and fasten them with two screws, thereby 
connecting two cables... Steal one of those and put it in your Bus.

Contact me if you don't know how the heater boxes actually work...

Good luck.
