Subject: A SILVER SOCKET SALUTE!!!

Hey People, 
  Thanks to all for letting me know I am out there.  Please forgive me 
boss man, I didn't mean to break the list rules.  I was just confused for 
a while, but I've seen the light!
  Whoever told me to search the gopher archives...thanks!  I never 
dreamed there was soooooo much info about the silver socket!  I know now 
where to look first for important things.  Thanks for the info once again!
