Subject: Lousy idle and sneaky booster leaks
Date: Fri, 13 Jan 95 9:12:34 PST



Over the past month or two vacuum leaks in or around the brake booster have 
been mentioned several times as cause for poor running or no running at all. I 
think these problems have been easily and inexpensively repaired, _once they
were found_. The difficulty with the diagnosis, IMHO, is that it's counter-
intuitive to look for a problem up near the left front wheel whose symptoms
are displayed in the engine compartment. 

Now if it is counter-intuitive to look for these leaks up at the left front 
wheel on a breadloaf it is going to be a downright leap-of-faith to start 
rooting around behind the dashboard of a Vanagon looking for a cracked or
loose hose, hissing booster, etc..

I mention this thought because I know someone with a Vanagon posted recently
with idle problems. If they haven't fixed it yet, it might be worthwhile to
pop off that dash nacelle and have a little look around.
