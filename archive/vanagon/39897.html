I knew I'd leave something out. That other post just wasn't long enough. :^)

One listmember asked if the flywheel was bolted on correctly by the PO.
He suggested that, with six bolts holding it on, there might be six
different positions it could be installed, if no indexing means was
provided, resulting in the heavy edge pointing the wrong way relative
to the internal engine imbalance.

Well, I forgot to mention that those six bolts are in a not-quite-
symmetric  pattern. Two of them are slightly farther apart than the
rest, so there *is* only one way it could go on. It was an excellent
question, though.


Another poster asked if I was considering losing the V6 and going back
to a Type-4.
