&lt;&lt; What's all the talk of a VW club run by VW that gives a 15% discount.  I
 looked on the VWoA wab sight and couldn't find any mention.  It sound
 like a good deal.

This is a deal with the Twin Cities (Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota)
Volkswagen Club and three of the four area VW dealerships.  There is also a
10% VW Club discount with some of the area FLAPS.  So far this has saved me
enough to pay for the membership for about the next 8 years.
