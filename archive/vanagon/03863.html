Does anyone have any sage advice about using engine cleaners just before
an oil change? Would they be harmful for an aircooled engine? Necessary?
Any advice is appreciated.

Also there was a very lengthy and informative posting on teflon and zinc
additives  for air-cooled engines (motorcycles) on rec.autos.tech. If
anyone caught it and knows how to reproduce it for this group, that would
be great. The main conclusion was that not only are they ineffective but
also harmful. DC--
