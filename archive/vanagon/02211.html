Subject: Re: gasoline differences. :) you should never have asked!

If you really want to get technical it would be necessary to rank order 
the companies by mpg and c/mi and then graph the results along the x and 
y axis. Thus for example UNOCAL 87 may be the cheapest but it also offers 
the least mpg by a full 1 mpg. That's why I picked the two middle rangers 
in both categories namely shell and AMOCO. Granted the differences are 
miniscule for one lonely bus but for 150 busses that's quite a difference, 
for a city, a state,  a country, a world?


In reality though everything converges toward the mean so it probably 
doesn't make that big a difference.....DC
