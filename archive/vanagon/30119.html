&gt;or two off LOOK at it is it worth the money asked? really now meditate on it
&gt;and/or if the seller doesn't let you do all this then I would'nt buy it.  

oh yeah!  i went to look at a bug and i wanted to check the
compression.  the owner said no way was he going to let me take a
spark plug out, as well as a few other things.  so i had to tell him
there was no way i was going to consider giving him any money.  he got
mad, i laughed and we went our seperate ways.
