Subject: '87 Alternator Voltage &amp; Oil light

Vanatics,
I discovered an odd relationship last week. 
This information pertains to 1986 to 1991 Vanagons.  Perhaps the 83-1/2 to 85
also.

Short version: 
Too high an alternator voltage can cause the oil pressure light to come on.

Long version:  
After replacing the engine in my 87 a while back, the oil pressure light came
on steady a couple of times.  After reading Bentley and doing some tests of
my own, I figured out that this was not caused by low oil pressure, and in
fact there is no condition in a properly working oil pressure monitoring
system that would cause the oil pressure light to come on steady.  When it
does come on, it should always blink. Well, the problem with the light went
away about a month ago.  That is until last week...

I was out doing a few errands, going from store to store and after my last
stop I noticed how &quot;nice &amp; bright&quot; the instrument lights looked, and oh, by
the way, the OIL LIGHT is ON AGAIN!  Having only traveled about 3 parking
spaces, I stopped the van and checked the oil.  It was O.K.  I started the
van again and the oil light was still on.  Now I noticed how &quot;nice &amp; bright&quot;
my headlights were.  The apparent cause: a faulty voltage regulator or
alternator since the only thing that could cause the light brightness is too
much voltage, and the only things that could cause too much voltage are the
alternator and/or the voltage regulator.  I drove the one mile home while
looking intently at the oil light and after a couple of minutes the oil light
went off and the lights returned to their normal intensity.

The next day I checked things out.  The alt/vr was putting out 13.86volts,
making a bit of a rattling sound and the oil light was not on.  I pulled out
the voltage regulator and one of the brushes (well, they're called that in a
motor - I don't know their name in an alternator) was oddly worn on it's side
and worn significantly more worn on the end than the other brush.  Given the
sound of the alternator I decided to replace the whole thing.

I called around for a 90Amp alternator &amp; found:
VW dealer rebuilt: $340.
FLAPS 1 rebuilt: $150.
FLAPS 2 rebuilt: $130.
FLAPS 3 rebuilt: $250. - they say rebuilt by Bosch
FLAPS 1 rebuilt: $112. - with a lifetime warranty (they obviously don't know
how long I plan to have this van!)

I got the $112. one, installed it and it made 14.2 volts.  Went on a 600 mile
trip this weekend and all is good.

I haven't looked at the oil light wiring diagram yet, but I figure there must
be some voltage at which a diode allows power to get to this LED, which is
not normally present but at 16?, 18?, 20? volts makes the LED glow.  The
reason that I hadn't caught on to the alternator problem before was that all
of the previous &quot;oil light-on&quot; instances had happened during the daytime, and
I didn't have any lights on to lead me down the &quot;too much voltage&quot; road.

So, the moral of the story is: If your oil pressure light glows steady,
suspect the alternator and/or voltage regulator.
