Try putting on new belts cuz I have a 300 watt amp in my van my battery went
dead all the time and I thought it was just the stero but once I replaced my
belts for the altenator it charged perfectly and holds for hours now....Just
a thought ...or you could try on the outside of the altenator is a black
piece with the little flints or whatever that move back and forth there bout
40 bucks but definitally make it charge better...
