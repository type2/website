Subject: '89 Westy 3000 miles(Boulder,Colo.)


Hi all,
	I went into the dealership this afternoon and the Westy had been
moved around back and marked sold:(  I took a look at it anyway, this time
in the daylight, and realized that this car simply could not have only
3000 miles on it.  It is in very good condition, but not that good. And it
is from North Dakota! How far is ND from Boulder?  And the tires are not 
O.E. and look like they have been far more than 3000 miles.So I tell all
this to the salesman who says that he is sure it only has 2992 miles on
it.  To make a much too moronic story short...the salesman, after I show
him repair bills I found in the glovebox showing 8961 miles says, &quot;Well
this model had it's odometer replaced at 89K miles.&quot; As if he did not
remember denying it??  At this I couldn't help but start laughing.  What
kind of clowns are these salespeople?  So I decided to get in my car and
go to talk to the clown across the street who wants to sell me a Syncro
Westy with an automatic locking rear differential:)

Boulder, Colorado...Nestled between the mountains and reality;)

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question about the Syncro...and I
am sorry for any unnecessary excitement the &quot;3000&quot; mile Westy may have
created.

Cory
