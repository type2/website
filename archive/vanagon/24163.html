&gt; To me, it doesn't look too serious.  However, I do need to buy two new 
&gt; floor sections (about $220.00 from Wolfsburg West).  

Don't get them there!  They prolly won't fit!  I know all the sections I
got from them needed a ot fo &quot;engineering&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot; and &quot;adjustement&quot;
in order for them to fit!

Try Das Bulli Haus, they're in Connecticut.  I don't have the number
handy, tho - anyone?
