Subject: Re: Fuel Usage


Wow I'm pretty psyched, my '76 Bus FI with 218K miles gets
a little over 20 mpg!  I was wondering if that was any good
but it looks like it's as good as the ones made in the 90's.

I need to count miles because my fuel gauge doesn't work
:-).  I can get a little over 300 miles from a 15 gallon
tank.  I last filled up at 18453, so I need to fill up again
before 18753 :-).
