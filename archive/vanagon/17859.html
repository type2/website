&gt; The only other bad thing is a nasty
&gt;spare-tire sized dent in the nose, where someone left it in gear, and it
&gt;smacked a wall with the mounted spare tire.
&gt;  Soooooooooo, I guess my first question is, what's the best way to pull
&gt;such a dent? Although the bus came with an extra nose, welding that on
&gt;seems to be a tremendous project, for which I don't think I'm ready. 

I'm no expert autobody repair man, however I have dabbled in a little. I had 
to get a &quot;deer dent&quot; hammered out to straighten the headlight on my 79.  I 
was able to hammer from the inside after removing the panels and windshield 
washer bottle.  The only tools I had were a carpenters claw hammer and a 
piece of wood.  The trick is to take your time and realize you can't do any 
more damage with the hammer than the offending wall did.
