Subject: Eddie sings

Hey now,
        I know that since all of you found out that I sing opera, you've
been dying to hear me...  ;-)   This is now possible, through the miracles
of the computer. All hail the mighty machine!! I did my Jr. Recital last
week, and had it recorded and mastered on CD (the guy that owns the studio
used to borrow my bus about once a week for mobile gigs, so I had a
connection). So, I took two samples from the CD master, converted to AIFF
mono files and popped 'em on my web page. Just surf to

http://ccwf.cc.utexas_dot_edu/~ehintz

and let me know what you think. And I promise I won't sing opera in Inuvik
unless specifically reqested to do so...   ;-)

Peace,
