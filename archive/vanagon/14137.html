Howdy,
	
	Well, my baby is still progressing, slowly.

	Welded the engine lid hold-up in this weekend, but welded it in 
backwards!  D'oh!  Oh well, it will still work...  And I would seriously
thrash it trying to cut it back off - can you say &quot;penetration?&quot;  I _knew_
you could!

	I also picked up a set of engine lid hinges at the junkyard, off of
a '67 camper (STRIPPED!) - someone had taken the engine lid and left the
hinges laying on the ground!  These hinges are all but impossible to find,
it seems.

	Tonight I'll continue with the bodywork, and I have a set of bumpers
on the way, so all in all its coming together nicely!

Thom
