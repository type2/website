Subject: Re: VW's Volkswagen Club

Just FAXed in my registration Wednesday due to an impending visit for a full
30k maintenance and lookover of my &quot;new&quot; '91. Wanted to insure that my dealer
here had a good feel for this Westy shipped back from the dealer in MN.

I had checked that they were &quot;participating&quot; prior to joining. When I got there
the service manager knew nothing about it, the parts manager did. After the
$345 service/parts was done I asked how the 15% discount worked. Since they
really didn't know and &quot;had no info&quot; they agreed to run me through the computer
with the 10% senior dsct on the whole thing. What a NICE surprise . . . they
give seniors a 10% dsct on EVERYTHING! Even if they didn't give me 15% - they
noted they gave me th 10% and said that they would ckeck into the &quot;rules&quot; of
the program and if it should have been 15% they will add the 5% later. I have
a sneaky suspision that they probably won't do 15% on everything, but the $39
I did save this time more than paid for the membership.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone joined the Volkswagen Club from VW? They offer a whole bunch
&gt; of benefits that seem like it might be worth the $25. The parts discount
&gt; is the one that stands out the most (even thought I hardly ever buy
&gt; parts from the dealer) Any thoughts/experiences?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Dave
