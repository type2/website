&gt; Anyone any advice on doing this in a vanagon.  The '85 crewcab has zero

&gt; it's half the volume of a regular van.  I need to insulate the roof, but

&gt; Any thoughts on insulation?  Leaning towards fibreglass house stuff, but a

 Tim,

    In the stores this time of year you can find a foam tape. 
    It's 12&quot; wide, by about .25&quot; thick, by.. I think 20 feet.
    It's siver Aluminum on 1 side. I found this to be light,
    and a very good insulator. It's expensive, but I would pay 
    more for it! I used this in my old car. Made the car fell
    better than new cars.

    The only problem is you must remove your head liner to intall.
