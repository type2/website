Subject: Yosemite, anyone?

Hi all,

I'll be camping in Yosemite the week between Monday, Dec. 26 and December 
30, taking pictures and playing in the snow.

If anyone else on the list is planning to be there during this time, let me 
know so we can meet, swap Vanagon stories, and watch our breath freeze. 
I'll give any list members free photography instruction just to have some 
company.
