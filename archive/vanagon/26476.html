Subject: Re: Vans in europe?

For comparison. It costs us 900.00US to ship a car from Palo Alto to
Buffalo. This is a much greater distance and we could pack the car with
everything we had. Of course the car did not go by ship down through the
panama canal (a man a plan a canal -panama!) but by truck in 2.5 days no less!

The idea of buying into a time share van to use in Europe intrigues me. It
sounds like a great idea. Earlier I had mentioned something along those
lines but instead we would fly into destinations where people on the list
live - use their van for a holiday and return. The understanding is of course
that this would be a mutual swap so both sides would benefit. In other
words, if ther was someone from say Germany on the list we could arrange
for them to use our Westy to see Canada and vice versa.
