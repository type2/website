Well, I am new to this but...
1965
split window
originally from Germany
asking $2800
interior gone
no rag roof
no windows on roof
no corner windows in back
13 or 15 window I think
bench front seat (not walk trough)
Southern California

I think that means Kombi, right?
----------

a kombi has three windows each side behind the doors.  It did not come with a
head liner.   It came with hard board grey panels on the roof of the drivers
area.  if it has nothing there- look at the side of the ventilation box on
the roof.  if there is agroove, its for the panel to slide into.  If there
are little teeth, its to hold the headliner - microbus 221 .  If it has
aluminium trim around the beltline, and extra side windows it's a deluxe.
   241 

kombi's  came one tone on the outside, with the front interior metal the same
colour.  The rear was primer grey.  The seats were held in wit wingnuts, not
17mm nuts.  The middle seat was an option, not standard, and no interior
panels were installed.    231 

Do you mean by from Germany that it has two tone taillights and bumpers
without overriders?  Does it have a steering lock?   Those are pretty nifty

So, this thing runs really well, right?  Stops well, all lights work,   and
the steering wheel doesnt slop.   for that price i'd expect a bus i could use
as a daily driver.

BTW, inspect the rockers with a fine tooth comb- if there are pin holes it's
not too solid.  It'll come through.  Pull up the floor mat in front.  Are
there tell tail rust water marks down each side of the dash?

happy bussing
