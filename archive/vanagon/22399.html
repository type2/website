Subject: idle question 2.1


 does anyone know the secret for getting a 2.1 wasserboxer to idle
 smoothly... I have done just about everything i can think to do..
 checked the CO, replaced O2 sensor, set timing at 2200 rpms with temp
 sensor 2 disconnected and the idle stab. disconnected. and also
 when i set the CO it was done properly, O2 sensor discon. and idle stab
 discon. with ignition off.. etc...
 
 it seems to idle good until i reconnect the 02 sensor...
 has anyone been able to devise a way to get the motor to idle smoothly?
 i have been told that these motors tend to idle rough, but this is
 generally info from dealer mechanics who usually do not know the
 special needs of the vanagon... I see this as a big problem with the
 service that the vanagon received from the the dealers... it seems that they
 never got the support they needed to do the work 100% this most likely
 due to the fact that the vanagon wasn't exactly as a big seller as the
 high quality fox, etc...

 i forgot tto mention that i also checked the throttle switches
 checked all electrical connections and did a fill pin out check
 of the wiring harness...

 so, i just want to throw this out and see if anyone has had
 this problem and if anyone has been able to solve it...

 later, Patrick
