Subject: junkyard excursion /was Re: DaBoat 2-liter update - bad heads :(

 The seats are
&gt;normally $30 each, but are currently 25% off.  Please don't ask me to go
&gt;get these seats and ship them to you - I don't have the time. :(  I will be
&gt;happy to provide the location though, if anyone wants to email me.

     I'd be interested, planning any other excursions out
     there (Otay Mesa Road?) after you get this engine
     assembled and running?
