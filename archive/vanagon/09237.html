Regarding Tom's van:
&gt; Reasonable offer not refused

Alright, I'll be the jerk (why change now?) and ask-- just what are 
YOU considering as a starting 'reasonable' offer?  I ask this not 
because I'm gonna drive to SF to get a van but in the strictest sense 
of the academic pursuit of knowledge (I'm looking at buying an '87 in 
MN). 

We're all friends, here, so you can tell us (chortles and guffaws).  
Be Brave.
