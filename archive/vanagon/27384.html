&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the meantime, since I was raring to go camping, I'm sort of
&gt; &gt; thinking it would be fun to do maybe a one nighter this weekend
&gt; &gt; somewhere locally near the bay area.  Any takers?

&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I'm game.  Put me down for one one nighter with Martha.  I will 
&gt; need more than a few days to get out there so maybe a raincheck would 
&gt; be in order.  I will bring flannel.  :)
