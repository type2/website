Subject: Water in My Wasserboxer

My '85 camper has never run well since I bought it over 18 months ago.  I have stuck with it because I love 
driving it when it is running.  I recently replaced the engine and gas tank and it runs great until I drive it 
in the rain.  Large amounts of water enter the gas tank and I need advice on how to stop it.  I have taken the 
tank out and sealed all the openings and clamped all the lines I can think of.  

Is there something I'm missing? Splashguards for the inside of the fender would help?
