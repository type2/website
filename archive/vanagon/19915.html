Subject: Re: Muffler question



Hi folks

I have an 82 Vanagon that is in need of a muffler. The question that I 
have is there is a little pipe on the muffler that is rusted through it 
is on the passenger side of the van. Now is this little pipe part of the 
muffler, it is about as big as a little finger, or is it going to be more 
than a muffler? It is about 2 inches long. Sorry to be so vague but it is 
hard to explain. 

Jared
