Subject: Vanagon TD: left motor mount

Thanks to Brent, I have just learned that the Quantum 1.6 TD manifold and
turbo fits in a non-turbo Vanagon diesel with no modification of the
standard left-side motor mount.  This manifold has its exhaust outlet
between cylinders  3 and 4.

I already know from experience (the hard way) that the Jetta 1.6 TD
turbo, which is mounted on the exhaust manifold outlet between cylinders 2
and 3, will not fit the Vanagon because of interference with the left-side
motor mount.

My question is, what is the configuration of the factory Vanagon TD?  Did
they use the Quantum type manifold and turbo and the standard diesel motor
mount, or did they use a special motor mount for the turbo application?  

Thanks.
