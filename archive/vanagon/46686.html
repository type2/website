Subject: Re: My Volkswagens-an EPA Danger (a response)

&lt;&lt; What if I made my VW run CLEANER than it originaly did, like
 with an EFI setup?  If anything, you should have the option of having your
 car inspected for the original equipment OR doing a dyno test to prove your
 car is clean. &gt;&gt;

Pat Walsh makes an excellent question.  One that SEMA (Specialty Equipment
Manufacturers Association) has been lobbying for years but without success
because of the big-moneyed bureaucratic nonsensical people at the Federal and
State levels of gummint.

I for one, as a supplier of replacement emission parts would be happy without
having to pay thru the nose for such items originally installed on bugs and
buses over 10 years ago where most of them don't even work after being on
said vehicles after a year or two.  I'd rather be buying more of the other
stuff to supply people with good running vehicles (with stock or monter
motors) that aren't the pollution monsters the EPA, DOT and CARB purport them
to be.

If I remain in California, it's gonna come to the point that I will off-load
my Vanagons and just keep driving my 65 and earlier V-Dubs (or
whatever)........Well I am the original owner on my '67 Deluxe 21 Window and
I do have to have that tested every two years, but there's no real smog
equipment on it, so I'll keep that.   :-)

Just a simple sniff test should be enough :-)
