Subject: Re: vanagon questions to the folks that know

My wife and I both agree that, if we file for divorce, we will let the other
have the house, but claim the 87 Westy Syncro for ourself. Jim McCarthy

&gt;Regarding Consumer Reports, I don't believe that I've EVER read a
&gt;favorable review for ANY VW product. SNIP, SNIP
&gt;
&gt;What's there to say, while there are no guarantees and there are lemons
&gt;of EVERY type out there, you can't go too wrong with a vanagon.  I love
&gt;mine and wouldn't trade it for anything.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!

&gt;87 Vanagon GL Wolfs
