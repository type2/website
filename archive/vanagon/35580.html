Subject: Painting dilemma.....


Hello, again.

Okay, I have finally got this thing all cleaned up.  I am over questioning
myself for spending $250.  (welllll :-)

I have taken just about everything off of this '69 Westy that I can.  I am
down to the windows, the dash, the luggage rack section, and some sundry
items.  So, I am now at a crossroads for a decision:

Should I paint it myself or take it somewhere?

The particluare:

My garage is JUST big enough to house it and leave a bit of room to walk
around it.  There is some body work on the driver's side which was either
poorly done or not thought out.  I see the Bondo and the paint tells the
tale wherever the bondo is.  Also, some rust was uncovered under the floor
section.

There are also some holes (like where the PDO drilled one for his CB, etc)
that I would like filled.

I have never, ever, painted a car.  While I would more than willing to put
in the elbow grease to sand it what are my downfalls?  Should I primer it
RIGHT after sanding?  Can I ruin it by doing that?

If I take it to a shop how much am I looking at?  Any suggestions or
comments would be GLADLY appreciated!

Thanks again

-Marlin
