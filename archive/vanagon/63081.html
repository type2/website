Subject:      Dometic manual &amp; HOW TO LIGHT THE REFRIGERATOR

Don't pull the frig until you are absolutely sure it's broken!  I pulled
mine twice only to find out that I didn't know how to light it!  I found
that the problem was that fire requires both spark, fuel, and oxygen (air).
I finally learned that I could first blow air through the drain hole with
a small plastic pump. Then quickly click for the spark by pushing in the
air pump just as soon as I pressed and held in the light button.  What was
happening with me is that too much gas was getting in, the spark was
causing a mild pop (explosion) and then there was no oxygen left for the
next try. You have to add oxygen (air) after each attempt to light the frig
or all you have in the burner is gas. The propane seems to linger in the
chamber displacing the air. The combustion chamber is sealed from the
inside of the bus.  No air can enter the combustin chamber from the inside
of the bus.  The vent actually contains two pipes, one for the burned
exhaust gas and another for air to enter from the outside.  Air does not
enter from the bottom of the burner (it's sealed).  It must first go down
the outside inlet tube.  When I first start to light I hold the light
button in for several minutes to give the gas time to blow out all of the
air in the pilot light line.  Then I pump in air through the drain plug
(which, by the way, connects to the bottom of the sealed combustion
chamber)and begin the lighting procedure (see above).  What more can I say?
It works for me!

Hope this helps!

I may have the parts list and diagram you want.  Let me know if you don't
find one.  I could copy and send it to you.  Don't have a digitizer or I
would attach it.
