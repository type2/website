Subject: Re: Any experience with VWofCanada

I am sorry, but I don't think that there is a VW of Canada any more,
apart from a phone number that is. All operations were moved to the VWoA
offices.

&gt; Sorry for the lack of bus content, but I'm just brimming with VW content ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; In the next week we will be leasing a car for Caron.  One (or two) of the cars
&gt; we're considering are the Golf CL or one of the base-model-type Jettas.  Now I
&gt; know that VWoA has a really bad reputation and in user satisfaction surveys
&gt; they usually rate very close to the bottom of the pickle barrel.
&gt; 
&gt; So I would like to hear any good and bad experiences people have had with VW of
&gt; Canada (especially leases).  The fact that they gave Ron a Eurovan for the
&gt; Inuvik trip is definitely a notch on their steering wheel.  But if anyone has
&gt; had any troubles getting results out of VW for the warranty or if you have been
&gt; shocked by the amazing service, please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are on the vanagon list, please respond directly to me since I am only
&gt; subscribed to the TYPE2 list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx.
