We're approaching the same point but through mileage not age (bought it=20
as new in late '94), so we too are interested in this.

I'm getting real unhappy with the sound of the engine as it starts in =
the=20
morning.  The local dealer swears that it isn't that 'piston slapping=20
thing'.  They claim that it is only if the sound is always present=20
contradicting the information posted here earlier.  Is the piston slp=20
problem a drive train thing that would give me extra time or is it only=20
under the 24/24 bumper to bumper?  What do I do to convince the dealer=20
to reasses the engine?

Only things we've ad problems with so far are the various plastic pieces =

particularly on the MV jump seats.  The clips break off and the seatbelt =

parts scratch them.  We also had one of the cup holders break and the=20
replacement was slightly different - beefier looking so I hope it holds=20
up better.  Don't have power windows so we didn't have that problem.  We =

have (unfortunately) an automatic so does the shifter problem pertain=20
only to sticks?  There was a recall that did affect us but I can't=20
remember what it was.  Something minor like an engine fire problem &lt;g&gt;.

I really do feel this is an exceptionally well designed vehicle (despite =

the '90s levels of plastic). =20
