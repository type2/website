Subject: apology to Gerry and members

Dear Tobin and others who read my letter to sing off the newsletter,  I am
sorry that I typed the capitol letters and it came across as a scream. I
did'nt mean it as one, and I'm sorry I offended anyone. I am so new at all
this and I was trying to get help. I guess I find this a bit overwhelming at
times.  I sent Gerry a letter of persnal apoligy as he deserves and I wanted
you to know that I did'nt mean to be rude, really. You were right I was
frustrated, but thats no excuse. I also want to say that I was trying to help
my son (some help) in removing his name as he wanted (he couldn't keep up
with all the mail) from the list and I don't want him to be credited for the
way the letter was presented. I did it out of ignorance so please forgive me.
 I have learned a valuable Email lesson. Thank you for all the helpful
replys, I really appreciated them. I like all the warmth and genuineness I've
read and I think this is a very nice group of people. The thought of hurting
or offending any of you really bothered me so I wanted to make sure I made a
sincere effort to mend any bruised feelings.  This is a lesson learned.
Sincerely, Cathy
