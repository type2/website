&gt; How about SOLAR? Have you heard of REAL GOODS in Ukiah Ca. They have

&gt; battery. Best part of the whole deal is the fuel is free :-)

But solar cells aren't very cost effective right now.  If you want a 1 
amp (12 watts) cell, it'll cost about $80-100.  Suppose you needed an 
extra 15 amps.... I think the costs would be prohibitive.  Also alot of 
space would be needed, and sun shine. :)

OTOH, for that same $100 dollars, you could get the 70 amp alternator.  
Or for about $150, a 100 amp alternator.  If yo only had the stock 50 amp 
alt. then you would have gained 50 amps.  How much would it cost to get 
that kind of increase from solar cells?
