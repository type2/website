&gt;&gt; somebody tell me how many 100 watt bulbs I can plug into this cord?  

&gt;Hmmm.... let's see 1250 watt cord divided by 100 watts per bulb.... 
&gt;
&gt;Hmmmm...  I get 12 bulbs with 50 watts to spare.  What'd you get?

100ft is a long cord - so it is possible the cord could be coiled.
Therefore you may need to include the inductive resistance.  (I hear someone
saying &quot;iron core or air core&quot;.)

Really though, I'd worry more about running additional things since you may
get a voltage drop in the long cable (or in the hose wiring) so you would
want to be careful if you started running motors that can be damaged by low
voltage (and draw a lot of current during startup).

Besides, don't you need three phase for working on a VW?  Maybe that's year
dependent.
