Has anyone on the list ever heard of a flower vase that originally came
with VW buses (set on the dash)? What would originals be worth? My nephew
swears there was such a thing, but I've never heard of it.

Thanks!

   Ya, saw them (reproductions) in Wolfsberg West or one of the other &quot;nice&quot;
catalogs -- I can't imagine having enough spare money to do everything I'd like
to do with ye olde Transporter and then have $$ left over to put a little bud
vase on the dashboard...
