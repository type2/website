Subject: [F] Got a postcard from William Warburton!!
Date: Sun, 1 Jan 1995 17:34:19 -0800 (PST)

About a month ago I received a postcard from a former (and future!) list
member, William Warburton, whom I'm sure many of you remember.  I thought
the list might be interested in knowing that his tour of the Americas is
going well.  The postcard was mailed from Lima, Peru!

He says that every second car down there is a Beetle, and you can buy a
type II brand new (I guess like those Brazilian ones?  Hope he took pictures)
and that he is still planning on meeting up with the GNATT tour in May.
Good to know that William is still planning on attending, since he is
the only one who will likely make it from coast to coast.

Happy New Year everyone!

-David
