Subject: Re: A possible purchase


&gt;I spent eight months looking for a decent bus in Austin, and with all of 
&gt;the students and hippies, true bargains don't last.  The good part in 
&gt;your case with this bus is that it is neither dirt cheap nor can it be 
&gt;driven away; most students look for running vehicles and most older 
&gt;hippies look for cheap vehicles with good bodies and blown engines.  
&gt;Myself, I finally got a &quot;77 with very little rust and a dropped seat for 
&gt;$350   =8^)
&gt;
&gt;David!  DON'T &quot;SETTLE.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck, 
&gt;
&gt;Peter.

I got my '79 for $150 (it runs, not well, but it runs) and my '67 for $300
(it runs, too) so it definitely pays to shop around!  There always seems to
be a lot of busses for sale in the VA/DC area, maybe you should road-trip up
here and shop...

Bob.
