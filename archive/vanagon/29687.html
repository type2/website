There he sits.......


11/19/95 - Cloudy and 43

Removed the Fridge/Cooler/Sink/Stove unit.  Discovered a cool little propane
tank under the seat directly behind the drivers seat, disconnected it and
will use remaining propane to heat garage.

I then cut the vinyl floor (the part under the fridge...) out to find
delaminated plywood underneath, removed plywood to find delaminated steel
floor underneath, removed steel (only what flaked off) to find old gears and
brackets for some sort of adjustable step that was still hanging on by a
cable, cut off and trashed it.  The view of the driveway thru the floor
below reminded me of the Flintstones.......

The crossbeam that was used for the jack is rusted off back to the main
frame.

The drink-holder/storage cabinets on the rearward side door are off and in a
dry place along with the closet door.
  
Stuff Found Inside Bruno:

Under the rear bench - a black box about the size of a Welcome Mat and 4
inches high.  Glued to the top of the box is, you guessed it, a Welcome Mat.
 Inside the box is a length of hose along with an extension cord with the
proper adapter for the plug on the side of Bruno.  There is also what looks
like some sort of jumbo surgical tool - scissors like but curved with points
at the end of the curve, maybe a hubcap removal tool?

Under the front dash - a box, Hunter Pipes (Bob - sound familiar?) size,
containing one orange with yellow top Kodak film container (yes there is
some in there!), a Toaki lighter with built in pen, one pack of unopened
Euzella Taschentucher (handkerchiefs), a Durabeam Compact flashlight (that
works!), two packets of Pudenz fuses packaged like drugs, two books of
matches, and six 6 volt tiny little light bulbs.  The Pipe box is being
trashed (smells like mold) but the rest will stay.

In the Closet - Various Bar-b-que tools and a chess set, board rusted but
pieces ok.

11/24/95 - Cloudy and 35

Removed the bench directly behind the drivers seat - found a norelco reel to
reel tape player mounted to the wall behind driver seat.  Rodents nest on
top, trashed it.

11/25/95 - Cloudy and 43

Drove the 68 to the brother-in-laws farm for the winter, had to free up
garage space for the 65.  When the salt is washed away we will bring him
back to Cleveland.

11/26/95 - Cloudy and 50

Moved Bruno into the garage, his rear end supported by a floor jack.  The
rear wheels are still not turning.  Will have them turning by spring I hope.
 Removed the windows, window frames, interior panel, and drip guards (just
above the windows on the outside) from the side doors.  The putty around the
windows is still as tacky as the day it was installed, I used a torch to
soften it during removal.

The lower 8 inches of the doors are badly rusted.  I want to remove the
doors but the screws that hold the hinges on are very hard to get loose. 
Anyone have any ideas for freeing extra large phillips head screws?
