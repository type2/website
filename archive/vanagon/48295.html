Subject: EV modular camping storage report


I just came back from a brief camping expidition with my family (all 5 of 
us ... and my sister and brother-in-law). My plastic storage container 
system worked like a charm. I had two large containers (which fit into the 
rear under-the-luggage-shelf are) with food in one and dishes, pots, pans, 
etc in the other. Then I had three others which held screens, one did double 
duty of diswashing tub and container for diswashing stuff and the last held 
powercords, etc...

When I got home it only took 20 minutes (including time to vacuum the van) 
to unload all the gear, put back the rear mat (gets in the way of sliding 
the bed forward), and putting the jump seat back (where the cooler went)..


BTW, I wasn't the only EV at the campground...there were three Euro-Bagos 
there...one from CT, one from MA and one from Ontario.
