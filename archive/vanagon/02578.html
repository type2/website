&gt; 
&gt; push/pull valve to be impossible to close with soapy hands, so be
&gt; warned!  I was thinking of adding a pinch type thingie that squeezes
&gt; the tube shut to stop the water flow. I've got a nice one I use for
&gt; homebrewing beer, but don't know where else I'd find one of these.

Wow! You must be doing well to be able to take your showers in beer! ;)

&gt; book &quot;Manifold Destiny&quot; and learn how to prepare and cook foil-
&gt; wrapped meals by sitting them on your engine as you drive!  The
&gt; flat Vanagon engine looks to be an excellent design, but kinda hard
&gt; to get to if the area over it is loaded with your camping/travel
&gt; gear...

Would this be where the term &quot;Shake-N-Bake&quot; originated?  ;)

Sorry, couldn't resist..... ;P
