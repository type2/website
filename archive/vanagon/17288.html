&gt;&gt; Except for those with Syncros, which have an 18.5 gallon fuel capacity.
&gt;
&gt;Here's question for the other Syncro owners.  When my gas gauge reads
&gt;almost to the bottom of the reserve area, it only takes about 16 gals
&gt;to fill the tank.
&gt;
&gt;It seems like the gas gauge is calibrated for a 16 gallon tank rather
&gt;rather than the bigger 18.5. Any other syncro owners notice this?

I've had mine down so that there was only about a gallon left in the tank.
The gauge was pegged below the reserve area. When I touch the bottom of my
reserve area, it ususally takes about 16.5 gallons to fill the tank.
