Hi Dan and fellow Westfalia Owners
As you know our son's trip to Vancouver Island with our '74 Westie was
accomplished successfully. Unfortunately things didn't work out with his
girlfriend and he ended up flying home at Christmas and staying home.
To shorten a long story he is going out on Saturday and bringing the
Westie home to Grimsby.Ontario He and a friend are taking the direct
route through the USA  via I 90, I 94 and I69.
We haven't been listening to &quot;vanagon&quot; lately, but,
Anyone en route who can offer encouragement, etc would be appreciated.
Please email me direct at trevor_easton_at_dofasco_dot_ca before Thursday or
ag278_at_freenet.hamilton.on_dot_ca before Saturday
Thanks in anticipation.
