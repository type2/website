Hi Volks,
  Just wanted to drop a note to say I haven't dropped of the face of the
Earth.  I'm mades to updates to LiMBO's web site.  Check it out.  I've
added links to everyone that e-mailed me back a couple of months ago.  If
you would like to be linked please E-mail me direct.  I'll be more than
happy to, all I ask is the same in return.   Also, if anyone has an event
that they know of in their area and  they would like published on our
events page,please E-mail me all the details.
       If possible please send it in the following format:

    (VT)  Sat-Sun June 8th and 9th.  The Ben and Jerrys VW show and
Campout, in Waterbury, VT.  The camping will be at Limehurst Lake
Campground in Williamstown, VT. All VW's welcome for a fun and informal
gathering and swap.  Info: Steve Paine (508) 362-9877 or Jim D (413)
743-1814. E-mail: limbo_at_bcn_dot_net.

   By the way, that is the Info for the upcoming show at Ben and Jerrys.
Perhaps we can make this a listserv members gathering as well. We can make
it an East coast camping event for the History books. I here that Martha
and the gang can cook up a good party out on the West coast. Maybe Ric
Golen will bring the home brew. (I missed out at Rites of Spring)
  The LiMBO web address is below.  Thanks in advance, take care.  See you
at Ben and Jerry's
