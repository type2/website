	I was just here last weekend with my family, and it was great.
Well over a hundred camp sites and less than a third of them were filled.
We camped in the sites down near the beach it was short walk to the water
and beautiful view of Port Townsend. The sites were $11 per night + $5 for
each additional vehicle.
	We saw numerous birds including, bald eagles, harliquins and
loons.  We also saw seals and deer.

&gt; May 4 weekend
&gt; Moran State Park, Orcas Island, WA ( a much longer trip - no bridge)

May 4 weekend won't work for me.  Orcas is a great place to vist, sorry I
won't be able to make this one.
