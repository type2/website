Subject: instrument cluster bulb

Does anyone know how to remove the instrument cluster bulbs that light the
speedometer, tach and clock? One of them burned out and I cannot for the life
of me figure out how to get that little black bulb holder off?! I check
Bentley which said &quot;Remove bulb holder&quot;... Hmmm...
