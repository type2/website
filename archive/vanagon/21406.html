Subject: Bought an '88 (real cheap)

As I mentioned previously, the tow truck guy who brought my new 1985 Wolfsburg
on Saturday mentioned he had picked up a 1988 Vanagon with only 46K miles.
He said someone else was interested in it , so I wasted no time in making an
appointment to look at it myself.
Well, I saw it at 7:00 this morning, and sure enough it was a 1988 automatic
with only 46,110 miles. The previous owner ran something over with it and
mangled
the gas tank. Apparantley they thought the frame was all srewed up(it wasn't).
The van wansn't in the best shape cosmetically(broken windshield, seats thrown
about the vehicle) , but it is complete. 
Later this week I will try to hook something up and get it running(I hope).
So far, at $300 it is the deal of the day!
Due to the condition of the body etc. this will turn out to be a parts car.
If the motor runs I will put it in my new camper(head leak).
