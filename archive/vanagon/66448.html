&gt;Harald brings up a good point.  My '91 seems to be sagging on the left
&gt;(drivers side).  It is extremely low mileage at under 75,000 kms (47,000
&gt;miles).  This past summer we took several camping trips with the van full,
&gt;especially the water tank.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else experienced the drivrs side sag on their Westy?  Any
&gt;possible long term solutions?

I have an '88 Westy that has a noticable list to the left - more so when
the water tank is filled. 104K miles. I have not measured it, but my guess
is that there is 1.2&quot; difference in height (water tank empty,.)
