Subject: horn wiring

'80 FI aircooled vanagon CA
Hi all. I was trying to fix a problem with the horn on my van and found the
wire connector near the floor on the steering wheel shaft corroded,
replaced it and still no fix. Next I checked the connections in the
steering wheel and found that the connection inside the s/wheel was not
making good contact. So the problem is I can't get to the contacts within
the steering wheel. Does anybody have any suggestions



Thanks, Rudy B. Santa Rosa, CA
