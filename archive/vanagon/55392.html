Subject: EV VR6 non-camper sighting

 &gt;&gt; It was outlandishly painted with a wild blue K2 paint scheme, and
 was clearly some kind of VW-sponsered courtesy vehicle operating
 around one of the resorts.  It also said, &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; on it. &lt;&lt;

 Yeah, I saw one of those here in Seattle a month or so ago.  The paint job
looked more like a giant decal.  Nice shade of red though, and the &quot;Kombi&quot;
interior was cool...
