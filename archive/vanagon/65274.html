Hi: I had a friend that had a car that did the same thing to him. He had
a couple of kids that would use the last drop of gas in the car (like
kids do) when they used it. The guage read normal until one day
something went wrong and it would be empty and show a quarter tank.
Well, the kids used the car a couple of times and ran out of gas. My
friend then fixed the guage and didn't tell the kids. They always left a
quarter tank of gas in the car after that!
