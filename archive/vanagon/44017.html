Subject: Help: Vanagon Cruise Control

Hi,
I am trying to install a cruise control (from Sun Distributing) on my '89
Westy and I cannot find a way to connect the actuator cable to the throttle.
It seems like it would be easy, however, there is no place w/in 18&quot; of the
throttle to fix the cable sheath.  

I looked at picture of the VW cruise control acutuator in the Bently manual
using a rod instead of a cable looks like the way to go.  Does anyone that
has done this have any suggestions?  I think that I could use the VW
actuator, however I don't have the part number.  Also, it's probably expensive!

TIAFYH,
Bo Kersey
