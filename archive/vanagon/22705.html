I don't know where the speedo pickup is on those new buses you people 
drive is.  But if it's in the front axel then the speedo would stay the 
same even if you got larger tires, just so long as the front is the same 
size as the rear.  Oh, personally, I like the look of the Yokohamas that 
Costco has.
