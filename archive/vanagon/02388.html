Subject: shower in a westy!


OK, everyone out there - I need your input.  I sort of borrowed 
this idea from something Joel mailed me he'd seen in a VW book,
then made some of my own theoretical modifications.  I'd like to
hear from interested parties what you see as potential pitfalls
in the design.

My plan is to take a rubbermaid 10 gallon tub and put it up
in the luggage rack of the westy.  This would then be covered
with some sort of clear plastic bubble, rather like a skylight.  The
tub will be black, or painted black, then filled with water.  This
is all obviously done while parked, and the car won't be driven
while the tub is full.  Anyway, like a solar shower, it sits
out in the sun, and is supposed to reach temperatures warm
enough for a shower within 3 hours or so.  (Or, one could always
boil water and add it thru the screened window if the water
needed to be hotter).  Then lay a hose in the tub (thermometer
in there if you like) and run it the length of the westy,
plus another 3-5 feet, ending in a shower head, with an 
on/off button at the handle, sort of a phone shower I guess.
The water flow could be started either by siphon, or cordless
pump (JC Whitney).  A shower curtain attaches around the
edges of the rear hatch door, which is lifted.  A second curtain can
also go right where the hatch would be if it were down,
to protect the interior of the van from getting wet.  Depending
on location of &quot;shower,&quot; grey water can be collected in another
rubbermaid tub, (which, when not in use, will nestle under
the one above in the luggage rack), and emptied at the 
appropriate location.  

The luggage rack in my '81 is rated to hold not in excess of
110 pounds, and 10 gallons of water weighs about 80 pounds.  This
leaves extra allotment for the skylight bubble, and the weight
of the tub, and altogether would probably still not exceed
the 110 lbs.  One would have to stand on some sort of rack
or mat to avoid getting muddy feet, but otherwise, I don't see 
why this wouldn't work, except that I'm not sure how much
of a shower 10 gallons is.  Anyone have an idea?

Anyway, would like further input on this...thanks!
