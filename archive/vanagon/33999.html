So Sarah says:
&gt; 
&gt; Taking the rear brakes apart was no problem, but the springs are bigger &amp;
&gt; different in the front. Muir says glibly &quot;just pry the bottom of the shoe
out of
&gt; the slot and twist to remove the springs&quot; (or something). Impossible. Will
&gt; draining the brake system help? I tried taking the cylinders off, undid the
only
&gt; bolts I could see (getting desperate!) but that just made the backplate
loose.
&gt; Anymore of those good ideas on how to do this bit? 
&gt; 


Hi Sarah,

Yes, brake springs are a bi---, uh, pain in the butt for me too.  A 
word of caution: I hope you are wearing protective goggles when you 
are doing this step.  Those tight springs can get shot in any direction 
given half a chance and do alot of bodily harm.  Okay, that said, the 
way I do it is with a pair of old needle nose pliers and alot of grunting 
and groaning and 4-letter adjectives to help it along.  Sometimes when 
the laws of physics side with the spring and no matter how much of the 
above said procedure is applied, I take a medium sized screwdriver and 
lever the edge of the pliers that are hooked around the spring against 
the edge of the screwdriver with it's tip pushed against a solid part 
of the faceplate surface.  This tips the scales in my favor and I'm 
able to get the spring out with some more coaxing and twisting.  So 
grab a screwdriver or something similar that you can leverage against 
in the same way.  This way, you hands and wrists don't go to hell 
before the job is done.

===========================
Drum brakes are, by design, a major pain in the butt, I hate 'em with a
passion - I strongly recommend that if any of you are going to put up with
them, you invest in a few simple tools:
1) A screwdrive like thing that instead of ending in a blade, kinda has a
round shaft with a wide groove milled in it - it gets under the spring hooks
and lets you lever them on/off
2)  another screwdrive handled thing that has a round cup at the business end.
 It seats against the little round retainer that goes over the spring and
&quot;nail&quot; that holds the brake shoe against the backing plate and facilitates
removal/installation of the &quot;nail&quot;/spring/retaining disk assembly.

And yes - I thourghly agree with Steve about Safety goggles!!!!
