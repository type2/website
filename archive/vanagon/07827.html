Subject: Coolant gauge/light secrets revealed!

&gt;&gt; The bus is fine with the new coolant, I do not think it overheated, I 
&gt;&gt; think I was tripping the low coolant switch on the overflow tank.  The 
&gt;&gt; light was flashing, not steady (responding to Mr. Stones) but I don't 
&gt;&gt; think that LED is wired to ever be steady.  The temperature gauge needle 
&gt;&gt; was sometimes registering the engine as cool when the light would flash.
&gt;
&gt; I beleive it is flash for low level in the tank and steady for real hot.
&gt; I don't know, I've never gotten steady either but I may have read it
&gt; somewhere... I don't know why else I would think that.  (Hallucination?)

The above post appeared last week and concerns how the coolant gauge 
and warning light operate.  From what I can tell looking at Bentley and 
my own 85 Vanagon the interpretation of the gauge is NOT straightforward.

If the gauge is pegged to the top or &quot;HOT&quot; end of the scale,
it does NOT always mean the coolant is too hot.  In fact, the coolant
can even be be cold.

It appears that the gauge and light are a single instrument and do not
really register independent readings.  I surmise that the light is set 
to start flashing whenever the input to the gauge exceeds a certain 
voltage.  I do not think the light ever comes on steady.

The gauge/light is driven by a connection to both the temperature gauge
and a control module.  The control module is driven by the low coolant 
sensor on top of the plastic bottle in the engine compartment.  

The gauge/light normally reads the output of the temp sensor and 
indicates the engine temperature.  If the output of the temp sensor
exceeds a preset voltage (about the time the gauge is reading at 
the top of its scale), then the light will begin to flash.

The coolant level sensor is simply two probes that stick down into the
coolant.  The control module reads the resistance of the coolant 
between the probes to determine that the level is ok.  If the coolant
drops too low, the probes are no longer immersed and the circuit
becomes &quot;open&quot;.  The control module then signals a problem by switching 
sufficient voltage to the gauge/light so that the gauge will read &quot;HOT&quot; 
and the light will flash.

Naahhh.. you're saying!

Try it.  When you engine is cold, turn on the ignition.  After the 
coolant gauge/light finishes it's startup test (blinking), remove the 
connector from the coolant level detector on top of the coolant bottle
in the engine compartment.  Anything happen with the gauge/light?
Nope.  Now wait a minute and check again.  You will see that the light
is flashing and the gauge is SLOWLY moving towards the max or hot end
of it's scale.  Wait another minute or so and the gauge will peg at 
the top of the scale.

Hmmm... they must have been laughing all night in Wolfsburg when they
thought up this one!  

There is apparently a delay built into the control module to prevent 
low coolant readings when coolant sloshes in the tank.  Also, the temp 
gauge is heavily damped and moves very slowly in response to input 
voltage changes.

The startup test is possibly accomplished by having the control module
send a full voltage output for about 3 seconds when first powered up.
That causes the light to flash.  But the gauge is so slow that it 
doesn't begin to move in the short time for the test. 

I first discovered this when my heads began to leak.  I thought I was 
overheating.  In reality, the coolant was just low.  When I stopped to 
check things out, enough coolant flowed back into the bottle so I didn't
immediately notice it was low.  Drove me crazy.

Not only is this obscure, but the owner's manual doesn't point it out.  
It correctly describes the function of the temperature gauge with 
respect to temperature readings.  And it states that the light will 
FLASH for either overtemp or low coolant.  But it neglects to mention 
what the gauge does for low coolant.  Kinda dumb to let people think 
the gauge is always showing temperature when sometimes it's not!

Now, if I can only figure out why the headlights go off and the radio 
stays on when I shut off the ignition ...  :-)
