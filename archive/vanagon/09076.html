Some additional information about FUNKENGROOVIN(tm)

&quot;An International Network Of Volkswagen Enthusiasts&quot;

&quot;You can see it in their eyes as you pass on the highway. There is just
something about Volkswagen owners. THEY KNOW! They know the joys of travel
on the open road. They know a certain sense of satisfaction when the
engine is tuned just right. They know that which only another Volkswagen
owner can know... that German word...!? It's the magical feeling that ties
us all together.&quot;

We're setting out to explore that magic and connect with Volkswagen
enthusiasts of ALL KINDS. We've created FUNKENGROOVIN: An International
Network Of Volkswagen Enthusiasts.

FUNKENGROOVIN is not affiliated with any club or organization. We have no
agenda, other than to connect with Volkswagen enthusiasts of ALL KINDS --
past and present owners of air or water cooled vehicles, restorationists,
hobbyists, collectors, artists, travelers, and dreamers. Our goal is to
provide a &quot;vehicle&quot; through which people from all walks of life can share
the common and not so common experience of Volkswagen ownership.

Schedule of Events, contests and prizes, and much more.
