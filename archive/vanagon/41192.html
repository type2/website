Hey all,
Further development on the intermittant wipers question.  I have a
wiper switch that I got from Steve's now cubed '79 last weekend.  This
switch has the fourth position (when you pull back) that the one on my
'78 does not have.  

Here's what the '79 switch has:
There are four wires that lead to contacts in the switch which
correspond to the various positions of the wiper switch.  However, as we
know it now (non-intermittant), there are only three positions:  the
first position where bump it up a little and the wipers sweep once, the
low position, and the high position.  That accounts for three of the
contacts -- check me here, I'm not sure I know quite how the
wiper switch works.

If the above is true, then there is a fourth contact in the switch which
is unaccounted for, which I assume is contacted when the switch is
pulled back.  

So, my query:
Could I just drop in the intermittant wipers relay and have instant
intermittant wipers or is there some wiring to the switch I would have
to do.  I noticed on the switch that there is a blank spot where another
contact is supposed to connect.  Would I have to run a wire from this
contact to the new intermittant relay??

Anyone have intermittant wipers that knows?

I'm kinda interested in this, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Sean
