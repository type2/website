Subject:  Needed Parts..

I am looking for some old hubcaps for my 76 type II bus.  I also may need
to find some used heater boxes.  If anyone in the DC area has these
parts, please let me know!  I don't know how important these heat
exchangers are to the vital functions of my bus, but I was told I may not
pass Maryland inspection with the amount of rust damage they have
incurred.  Lastly, as I am about to replace my tires, is it really key to get
the reinforced sidewall tires, or will some regular 185/75-14 tires do the
job?  Thanks!
