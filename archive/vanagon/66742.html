Subject:      sealing  compound, need help

--------------
        I am doing a major rebuild on my 2.1 and have sealant questions.
First is there a better book than the Bentley for the 2.1? I find it
somewhat lacking, this is probably due to my inexperience with 2.1L. I need
something like the Tom Wilson book for the air cooled .

What type on sealant should be used on the case split? Is the aviation
stuff we use  on 2.0L OK?
My gasket kit contained  some curil k2 Bentley never calls for this stuff
where is it used?

What is used on the rubber head gasket?

The  head nuts?

Are the cylinder o-rings installed dry?
When bentley calls for akd 456 000 01,amv 188 001 02    or   &quot;d3  brownish
color Sealant&quot; and d 000 400  are these VW part numbers?

Also what kind of greese is  &quot;MOS base 2&quot; for the pilot bearing?Will
chevron sri factory lub sub OK?

Thanks much for any help on the above items as I am somewhat confused  .
