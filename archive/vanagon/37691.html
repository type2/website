You're too stealthy for me.  Oh well, I guess I have to cut off all my hair.
 Wait!--- &quot;Not Fade Away  4-2-95&quot;  Am I warm?

Since I have the Alabama 'antique vehicle' tag, I cannot do the 
personalization  thing.  Of course, the tag was only $10 and it's good 
forever.  No emmissions laws in Alabama either! (cough-cough)

Your friendly cycling-to-work vegetarian,

p.s.)  I tried to check my vacuum advance by the suck-on-the-greasy-hose 
       method, but it barely moved at all.  How much movement should I be 
       looking for?
