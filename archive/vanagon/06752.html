I have heard some theories about splitting up Iowa into north/south,
but they usually leave the realm of good taste.  About 15 miles south
 
On yet another varied note, becuase of somewhat good fortune,
I should be getting my engine at jobber cost, and also have 
jobber catalogs for West Coast Metric, and Mill Supply.  If
anyone needs anything out of these, maybe they can be had
for cheap?
