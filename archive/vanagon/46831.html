Subject: Fridge removal and repair

     This note is in response to Arie's request for removal instructions for his 
     refrigerator.
     
     The instructions that were posted some time ago and the instructions in the 
     Bentley manual were very helpful in getting the fridge out of the 
     compartment and instead of rewriting them, I'm sure someone will repost 
     them.
     
     I just wanted to elaborate on what I did &quot;after&quot; I got the fridge out.
     
     Mine, too, wasn't starting so I did a couple of things.
     
     First, the Piezo starter assembly was loose so that when I depressed the 
     button nothing happened.  Tightened that up, and while looking through the 
     sight glass in the lower left cornet inside of the fridge...Have to be 
     looking at just the right angle to see anything...pressed the piezo button 
     a few times to verify that there was a spark...there was. This is best done 
     in the evening or in a dark spot to see anything.
     
     Next I pulled the burner box apart and emptied all of the scale that was in 
     it and generally cleaned up in there...not much else to do.
     
     Then back up on top of the fridge, I began the rework process described in 
     the Bentley, I bought the check valve, bored out the holes as described, 
     and fitted it all back together.  Cleaned the fins on the back, verified 
     that the thermo switch and fan worked and then put the fridge back in and 
     hooked it up for a test run.
     
     First turned the main valve on and lit a stove burner to purge most of the 
     air out of the main line.  Then proceeded to start the fridge by following 
     the steps on the door.  I think the only thing I do differently, and I 
     don't really know if it helps, is to push in the piezo a few times instead 
     of just once.  Since working on the fridge, it starts right up everytime.
     
     The diode glows when the burner is lit and looking through the sight 
     glass(again dark helps) at just the right angle, you should see a small 
     thin blue line of the flame.  You should also be able to tell if it is 
     burning by listening carefully in the vent for a slight noise of the flame.
     
     Send me a note if you have any specific questions.
