Subject: Re: Rear Hitch

I pursued this a while back and have since abandoned it since the
hitch on our other car works fine.  The hitch that attaches to the
tow hooks is made by Rigid Hitch in Bloomington MN.  Don't have a
phone number.  Some people reported getting them from their FLAPS.

&gt; Hi Gang:    Anyone out there know the mfg., address and price of the rear 
&gt; hitch that mounts on the 'tow eyes'? I have a '86 Westy. I want to tow my 
&gt; '72 Bug, can do?
