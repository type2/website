Subject: '82 Westy?

Well, I may have stumbled onto a find.... 

My wife and I currently own and enjoy a '74 Westfalia camper; it's in pretty 
decent shape for its age, but it's definitely getting a little long in
the tooth. 
While camping this weekend in Cook Forest State Park (about 2 hrs NE of 
Pittsburgh), we met some folks who said they have a &quot;lightly wrecked&quot; 
'82 Westy they want to sell for repair or parts.  It supposedly has only about 
40,000 miles on it, only about 1,000 on a rebuilt engine.  Needs a new front 
clip and a door or two.  All of the camping equipment has &quot;hardly been used&quot;. 

So, what might a fair price for this beast be?  I feel pretty competent
to judge 
the repairability of the vehicle, as well as determining what work I'll
have to 
farm out.  Are there any particular weak spots to look for?  Is the frame 
likely to be bent beyond all hope of straightening? 

Thanks in advance!
