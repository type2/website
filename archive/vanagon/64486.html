Subject:      I love junkyards

     I spent about an hour on a 84 in a yard yesterday with a scary front
impact (steering collumn vertical, drivers floor crumpled)
     Two hubcaps, power steering resivoir and hoses, coolant resivoir,
engine compartment tin and a airflow meter.  (everything I was looking
for)
     The guy apologized for charging me $75

     I didn't get the near perfect rear bumper, as I wasn't sure if $100
was a good deal or not.
