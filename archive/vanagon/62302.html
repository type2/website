Sorry I didn't get back to you right away.. On vacation and I had about
550 messages to get through first.
So far, the thing that has made mine livable is the wiper arm
adjustment. 
I'm not completely satisified with the logic but it has helped
significantly.  On the above mentioned trip we went over 1300 miles and
2/3 of those were around 80 mph.  Mileage back up in the mid teens.
Still planning to refine the adjustment using a CO meter. 

The adjustment involved the AIR FLOW SENSOR. sometimes called the Air
box  Looking into the engine compartment you will see it between the air
filter box and the throttle body. It has a large electrical connector in
the back and a black plastic cover about 3&quot; square on the top.  To
start, you need to remove the cover. I ran a knife around the edge to
break the glue seal and mine came off with a little patience. Once you
can see into the box, you will see the wiper assy. There are basically 2
things that you can adjust, the spring pressure and the relationship
between the electrical wiper and the mechanical air vane.  I wouldn't
suggest messing with the spring pressure. First, note the exact position
where the screw is originally in case you want to return it. Then I
loosened the set screw holding the wiper arm until it was just slightly
holding then I started the van and let it warm up.  Without changing the
adjustment yet try and move the whole wiper assy one way or the other a
little to see if the engine runs better. You will be simulating the
sensing of more or less air depending which way you move it. You will
feel the air flow as you try to move it.  Try it at different RPM's and
see if the same &quot;correction&quot; improves it across the range.  If you can
get an identifiable gain, hold the mechanical side and move the
electrical side to the area that seemed to do best. tighten the screw
and try the different RPM thing again. 
I found that the adjustment on mine was very small, less than 1/16&quot;.
Also, be sure not to dirty the area that the wiper touches. It is
similar to the volume control on a radio and is sensitive to
contamination.  Cleaning the area with a lint free cloth and alcohol
might help.  When satisfied, reseal the cover with RTV or Fingernail
polish.  Remember this is not the final word on repairs, its just what
worked for me until I have a better answer.

I also included another site that might help:

Hope this gets you going. If I wasn't clear on anything, tell me and
I'll try again.

Good luck

Mark
