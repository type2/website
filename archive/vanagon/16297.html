]Er, not to take away from prospective list members from good old
]Tschairmanie, but don't we already have a couple of German ex-pats on
]the list?

What's the big deal about getting (or not getting) Germans on this list?
The Atari groups I frequent have nearly as many Germans on them as
Americans, and that's an American product, fer cryin' out loud.  I'd
think a list devoted to a German product would find Germans dominating.
Where are they all hiding?

Viele Gruesse aus Austin,
