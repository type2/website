Re: grab it at $1500 -- that number looked pretty good to me, too; seems
like somebody could hot up a Rabbit Pickup with it.  But if you Syncro
people are going to be so nitpicky (no rework of the back deck, no re-
duced ground clearance, no elimination of the engine skid plate, heck
you prob'ly still want the exhaust to come out the back instead of the
front) you're going to be driving horizontally opposed flat fours your
whole life.
