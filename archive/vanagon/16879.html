Subject: Newbie question

Can someone send me the VAGON digest FAQ.  I couldn't access it
via the WWW.  I'm mainly interested in a list of parts vendors 
with catalogs that interest me, a 84 Vanagon owner.  I have something
like four catalogs for parts for my Datsun '72 240Z and find them
invaluable.  Does such a thing exist for the Vanagon land?

Thanks in advance for helping a newbie...
