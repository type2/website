&gt; bullets its proof against. 22 Short? Sure, NATO .308? maybe
&gt; Russian 7.62 X 39mm? maybe. .415 Weatherby? Probably not.
&gt; 30mm depleted uranium GAU-8? No way. 
&gt; 120mm smoothbore penetrator?? Come on!

During the gulf war we shot an Iraqi Vanagon with a TOW 
anti-tank missile--it wasn't bulletproof....
