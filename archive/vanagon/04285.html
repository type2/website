Subject:      asking for help once more...(bread loafers)

I have a line on a 1978 bus with a 1974 SUPER BEETLE engine (???!!!). Does
this raise any hackles? Alsothe bus is possibly in need of some carb work. He
said that the bus floods and stalls at stops and that he had it fixed before
but it's starting to happen again. Anyone hear of this before?
