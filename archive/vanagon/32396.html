Subject: forced induction

You just defined how a turbocharger works.  You have to be careful --
any positive pressure above a ratio of 1.3 will possibly ruin the
heads.  In terms of being able to get this kind of boost with a mere
fan, I'd say it is unlikely.  Turbochargers use turbines inserted in
the exhaust pipeline to get enough power for the compressor of the
booster.  Another thing to watch out:  there may be flaps/valves
inside the carbs that will not react predictably to positive presuure:
the choke flaps are a good example (they will operate when they are
being sucked on, but will they operate when soemthing is putting
pressure on them from the other side?)

If you actually get to do this, assuming you cover up all pressure
leaks, etc..., you'll find out that the electric motor will draw a lot
more than 6 amps as you get better and better pressure buildup inside
the air cleaner assembly.  You see, the motor requires 6 amps at the
amount of work it is currently doing.  If there's a real pressure
differential at both sides of the fan (1.0/1.3 atmospheres), then it
will have to work harder to keep  'pumping' the  air  to the high-pressure
side.

My guess is the improvement will be minimal at best.

In any case, I'm always interested in experiments like this, so keep
us posted.

 &gt; 	So I'm thinking to myself, I've got this huge blower fan on the
 &gt; ceiling of my engine compartment that is controlled by a switch on the
 &gt; dash.  Its purpose is to blow air down into the heat exchangers to boost
 &gt; the heater output.  I'm thinking I could unhook the hose at the heat
 &gt; exchanger and clamp it around the intake on the air cleaner.  One flip
 &gt; of the switch and I would have positive manifold pressure, through the
 &gt; air cleaner.  Probably not a lot, but perhaps 1 psi?  Half of a psi?
 &gt; Maybe it would be enough to make up for the additional work that the
 &gt; motor has to do to draw the air through the air cleaner.  I'm going to
 &gt; try it real soon now.  I plan on hooking a vacuum gauge to the manifold
 &gt; to verify results.  Anyone care to predict what will happen?
 &gt; 
 &gt; 	BTW, I realize running the motor will draw 6 amps or more that will have
 &gt; to be made up by the alternator.
