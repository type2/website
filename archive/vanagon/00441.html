Subject: Re:  Sweeter &quot;tunes&quot; for the Vanagon

eager_r_at_apollo.hp_dot_com (Richard Eager) sez:
&gt; 
&gt; Now my Vanagon is running better I'm interested in making some other
&gt; improvements.  Unlike the other two I've owned, the '87 I have now came with
&gt; a pretty nice looking &quot;VW Design&quot; radio/tape player combination.  Is it any
&gt; good?  The stock speakers in Vanagons are so lousy it hard to tell !

We replaced the front speakers with better ones of about the same
size.  I think they were JBLs.  It made a big difference.  The stock
radio is not a super-high-power unit, but at reasonable listening
levels, it sounds pretty good.  And it has a better FM tuner (in terms
of urban listening -- intermod from other stations etc) than most
I've had, including the otherwise-wonderful JVC radio in our other
car.

&gt; Anyway, I'm not interested in an amplifier and all that, just better quality 
&gt; speakers. Could new speakers possibly be as large as 6x9, fit the depth of 
&gt; the door and still remain flush with the front so the window crank handle 
&gt; passes by smoothly (no jammed fingers for me)?

I dunno if there's that much room behind the panel.  There are some pretty
nice 5-6&quot; speakers out there that will fit.
