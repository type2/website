Subject: Re: Mercedes Pop-Ups

As I have been locating the resources that would allow for more accessory
choices for Vanagons/Eurovans, I have actually spoken to a gentleman in
Dusseldorf Germany who works for REIMO.  It sounds as if Mercedes pop-up
interiors are done through REIMO as wll as other things.

Fax 49-6103-42064.  We had a discussion around the way VW dealers used to
put together those Germany package deals whereby one could pick and choose
the interiors and have a company in Germany do the interior conversion and
you would fly over and some one would pick yopu up.  You would then go on
at least a twoo hundred mile vacation within Germany so that you would be
exporting a used vehicle.  The price seemed to be woth it.  VW of America(I
guess) doesn't do this now that Winnebeo-BOOOO- does the interiors.  SO
even if the cocl pop-up Transporters and their even cooler choices for
interiors don't come to USA, maybe someone out there might set up a
tourpackage similar to the one that used to be offered alon time ago.
Westfalia seems to be only one of several companies in Germany that do the
interior conversion.  ( But then again, I am only beginning to scratch the
surface on these topics.)
