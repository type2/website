What's a Zamboni? 

There was a reference to one in an ER episode shown here last week. 
The story related to a drunk Zamboni driver injuring some kids. Because I 
didn't know what it was I didn't get the connection.

In relation to aerodynamics, I heard a story recently about a bloke from 
Sydney taking his turbocharged bay window bus to Australia's Northern 
Territory (home of Ayer's Rock, Kakadu National Park, etc), where there 
are no speed limits, to try and see how fast his bus would go. I can't 
remember if he got it up to 198kmh or 198mph. Whatever it was, it 
would be bloody fast in a bus. Of course, the speedo needle was stuck 
against the stop and he calculated his speed from the tacho. He was 
annoyed (extremely pissed off actually) that he couldn't get over 200 
(kmh or mph).
