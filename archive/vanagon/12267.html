&gt;bookstore in town that carries Volksworld magazine from the UK.  I have
&gt;ordered the VW Bus Custom Handbook by Lawrence Meredith as well.  Any
&gt;negative comments?  I can cancel my order up until Friday...  Please
&gt;advise fellow 'Brick' drivers.

i have only positive comments ... well, except for the fact that all the
steering wheels are on the 'wrong' side. ;)  i like the book, and while it
does not have as much vanagon stuff as i personally would like, i do like
to see all the old splits and breadloafs (&quot;Bay Windows&quot; to the brits). can't
see how they figure a vanagon is a &quot;wedge&quot;, though.
anyway, i think it's a neat book and well worth the money. not much help in
fixing things, but neat for the coffee table or relaxing. some interesting
ideas on some of the buses. :)
