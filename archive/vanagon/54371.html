&gt; &gt;Hey Tim Smith - you've got a BBW 46 (you lucky dog!!)  Where is the
&gt; 
&gt; Yup, too bad the DPO gutted all the plumbing, and the mech who did it for
&gt; him put all the parts in the trash after keeping them for a year, (howls of
&gt; anguish here, pls)  It's made by Webasto, and any wasserboxer wanting a
&gt; camping furnace ought to seriously look at one of these units.
&gt; The digital control is by my left knee, just under the air vent.  About
&gt; 3&quot;x2&quot;high, smaller LCD screen with 4 buttons in a row under, and a couple of
&gt; LEDS either side of screen. The mounting housing fits dash perfectly and is
&gt; very much OEM style.  Controller slide/clips in.
&gt; 
&gt;   Can't figure what the '88 widget is either, remote head for a radar
&gt; detector the owner didn't hide very well?  I have a Cobra 'Trapshooter Pro'
&gt; that fits that description, but the head is well hidden in a low parcel
&gt; shelf, under a lid with the audio response turned up loud.  The provincial
&gt; Gestapo frown on such things. ($500 frowns)  bye all, tim

Does this things really work? I mean the radar detector? Is it combined 
radar/laser? I would really want to lay my hands on one, but they are 
kind of a little illegal in sweden. Maybe because they do work good!
