My solutions, in order of trying:

	1. a folder teatowel
	2. a folder handtowel
	3. adjusting the latches
	4. sticking on fresh foam rubber &quot;stops&quot;
	5. a folded teatowel again

I do a lot of logging road travel, and the rattling really is irksome. The
folded towels and new rubber stops work fine; the towel silences the
stainless drip tray, and the stops to silence the lid proper.

Lining the &quot;overhead&quot; gutter-like tray with thin foam, carpeting or that
marine rubber gauze anti-slip stuff also helps in the anti-rattling battle.
