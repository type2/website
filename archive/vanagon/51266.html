Subject: Re: 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels on the Syncro?

&gt; I know this subject has been kicked around before, but I've never seen
&gt; these specific questions answered:
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone on the list upgraded their Syncro to 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels?
&gt; 
Mine came with 15&quot; allows, and I'm running 215/70-15R LT Uniroyal Larado's
on it and it does fine.  The speedometer is accurate, too, so I suspect that
mine might have lower gearing that most.  Three different R&amp;P ratios were
available, apparently.  I don't know what I have.

&gt; If so, what wheels were used and what are their specs (ie. width, offset)?
&gt;
The wheels are 6&quot; wide, same offset as stock 14&quot; steelies.  There's a VW
part number on them.  I understand that the part may be from an Audi.  Both
the VW and Audi logos appear.  Tim Smith found a set of these with the same
part number in steel rather than aluminum at a Canadian dealer.  The center
hole in the wheels fits only the syncro's -- the regular Vanagon's front hub
is too large.  Mine were trimmed, easy to do on alloys.  It looks like 235's
would also fit.  I had no problems with wheelwell clearance, the only possible
place that might be a problem is the trailing arm on the rear wheel.  There
is not much space between the tire and the back edge of it.  A 235 tire would
be even less -- things an easily get wedged there (no matter what your tire
size, but bigger tires will wedge smaller things!)
 
&gt; Also, does anyone know the any of the details regarding the optional 16&quot;
&gt; wheels available on German Syncros - such as specs, construction (steel or
&gt; alloy), whether they have matching hubcaps - etc? Will these wheels fit
&gt; within the stock wells used on US Syncros?
&gt; 
No info at all -- as Tom says, we all want to hear!

&gt; Finally, has anyone looked into purchasing a set of these wheels?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;

I like the look of the bigger wheels, and it doesn't seem to suffer from the
essentially higher gearing, but I drive a LandCruiser off-road for low gears,
it has really low gears available.  It sure winds up less at speed, a real
benefit as far as I'm concerned.  The LandCruiser only goes 55.  The bus is
real tall, though.  It was tall before, and this put it up another inch.  I
sure don't need to jack it up to get underneath!  My Kombi sits something
like 2&quot; taller than a Vanagon Syncro -- about 4&quot; higher than my GL.
