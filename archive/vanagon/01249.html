Subject: Re: Sound Proofing '69 bus


Summertime near the University of Texas campus invariably means that
students will throw out old furniture...with completely good foam
cushions!!  I ripped the old fabric off of the cushions, cut the foam to
fit the spaces in the doors of my '66 Westphalia, and put the door covers
back in place.  Presto!  Instant noise reduction at no cost.  And when I
shut the door I can *almost* fool my passengers into thinking that they're
riding in a Lexus sedan.
