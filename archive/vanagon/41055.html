Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

I, too, had only one experience with Bus Boys.  I ordered a 
windshield gasket, with a different ship-to address from the 
bill-to address.  They shipped it to the bill-to address by 
mistake, and as a result I didn't get it on time.  When I called 
and spoke to the owner, he checked the records, readily admitted 
the mistake, and upon return of the gasket promptly refunded all 
charges, including shipping.  Not the best experience in the world, 
but at least he owned up to his mistake and refunded my money 
promptly.
