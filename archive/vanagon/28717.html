OK how about on a Westy, parrticularly a loaf.  On loaf buses
I used glue up sheet foam, and put it in the side panels.
But as winter hits us I really notice the '78 has that damn
big leaking hole with noting but 1/4&quot; of fiberglass between
the inside and the 20F outside.  Anybody ever done something?
