&gt; Just up route 9 from Saratoga is a place called Saratoga Springs.  They

&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts?
Have camped there. It is really nice,right next to a creek, as I recall.
About 30' from Kelley Park.  I am considering driving down from Eugene,
OR so it would be great to know if this is going to happen or if I
should skip the whole thing.Anyone who is considering going please let
me(and the list) know ASAP. Muchas gracias,
Cris.
