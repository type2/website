&gt; drivetrain. It occcurs at random right around 45 MPH. Pushing in the clutch
&gt; pedal makes no difference. I had new tires installed recently, though since
&gt; it's not a constant vibration I kind of ruled out the balancing. Any clues

     That Was Me.     By removing the drive shaft I was able to
     run the rear axle on jackstands. This would tell you if the problem
     is in the rear axle  or  drive shaft/front axle. Turns out that my
     problem is in a almost new tire.

     Your problem sound like a poor tire balancing job.
