                      RE&gt;&gt; gasoline politics                       11/16/95

Just to throw a little gasoline on the VW  engine case fires already going
here (and to satisfy VW content), hope I don't singe any amorous carribu in
the process either --

Have you noticed that the root of this thread seems to go back to the
wonderful way our elected &quot;representatives&quot; are spending our tax dollars,
their priorities, and interests?

Just yesterday another fine example has come to light -  The government wants
to shut down a restraunt chain called &quot;HOOTERS&quot; beacause of potential hiring
discrimination 
                                                                              
  ^^^^^^^^^^
against potential male employees.   For those of you unfamiliar with the
chain, I am told
            ^^^^^^^^^
 that their claim to fame is not necessarily the food, but the physical
attributes of the ladies  wearing T-shirts and running shorts that they hire
to serve it.  Seems the feds are concerned about discrimination against men
that might want to be hired !  Not only
                                                                              
^^^^^^
 do they want to shut the chain down, they want the business to post a large
&quot;bond&quot; to pay off any possible future claims !!!!

Heck, if they are gonna do that, maybe I'll apply for a job there as a
&quot;waitress&quot; so I can get some of that money!

In summary, for our wonderfull folks in Washington, none of you have &quot;clean
hands&quot;, or as Will Shakespeare put it --&quot; A pox on both your houses!&quot;

Sorry about the flames, Afterburner off.
Harvey
