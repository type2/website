&gt; That's all I have for now.  If you ever see an aircooled in a movie, even
&gt; just for a second, please let me know!!

In What's Up Doc, there is a bus that gets smashed by at least 5 cars
in a chase scene.

The bus is parked on the road in San Fran and the pursuee's 
(Babs Streisand and Ryan Oneill) make a u-turn. The chase cars all make 
a u-turn at the same spot and in the process, smash the bus.

The end of the scene has the owner come out of the house, grab the door 
handle and the bus falls apart.

With the exception of the destroyed bus, a pretty good chase scene.
