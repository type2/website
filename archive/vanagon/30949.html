Subject: Emissions again.

The original purpose of starting this list was because I wanted some
information on how to get my '84 Vanagon to pass emissions testing in MN. 
I just got back from the testing station, and it failed again (after
having passed last year).   The measurement that fails is HC. CO is just 
fine and CO2 is passable. I think that I can probably get it to pass by 
setting the idle higher and adjusting the timing.  Any other quickies I 
should try ?  

Oh well.....
