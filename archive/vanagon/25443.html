&gt;Yesterday I changed the oil in my '88 Vanagon.  I usually put in 4 qts and
&gt;then add more to hit the full line (after running the engine).  Yesterday I
&gt;put 5 in accidentally.  The oil level is a tad over the full line.  Checked
&gt;the manual, it said oil capacity w/filter is 4.8 qts.  Is the .2 qt
&gt;overfill something to worry about?

well ... if it is, then my 96,000 mile 88 is gonna blow up any second now! :)
i've been doing that since i bought it new and now problems yet. actually,
i started doing it back in about 1982 or so on my 80 bus.

i don't think you have anything to worry about.

==============================
I concur with Joel with the following caveat - although a little won't hurt,
that  doesn't mean a lot is better or even good.  If you overfill too much I
have been cautioned you run the risk of it getting past the rear seal and
contaminating your clutch.
