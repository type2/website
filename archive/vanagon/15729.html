Subject: Re: Westfalia rental


&gt;This is a message for anyone living in the San Diego or Bay Area. Do you
&gt;have a phone number to contact a Westfalia rental place? We would be
&gt;needing one for about a week. Thanks in advance - David Carment

Just called several places here in San Diego-- City VW, Rent-a-Wreck, etc.--
and drew an absolute blank on renting any kind of VW van, Westy, etc. of any
year. At each place, I asked the person if he knew of any OTHER place that might
rent me such a VW. Zippo!

If I owned one, I'd rent it to you-- always in line for a quick buck. But
can't even do that!

Wish you better luck than I had...
