How to download software for different platfoarms: 

I will assume you all have WWW browsers, if you don't please email me and i can email you 
the software. 

For Windows: 
There are two well known irc clients (irc client = irc software) 

1.-  mIRC:  point your web browser to: http://www.mirc.co_dot_uk and download mIRC 5.02

2.- PIRCH: point your web browser to: http://www.bcpl.lib.md_dot_us/~frappa/pirch.html

For Mac users (I've seen some mac fans in the list &lt;g&gt; )

1.- IRCLE: http://www.xs4all.nl/~ircle/

For Unix: 

Im sure they can find an ircII ;) 

For OS/2 

I Recommend Internet Adventurer, can't remember the URL but if there are any os2 user, I have the last version and can email it

For VM/CMS mainframes

Believe it or not, There are an IRC client for VM it's called RXIRC and i patched the version 2.1 to work 
with new servers like AnotherNet. So please email me if you are stuck in a VM

Install your software acording to the instructions. Then choose a nick and connect to irc.another_dot_net:6667

Once connected in anothernet type /JOIN #VANAGON  

Why Anothernet ? 

There are several irc networks, but in my opinion AnotherNet is the safest cleanest place with low 
lag and few jerks. The other reason is Anothernet has online services to register nicks etc.. 

I strongly recommend to read first: irc faq (you can find it in same site as mirc and anothernet 
services and policy in http://www.another_dot_net 

Online Help: 

If you need help online in AnotherNet, type /join #Anothernet_Help and ask away your 
questions there, the operators there will answer your questions as sonn as they can. 

See you all there.. my nick there is Phobos.
