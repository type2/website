&gt;...but when I dug through the docs, I found the pamphlet on the Westfalia
conversion, and it calls my van a Campmobile.

now why would VW print up separate pamphlets for Canada and the u.s.? that's
interesting.  anybody else out there got their little books? how bout you
guys in Australia with the late model buses?

i wish we had somebody on the list from South Africa, so they could tell us
about the buses down there. some stuff i've gotten in little magazines seems
to indicate they are a bit peculiar ... well, even more so than the rest of
the world.

so we have a bus leaving the factory as a ... what? Kombi? going to various
companies to be converted. once it's converted, some of those companies ship
the bus to vw dealers to be sold. but who actually does the advertising? VW?
or some ad agency in the receiving country?  i wonder what the buses and
campers are called in spanish-speaking countries ... like mexico, where they
are still building the 1968-1979 body-style buses ... except with water-cooled
engines! (but i have no idea WHICH water-cooled engine ... only that it has
one. rabbit engines?).

maybe we should bang on Terry Schuler's door and get him to put out a book
about the Camping Conversion VW Transporters. :)  he's the guy that did the
little book about the 1949-1967 buses.  anybody know any publishers?
