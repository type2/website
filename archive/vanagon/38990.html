Subject: 95 EV: Adapter for CellPhone

My cellphone adapter( for the lighter), which worked fine in my Chev Blazer,
does not sit tightly in my EV's lighter receptacle (which seems to be shorter in
length). Are there special adapters used in VW's? Do I need to get a whole new
adapter, or is there a supplement to the one I already have that will make it
sit properly in the receptacle?

Megan
