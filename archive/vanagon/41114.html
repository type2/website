Subject:       Re: aerodynamics (Seriously...)

&gt; to following motorcyclists and vanagonauts.  I think there were safety 
&gt; problems with their acceptance (not that I understand why anyone was 
&gt; worried about the *sides*, given the ridiculous range of truck bumper 
&gt; heights allowed in this country).

I'd just like to comment on that, too.

I wouldn't be too concerned about a normal tractor trailer.  The 
wheels are right there anyway.  It would be a cushy crash... :)

But!

Has anyone noticed more and more of these semi/dump-truck trailers 
that swivel up so that one could drive a bull-dozer or other vechile 
onto the trailer, then tip it back level.

These trailors have no bumpers, are right at windshield level and 
the wheels are a good 8 feet under there.

Needless to say one better duck down in their seat if they are going 
to rear-end one of those things.

I am positive that there are specifications about how low a semi's 
bumper must come.  So how do these guys get around the rules?
