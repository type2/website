Subject: Tobin/Christa Copley update!


Greetings:  Christa (of Tobin and Christa Copley) just phoned to give
a trip update.  They've just come up out of Mexico, after having been
there for one month.  Details:

They did not get sick even once.

They loved it.

They are TOTALLY tan.

Christa has painted toenails.

---------

They are next heading up towards the &quot;armpit&quot; of the US.  You know what
that means.  !!!!   :)

If anyone wants to get a message to them, just e-mail me, and I'll
deliver it to them personally when they phone here again in a few
days.
