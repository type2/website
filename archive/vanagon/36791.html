That's an interesting observation; OK, what if VW(US or otherwise) decided
to build the Eurovan in Puebla, MX instead of Hanover,FRG?  That would
probably get some of the cost down, but that's probably not the whole story.

People who drive the Big 3 minivans are probably after a couple main things;
they (supposedly) drive like cars, and they want the ability to drag many
items/
people around w/ them.  OK, so that said, the only reason that I can see for
why the EV went over like a lead balloon here (US) was because of poor mar-
keting (as has already been made abundantly clear), and maybe not enough
&quot;ooomph&quot; to get a 2 ton vehicle to merge w/ traffic fast enough to people's
liking.  I don't know that a VR6 is going to do it for VWUS, either, because
it doesn't appear to be an inexpensive engine for an inexpensive vehicle.

Hmm, I wonder if I can get a big bore kit for that I-5 in my EV?...
