Subject: $$$$ for OEM Carpet
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 1997 09:36:03 -0600

Talk about Sticker Shock!  When the parts guy at my dealer said I would
laugh when I saw the price of the front carpet section for my 90 Carat
from the factory, I knew it would be expensive, but I was prepared.
BUT, when he stumbled out the $515 price, and to boot &quot;if I can get it&quot;,
I did in fact LAUGH!  Now, I am wondering about alternatives.  Anybody
know of any good ones?

Thanks in advance,

Ed
