&gt;Ok. I've seen at least 3 times that Wolfsburg replacment tin doesn't  
&gt;fit worth a hang.  Does J.C Whitless's fit any better? Any other  
&gt;recommendations?  I can't find a machine that doesn't need at least  
&gt;some tin replaced.

You din't say bus or bug or whatever, and I've ever done are bus panels,
sooo....

I would recommend Das Bulli Haus, 

        Das Bulli Haus
        18 Ward Lane
        North Franklin, CT 06254

The panels I did get from them fit great; thats not too much of a data point,
but anything has to be better than Wolfsburg West!!  Oye!
