&gt; Now that I know that it will (almost) match my upholstery:
&gt;  Any suggestions on where to get one of these for my '91 Westie? Price
&gt;  range?
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;  Cris.

I've paid $100-$150 each for my seats.  It's a long story, but I ended up
with three of them, so I have a spare.  I'd let it go for $100. + Shipping +
Packging.  Seat has seatbelts but no mounting brackets.  Owner will need 1
top mounting bracket and two floor brackets.  I think dealer cost on these
total around $70.

I live in Southern California.
