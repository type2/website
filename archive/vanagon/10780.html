&gt;1) to the right of the spedo, there is a dummy gauge, was there a factory
&gt;option gauge for this hole?

this is where the optional clock would go. you can also fit a small VDO
tachometer in here.

&gt;2) Just under the said gauge hole, there is a red light thingy with a &quot;B&quot; on
&gt;it.  Anyone know what this is?

it's a brake circuit warning light. if one of the brake pressure sensors
(that make your taillights go on) 'fails' (whatever that means), the little
'B' light comes on ... which tells you that you have only HALF of your
normal braking power left. :(   if you push on the 'B', it should light up
... as a self-test.

&gt;3) I found out that I have a frozen heater cable on the right side.  Any
&gt;ideas short of replacing it?

a gallon of liquid wrench? Kroil? probably better to replace it, maybe both
cables. or suffer until spring (when you won't need the heat)? :)
