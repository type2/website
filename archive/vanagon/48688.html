Hello all,

I was on this list earlier this summer with a lagging problem on my 73'
VW Westy/Transporter. Runs fine but, when under load it bogs down. Well I
never had time to get a good look at it, and its just been sittin around
till recently. I took it for a spin and found out I could actually
accelerate at a constant rate if I only applied the gas pedel a little
bit, It seemed to be back to normal, only boggin when I gassed it harder!
 I notice at night is the best time to drive it, it runs better. I figure
it has to do with the carbs, maybe they need to be synced or adjusted?
Any input would be greatly appretiated.


Peace,
Rich
