&gt; So why would putting dense moisture on a hot surface make that

&gt; Apropos the water injector system - on Westys you could use the water pump

Ok It works like this.  What happens to the cooling fin when it is cooler 
than the air around it?  It absorbs heat right.  If it's absorbing heat 
back from the air it isn't radiating heat into the air right.  Thermo 
dynamics are wonderfull things but kinda tricky.  You want to keep the 
flow of heat in one direction and cooling the fins externaly just slows 
down their heat radiating ability from the internal heat source.  As I 
said if you can just pump very humid air around the fins then you would 
get the efficiency you want.  Putting a water jacket around an air cooled 
engine makes it a water cooled engine!
