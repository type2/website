&gt;On Monday morning I started my '87 Syncro to discover an &quot;idle&quot; speed of
4400
&gt;RPM.  I drove the van for close to three hours and the problem was
&gt;consistant.  I've switched out the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve with one
&gt;known to be good and had the same problem.  Next I disconnected the pair of
&gt;wires attached to the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve and the van idled
&gt;normally while warm.  I suspect that this means that I have a problem with
&gt;the Idle Control Module or perhaps the throttle position switch. 
&gt;
&gt;
I had this exact same thing happen this morning, but I don't have an extra
Idle Stabilizer Control Valve to check with.  If anyone could help, let us
know.
