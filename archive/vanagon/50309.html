As I was first to comment on the horrendous Dansk quality may I
add that indeed it took a stack of 2 at the Y PLUS the drilling out
of the mounting holes on the head studs, PLUS fitment all untightened,
and still the results are poor.  I will from this point forward go
with the much cheaper american? made stuff from California Import
or if their stuff is Dansk as well at least will not pay as much.
