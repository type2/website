&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;with a bill for $380!  No parts were included.
&gt;
&gt;What do you think? 
&gt;
&gt;Does this seem exhorbitant?  
&gt;
Ed,

You got hosed.  I had my Westy fridge repaired recently.  In an area of
over 1 million people there was only 1 place that claimed to be Dometic
182B experts.  This was confirmed when I pulled in to a service area full
of Westys (12 of them).  This was also reconfirmed when it took the
mechanic only 10 minutes to pull the fridge. 

Yes it did cost me C$430 (US$305) but they warned me in advance it would
take about 3.5 hours (at C$59 / US$42 per hour) labour or longer if there
were major problems.  They replaced about C$175 in parts.  I had sourced
the parts via mail order and the dealer had a better price.  They called to
ask my permission to install (and charge me for) the parts.

That's the way it should be.  Start screamin'.  The BBB, state consumer
departments, RV chat groups, or whatever.  I had a friend who got hosed by
a dealer on a new car where the engine blew after 53 weeks (52 week
warranty).  One Saturday he went down to the dealership with a picket sign.
 In about 15 minutes the dealer figured he had suffered enough damage to
his reputation that he agreed to pick up the cost.  Go for it.
