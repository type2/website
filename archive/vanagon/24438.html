Yes indeedy, for you fine folks who ordered the list shirts, I picked
them up from the screenprinter's yesterday.
I must say they are indeed fine!
Sooooooo, I am now faced with the enormous task of mailing 50-some
shirts. I will try to get them out soon, but quite possibly it will be
next Monday (Not this coming Monday), because I will be going home for a
few days, and my parents are equipped to deal with mass-mailing type
situations. I will be mailing them out third class, so allow perhaps 2-3
weeks? I have no idea how long they will take.
Feel free to e-mail me as soon as you get yours.
Also, since so many people missed the deadline, I may do another run in
6 months or so. We'll see how that looks then. I am also considering
doing stickers...
Anyway, for those who care, here are the final statistics:
Note - actual cost of shirts was less than I thought because we got so
many. Prices dropped .50 per shirt at 37, and then again at 50, so the
actual cost was less than when I thought we would only be getting 20.

Screen charge (5 _at_ $15)     = $75.00
Art charge                  = $50.00
46 standard shirts (_at_ 7.25) = $333.50
8 XXL shirts       (_at_ 8.50) = $68.00
Sales Tax                   = $31.59
Grand Total                 = $558.09
Number of shirts ordered    = 54
Avg. Price per shirt        = $10.34

I have no idea on how much it will cost to mail them, but was told about
$3.00 each. Anyway, be on the lookout in a few weeks...
Richard
