&gt;However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
&gt;submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
&gt;electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
&gt;on the word processor.

Bob,

I would have to heartily disagree with the last paragraph of your response.
I look forward to ANY trip reports relating to buses, VWs in general, or
even stuff that's entertaining.  Some people are just too lazy/pigheaded to
write anything positive -- it's really easy to be negative.  If someone took
the time to read the entire trip report and then felt so strongly to write
you and bitch about the meterological discrepancies between what they
experienced and what you experienced -- you just have to wonder.

If I was really anal I'd post a message complaining about all the fun
stories about West coast camping that get posted to the list...I live on the
East coast, dammit--I can't go!!  Or maybe I'd complain about stuff that
doesn't pertain to my particular set of conditions...  I don't.  I filter
messages.

Censoring your writing would do all of us a great disservice and I say nope,
uh uh, don't do it.  All in favor forward a copy of the Bill of Rights to
the President. ;)

Oh yeah, anybody that doesn't like trip reports or &quot;other stuff&quot; should
unsubscribe from the list and use the WWW version at --&gt;
http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/
then you can print out all the messages, get yourselves a bunch of red pens,
proofread the messages, make corrections, write complaints on them and be
quiet about it.

p.s. I just spent 4 days at Mardi Gras and I haven't detoxified yet so if
this message seems garbled, blame it on the hand grenades...or the lucky dogs.
