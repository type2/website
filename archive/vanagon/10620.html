&gt; Curb Weight                      4837 lb  &lt;====== ????
&gt; 
&gt; What does curb weight mean here? Does it mean its weight of just all its
&gt; equipments alltogether? Or does it include all it can carry including human
&gt; beings? I had the impression that there is a sticker somewhere in the driver's
&gt; door frame where a curb weight number is shown there. And in some countries
&gt; that curb weight is used to determine if it should be ticketed for over weight
&gt; when the vehicle is weighted in road check points. In other words, it is a
&gt; limit of total weight it should not exceed when it's loaded. The number for
&gt; vanagons is somewhere between 5000 to 6000 lbs. Am I correct?
&gt; 

	Curb weight is with fluids but without passengers. 
	GrossVehicleRating or GrossWeightRating is the maximum weight 
	of the fully laden vehicle.

	GrossWeight - Curb Weight = allowable payload
