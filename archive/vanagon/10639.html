Subject:       request for the 'accessory' Westy seat

One drawback to the full Westy vs the Weekender is the lack of 
seating.  Does anyone have the single accessory seat that mounted 
behind the front passenger seat for Vanagon Westys?

I would be willing to pay and unreasonable and outrageous sum for one 
as it will keep family harmony and separate a 2 year old and a 5 year 
from sitting right next to each other!

Private email fine to save wear and tear on Gerry's Machine.
