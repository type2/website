Subject: the all euro engine swap

I have been reading posting here on and off for the past few months.  Great
stories about engine swapping.  Has anyone considered using a Volvo V6.  They
had a 2.7-2.8 liter motor in their Volvo 260 from the late 70's into the late
80's.  There has got to be a pretty good supply of them here in the states.
 They run on Bosch Jetronic-K CIS fuel injection.  I think they were rated at
about 125 HP.  The only bad thing I can think of about them is that they are
actually of Renault/Citreon manufacture.  I saw a rusty 260 in the sunday
paper for about $500  'runs good, but very rusty'  

Anyone have any comments on what would be necessary on a conversion like
this?
