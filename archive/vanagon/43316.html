As seen in today's Baltimore Sun....

'75 VW BUS AT, as is, $500, call after 5
410-666-5923

This bus is probably great for parts or for anyone needing an AT tranny.
It is right by my house, so I could take a look at it.

Also, I should mention a Vanagon Westy for sale:

VW Vanagon Camper pop top, 4 spd, new clutch, insp., $4300 
410-461-5727
