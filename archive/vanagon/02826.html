Subject: Re: getting a life?

Ahhh...shit...I feel another song comming on...sorry to George Harrison..

What Is Life

What I feel I can't say
But I drive my bug any time of day
If its not a bug that you need
Then I'll try my best to get my EuroVan to succeed...

Tell me what is my life
with out a vee-dub....
