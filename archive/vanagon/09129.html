I'm going through some of the same things.  I didn't have any rear 
heater, so I bought one from a junkyard and it leaks, so I removed it.  
Now I've decided that getting it running is more trouble than it's 
worth.  The core is about $142 from the dealer.  The van is plenty warm 
without it...(my opinion.)
