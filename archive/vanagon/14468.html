Subject: Re: vanagon brakes

try pumping the brakes gently a few times with the motor off to drain the 
vac booster. Keep your foot on the brake pedal and start the engine. The 
pedal should 'soften' and you can push a bit deeper. This is how I roughly 
gauge if vac boost is working. If you are hitting the 'stop' it sounds like 
the master cyl. is leaking internally. Can you lock both rears?   tim s.
