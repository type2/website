Subject: RE: massive oil leak (77 camper)

John Dziadecki asks what he could have done about a dropped sump plug.  My
general answer is that nothing you have foreseen ever happens, so carrying
epoxy and a spare plug would have prevented the problem, as would carrying
a spare engine.  But carrying a spare engine will not keep the front suspen-
sion from breaking, and if you carry a welding rig, what you'll need is a 
drill press.  S--t happens.

Cellular phone seems like a good idea if you're going where the weather can
kill you.  I keep a sleeping bag in the van, which by the first paragraph's
logic ensures I'll never have to spend a cold night in the van.
