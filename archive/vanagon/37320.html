&gt;&gt; When I push it down to that lowest

&gt;&gt;either.  What is it supposed to do?  Am I turning someone's wipers on
&gt;&gt;and off in South Africa?
&gt;
&gt;My '73 is the same. I always thought it could be for intermittent wipers
&gt;that my bus, being a cheapo no-frills 1600 version, didn't get. I know VW
&gt;did that with the reversing lights. My bus has the lights, just with no
&gt;bulbs or holders inside. When I bought it I thought there must just be a
&gt;blown fuse or duff wire or something until I read somewhere that they were
&gt;an option. In reality that meant you had to stump up more cash, on top of
&gt;what you were already paying for your new bus, just for VW to connect them up. 
&gt;I've never bothered to examine the wiper switch but it may turn out that by
&gt;just adding a few extra wires in the right places you end up with
&gt;intermittent wipers for free. Has anyone's bus got a wiper switch that does
&gt;something when you move it down?

You guys aren't by chance refering to the wash function, are you?  I know that
on later busses the hose from the windshield washer tank runs up to a valve
on the column and from there to the jets on the windshield.  If the washer
tank wasn't pressurized, then moving the lever wouldn't appear to do anything.
But I can't remember if this is the same lever as for the wipers, or a
different stalk.
