Subject: Trip Report: Inuviking the Bus

Hey now,
     It's been a busy couple of days. We arrived in LA on Sun. evening, and
Monday morning I went junkyard hunting for a Westy camper interior while Sam
visited friends. I found a pretty complete '74 Westy, pulled the interior,
took it back to my grandparents house and installed it. Lots of work, but we
now have a nicer camping interior. 
     So, we finally hit Victorville on Tuesday. It is now Wednesday evening,
and much has happend to our bus. New front wheel bearings, all 4 drums
turned, brakes adjusted, alternator installed, KYB white shocks on the front,
1 new CV boot, a new tranny, and flanges welded onto the exaust to replace
those annoying clamps that VW used. A temp guage was planned, but no sender
units were in stock, so that'll have to wait.  All said, I feel like the bus
is better prepared to take on Canada. One thing I learned while I worked
aside &quot;real&quot; mechanics, I'm slow. But, I had to keep consulting Sir Bentely,
so that's part of it. I'm also pretty inefficent, since I don't do this for a
living. Many thanks to my friend Darryl at Meredith Auto in Victorville, for
his help, use of his shop, and decent parts prices. Good company too, we used
to tour Dead shows in his '66 bus. Sure do miss all those shows. So, that's
about it for now, tomorrow I'll finish up on the bus, then we'll head for
Sequia and Kings Canyon Nat. Parks, so no trip reports will be sent for the
next few days. See y'all on the road...
Peace, 
Eddie
