Subject: Dealer offers 10K for 91 Carat with 11.8K book value....is it a rip....
Date: Wed, 26 Oct 94 19:37:40 PDT

So JJ MATCHETT says:
&gt; 
&gt; A ford Dealer offered me 10K for my 91 Vanagon Carat that has a wholesale
&gt; blue book value of 11.8K...Are they trying to rip me off?? They say that there
&gt; is not a market for VW Vanagons...and didnot believe that the blue book value
&gt; is realistic....(my van is in good shape).....Does anybody have any advice??
&gt; 

Dealers will say anything and do anything to get you to believe their slimey
lies.  DO NOT fall for it.  Walk away never EVER trade your car in.  Always
sell it privately.  It is a myth that selling your car privately is a hassel.
If you want to sell your car for the most profit, just put a For Sale sign on
it with a a price higher than you expect to get for it and I assure you that
you will get offers varying from obsurd to damn enticing.  If you trade your
car in you will always get stiffed in the process one way or another.
