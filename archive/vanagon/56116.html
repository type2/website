Subject: bus for sale

I am selling a 74 Westy in excellent condition for $3,400.00.  It has 6K
mi on a rebuilt motor, a new Weber carb, new paint, new tires, an
original interior, and a Pioneer CD ready stereo.  All interior
appliances work.  It is well worth the money.  If you are interested,
please Email me.  The bus is currently garaged in southern NH.
