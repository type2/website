now, all of you who have bothered to read this far will have noticed that
there are more Unknowns than there are Microbuses. People, this is not good!
A Stain upon the Brotherhood of Buses! Come One, Come ALL! Declare yourselves
to the World!!! Come out of the Garage!! Let the Light of Public Scrutiny
shine Full upon the Face of your Bus!!!  Ye are among Friends, here, and
None (but certain individuals who shall remain nameless for the moment) would
dare to scoff or guffaw at any true Believer of the Bus!!!

so, All of you what ain't told me your Bus type and year, get them cards and
letters coming in. :)

wouldn't hurt to let me know what country, state/province, and large city you
frequently inhabit ... just in case the Bus Believers of that area decide to
consume mass quantities of beer and pizza some night. now, you wouldn't want
to miss THAT, would you??? :)
