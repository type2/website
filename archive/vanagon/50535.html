RE:	Copy of: Re: Battery Removal

Hey , we should start a &quot;DUH&quot; section of the list  &quot;Dumb things done while
working on your Van&quot; I've got a few good ones myself.  How about attempting to
change a fuel filter on a late bus in 30 degree weather with a full gas tank and
discovering the fuel hose is rotten? ( gas is -real- cold when it's pouring all
over your head!)  Or removing an '84 Vanagon overhead A/C assembly and saying to
myself &quot; I'll just cut this here ground wire and re-solder it later&quot; only to
find out the &quot;ground wire&quot; was a pressurized thermostat capillary tube, and of
course, it's NLA from the dealer. 

Anybody else have any good stories?
Let's hear 'em on Friday!
