Subject: Re: More Semaphore Questions

I have semaphore holes in the '57 single cab. No nose cones are on the front
of the bus. I also, long ago, purchased a set of Type I semaphores with out
knowing that there was a difference between bus and bug semaphores. I have
been told that the the Type I semaphore slots should have a hole on the
bottom and a  flattened U shaped retention point weled/braized into the top
of the inner mounting area. It is my impression that on a Type I the
semaphores are supposed to slide into the U on the top and screw into place
on the bottom. The singlecab has a hole for a screw mount on top as well as
on the bottom. The flattened U mounting point is missing on both sides of
the bus. I am unable to install the semaphores that I own into the bus
because it appears that I need semaphores which have screw mounts on top as
well as on bottom. After I converted the single to 12V I kinda let the
&quot;hole&quot; subject slip to the bottom of the to do list.
Can anyone &quot;Clara-fy&quot; the two following questions point as well?

1. Do bus semaphores slide into the U shaped mounting point like a bug or do
they have a screw hole on the top and the bottom?

2. Why would I NOT have the flattened U rentention thingus in the semaphore
mounting holes?

3. Do ALL semaphore body slots have a 1/8&quot; rounded edge of body metal around
the outside of it or are some (any?) flat/sharp edged?
