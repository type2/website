&gt; Well, I think that &quot;seeking professional help&quot; may be a little extreme.  :)
&gt; The determining factors to me were price, and legality.  Considering it
&gt; would cost me $35 to rebuild my dual Solexes, versus paying at least ten 
&gt; times that much for new carbs (and possibly more for manifolds), and then
&gt; not being able to pass a smog check, it seemed ludicrous to even consider
&gt; *not* rebuilding the stockers.  Sure, I might be able to eek out a few
&gt; more horses with an aftermarket setup, but I have already accepted the
&gt; fact that my bus will never be a hotrod.  A few extra horses are not
&gt; worth all the extra trouble and expense.  Besides, my mileage would
&gt; probably suffer, and who knows how the extra power would affect engine
&gt; life?  I luv my Solexes... 21 mpg highway... fly through smog...  NYAH!

First, I couldn't rebuild mine for $35 apiece because it's the $hafts that
need to be rebuilt, and that can't be done with a kit, but only by a
carb machine shop (so I'm told).  Second, I hadn't thought about the
ramifications of replacing my twin Solexes with that tempting two-barrel
single setup.  Since I am also in CA and have to make a decision as to
what route to take (or else continue fouling plugs and getting 12 mpg),
I'd appreciate it if someone can let me know how difficult it might
be to get a replacement setup to pass the inspection.  I'd love the idea
of actually staying with traffic in the merging lane, but is it a
realistic possiblity?

BTW, thanks to all of you for the support and advice in my time of
crisis. I'm feeling much better now, thank you.
