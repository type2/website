&gt; Did anyone check the headers on this one?  The ending was 
&gt; hr.house_dot_gov.  Are we being watched?  Gerry, did you unwittling let 
&gt; one of them onto the list?  Does Newt have an '85 with starting 
&gt; problems and decided to fix it himself?  Inquiring minds...
&gt; -- 
If Newt has an '85, then it obviously has a problem with everything on 
its &quot;right&quot; side.  Oh God, please don't let him on the list, living in 
the same state has been enough of a hardship!
