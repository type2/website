This is going out to the original poster as well as the list, just in 
case there's someone else who'd be interested in these.  They're both in 
Northern Colorado.  If someone buys the one with the Porsche in it, you 
have to give me a ride :).

1978 Camper.  Rebuilt Porsche engine, sink, stove, fridge. $2900.

1980 Deluxe Westphalia.  New top, clean interior, 1500 miles on new engine.
$4900.  970.493.3614
