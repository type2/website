&gt; connectors.  Man, oh man did it ever work great!  The connectors had 
&gt; white corrosion and looked pretty bad until I saturated them in the pink 
&gt; stuff and let them soak for about 10 minutes before rinsing them off in 
&gt;

Just remember to protect them, now that they are clean, plus I'd
add a teaspoon of baking soda to the rinse water just to make sure
all the acid action stops.  Then blow dry and smear a light coat
of petroleum jelly on both connector and spade it goes over.
Just a couple of thoughts.
