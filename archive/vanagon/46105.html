Subject: what heads should I order?

After extensive calling to find the cheapest heads on the market, I need some
information on who carries stuff that is good as opposed to what stuff is &quot;bad&quot;
This is of course just your opinion but I would still appriciate what your 
experiance has been with the particular products listed below.

By the way my bus is a '77 Westy with a 2L FI engine:

Mark Stevens:  I've heard only good things from them, what do you think.
their heads seem reasonably priced.

Hoy Fox:  Has any one had experiance with them (their heads in particular)?

NOPI:  There heads are very inexpensive and rebuilt by &quot;southwest imports auto&quot;
are they any good?  All of there parts are very inexpensive.

Strictly Foreign:  Any previous experiance with this company out there?

MOFOCO:  inexpensive heads without exchange.  Has anybody used their heads?

Cali Import Parts:  also inexpensive but I know nothing about them?

Please send me your &quot;opinion!!!&quot; on any of these dealers.  While I am sure
they are all reputable dealer I want to get the most for my limited money.

What should I ask for when ordering heads. Is there anything special?

thanks,
Brett Thorsland
