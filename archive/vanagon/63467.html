Subject: &lt;need&gt; air intake runners, 2.1L

Hi all, 

	Cleaning up the '87 wassers engine area I pulled the air/FI system off
for new lines/seals and a coat of paint.  Also scoured off the
block/heads for a leak check, bone dry! :). Imagine my surprise when
sandblasting off the bran flakes of rust from the runners to discover
several pinholes right through near the bolt down ends!!

	So who's got a set of pristine NOS ones they want to sell me for a
pittance?  C'mon, please!  Anyone near a blown engine that's being
parted out?  Don't know if a 1.9L set are the same, likely so. Either
that or I keep sandblasting and then fill with braze, which is fine. 
And what's the lowest recorded price for the injector seals? Dealer
sucks big on this one! Four rubber Cheerios for $60Cdn, jeesh.

bye, Tim
