Subject: High Water Temp

Hello All,

My recently purchased '86 Westy is running well. I love to
drive it, and I'll never go back to tent camping. But it
does have one problem, on long gradual up hills the water
temperature gauge will go way over to the right and the
red warning light will blink. This has happened twice,
and both times I slowed from 60~65 to 55~60 and turned
the heat on. The temperature dropped and the light stopped
blinking. Also the gauge is normally to the right of the
red light, about 1/2 way between the light and the max temp
band. Is that normal?

I've looked around in the FAQ/archives and it seems to me
that I should have the thermostat replaced. Is that true?
I was thinking that I should have the radiator pulled, taken
to a radiator specialist, flushed and tested. Is this a 
good idea? I've talked to one shop and they said they could
do it but that they use recycled phosphate free antifreeze,
would this be OK or should I insist on the Autobahn stuff?

Thanks
John Sharpe
