Scattered Thoughts and Feeble Fragments ...


         Propanity

A little tank, beneath my floor,
Contains a gas that some deplore,
A gas that smells like Eau d' Skunk,
or rotted cabbage in a trunk.

And yet we use it every day
For cooking, cooling in some way;
Throughout this land and countryside,
It's used in homes, both far and wide.

Why, even in our homes on wheels
It's often used to fix our meals.
It can your food both heat and cool,
As long as you don't play the fool.

A bottled bomb, Pandorah's box,
A genie's boon or cursed pox?
It all depends on how we treat
This gaseous source of traveling heat.

Our comforts hinge on this, we find,
So much we can't leave it behind,
And there bespeaks dependency
On this so-called Propanity!


          Propanity, too

Malodorous hydrocarbon gas
&gt;From crude petroleum derives,
Akin to waxy paraffin:
A cautious comfort in our lives.
