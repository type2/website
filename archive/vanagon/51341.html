Subject:      buses for sale in Alabama

ok, for all you Wanabusers ... this is what's been in the papers lately
... opinions offered only on the there i've seen:

1991 Vanagon GL, Bourdeaux Red Metallic. automatic transmission.
     45,000 miles. listed at $10,800. Cadillac Dealer. i drove the bus
     and it drives fine, engine is clean, no leaks, dirt, oil, etc.
     has power heated mirrors. 7-passenger seating, with fold-down rear
     bench. does NOT have cruise, power windows, alloy wheels.
     demerits for:
       minor scratches on body work, headlights a little foggy, a/c
       pully/compressor/belt squealed like a pig when first cranked.
       after engine running for a few minutes, a/c made no further noise.
       blows cold air.
     Hoover, AL (Birmingham). Crest Cadillac. (205) 979-7979. Nicky Notto.

1991 Vanagon Multi-Van, Orly Blue Metallic. automatic transmission.
     65,000 miles. listed at $12,995. they WILL take less (i offered $9,000
     and they &quot;had to have at least $9,500&quot;. VW Dealer. i drove the bus and
     it drives ok. shocks seem weak (or either camper tops are a LOT more
     weight up there than i remember). brakes ok. power ok. power door locks,
     windows, mirrors. alloy wheels (including spare). AS-IS/NO WARRANTY!
     pop-top, rear-facing middle seats, swing up middle table, one rear
     storage cabinet. cruise control. does NOT have the Magic Harness fitted
     (for the steady speed stuttering problem)
     demerits for:
       serious bashed front bumper (liveable but it looks really bad ...
       like it caught concrete or something); lots of scratches on body
       paint; skylight busted; small tears in pop-top canvas (only three
       small ones that i saw); middle seat adjustment busted on one seat;
       carpet edging torn badly between front seats; one low-beam headlight
       burned out; front passenger right armrest busted off (and hidden
       under rear seat); parking brake plastic cover busted off (and hidden
       under rear seat).

1991 Vanagon Camper GL, Flash Silver Metallic. automatic transmission.
     65,000 miles. listed at $11,995. they will take less. i offered
     $10,000 and they &quot;had to have at least $10,500&quot;. power door locks,
     mirrors, windows; cruise control. full camper outfit with sink, stove,
     fire extinguisher, cabinets, dual tables, swivel front seats (which
     might not work! i couldn't get them to swivel ... but then i probably
     don't know how); AS-IS/NO WARRANTY. alloy wheels (including spare).
     inside rear hatch release; has the Magic Harness fitted to stop the
     stuttering at steady speeds.
     demerits for:
       coolant low, crusted coolant on all of engine compartment; steering
       fluid low. left front mudflap is broken at top (the screw) and has
       scratched the body pretty badly (fixable); rear hatch shocks are
       dying;
     test drive: low power in engine, like timing is not set right. the
     story is that some poor woman was driving through Alabama and the
     &quot;engine blew up&quot; so the considerate dealer bought it from her &quot;at
     a good price&quot; and she just left by other means. that same dealer then
     spent $4500 (their figure) putting a &quot;new engine&quot; into the bus. what
     it looks like is a rebuilt short block with the old peripherals (which
     did NOT even have the coolant cleaned off them) put back on. i'd say,
     from the looks of it, that a coolant hose ruptured and spewed coolant
     ALLLL over the place. whether or not that is really a rebuilt engine,
     i can't say.

notice, if you will, that the full camper is $1,000 LESS than the Multi-van.
same year, same mileage (coincidence?), same transmission. you figure it
out. Jack Ingram VW/Porsche/Mazda/Nissan/Mercedes/Jaguar/DeSoto/Studebaker/
Hupmobile (lotsa brands at this one!), Montgomery, AL (334) 277-5700.

i don't like to be jerked around by car dealers, especially when i've made
what i consider to be a more-than-fair offer on the damned cars. so i passed
on both of them.

1986 Vanagon Camper. pop top, sleeps 4, exc. cond. Good ride. good mileage.
     $5,995. (205) 942-1205. Birmingham paper.
     (i have NOT seen this one)

1984 Vanagon GL, 4 cyl, 4 speed, runs great, $1500. (205) 562-0231
     Birmingham paper (i have NOT seen this one).

1974 VW Camper Van. doesn't run. body in good cond. needs $500 in work.
     $1000. (205) 933-5719. Birmingham paper (haven't see this one, either).

so that's it. all you Vanderbilts and Rockefellers can scoop them up now. :)
