&gt; I'm still trying to unravel what's causing the CO on my 81 (AFC,

&gt; today and see if one of them is locked open or has a bad spray pattern.  
&gt; BTW, hydrocarbons are in spec, if that makes any sense.  I don't have a 
&gt; CO/oxygen sensor to use to figure out the problem.  I've leaned the 
&gt; adjusting screw all the way out and can only get the CO to 1.75 
&gt; (spec=1.5) at idle, higher at higher rpms.  Compression is ~100 on all 

If you leaned out the idle adjustment, that should make the CO go up.
Lean causes the CO to go up, rich causes the HC to go up.
