&gt;I just bought a set of reinforced Michelin X tires for my 86 Westfalia. The
&gt;max tire pressure is 40 psi, yet the sticker on the door calls for 48 psi in
&gt;the rear tires. The dealer (Wheelworks, a large chain in the SF Bay Area)
&gt;insists that they are the correct tires. What's going on here?
