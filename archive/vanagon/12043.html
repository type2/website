I hate to ask this, but how do I do this on a 2.0L?
We have just been rolling the bus until we think they
are pretty close to TDC, and doing the feeler gauge thing.

Is this how it happens?  Right now, I have to give a fairly
high pain in the ass rating becuase I can never tell when we are
at TDC, other than you seem to hit spot where its easy to move.

Thanks
Matt
