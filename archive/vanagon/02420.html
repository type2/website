Subject: solar showers

Just a few thoughts on solar heating of water:
your best setup is a clear dome with a flat (reflection-wise) black 
absorber in contact with the substance to be heated (water). The solar 
energy will pass thru clear and be absorbed by black.  reradiated energy 
from the black stays close to to it and can be reabsorbed.  A black dome 
separated from the water would absorb the heat but nowhere near the water 
you want heated.  the uncovered black bag works, but without a clear 
cover, any reradiated energy is lost to the air (and goes away fast at 
any wind speed).
