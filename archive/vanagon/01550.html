Subject: Re: Rear Drums wont come off.

&gt;Hi,    I know the feeling, just nothing to get a grip on!
One 'mechanic'? showed me a quick way, just took a large
ball-pein hammer and belted the suckers hard 2 - 3 times
hard on the face, nearish the wheel studs. The drum sprang
of the hub beautifully! Scared the hell out of me though,
since I figured cast iron would shatter like anything. I
was desperate by that time, having used hammer, chisels, 
oil, an oxy-acet. torch to no avail. Once they do come loose, 
(or split in two?) the ridge of crud will bind against
the shoes unless you can get the adjusters backed off.
Rotating the drum back and forth while pulling helps.
The moral of this story is, phone around to find a spare
pair of drums in the vicinity, if so then you've got nothing
to lose so belt'em hard. Otherwise.. persevere and remember
&quot;necessity is the mother of invention&quot; Buy new shoes and clips,
also maybe a pair of rebuilt wheel cylinders? If they're leaking
slightly, you'll just waste the new shoes any how! Check the
parking brake cable motion. Now, if anyone knows where to get
 stainless steel adjusters......   tim s.

ps. I still use this 'belt'em hard' technique, and every time
I keep my fingers crossed, just a natural pessimist I guess.
