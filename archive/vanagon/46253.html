&gt; Can someone post the details on this?

The applications are available at most VW dealerships - I've seen them 
on the service counter and on the parts counter.

IMHO the interest rate is a little high - 17.9%. There is (was?) a 
limited time 9.9% APR for six months on balance transfers, cash advances 
and &quot;premium access checks&quot; but you do not get the 5% rebate towards a 
new VW with this...

BTW, I don't have one of these cards.. I have too many others..
