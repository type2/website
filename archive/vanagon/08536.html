lurky me. :)

&gt;How come, first thing in the morning (temp. about 30 degrees F), my Bus
&gt;doesn't want to roll?  It's almost like the brakes are dragging.  After
&gt;it's been on the road for awhile, this symptom goes away.  Could it be
&gt;the transmission?  I've noticed that it's making more noise than it used
&gt;to, and if I grab the shift knob and put a little pressure on it, the
&gt;noise gets much worse.  I'm hoping it's something minor like it needs
&gt;fluid or something.  Does the xmsn fluid ever degrade and get gummy
&gt;when cold?

you might have too heavy weight trans fluid in there ... or too old. yes,
it (trans oil) is just like any other oil: it gets hot and breaks down and
gets old, etc.  i've always heard it recommended to change ALL fluids on a
car at least every two years (some fluids much more often).

i've done it several times myself, and basically it's a pain in the neck ...
wasn't so bad on the 71 and 80 models, but this 88!!! the shifter gets in
the way of the fill plug and the exhaust blocks the drain plug. :(  and
when i did do it, i used the 'Old' spec oil ... which was too heavy, it turns
out. and my 88 did sort of like what you describe. it was also VERY hard to
shift gears when it was cold.

since your bus does it only when cold, i'd go for a tranny oil change first.
shouldn't cost tooooo much, especially if you do it yourself. be sure to get
that big-mutha 17mm hex allen wrench from sears (or wherever). you'll need it.
also make sure you get the right oil.  i used a 'slurp' gun to put the oil in.
if you can find a better way, use it. :)
