Subject: Free Vanagon Rear Hatch

I've got a rear hatch from a late model Vanagon that's &quot;Free to Good Home&quot;.
I bought it from a wrecking yard for the rear wiper assembly and power lock
latch assembly.  The yard wouldn't sell me those pieces alone so I had to buy
the whole thing.  It's in pretty good shape, one small dent, and the glass is
intact.  You'll have to pick it up if you can use it.
