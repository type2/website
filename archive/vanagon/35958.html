&gt;Also,  I searched the 95 archives and found a post that recommended calling 
&gt;Burlington _at_ 800-343-3033.  They do have good prices:  $38.98 ea. (local 
&gt;FLAPS $69 ea.)  for the rear KYB gas-adjust and will pick up the shipping 
&gt;(they do charge $5 HAZMAT shipping).  BUT, the book didn't have a KYB for 
&gt;the front.  In reading recent posts and checking the archives, GR2's were 
&gt;recommended for the front, but Burlington couldn't confirm this.  Rich _at_ 
&gt;Burlington recommended the BOGE for the front, but they cost     ****** 
&gt;   $80.25 ea.   *******
&gt;
&gt;Can KYB GR2's be used on the front of an 87 syncro van?
&gt;
&gt;

To the best of my knowledge, the only front shocks readily available for the
front of a syncro are the original equipment.  Boge and Sachs do make other
choices, not readily available here.  BTW, the rears are the same lenght and
mounting as Chevy Astro Vans.  You can get other choices for this listing.
