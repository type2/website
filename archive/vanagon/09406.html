Subject: Brake master cylinder rebuild?

  I have a '67, which has a one-year only master cylinder. It is the first year
for a dual-chamber MC (one for front brakes, one for back), but it is different
from the late model MC's. Mine leaks from the front seal, so something must be
done, but the cost for this year only is around $150.00 and up. I do not want
to retro-fit a late model MC, as it does require a bit of fudging to get it in.
Anyway, my point in all this is that surely somewhere one can get rebuild kits
for master cylinders. I realize it is not recommended to do this, but I have
heard of it being done anyway. So, if anyone possibly has any leads on where to
get such a kit, please do let me know. Thanks,
Richard
