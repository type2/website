Subject: Re: Which Subaru engine?


I don't think that fuel economy would be adversly affected, especially if
you geared higher.  Not much reason to run a 3.3l 6cyl at 4,000 rpm at 70
mph.

&gt; &gt;engine and replacement parts.  Not to mention, the strain on the drive 
&gt; &gt;train, you will also need a brake system upgrade to stop the
&gt; &gt;shoe box when you are doing 100+ with 7 people, while pulling the trailer
&gt; &gt;and the A/C blasting. Also subaru no longer produces the SUX?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Forget to mention fuel consumption?  Single digit MPG results are not funy.
&gt;  Better throw in a new, larger tank in that list of modifications.
