Subject: Norseman Awnings 

As requested, I am supplying information for Norseman Apollo awnings. 
Norseman make kits available for Type II's, Vanagon's, and EV's.  The 
kits for the Type II's, and Vanagon's require NO drilling into the 
bodywork.  You can see my awning on my web pages at 
www.bcit.bc_dot_ca/~hyates.  I remove my awning for the winter, and 
reattach in spring with no marks on the bodywork.  I use small pieces 
of innertube between the brackets and paintwork, and this works out 
very well.  Our awning is 10' in length, and opens out about 8' (I 
think!).  I can have the sliding door opened all the way in the rain, 
and the van is totally dry inside as the awning covers about half of 
the front door as well.

For the EV, Norseman makes special brackets, BTW all brackets are 
aluminun.  These brackets are screwed into the bodywork of the van to 
permanently attach the awning.  Kind of a bummer :(  I saw a 
WESTFALIA awning on an EV Westy (CDN model) that looked great.  It 
was a European delivery vehicle and the owner purchased it in 
Germany.  I can't remember if it was permanently attached or not.  
The EV brackets from Norseman or black/anodized aluminum.

Here's the particulars;

Norseman Mfg.,
14545 - 115 Ave.,
Edmonton, Alberta
Canada  T5M 3B8

ph: 403-451-6939

This was purchased this in 1990, and we paid $455 CDN for the awning, 
$39 CDN for the bracket kit.  I'm not sure if the address or phone # 
is still current.  Maybe if any list members are  in Edmonton could verify 
and possibly supply a fax #, and current pricing,  that would be great.

Harry.
