Subject:      attention hot-water freaks: blue-light special on aisle fourteen
 ...

having nothing better to do yesterday, i picked up a copy of
4-Wheel Drive &amp; Sport Utility Magazine, october 1994. and in the back was
this ad:

UNLIMITED HOT WATER    CAMPING SHOWER
DON'T EVER GO TO BED DIRTY AGAIN!

All you need is any vehicle with a  water cooled engine (most are) &amp; a water
source (stream, lake, even a bucket) for UNLIMITED HOT SHOWERS all year long,
rain or shine.

* Fits most vehicles
* Easy installation
* Adjustable temp.
* Compact
* Great for use all year long!

send check or money order for $229.00 plus $10.00 shipping to
R&amp;M Specialty Products
P.O. Box 1683
Windsor, CA 95492

CA residents add 7-1/2 % sales tax.

(707) 838-3869 for information
---------------------------- end of ad -----------------------------------
the drawing shows a jeep-like vehicle with its hood open and a garden hose
running in two directions, one - to the creak, and two - to the shower head.
now, for $229 + $10 shipping, i'd better get some sort of pump and a whole
lot more than two lengths of garden hose!!! :)

anyway, maybe someone will be interested ... or live close enough to Windsor
to call and see what's up.

another ad shows a bunch of larger size fuel tanks available for all sorts of
off-road vehicles and vans (but no vw's listed). however it says &quot;If you don't
see your vehicle listed, call us. We have over 240 tank listings for different
vehicles.&quot;
800-783-4826     or (909) 737-7878  Corona, CA.

i'll call sometime next week and see what might be available. i wouldn't mind
an extra 4 gallons in my tank. :)
