Subject: Re: '64 Tranny Problems

&gt;On the good note, I coughed up the $120 to buy a Gene Berg shifter for my old
&gt;bus and it is an impressive piece of work, although it looks like I'll need to
&gt;open up the hole in my floor mat to clear the base of the assembly (this thing
&gt;has a shorter throw because the tall base raises the pivot point of the shifter
&gt;about 2 inches).  

If you got the locking shifter, and I hope you didn't, you will have to keep
your emergency brake in top adjustment because it hits the body of the
shifter, a serious design flaw, and the one thing Ol Geno should simply stop
selling.

Sincerely, 
Eugene
