&gt;I think I may be on the verge of fulfilling a 10 yr. dream -
&gt;getting a VW camper.

&gt;Here's what I know about the bus so far:
&gt;
&gt;1974 Custom Safare (non-poptop camper)
&gt;
&gt;Now, details on me, the potential buyer:

You must have never SEEN one of these... EE-You-gly! When you do, you won't
wonder why it's goin' cheap.

 (That little jab was for David Schwarze - our resident Safare Guru! Where
are you on this one Dave?)

Seriously, this is a unique, charming (in the classic VW way) and highly
useful vehicle (especially if you NEED a mobile squash court). I hear
Pavarotti warms up in one. Which marks the first time anyone has ever BEEN
warm in a VW.  Careful about relocating to other parts of the world though,
as this vehicle is taxed as a highrise in Japan and Tailand.

:) Friday yet in Japan and Tailand?

Jim
