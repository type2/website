t?
&gt;
&gt;Wolfsburg west is s'posededly reproing them. Never actually seen one,
&gt;so I can't comment on the quality...
&gt;

fwiw i have heard that the repro's don't have the correct &quot;waffle pattern&quot;
underneath the mat like the oem one's do, you might wanna ask WW. the mats
ain't cheap. i seem to recall rusty van bondo parted with a rather princely
sum for a nos one? care to comment mr. rvb??
