Subject: tiny push button on emergency brake bracket

I was wondering if anyone was familiar with this addition?

I have just acquired my first '76 Deluxe Camper.

On the emergency brake bracket - the triangular piece that holds the brake
lever to the dashboard - there is s very small little push button attached to
a wire which gets lost somewhere under the dash. When I push it nothing seems
to happen. Any ideas what it is?

Also mysterious to me is in the dash, just under the glove compartment, is
a plug which looks like a stereo input jack - the big kind - except it's not.
1/2 inch silver rim. Also connected to some wires which get lost in the tangle.
Any ideas on this one?

Just curious as I get use to what everything is for.
