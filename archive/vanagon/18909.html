You say
&gt;Anyway, I managed to get an estimate from a dealer today without &gt;having to
&gt;take the engine apart. It is $2071.34 including replacement of both &gt;heads.
&gt;I don't really like to pay this much to fix it. I'll probably exchange
&gt;the westy's engine with the 84 vanagon and keep the vanagon for occasional
&gt;use or sell it or use the rest of it as parts source for the westy.

&gt;Thanks much for those who responded to help. Very much appreciated.

David,
Have you considered doing the work yourself? Cost of new heads at the parts
place I use in Mountain View is $360 each and the gasket sets are $90 each.
that puts it at about $1000 including tax. Add a little more for the the
official sealant stuff and you're at about 1/2 the shop price. I just did this
on one head of an '85 and it's not really that bad of a job. I'd be happy to
provide assistance, tools, or moral support. I think you are in the bay area,
right?#005#
    If you decide to change engines and sell the van let me know. I might be
interested.
