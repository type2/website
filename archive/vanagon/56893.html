Subject: Long range fuel tank for vanagon?

Evening all,

Does anyone know of a source of larger-than-standard fuel tanks 
suitable for mating to an '86 vanagon?  The 'Tierra del Fuego 
Modification Plan' is bubbling up!

I think I saw a mailing relating to South African tanks being larger 
than the 60L norm a while ago, but may be mistaken.

Anyone done this?

Ta for any input,

Rich,
'86 Westy
