Once you here the noises it is time to save your money.  The longer you, the 
more it will cost.  Early on you may just need a pinion bearing.  Keep driving 
that way and you will need the ring and pinion set.  Ouch!.

 hearing these noises until the trans self-destructs?
 
 It doesn't seem likely that changing the trans oil, even to a heavier 
 weight, would much improve things.  Anybody have any contrary opinions? &gt;&gt;

Check the archives for info about &quot;Redline&quot; fluid, seems to be a big help. I
have also seen VAST improvement by adding Slick 50 Manual Trans fluid
additive.
