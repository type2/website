Subject: San Antonio, Texas show THIS WEEKEND

All,

For those who may be interested, as the subject indicates there is a
show in SA (San Antonio for the uninitiated) Joe Petty, his son, and
Jason Rehm (from the VintagVW list), as well as myself, are planning on
a caravan down to the show.  We will meeting at McDonalds on the north
side of San Marcos, along IH35 about 7:30 - 8:00am I will be leaving my
house on the far north side of Austin between 6:00 and 6:30am on sunday
8) in order to get to the McD's at the appointed time, if there is any
one on this list who is interested in joining the gathering, and
annoying the drivers on the Texas Autobahn, contact me to arrange a
meeting place, or for more instructions on where IH35 is ;-).

Regards,

David

PS I will be driving my Thing, and the others will be driving their
respective VWs.
