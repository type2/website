Good idea to use a new thermostat.  As a general rule, I always replace the
thermostat when I do head or other major engine work that could affect the
engine temp.  If your engine has been run hot since your new thermostat has
been replaced, I would replace it again.  Your engine doesn't have to
overheat to destroy the thermostat, just get hot.

Did you remember to bleed the coolant system?  The proceedure is in Bentley.
