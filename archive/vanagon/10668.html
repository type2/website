Yes, Ralf, VW engine r&amp;r is a one-person job if need be.  I've never had (or
needed) anything more than incidental hold-the-light-this-way-for-a-minute
spousal assistance.  Most of Muir assumes one motivated individual, so that's
a good starting point.  Can't remember whether your van has the removable
rear crossbrace.  If so, you don't even have to worry about getting the van
up in the air.
Good luck.
B.
