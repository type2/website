Subject:      Re: Grease seal on '84

Bearings I might consider keeping for spares, if they are in good
condition (but then, why replace them :).  Seals are not worth trying to
reuse, I would just get new ones and keep them on hand.

BTW, when you replace the wheel bearings, be sure to replace the races
also.

&gt; Does anyone have a good technique for removing a grease seal on the front

&gt; like to use my old bearings and seals as emergency spares if I can salvage
&gt; them.  Or am I just being cheap....
