Subject: Vancouver VW Show

So did Martha and Tobin make it to the show or did the rain scare you away?

Lief tied for 2nd place in the late bus category ( note that 1st place got 
ALL the votes -- maybe I should have voted for myself ;-) ).

Checked all parked VW's around the area and didn't see and vanagon_at_lenti 
stickers so....
