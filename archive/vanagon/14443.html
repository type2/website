Subject: backfire!

What causes are there for backfiring (mine's starting to do it on the 
down shift).  I know incorrect timing can cause this - why exactly?  Is there
residual compressed gas in the cylinder during exhaust stroke followed with
late ignition?  What other causes can lead to backfiring other than the 
timing disorder?  Muir doesn't say much about this phenon.
