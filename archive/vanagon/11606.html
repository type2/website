&gt; Ideally, a Bosch rebuilt starter but also need the 'little 
&gt; stuff' ie plugs, cap, rotor etc.

Try MOFOCO, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I got good prices on Bosch 
remanufactured starters and alternators there a few years ago.  Their 
phone is 800-558-8955, or 800-242-8968 for Wisconsin residents.
