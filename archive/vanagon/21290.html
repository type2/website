Subject: Re: to rebuild or not to rebuild



To All:

If your only criteria for an engine is cost they you should perhaps consider
the junk yard as your main source, but if your interest is in an engine that
will provide better than stock performance without any increase in
displacement, yet last longer than stock, then your only option is a custom
built engine.

The truth is, it would be rather difficult for the first-time rebuilder to
produce an engine that performed WORSE than stock.  The Volkswagen spec for
fit and balance is quite crude by modern standards.  When you rebuild your
engine yourself you have time on your side.  Spending the time to achieve a
more uniform fit pays long-term dividends in the form of better efficiency
and longer service life.

If you are considering replacing your engine it may be wise to review the
available literature.  Anyone even moderately handy with tools is capable of
rebuilding a Volkswagen engine.
