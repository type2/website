You should really check out those&quot; look alike&quot; &quot;MERCEDES WHEELS&quot; prior to
selling them or buying them as you are attempting to do, They are not as solid, nor as sturdy, nor do they resemble the FACTORY VW ALLOY WHEEL BUILT FOR THE VANS,the lug nuts are not safely mountable as they do not fit
the concave of the rim, and if you do still attempt to use these wheels
on your vans, make sure you get a lug wrench or tool that will fit the nut on the wheel in the event  you have to change a wheel, also when you
have 15&quot;tires mounted on 15&quot;wheels you need to consider the shortening
of the turning radius and the bottoming out onto the larger tire and
wheel,because unless you raise the front and rear you have certainly
lost circumference room and risk citting into the tire causing a
blowout,I speak from experience and of course this is OMHO, 
                                                                         
     Good Luck, Roy

&gt;You asked:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know which alloy wheels by other manufacturers work on
&gt;&gt; vanagons.  I have seen pictures of vanagons with Audi rims: which 
&gt;ones
&gt;&gt; are these?  The vanagon alloys are difficult to obtain at a 
&gt;reasonable
&gt;&gt; price.  Many thanks

&gt;Go to the Tirerack and check out the Borbet Replica II wheels:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.tirerack_dot_com/wheels/borbet/bo_rep2.htm
&gt;
&gt;These &quot;Mercedes only&quot; wheels are supposed to be a direct match for the 
&gt;Westy.

&gt;Has told me that he has installed these wheels on a Vanagon and that 
&gt;they are
&gt;strong and look great. I am considering them for my '91 Westy. 
&gt;
&gt;They take a &quot;low profile&quot; tire, 205/65 R15 which is supposed to result 
&gt;in an
&gt;overall gain of .2 inches in total wheel/tire diameter. This 
&gt;supposedly 
&gt;provides an accurate Odometer reading.
&gt;
&gt;Kyle recommends a reinforced tire on these. I am having a little 
&gt;trouble 
&gt;getting the straight scoop on appropriate tires.
&gt;
&gt;Michelin MXV Energy tires is what Tirerack recommended. These are a 94 
&gt;H rated
&gt;tire. That's 1477 lbs/wheel at 130 mph. They are a max 44 psi rated 
&gt;tire.
&gt;
&gt;This is a summation of what I have found over the past 2 weeks.
