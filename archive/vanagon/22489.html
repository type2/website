Subject: Re: Hitch survey for '68 - '71 bus

&gt;
&gt;May as well jump on this bandwagon, since I need a hitch for
&gt;my '71 bus.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know of a kit for such a hitch for a 68-71 era bus?
&gt;Class 1 is fine, and if I can bolt it on myslf, that's even
&gt;better, tho not mandatory.
&gt;
&gt;I've seen some (really old) that reach forward (FIF) under the
&gt;engine and bolt to something way up in there; and I've seen
&gt;some that just bolt to the two rear bumper brackets.
&gt;
&gt;Either type is fine...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance!

My father had one made for his early '60s Bus.  I still have it somewhere 
around the side of the house.  It's heavy as hell and reaches way back 
somewhere to be bolted on.  I remember towing a small pop-up camper trailer 
with it to and from Bif Bend in about '65 or so.  The main 3&quot; x 5/8&quot; part 
of it covered up the drain plug, though, as I recall.  Oil leaked all 
over it when doing an oil change.
