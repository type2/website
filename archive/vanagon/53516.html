&gt; Subject:       clutch master cylinder

&gt; '82 diesel Westfalia
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1.  My clutch master cylinder is leaking internally.  There is a small
&gt; amount of corrosion about half way down the bore.  When I push
&gt; the clutch, the transmission engages slowly as the master cylinder loses
&gt; pressure.  I think it is caused by the master cylinder.  I took the clutch
&gt; slave cylinder and it looked fine with no external leaking.  Has every bodies
&gt; experience been that it is usually the master cylinder??
&gt; Can these be rebuilt??  Whom do you think has the best price for a new one??
&gt; 2.  How do I drain the oil from the transmission??  I see a plug right by
&gt; the shift linkage but I don't know if this is the drain.  There is a plastic
&gt; cap on the top of the transmission.  I need a clue.  
&gt; 
&gt; 

1.  Rebuild kits Beck Arnley World Parts 071-7491 (maybe?) about $20, 
new cylinder Kyle at VW Motorsports (on list) about $60.  You make 
choice rebuild is possible but upper seal cup is a tricky install and 
very tight when you put her in (use a sleeve of mylar around piston 
past edge of cylinder) Rebuild kit is 2 cups 1 boot sort of a rip for 
$20 and sucess rate about 50/50.

2. That is fill plug, drain back near bellhousing at extreme rear 
bottom center of tranny.
