Subject: Auxiliary Heater (fwd)

Err... if you have hot water you could run it through an air conditioning coil,
but air conditioning coils really weren't designed for such use. They have
smaller coils than a typical heater core, since evaporating Freon absorbs
huge amounts of heat in order to change state, while water in a heating system
is simply radiating heat that it's already carrying. 

In addition, the way evaporators work is that there is a restriction
before the inlet, then the Freon goes through that restriction into
the relatively low-pressure wide-open spaces of the evaporator coil
and, well, evaporates, absorbing heat. You'd need to bypass that
restriction. I haven't the foggiest notion how it's done on typical
auto air conditioners, but if you look at the back of a typical
(defrost-type) freezer, you'll see the restriction -- a coil of very
tiny tubing that connects to the much larger evaporator tubing
inside the freezer.

I'm not familiar enough with the design of Volkswagon evaporator units to
speculate on the feasibility of good results, but I suspect not. Even
if you bypass the restrictor, the evaporator coil isn't really designed
for water, and probably won't give off enough heat to be truly useful in
Minnesota winters.
