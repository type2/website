So martha rubin says:
&gt; I was talking with David Schwarze this morning on IRC, and we both
&gt; thought it might be kind of fun to have a fall or even winter
&gt; gathering of west coasters from the list (anyone else who wants
&gt; to make the trip, welcome, too, of course!).  We both liked the
&gt; idea of Yosemite but agreed it would probably be too crowded,
&gt; even given the time of year, and David suggested Sequoyah, south
&gt; of Yosemite.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking of something like maybe a weekend, Friday evening
&gt; through Sunday afternoon in a campground in Novemeber, December,
&gt; or January. 
&gt; 
&gt; Would any of you be interested?
&gt; 

Well, if I don't go, the East Coasters and Canadians will never
let me hear the end of it.  So long as it's not too far away, I'll
be there.  Brrrrrr!!  Anyway.  :P
