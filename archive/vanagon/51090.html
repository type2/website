Good evening all....

If your one of theose folks who have been dying to convert your Vanagon to 
a Vanaru (Vanagon with a Subaru engine), have I got a deal for you.

Financial hardship has struck and I must abandon this project.  I have a 
unused (not driven with) KEP adapter kit #5500.  The kit includes a 
mounting plate that replaces the stock Subaru bell housing and a custom 
flywheel that mounts a standard 9&quot; van clutch and bolts to the Subaru 
crank.  It includes all mounting hardware for these two pieces.  This will 
work for the following engines:

Subaru 1.8 OHV (Late model GL/DL)
Subaru 1.8 OHC (Loyale)
Subaru 2.7 Opposed 6 (XT-6)

Any one of these engines fit nicely in the VW engine compartment.  Some lid 
mod is required otherwise you'll loose about 3 inches of ground clearance.

I paid $510 for this NEW in August.  I will entertain all reasonable 
offers.

I even have the wiring harness and the exhaust system set up for the OHV 
engine.  I'll throw these in for free, if you want them.  Additionally, I 
can provide you with some of the details on how to do the conversion

Personally, if you can find it, go for the 2.7.  It gives you 145hp.  Image 
those hills!
