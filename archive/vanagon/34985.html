&gt;What type of stop leak do you suggest and can I perform a &quot;leakdown&quot; test my
&gt;self or do I need to take it to a shop?

Leakdown test can be done yourself with an air compressor.  I can expalin
procedure if needed.  Large leaks require liquid sealer such as Bars Leak.
 Smaller leaks best selaed with powdered sealers.
