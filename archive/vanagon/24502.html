Subject: Re: Oregon Bashing

To All, but especially to the several Oregonians who took exception to my
comments about their State:

In transiting Oregon on a federally funded highway, Ididn't glue a chip to my
shoulder on crossing the state-line and was unprepared for the denigrating
comments about Californians overheard at rest stops.  I suppose there are
red-neck oafs at many gas stations in every state but Oafis oregoni made that
extra effort that justified special treatment and mention.  Perhaps the
impoliteness and ill-mannered behavior has something to do with the trees.
 Most of my prior visits to Oregon were in the more arid two-thirds of the
state east of the Cascades.  If given a choice, I'll avoid your state in the
future.

The State flag of California reflects the short-lived Bear Flag Republic.
 Perhaps you've confused it with the Portland People's Republic.  :-)
