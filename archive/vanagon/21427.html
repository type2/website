Subject: Re: EV Docs on theweb

It's a sad day when the law, moral conviction and propriety   are allowed
to determine a course of action :)  ;)  ;)   Where would we be if the
Trickster had allowed these petty concerns to set the course of his
presidency????  Dear god, what would have happened had our own Ted Kennedy
allowed mere decency  interfere with his Vineyard escapades on that fateful
night long ago???

Seriously, you're right of course.  I still think the service
docs/bulletins on the web would be useful.  A  recent (Boston) Globe
article on the new VWoA  add agency seemed to imply that a VWoA web site is
in the offing.  Do you think &quot;lobbying&quot; by bus list/alt.rec.vw types might
be able to get a service doc ftp site?

Best Regards, Moe
