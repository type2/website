dave:

all i can say is, you must have one hell of a big driveway, and potentially
a very understanding SO!! If you need a place to store a few over the
winter, my driveway always has space for one more air cooled VW :):):):&gt;

These wee beasties do become habit forming don't they! And BTW, YOU CAN
NEVER HAVE ENOUGH SPARE PARTS!!!, contrary to what some SO's might say ;p
:)

ok all you type II freaks...
&gt;
&gt;I am going to be traveling to Columbia, SC on Monday January 16 to
&gt;follow up on a barndoor bus lead and I was wondering if anyone
&gt;could point me toward any junk yards in the area where I could
&gt;pick up spare parts for my ever growing fleet.  (My goal is to have
&gt;a different DRIVEABLE vw for each day of the week!)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.
&gt;
