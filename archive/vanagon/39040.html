&gt; Garcia of the dead has nothing to do with VWs.

False

&gt; He was, however,
&gt; responsible for hooking thousands of people on drugs and cultivating a
&gt; lifstyle that glorified substance abuse.

False

&gt; It is poetic justice that he died
&gt; of heart problems stemming from his years of drug use.

False

&gt; That many of his
&gt; followers drove busses in imitation of the Hippie years is no reason to
&gt; associate him with this list.

True

&gt; I would  be offended if the stickers
&gt; &quot;honored&quot; this guy.

Opinion, neither true nor false

&gt; Lets have stickers which have to do with us and our
&gt; love of these vehichles.
&gt; 

True

conclusion is valid, albeit supported by few facts
