Subject: wheel&amp;bumper colors

Mike White and Glen Swanson were asking about wheel and bumper colors:

To the best of my knowledge the color for the wheels and bumpers were  L82
&quot;Silver White.&quot; It is more of a pure/bright/bluish white than the pearl
white or the gull gray white as used on the two-toned bodies. The L82 was
used on the poptop sections of the '65-'67 campers as well.

The &quot;white&quot; of the top half of the bus bodies varied by the combo with other
colors.  I used L87 &quot;Pearl White&quot; with the L512 &quot;Velet Green&quot; on the camper.
I believe that there is a &quot;Gull Gray White&quot; that was used with the Seafoam
Blue but have to stand down as I have no experience past this point.
Good luck!
