Subject: RE: engine seal/tin holes

I've never been clear about what level of paranoia is appropriate on this
issue (hermetically sealing engine cooling intake from engine cooling out-
flow).  I have one new data-point for you, altho it's not pure VW.

I've seen two other Porsche-powered Vanagons close up.  One was one of the
factory jobs, with the grey cloth executive express interior that was men-
tioned on the list a week or so ago.  The other was a homebrew like mine,
but more ... casual.  The engine in that car had no engine seal whatsonot-
any.  No sheetmetal front, sides or rear; look around the engine and see
ground, transmission, muffler.  It had been in that condition for thousands
of miles without a problem.

So I haven't gotten too excited about the corners where I was not able to get
the engine seal perfect.  We'll probably never know conclusively, because
it's a lot easier and cheaper to replace the seal than to run a scientific
test in controlled conditions.  Check out your spark plug seals, also, so
you don't &quot;waste&quot; the cooling fan's efforts.
