On my bookshelf I have one one end of a stack of books a &quot;modified&quot;
36 hp piston/cylinder ...you know the 36 hp engine that came out
in '59 and looked like a cross between a 36 and 40 hp engine..
well the pistons only fit that engine...

on the other side of a stack is a 40 hp piston/cylinder with the
head of the piston ripped off. Thats what you get when you are
young and foolish and doin' donuts in the beach parking lot...
and the oil doesn't get to one of the cylinders...&lt;sigh&gt;

In the less politically correct days I used the top of the
piston as an ashtray!
