Subject: toy bus, disconnecting shift linkage for engine swap

	Gregor writes:

  just getting mentally set for that engine swap from the 73 bus to the 74
and vice versa...do i need to disconnect the gearshift lever when i take out
the engine ??? i suppose for taking out the engine i'll have to lower the
rear end of the tranny somewhat, and that might bend the gearshift thingy if
i don't remove it. any opinions ??? and do i disconnect it right at the
tranny or where ???


	IMHO, pull the engine and tranny as a unit- You have to undo the
shifter and the axles, but you *DON'T* have to try to bolt engine and
trany together in the compartment. Plus the install is dead easy-
line it up, jack straight up. bolt in. No clutch/crankshaft alignment
baloney sauce.
	For the engine installation in my bus, we pulled the tranny out
and installed it on the engine, and will install them as a pair.

	Just my $0.02.


	My local hobby shop (D&amp;J Hobbies, Campbell, CA) has
a big (1:18?) Solido split-window bus toy! I didn't check the price
cos I can't buy it yet! Really pretty, white over red, natch.
