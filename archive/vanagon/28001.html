Subject: time for Changing plugs/ wires ???
Date: Fri, 03 Nov 95 10:37:08 EST
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

Just curious as to what the collective wisdom was as to the mileage
interval suggested between changing the plug wires, as well as the spark
plugs themselves. I have been told several different intervals by
various reliable sources. Anyway, any thoughts????
