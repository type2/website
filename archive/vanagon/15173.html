Subject: Re: California Emissions...

&gt;Amen to the gripes about smog checks.
&gt;
&gt;Why Mexico City has jumped so far ahead of California in the air pollution
&gt;race - because of all these hair brained smog checks and pollution control
&gt;garbage they make you use - that unless emergecy measures are enacted,
&gt;you'll never catch back up.
&gt;
&gt;:-(

What *are* you talking about?  That we're in a race with Mexico to see who
can produce the most polution?

Ron, hoping he's confused.
