&gt;   i think Jim Davis offers me the best hope because he seems to know what
&gt;  i am talking about and his cure makes sense....i'm going to replcae the
&gt;  tires and change the differential fluid to slippery synthetic.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Although it might turn out to be good advice, it wasn't mine.  I don't want
&gt; to take the credit from whomever it is due.

&gt; Good luck,
