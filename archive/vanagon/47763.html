    MY responce is simple...RIght now my GEX engine has about
    12,000 miles on it.  Right now it runs and sounds find!
    But after a very close look at the engine, (I did not buy it)
    there are many things, like a stripped drain plug that makes
    me wander............................

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; After following the threads on the 2 lists, there are a couple of items that
&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to clarify...
&gt; 
&gt; Implies that Mr. Dawson monitors the list. I pulled down the roster,
&gt; current as of tonight, and there is no herbie_at_mail.westworld_dot_com. There is
&gt; nobody at westworld_dot_com at all. It's possible that Mr. Dawson &quot;monitors&quot;
&gt; the list from another address, but if he does, why is this the first we've
&gt; heard of it? This is certainly not the first GEX problem to go public.
&gt; Joel, do you have him over there?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; In the last 4 or 5 months since I've been following the lists there have
&gt; &gt;&gt; been about 3 or 4 problems that people have had with GEX products and I have
&gt; &gt;&gt; resolved each one.    In that amount of time GEX has sold over 1500 engines
&gt; &gt;&gt; and 3000 heads.   Where are these people ??
&gt; 
&gt; Fallacious. Let's assume that &quot;3 or 4 problems&quot; with GEX engines is truly
&gt; the total noted on the lists(s) over the past five months. This is a sample
&gt; of people on the lists, who bought engines from GEX, who had problems, who
&gt; posted to the lists about it. This is a far, far smaller pool than the set
&gt; {total number of people who bought engines from GEX and do not subscribe to
&gt; the lists}.
&gt; 
&gt; Dawson is implying, through subterfuge, that there have only been three or
&gt; four problems among 1500 engines he's sold. I doubt this very much.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; One further observation that I would like to make...   I think I read
&gt; &gt;&gt; somewhere that a dissatisfied customer tells 7 people about his experience
&gt; &gt;&gt; and a satisified customer tells nobody because he received what he expected.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This number must be multiplied by a factor of 100 (or more) on the internet.
&gt; 
&gt; Incorrect. Multiplied 360-fold (last Friday's count) on this list alone,
&gt; probably a like number on v_at_l, plus people who read from the web page. All
&gt; of whose engines are going to die eventually and will need replacement.
&gt; Which makes tap-dancing a very unwise business decision.
&gt; 
&gt; If Dawson monitors the list, why did David Carment have to *forward*
&gt; Dawson's message? If GEX engines have no problems except the occasional
&gt; abberation, why are they continually slammed on this list and v_at_l? If GEX's
&gt; warranty is worth anything, why did Carment have to mention that there were
&gt; hundreds of people watching in order to have his problem solved?
&gt; 
&gt; If the number of bad GEX engines is so small that it is insignificant, why
&gt; is the CEO of the company occupied with damage control?
&gt; 
&gt; I will admit here that I am angry, I may be missing something. If I am,
&gt; somebody please correct me and I will gladly admit it in public. This is
&gt; CCed to GEX, and reprisals from responsible spokespersons are always
&gt; welcome. ;)
