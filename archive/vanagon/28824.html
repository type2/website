Am I missing something?


Yes.

The spark voltage is generated as the points open.  That is why the 
slightly different lobe on the distributor shaft changes the timing for 
that cylinder.  The position of the rotor is not critical and doesn't 
affect timing.  It just needs to be near enough to the proper distributor 
terminal to arc over.
