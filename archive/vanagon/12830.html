Well, after a week fighting with the net gods, sunnet.chotel_dot_com
has mail service again. I missed all you guys/gals/inanimate
objects.

I learned over the weekend that you can't get around that oval
hole that the clevis pin on the clutch cable goes into by 
reversing the little lever so the clevis pulls on the 
round part instead of the oval. The clutch cable tightens 
just fine, but doesn't seem to move enough to disengage
the cable.

So what's going on?
