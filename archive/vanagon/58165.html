Subject: Recommended oil wt for CA summers, '87

Hi all,

Have been considering synthetic oil for my supposedly rebuilt engine [now at
117k, supposedly rebuilt 9/96 but no records or info of any kind provided,
tho a mechanic did confirm at prepurchase inspection that it had been
rebuilt], but have hesitated till I see what oil consumption experience
is---so far, 1 qt in the 2300 miles I've driven since purchase in 1/97.

So, am unsure what to put in it at oil change, looking fwd to summer of
daily driving in the hot Sacramento Valley, with numerous overnite trips of
200+ miles planned.

Also, friends have been satisfied w/the carefulness of work done at a
particular local JiffyLube on different vehicles, foreign and domestic, but
I've seen skepticism on this list.

Suggestions/recommendations, please, wrt:

        weight of oil to use

        synthetic vs fossil?

        &quot;ordinary&quot; facilities, if conscientious?

Thanks for any ideas.

Gail
