&gt;I wouldn't be so pinheaded to decide a product's worth by the person
&gt;standing next to it in the ad.


Come on, guys! You know that's not why the swimsuiters are in the ads.
It's merely to catch your eye, so that you will then say, &quot;Hmmm, as long
as I've stopped at this page, let's check out these parts and prices...&quot;.
It's not to modify your judgement (does anyone out there even think this
is *possible*?)-- it's just to get you to stop flipping the page at that
point. For most men (including moi), it usually works.

'Course, I always DO wonder just a little, if the lady will personally
deliver the seat covers I'm ordering-- she only has to take time once
a month for the photo, and is free for other duties the rest of the time!
