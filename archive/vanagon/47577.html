Subject: Re: '83 H2O head gasket advice needed (long)

Hi Tony,

&gt;you. Do you know the heading? I'm planning to start the job late next 

I still have my copy, but on a PC not netted (it's at the cottage for 
summer) I posted it with a title that requested others to review the article 
and add comments.  Sorry, I'm a sieve, I admit it.  If you got Dan Hougs 
JBWeld/heads article you have what you need anyhow.  When you retorque you 
should probably pickup a tube of Locktit-Permatex hi-temp silicone goop 
(orangish colour) and take off each nutm apply a smear to threads and face 
of nut, then retighten.  This is the way you put it together when doing the 
gaskets, but I don't know if it matters for the retorqueing, haven't seen a 
firm opinion either way. Good luck.   tim
