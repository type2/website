Subject: Re: Any electricians?

&gt;I have a VW related question for you all.  :)  The garage at my new 
&gt;place is perfect except for the lack of electricity.  I bought a big 
&gt;extension cord to run out there from the house.  So far all I plan to 
&gt;run off the thing are lamps.  All of the power tools I have right now 
&gt;are cordless.  So, before I go burn the place to the ground:  Can 
&gt;somebody tell me how many 100 watt bulbs I can plug into this cord?  
&gt;It says &quot;Use this medium capacity outdoor cord with garden or power 
&gt;tools and appliances that require 10 amps or less.&quot;  It also says 16 
&gt;AWG on there and down by the little UL sign it says 10A 1250W 16/3 
&gt;SJTW-A.  It is 100ft in length.  I recently consolidated my household 
&gt;with my SO so I have about as many lamps as I could want for plugging 
&gt;in out there.  Last night we pushed and turned the bus sideways in 
&gt;there so I have more room at the rear for getting the motor in and 
&gt;out.  All I need is to order a few more parts and get myself a little
&gt;work bench built.  Thanks for any help with the electricity thing.

Jim,

See if you can find the circuit breaker/fuse that is protecting this outlet.
Find it's rating, also find out what else, if anything, is plugged to this
circuit.  It is likely a 15 or 20 amp device.  If there is nothing else on
the circuit the 15 amp outlet is good for 1500 to 1750 watts, the 20 amp
outlet is good for 2000-2400 watts.  Subtract anything else plugged from
what your using from your extension cord.

16 gauge - 1000 watts / 10 amps

14 gauge - 1500 watts / 15 amps

12 gauge - 2000 watts / 20 amps

These are conservative ratings based on a low voltage ( &lt;110 ) and
continuous usage, real world use can be higher by about 10 %.

I'd use at least a 14 gauge cord for power tools that will run with lights
etc., you'll get less voltage drop and your skilsaw will be happier.  Your
fine with what you've got though, even with all those battery chargers lined
up.  Your cord speaks the truth.
