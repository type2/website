So JamesG1519_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; Is is possible to add Air Conditioning to a water cooled Westy after the
&gt; fact?

You could add one, but man!, what a hassle.  You'd have to remove the overhead
cabinet and side closet.  Install the evaporator (from another donor westy)
along with the hoses and electronics that comes with it.  What a nightmare!

I'd pass on the Westy you're looking at and keep shopping.  It's not worth
the trouble to have to retrofit an AC and all of its components.  IMO.
