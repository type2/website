Well, I am back from a 10,000 mile tour de America in my 73 Westy. Had a
few problems, of course they weren't the ones I was expecting. I'll tell
the tale and give the mileage and gas consumption soon.

The problem is I SAVED all my mail from the 5.5 weeks I was gone and
then promptly erased it. Bummer.

I need to find Chris Loggans to see if he's shipped my smog pump. If so,
it got lost in the mail. Or, perhaps, since I wasn't here to sign for it
it got returned???

Never once had to be towed. Did need a jump in Salt Lake City when my 3
month old battery (Exide, paid top dollar) failed. Replaced it and had
no other problems with electrical. Well, almost no others if you don't
count a temp guage that would, on occassion, suddenly shoot up aboutr 40
degrees and then drop back down....

Other problems, a nail (not a flat) and low tire in Wyoming. Exhaust
system came loose in New Hampshire. Bolted it back on in Texas.

Miles of smiles in the Westy, with my wife and kids ages 3-5-8-10. (Yes,
we took out the sink and bolted in an extra jump seat.

With kids that small, we were able to sleep two on top. Baby in the
hammock and one &quot;under&quot; the fold down bed.
