&gt;
&gt;I want to replace my cassette/radio  with a dash mounted CD player.
&gt;
&gt;Following Ajax' hints from a few weeks ago, I ordered a Crutchfield catalog
&gt;as basic reference material. After drooling for a while, I called the 800
&gt;number to find out what size reciever would fit in the Syncro Westie. The
sales rep &gt;said I could not exceed 6 1/4 inches in depth. That pretty much
excluded 95% of the &gt;head units they had listed, including ALL the dash
mounted CD players.
&gt;
&gt;Who has been down this road before?  Is the 6 1/4&quot; restriction for real?

I think that 6.25&quot; sounds a little short.  I've put several stereos in my
Vanagons and never worried or measured the stereo depth - they just fit.
 This deph should be easy enough for you to measure by poping out the ash
tray in the top of the dash.  

If I were you I'd consider a remote CD changer.  I've installed these in both
my Vanagons and love them.  I've mounted them under the passenger seat to
provide easy access from either the driver's seat (while stopped) or the
passenger's seat.  It's a pretty simple installation  -  you just need to cut
away a little section of sheet metal at the front end of the under seat
storage area to make a place for the face of the CD changer.
