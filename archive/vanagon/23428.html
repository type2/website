&gt; &gt; For propane, I've gotta 12V DC system that keeps the food plenty cool
&gt; &gt; so I'm going to use that instead of propane which would be in the lines
&gt; &gt; which kind of exposes it to possible danger.  Well, I don't want to
&gt; &gt; take the chance, how ever small, I'm going to stay on the safe side.
&gt; &gt; It's you ass, so if you smoke yours, don't come cryin' to me or a 
&gt; &gt; lawyer.  You've been well informed.
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't there going to be propane in the lines whether the fridge is
&gt; running on propane or 12V?

Well, yes, but if you leave the valve open and are running propane,
you end up with a nice fuse line to ignite the entire tank.  At
least, that is my impression.
