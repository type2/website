&gt; A local guy sells Westfalia pop top decals for a pretty reasonable price =
&gt; of $39.95 (front and back sticker) for standard colors (black, white, =
&gt; brown, red, silver) and $51.95 for custom colors (like reflective black, =
&gt; fluorescent colors, Zebra striped or tie died). =20
&gt;
&gt; The decals are great.  I have searched everywhere and they can not be =
&gt; found.  I have reflective vinyl on my '84 Westy and it is very cool - it =
&gt; glows at night like a street sign - this is helpful when trying to hike =
&gt; back to the camper at night.  I saw the Zebra stripe on a white Westy =
&gt; that was really hip - I am sure the tied died looks great on older =
&gt; buses. =20
&gt;
&gt; They are made from commercial vinyl and are guaranteed not to fade or =
&gt; un-adhere for five years.  His name is Dean and he is at =
&gt; elvis_at_unidial_dot_com or (303) 780-0483.=00=00
I have the artwork for the Westfalia stickers on electronic file.  I
will look it up and when I find it I will post it to the list.  You can
download the file to a floppy, take it to your local Insta-Sign,
Vinyl USA, etc and have them make the decals for you in any color you
would like, to include those colors noted in the previous listing.  They
charge me about $6.00 dollars each.
