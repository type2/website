The A/C systems are different . One difference is, our 85 has the
evaporator and fan positioned  just  behind the drivers head. After 85
they moved it to the back of the cabin. Again referencing the Bentley
manual; there are NO pressure switches on the 84,85 model. Looking on
page 97.140 for 1986-88 there are (pressure switches).
