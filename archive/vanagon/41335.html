Just heard from someone that i may not have a 65 campmobile at all - my documentation says different.

Could someone clairify this from the info below....

Metal tag on flow thru vents above/between front passengers on passenger side (held on with rivits): 

&gt;
VOLKSWAGENWERK AG
MADE IN GERMANY
Typ 21	Fahrgest - Nr. 215042091
Heizg. Typ 2/255 A Prutz ~~S45
Zul. Gesamtgew. kg. 2070 Baujahr
Zul. Achstast vorn kg. 950 hinten kg 1150
&gt;


Metal tag behind passenger seat on wall btwn front and back (held on with screws):

&gt;
12   0

425  002  025  116  523

UB  2112  131383  5042091 
&gt;



Silver sticker right below above tag:

&gt;
Perlweiss  L87 (the _ss_ is replacing the funny looking capitol B looking character on the tag)
&gt;


Any help would be greatly appreiciated.  I do not think this is a westy, but i don't know what it might be.
