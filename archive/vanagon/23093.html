It would be useful to know a) what to look for in order to anticipate the
problem; b) what kind of driving, engine temps, oil pressure etc that you and
your friend have and c) whether we should talk to GEX about this....
-------------------------------------------------------------
Like you, I am also an experienced amateur mechanic.   My friend was at one
time a professional mechanic.  He is now an engineer, like me.

a)   There was no warning in my case.   I don't know about my friend's.
b)   Most of my miles is on the freeways, as are my friend's bus.   I
     average about 60-65 mph while cruising.   Never had the oil pressure
     light come on and never had any problems with cooling on mine.   I  
     don't know what the engine temps. were.   The engine seal on mine was
     in good shape.   Oil (Castrol  10W-40, 20w-50 or 30w) was changed 
     every 3333 miles.   The oil filter was changed every 6666 miles.
     Mileage varied from 14 to 17 mpg.
c)  GEX probably already knows about this but I would be interested in
     what their response.    When I mentioned GEX to one major independent   
     VW parts place, they kind of hinted their rebuilt heads had problems.

Other than the head, the only other problem I've seen is that there was a
pinched O-ring for one of the pushrod tubes - it was improperly installed,
causing oil leakage when parked on a steep hill.      It runs fine now.
