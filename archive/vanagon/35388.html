Subject: Re: Something positive

&gt;Since I am a new list member myself I believe that a lot of new members
&gt;may get the idea that old VW busses (and new ones) are not that reliable.
&gt;Hearing everyone's problems can be somewhat discouraging.  So lets hear some
&gt;good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage busses
&gt;have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
&gt;one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt;without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
&gt;be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.

&gt;'77 Westy (about 3 weeks of trouble free driving)
&gt;'74 bus (never ran, parts bus)
&gt;'82 rabbit (at least a year of trouble free driving)
&gt;

 Wilma has asked for the regular items in 2.5 years. So, add her to the list
of no problems.
