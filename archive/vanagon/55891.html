Subject: Bugs galore... :)

Just had to tell someone:

While driving home today, I saw three 60's beetles (with the thin 
chrome bumpers) in really nice shape within 30 seconds. Two were side 
by side in front of me, and another crossed through the intersection. 
The one in front appeared to have original paint, and very little 
rust...

And it's not even spring yet...!
