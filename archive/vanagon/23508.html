&gt; Answer to question 1.
&gt; Always buy parts that are designed for the year and model vehicle that 
&gt; you are putting them in. This is espicially true for aftermarket parts, 
&gt; but holds true for OEM parts as well. There are some parts for 
&gt; different year vehicles that will work but unless your parts dealer is 
&gt; well versed in which parts fall into this category play it safe and buy 
&gt; parts for the vehicle make and model year.

FWIW I have a coil for an 82 that is made in *Slovakia*  (not OEM -
obviously) that
came from Scherba's ...seems to do the job just fine.... at half the price...
