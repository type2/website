	Hey I have a tent that fit onto my '72 California Conversion.
	It attaches above the sliding door, and is fully enclosed, with
	mesh windows and vinyl floor. 
	Anyone  know of it's value?

&gt; I have a 1970 Westphalia bus that my neighbor
&gt; wants to give me $3000.00 for.  It is all original,
&gt; I'm the 2nd owner, and I guess that $3000.00 is
&gt; a fair price for the vehicle.  He also wants the
&gt; tent that I have, that matches the bus.  My
&gt; question is, what is an original 1970 orange canvas
&gt; tent worth?  It is in very good to new condition.
&gt; 
&gt; Please e-mail me at dunne_at_tellabs_dot_com with any
&gt; opinions.  Thanks.
