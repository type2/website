&gt;&gt;&gt;which I have any familiarity are Cumins, which have a very low oil
&gt;&gt;&gt;consumption and regularly achieve service lives of half a million miles or
&gt;&gt;&gt;more.

&gt;&gt;        Ok, who's gonna run out and put a Cummins in their bus? Steve?
&gt;&gt;Anyone??
&gt;
&gt;Size-wise, I believe a bus fits better inside a Cummins Diesel.  :^)

Cummins have some pretty cool web pages. Check:

        http://www.cummins_dot_com/chome.html

They have some RV/camping info (Trip of the week/month or someting
like that). Right now it's about Washington DC (The advice: park
your camper outside and take the metro in). Of course they also have
some engine pictures and data to drool over. For those considering
the swap ;-) check out their &quot;small&quot; and &quot;lightweight&quot; B5.9 engine!

CUMMINS B5.9 RATINGS. 

                   Advertised                        Governed
  Engine Model     Horsepower      Torque _at_ Rpm       Speed
  ____________________________________________________________
   
  B5.9-230            230            605 _at_ 1600     1600-2500 

  B5.9-210            210            520 _at_ 1600     1600-2500 

  B5.9-210            210            485 _at_ 1600     1600-2500 

  B5.9-190            190            475 _at_ 1600     1600-2500 

(Just for comparison the VW 1.9 TDI diesel produces 90bhp_at_4000rpm
and the 149lb-ft of torque kicks in already at 1900rpm. The
standard late model 2.1 boxer has 95 HP _at_ 4800 rpm and 
117 ft-lb _at_ 3200 rpm I believe)
