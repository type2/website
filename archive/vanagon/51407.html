Subject: '83.5 distributor into '78

Has anyone installed an early wasserboxer (1.9) ignition into a 2 liter ac
motor.  I'd really love to get rid of the points on the Riviera ('77) and I
DO have an 83.5 parts van with the ignition system intact.  Is it a
&quot;drop-in?&quot;

On another subject: Thanks to all who responded about the Corvair parts.  I
have passed the info along to the prospective Corvair owner.

Jim Arnott
