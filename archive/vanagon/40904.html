Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

Just recieved some items from the BusBoys. When ordering I emphatically
requested the catalog. I mentioned that this was the fifth request. I flatly
&quot;ragged&quot; on the guy (Bill) about how lame they were in getting the catalogs
out. I suggested a minor marketing concept that if they shipped catalogs to
all of the folks that I knew never got them that they just might sell more
items. (duh!).
Did the catalog come with the order? NOPE!
BTW: The OEM style left latches that were recieved were poorly cast and may
be returned with a request for them to sort through the pile to find nicer
ones. I figure that if they can't handle a catalog after SIX requests then I
shouldn't count on getting nicer handles.
BB Part # for the latches were 211-847-515 NEATO discount= $31.96 ea.
