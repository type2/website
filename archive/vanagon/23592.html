Subject: oil changes and BarsLeaks

Dose anyone have any tips on changing the Vanagons oil? I'm
planning to change mine on Saturday. I've picked up a
FRAM oil filter, Quaker State 10W-40 oil and one of those
oil pan/recycling containers. I also have a 19mm socket.
In the Bently it says to replace the drain plug washer. 
Do people get the washer at the dealer or a FLAPS?

The previous oil change was done by a local auto repair
shop. Since that oil change, oil has been dripping from 
the drain plug. They said that the drain plug and washer 
were not &quot;standard&quot; and went to a FLAPS for a new plug/washer.
I wounder if they did something wrong.

On a side note, I added BarsLeaks to the coolant system
and Ta-Da no more coolant dripping from the engine. Which
makes the oil drip all the more noticeable.

Please respond directly since I'm on digest.

TIA,
