&gt; Does anyone on the list have an idea  what a 86 Vanagon GL with air, 5 speed
&gt; is worth?  92K Miles

&gt; 

I just bought an '84 Vanagon with 86K miles, air and 5 speed for $2300 from
an individual.  About 9 months ago I was looking at an '85 Vanagon GL with
86K miles, air and 5 speed on a dealer's lot that was priced a $4995.  They
sold it for $4700.  This was in Durham North Carolina.
