Subject: Part 3:87 Parted out!

Many of you sent me Requests for specific pieces, I've tried to 
personally e-mail those of you who did so.

  I'm letting the list know that there were a couple of very nice items 
not asked about!

  The Front seats are Perfect, Blue &amp; Grey, Adjustable arm rests, 
interested e-mail me.

  The folding rear seat with late-model type headrests, again Blue &amp; 
grey.

  This van had the Plastic paneling moulded for the table, it's Grey and 
in Perfect shape!??

  Only one person asked about the folding table?  I thought that 
everyone wanted this type of interior that didn't have a Camper?  I must 
be wrong!

  Last but definetly not least, I have the LEFT Jumpseat and all 
hardware, including the mounts for the floor!

  Also I have the Bracket, belts and mounts for the Right Jump seat, 
just not the seat itself.

  I was shocked that NOBODY asked for these seats!  I must get to in 
stall it in my Vanagon:)  Just kidding!

  Anybody interested e-mail me!:)
