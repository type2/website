&gt;I would pull over before it hits 250, as an absolute maximum.  Best to slow
&gt;down before it gets that hot, though.  I consider 230 a sign that I am
&gt;straining the engine.

I had a '71, (stock dual port 1600) it came with a dipstick oil temp guage,
this was the first vw I owned that I could tell the oil temps. This bus was
heavy! PO had built the inside into a camper, 1/2 plywood, looked good.
The guage was in C, and 110 C was the boiling point of oil, (I don't
remember where I read that, Idiot's Guide maybe). Anyway it always ran over
110, when I thru a rod I started thinking about the oil temps.
I bought a full flow oil cooler from REEVECO(?) in Berkeley, Ca, worked
good. Even pulling a full load of family up thru N. Ca (I-5) in the summer
it never went above 110C, and the bus was full. Never thru a rod again either.
If you are concerned about the oil temp, get a cooler or get rid of the temp
guage. A cooler is probably a better idea. 8-)
The End.
