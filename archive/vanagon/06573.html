A friend of mine just used this service and ended up buying
a vehicle from the list.  It sounds great.  I know they serv
So. Cal. and possibly the West  coast.  Could even be nation
wide.  I'm sure there must be others also.
The # is 1-800-CAR-SEARCH.  It's free to receive a listing and
$25.00 to place a add (until the car is sold).  You call them,
give the make(s), model(s), and year(s) of the car your looking
for and they FAX you a list of vehicles that match.

-Scott.
WESTY RENTAL STUFF
P.S. I can't remember the name of place so I'll drive by tonight
     and get the info for those who requested it.
