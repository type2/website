Hey Pete!  Margarita and I were just upstream from ya at BBTA!  I
realize people may forget names but how can ya forget the loudest
pants at the event!  BTW, what is the bimonthly pub by VW and how does one get
it?  ---stopping for toys eh?  A man after my own heart.  Of course...
SOMEONE at BBTA spent the rent money on toys... we don't need to mention the
guilty party by name do we JOEL!  Now that I have Joel's attention, to
comment (rather late) on your trip report, I did NOT dress in camoflage
gear for my nightime requisition of the picnic table from way up the hill.
I wore the patchwork guatemalan pants (mentioned previously here) which
were quite loud, AND a bright purple shirt with 2 large white skulls and
peace symbol emblazoned across the front.  Hardly stealth gear.  Also,
it took Margarita and I nearly 20-30 minutes to carry the table to the van.
We had help from some guy for about the last 100ft.  Somehow the
table seemed MUCH smaller in the dark.

Ahhh, the tuna bombers.  I started having flashbacks to when I was in the
infantry (kinda scares those of you who met me huh?  Hippie types with
guns...RUN!  Anyway, I think I had a few nights where I bolted upright from
sleep yelling &quot;INCOMING!&quot;  I'm feeling MUCH better now.  I love the smell of
tuna in the morning!


To all at BBTA, thanks for the company.  Pete--Eurovans don't handle well
in mud either--hahahahaha

Anyway, Southeastern people, how about something in the smokies or maybe
The Breaks (KY-VA Park)?  Maybe a short rally with a few stops ending
near cumberland falls in time for the moonbow?
