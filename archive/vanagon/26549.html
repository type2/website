Subject: Help! Info on towing a small trailer?

Help-
	I checked the archives for info on towing a small trailer with a bus,
and came up empty... Anyone know of any other places to check?
	Owner's manual was some help on the matter, btw. It states 
that it *can* be done, and gives max trailer weights (roughly 1,500 lbs 
without additional braking).
	I'm well aware that I won't be getting anywhere real quick with 
the added weight, but I've gotta do it -- I'm moving, and Uhaul rates for 
a moving truck, from Seattle to Buena Vista, Colorado, are in the $1,200 
range when gas is figured in.
	So, I want to buy a used 4'x 8' trailer and do it myself. Lotsa 
mountain passes aside, given enough time to take my time, it must be 
possible.
	Again, Help? Advice? Anyone who's towed a trailer with a bus
before?
Thank you very much in advance!
