Subject: Spring servicing...

Volks,

Well, I finally installed the new heads on my 1600 DP.  And new push 
rod tubes. (Their cheap.)  Calculated combustion ratio ~ 7.7 (alittle 
high, will baby it).  Pulled the old heads (guestimated milage~ 
20k).   Carbon deposited, #2 combustion chamber showing two  
cracks;   between spark plug and intake valve 
(through the seat!) and a crack between the intake and exhaust valve. 
The #1 chamber had alot of combustion by-product (brown-orange) 
around the exhaust valve.  I could hear this developing during the 
bowels of winter and I promised Foo I'd take care of it if we could 
make it 'till spring.  I kept my word.

With the engine out, I replaced the front transaxle mount (again).  I 
replace the shift-coupler with a real one. (I didn't like the repro 
from Rocky Mountain Motor Werks, I did like the one from MoFoCo.)  I 
also installed the plastic bushings for the shift rod.  I raised the 
front end.  I greased everything.  I repaired the spade connectors to 
the horn. (It is so much louder now.)  I adjusted the breaks.  I bled them too.  
I feel good.  Foo feels good. (and sounds oh-so sweet!)

Later,
