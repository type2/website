&gt;... in Florida, premium is like $1.25-$1.40 a
&gt;gallon!!!!!

&gt;&gt;Sorry just had to say something, I'd love to pay $1.40 a gal for gas, here
(Canada) our 87oct stuff is worth .69 cents a litre or about $2.80 for a US
gallon and about $3.40 for an Imperial gallon.
&gt;&gt; From what Ive heard the
prices in Europe are even higher.

	I work it out a bit higher here in Copenhagen, we pay about $1.42 CDN per
liter ($5.26 CDN per gallon) or $1.04 USA per liter ($3.85 USA per gallon).
Filling the bus runs about $42.00 USA a throw. (I'm calculating premium
leaded).
