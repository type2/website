&gt; 
&gt; To drop 12v to 6v with merely a resistor will require a specific
&gt; resistor based upon the amperage draw of the device (or entire
&gt; circuit) you intend to supply 6v for. One resistor can't apply to
&gt; all loads/circuits/devices!   the mathematics to calculate this
&gt; resistor value are simple but i can't remember them!!
&gt; 

The same as the resistance thru the wiper motor,  Six is half of twelve.
