Subject: Cracked glass and Vanagon at Devils Lake

Hey all
        The crack in my windshield is expanding at a scary rate.  I called
a few auto glass places and they can fix with a sort of cement I quess
(circa $60 bucks).  Anybody ever tried this?

Also -- Hello to the Syncro that was waving at me Tuesday on Highway 12.
Sorry I looked up to late.

Chris
