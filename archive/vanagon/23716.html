Subject:       Magnesium related. not VW!

Rumor had it that older Lawnboy mower decks were made out of 
magnesium... i think they currently use aluminum.  Does anyone have 
any experience or info on this...  of course strictly in the academic 
sense.  i'd never DO anything with my father-in-law's mower... not 
when he's around, anyway     :)
