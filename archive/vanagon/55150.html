My 13 years of Vanagon Westi ownership has been good.  But now that I 
have 3 kids, it's tough to go camping with all of them (seatbelted 
that is).  With this change I have been lurking on this 
discussion on the desireability of seating and camping.  My re-design 
ideas of the Westi interior may be of interest, but usually not.

A minimum for camping for us would be, pop-top, full width rear 
seat/bed, sink and stove.  Fridge is optional and can easily be 
replaced with a ice chest.  Don't need the storage cabinets on the 
side.  Use duffle bags, suitcases, packs etc.  That sink/stove combo 
is just too nice to give up, but it's too long to allow full width rear seat.

I would like to start with a 90/91 MultiVan layout.  Rear facing 
seats behind front, fold up table, LR cabiner, pop-top.
All I need is a place to put the sink/stove unit (could be self contained 
and removeable with propane and water tanks included?) Behind the 
passenger? and can be replaced with seat for 7th person? for 
non-camping.  Still need seats for 5 in the camping section, but 
still be nice to have 7 for non-camping.

I like having the rear left cabinet for tools and spares (it IS a VW 
remember).

Now if Vanagons had the dual opening doors from a Split, the 
sink/stove could be attached to the doors.  Where's that cutting 
torch?!

Any other bizarramundo ideas out there?

'80 Westi, and another one that may get transmogrified into the 
above.

&gt; &gt; What (if any) Eurovan and/or Vanagon comes with:
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  pop top
&gt; &gt;  fold down bed
&gt; &gt;  preferably front wheel drive
&gt; &gt;  2 rear facing seat --OR-- middle bench seat (Either way seats 7)
&gt; &gt;  full fridge
&gt; &gt;  stove and or sink
&gt; &gt;  tables for kids to color on/play board games etc.
&gt; &gt;  cup holders
&gt; &gt;  cabinets
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like you're looking for a motor home.  
&gt; Vanagons ('80-'91) and Eurovans('93+) typically come in either passenger
&gt; versions that seat 7 or Camper versions that seat 4-6.
&gt; No Vanagon or Eurovan was made that BOTH seats 7 AND has the
&gt; fridge/stove/sink/cabinets.
&gt; 
&gt; You'll need to choose either the full camping gear or the seating for 7.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1990 &amp; 1991 they offered the MultiVan model that was similar, offering the
&gt; pop-top,  fold down rear seat/bed, a fold up table and seating for 7, but no
&gt; refrigerator.
&gt; Neither of these models offers the stove/sink but do have a single rear
&gt; cabinet.
&gt; 
&gt; Some basic Wolfsberg Edition Vanagon campers included:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- Seating for 6
&gt; 	- Cabinets
&gt; 	- Fold down table
&gt; 	- Removable cooler (120AC/12DC)
&gt; 	- Cup holders
&gt; 
&gt; But no stove.
