Markus: I won't be able to make either date. I was in Saskatoon at a
meeting. ;) If you mean May 4 or 5 I can't make those dates either - email
me privately and we can arrange a date. David Carment

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt;   I've just been emailing with Frank Condelli and we were toying with
&gt; the idea of a Pizza Night for Ottawanians that are on these lists.
&gt; There appear to be a few of us!
&gt; 
&gt; Location:	To Be Determined (recommendations solicited)
&gt; 
&gt; Date:		Thurs. April 4th or Sat. April 6th (I prefer the Thurs)
&gt;                 Note:  we are pretty flexible on the dates so if these prove 
&gt; 		impossible for someone we can accomodate!
&gt; 
&gt; Time:		Guess that depends on children, date, etc
&gt; 		
&gt; Who:		Hey, if you've got a VW tie-in, welcome! (wannnabe's included)
&gt; 		SOs, husbands, wives, children, ...
&gt;                 (We aren't going to be a big crowd so the more the merrier:-) 
&gt; 		
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; At a minimum Frank and I will meet and eat pizza:-)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm digested so please drop me a line at this address.
&gt; 
&gt; c ya!
&gt;
