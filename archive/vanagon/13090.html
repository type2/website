&gt; hydraulic fluid available from the dealer, it says &quot;For all EXCEPT 
&gt; Vanagon&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody have info on this?  Found a product that works?  Why
&gt; NOT Vanagons??  I've got a 2.5 gallon jug of hydraulic fluid sitting

No Dan,

There are reasons for saying &quot;except vanagon&quot; The vanagon's hydraulic
system is very different than other cars.  Look at the overall size of it
for one. The fluid recommended for vanagons is the one to use. The pump,
actuators and even lines are all very dissimilar.
and the two fluids are not homogeneous so you can't get away with
mixin in a bit of the cheaper stuff.

Sorry.
