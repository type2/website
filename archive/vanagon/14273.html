Subject: Re: Q:spare.gas.tank

Do what Joel and I do, carry a 1 gallon spare tank from Stainless Steel
Brakes Corporation stored hidden in the middle part of your spare tire. I
think we ordered this from Whitless.


&gt;YOu know those collapsable water carriers that come in increments
&gt;of, say, 1, 2, and 5 gallons?  They are strong plastic (dunno which
&gt;kind of plastic), and have a handle, plus a spigot or spout with
&gt;an on or off selection. When not in use, they fold up into a nice,
&gt;flat thing to store for later.  
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, does something like this exist for carrying gas?  If not,
&gt;would these work?  I don't have the need to to carry extra gas
&gt;often, or for long periods of time, just now and then to guard
&gt;against emergencies.
&gt;
&gt;/martha
