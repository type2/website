Subject: Re: The Cooling Fan Won't Shut Off

try replacing the switch in the radiator .
 it is on the left side mid way up . it looks like a big brass plug w/  2
wirescoming off of it . when they fail the fan stays on. 
 To get to it , drop the spare tire , crawl under and look up to the left on
the rad. The part should be about 25$ new or you can lift one from your local
junk yard for 'bout 3$

good luck
