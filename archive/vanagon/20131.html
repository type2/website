&gt;One thing that irked me while living in California - the small distances

  A simple rule-of-thumb to maintain a safe following distance: For every 
10 mph of speed, allow one car length between you and the car in front.
  Let's say you're going 60 mph on the freeway, that means 6 car lengths.
Once you do this in Calif, at least six cars will merge in front of you.
