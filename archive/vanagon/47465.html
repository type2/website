 My circuit breaker fried and needs to be replaced. Delta Six wants 
 $38 which is reasonable compared to the dealer but are there any other 
 safe alternatives? I was thinking about replacing the breaker with a 
 ground fault receptacle. Does anyone know if this would also act as a 
 breaker if too many amps go through? Please respond directly since I 
 have been relegated to the &quot;other&quot; list 8^) &gt;&gt;
A GFI receptabl does not provide any overcurrent protection.  It works by
monitoring the current through each of the circuit legs.  If there is any
mismatch, it assumes that the difference is flowing through a ground path and
it then trips, shutting off the supply.  A good GFI should trip on as little
5mA of current leakage.  A good electrical supply should be able to provide a
breaker that can be mounted in that box.
