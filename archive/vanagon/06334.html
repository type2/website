Subject: West coast poptop camper BBS

I was throwing out a bunch of old magazines last night and I found
an old issue of hotVWs with some info on a BBS for pop-top campers.

BULLETIN BOARD (BBS) GOES ON-LINE &quot;FOR POPTOPS ONLY&quot;
  On Sept. 1 of this year, a new, free bulletin board (BBS) went
on-line for Poptop Camper owners only, at (818)880-8700.  Anyone
with a computer modem (up to 2400 baud) can connect for the price
of a normal phone call, there is no access charge.
  The bulletin board will be operated by M.L.(Marc) MCCulloch, who
pioneered the aftermarket poptop rubber seal for VW Westphalia
Campers in 1983.  McCulloch hopes that this bulletin board will
provide a badly needed forum for Poptop Camper owners.  Besides the
forum, Marc plans to have guest writers and provide graphics files
containing rare diagrams and parts lists for the campers.
  The Poptop Bulletin Board will be in operation only from 7:00 p.m.
to 7:00 a.m. (Pacific time) during the week (Monday thru Friday),
and all day Saturday and Sunday.  This will give Poptop owners the
opportunity to call when telephone rates are the lowest.  Calls will
not be connected from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday thru Friday.
  Callers are asked to only leave messages that directly relate
to VW Poptop Campers.  Any other informatoin will be removed to
preserve the integrity of the board and conserve space for Poptop
related items.  A limited amount of Poptop advertising will be
accepted.  Advertisers can call (818)880-6802 for rates and infor-
mation.

I called the phone numbers last night and got the *new* numbers
(and a carrier tone in the ear, and a busy signal at the other.)
(310)457-3033 ==&gt; 2400 baud (BBS)
(310)457-8895 ==&gt; Advertising

Currently I'm using a VAX mainframe connected to the Internet
via an Ethernet connection....no modem, or I'd check it out
personally.  Any West coast bus drivers with a modem care to
check it out?  Even better, &quot;Mark, are you out there?&quot;

FWIW,

Jack.
