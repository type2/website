After researching all my handy materials, I have located 3 potential
sites about 35 miles outside of Winston-Salem N.C. I chose this area
because it is right off I-40, which easily connects with I-77, I-85, and
other large interstates. It is under 350 miles from D.C., likewise
Atlanta, (Both trips are all major highway travel except the last 35
miles or so). Southern Ohio is also within the 350 range. (Alabama adds
another hundred or so miles).
    So anyway, what are the opinions of anyone out there possibly
interested? If people say yea, then I will try to call these places and
make sure they are open.(N.C. parks sometimes want to close) Also, if
anyone else has suggestions...
thanks
richard
