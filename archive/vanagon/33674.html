Subject: RE: Speaking of Door Locks


&gt;The handle on my '82' Vanagon's sliding door is getting awfully loose - as 
in
&gt;there is an terrible amount of &quot;slop&quot; relative to the axis about which you
&gt;twist the handle to unlatch the door.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there every take the thing apart or find a way to take up this
&gt;slop?? (Buying a new latch mechanism doesn't count!!!)

I just adjusted min this last weekend, Harvey. Don't know if my problem
matches yours-- my symptom was a door that you had to bang hard on
the handle to get it to open, and finally it just wouldn't open at all
any more.

Pulled the upholstery off the inside of the sliding door, and immediately
saw the rod that goes from the handle (on the left) to the latch (on the
right). It has an adjusting mechanism near the handle, which in my case
was way loose. I tightened it down, and have lived happily ever after.
It's obvious to see how to do it once you get a look at it, and quite
easy.

Hope this helps...
