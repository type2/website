Gasoline is a very good explosive!  Especially when used in a not-to-well=

ventilated area such as your garage.  Do not use it a a solvent or parts=20
cleaner.  We need *all* the members on this list and it's very difficult=20

&gt; I'd like to point out that gasoline is a really good solvent and
&gt; sells for a mere $1.259 a gallon (at least it does here in San
&gt; Diego). Of course it is a little dangerous. Diesel fuel is a little
&gt; less flammable and is priced in the same ballpark.  I wonder if there
&gt; is something that could be mixed with gasoline to make it safe while
&gt; retaining its solvent properties.
