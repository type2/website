Subject: Re: Hoo boy. The list doth split...

Gotta add my zwi pfennigs here:

   I'm surprised that a recognition of excess volume on this list and a
split may occuring now, when I got lambasted for being anal retentive when
asking for better consideration in SUBJECT headings of replies or FS offers
or queries on such a large list.
My gut reaction is Yay, now I don't have to hit the delete button when a
query relates strictly to a Wasserboxer, but some queries were relevant
when about a camper goody or tires - and at least would bolster my feeling
of &quot;yes, who want's a wasserboxer&quot;......Now, will trip reports, FS offers,
offers of caravaning or camping, have to be posted to both lists- and by
whom- the poster, or the list managers, who have to figure out if it's
relevant to both lists?  I agree that those who'd like to be on both lists
(have old and new busses) will wade thru more than twice what it was before
the split, and those who only care about air-cooleds will wade thru less.
So some will be happier, some will be less.  My solution of better posting
ettiquette (sp) would have solved a lot of this, but then who am I to shout
when all regarded me as a &quot;Newbie&quot; who doesn't &quot;get it&quot; or is the only one
with a &quot;smart&quot; mail reader?     Mike Benthin in NJ
