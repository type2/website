Subject: Update the stats

It's time I attempt to rise from the sniveling lurkers category and get 
entered into the stats.  I now &quot;officially&quot; own an 83.5 Vanagon L Westfalia, 
though we're still trying to conquer the cooling problems.  I'm going to try 
to add a new O ring to the thermostat housing tomorrow.  I would like to thank 
all the people who have responded to my questions while assembling this new 
motor. My '84 Vanagon GL died in South East Bumble F&amp;*(* Delaware about 4 
months ago.  It was not cooling properly.  I had taken it to 3 different 
places and they all gave it their seal of approval, &quot;nothing's wrong, no 
leaks, runs great&quot;.  And these were people that knew vanagons.  I looked down 
at the temp gauge on a 90 degree day and saw the red light flashing.   Took 
the last walk back to see the coolant spurting out of the heads.  (deadheads 
would drive by, beep and wave, but not stop.. now that's another story…) I 
won't even get into the AAA story that followed, you are all familiar.  My 
mechanic had this 83.5 out back that he got for $500, the block was cracked 
due to triple A towing it IN GEAR for 150 miles.  It's in perfect condition, 
it has accessories from the rear screen to the awning, all I'm missing is the 
forward table, which I'm currently chasing from Baltimore to PA.  Oh, it also 
has A/C, this I had to have this time, I've had non-A/C VW's for too long.  I 
helped paint it (the original brown, yech) with the big white stripe going 
around.  I don't know how long this rebuilds going to last but I'm getting a 
Canadian VW engine when it does go, I'm sick of rebuilds.

I joined this list right when it was breaking up, wow, there was a surprising 
amount of animosity towards the w/c vanagons.  Orphans, etc.  I originally 
bought the '84 because my wife would not tolerate one more air cooled VW in 
the family, she was sick of waiting for parts, lousy heat and when the heat 
worked it was probably exhaust fumes.

I'm often at Assateque State Park in MD, I always see Westy's there and almost 
always see Syncro's as there are off-road trails there.  Has anyone planned a 
group trip there yet? 

I'm from Phoenixville, PA and I also have a 92 Jetta that my wife drives (she 
needs something reliable).

Thanks,
Bryan
83 Westy (no name, haven't thought of one yet.  BTW, what's the German word 
for Brown?)
92 Jetta (60K miles and the only repair was a broken door handle… grrrr)
