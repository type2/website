According to my '91 Vanagon manual the unloaded height of a Vanagon 
campmobile (presumably a Westphalia camper) is 81.6&quot; (about 6'10&quot;), the 
Synchro version is 82.8&quot; (6'11&quot;).  When we bought ours, we had to replace 
the garage door itself (replacing a one-piece, tilt-up with a sectional 
roll-up), but did not have to modify the door opening.  Please note 
however, that if your driveway or gagage floor slope significantly, the 
floor to top clearance may be effectively less, since the van will span 
the distance from wheel to wheel.
