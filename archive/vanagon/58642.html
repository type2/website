Subject: parts II

Earlier today while going to look at the 4 vanagons I'd previously mentioned,
 a fine upstanding young citizen blew a red light and took out the side of my
Syncro.  Ironic eh?   So....I guess instead of just installing the new tranny
and $2000 worth of other items, I guess the 87 (60k) will be getting new
sheet metal, updated bumpers.....etc., and paint.  The best part of all this
is I can still drive the van, but the rusty old toyota is minus one front
end.  To any old rusty toyota's listening,  never taunt a VW.  Thankfully, no
injuries to anyone involved.  
My question:  Anybody have a set of syncro stickers/graphics?  I need the
front one, the two side, and the rear.
 
Be safe
