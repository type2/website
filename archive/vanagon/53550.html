Subject: Power Steering

I have one Vanagon with power steering and two without.  I don't really
see much difference.  Since there has been discussion about how expensive
the power steering rack is, I was wondering if anybody has replaced the power
steering with the plain?

Oddly, the power steering I've got is on my GL, the lightest of my Vanagons,
and the one you'd expect to need it the least.  My Westfalia (an '80) and 
my Syncro (an '86) both have plain old manual steering, and both steer as
easily as any car I've ever driven.  Considering the complexity and cost,
it amazes me that VW even felt compelled to put it on.

How do other people feel?  I think most US Vanagons had power steering on
them since it was first offered.  Did other countries do this also, or is
this insistence on having power steering an American thing?  Is power steering
common on Transporters?  Others out there have Vanagons both with and without
it too.  How do you feel?  Any other Syncros without, or is mine unique? 

I though about this today while getting my Syncro around a tight parking lot
and realizing that I really didn't like the power steering on the GL.  It 
sure makes the engine compartment seem empty, too, without that pump.  Of
course, my Syncro also lacks A/C, and the engine sits lower, so the engine
bay seems to echo like a deserted warehouse.

I really hate being forced to buy cars the meet &quot;average buyer&quot; profiles.  My
last new car was an Acura Legend -- we wanted a decent sedan with a MANUAL
transmission.  Not much choice in the US -- most cars only come in automatics.
I'd really want a new EV, but even VW takes this stand now, and only will
sell automatics.  I don't know what I'll do for a new car now -- I think that
BMW is the only *nice* car left that comes in a manual.  I'm going to have to
keep my flock of Vanagons alive, I guess.  I digress.  The question I was
about to ask is: Is the power steering really needed (in your opinion) or was
it only needed to sell these in America where you haveta have automatic/power
steering/power brakes/blah, blah, blah?  Should we just convert them when 
there's any trouble?  Is it even possible to convert to plain steering?
