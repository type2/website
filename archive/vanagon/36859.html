Mebe VW AG is *Sniveling* and *Lurking* somewhere and *Spying* us.

That would be the best, cheapest, fastest, and most reliable market
research they ever had.

We know of eachother through this medium and who sez that VW doesn't
know what's going on here?

We know what's going on on the list so we know what they could know of:

-) we want access to their ETKA CD Roms

-) we want SA Vanagons

-) we want Mexican Bugs and Busses

-) we want the Concept one (and two)

-) we want VR6 T4 Transporters and EVs

-) the problems VW owners experienced with their cars and service personel

-) Bob Hoover  :)
