&gt; come on.  My biggest pet pieve so far though is that the defroster won't 
&gt; run without the compressor on.  Why does VW think you need to run the 
&gt; compressor to blow heat onto the windshield?

Dodge does this too and I don't think I like it much.  The idea is that
the compressor aids in defrosting by drying the air that's being blown
on the windshield.  And their reasoning is sound, 'cause when you turn
on the compressor that windshield clears instantly but I'd rather have
it as my option.  My old 4Runner had a little A/C button that you could
push no matter what the climate control was set on.  Was pretty nice.
