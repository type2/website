Subject: Front door speakers - Westy vs. Pass van?

I hate to flog this one too much, but the front speakers on my '88 
Westy are mounted in the door with 4 screws and came out easily, but 
they *are* stock speakers, as shown by a VW sticker on them.
Some mentioned they may not be, so are there different speakers used 
on Westy's ? (the front are also identical to the rear mounted in the 
overhead cabinet).
Just curious.
