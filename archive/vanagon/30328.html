I don't know if what I know about buses qualifies as 'skill' but I am 
game.  No one would want to buy a bus from the rust belt so this is a 
dubious offer at best.  I did offer to look at one recently for 
someone but it sold before I got the chance.  I am in Lincoln, 
Nebraska.  Dead in the middle of Denver and Chicago, three hours from 
KC.  If someone happens to know of a bus around here that needs a 
looking over give a yell.  I need all the hippie karma points I can 
get.  Jim
