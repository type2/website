Hi, all.  This is my first letter to the group.  I inherited my Matilda from
my brother, who was moving away and couldn't take her.  Anyway, although my
brother did most of the asthetic work on her, I still take a great deal of
pride in the fact that she is mine.  So I've got a picture of her up on my
home page _at_ http://ux4.cso.uiuc_dot_edu/~goah/home.html

I was just wondering if anyone else on the listserver had cool pics of their
busses on their home pages.  (I'm not looking for a vw WWW page; i found that
on the FAQ).  I'm interested in seeing just regular folks like you and me
proudly display their MicroBus pride.

Thanks

goah
