&gt;Alright, that should interest you . . . .
&gt;
&gt;The goal here, gentle reader, is to replace our `88 Westy with an 
&gt;earlier,
&gt;CHEAPER version . . . say an `83-`85, plus some cash.  
&gt;
Jean Howland (jhowland_at_netscape_dot_com) sent me an e-mail that she is 
looking to replace her '83 or '84 (watercooled) Westy with a later 
one.  Sounds like a perfect match.  She's in Mass., though...
