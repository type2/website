Subject: Re:  radiator leaking

Hi, Joel,

&gt;but you'll have to find the right spot ... if it is leaking just a tiny bit,
  I have not located any leak yet. But, I have done the cooling system flush for
  4 times this year. Hopefully, I am doing it right the last time. I learned
  through these flushes that air in a Vanagon H2O cooling system can be fatal.
  Since VW shop manual does not say when I lower the front end  and level the
  vehicle during the coolant refill phase. I had to do the trail-and-error. I didn't
  do it right for several times, air stayed in afterward, coolant was pushed
  from the overflow tank to the refill tank after miles of driving, and temperature
  went up too high.

  In my spare time, I help a charitable organization hauling various donated stuff.
  It is great to have a Vanagon. None of the trendy minivans, including the Eurovan,
  can match a Vanagon's cargo space, especially if the center seat is also removed.

Regards,

James
