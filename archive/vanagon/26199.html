&gt; &gt;&gt; The small outlet brass pipe or fitting going to a rubber fuel line to
&gt; &gt;&gt; the carburetor had popped out of the fuel pump. It is apparently just
&gt; &gt;&gt; a pressure fit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have heard of the same fittings falling out of the carb itself.  Anyone
&gt; &gt;have this problem?  Glad to here there was no fire.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I had that pipe pop out of a Weber 32/36 progressive in a '69 bus, many
&gt; years ago. Engine wasn't running, so no fire there either, luckily. I
&gt; mentioned it on this list, and someone said that this was a common problem
&gt; with Weber carbs on many different cars.

&gt; ===============================
&gt; I co-worker had the same problem, brass fuel hose fitting coming off of the
&gt; carb body on his bus.  Just a friction fit.  Also fortunate, no fire.

Ok, so what is the fix for this potential problem?  I don't want to 
burn on the side of the road.  My Weber progressive is brand new.  
What should I do to it?  Or have they redesigned it?  Jim
