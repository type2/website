It is very doable for the Waterboxer engine.  Everything will bolt in.  You 
may have to drill and tap the head to mount the pump bracket.  Also, you will 
have to drop the fuel tank to install the front lines.  While your upgrading 
things, you can also upgrade the front brakes by installing the latter 
spindles with the calipers and brake hoses.  This too bolts right up.

Has anyone ever added Power steering to a pre-'85 Vanagon?
how hard is it to do?
any thoughts?
TIA,
