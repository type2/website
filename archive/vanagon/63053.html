Subject:      Re: EV Norcold fridge woes update

&gt;Andrew that was quite the compilation you put together, thanks.  Any idea
&gt;if these &quot;kits&quot; are covered under warranty or is this going to be a another
&gt;battle?
&gt;
&gt;Macon,  I would be pissed!  But at least we can duplicate it.

I am not pissed yet, just plenty annoyed.  I have hope because Norcold
promised that the Hi Altitude kit is now on the way to our local Winnebago
authorized repair place, and it is scheduled to be installed Friday, July
25th.  This will be just  tim for a ten day trip that we have planned to
Glacier.

&gt;
&gt;Last summer I called Winnebago from Banff about these problems and they
&gt;told me then that the problem was the orifice.  Since I bought my unit in
&gt;San Jose (sea level), the size of the orifice was for sea level and that
&gt;for high elevation I needed a different size.  Sounds like that is not the
&gt;case, right Macon?

Boulder RV tells me that two things are needed:  1) the different sized
orifice (which I think is narrower but I am not sure), and 2) the second
vent to the outside at the bottm of the refrigerator.  I will get and post
details when I see the actual kit, i.e., Hi Altitude Vent Kit, Norcold Part
No. 618960
