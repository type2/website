Subject: Re: JCW oil cooler

Weston said &quot;I put the oil cooler on and it worked wonders  .  .  .  &quot;

  Ok Weston, it's interesting to learn about the oil leak, but it would 
be even more interesting to learn about the &quot;wonders&quot; it worked.  While 
the experience is still fresh in your mind, how about describing the 
differences in temperature you observed in what running conditions.  Also 
please mention what temperature gauge(s) you have and the physical 
characteristics of the radiator.

  Thanks,
  John Wakefield
