Subject: What Derek really needs for his syncro
Date: Fri, 2 Jun 95 12:00:25 EDT

OK, I was watching a little CNN yesterday and saw what the
ultimate syncro add on would be, a guy in the great NW somewhere
is selling add on track attachments for 4wd pickups, turns
your pickup into a snocat tank sort of thing, they were plowing
normal Chevy and Ford pickups through 4-6 feet of frozen mud
bog, water, etc.  Really swift idea, the sort of one that
has me kicking myself going, why didn't I think of it, for
$15k you get four track assemblies, one per wheel than mount
a main driving cog wheel in place of your wheel that drives
a kevlar reinforced track over 4 or 5 roller wheels mounted
onto a steel superstructure below the drive wheel, raises the
vehicle a couple of feet ant provides sufficient stability to
climb 45-55 DEGREE inclines, can be run up to 35 on hard surface
roads, use your standard brakes and steering, seems like an
industrious person could fab their own for a vanagon for about
$5k-$10k but would probably need to install that optional air
cooled flat 6 to give sufficient power.  Oh BTW, whole system
bolts on and off in like less than 1 hr, with a floor jack for
conversion back to standard on road rubber.  Realy really neat.
