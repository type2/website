Subject: More 83.5 cooling

O.K., back to that 83.5 w/ cooling probs.  ( I was on vacation for 10 days, 
without the Westy :(  )  I've got the water pump and thermostat replaced along 
with one of those fan switches that come on a bit earlier then the stock ones. 
 If you will recall, my problem was the temp guage rode in the middle while 
moving and moved up to 3/4 real fast at idle.  Now. the temp rides steady at 
2/3 while driving and drops down to right after the led while idling!  I only 
get to use the shop during the weekends, this is why this is taking so long.  
This Saturday I'm going to pull the radiator (it does feel hot all around it 
though) and flush it.  Any other suggestions?

Thanks,
 
Bryan
