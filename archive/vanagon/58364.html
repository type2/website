Subject: Yosemite access and weather

I have 4 days-off starting Sat, April 19th and my SO and I were considering 
driving the bus to Yosemite (from Santa Cruz).  Have any list members 
visited the park since it opened (late) this year?  I'm wondering if anybody has experienced the 
experienced the &quot;ranger-led convoys&quot; on the 140 between Mariposa and El 
Portal.  I'd also be 
interested in hearing about recent experiences with the reduced camping availibilty 
in the Yosemite Valley area and what the roads were like.  I'll call the 
Park and Caltrans, but nonetheless, would enjoy hearing about and benefit 
from any recent 1st-hand experiences in the park (esp from fellow bus drivers!).
If by coincidence any listees are going to be in the park between the 
19th and 22nd, drop me a line!  Thanks.
