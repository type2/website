&lt;&lt; Does anyone know where to get paint for the plastic center caps on 14&quot;
 Alloy wheels?  The wheels are the 5 spoke greyish mags, they're on an 87. 
 Also, does anyone else have any ideas on how to keep the paint form peeling
 off?  I replaced the original caps about 2 years ago and now almost all the
 paint is gone on all four.  
 
 Thanks &gt;&gt;

I use Krylon paint in a color called &quot;Aluminum&quot;.  It's not an exact match -
you can see a difference if you're looking for it, but it's close.
