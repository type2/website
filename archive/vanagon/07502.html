Subject: Re: Syncro experiences?

don't know tons about the synchro, but isn't it more like a limited slip
differential, rather than true 4WD? BTW I have heard that the Synchro's get
shocking fuel economy.

&gt;     My family has outgrown our trusty 4WD Civic wagon, and as a fond
&gt;     former owner of an early Type II, I'm thinking about starting a search
&gt;     for a Syncro camper. I'm looking for general advice, such as
&gt;
&gt;     1) Effectiveness of Syncro vice 2WD? We use the Honda extensively
&gt;     in snow, and for reaching remote trailheads for backpacking... not
&gt;     hardcore offroad, but some very marginal roads/tracks.
&gt;     2) Technical problems with Syncro vehicles? Anything special for
&gt;     a prepurchase inspection?
&gt;     3) any other things I should consider
&gt;     4) any such vehicles which might be for sale.
&gt;
&gt;     Thanks
