I can send you pictures of crash tests (Vanagon and EV) offered by VW.
Is it that you are looking for?

&gt;&gt; The Eurovan, however, is not considered very safe.  I remember hearing =
the
&gt; Car Talk guys talk about how uncrashworthy the EV was in some test or
&gt; other. ( It might have been consumer reports, or gov't tests, I don't
&gt; remember).

 I'm skeptical.  VW hangs part of their reputation on safety.
 Does anyone have a reference?
