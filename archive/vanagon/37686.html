&gt; Has anyone installed a gauge that will tell you the fill level of the
&gt; propane tank?  I'd really like some way of telling how much propane I have.

I installed one that I got at camping world.  It measures pressure, and
hence doesn't give you a lot of useful information, but it does give an
indication of when the tank is starting to get a little low.  The gauge
usually stays around the middle, and when I see it start to drop I know
I have only a couple of meals more worth of propane.  I only use my tank
for the stove, so this is fine.  Those with propane heaters probably
would want to get a different kind of gauge.  The one I got is inline
between the tank and the regulator.  Took 15 minutes to install, and
costs around $20.
