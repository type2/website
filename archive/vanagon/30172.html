&gt;At this point I'll look at anything.  BTW, the catalytic converter doesn't
&gt;let 
&gt;anything *in*, it lets things *out* (and catalyzes combustion of the excess 
&gt;hydrocarbons)


What I meant to say was that since the cat was plugged, the exhaust gases had
no where to go.  Since nothing could get out of the system, the engine could
not suck in enough air to fire up.  Changing the cat, solved the problem.  By
the way, the inside of the OEM cat was in a million pieces all plugged up at
on end.
