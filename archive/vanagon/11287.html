When I am trying to set my timing, it varies a few degrees
justidiling.,  I am assuming that htis is bad.

What is going on????


What year vehicle is this? If it has an idle stabilizer, do you have it 
bypassed? The stabilizers work in exactly the manner you have described, varying
the timing a few degrees at idle to keep the speed constant.
