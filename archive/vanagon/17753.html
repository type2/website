Subject: Re: 59 single cab question


&gt;Can I put my spare 1600 (70) engine into my 59 (If I make all the necessary
&gt;6 volt conversion). The 36 hp sure looks tiny compared to the 1600. I havent
&gt;measured anything or actually thought about it a lot, but I saw a post were
&gt;someone said that this engine would more or less fit back to 55.

Should work fine.  My '59 has a dual port 1600 in it (previous owner
partially butchered back &quot;firewall&quot; to get it in).

If you're using 12v flywheel you will need to clearance tranny slightly.
