Craig, as a Syncro Westfalia owner, I recently replied to a similar
request as follows:

&gt;I'm collecting information for a future purchase of a bus; I thought I
&gt;once saw a 'Synchro' badge on a Vanagon camper -- is this four wheel
&gt;drive?

It sure is! It is world-class system, built at the Styr-Daimler-Puch
factory in Austria, right alongside the Mercedes 4WD Gelandewagens.
They came with 2.1 litre motors, 14 inch wheels (except for some rare
factory 16 inch wheeled versions), factory skid plates, factory diff
locks front and rear, full-time 4WD via a viscous coupling (designed by
Porsche) differential between front and rear axles, and factory snorkel
air intakes at eyeball height.

To see what these vehicles can do, check out the Syncro Madness Area at
http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/drew/index.html There are also some
more photos, details and links at http://www.sofcom_dot_com.au/4WD/VW/VW.html

&gt;Is it worth having, or is it prone to problems due to the complexity?

It is definately worth having, but they are more expensive to maintain.

&gt;What is the premium paid for a bus with Synchro?

The premium is anywhere from $500 to $5000. It all depends on local
market, condition, etc, and if the unit is a Westphalia Camper.
Usually, you will find early syncro vans (86 or so) for $5000, unless
you find someone who does not know what they have.

Syncro Westphalias are another kettle of fish, unless you luck out.
They combine a highly evolved camper package with the unbeatable
syncro system. In the eyes of many, these are the most desirable
of all late VW vans. There is an 86 on the market right now in New Mexico
for $12,500, with good credentials and careful owners. The 90 and
91s (the last year) are identical and come loaded with power windows,
locks, cruise, heated mirrors, etc. One of these sold in Seattle
recently for $22,000, very close to its new car sticker price in 1990!
More likely, you might find one in the high teens...

As you can tell, I think these are great cars, and you cannot miss
with one!
