Subject:      Re: Blaine - Not to be confused with Blaine

     Ron, Steve, Dave, and all-

     I have NEVER repaired a windshield wiper with chewing gum!

     I do NOT have a brother named Ron!

     I do have a brother named Vaughn.  And he's repaired automotive stuff
     with duct tape, but not to my knowledge with gum.

     Just thought I'd clear all that up!

     (just bein' funny)
