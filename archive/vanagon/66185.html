To quote from the original Camper supplement that came with my '81 Westie...

&quot;When the refrigerator is operating, be sure to park on level ground to
maintain efficient cooling.  If the vehicle remains stationary for any
length of time on gradients exceeding +/-8=B0, the cooling output will be
considerably reduced.  Should level parking be unavailable, it is best to
discontinue operation to prevent overheating of the core which can lead to
permanent damage of the refrigerator.&quot;

&gt;Instructions for the Dometic refrigerator specify not to operate it unless
&gt;it is &quot;level&quot; or damage will occur.  Does anyone know the specifications
&gt;for the maximum limit of tilt tolerated?  What damage will occur if the
&gt;refrigerator is operated outside these specifications?
