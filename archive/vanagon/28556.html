Subject: Crew Cabs are PRICELESS

&gt;Subject: Help: Crew Cabs are worthless

&gt;I need your help.

&gt;I'd like to have some input from y'all as to what you think
&gt;these might be worth, based on bus prices in your area, or
&gt;crew cabs if you know of any.  I can't help but feel that
&gt;almost any driving vehicle is worth $1000.

&gt;If I get some responses, I'd like to use them as evidence
&gt;that Opie really does have some worth (it's bad for his
&gt;self-esteem).

&gt;TIA,
&gt;Dean &amp; Opie

Here is a response for you, straight from _Old Cars Price
Guide_, December 1995 edition.  Your are going to love this.

1968 VW Double Cab Pickup

Condition 6 (Parts Car)     $400
Condition 5 (Restorable)  $1,250
Condition 4 (Good)        $2,100
Condition 3 (Very Good)   $4,200
Condition 2 (Fine)        $7,400
Condition 1 (Excellent)  $10,600

Oh my!

Love your bus all the way to the bank!
