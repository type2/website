Question about 2L engine:

I've got my '82 vanagon air-cooled engine in pieces (many!), and I've got
some questions for the experienced:

Question #1:
The &quot;How To Rebuild Your Air-Cooled Volkswagon&quot; book shows pictures and has
text describing the &quot;windage tray&quot; found attached to and above the oil pickup.
My engine doesn't have one!  Did some engines not have it?  Did somebody leave
it out on a previous rebuild?  The oil pickup doesn't even have a hole for the
bolt to the windage tray, so I am suspecting that either:
   1) Some years of the 2L didn't have windage trays.
   2) The PO rebuilt, lost the old pickup, put on a different one, couldn't
      figure out how to attach the windage tray and what it was for anyway,
      and left it off.

Question #2:
I am paranoid about the dropped valve seat problem.  How prevalent is it?
What is the experience out there with rebuilt heads?  Do I have 'em rebuilt
locally by any shop that says they do VW heads?  (Does anybody have experience
with any shops in the Sacramento, CA area?)  Or should I send them down to
Mark Stephens because he guarantees &quot;No More Dropped Seats&quot; and pay the
shipping charges AND much higher prices (twice as much)?

Question #3:
This engine ate a rod bearing.  I am getting the case tank cleaned, but I am
concerned about cleaning the metal out of the oil cooler.  Should I just buy a
reconditioned oil cooler?  Have a machine shop clean out the old one?  What is
the experience here.  What do YOU do?
