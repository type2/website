Subject: Hydraulic Lifter Removal/FuelVapor Routing

Pretty catchy subject line eh? 
Wanted to kill two birds with one stone. I have two problems, the first of
course is collapsed lifters. I'm going to try and pull them out with a 
magnet like the Haynes manual suggests. Anyone done this before? I'll 
follow their procedure for pumping them back up. Would appreciate any
experienced suggestions on this.
Secondly, I have noticed that the fuel evaporative system has become
disconnected on my 78 Westfailure. The line runs along the back of the
engine compartment (right at the back of the van just above the rear
outside locking door, you just open the door and look up, there it is.)
It seems to come from both sides of the van, and has lines you cansee
from the fresh air vents on the outside on each side of the van. These 
meet in the rough middle inside the van compartment then a plastic 
yellow hose joins them together. There is a T fitting here off the
plastic line that looks like it should run to the air cleaner or
emmsion system somehow but I can't find a connection anywhere. The
remnant of hose thats on it is just long enough to reach the air
filter area. I have taken the air filter system right out etc. and
looked all over. I give up. My local dealer is useless, NEVER go
to HarborView Volks in Nanaimo, they are big time crooks as far
as I'm concerned. Weren't even interested in looking at it for me,
told me they had better things to do.
Anyway, sorry to be so long winded, but I thought I better explain
this thorougly.
Thanks in advance,
C.G. Hook
