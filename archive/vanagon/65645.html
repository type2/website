&lt;&lt;  P.S. Today I'm basking in the glow one feels after narowly escaping
 &gt; death.  I'm beat up but alive!  I took on two burglers, one armed with a
 &gt; shotgun, wrestled with one younger and stronger than me for a gun.  I
 &gt; got the gun, he got shot.  If any of you out there do not own a firearm
 &gt; for self defence, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?  Thanks for listening.
  &gt;&gt;

Am I the only one confused by this?

Do all Vanagon owners need a gun for self-defense?

Do all gun owners need a Vanagon owner to listen to them?

Does anyone actually know the answer to the question...Lean=overheat=damage?
