Subject: Brake prices- '87 fronts


due to some horrible noises (BRAKE noise, not me) on the way home
from a trip to Wisconsin i'll be doing brakes here shortly.  a trip
to the dealer yielded the following:

2 rotors.	Sidug brand, German made.	$75 each
Pad set.	PaDig brand, German made	$40 set
2 seals.	OEM VW				$5 each

and a greasy FLAPS for the bearings...
Inner + outer on both sides	CR brand	$56 all

i'm not familiar with the 2 German brands but the VW service manager
said they use them alot and have good results. they are considerably
cheaper than VW OEM.  to survive in a small town, the service manager
looks for aftermarket parts as an alternative to OEM VW. VWOA
doesn't like this but Auto Import is still in business and has a
loyal following.  the regional rep knows enough to leave this alone.
the rotors LOOK good, with a nice casting finish and a proper hone on
the disk.  the pads are asbestos-free.

mileage on the vehicle is about 179K miles so rather than dink around 
swapping old bearings around in the hubs, i'm replacing them.  one 
less thing to worry about with an aging vehicle.
