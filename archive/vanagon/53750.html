&gt; I replaced the rear bench seat heater core in my 85 Vanagon with a Ford
&gt; heater core the same size and used a plumbers in-line valve instead of the
&gt; factory replacement.  Cost:  $25.00 for the core and $0.85 for the valve.
&gt;  Just go into an auto parts store and have them bring out heater cores until
&gt; youfind one the same dimension (nearly) as yours.
