Subject: Re: Rebuild? Please Help!!!!


Thanks for everyone that helped me out, I changed the oil and in the 
process found where I had an exhaust leak, fixed that, thought I had the 
engine running good, I could rev it up and take it up my steap driveway, 
but I took it out on the road and fifty feet from my house I heard a 
thunk and no more anything, a little smoke out the back, not much, it 
clear in the second it took me to let out a wince of pain and run back 
there, but I soon learned I had a piece of the engine, the part that 
attaches the pistons to the crank sticking out of a hole in my engine block.
I haven't decided if I'm going to sell her or not, but I put a sign on 
her and I'm going to put a post, but $300-$400 for the rebuild if I do it 
myself, I don't know if I can afford that right know, but I love her, my 
first car, VW, aircooled, I might sell her and get a bug, or even worse a 
watercool something.
