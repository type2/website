Subject: Re: Boiling Aligators in Florida

  Now comes Colin A 
&gt;Moran, who writes:  &quot;Bentley shows two switches for the fan on the '86
&gt;and newer vans on comes on at 192degF and the other comes on at 203degF.&quot;

&gt;  But mine's a Diesel Westy.  My question is, are those heat closing values
also correct 
&gt;for the diesel version?  If not, what are the numbers?
&gt;  And you though my subject might have meant something different.

John,
     Bently shows a heat range of 200degF for the first stage and 212degF
for the second stage.   These are turn on temps the turn off temps are about
10 deg F less than the turn on temp.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
