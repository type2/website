Funny to have TWO Syncros for sale. Somebody should grab the sunroof
one -- this is the first one of these I've seen for sale.  A sunroof
in any '86 and newer van is really rare.

&gt; 86 VW VANAGON SINCHRO, engine perfect - rebuilt, new brakes &amp;
&gt; clutch, full sunroof, needs cosmetic work, $5500. (914) 763-6190.
&gt; South Salem
