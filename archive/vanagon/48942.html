OK, folks, a goodnews story.  A clear and calm explanation of my
predicament, and showing the service manager the threads in the drain pan
got immediate results.  They have put in a slightly oversize self tapping
plug, it just got a grip for last 2-3 turns.  They then refilled with Shell
semi-synthetic 20W50, triple the cost of the Castrol I use.  And they will
helicoil the hole for the original plug when I get back from 1500 mile trip.
No hesitation, no disbelief, no bill!  I'm in shock as I type this note. bye
for now, tim
