Dan that VWGuy stated:

&gt;I need two cup holders for my '87 Vanagon. These are the &quot;Flip-Flop&quot; square
&gt;version. Any color is okay (blue if possible) I know it is a small item

If I'm not mistaken, someone posted several months ago about an almost
identical
cup holder as you're describing purchased from K-Mart or Target, or some such
type of business.  It was also inexpensive, so I would start heading in the
general
direction of your nearest store.



WARNING:  Deviation to another thread following:

While I'm here, I might as well economize and note that for those of you w/
window
tint, do not clean your tint w/ any ammonia-based window cleaners; that's
what
causes it to turn purple...  Now, if you wanted purple windows....
