Subject: Re: fixing old heat exchangers

&gt; I turned on the heaters. Actually had a hole clean through one of 'em down
&gt; where they clamp to the exaust. So what's the verdict?

I solved this problem with new pipe ends, they are cheap and are 
availible from most vw catalogs that I have seen.  got mine at a show for 
$6 a pair, sawed off the old pipe ends and put the new ones in.  
they are tapered so they just slip in with a little help from my old 
friend mr hammer and are supposed to bond with the original pipe.  One pipe 
was so eroded i had to have the new end welded on for $5.  they are as 
good as new now.
