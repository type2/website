&gt; Also, any ideas on why my dash battery and EGR lights stay on at start-up
&gt; until I tap the gas?  

I can only help you with the last part of your post, every VW I ever 
owned (including my '85 Vanagon, but excluding my '92 Passat) has done 
this and it seems to be a very common fluke with VWs.  Don't worry about 
it.:)

And all the puppets in this digital jail / They're runnin' around in a frenzy
In search of the Holy Grail. /
They're havin' virtual sex. / They're eatin' virtual food.
No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood.
