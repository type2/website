Subject: model 235



well at bob hufford's goading i am posting this to the list 
:)
 
does anyone have a suggestion on what vendor makes the best 
repro vinyl pullback rooves for a 1960 bus?
 
basically a bus (model 235 komb w/ factory sunroof _and_ bellypans) i am 
hopefully soon to own has a cracked pullback roof that will need to be replaced 
and i need to know which vendor to go w/

also i may ave rehashed this thread but does anyone have any idea what the 
relative scaricity of model 235 is nad if the 60' would have come w/ a &quot;bastard&quot; 
engine??
 
thanks
 
michael
