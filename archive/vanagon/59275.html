Subject: need passenger-side mirror...

I need a passenger-side mirror housing (or assembly) for an '89.  The
powered and heated kind.  Apparently they are the same from '87 and on.
Does anyone out there have one?

To be really greedy, I need a black one.

Please reply to me directly, as I'm getting the &quot;digest&quot; version of the list...

TIA
