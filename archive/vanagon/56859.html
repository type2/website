Subject: Glove Compartment Support-84 Westy

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

The glove compartment in my 84 Westy rides on two shafts on the bottom of
the compartment. At the top left of the compartment is a plastic hanger,
much like a cord which prevents the box-like compartment from rotating on
the two shafts and spilling the contents on the floor of the passenger side
of the cab when the compartment is opened.

That plastic &quot;cord&quot; has snapped, and one end of it is still attached to the
box by a ball which fits into a slit in the lip of the box-like
compartment.  I can't determine where the other end of the broken plastic
&quot;cord&quot; attaches. Has anyone on the list any information about the location
of the top, supporting, attachment end of the &quot;cord?&quot;

Best regards,
