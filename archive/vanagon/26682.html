Subject:       Syncros and Winter

Was in a discussion with two friends yesterday. One has a 4x4 and the 
other has a Vanagon Syncro. They were debating whether the Syncro 
would be a good car in snow ( the snycro has yet to be tested in snow 
by my friend).

After the third beer even I was getting tired of hearing about it, so 
I said I would post here and find out.

The 4x4 argument was that the Syncro wheel base is too long 
for the syncro to be effective in fighting slipping and sliding in 
the snow, becuase of over compensation at the front end.  Of course 
my Syncro friend looked to me for support and I just griped about 
the $300 or so dollars I'm paying to get my CV joints done. (I looked 
at the faq on CV joints and it does seem within my ability - but I 
have nowhere to do it.  Are there such things as &quot;open garages&quot; where 
you can rent a lift for a few hours?)

So my question to all you knowledgable Syncrometers - How does the 
Syncro handle in Snow/Ice Winter conditions?

Thanks!

Matt
