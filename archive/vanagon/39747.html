James Cohen, in response to the remark about a splittie in a black leather 
bra, etc...says:

&gt;That's SEXIST!!!



All depends...never once mentioned the gender of the splittie....it could 
have been female, could have been male (afterall we have nipples), or it 
could have been a Transvestite Type 2!  8)
