Not to continue a completely idiotic debate which seems unappropriate to
the list...but,

        The fact that Jerry drove a beamer really doesn't mean much at
all....now does it?  Are you assuming (you know what they say about
assuming) that any correlation between the Grateful Dead and the
Volkswagen  (probably my two favorite things incidently) has to do with
what kind of car a prominent member of the band drove....that seems a
bit ridiculous.  It seems common sense to assume (..yes I am
assuming...)  that the Volkswagen, and the bus in particular, became
associated with the band due to the amazing fact that they toured (Damn
near constantly) for THIRTY YEARS!  And in those thirty years they
managed to maintain and build upon a fan base which followed them
around...everywhere.  Let's face it... the Volkswagen Bus is a great
tour machine (cheap, easy to fix) as are the uniquely decorated former
school buses which also are a trademark of the Dead tour population.
I'll admit it... I got my '76 westy because of my involvement (..or
should I say obsession...) with the Grateful Dead.  It is simply the
best form of long term private livable transportation I can think of.


No offense intended...but how about we leave Jerry and the Dead alone,
and talk about Volkswagens............If that doesn't work for ya, there
are a whole lot of Dead lists that can provide you with the oppurtunity
to vocalize your stereotypes and assumptions

                                                                thanx
