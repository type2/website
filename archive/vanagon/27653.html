Subject: NJ emissions/Shopping far from home


I have two questions about VW buses...

First, is anyone aware of the new emissions testing laws in NJ, and
how they are likely to affect various models of buses?  My
understanding of the law as it exists (i.e. it has already been signed
into law), is that there will be one emissions standard, typical of
the requirements for &quot;modern&quot; cars (with FI, catalytic converters,
etc.).  The law does NOT make exception for the age of the vehicle or
the emissions standards when the car was produced.

I'm currently shopping for a bus, and I'm afraid to buy anything older
than a '79, for fear of it being taken off the road in a year or two
when this law begins to be enforced.  Does anyone know anything more
about it?  Everyone I've asked about it says, &quot;Oh, they could never
put that into effect, the public outcry would be too loud.&quot;  But, it
looks to me like they *are* putting it into effect, and I hear very
little outcry.  What's the scoop?

Secondly, several people I've spoken to have said what I &quot;need&quot; to do
to find a high-quality bus is search the South and the West.  Find a
good bus in FL/AZ/TX/KS/CA, fly there, and drive it back.  Anything in
the Northeast is highly corroded due to salt in wintertime, and my
hunting experiences thus far have born this out--even busses claimed
to be in &quot;excellent&quot; condition are relatively crappy body-wise.

My question is, how do I go about shopping for a bus so far from home?
Has anyone tried this?  Should I be ordering newspaper subscriptions
and searching classified sections in major southern/western cities; is
there a national sale paper that's worth it's weight in good deals; do
I need personal contacts in the cities I'm searching (to go check out
cars for me)?  I read Bob Hoover's whole account with Grendel, and
that's the type of situation I'd like to avoid--I certainly don't have
Bob's expertise to deal with such an event!  Any thoughts on how to
guarantee that the bus to which I'm flying is actually in the
condition I want?

Many thanks,
Rodney
