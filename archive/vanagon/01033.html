 Hi,

 I've emailed this to the vanagon list as well- hope everyone involved
is happy for me to have done this.

In article &lt;1.4604.1433.0NB59036_at_execnet_dot_com&gt;, you write:
|&gt; 
|&gt;     I left a message to others about this but I will try with you as
|&gt;     well. I have been looking for info about the 6 cylinder engine VW
|&gt;     had developed for the Vanagon but wich never made it to production.
|&gt;     I have been told it is readily available in Europe as an aftermarket
|&gt;     upgrade. Is it true? Its cost? Its availability?

 OK: Interesting topic! Firstly there's a VW van mailing list called
&quot;vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;, subscription requests to vanagon-request,
I think, which has some very knowledgeable people on it. Secondly, I
think what you're describing is actually a Porsche flat-six
conversion- the VW project never really happened but you can do the
Porsche conversion in several ways and Oettinger (German converter)
will sell various big-engined busses.

 Depending on what you want, you may be more interested in a bored-out
engine for the vanagon- I have seen discussions about getting 2.3 litre
versions of the waterboxer from a US source following a European
development, which may also have originated at Oettinger.

 Several people on the Vanagon list were trying to raise interest in
getting together to persuade an American company which expressed
interest in sourcing 2.3 litre engines to tool-up in order to produce
a set of them for interested parties.

 If you are looking for a beefier vanagon I suggest you subscribe to
the list (email me if you have any problems) and then do a troll for
information: you will definitely get feedback from some people who
have researched this area and who are genuinely interested in getting
a workable solution.

 Hope this helps!

Cheers,
	W.
