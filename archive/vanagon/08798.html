Oh, Boy.  Gerry writes:
&gt;As soon as the bleeder came apart, 
&gt;coolant POURED all over the engine -- most of it right on top of the

Wasn't this our &quot;goal&quot; all along &lt;weak, feeble smile&gt;?  

&gt; To stop the flow, I put my finger in the hole.  Since the 
&gt;engine was hot, and the plug had fallen under the car, this was 
&gt;pointless, and finally I let go and just let it flow. 
WHY, WHY, WHY do the damn things always roll under the car when one 
arm (finger, in your case) is locked into crucial duty?

&gt; With the thing 
&gt;apart I looked at it closely and decided that it's not SUPPOSED to bleed 
&gt;anything to the outside air.  It bleeds air between the IN and OUT 
&gt;radiator hoses.  The air that comes out ends up in the expansion tank or 
&gt;(if you've tilted the car enough) flows forward to the radiator.
Gerry!  Eureka!  Your seared flesh was not in vain!  You've solved 
the Great Bleeder Valve Mystery.  Take pride that your experience has 
enriched the collective wisdom of van owners all over the World (BIG 
round of applause and background crowd roar).  Actually, that sounds 
very plausible.  I've always wondered why there was that snarky 
looking assembly between the hoses.

&gt;So, the upshot is folks, according to my experience, the proper thing to 
&gt;do while bleeding is to open the engine compartment bleeder at the 
&gt;beginning of the procedure and close it at the end.  Some of the bubbles 
&gt;you see appearing in the expansion tank are due to the bleeder being 
&gt;open. Nothing should ever flow out of this valve into the engine 
&gt;compartment. 
Looks like FAQ material here folks.  Maybe this could be an entire 
chapter in our 'book.'  Gerry could relate his account of following 
the advice of a completely unknown and (obviously) demented list 
member whereupon it led to a Keystone Cops circus routine in his 
driveway.

Gerry, in all seriousness, I'm sorry the advice I gave you led to 
such a fiasco.  If you're in northern MN sometime and need assistance 
don't hestiate to give me a call.  On second thought, I guess you 
WON'T be doing that!    

I think I'll go crawl under a rock.
