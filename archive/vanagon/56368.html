     Hi All,
     
       The engine in my '85 Vanagon Westy died while I was driving it this 
     weekend.  It shows a complete lack of desire to start.  A quick check 
     on the coil wire shows it's getting good spark and the distributor is 
     turning.  I can smell gas around the engine compartment when I try to 
     start it (could the injectors be stuck open?) and I can here the 
     ticking of the fuel pump when I first turn on the ignition.
       I suspect it is not getting the proper fuel/air but I don't know how 
     to check this since I am a newbie with fuel injection (I know the 
     basic priciples but have never worked dirctly on such a system).  I 
     have tried searching some of the faqs but I have been having problems 
     in both finding any info on basic diagnosing tips and with connecting 
     to the server.  
       Here are some basic questions I am trying to find out:
     1) What systems control the fuel mixture (airflow meter?, does the ECU 
     control only the spark and timing or is it also tied into the 
     injection system)?
     2) How do you determine if the injectors are working properly (I did 
     not want to explore this on the side of the road with a hot engine!)
     3) What methods, tools, and tricks are known to help when diagnosing 
     VW FI systems.
       Any help finding faqs info on these subjects or direct responses to 
     the problem would be appreciated.
     
     TIA,
     
     Vince
