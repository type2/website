Well, I don't think we've bottomed out on where we
will meet on Thursday night ( for those of you leaving
Thursday) but Lost Hills which is just outside of Bakersfield
is a KOA campground that has a no hook-up area that I think
would be a good stopping point for the night.  It's $10 or
less, I don't remember.

I'd like to know who is stopping there and/or if there's another
place you'd like to stop.  It doesn't really matter because
it's just a place to sleep.  I know Bradley wasn't crazy about
stopping at a place that we need to pay because it's just a
sleeping spot.  Personally, I don't care either way.  I just
want to know where people plan to stay.
