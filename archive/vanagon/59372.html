Subject: syncro buying questions

Hey Syncro Dudes-
	I went to look at a syncro this weekend and I came away with 3 questions that
I need help with.
	First-This van just had the gas tank replaced at a dealership and they removed
the transmission.  When I drove the van I could not get it to shift into extra
low or second gear.  My first impression was that it was a problem with the
shift linkage but with the history on those transmissions I could not buy the
van then without checking the list first.  What do you folks think?
	Second- One of the square tubes that run parallel with the drive
shaft(passenger side) was bent up about 1.5 inches.  There was no other sign of
off-road abuse.  Could this be a problem?
	Third- The passenger side front tire was worn more than the rest of the tires.
 Could this be caused by the bent tube from above?  How much of a problem is
this?
	Any input any of you have on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks,

Stephen Davis
Hopeful owner of 87 Syncro
