Subject: Re: Sound system upgrade for Eurobago


&gt;Did you do the radio swap your self? I want to do the same but have not
&gt;figured out how to get the radio out of my 95 Eurobago.
&gt;
&gt;Also does any one out there have the CD changer in a Eurovan, especially a
&gt;Eurobago?  Where is the changer mounted?
