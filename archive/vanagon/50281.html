&gt; Hey Folks--
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine has this Vanagon and was having some problems.  He's not on
&gt; the list and asked if I could post it.  I'm on the Type 2 list, so if you
&gt; could post any relevant ideas directly back to me I would appreciate it.  My
&gt; email is HLPINC_at_aol_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for all your help.

&gt; 1987 Wolfsburg edition Vanagon. Fuel injected.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone encountered the following:
&gt; 
&gt; When I purchased this vehicle, within two weeks, it manifested a cutting out
&gt; and extreme loss of power at highway speeds. Once shut off, It restarts
&gt; immediately.  I complained and the dealer installed a new &quot;engine brain&quot;.
&gt; Seemed to cure the problem except for a minor miss-firing at highway speeds.
&gt; 
&gt; That winter, It started again. At 65mph after 15 or so miles, the engine
&gt; would sputter and eventually quit.  It would re-start immediately and most
&gt; often be fine.  Sometimes it takes two re-starts before it coughs up and runs
&gt; well.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to happen during wet periods.  All other electrical equipment
&gt; operates well except for the usual VW accessories becoming defunct over the
&gt; five years that I've owed this van.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem,  I thought, might be water in the gas line.  Giving the tank a
&gt; dose of dry gas seems to correct some of this.  As I have said, this does
&gt; help, but I've now decided this is a minor additional problem inherent in the
&gt; tank design especially here in New England.  The other night, I barely made
&gt; it home from a 30 mile trip.  I found after dying at least 12 times, then
&gt; pulling off the road, waiting, and then re-starting, that I can keep it going
&gt; by turning off the engine at speed and then turning it back on with the key
&gt; quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have to replace the engine brain again $985.00, or is there an injector
&gt; controller or sensor that is wacko?  Or just a part of the engine brain? 
&gt;  
&gt; 
    You have a problem with the temp. sensor not making a good 
    connection. I found a problem in the wiring where the engine 
    rocks. Check wires to the computer with ohm meter. Pull on wires
    in the engine compartment and check again! DO NOT REPLACE THE
    BRAIN. IT is working fine.
