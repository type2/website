&gt; 	Thats right, after months of bitching and moaning,
&gt;and replacing my entire ignition system, I finally got
&gt;my FI to work correctly (or good enough).

Super!

&gt;Has anyone ever went to a job interview drving their breadloaf?

No, but when Maria and I got married 1 1/2 year ago, we preferred the bus
to the limo on the way to the reception, after church.

PS: Please everyone, check your fuel lines, or at least one that's easily
accessible. I had one burst yesterday: scary!
