In a message dated 96-10-10 21:51:14 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I was told they are manufactured under the same patent as Bilstein
 only made in Japan. &gt;&gt;

Jeff they are similar in concept....but the bilsteins are superior and last a
lifetime...believe me Ive seen them last many more miles than the KYB's and
the price diff is not that great when amortised out for the life of your
van..
