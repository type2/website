A couple of additional items from the previous post: those temps are
celsius; and if air does get in stuck in the heater matrix it is very
difficult to get out; so it makes sense to purge the system of air
with the heater system fully on; pressure testing the rad cap and
system (or equivalent) will verify if you have leaks that are sufficient
to allow air into the system. DC

PS if you find that you are periodically having to top up the system
then this points to air.
