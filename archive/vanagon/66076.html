&gt; Here are my questions,
&gt; 1. Any thoughts on a novice trying an overhaul?

Well, it certainly CAN be done by a novice; I rebuilt the Type1 motor
in my old '64 when I was in my teens (many, many years ago) and I've
rebuilt the Type4 motor in my current '81.  HOWEVER, you need quite a few
tools, quite a bit of time (everything ALWAYS takes longer than you
think) and you'll undoubtedly sweat bullets worrying about things you
might have forgot, worrying about things you come across that aren't
fully explained in ANY book, and wondering if you made a mistake in
undertaking this project.

There's also the issue of costs; if you have to buy or rent tools, pay
retail for parts, pay retail for machinist's time, etc., etc. you'll be
hard-pressed to end up paying less than the quote you're getting from the
shop.

If this isn't a daily driver, if you have some mechanical skill and/or
confidence in your ability, if you want a &quot;project&quot; and the satisfaction
of (hopefully) doing the job right yourself, and you don't mind investing
in some tools that you can use later, then go for it!

The short answer to your question as to whether a novice can rebuild this
engine is &quot;Yes&quot;.  Only you can determine if you should do it.

&gt; 2. Anyone in the Atlanta area who would want to help me (I would pay
&gt; hourly rate for time spent helping me)?

I'm no help here.

&gt; 3. Any referals to good quality mechanic in the greater Atlanta area?

I'm no help here either.

&gt; 4. Should I take the metal found to a different mechanic for a second
&gt; opinion?

This is a tough one and one somebody with more experience than I have can
probably answer better.  If you have real confidence in this mechanic,
then why bother?  But if the car was running good, not making any noises,
etc. I'd wonder where those shavings came from.  Perhaps an oil pressure
test could help in the diagnosis?
