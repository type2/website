&gt; A friend of mine, when he had an '81 Westfalia was curious enough about
  oil temperatures that he called a support engineer at Pennzoil. The outcome
  of their conversation was: The correct temperature for modern multigrade 
  oil is 210-230 degrees F. If an excursion to a temperature above 300 
  degrees F is taken, the oil should be changed at the nearest opportunity.

  This guy's Vanagon was pretty completely instrumented, and I _think_ he said
  that the heads usually ran about 100 degrees F hotter than the oil.


  Now, I check my engine temperature by seeing whether or not I can boil spit
  on the oily end of the dipstick..... (usually not, by the way)
