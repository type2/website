so bradley, what's wrong with vanagons? martha won't let you sit in hers
anymore if you're not careful.

regarding sergio, i think his frustration with vw service problems has
poisoned his feelings about the vehicle. i got the feeling from his earlier
posts that he liked the van until he let vw do the fuel injection recall work.
the more he complains about vanagons in general as being pieces of shit, the
less sympathy he's going to get from people on this list. there are a lot of
people here who are very happy with their vanagons, and we get defensive when
someone attacks them. it's a good thing he didn't start this about eurovans
and have ric get after him ;-) (i know, ric, this never would have happened to
a eurovan).

btw, sergio, even the idiot's guide wouldn't help your mechanic, as it doesn't
cover wasserboxers.
