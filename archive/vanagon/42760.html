     We are leaving for Manassas, Va. Sat Morning, and 2 yrs ago stayed at
Pohick Bay State Park- was told on the aircooled newsgroup that there was a
place closer to Manassas where a lot of Westies/campers stay and caravan
out in the morning- can someone please e-mail me the details/directions
a.s.a.p when coming from the North (around D.C. from NJ)???  Can one get
reservations or is it first come....have 9, 10 yr old going- any activities
in the area they'd like, such as swimming?  Thanks!
   78 Camper, beige with the green round box on top, puttin' with original
heart at 166K mi !!
