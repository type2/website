We are thinking of getting the Westy painted professionally (ie MAACO)and
had a few questions:
a) is there a &quot;good&quot; way to paint the fibreglass roof with it on? b) Would a
darker or lighter colour be better? c) Would auto enamel be ok for the
fibreglass roof? d) Is it possible to strip the body right down to the
bare bones (ie removethe door handles, mirrors, bumpers etc) in an easy
and efficient way? e) do you recommend a prepatory self-sand job with the
paint put on professionally or should they do everything?

We are painting the Westy because it is in excellent shape but has some
scratches and faded paint. We would like to return it to its original
condition. The next step will be to replace the peeling and cracked
&quot;wallpaper&quot; in the interior.....

Thanks - DC
