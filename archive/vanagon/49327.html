I believe they used to call those 'card tables' ? !   

Seriously, I've had great luck &amp; good service from a suitcase shaped/sized
unit that unfolds into a small but serviceable table plus seating for four
(!) Quite a bit sturdier than it has any right to be, &amp; has lasted 5-6 years
so far.  They're available in places like  K-Mart, Walmart, etc for ~$50
(probably cheaper than the plywood &amp; fittings it would take to make one).

This is my signature - &amp; yup it's still stoopid !
