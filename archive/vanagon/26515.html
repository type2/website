It's different on a '77.  It's a molded piece of rubber right under the 
entrance to the filler.  The metal thing that is the entrance is bolted 
on with 4 screws.  I know what you're talking about on the '71 though, I 
have a 15 gallon tank from a '70 that I'm going to put in my '66.  It's 
just 3&quot; rubber hose.
