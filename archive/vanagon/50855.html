Subject: radio in Vanagon question
Date: Thu, 24 Oct 96 21:54:15 EDT

Hello all,
Since I will (hopefully) be soon buying an early air-cooled Vanagon, I
was wondering how the radio mounts in these.  All the ones I've seen
(that had radios) had them mounted vertically near the floor on that
center part of the dash.  My question is, how does one mount a CD player
in a Vanagon?  I know someone out there with an early Vanagon has done
this somehow.  I know that I can't just slap my CD player in there
vertically and expect it to play.  Talk about skip city!  Plus the
instructions say not to mount it at more than a 20 degree angle.  Anyone
who's got a CD player setup in their Vanagon please write and tell me
how you did it.

Thanks,
Sean
