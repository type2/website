Subject: Vanagon Sparkplugs Wires

Hi All!

Just a quick question to all fellow Vanagonowners.  Is there a special way to
get the sparkplug wires off?  Just pulling like on the '72 doesn't seem to
work.  Please help!  I still haven't come up with the bucks ($85 at Westside
VW before my 15% VW Club discount) to get a Bentley.
