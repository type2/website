Subject:      Luggage Racks

Hi to all in Vanagonland.
My 81 Westy is a very nice fella.  However, he needs many things
attended to at once.  Thanks to all of you who have provided information
about the various heat sources.  I want a Propex Heater and will try to
get one.  Now, I turn to some of the other issues facing BaseCamp.  My
front windshield is cracked.  Is it a really big job to replace a
windshield or would it be more prudent to take it to a local glass shop
for replacement (is one brand of glass as good as another)?  The BIG
project I wish to undertake is a two piece roof rack.  I want one which
conforms to the shape of the top and which stretches from end to end
(custom made, of course).  Do any of you know someone who is
particularly proficient at rack-making or manufacturing?  I can provide
drawings.  Of course, I want the rack to be strong but light, i.e., made
of some hollow tubing of some kind.  In addition, I am thinking of
having a ladder made to go up from the front bumper in front of the
windshield on the passenger side.  Semi permanent mounted, I think.  Has
anyone tried this before?
Many thanks.
