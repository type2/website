My 88 Westy has the OXS light that is supposed to come on at 90K.
However, shortly after I purchased the van (new) it was recalled by VWoA
for faulty OXS light relay. Evidently they put in the lights that come
on after 60K (used in all other 88 VW's). Their fix? disconnect the LED!
and &quot;just remember to have it checked at 90K&quot;  So to those of you who
have an 88 and were not the original owner you may find the OXS light
disconnected or the light coming on at 60K.
