&gt;&gt;Naw, you're thinking of Andrea Dorian, the lady with the picture in the
&gt;attic
&gt;&gt;that kept getting older.
&gt;
&gt;no, no, no ... the picture in the attic that kept getting older was
&gt;Dick Clark!!! :)

&gt;you're thinking of Andreas Deloren, the guy that made that funny little car
&gt;out of stainless steel and Volvo parts. :)

ROFLOL!!    You all are such a riot!      _at_--&gt;---      _at_---&gt;----     I've
been away for the weekend - working on the bus, what else??  Story at 11:00.
I'm glad you all had such fun while I was gone!  But keep the noise down, I
need to get some sleep, OK?
